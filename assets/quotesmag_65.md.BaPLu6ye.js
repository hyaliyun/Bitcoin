The Aramaic inscription of Laghman, also called the Laghman I inscription to differentiate from the Laghman II inscription discovered later, is an inscription on a slab of natural rock in the area of Laghm√¢n, Afghanistan, written in Aramaic by the Indian emperor Ashoka about 260 BCE, and often categorized as one of Minor Rock Edicts of Ashoka. This inscription was published in 1970 by Andr√© Dupont-Sommer. Since Aramaic was an official language of the Achaemenid Empire, and reverted to being just its vernacular tongue in 320 BCE with the conquests of Alexander the Great, it seems that this inscription was addressed directly to the populations of this ancient empire still present in northwestern India, or to border populations for whom Aramaic remained the language used in everyday life.A new Aramaic inscription of Asoka found in the Laghman Valley (Afghanistan), Andr√© Dupont-Sommer Proceedings of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1970 114-1 pp.158-173 Epigraphical context The chance discovery by two Belgian anthropologists of this inscription in 1969 is one of a set of similar inscriptions in Aramaic or Greek (or both together), written by Asoka. In 1915, Sir John Marshall had discovered the Aramaic Inscription of Taxila, followed in 1932 by the Pul-i-Darunteh Aramaic inscription. In 1958 the famous Bilingual Kandahar Inscription, written in Greek and Aramaic was discovered, and in 1963 the Greek Edicts of Ashoka, again in Kandahar. In the same year 1963 and again in Kandahar, an inscription in \\"Indo-Aramaic\\" known as the Kandahar Aramaic inscription or Kandahar II was found, in which the Indian Prakrit language and the Aramaic language alternate, but using only the Aramaic script. The Aramaic parts translate the Indian parts transcribed in the Aramaic alphabet. A few years after this description was discovered, in 1973, the Lahmann II inscription followed.History of Discoveries and identifications from M. Boyce / F. Grenet, A History of Zoroastrianism, Zoroastrianism under Macedonian and Roman Rule, 1991. The inscription The text of the Aramaic Inscription of Laghman has been transliterated into the Roman alphabet and translated as follows: Interpretations The Laghman Valley was a compulsory stop on the main trade route from India to Palmyra. The translation is slightly incomplete but brings some valuable indications. It first mentions the propagation of moral rules, which Ashoka will call \\"Dharma\\" in his Edicts of Ashoka, consisting of the abandonment of vanity and respect for the life of the people and animals (here, urging people to give up fishing). The word \\"Tadmor\\" in the Laghman inscription (top, right to left), compared to \\"Tadmor\\" in the Imperial Aramaic script (middle), and in the modern Hebrew script (bottom). Then, according to semitologist Andr√© Dupont- Sommer, who made a detailed analysis of the script observed in multiple rock inscriptions in the Laghman valley as well as in other Aramaic inscriptions of Ashoka,Script of the Laghman Valley Fig 3 the inscription mentions the city of Tadmor (Tdmr in the Aramaic script in the inscription, ie Palmyra), destination of the great commercial road leading from India to the Mediterranean basin, located at a distance of 3800 km. According to the reading of Dupont-Sommer, Palmyra is separated by two hundreds \\"bows\\" from Laghman. In the inscription, the word used to indicate bow is \\"Q≈†TN\\", and Dupont-Sommer asserted that it is an Aramaic word denoting a unit to measure a distance of 15 to 20 kilometres, which could represent a day on the road for an archer. Other distances are then given, which makes it possible to interpret Laghman's inscription as a kind of information terminal on the main trade route with the West. Franz Altheim and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl read three hundred instead of two hundred bows; they equated it with the Vedic unit of measurement yojona, c. 12 kilometres, which would result in a number close to the actual 3800 kilometres distance between Laghman and Palmyra. The linguist Helmut Humbach criticized the reading of Dupont-Sommer and considered his claims regarding the distance to have no validation. Another issue is that the Aramaic alphabet, the letters \\"r\\" and \\"d\\" share an identical character. Jean de Menasce read the city's name \\"Trmd\\" and identified it with Termez on the Oxus river. Linguist Franz Rosenthal also contested the reading of Dupont- Sommer and considered that the inscription refers to an estate called \\"Trmr\\". Historian Bratindra Nath Mukherjee rejected the readings of both Dupont-Sommer and de Menasce; he contested the large value attributed to \\"bow\\", considering it a small unit. The historian also rejected the reading of Tdmr and Trmd as referring to a city; in the view of Mukherjee, the name, whether Tdmr or Trmd refers to the rock on which the inscription was carved itself. The Aramaic Inscription of Laghman is the oldest of the known Ashoka inscriptions, with the Kandahar Bilingual Inscription, both dated to the year 10 of Ashoka's reign. Another Aramaic inscription, the Lahmann II inscription, almost identical, was discovered nearby in the Laghman Valley, and published in 1974.Essenism and Buddhism, Dupont-Sommer, Andr√©, Proceedings of the sessions of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1980 124-4 pp.698-715 p.707  See also  * List of the Edicts of Ashoka * Kandahar Bilingual Inscription * Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India Chapter 4 by Vincent Arthur Smith: The Rock Edicts (this version) Sources  * References Category:Archaeological sites in Afghanistan Category:Aramaic inscriptions ","title":"Aramaic Inscription of Laghman"},{"id":"58029980","text":"Muhammad Aslam Abro is a Pakistani politician who has been a member of the Provincial Assembly of Sindh since August 2018.

Ancoma However, a number of communities of runaways continued to thrive in the Blue Mountains in the decades that followed the 1740 treaty between the Windward Maroons and the British colonial authorities. The leader of one of those runaway communities was an escaped slave named Ancoma. His community thrived in the forested interior of the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains in the eastern parish of what is now Saint Thomas Parish in the mid-1750s. In 1759, two women, one of them a Maroon, conspired to kill Ancoma, and they received rewards from the Jamaican Assembly for their accomplishment. However, runaways continued to live in Ancoma's community for years after his death, and they continued to be a thorn in the side of Jamaican planter society.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 109-110.

These Maroons were already freedmen when they killed Jack.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 113-4. Aftermath Several of Jack's lieutenants were tried at the court in Yallahs, and sentenced to death. However, other deputies of Jack's continued to lead his runaway community in the years that followed his death. The Assembly offered rewards for the apprehension or killing of two of Jack's deputies, Dagger and Toney. In 1792, the colonial militia captured Dagger, and sentenced him to be resold into slavery in the Spanish colonies, but they were unable to catch Toney or the rest of Jack's community, which continued to live and thrive in the Blue Mountains.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 116-7. In 1798, when he was approaching old age, Reeder petitioned the Jamaican Assembly for a pension, detailing his role in killing Three Fingered Jack, and he received his annual pension three years later. When he died in 1816 in Charles Town, and was buried in a Maroon funeral, Little Quaco, who had by now converted to Christianity and was now named William Carmichael Cockburn, petitioned the Assembly for his pension, and it was granted to him.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 114-5.

It stars Kelly Reilly, Sadie Sink, Lili Taylor, Max Martini, and Charlie Shotwell. The film was produced by Paramount Players, MTV Films, Intrepid Pictures and Bellevue Productions and was released on October 18, 2019, by Netflix, making it the first film from Paramount Players to not receive a theatrical release. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its performances and atmosphere, and criticism for its slow pacing and tone.  Plot  Eli Miller is a young boy suffering from a rare disease that causes severe allergic reactions to the outdoors, forcing him to live his life in protective gear. His parents, Rose and Paul, have taken him to Dr. Isabella Horn's secluded medical facility, a large, old house that has been modernized and quarantined. Eli is initially overjoyed that the facility allows him to remove his \\"bubble suit\\", embrace his parents, and enjoy comforts previously denied to him. His joy is short-lived, however, as he begins to experience supernatural phenomena in the house. He also begins his treatments, which are excruciatingly painful. The spectres repeatedly leave him the message lie, and Eli begins to wonder if they are trying to warn him about Horn's treatments. Eli befriends Haley, a young girl with whom he speaks through a large window in the house's first floor. She is the only person who believes his claims that the house is haunted. She tells him none of the other patients Horn treated left the facility, implying that they died. Eli discovers the word \\"LIE\\" is actually the inverted number 317, the passcode to Horn's office. When he investigates the office, he finds Horn's records of past patients, showing that all of them were killed by the third final treatment. Eli unsuccessfully tries to persuade his parents that they need to leave the facility but Paul tries to drug him into unconsciousness. Hurt and confused, Eli barricades himself in Horn's office. He finds a photograph of Horn and her assistants dressed as nuns, and a hidden passageway to an underground room with religious paraphernalia. Horn locks him inside and he experiences an allergic reaction and passes out. When he awakes, he finds he can breathe fine, and he actually has no disease. Rose, feeling guilty for deceiving Eli, goes to him. Eli pretends he's still unconscious. When she opens the gate, he knocks her unconscious with a crucifix and flees but is recaptured by Horn and his father. His mother regains consciousness and finds a dagger in the crucifix. She also discovers that the stone monument in the room conceals the bodies of Horn's previous patients, bound and adorned with religious symbols. Horrified and enraged, she forces her way into the treatment room but Paul subdues her. It is then revealed that Eli is actually a child of Satan, and his \\"allergic reactions\\" were manifestations of his emerging powers. Horn begins the third \\"treatment:\\" a religious ritual meant to end Eli's life. When she tries to stab him with the sacrificial dagger, Eli uses telekinesis to lift Horn and her assistants in the air, spin upside-down (resembling the Cross of St. Peter), then bursts into flames. He also sets the house afire. Eli's mother reveals that she wanted a son so badly, she turned to Satan, who lied that Eli would be a normal child. Eli's father advances with the dagger, but Eli kills him by crushing his face. Eli and his mother leave the burning house, where Haley greets them. Again telling Eli he is stronger than the others, who were his half siblings, devil children too. She reveals that she too is a child of Satan, and that she was unable to tell him, as he had to find and prove his own power. She offers to take Eli to his true father. When he accepts, Haley wonders if Eli can trust his mother. He indicates that he can, and the film ends with Rose driving the two children away from the burning facility.

He was also Master of the stewards for a short time in 1274. He was a confidant of the Hungarian monarchs during the internal wars. Ancestry and family Herbord was born into the gens (clan) Osl, which originated from Sopron County. He was one of the seven sons of Osl I, the first known member of the kindred, who founded a Premonstratensian monastery in Csorna. Herbord's brothers were Beled, who was Master of the cupbearers in the court of Duke B√©la and ancestor of the Vicai family, which existed until 1873; Osl II, who served as Master of the treasury and Ban of Severin, and was also ancestor of the Ostfi family; Benedict, Bishop of V√°rad then Gy≈ër; Nicholas, who functioned as isp√°n of Gy≈ër County; Thomas, who did not hold any courtly positions, was forefather of the Csornai and Kanizsai noble families; and John, whose branch died out by the early 14th century. Herbord had two children from his unidentified wife: his son was Herbord II, also called with the surname Herbortyai, who was last mentioned by contemporary records in 1321. He had a son Stephen. Herbord's branch, which remained marginal in the nobility, became extinct between around 1453 and 1455.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Osl 1.) His only daughter was Catherine, who married John Cs√°k (\\"the Greyhound\\") from the Kisfalud branch of the gens Cs√°k. She was deceased person by 1258 and her marriage produced three children; through them she became matriarch of the Mih√°lyi then Cs√°ky de Mih√°ly noble families.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Cs√°k 4., Kisfalud and Mih√°lyi branch) Military and court service Herbord Osl grew up in the royal court of Andrew II together with Duke B√©la, therefore possibly he was born in the early 1200s. He belonged to the group of so-called \\"royal youth\\" (, ), who supported the monarchs and took a leading role in royal military campaigns. He was first chronologically mentioned by contemporary documents in 1230, when participated in the military campaign of the duke, who crossed the Carpathian Mountains and laid siege to Halych together with his Cuman allies. It is possible that he also fought in the post-1235 wars against the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, following B√©la IV asenceded the Hungarian throne after his father's death. During the First Mongol invasion of Hungary, when B√©la escaped after the disastrous Battle of Mohi, took place on 11 April 1241, and fled to the coast of the Adriatic Sea, Herbord left behind his estates and joined to the royal companion to Croatia and Dalmatia by the end of June. The king took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir and entrusted Herbord to protect his eldest son Stephen at the fortress of Klis. Subsequently, he was one of the nobles, who protected the western boundary against the raids of Frederick the Quarrelsome. Herbord besieged and successfully recaptured the castle of K≈ëszeg with his own army from the Austrian and Styrian troops, according to a royal charter of 1248. For his success and loyalty, he was granted landholdings beyond the Drava river. According to the royal charter of 1248, he was sent to foreign courts in several occasions as an envoy and representative of the Hungarian king throughout in the 1230s. He acted in this capacity primarily on behalf of princes Coloman then Rostislav, pretender to the Principality of Halych. It is possible, that he was involved in Hungarian legations to the Polish and Bohemian realms too. He also served his monarch in Dalmatia as his loyal trustee following the Mongol invasion. Especially since the 1250s, Herbord was commissioned to act as a pristaldus (royal commissioner or \\"bailiff\\") by B√©la IV. For instance, when the monarch judged in the lawsuit between Amadeus Pok, Bishop of Gy≈ër and the burghers of Sopron over the property right of port duties in Lake Fert≈ë (Neusiedl) in 1254, Herbord and a delegate of the Pannonhalma Abbey drafted the borders in the region. He again appeared as a pristaldus during a revisory act of the donation of Vasv√°r in 1256. He led an investigation in the case of lands Bab√≥t and Monoros in 1262. Alongside the abbot of the Klostermarienberg Abbey (Borsmonostor), he inaugurated the isp√°nate (lordship) of Locsm√°nd (present-day Lutzmannsburg in Austria) to the ownership of Lawrence Aba, Master of the stewards in 1263. He usually functioned as pristaldus in connection with legal affairs in Sopron County in the second half of the 1260s too. He remained loyal to B√©la IV, whose relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. He was referred to as baron (thus a holder of a royal dignity) in 1266, but the royal charter did not specify his office. It is possible that he served as Master of the horse or Master of the cupbearers sometimes in the 1260s. Herbord was considered a loyal partisan of B√©la IV. During his court service, he has successfully increased his fortune. He first appeared in contemporary documents in this context in 1238, when bought a vineyard from the nobles of ≈êrs√©g for 26 marks. In the next year, he filed a lawsuit alongside his brothers against their relative Nicholas, son of Szatm√°r, who donated some of his landholdings in Sopron County to the Knights Templar. However their verdict was unsuccessful, as B√©la IV confirmed Nicholas' last will and the donated lands remained property of the chivalric order. Herbord acquired the land of Sz√©plak from his nephew John by pledge in 1261, in addition to some portions in Csorna. He bought Pertel (today Magyarkereszt√∫r) in 1269. He gained the estate Bezeg from Nicholas √Åkos via a lawsuit; the land laid in the neighbor of Cs√°va (present- day Stoob, Austria), which then was the centre of Herbord's domains. He was granted the land Rasina in Slavonia by B√©la IV in 1248; this is the only known royal donation for Herbord, who founded a nearby village, which was subsequently called Herbortya after him. Following acquiring estates in Sopron County, he moved to Sz√©plak, where he intended to build a new residence. Despite his efforts, his aspirations to increase the number of possessions remained marginal and confined, as compared to his powerful neighbor lords, the K≈ëszegi family and the Cs√°k clan. When Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne after his father's death in 1270, the newly crowned monarch permitted Herbord to build a fortress at Lake Fert≈ë in order to strengthen the Western border against Ottokar II of Bohemia. Last years as baron Following the sudden death of Stephen V and the coronation of the child ruler Ladislaus IV in 1272, Herbord was made isp√°n of Tolna County, according to two royal charters in November. Following that, he was appointed isp√°n of Baranya County still in that year. He again served in this capacity from 1273 to 1275, and for a short time in 1277. While holding the latter office, he and his namesake son had various lawsuits and hostilities with local baron Conrad Gy≈ër, who owned extended lands in the county (some historians claim those documents referred to Herbord from the gens Hah√≥t). Herbord elevated into the position of Master of the horse in late 1273, holding the dignity until the next year, simultaneously with his position in Baranya County. During that time, the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìGutkeled‚ÄìGeregye baronial group governed the kingdom, obtaining the majority of the dignities of the royal court, but considerably Herbord did not belong to their alliance. He lost his office at the same time, when the K≈ëszegis were expelled from the power after the Battle of F√∂veny, but Herbord was appointed Master of the stewards thereafter. Nevertheless, he bore the title only for few days in September 1274, when he was replaced by Nicholas Pok. Ladislaus IV donated R√°bakec√∂l to Herbord in 1276; he exchanged the land for some other estates in Sopron County in the next year. He was again appointed as Master of the horse and isp√°n of Baranya County in the first half of 1277; the Cs√°k baronial group obtained the majority of positions during that time. Soon, Herbord was replaced by Peter Aba still in that year, around November. He was last mentioned as isp√°n of Vas County by a royal charter in March 1279. It is possible that he is identical with that unidentified nobleman H., as only the first letter was preserved from his name in a charter of August 1279, who was mentioned as Master of the horse and isp√°n of Moson County. Herbord was referred to as a deceased person by 1280, when his son Herbord II donated some of his inherited lands to the Premonstratensian monastery of Csorna, in accordance with his father's last testament.

She won numerous awards as a singer and composer, branching into acting. After a surgery to remove polyps on her vocal chords in 1985, she became a business woman. Since 1993, she has worked in the field of animal welfare and has published several books about animal care. She has periodically returned to television in guest appearances and in 2010 resumed singing and composing. Early life Sagara was born in 1945 in Tokyo. She suffered from severe shyness from childhood, but had a love for music. Raised in a wealthy family, her grandfather is the major shareholder of Tomoe Industries, she began music training with jazz singer at the age of sixteen. She enrolled in Nihon University College of Arts to study television direction and originally wanted to produce music programming for Fuji TV. While she was in university, she continued singing at such venues as Nikko Music Salon mainly to gain an understanding of the performer's perspective. When she graduated in 1967, Fuji was not interested in hiring a woman producer, but she was approached by a scout from The Japan Victor Company who was looking for new singing talent. Career Sagara debuted as a singer with the song The World for Two People (), which won her the Best New Artists Prize at the 9th Japan Record Awards in 1967 and sold 1.2 million copies. She became known for her distinctive style and had many hits throughout the country. In 1969, she won the grand prize for If It Is Happy, If It Is Sad () at the 11th Japan Record Awards, presented by the Japan Composer's Association for best new record and performer. The win marked the first time the top honors had gone to a woman. Beginning in 1967, Sagara was invited to sing at the Year-end Song Festival, known as \\"K≈çhaku\\", hosted by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (). For thirteen consecutive years, she participated and placed in the finals for the competition five times. In 1972, she won the annual singing battle and repeated her win in 1974 and 1976. Her music career led Sagara into acting, as she composed the theme song for the television drama Arigatou (Thank you), which aired from 1970 to 1974. She was a featured actress in the final season of the program. In 1977, the mayor of Hiroshima, the Chamber of Commerce, and executives of the Hiroshima Bank organized a festival underwritten by the Chugoku Shimbun and RCC Broadcasting in honor of the resilience of the citizens in surviving the bombing and celebrating peace and the joy of living. Sagara was selected as the featured singer for the inaugural Hiroshima Flower Festival, and sang the theme song, Hanaguruma. In 1980, a woman claiming to be Sagara's former partner outed her as a lesbian on TV Asahi's Afternoon Show, causing the collapse of her career. Sagara denied the alleged affair and the woman retracted her statement, but the damage was done, as invitations to the premier award shows disappeared. She did continue to work in music for a few years, releasing a single YASUKO„ÅÆÂ†¥Âêà (Yasuko case) in 1983 and then a jazz album to honor her former teacher Mizushima in 1986. After completing the album, Sagara lost interest in her music career. The following year, she had surgery to remove polyps on her vocal chords. She was told that after the surgery she would be unable to sing for a year. Sagara took a 9 to 5 job in her family business. Wanting to work with animals, Sagara began a company, Animal Fanciers's Club, in 1993, in Nasushiobara in the Tochigi Prefecture. Her focus is on rescuing dogs and cats and improving animal welfare. At the facility, she trains dogs and does outreach, inviting internationally known lecturers to educate the public about proper care of animals. Since 2003, she has published books dealing with animal care. In 2010, after two decades away from the music industry, Sagara released an album, „ÅÑ„ÅÆ„Å°„ÅÆÊú®Èô∞ (Shades of Life). After hearing the song, she was selected in 2011 to compose and sing the theme song for the TBS series Izakaya Henji.

Historians say that the wall varied in thickness, as it crossed various locations. Some places were wide enough for sentries, while other places could even accommodate horses. At strategic points, where there could be threats, there was an opening for canons to be mounted. The wall initially had 13 gates, known as Darwazas.

In \\"12 Ideas for 2012\\", the Foundation is particularly in favor of the opening of marriage and adoption to same-sex couples and the selection at the entrance of the university. In June 2018, the Foundation published the results of a poll study conducted by Ipsos about youth addictions. The Foundation presented \\"worrying\\" results pertaining to the consumption levels of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, porn, and video games, as well as the usage of screens for 14-24 year-olds.

The well-preserved medieval church contains an unusual, Romanesque antependium of gilt copper of unknown origin. History and architecture Lyngsj√∂ Church was probably built during the 1140s in Romanesque style. The building material is fieldstone. From the beginning the church had a broad, western tower, a nave, choir and an apse. Originally the church ceiling was barrel vaulted but it was replaced by the presently visible Gothic vaults in the 15th century. The apse was demolished in 1796, and the entrances to the church altered. Unusually, Lyngsj√∂ Church contains a small walled-up entrance, measuring , in the northern wall. It was used by criminals who had been sentenced to death; Lynsj√∂ was between 1649 and 1750 centre of the hundred , and therefore both the location of the courthouse and the gallows serving the hundred. Convicted criminals were given the last rites in the church before being taken to be executed, but forced to use the smaller entrance to show their humility before the church. The last execution in Lyngsj√∂ was carried out in 1836. Murals The church contains fragments of medieval murals. They consist of two different sets. The oldest are possibly from the time when the church was built or from the 1190s. They were discovered during a renovation in 1953, and restored the following year. They depict religious scenes, including episodes from the life of Christ. A later mural on the wall separating the choir from the nave shows Saint Christopher. It has been dated to the 14th century. Antependium The golden antepedium of the church Arguably the most unusual thing in the church is a richly decorated, gilt antependium or altar front. It is an unusually refined piece of art, unparalleled in its kind within the Nordic countries. According to art historian and former deputy head of Kulturen Claes Wahl√∂√∂, it would be \\"better suited for the high altar of a cathedral than a countryside church\\". The antependium is made of gilt copper and contains 13 figures. The central panel displays Mary on a throne with the infant Christ in her lap. Above and below her the Old Testament kings Solomon and David are portrayed within semicircles. To the left of Mary is a portrayal of Aaron, and to her right Moses is depicted, both within circles. The other eight figures represent Prophets of Christianity. The antependium was displayed at the Baltic Exhibition in Malm√∂ in 1914. The origin of the antependium is unknown. The similarities with an antependium from the monastery of Comburg in southern Germany have been pointed out. It has been suggested that it may have been imported or perhaps manufactured locally by a goldsmith ‚Äì perhaps Italian or German ‚Äì working at the construction site of Lund Cathedral. It has been dated to between the 1150s and 1170s. Baptismal font The baptismal font, depicting Henry II of England ordering the murder of Thomas Becket Another unusual item in the church is the baptismal font. It is Romanesque in style, made of local sandstone and also dates from the end of the 12th century. The sculptor of the font has been presumed to have been the Romanesque sculptor known after a signature in another font as Tove. The richly decorated main sculptural element depicts the martyrdom of Thomas Becket. The choice of motif probably had a political significance and was not an isolated curiosity: a relic of Thomas Becket was taken to Guml√∂sa Church, also in Sk√•ne, at about the same time. The frieze running around the font displays the murder of Becket. Henry II of England is ordering the murder from his throne; to make his identity clear, the sculptor has made a little sign next to him with the inscription REX.HRICVS (interpreted as \\"King Henry\\" in Latin) A number of soldiers with drawn swords are moving towards him, and he is depicted falling down, struck by one of the soldiers. Behind him is an altar and another clerical figure with a cross; it has been interpreted as a depiction of either Edward Grim or Thomas Becket as a saint. The next scene shows Becket ascending to heaven. The rest of the sculptural decoration of the font depict traditional religious themes, such as the Coronation of the Virgin, as well as typically Romanesque grotesque beasts and imaginary animals. Other furnishings The altarpiece of the church, placed behind the altar and the antependium, is a richly decorated piece from the 17th century. The pulpit was also made 1600. The church furthermore has two church bells. The larger one is from the 13th century while the smaller one was donated to the church by a former villager who had emigrated to the United States in the 19th century. It bears the inscription √Öt Lyngby kyrka af Pehr S. Peterson, Chicago, A. D. 1889 (\\"To Lyngby sic Church from Pehr S. Peterson, Chicago, A. D. 1889\\"), and was made in New York. Holy spring About north of the church lies a spring that has been considered holy, probably since pre-Christian times. During the Middle Ages, it was associated with Saint Helena. As late as in the 18th century its waters were considered to have miraculous properties.

He was the second of four sons of a Protestant clergyman, all of whom became professional men, his brother Adair being physician to St. Thomas' Hospital, London, and professor of chemistry at Woolwich. At seventeen he entered Trinity College Dublin, and afterwards went to the Leyden University, where he graduated M. D. He then made two voyages to the East Indies as surgeon in the East India Company's service. About 1778 he was married and shortly after received an appointment as surgeon to the Naval Hospital on the Island of Barbadoes, a position of great responsibility. In 1780 a terrible hurricane devastated the island, where upon he furnished aid and medicines to the afflicted inhabitants without stint and without compensation. In 1781 he returned to England on account of bad health and during the voyage lost his wife. In 1790 he received from the Dutch government the appointment of surgeon-major to the colony of Demerara in South America; there he had charge of a military hospital of sixty to eighty beds. In 1796 he went to Baltimore. Here he helped forward the founding of the Baltimore General Dispensary, 1801; the penitentiary, 1802; the Bible Society, and the Baltimore Library. He delivered courses on natural history at the College of Medicine in 1811 and 1812, and his introductory lecture on ‚ÄúThe Cause, Seat and Cure of Diseases‚Äù is extant. He held high rank in his profession, being censor, examiner, orator, and member of the committee to publish the Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty, and consulting physician to the Board of Health and City Hospital. He was among the very first in America to use vaccine virus, which he did in the summer of 1800, a date contemporaneous with that of its use by Dr. Waterhouse, of Massachusetts, who has been given the credit of its first use in the Western Hemisphere. He wrote many medical articles of great interest and value in the medical journals of the day. What most rivets attention on John Crawford is his remarkable research into the cause of disease. As early as 1790 he conceived‚Äî entirely independently‚Äîthe idea of a living contagium‚Äîminute animalcula gaining access to the human body and there depositing germs to develop and produce disease. He ransacked the whole realm of nature and brought together a great mass of evidence to prove this theory which he maintained, notwithstanding its unpopularity and prejudice to his professional success, with all the ardor of absolute conviction. He pointed out that man, not withstanding his superior nature and possession of a soul, was subjected to the same laws as the lower animals. He enunciated the doctrine of universal parasitism. He argued convincingly from the known to the unknown, and declared prophetically that while the minute animalcula could not then be demonstrated, they are not beyond the reach of human ken and in due time would be recognized. He compares the action of the seeds of disease to the vegetable seeds‚Äîeach of which gives rise to its respective plant, and to that only. He not only held these views, but displayed his consistency by carrying them out to their legitimate conclusion‚Äîhe applied them to the prevention and treatment of disease. The bigotry and prejudices of his contemporaries compelled him to publish his opinion in a non medical periodical, The Baltimore Observer, in which they appeared in 1806 and 1807 under the heading ‚ÄúQuarantine.‚Äù We may conclude that John Crawford made an independent discovery of this theory, and so far as is known to me he is the first in all history who investigated it in a thorough and scientific manner. John Crawford died in Baltimore on May 9, 1813, after a short illness and was buried in Westminster churchyard. He was survived by one daughter, who married Maximilian Godefrey, an eminent French architect of Baltimore with whom she returned to France. Dr. Crawford's library is preserved in the University of Maryland. His articles are to be found in the American Medical Repository, the Baltimore Observer, and the Medical and Physical Recorder, Baltimore; in Schultz's History of Freemasonry in Maryland, vol. ii, 1885, and in Cordell's Medical Annals of Maryland.

It was founded 1843 and covers local news, sports, business and community events. The newspaper is published on Tuesday and Thursday. According to the American Newspaper Representatives, the newspaper has a paid circulation of 6,800 copies.  History  Originally known as the Democrat Register, it was founded on April 26, 1843 by D. W. Foster as a Whig paper. In 1845, Foster resigned, handing editorial control to Parker Purviance, a Butler, Pennsylvania attorney, who subsequently sold it to his brother-in-law A. J. Gibson. In 1852, it was purchased by Samuel Young, who changed the name to the Independent Banner in 1856. Under that name, the paper initially continued to take a Whig position, supporting Fillmore as an alternative to Buchanan in 1856, primarily on \\"Freedom for Kansas\\" grounds. Young continued to run the paper until 1869, with a brief absence after he was drafted into the Union Army in 1863. The paper opposed the Republican nominee for congress, C. W. Gilfillan, in 1869. Gilfillan bought out the paper in 1869, changing the paper's name to the Republican, thereby eliminating a major opponent in the press. Gilfillan would go on to lose the election in a close 1870 race against Democrat Samuel Griffith and would sell the paper in 1871. By 1876, the paper had a circulation of over 1,500, and was being printed on Fridays by the Republican Printing Company. J. B. Patrick took the helm in 1883, and after a long tenure as editor and publisher leased the paper to W. C. Miltenberger and W. H. Pickens in 1896. Pickens died shortly afterward, and Miltenberger bought out both his share and the publishing plant still held by Patrick. The paper continued a bitter war with political rival the Clarion Democrat, with the Democrat attacking Miltenberger's influence on \\"every paper he has ever blighted with the special brand of rot he is only capable of writing and which is supposed to be the result of an admixture of egotism and molasses on the brain.\\" In 1901, Miltenberger moved to Idaho for health reasons. When he died in 1904, he was described by the Democrat as \\"a man of most genial temperment [sic]...accommodating and obliging to a fault, being always inspired by kindly and generous sentiments.\\" After Miltenberger's 1901 departure, the role of editor and publisher was taken over by Jay E. Fitz. John P. Baker became editor of the paper in 1932 and remained with the paper until 1936. W.C. Hearst became publisher of the Clarion Republican in 1941 and later became publisher of the Clarion Democrat in 1948. In 1965, the Clarion Republican and the Clarion Democrat were purchased from W.C. Hearst by Western Pennsylvania Newspaper Company and Homer L. Watson was named publisher. The papers were combined and renamed as Clarion News.

The CBV Institute is a not-for-profit valuation professional organization that establishes the practice standards, educational requirements, and ethical guidelines for its members. The Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) or designation is a credential for business valuation professionals in Canada. CBVs are governed by The Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators. CBVs quantify the value of a business, its securities, or its intangible assets. CBVs use a variety of valuation methodologies to arrive at a conclusion, and explain their approach, methodology and conclusions in an easy to understand manner. Various approaches used include asset-based approaches (liquidation, adjusted net book value), return-based approaches (capitalized earnings, capitalized cash flows, discounted cash flows), and market-based approaches (comparable company multiples). In the context of litigation, CBVs quantify the damages or losses arising in a legal dispute. History The CBV Institute was founded in 1971 by 28 valuation professionals under the leadership of George Ovens. At the time, the introduction of taxation of capital gains in Canada facilitated the general need for business valuation. Education Requirements After completing the institute's comprehensive Program of Studies (which includes six courses dealing with business valuation, Canadian taxation, the law, and litigation support), completion of the Membership Qualification Exam (held annually), and obtaining practical experience requirements, candidates are then admitted to the membership. Students must take four courses as part of their education requirements: * Level I ‚Äì Introductory Business Valuation * Level II ‚Äì Intermediate Business Valuation * Level III ‚Äì Advanced Business Valuation * Level IV ‚Äì Special Topics in Business Valuation and pick two electives from the following: * Valuation for Financial Reporting * Litigation Support in Business Valuation * Corporate Finance * Private Investments CBVs also have continuing professional development requirements. The Institute supports this requirement by organizing various webinars, regional workshops and national conferences that address current and evolving industry topics. CBVs are required to adhere to the Standard of Professional Practice as well as its Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics. =Course Exemptions= The Institute grants various advanced standings to other organizations and university education partners: * CFA Institute: Individuals who have passed the Level I, Level II and Level III exams of the Chartered Financial Analyst Program are exempt from the requirement to complete two elective courses. * CPA Canada: students who chose \\"Finance\\" in the Professional Education Program (PEP) as an elective are exempt from Level I. * American Society of Appraisers: ASA-BV designation holders are exempt from Level I, Level II, and Level III. * University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance: Master of Accounting (MAcc) students who have taken and passed ACC606 Business Valuations are exempt from Level I and Level II.

H. F. Breckel, Radio Digest, October 4, 1924, pages 7-8.WMH was a Cincinnati, Ohio AM radio station, which was licensed to the Precision Equipment Company from December 30, 1921 to December 11, 1923, although it ceased broadcasting in early January 1923. It was the one of the first formally authorized broadcasting stations in the United States, and also the first licensed in the state of Ohio. Prior to WMH's debut, Precision had made regular broadcasts while operating under an Experimental radio station authorization. These began shortly after the World War One ban on civilian radio stations was lifted, and started as early as the fall of 1919 according to some accounts. 8XB On January 24, 1920, the Precision Equipment Company announced that \\"Radio Phone concerts\\" would be \\"starting soon\\".\\"Precision Equipment Company\\" (advertisement), Cincinnati Enquirer, January 24, 1920, page 7. As is true with most early radio stations, information about the Precision Equipment Company's earliest activities is limited. The company was founded in Cincinnati in late 1918 by Thomas E. New as the Precision Engineering Association, with the name changed to the Precision Equipment Company a short time later. The company operated a store at 2437 Gilbert Avenue, in the Peebles Corner, Walnut Hills section of Cincinnati. It sold radio parts plus a line of receivers under the \\"Ace\\" brand name, originally to a small market of amateur radio enthusiasts.\\"Pioneer Radio Broadcaster\\" (letter from Thomas E. New), Popular Electronics, November 1961, page 30. In this letter New asked about the whereabouts of Harry F. Breckel (misspelled \\"Breck\\"), apparently unaware that he had died 11 years earlier. (\\"Radio Engineer\\" (Breckel obituary), Cincinnati Enquirer, August 19, 1950, page 8.) In late 1919 or early 1920 Precision received a license to operate an Experimental radio station with the call sign 8XB.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 2, 1920, page 4. The 8 in 8XB's call sign indicated that the station was located in the eighth Radio Inspection district, and the X meant that it was operating under an Experimental license. (In 1961 New wrote 8XB's first license had been issued in September 1919, however this was a month before the U.S. government lifted the ban on civilian radio stations in place during World War One.\\"Wartime Amateur Wireless Restrictions Removed\\", The Radio Age, November 1919, page 8. An account by Harry F. Breckel stated that the station initially operated with the call sign \\"PC\\", prior to the issuance of the license for 8XB.)\\"First Broadcasting Date is Disputed\\" (Consolidated Press), Washington Evening Star, November 12, 1926, page 38. The station's vacuum-tube transmitter was constructed by New along with chief engineer Breckel, who had served as a Navy Lieutenant on the armed yacht Corsair during World War One. In November 1919 two-way voice communication was established with the government's Curtiss NC-4 airplane during its flight to Louisville, Kentucky.\\"Precision Equipment Company\\" (advertisement), Cincinnati Post, November 11, 1919, page 12. On October 31, 1920 the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company's special concert of Victor phonograph records was carried over 8XB.\\"Wurlitzer presents the new November Victor Records by Wireless Telephone\\" (advertisement), Cincinnati Enquirer, October 31, 1920, page 9. The station transmitted on a wavelength of 275 meters (1091 kHz). Breckel later reported that the inspiration for making entertainment broadcasts come from those made in the summer of 1919 during the transatlantic voyage of the SS George Washington. 8XB's initial transmitter tests primarily consisted of repeated plays of the record \\"On the 5:15\\", then, on January 24, 1920, a small newspaper advertisement announced to local amateurs that the company would shortly begin broadcasting radio concerts. On February 2nd company president John L. Gates gave the station's first publicized broadcast, consisting of phonograph records.\\"Concert Given by Wireless\\", Cincinnati Post, February 4, 1920, page 1. This garnered national attention, and a wire service report quoted Gates as predicting that nationwide broadcasts \\"will be an innovation of the near future\\".\\"Wireless Concerts\\", Chattanooga (Tennessee) News, February 5, 1920, page 6. The programming offered over 8XB gradually expanded, with a more powerful transmitter constructed in early 1920.\\"Cincinnatians Gasped in 1919 When They Heard Programs From Peebles Corner Station\\" by Lieut. Harry F. Breckel, Cincinnati Enquirer, April 13, 1924, Section 6, page 2. A June report stated that the station would provide entertainment for an outing of the Morse Mutual Benefit Association of Telegraphers at Coney Island, including broadcasting a band performance, a speech, baseball scores and other news.\\"Wireless Music\\", Cincinnati Post, June 9, 1920 page 7. At the end of October, a special program playing the latest Victor phonograph records was sponsored by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company. In early November the station made an election night broadcast, participating with Westinghouse's broadcast of returns from East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania over station 8ZZ (now KDKA),\\"Wireless Phone Test\\", Cincinnati Post, October 29, 1920, page 11. which included playing Victor records for entertainment.\\"Victor Concert by Wireless\\", Talking Machine World, November 15, 1920, page 174. In July 1921 it was reported that Breckel was presenting concerts on Monday and Wednesday nights \\"by means of a phonograph and player-piano\\".\\"Wireless Phone\\", Cincinnati Post, July 4, 1921, page 3. The following November the Baldwin Piano Company announced that it was presenting piano concerts on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday evenings in conjunction with Precision Equipment, and that \\"Hundreds of Wireless Stations within a radius of 300 miles may enjoy these concerts.\\"\\"Wireless Concert\\" (advertisement), Cincinnati Enquirer, November 20, 1921, News section, page 10. WMH Advertisement for WMH's January 23, 1922 \\"Wireless Concert\\".WMH (advertisement), Cincinnati Enquirer, January 22, 1922, News section, page 10. Initially there were no formal standards for radio stations making broadcasts for the general public, and a variety of stations, most operating under Experimental or Amateur station licenses, conducted broadcasts on a regular schedule. On December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted the first regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports.\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. On December 30, 1921, Precision Equipment received one of the new broadcasting licenses, with the randomly assigned callsign WMH, which was the first issued for the state of Ohio.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #263, issued December 30, 1921 to the Precision Equipment Company of Cincinnati, Ohio with the call letters WMH, for a one year period for operation on 360 and 485 meters. The single shared entertainment wavelength of 360 meters meant that stations within a given region had to make timesharing agreements to assign operating timeslots. As of August 7, 1922, WMH's programming ran from 8:15-10:00 p.m, while the second station licensed in Cincinnati, the Crosley Manufacturing Company's WLW, was scheduled from 1-3 p.m.\\"Radio Programs\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, August 7, 1923, page 8. During its short existence the Precision Equipment Company's most prominent customer was industrialist Powel Crosley Jr., who on February 22, 1921 visited the store, interested in buying a radio receiver for his son, only to balk at the quoted $135 price. Crosley instead purchased parts to construct his own set, which later led to his Crosley Manufacturing Company producing a line of affordable receivers. However, one important asset that Precision Equipment had which Crosley badly needed was a license to use the Armstrong regeneration circuit patent. Therefore, in early 1923 Crosley arranged to purchase Precision, which was technically the surviving entity in the resulting merger with Crosley's company, and was subsequently renamed the Crosley Radio Company.\\"Radio Companies Merged\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, January 13, 1924, page 21.Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s: Volume 1 (Crosley section) by Alan Douglas, 1988, page 110. Crosley already owned broadcasting station WLW, so following the merger operation of WMH was discontinued. The station's final broadcast took place on January 8, 1923, after which it was reported \\"its concert nights will be taken over by WLW\\".\\"Radio Plants Merge\\", Cincinnati Post, January 9, 1923, page 9. A few months later the Commerce Department reported that WMH had been reassigned to 1210 kHz,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1923, page 11. but there is no evidence that the station actually ever resumed operations, and it was formally deleted on December 11, 1923.\\"Strike out all particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 2, 1924, page 7. In early 1924, station WFBW (now WKRC), also in Cincinnati, changed its call letters to WMH, apparently as a tribute to the original WMH, however the two stations were not directly linked.\\"WFBW is Now WMH\\", Cincinnati Post, June 11, 1924, page 6. Pioneer status In 1924 Harry F. Breckel predicted that 8XB \\"will go down in history as having been the first radiocasting station conceived, designed and placed in operation for the specific purpose of radiocasting entertainment matter and the like, for the express benefit of the radio listeners of the United States\\". However, the exact date that the station began regular broadcasts is not clear. In addition, there were a number of other stations, some dating to before World War One, which made similar claims. Two of these include: * Charles \\"Doc\\" Herrold, in San Jose, California, who began test transmissions in 1909, which were followed by weekly concerts beginning in 1912.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27. * Lee de Forest's \\"Highbridge station\\" (2XG) in New York City began transmitting regularly scheduled programs beginning in late 1916.\\"Air Will Be Full of Music To-Night\\", New York Sun, November 6, 1916, page 7. These programs were suspended in April 1917 with the entry of the United States into World War I, but after the war the 2XG broadcasts resumed in late 1919. The broadcasts were again suspended in early 1920, the result of a run-in with the local Radio Inspector.Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, pages 349-351. At this point the station's transmitter was transferred to San Francisco, and relicensed as 6XC, the \\"California Theater Station\\", which around April 1920 inaugurated a wide-ranging selection of daily broadcasts. The next year de Forest wrote that this was the \\"first radio- telephone station devoted solely\\" to broadcasting to the public.\\"'Broadcasting' News by Radiotelephone\\" (letter from Lee de Forest), Electrical World, April 23, 1921, page 936.

It was built in 1932 for the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Idaho. With The house was designed by architect Charles I. Carpenter in the Colonial Revival style. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 31, 1993. The first chapter house of the Idaho Alpha chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon was at 904 Deakin, the intersection of Deakin Street and College Avenue, close to the student union building. ZXA, a newly established local fraternity, rented the boarding house in 1916 after the Gamma Phi Beta sorority moved into its newly built chapter house across from the Administration Building Lawn where the music building is now. ZXA successfully petitioned the national Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for a charter in 1919. Gems For Minerva's Crown (2019) The first SAE chapter house capacity of approximately 20 men was expanded in a 1923 remodel but toward the end of the 1920s the SAE chapter had again outgrown the building. Ibid. The goal of the local ZXA fraternity and then the SAE chapter was to be the dominant fraternity at the University of Idaho. Ibid. Searching for a location that would support this goal, the house corporation found a corner lot several blocks away at the intersection of Deakin Street and Sweet Avenue that was occupied by a two story house and a small barn. Although the lot was at the edge of campus it was considered a perfect location to build an imposing chapter house. Across Sweet Avenue was the newly planted arboretum and there were empty fields behind the property available for football and baseball games. Although Sweet Avenue was a muddy rutted dirt road, it connected to the slowly improving North South Highway that connected Moscow with Lewiston and southern Idaho. Ibid. The new SAE chapter house was designed by Spokane architect Charles I. Carpenter who also was the architect for a number of public buildings during his career that included court houses, city halls and lodge buildings in Spokane and Moscow. National Register of Historic Places. National Park Service (November 2, 2013). Carpenter chose the Colonial Revival building style for the SAE chapter house to maximize interior living space for the construction dollar. Ibid. The SAE chapter house is set diagonally on its large corner lot, facing the intersection of Deakin and Sweet streets. Because the lot drops considerably from front to rear, the full height of the basement is exposed at the rear and sides of the building but not on the facade. An asphalt driveway provides access for delivery vans and student parking at the rear. A narrower semicircular cement drive installed in the 1950s crosses the lot in front of the house. Today mature landscaping in the front includes shrubs, large spruce and birch trees. The front lawn is crossed by a concrete walkway leading from the intersection to the front door. The large chapter house was rapidly built in 4 1/2 months partly due to the ample inexpensive labor available in the Great Depression. Ibid. Architectural plans were completed in early 1932 and construction began in the spring. Contractors completed the excavation and poured footings by late May, laid the brick walls during the next two months and finished the roof before the end of July. Workmen kept on schedule allowing fraternity members to move into their new quarters before the start of the new school year in September 1932. Ibid. The 150,000 bricks used to build the SAE chapter house were produced by the Moscow Fire Brick & Clay Products in kilns located on Sweet Avenue close to the North South Highway. Gems For Minerva's Crown (2019) This Moscow company also manufactured the bricks used in many of the downtown Moscow and University of Idaho buildings built in the 1920s to 1950s. Newspaper articles reported that the fraternity's new chapter house costing $52,145 in 1932 dollars (about $990,000 in 2020 dollars) was the most expensive in the Pacific Northwest. Ibid. The 1931 lot purchase and construction the next year was financed by alumni donations, cashed in life insurance policies, undergraduate SAE's gold panning profits, sale of the 904 chapter house and the purchase of a $10,000 bond with a 2 1/2 percent interest rate by Charles Bocock (Illinois Beta 1899) a SAE alumni brother who was the president of the Albion State Normal School in Albion, Idaho. Ibid. The new four story SAE chapter house designed for 45 men was a marvel of its day. Interior space was divided by function: food, recreation, service, storage in the basement; primarily social areas on the first floor; study and sleeping areas on the second and third floors. Four load bearing brick walls support the roof and the upper two floors are supported inside the walls by an independently standing steel frame box that was designed to facilitate future remodeling. Advanced 1932 amenities included two man study rooms with built in study desks, an electric kitchen range and an electric refrigerator. There was an electric fan to cool the kitchen and dining room on hot days. Ibid. The fully exposed basement contained the boiler and nearby coal storage room, kitchen, dining room, cook's apartment and house manager's room. The basement's most private space was reserved for the chapter room. During the 1960s and later there were three basement study rooms: Room 69 (previously the cook's apartment) the Hole (the house manager's room off of the dining room) and the Mole (a small two man room off of the chapter room). Ibid. From the front the second story of the chapter house is at ground level. The front facade features a symmetrical design whose primary focus is the recessed formal center entry. Two large social rooms, the informal room on the right and the formal room on the left, flank the entry hall and a center stairwell lines up with the large front door. In 1932 the \\"Boar's Nest\\" (now called the library) was accessed through the \\"Stag Room\\" (now called the informal room) and the \\"Radio Room\\" (now called the president's room) was accessed through the formal room. Ibid. The \\"Radio Room\\" was where SAEs played ping pong and listened to music and football games on the chapter radio. For years a radio antenna was strung between the two brick chimneys to pick up radio signals. The formal room, informal room and library have brick fireplaces. At the rear of the first floor directly above the basement cook's apartment was the house mother's room which had a full bathroom and a fold down wall bed. During the 1930s and 1940s the house mother lived in the chapter house. Beginning in the 1950s the house mother's room was a facility for overnight guests such as SAE parents and served as a bathroom for dates during dances held in the chapter house. The second and third floor bathroom and shower facilities were directly above the first floor house mother's room. The two upper floors held 14 study rooms which kept their original 1932 room numbers until the 2008 rebuilding project changed the floor layouts. Articles in the 1932 Sigma Alpha Epsilon Record magazine reported that there were five sleeping dormitories in the house: two on the second floor (pledge and sophomore sleeping porches) and three more on the third floor (two large and one small dormitories). Ibid. Due to lessons learned in the 1917/1918 influenza epidemic the small dormitory was reserved as an infirmary. The University of Idaho student newspaper reported in 1932 that SAEs slept in new \\"double bunk beds with luxurious spring mattresses\\". Electric blankets to keep fraternity members warm during winter nights were not introduced to the open sleeping porches until the 1957/1958 school year. Ibid. Originally the long narrow space beneath the front entry was intended to be a bowling alley. The space soon began to be used to sight in hunting rifles for deer season and the name was changed to the \\"Shooting Gallery\\" to reflect this use. Ibid. The two lions (aka \\"Phi\\" and \\"Alpha\\") on both sides of the front entry steps were donated in 1961 by Bill Currie (Idaho Alpha 1959). The lions were acquired from a vacated bank building in the San Francisco - Oakland area. Ibid. The 1947 pledge class obtained the house bell from a closed school in the Moscow area. It was cast in 1892 in Michigan and a study room window leading out to the sophomore sleeping porch roof needed to be removed to move the bell onto the deck. The bell was cracked when it was rung all day in celebration of the 1954 football victory over Washington State. Ibid. At the beginning of the 1932 fall semester 41 SAEs moved into the new chapter house designed for 45 men. Ibid. During the 1950s chapter house capacity was expanded to 62 men by adding three and four level bunk beds on the sleeping porches converting two third floor dormitories to study rooms and increasing the number of men in most study rooms. Ibid. Minor building remodels were completed in 1968, 1978 and 1993 to refresh and update the building. A structural engineering inspection in 2002 found that the basement dining room floor, the bathrooms and others areas of the 73 year old building had deteriorated significantly. Ibid.

The reconstruction kept most of the basement and all of the first floor layout true to the 1932 architectural plans. Interior walls were taken down to the brick outside walls and then rebuilt. All heating, electrical and plumbing systems were replaced. The building was updated to current fire and access building code requirements.

Shellhammer was an admissions counselor at Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising Museum and part-time fashion and nightlife blogger. He was later a writer for JC Report, A&F; Quarterly, and The Baltimore Sun. Shellhammer is the founding editor of Queerty and worked as a freelancer at Design Within Reach. As of 2018, Shellhammer serves as eBay's chief curation and merchandising officer. Early life and education Shellhammer was born in 1976 to Peg Kendall of Pasadena, Maryland, and Richard L. Shellhamer of Baltimore. He attended high school in Anne Arundel County and went on to study at Goucher College in Towson, Maryland, where he earned a bachelor's in communications and media studies in 1998. Later, Shellhammer received an associate degree in fashion design from Parsons School of Design. Early career In 1999, Shellhammer met Jason Goldberg, with whom he would later become business partners, at Roxy NYC. Goldberg offered him the opportunity to be his assistant at his company in Silicon Valley. The two traveled to San Francisco, where Goldberg was studying at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Both were laid off four months later. Shellhammer remained in San Francisco and worked as an admissions counselor at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. Shellhammer also blogged about his experiences in fashion and nightlife. He wrote for an online magazine called JC Report where he observed and commented on fashion trends, as well as for A&F; Quarterly, and The Baltimore Sun. In August 2005, he assisted in the founding of Queerty, an online magazine about trends and lifestyle within the gay community. Shellhammer also worked part- time at Design Within Reach (DWR) as a freelancer. Between 2008 and 2009, he worked for several furniture and design stores in SoHo, Manhattan. Involvement in Fab.com and subsequent projects In 2010, Goldberg approached Shellhamer with the idea to launch Fabulis, a company that would serve as a social media network to provide travel advice and reviews to the young gay community. Shellhammer agreed to sign onto the project, and in February 2011, the company's name was shortened to Fab. During Shellhammer's tenure as chief design officer, Fab expanded rapidly and was valued at over $1 billion at its peak. By 2012, the site had over 10 million members and offered over seven million unique products. Shellhammer left the company in November 2013 and launched Shellhammer.co, a consulting company for business design, digital merchandising, and branding. He remains a stakeholder in and advisor to Fab. In 2014, Shellhammer became the chief design officer for the retailer Backcountry.com. In 2015, he founded Bezar and served as the company's chief executive officer. He later sold the company to AHAlife due to difficulty raising outside investment. In 2016, Shellhammer was brought onto the executive team at eBay to serve as chief curation and merchandising officer. Personal life Michael Lucas in 2009.alt=150x150px In March 2013, Shellhammer married partner Georgi Dimitrov Balinov, an investment banker at Barclays and a graduate of New York University.

Rohr pioneered new methods of aircraft production, including the use of drop hammers, stainless steel honeycomb construction, and overpressed forming processes which radically increased the aviation industry's overall output, critical to the Allied war effort in the Second World War. Moreover, Rohr's company was the first to sell combined engine and casing packages to major airplane manufacturers like Convair or Lockheed, which previously constructed the components in-house. Headquartered in Chula Vista, Rohr was principally responsible for the city's growth during the 20th century.  Biography  Charles Lindbergh before the Spirit of St. Louis, which Rohr worked on with a team that became known as the Night Hawks Frederick Hilmer Rohr was born on 10 May 1896 in Hoboken, New Jersey,Seracini, Debbie. Descriptive Finding Guide for Rohr Aircraft Corporation, San Diego Air & Space Museum, June 20, 2013. Accessed August 8, 2018. \\"Frederick Hilmer Rohr (born Hoboken, New Jersey, May 10, 1896; died San Diego, California, November 8, 1965) entered the aircraft industry as an independent metal parts manufacturer in 1923 and in 1925 became a general superintendent of the Prudden (later Solar) Aircraft Company for four years where he developed a punch-and-die 'drop hammer' system.\\" where his father, Henry Gustav Rohr, had recently arrived from Germany. Looking to market his skills in working with sheet metal, Henry Rohr migrated westward with his family in 1898 and founded a metalworking shop in San Francisco. Frederick Rohr grew up working in his father's shop, learning the trade while pursuing an independent engineering education through night school and correspondence courses.Dean 2017 p. 2. After serving with the U.S. Navy in the First World War, Rohr spent a few years toying with aircraft in Fresno before moving to San Diego in 1924 to open the Standard Sheet Metal Works.Jeri Gulbransen Gustafsson. They Made Chula Vista History: Fred Rohr. They Made Chula Vista History: Fred Rohr, Altrusa Club of Chula Vista, Inc. Foundation, 2011. Within a year he was hired as sheet metal foreman by the Ryan Aeronautical Company, which, after its acquisition by Frank Mahoney in 1926, was commissioned by Charles Lindbergh to build the 'Spirit of St. Louis' for his seminal transatlantic flight. Rohr not only handled all of the aircraft's sheet metal components, but engineered the specially strengthened fuel tanks required to sustain the plane's 33 1/2 hr flight through turbulent skies.Dean 2017 p. 3. In 1928, after Mahoney sold Ryan Aeronautical, Rohr became Factory Manager for the Solar Aircraft Company, where he replaced the time-consuming process of manually hammering metal sheets into desired shapes with mechanized drop hammers. This innovation, allowing workers to simply place the metal beneath a falling piston-powered cylinder, so impressed aircraft producers that Rohr was invited to introduce the machines at Boeing Airplane Company's Seattle plant, where he became a consulting engineer in 1933. He returned to San Diego two years later to take a position as Factory Manager for Ryan Aeronautical. All the while Rohr had designs upon a company of his own, inspired by his enduring faith in the future of flight. He envisioned a new type of aviation manufacturer that built neither planes nor engines, but made prefabricated aircraft components (aerostructures) for use by major airplane producers. Finally, in 1940, after months of careful consideration and planning, Rohr and four companions signed the Articles of Incorporation for the new Rohr Aircraft Corporation.Austin 1969, p. 3. With promised contracts from two major corporations and a host of poached employees from Ryan Aeronautical, Rohr wasted no time waiting for the negotiations over his planned factory plot in Chula Vista to finish; operations began downtown in a dilapidated three-story building. By October 1940 Rohr employed 64 people working on 3 significant contracts, one of which the British government had commissioned.Austin 1969 p. 4. Though the United States had not yet directly intervened in the ongoing Second World War, the government's arms agreements with Allied powers called for the sale of large quantities of military aircraft, a source of demand which ensured steady work for the nascent company. When the American government began its own military buildup, however, Rohr Aircraft Corporation underwent rapid and enormous expansion, ascending to become the largest supplier in its field.Dean 2017 p. 4. After 7 December 1941, Rohr Aircraft also took on its role as a vital part of the American war effort. The pre-constructed power plant assemblies and other aerostructures Rohr sold to airplane manufacturers increased the country's rate of plane production, as aircraft manufacturers could install such components in minutes rather than days.Mingos 1943 p.348. One year in operation had seen Rohr's new company generate $1,493,488 in revenue and hire 800 new employees.Austin 1969 p. 11. B-24 Liberator, for which Rohr provided the power package (engine and nacelle) in huge numbers during World War II Rohr relocated to the new factory grounds in 1941, but soon had to expand further and purchased new tracts. The exodus of male workers to serve in the Second World War and the company's drastic need for labor resulted in the hiring of many women, first as office staff but soon also as workers on the factory floor. Rohr manufactured power plant assemblies for Consolidated Aircraft's B-24 and PB2Y-3, nacelles for the PBY and Lockheed Hudson, and doors for the nose and landing wheels of Lockheed's P-38 fighter.Scott 2005 p. 111. Unbridled expansion continued, catapulting Rohr Aircraft to nearly 10,000 employees, but even before the war's end contracts began to slow. The Allied victory and the Truman administration's subsequent cutback on military spending blindsided the swollen company, and it burst. The high of 96,270 aircraft produced in America in 1944 fell to only 1,400 in 1946, and Rohr's workforce collapsed to 675, a decline of 93.25%.Dean 2017 p. 5. Scrambling to remain solvent, Rohr merged the Rohr Aircraft Corporation with the International Detrola Company, and his titanic industrial factories were turned from manufacturing aircraft components to making vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and toy boats. In 1949, however, after reviving a business relationship with Boeing and assisting major aircraft corporations in manufacturing techniques, Rohr bought back his company with advance payments made in good faith by Boeing executives.\\"Rohr Incorporated.\\" Funding Universe, FundingUniverse, www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/rohr-incorporated-history/. The rise of commercial aircraft and the escalation of the Cold War, especially through the Korean War, fueled Rohr Aircraft's resurgence in the 1950s, allowing for the establishment of three new manufacturing sites in Riverside, CA, Winder, GA, and Auburn, WA. Meanwhile, the workforce similarly grew, and by the end of the decade had almost completely recouped the postwar losses. However, labor relations proved a continual source of conflict, as the board of directors struggled fiercely in negotiations with the International Association of Machinists, the union which represented most Rohr employees. A strike at the Riverside plant in 1955 lasted six weeks before company officials, aided by a federal mediator, conceded the contract dispute allowing third-party arbitration of future issues. In 1960 a strike was threatened against the Riverside and Chula Vista plants, but avoided by the signing of a new contract. A 1962 labor conflict caused three employees to go on a hunger strike for seven days to protest Rohr's dilatory behavior in settling the union's contract. Employees were not the only source of discontent, however, and in 1954 Rohr's company faced severe criticism from the Citizens' League for Better Government, a newly founded Chula Vista political organization that charged Rohr with infiltrating local government in an effort to ultimately lower taxes and land lease prices. Rohr had encouraged his employees to become involved in the community and sponsored numerous donations to various charitable organizations in the area, as well as paying more than a quarter of the city's total tax revenue.Dean 2017 p. 6. Rohr employees served at all levels of the Chula Vista government, on many citizen's committees, and on school boards. Due principally to Rohr's presence, Chula Vista grew from a farming municipality of 4,000 inhabitants to a city of nearly 30,000 between 1940 and 1955. In a special election on 18 November 1954 called by the founder of the Citizens' League, a former Rohr contractor who made a failed bid for city council, three Rohr employees on the city council were unseated.Austin 1969 p. 61. The next day, Rohr issued his response, defending the company's involvement in the community and its intentions. On 25 November, all Rohr employees involved in the civil service resigned from their government positions. The Chula Vista community immediately capitulated; business owners and community leaders took out a full-page signature ad in the Chula Vista Star articulating their appreciation of the company's contribution to the city, a framed copy of which was presented to Rohr.Austin 1969 p. 63. A few weeks later, to demonstrate Rohr Aircraft's impact on Chula Vista, the workers were paid their weekly wages in silver coins from the San Francisco factory mint, which filtered through the city's homes and businesses for over a week. Frederick H. Rohr died of a stroke at the age of 69 on 8 November 1965.  Legacy  While the man and the company he started are gone, the legacy of Fred Rohr and Rohr Industries continues. The growth of Chula Vista was helped by the company, and the products it made contributed to the success of the aircraft industry from World War II into the jet age. The company provided good paying jobs for thousands of residents of Chula Vista and helped the community. Fred Rohr's contributions are recognized at Rohr Manor, Rohr Park and Rohr Elementary School, which were all named after him.https://www.chulavistaca.gov/home/showdocument?id=7573 The Chula Vista Heritage Museum hosted an exhibit showcasing Rohr's impacts on the region in 2017.

The IHRA definition, also called a Working Definition of Antisemitism, is a definition of anti-Semitism that has been adopted by a number of governmental and non- governmental organizations. The definition (which is published accompanied by illustrative examples) is: It was developed during 2003‚Äì04 and first published on 28 January 2005 on the website of the European Union agency, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). The publication was made \\"without formal review\\", and during the tenure of the EUMC the definition remained a working draft.Great Britain. Department for Communities and Local Government. All-party inquiry into antisemitism: government response, The Stationery Office, 2007, p. 3 The EUMC did not adopt the definition, and in November 2013 its successor agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), removed it from its website in \\"a clear-out of non-official documents\\". In 2016, the working definition and its list of examples was adopted by a plenary meeting of the 31 countries in the IHRA. Following its adoption by IHRA, the working definition has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions: as at June 2020, the definition has been adopted or recognize by 18 countries, including the US State Department , Germany, France, Israel, Cyprus and other European nations.Italy adopts IHRA definition of antisemitism The IHRA definition has been criticised by academics, especially on the basis that it stifles free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies.Neve Gordon, Redefining Anti-Semitism on Facebook CounterPunch 25 September 2020. Its adoption of the concept of new antisemitism, specifically connecting some criticism of Israel with antisemitism, has generated controversy. High-profile controversies took place in the United Kingdom in 2011 within the University and College Union and within the Labour Party in 2018. The definition has been contested for obstructing campaigning for the rights of Palestinians and being too vague. One of the original drafters Kenneth S. Stern has opposed the misuse of the definition to suppress and limit free speech. Background =European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia= The Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRX) (also known as the Kahn Commission) was established in 1994. The CRX was transformed into the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997 and commenced in June 1998. Its mandate was to monitor different forms of racism and xenophobia. In 2002, it published a large-scale monitoring report on Islamophobia since 9/11, including a total of 75 reports, 15 from each member state and a synthesis report. This was to be followed by a comparable report on antisemitism. A report entitled Manifestations of antisemitism in the EU 2002‚Äì2003 was published in May 2004,Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002 ‚Äì 2003 , FRA website along with a second report on perceptions of antisemitism based on interviews with European Jews.Michael Whine \\"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: Diplomatic Progress in Combating Antisemitism The antisemitism\\" Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs IV: 3 (2010) The antisemitism report was based on data collected by the 15 contact points of EUMC's monitoring network, RAXEN, then the robustness of the data evaluated by an independent researcher, Alexander Pollak. The report included a section on definitions, which concluded by proposing this definition: > \\"Any acts or attitudes that are based on the perception of a social subject > (individual, group, institution, or state) as \\"the ('deceitful', 'corrupt', > 'conspiratorial', etc.) Jew\\". The report also explored the question of when anti-Zionist or anti-Israel expression might be antisemitic (pp. 13‚Äì14) and highlighted the need to develop a common EU definition in order to collect and compare incidents across countries (pp. 25‚Äì29). In December 2003, the Centre for Research on Antisemitism (ZfA) analyzed a pre-release version of the EUMC report. The ZfA report was leaked to the press and poorly received. According to civil rights lawyer Kenneth L. Marcus, in the report the primary cause of rising antisemitism in Europe was assigned to young Muslim males, while in a press release for the subsequent final publication the EUMC assigned the rise in antisemitism to \\"young, disaffected white Europeans.\\" Marcus writes, the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism that the EUMC used was based on \\"seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness.\\" The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionism expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew. Following the EUMC report, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post WW2 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew. The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries. At the same time, according to Marcus, the EUMC, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations, scrapped its failed definition of antisemitism. =2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version= Israeli scholar Dina Porat, then head of the Stephen Roth Institute at Tel Aviv University, proposed the idea for a common definition during an NGO conference organized by the American Jewish Committee (AJC). Kenneth S. Stern of the AJC, a human rights lawyer, was critical of the EUMC's original definition, as it was confusing about when attacks on Jews related to the Israel/Palestine conflict could be considered antisemitic, and required investigators to know the intentions of attackers. Meanwhile, the EUMC asked \\"selected Jewish NGOs and academics to provide a simple working definition that would encompass antisemitic demonization of Israel, and which could also be used by their own RAXEN network of national focal points and by law enforcement agencies.\\" During 2003-04, involving the \\"efforts of a large number of institutes and individual experts\\", and coordinated by Stern, together with Dina Porat, Holocaust scholars Yehuda Bauer, Michael Berenbaum and Roni Stauber, the Community Security Trust's Michael Whine, human rights expert Felice D. Gaer, and others, a proposed definition and set of examples was drafted.Dina Porat, Defining Antisemitism, in Anti-Semitism Worldwide 2003/4, Tel Aviv University, 2005, pp. 5-17 Stern's draft working definition identified that some criticism of Israel and of Zionism are antisemitic: > Antisemitism is hatred toward Jews because they are Jews and is directed > toward the Jewish religion and Jews individually or collectively. More > recently, antisemitism has been manifested in the demonization of the State > of Israel. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm > humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for ‚Äúwhy things go wrong.‚Äù It > is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs > sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. (It may also be > manifested on people mistaken as Jews, or on non-Jews seen as sympathetic to > Jews.) This was then followed by a list of illustrative examples, including five examples of the ways in which antisemitism manifests itself with regard to the State of Israel. According to both Ken Marcus and Antony Lerman, the novel element in Stern's draft definition was identifying certain forms of criticism of Israel and Zionism as antisemitic, and Marcus also highlights the \\"praxeological\\" nature of the definition and its examples, i.e. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding. EUMC publication =Initial publication= At the suggestion of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted by Kenneth Stern; the consultation involved representatives of the AJC and European Jewish Congress, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert. The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC. Again Stern was tasked with drafting the final text. Additionally, according to Michael Whine of the Community Security Trust, \\"the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non- Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism played an active role in formulating the Working Definition.\\" On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published on its website a working definition of antisemitism which shared many features of Stern's earlier draft. Winkler published the definition \\"without formal review by her political overseers\\". Marcus writes that it was a \\"working definition\\" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership: \\"for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained.\\" The stated purpose of the definition was to \\"provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism\\", and the working definition stated: \\"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non- Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\\" The definition included the concept of collective antisemitism. Several examples relate to animus towards Israel, including both Holocaust inversion and the application of double standards to Israel. The definition states that \\"However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\\"Working definition of Antisemitism . The European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. 2004 The EUMC separated the working definition with 11 examples. This was presented as two separate groups, the first six examples were antisemitic tropes and the following five examples were introduced with the sentence: \\"Examples of the ways in which antisemitism manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context could include\\". The EUMC working definition was prominently referenced by the OSCE Cordoba conference in June that year. According to Lerman, the definition was promoted by the AJC, other American Jewish organizations, national Jewish representative bodies, Jewish defence organizations, the Israeli government, pro-Israeli-advocacy groups, and was approved by the OSCE and other pan- European organizations. According to Lerman, the EUMC working definition was widely criticized and the organization was put under pressure by supporters and critics of the definition. =Use of the EUMC definition= In 2008, the European Forum on Antisemitism commissioned translations of the Working Definition into each of the 33 languages used by the OSCE states. In 2010, Stern wrote that \\"In the last five years, the definition has been increasingly used, because it is provides a workable, non-ideological approach to task of identifying antisemitism.\\" The definition was used by monitoring agencies and law enforcement officials in some European countries. According to Stern, by 2010, the definition had > been referenced or relied upon in or by courts (in Lithuanian and Germany), > congressional hearings in the United States, online reference tools, > newspapers, blogs, scholarly articles, legal articles, radio shows, student > groups, museums, national inquiries of parliamentarians (most importantly in > the UK), international meetings of parliamentarians, United States > Department of State Reports, The United States Commission on Civil Rights, > and in submissions to the United Nations Economic and Social Council > Commission on Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection > of Human Rights... It continues to be referenced more and more because of > its clear utility. For example, in Lithuania, it was referred to in a successful criminal case against an editor of a right-wing newspaper in 2005.Decision, Vilnius District 2 Court, Judge A. Cinnas, #A11-01087-497/2005, 7 July 2005. Cited in Porat, Dina, \\"Defining Antisemitism,\\" Stephen Roth Institute, and Stern, Kenneth, \\"The Working Definition ‚Äì A Reappraisal\\" The Working Definition of Antisemitism ‚Äì Six Years After , p.3 The definition was used to some extent by some intergovernmental and EU agencies. For example, the OSCE used the definition in a 2005 report Education on the Holocaust and Antisemitism: An Overview and Analysis of Educational Approaches. By 2010 it was recommended in the course leaders‚Äô Facilitators Guide in the OSCE OHDIR programme to assist law enforcement officials to understand and investigate hate crime, and at the 2010 OSCE High Level Conference on Tolerance and Non-Discrimination in Astana urged participating states to use and promote the Working Definition. In February 2009, the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism conference, in the London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism, issued a call to governments to expand the use of the Working Definition. Canadian Members of Parliament adopted a resolution to combat antisemitism in 2007 that cited the definition, and the Australian Online Hate Prevention Institute.R. Amy Elman Sidestepping Lethal Antisemitism ‚Äì The EU's Response in the Aftermath of Terror, March 2015 The definition is used by the Justice Ministers of Austria and Germany in training prosecutors and judges. It was also adopted formally by other governmental and non-governmental organizations in some countries. United Kingdom In 2006, the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism recommended that the UK adopt the definition and that it be promoted by the Government and law enforcement agencies. The Government Response the following year recognised the \\"useful work being done by the EUMC in identifying antisemitic discourse\\", noted that the government accepted the definition of racism in the MacPherson Report on institutional racism and that this subsumed the EUMC and went further. It also noted that \\"from the EUMC's evidence to the Committee\\", the \\"definition is in fact a work in progress and has not been recommended to states for adoption\\". However, it undertook to re- examine this if the EUMC's successor body, the FRA, did recommend it for adoption, an undertaking it repeated the following year in its progress report on implementing the Inquiry's recommendations, noting this had been delayed by the process of transforming into the FRA delayed this.All-Party Inquiry into Antisemitism: Government Response ‚Äì One year on Progress Report, p. 6, Cm 7351, 12 May 2008 In 2009, the leaders of the Labour and Conservative parties signed the London Declaration endorsing the definition. The National Union of Students formally adopted the Working Definition at its 2007 Conference. Some individual students unions followed suit, although at others motions to do so were defeated. In 2011, the University and College Union passed a resolution opposing the use of the definition, which led to the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews describing the union as \\"institutionally antisemitic\\". On 1 January 2015, Professor David Feldman stated in a Sub- Report for the Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism that the definition had \\"largely has fallen out of favour\\" due to criticisms received.Professor David Feldman, Sub-Report for the Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism , 1 January 2015, page 4: \\"However, the definition itself rapidly became a topic of controversy rather than consensus. The points at issue included what the status of a 'working definition' actually was, whether the working definition was an effective and coherent definition at all, and, finally, controversy dogged the application of the working definition to debate on the State of Israel and its policies. The criticisms have been damaging and the EUMC working definition largely has fallen out of favour.\\"House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, Antisemitism in the UK, Tenth Report of Session 2016‚Äì17 , 16 October 2016 United States The United States Commission on Civil Rights, after investigating campus antisemitism, adopted the definition, to help universities identify the lines between hateful and non-hateful incidents. In 2007, the EUMC definition was adopted as \\"an initial guide\\" by the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism within the U.S. Department of State, stating that it \\"should not be construed... as United States policy\\".Fact Sheet, Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, Washington, DC, February 8, 2007, \\"Working Definition\\" of Anti-Semitism : \\"In light of the longstanding commitment of the U.S. to free speech and other individual freedoms as demonstrated within our Constitution, the Office of the Special Envoy believes that this definition provides an adequate initial guide by which anti-Semitism can eventually both be defined and combated, and therefore presents this \\"working definition\\" as a starting point in the fight against anti-Semitism. [Footnote: The recitation of the EUMC \\"working definition\\" of anti-Semitism should not be construed as an acceptance of that definition, or the statements and examples thereunder, as United States policy.]\\" In 2008, the State Department again endorsed the Working Definition in their Contemporary Global Antisemitism report to Congress, noting that \\"a widely accepted definition of antisemitism can be useful in setting the parameters of the issue. Such a definition also helps to identify the statistics that are needed and focuses attention on the issues that policy initiatives should address‚Ä¶.The EUMC‚Äôs working definition provides a useful framework for identifying and understanding the problem and is adopted for the purposes of this report.\\" In June 2010 the State Department adopted a definition based on the EUMC definition.Defining Anti-Semitism , 8 June 2010 It used exactly the same headline definition as the EUMC definition, but made various modifications to the examples, to incorporate Israeli politician Natan Sharansky's 3D Test of Antisemitism. According to Marcus, while it was in effect the State Department definition was more important in determining U.S. government foreign policy than the EUMC definition since it represented an official policy position. In 2011, the AJC's Ken Stern and Cary Nelson, President of the American Association of University Professors published a letter stating that \\"It is a perversion of the definition to use it, as some are doing, in an attempt to censor what a professor, student, or speaker can say\\"; this generated significant controversy within the American Jewish community. The State Department has since adopted the IHRA definition.State Department Resources : \\"As a member of IHRA, the United States now uses this working definition and has encouraged other governments and international organizations to use it as well.\\" On 12 January 2016, Peter Roskam and Tim Scott introduced a bipartisan bill in the House and Senate on combating antisemitism on campus, under the title of The Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, to codify the working definition. It would require the US Department of Education to refer to the definition in deciding if educational institutions had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by tolerating antisemitic harassment. It was passed in the Senate, and on 22 December 2016 it was referred to the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. and This hearing was held on 7 November 2017; it \\"took a heated turn\\" as four of the nine witnesses argued that the definition infringes on freedom of speech regarding Israel. On 23 May 2018, the same bills were reintroduced with minor amendments. On 24 July 2018 they were referred again to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. and The Bill was criticised as an attack on free speech. =FRA removal= The EUMC never granted any official status to the definition. In 2007, the EU replaced the EUMC with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), with a broader remit than racism and antisemitism. It has continued to deliver annual reports of antisemitic incidents in the EU countries, based on data from its national contact points.Michael Whine Improving Legal and Other Protections for Europe‚Äôs Jews\\" in JUSTICE The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, No.59, pp.7-12 The FRA told Richard Kuper that: \\"Since its development we are not aware of any public authority in the EU that applies it [and the] FRA has no plans for any further development.\\" In an August 2010 publication on antisemitism, the FRA did not mention the working definition. /Following on from the EUMC's 2004 report, the FRA's 2012 report on antisemitism equates New antisemitism with anti-Zionism. FRA also used the term secondary antisemitism to define similar phenomenon in relation to the Holocaust. In 2013, the FRA confirmed that it did not have the authority to \\"either set or repudiate any definitions\\" of antisemitism. In November 2013, the FRA removed the definition from its website in \\"a clear-out of non- official documents\\"; a spokesperson stated at the time that \\"We are not aware of any official definition [of anti-Semitism]\\".EU anti-racism agency unable to define anti-Semitism, official says , JTA, 4 December 2013 In April 2016, Middle East Monitor reported that, in response to a motion passed at the UK National Union of Students annual conference endorsing the definition, the FRA stated that the working definition ‚Äúis not an official EU definition and has not been adopted by FRA‚Äù. IHRA publication On 26 May 2016, IHRA adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism. The IHRA adoption took place following the efforts of Mark Weitzman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, at the Bucharest plenary meeting of the IHRA on 30 May 2016, where its 31 member countries voted to adopt it. Mark Weitzman later told a workshop that the definition was copied from the EUMC version as there was \\"not enough time to invent a new one\\".OSCE, Seminar: Turning words into action to address anti- Semitism, intolerance and discrimination , 16‚Äì17 June 2016, European Parliament, Brussels, p.12: \\"Mr. Weitzman then provided the background to the adoption of the working definition on anti-Semitism during the IHRA Plenary meeting held in Bucharest on 26 May 2016. He explained that the definition is taken from the EUMC definition as there was not enough time to invent a new one.\\" The decision to adopt the text was based on consensus amongst IHRA's 31 member countries. IHRA's 38-word basic \\"working definition\\" of antisemitism reads: Accompanying the definition, to \\"guide IHRA in its work,\\" the IHRA has written eleven contemporary examples which \\"may serve as illustrations\\". Some of the examples explain that criticising Israel can stray into antisemitic discourse. In particular, it states that, \\"taking into account the overall context\\", examples could include \\"Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations\\" and \\"claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor\\" (and nine other examples). Antony Lerman notes that the EUMC and IHRA definitions are set out differently. The EUMC 38-word working definition is distinguished from the rest of the text by being set in bold type. The same text in the IHRA definition is not only also in bold type, it's enclosed in a box which contains the longer part of a prefatory sentence that begins outside the box. The European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine states that on 12 September 2017 the IHRA Permanent Office in Berlin replied to their inquiry thusly. \\"[‚Ä¶] The Plenary of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted the working definition of antisemitism under the Romanian Chairmanship on 26 May 2016. The working definition, like all IHRA decision, is non-legally binding. The working definition is the text in the box‚Ä¶\\"http://www.eccpalestine.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/12/Fact-Sheet_IHRA-Definition-Antisemitism_ECCPFSOI.pdf Lerman argues that this confirmed that the definition and the examples were separate things. Adoption In late 2016, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe considered adopting the definition; the adoption was blocked by Russia.Israeli Envoy Raps Russia , Times of Israel: \\"Koren's statement came as confirmation to reports, including by the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jonathan Arkush, that Russia was the only country blocking the adoption of the definition, which is controversial because it lists some forms of hate speech on Israel as an example of anti- Semitism.\\" Following its adoption by IHRA, the working definition has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. By 2018, according to Lerman, the working definition had been formally adopted by six of the 31 governments whose countries are members of IHRA had formally endorsed or adopted the definition. The countries adopting the IHRA definition also appoint a national coordinator for the fight against antisemitism. The United Kingdom (12 December 2016) was the first country to adopted the definition, followed by Israel (22 January 2017), Austria (25 April 2017), Scotland (27 April 2017), Romania (25 May 2017), Canada (23 August 2017), and Germany (20 September 2017) In October 2017, Bulgaria adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism and appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev as national co-ordinator for the fight against antisemitism.Bulgaria appoints national coordinator for fight against antisemitism The European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution calling for member states to adopt the definition on 1 June 2017 \\\\- although Lerman notes that this is without explicitly quoting the examples. As of 29 March 2019, Lithuania (24 January 2018), Moldova (20 January 2019), and North Macedonia have also adopted the definition. In November 2019, Greek Prime Minister announced that Greece was set to adopt the IHRA‚Äôs definition of antisemitism.Greece to officially adopt broad definition of anti-Semitism On 5 December 2019, France‚Äôs National Assembly called on the government to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism.French parliament decides anti-Zionism is antisemitism In December 2020, it was adopted by Cyprus, the seventeenth country to do so according to the Jerusalem Post. The Cypriot Cabinet approved a proposal to adopt the non-legally binding, working definition of anti-semitism, as employed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, as a useful guidance tool in education and training.Cabinet approves anti-semitism definition In January 2020, Italy adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism without its examples and appointed Professor Milena Santerini as national coordinator against antisemitism.Italy adopts IHRA definition of antisemitism In June 2020, it was adopted by Serbiahttps://www.jpost.com/breaking- news/serbia-adopts-ihra-definition-of-antisemitism-630192 Serbia adopts IHRA definition of antisemitism and Argentina adopted it.Argentina adopts IHRA definition of anti-Semitism In addition, at a sub-national or institutional level, the state of South Carolina, the United States Department of Education, the city of Bal Harbour in Florida, the Greek Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs, and Western Washington University have adopted it. Israel‚Äôs Minister of Strategic Affairs wrote an op-ed in Newsweek in July 2020 calling for social media companies to fully adopt the working definition, and the following month 120 organizations, led by StopAntisemitism.org, which is funded by philanthropist Adam Milstein, sent a letter to Facebook‚Äôs Board of Directors, calling upon them to fully adopt the IHRA definition as the ‚Äúcornerstone of Facebook‚Äôs hate speech policy regarding antisemitism.‚Äù According to Neve Gordon, Facebook responded by saying its definition ‚Äúdraws on the spirit‚Äîand the text‚Äîof the IHRA\\" but demonstrated reluctance to adopt the examples that relate to Israel, and critics of the definition also lobbied the company not to adopt it. =United Kingdom= In March 2016, the UK government published a short article on defining antisemitism, authored by Eric Pickles, then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which stated \\"for those seeking a definition of antisemitism, the UK‚Äôs College of Policing does include a working definition of antisemitism [i.e. the EUMC working definition] in their guidance to police forces in the UK\\", which was then quoted in full in the article, this definition was the EUMC working definition.\\"A definition of antisemitism\\" Published 30 March 2016 Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles. The article cites Hate Crime Operational Guidance College of Policing 2014, section 3.2.3 pp.35-28 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons Home Affairs Select Committee reported on antisemitism in the UK. Its report included a long section on defining antisemitism, including a discussion of the working definition, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the definition as \\"helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose‚Äù, as well as a summary of some criticisms of the definition. Among the Committee's recommendations were \\"that the IHRA definition, with our additional caveats, should be formally adopted by the UK Government, law enforcement agencies and all political parties, to assist them in determining whether or not an incident or discourse can be regarded as antisemitic.\\"Home Affairs Committee 10th Report - Antisemitism in the UK, October 2016. Cf report, oral and written evidence and government response on the HAC website. The caveats were two additional clarifications designed to protect freedom of speech in discussion of Israel/Palestine: > It is not antisemitic to criticise the Government of Israel, without > additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent. It is not antisemitic to > hold the Israeli Government to the same standards as other liberal > democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli Government‚Äôs > policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic > intent. In December 2016, the UK government responded that it had agreed to adopt the IHRA definition, but that the caveats were unnecessary given the definition's clause ‚Äúcriticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic‚Äù is sufficient to ensure freedom of speech. The government also noted that the police already used a previous version of the definition (the EUMC version) and that it \\"is a useful tool for criminal justice agencies and other public bodies to use to understand how anti- Semitism manifests itself in the 21st century\\".Government Response to Home Affairs Committee Report: ‚ÄòAnti-Semitism in the UK‚Äô. Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government by Command of Her Majesty December 2016 Later that month, the government announced it would formally adopt the definition. Subsequently, the definition has been adopted by some 120 UK municipalities and by the London Assembly and the Mayor of London.Mayor of London: Definition of Antisemitism Wednesday 8 February 2017Mayor of London's Question Time, 10 August 2017, Question 2017/3115 \\"I am therefore pleased to confirm that I have adopted the IHRA's working definition\\" In July 2018, an Early Day Motion was proposed by Labour Party MP Luciana Berger and signed by 39 mainly Labour MPs welcomed the UK's formal adoption of the definition and noted that the Welsh and Scottish Governments, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, London Assembly, and over 120 local councils had formally adopted the definition. It has also been adopted by religious and educational institutions such as the Church of Scotland and King's College London. However, in 2017 a resolution to the University and College Union called for the union to formally reject the definition. In August 2019, Tower Hamlets London Borough Council refused to host the fifth annual charity bike ride event in aid of Palestinian children in Gaza called BigRide4Palestine due to concerns that criticism of Israel would violate the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. Antony Lerman concluded that the working definition was an obstacle to constructive criticism of Israel. Twenty three signatories of an open letter to The Guardian stated that the council's refusal to host the charity event has vindicated concerns raised about the working definition and that it \\"demonstrates that freedom of expression on Palestine in this country is now being suppressed\\". The signatories included Geoffrey Bindman, Lindsey German, Nadia Hijab, Kate Hudson, Dr Ghada Karmi, Mike Leigh, Jenny Manson, Kika Markham, Karma Nabulsi, Clare Short, Norman Warner and Mark Serwotka. In September 2019, Robert Jenrick, the newly appointed Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government said \\"I will use my position as Secretary of State to write to all universities and local authorities to insist that they adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition of Antisemitismdefinition at the earliest opportunity...and use it when considering matters such as disciplinary procedures. Failure to act in this regard is unacceptable.\\" Labour Party In December 2016, Labour adopted the working definition. It was formally accepted at the 2017 Labour Party Conference. In July 2018, the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted without a vote a definition of antisemitism based on the IHRA definition, although it removed or amended four out of eleven examples of what allegedly constitutes antisemitism, added an additional three examples and amended points showing how criticising Israel can be antisemitic. Labour said the wording in the code of conduct \\"expands on and contextualises\\" the IHRA examples. The Shadow Solicitor-General, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said many of IHRA's examples were \\"adopted word for word in our code of conduct\\" while \\"the ground is covered\\" for others. He said: \\"We should be going further than the IHRA definition and the language of the code is at times much stronger. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to.\\" The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism,Jeremy Corbyn Labour Definition Antisemitism , The Jewish Chronicle leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community. A statement by the UK Delegation to the IHRA stated that \\"Any 'modified' version of the IHRA definition that does not include all of its 11 examples is no longer the IHRA definition. Adding or removing language undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist. If one organization or institution can amend the wording to suit its own needs, then logically anyone else could do the same. We would once again revert to a world where antisemitism goes unaddressed simply because different entities cannot agree on what it is.\\"IHRA Warns Labour against undermining its antisemitism definition , The Jewish Chronicle In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 IHRA examples (unamended) to the definition of antisemitism. A few days later the Parliamentary Labour Party voted by a majority of 205 to adopt the unamended definition to their standing orders. Later in the month, a report by the Media Reform Coalition examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. The research found evidence of \\"overwhelming source imbalance\\" in which critics of Labour's code of conduct dominated coverage which failed to include quotes from those defending the code, critiquing the IHRA working definition and key contextual facts about the IHRA working definition. Other political parties In July 2018, the Conservative Party claimed it had adopted the definition in full. However, at the time their code of conduct approved in December 2017, which only governs the behavior of anyone representing the Party as an elected or appointed official or office-holder, did not mention antisemitism or specify a definition of it. Since then their code has been amended to include an interpretive annexe on discrimination, which does refer to the IHRA definition and says it was adopted in December 2016 (the date the Conservative government adopted the definition). In September 2018, The Liberal Democrats formally adopted the IHRA definition with the working examples. In October 2018, Green Party of England and Wales did not adopt the definition. Their home affairs spokesman and former deputy leader, Shahrar Ali, told their annual conference the definition was \\"politically engineered to restrict criticism of Israel's heinous crimes upon the Palestinian people\\". In September 2019, Robert Jenrick, the newly appointed Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, who is a member of the Parliamentary Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI) group, said \\"I will use my position as Secretary of State to write to all universities and local authorities to insist that they adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition of Antisemitismdefinition at the earliest opportunity...and use it when considering matters such as disciplinary procedures. Failure to act in this regard is unacceptable.\\" Criticism =Comparing With Nazi Germany= In 2009, sociologist Paul Igansky states that parallels between Israeli policy and those of the Nazis are \\"arguably not intrinsically antisemitic\\", and that the context in which they are made is critical,Igansky, Paul, \\"Conceptualizing Anti-Jewish Hate Crime\\", in Hate Crimes, Barbara A. Perry (Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009, pp 114-115 although sociologist David Hirsh accuses anti-Zionists of double standards in their criticism of Israel, and notes that other states carry out policies similar to those of Israel without those policies being described as \\"Nazi\\".Hirsh, David. 2007. Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism: Cosmopolitan Reflections. Working Paper. Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism (YIISA) Occasional Papers, New Haven, CT. =Academic= In March 2005, Brian Klug argued that this definition proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring criticism of Israel, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews. In December 2016, David Feldman wrote: \\"I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry.\\" He also said: \\"The text also carries dangers. It trails a list of 11 examples. Seven deal with criticism of Israel. Some of the points are sensible, some are not.\\" He added: \\"Crucially, there is a danger that the overall effect will place the onus on Israel's critics to demonstrate they are not antisemitic.\\" In February 2017, a letter signed by 243 British academics, who asserted that the \\"violation of the rights of Palestinians for more than 50 years\\" should not be silenced, contends \\"this definition seeks to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism\\" and raised concerns about muddying the definition of anti-Semitism and restricting free debate on Israel. In July 2018, Antony Lerman wrote: \\"investing all in the IHRA working definition of antisemitism is just making matters worse. This is the time to take the path to working with other minority groups, civil society organizations and human rights bodies to confront antisemitism within the context of a wider antiracist struggle, not to perpetuate the notion that Jews stand alone.\\" He later stated that \\"the case against IHRA is so strong\\" and \\"...the fundamental principle that IHRA is so flawed it should be abandoned...\\" In August 2019, he wrote: \\"The vagueness of the 'working definition' of antisemitism has licensed a free-for-all of interpretation, delighting opponents of Palestinian demands for equal rights.\\" In the same month, Klug wrote: \\"...critics maintain that Labour (or anyone else) has to adopt the IHRA document 'in full'. But the text is not written in stone. It is a working definition with working examples. It is a living document, subject to revision and constantly needing to be adapted to the different contexts in which people apply its definition... But people of goodwill who genuinely want to solve the conundrum ‚Äì combating antisemitism while protecting free political speech ‚Äì should welcome the code as a constructive initiative, and criticise it constructively... For this to happen, the seas of language are going to have to subside and critics must stop treating the IHRA document as immutable. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA.\\" In August 2018, Rebecca Ruth Gould, Professor of Islamic world and comparative literature at the University of Birmingham published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech. Gould described \\"the IHRA definition as a quasi-law\\" and documents the meaning of the IHRA document's self-description as \\"legally non-binding,\\" the history of its application, and the legal dynamics bearing on its deployment in university contexts. In November, Gould stated that \\"These dimensions are made all the more contentious by its imprecise content and the significant ambiguity around its legal status. On the basis of the many ways in which the IHRA definition has been used to censor speech, particularly on university campuses\\" and \\"that the definition's proponents have not paid enough attention to the harms of censoring Israel-critical speech.\\" She also noted that since the adoption of the IHRA definition: \\"at least five universities [in the UK], and likely many more, have had planned events cancelled or otherwise censored due to a perceived need to comply with this definition, even in the absence of its legal ratification.\\" In autumn 2018, antisemitism expert Michael Whine wrote in Justice, the legal magazine of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, that the IHRA definition was never intended to be \\"a binding legal act.\\" In July 2019, Geoffrey Alderman wrote: \\"those who framed the IHRA's Working Definition of antisemitism were well-intentioned, and the definition itself has commendable features. But it's merely a work-in- progress.\\" He later wrote \\"...endorsements have endowed the IHRA definition with almost sacrosanct status. But that does not mean that it is either perfect or even fit for purpose. It is ‚Äì in fact ‚Äì neither\\" and that it is \\"deeply-flawed and much misunderstood\\". =Legal= In March 2017, human rights lawyer Hugh Tomlinson QC criticised the IHRA definition as \\"unclear and confusing\\", saying it did not have \\"the clarity which would be required\\" from a legal definition of antisemitism.\\" He addressed concerns that the definition conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel and could be misused to curtail campaigning on behalf of Palestinians. He stated: \\"Properly understood in its own terms the IHRA Definition does not mean that activities such as describing Israel as a state enacting a policy of apartheid, as practising settler colonialism or calling for policies of boycott divestment or sanctions against Israel can properly be characterized as antisemitic. A public authority which sought to apply the IHRA Definition to prohibit or sanction such activities would be acting unlawfully.\\" He presented his legal opinion on the new working definition at the House of Lords. In May 2017, former Court of Appeal judge Stephen Sedley said: \\"Shorn of philosophical and political refinements, anti-Semitism is hostility towards Jews as Jews. Where it manifests itself in discriminatory acts or inflammatory speech it is generally illegal, lying beyond the bounds of freedom of speech and of action. By contrast, criticism (and equally defence) of Israel or of Zionism is not only generally lawful: it is affirmatively protected by law. Endeavours to conflate the two by characterising everything other than anodyne criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic are not new. What is new is the adoption by the UK government (and the Labour Party) of a definition of anti-Semitism which endorses the conflation.\\" In July 2018, Sedley wrote: \\"...Sir William Macpherson did not advise that everything perceived as racist was ipso facto racist. He advised that reported incidents that were perceived by the victim as racist should be recorded and investigated as such. His purpose was to reverse the dismissive culture that characterised the reporting and policing of racial incidents. To derive from this fallacy a proposition that anything perceived by one or more Jewish people as antisemitic is legally an act of racism is not only absurd: it overlooks another aspect of legality, the right of free expression contained in article 10 of the European convention on human rights and now embodied in our law by the Human Rights Act. It is a right that may be qualified by proportionate legal restrictions necessary for protecting the rights of others: hence the legal bar on hate speech.\\" Regarding the examples he said: \\"They point to the underlying purpose of the text: to neutralise serious criticism of Israel by stigmatising it as a form of antisemitism.\\" In July 2018, human rights solicitor Geoffrey Bindman wrote: \\"Unfortunately, the definition and the examples are poorly drafted, misleading, and in practice have led to the suppression of legitimate debate and freedom of expression. Nevertheless, clumsily worded as it is, the definition does describe the essence of antisemitism: irrational hostility towards Jews. The 11 examples are another matter. Seven of them refer to the state of Israel. This is where the problem arises. Some of them at least are not necessarily antisemitic. Whether they are or not depends on the context and on additional evidence of antisemitic intent.\\" In August 2018, Geoffrey Robertson QC, an expert on freedom of speech and human rights, said that the working definition fails to cover the most insidious forms of hostility to Jewish people. He said that several of the examples are so loosely drafted that they are likely to chill free speech, legitimate criticisms of the Israeli Government and coverage of human rights abuses against Palestinians. He said the definition was not intended to be binding and was not drafted as a comprehensible definition the British government's adoption of the working definition \\"has no legal effect\\" and recommended that any public bodies or organizations should follow the Home Affairs Committee recommendation and add to it the clarification that \\"it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Government of Israel without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.\\" He concluded that \\"It is imprecise, confusing and open to misinterpretation and even manipulation... is not fit for any purpose that seeks to use it as an adjudicative standard\\" and political action against Israel is not properly characterised as antisemitic unless the action is intended to promote hatred or hostility against Jews in general. =Original drafter= In 2004, as the American Jewish Committee's antisemitism expert, Kenneth S. Stern was the lead drafter of the working definition and its examples. He cautioned against the free speech implications of its use as a legal tool. He has opposed efforts to enshrine it in legislation and wrote a letter to members of the US Congress warning that giving the definition legal status would be \\"unconstitutional and unwise\\" in December 2016. In 2011, he co-authored an article about how the 'Working Definition' was being abused in Title VI cases, because it was being employed in an attempt to \\"restrict academic freedom and punish political speech.\\" In November 2017, Stern explained to the US House of Representatives that the definition has been abused on various US university campuses. He warned that it could \\"restrict academic freedom and punish political speech\\" and questioned whether definitions created by minority groups should be legislatively enshrined, giving as one of several examples. > \\"Imagine a definition designed for Palestinians. If \\"Denying the Jewish > people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to > exist\\" is antisemitism, then shouldn't \\"Denying the Palestinian people their > right to self-determination, and denying Palestine the right to exist\\" be > anti-Palestinianism? Would they then ask administrators to police and > possibly punish campus events by pro-Israel groups who oppose the two state > solution, or claim the Palestinian people are a myth?\\" He states that the definition was created \\"as a tool for data collectors in European countries to identify what to include and exclude from their reports about antisemitism, and to have a common frame of reference so that data might be compared across borders.\\" He \\"encouraged the Department of State's first Special Envoy for Antisemitism to promote the definition as an important tool.\\" He used it effectively as the framework for a report on global antisemitism. He added: \\"approaches to antisemitism that endorse and promote academic freedom are more likely to work, in part because they underscore the academy's goal of increasing knowledge and promoting critical thinking.... approaches that explain academic freedom away or harm it will not only fail, they make the problem worse.\\" In December 2019, Stern said: \\"It was created primarily so that European data collectors could know what to include and exclude. That way antisemitism could be monitored better over time and across borders. It was never intended to be a campus hate speech code...\\" =Organizations= In August 2017, Jewish Voice for Labour (JVL) saw the working definition as \\"attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews\\". In August 2018, JVL thought the IHRA examples of antisemitism fell short of providing \\"a clear and unambiguous statement based on attitudes to Jews as Jews, not attitudes to a country, Israel\\". In December 2017, the Board of Deputies of British Jews wrote that \\"there is a worrying resistance from universities to adopting it and free speech is given as the primary reason for their reluctance. It is said to be 'contentious' because some people argue that current concerns surrounding antisemitism are motivated by ulterior motives, namely defending the policies of the Israeli government. We would suggest that if a definition of prejudice against any other community referenced arguments that their concerns were even partially guided by ulterior motives then that community would infer that the definition did not take prejudice and discrimination against their group seriously. It is also not an assault on free speech to say that students or staff should not be indulging antisemitic tropes. Rather, it is part of what makes a healthy society.\\" In May 2018, the members' conference of the British civil liberties advocacy group Liberty passed a motion resolving that the definition could constitute a threat to freedom of expression by \\"conflating anti-semitism with criticism of Israel and legitimate defence of the rights of Palestinians.\\"Resolutions Passed , Liberty, May 2018 In July 2018, a statement signed by 39 left-wing Jewish organizations in 15 countries, including six based in the UK, was released criticising the working definition, declaring that it was \\"worded in such a way as to be easily adopted or considered by western governments to intentionally equate legitimate criticisms of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian rights with antisemitism, as a means to suppress the former\\" and that \\"this conflation undermines both the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality and the global struggle against antisemitism. It also serves to shield Israel from being held accountable to universal standards of human rights and international law.\\" The statement went on to urge governments, municipalities, universities and other institutions to reject the IHRA definition.Chernick, Ilanit (18 July 2018). \\"39 Jewish left- wing groups pen letter supporting BDS\\" The Jerusalem Post.

Early life and education She received a B.A. from Scripps College. She completed the Eddie Adams Workshop in 2009. In 2014. she received an M.A. in photojournalism from the University of the Arts, London, U.K. Panich- Linsman, graduated from the International Center of Photography's photojournalism program. Major works Panich-Linsman feels that photojournalists are drawn to documentary subjects for a reason. In general, the stories she shoots are stories that she particularly cares about. \\"I‚Äôm interested in women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs issues, immigration and healthcare.\\" These interests have been the motivation for several of her major projects. Supported by a Rita K. Hillman Foundation grant she reported on children in a pediatric palliative care unit and their parents. > This particular project gave me an opportunity to begin to understand what > it is like for a family to support a critically ill child, and for a > palliative-care team to support that family. Perhaps it is a way to face my > own fears. Curious about cultural differences when a girl begins to define herself as a woman, she followed this idea from Brooklyn to Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. She juxtaposed two sets of photographs, one from Brooklyn and one from the Mideast, and, found remarkable similarities. Long fascinated with the child beauty-pageant industry, she was interested in learning more about the motivations of the parents and the child, as well as the idea of western beauty ideals. Panich-Linsman explores this coming-of-age theme in rural Westfield, Massachusetts, where 12-year-old Emily and her mom spend more time at beauty salons than at parties. The result was the photo series, \\"The Tree and the Apple\\" Panich-Linsman reported on the plight of Central American families attempting to immigrate to the U.S. for the New York Times. \\"With their belongings close and their children closer,\\" with video and photographs, she documented the scene at a McAllen, Texas, bus station, which was described as America's new Ellis Island. Panich-Linsman took frame by frame photos of the migrants waiting in line, to develop a panoramic image. The Times felt this was critical to the story, emphazing to the readers that the migrants are real people. According to the New York Times reporter discussing the article: \\"What makes this story stand out is the visual focus on the migrants, some who risked their lives to stand in line at that bus station.\\" Panich-Linsman also conducted on-the-fly interviews with migrants in 105-degree heat about the next phase in their lives. Panich-Linsman has worked at the border extensively since moving to Texas in 2014. Other works from south Texas include features about a female mariachi band, girls growing up in a border town and difficulties for children with transgender identity. Border cities like those in the Rio Grande Valley have been the subject of increased national coverage since President Trump‚Äôs election. Since the start of 2019, in hopes they might better learn about, and from, the people who make their homes there, The New York Times has assigned Ilana Panich-Linsman to live and work in McAllen, Texas.

Versions for the Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, and ZX Spectrum, were cancelled. Plot An alien race of arachnoids are invading various planets around the galaxy. The only protection the planets have are planetary forcefields, which require frequent recharging. A team of elite insectoid warriors mounted on runner creatures are assigned to do the job of maintaining the forcefields before penetration occurs. Gameplay The main objective is to traverse across the planet to find the forcefield generators to recharge them. Throughout the game, the player will have numerous hostile forces to shoot down in multiple directions. The player can either control the insectoid character on foot or on its mount. Being on a mount allows faster travel around the planet, although the mount can take limited hits from enemies, before it dies, though a spare one can be summoned. The player has limited time to recharge the generators, has a limited number of spare mounts, and has limited energy, which depletes when an enemy or projectile hits the insectoid. A radar on the top menu indicates which generators need to be maintained. When a generator is found, the player must dismount and use a special tool to power it up. When all generators are maintained, the player proceeds to the next level. If the player runs out of time or energy, the game is over.

Background  The song has been noted for its biblical imagery, and has also been analyzed as a political metaphor. In a 1984 interview with Kurt Loder for Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan discussed his inspiration behind the song: \\"Me and another guy have a boat down there [in the Caribbean]. ‚ÄúJokerman‚Äù kinda came to me in the islands.

The Telegraph named \\"Jokerman\\" as Dylan's fourth best song, while Rolling Stone readers named the song one of Dylan's best post-1960s songs, with the magazine calling it \\"a brilliant six-minute tune about a twisted figure,\\" noting the song's biblicalBalassone, Damian (April 4, 2012) \\"Jokerman\\" imagery. Rolling Stone also listed \\"Jokerman\\" at #46 on its list of 100 Greatest Bob Dylan Songs.

The mansion is the birthplace and childhood home of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Finnish military leader, statesman and sixth president of Finland (1944‚Äì1946). History The Fleming family acquired the Louhisaari estate around the middle of the 15th century. The Louihisaari Flemings held prominent offices in the kingdom of Sweden (and Finland). , admiral and governor of Finland constructed the manor in 1655. After three hundred years the Fleming family had to sell the house due to financial circumstances. The Mannerheim family acquired the manor in 1795. Known residents were Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish entomologist and governor of the Viipuri province, and his grandson Marshall Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, who was born here in 1867. Baroness Wilhelmina Mannerheim moved to Sweden and sold the house to Oskar Hannus in 1903. A charity committee in honour of Marshall Mannerheim purchased the mansion and donated it Finnish State in 1965, who opened it as a museum for visitors in 1967. The museum gives a good impression how people lived between the 17th and 19th centuries. Architecture & design The house is a fine and rare example of a Palladian-style country house in Finland.Irma Lounatvuori and Marja Terttu Knapas, Louhisaaren kartano: suku ja r√§lssi - s√§teri ja kirkko, Museovirasto, Helsinki, 2005. The architect is unknown, but some presume Herman Fleming, the owner, to be the builder and designer. During its history, the buildings (manor and annexes) more or less remained in their original form, but were subject to renovations and repair. During the restoration of the 1960s, the exterior was restored back to its 17th century style as much as possible. The first and third floor of the manor were also restored in 17th century style, while the second floor was brought back to the 18th and 19th century design. The house is surrounded by a park in English landscape style.

His work helped create similar government positions in over 30 other global cities. Elected in 2012, Milan worked directly with the nightlife economy in Amsterdam. While night mayor, 24-hour venue permits were granted and crime around Amsterdam's Rembrandtplein was reduced. Milan's work was replicated in places like London with Mayor Sadiq Khan's 2016 appointment of \\"night czar,\\" Amy Lam√©, and New York's Ariel Palitz in 2018. Rembrandtplein Transformation During his time as night mayor, Mirik Milan oversaw the transformation of Amsterdam's Rembrandtplein. The three-year project included making the plaza more accessible to pedestrians, creating a mobile website for managing complaints, and enlisting Rembrandtplein hosts to keep social situations from escalating. Most notably, alcohol-related problems dropped by 25% as a result of Milan's work. Global Impact In addition to London and New York, Milan's work influenced municipal governments in Paris, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Madrid, San Francisco, Sydney, Seattle, Berlin, Tbilisi, Valpara√≠so, Santiago, Manchester, Austin, Toulouse, Tbilisi, Mannheim, Florence, Vilnius, San Luis Potosi City, Nijmegen, Gronigen, Zwolle, Den Haag, Eindhoven, Orlando, Florida, Pittsburgh, Iowa City, Iowa, Aberdeen, Fort Lauderdale, Asuncion, Paraguay, and Kazan, Russia to appoint \\"night mayors.\\" While Night Mayor of Amsterdam, Milan hosted the first global \\"Night Mayors' Summit\\" to create a framework for other cities. 20 world leaders were in attendance.

Using data provided by Musicboard Berlin, and Harvard University, Creative Footprint creates a score based on a city's cultural programming, impact, and support from local government. Berlin, for example, achieved a 8.02 out of 10 rating. The data Creative Footprint collects is used to show value of creative spaces and influence civic leaders.. Under the consultancy, VibeLab, Mirik and Lutz compiled the Creative Impact NYC report in September 2018 in conjunction with University of Pennsylvania Researcher Michael Fichman. Among data collected, the study pinpointed NYC's most experimental venues as being located in Ridgewood, Queens and Bushwick South, Brooklyn. The report ranked NYC behind Berlin with a 7.29 out of 10. N8BM A'DAM Mirik Milan founded the N8BM A'DAM foundation with Ella Overkleeft and Michiel Friedhoff in 2014.

ECSIT is a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, embryonic development, and the assembly and stabilization of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).  Structure  ECSIT is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 in position 13.2 and has 9 exons. The ECSIT gene produces a 49 kDa protein composed of 431 amino acids. ECSIT's interactions with p65/p50 NF-Œ∫B proteins is dependent on lysine 372 ubiquitination. ECSIT also contains an N-terminal targeting signal that causes it to localize to mitochondria where only the 45 kDa mitochondrial ECSIT is found to interact.  Function  ECSIT has been found to play multiple roles in cell-signaling, including those that utilize Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TGF-Œ≤, and BMP. ECSIT plays a regulatory role as part of the TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex that is involved in the activation of NF-Œ∫B by the TLR4 signal and through its interactions with TRIM59 to negatively regulate NF-Œ∫B, IRF-3, and IRF-7-mediated signal pathways. Additionally, ECSIT appears to contribute to bactericidal activity in TLR signaling through its interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Importantly, ubiquitination of ECSIT has shown itself to be necessary for the activation of p65/p50 NF-Œ∫Bs in TLR4 signaling. Functioning as a scaffold protein, ECSIT is also essential for the association of RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I or MDA5) to VISA. The bridging of these receptors to VISA is an important signaling event used in innate antiviral responses. Apart from inflammatory and immune responses, ECSIT, in its 45 kDa, mitochondrial form helps maintain assembly chaperone NDUFAF1's stable presence in the mitochondrion. Through this interaction, ECSIT is demonstrated to play an important role in NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly and stabilization. Finally, it is important to note that ECSIT is required for normal embryonic development.  Interactions  ECSIT has 136 protein-protein interactions, with 53 of them being co-complex interactions. In addition to TAK1, TRAF6, TRIM59, RIG-I-like receptors, VISA, and NDUFAF1 interactions, ECSIT can interact with MAP3K1 and SMAD4, and is a part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex.

Born in St Albans, Menlove transferred in 1920 from Barnet & Alston to Aston Villa. He didn't make any league appearances for Villa and moved on to Crystal Palace, then of the Southern League. He scored his only hat‚Äìtrick for Palace in a Southern League march versus Gillingham in March 1920. The following season Palace joined the newly constituted Third Division and with Menlove scoring five goals that season they topped the league and secured promotion to the Second division. Notable that season was an FA Cup win over then First Division Manchester City, a game in which Menlove scored. The following season Palace achieved a 6-0 FA cup win at first division Everton (this remains Everton's largest home cup defeat) with Menlove netting a couple. His tally of seven goals in the 1921‚Äì22 season for now second division Palace encouraged First Division Sheffield United to sign him in the spring of 1922. During his spell (1922‚Äì1926) at Sheffield United in 81 appearances Menlove scored 43 goals (41 in the league) including two hat‚Äìtricks: against Tottenham in March 1924 and Birmingham in October 1925. Despite his goal scoring record Menlove did not play in Sheffield United's 1925 FA Cup Final winning team. After leaving Sheffield United Menlove played for the 1926‚Äì1927 Midland League runners-up Boston Town and was there the following season too. In 1929 Menlove moved to Bangor in North Wales and played with Bangor Athletic playing in the Wales National League (North), and he married whilst in the city. In 1932 Menlove was playing for Ashford Town in the Kent League - a season in which the club were league runners-up and they scored an Ashford Town season record 115 league goals. The following season he served as player- manager at the club Menlove died in July 1970.

The kit is provided in a small pouch and can detect the presence of the chemical agents within five minutes. In 2004, one of the sensors from the Agentase CAD Kit, the Agentase Nerve Agent Sensor, was recognized by the U.S. Army as one of ten ‚ÄúGreatest Army Inventions‚Äù of 2003.  History  The development of the Agentase CAD Kit first began as a collaboration between Alan Russell from the University of Pittsburgh and researchers from the Army Research Office (ARO), an extramural basic research component of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). Russell was researching the interface between enzymes and polymers and was investigating how to create a polymer sponge-like material that could detect the pH-dependent catalytic activity of enzymes. In the early 1990s, Russell reached out to ARO with a research proposal to explore a variety of enzymes that had differing responses to temperature and pressure. The scientists at ARO accepted the proposal and coordinated research efforts with the University of Pittsburgh. The combined efforts led to the discovery of a functional catalytic buffering system that could detect the presence of nerve agents, and Russell published the paper reporting this discovery in 2002. Following the publication, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) facilitated the process to turn the discovery into a commercially viable product, resulting in the development of the handheld Nerve Agent Sensor, a pen-shaped sensor with enzyme-containing polymers at the tip that could identify the presence of nerve agents like VX and sarin with a color change from yellow to red. Russell and his former student, Keith LeJeune, then co-founded a private company called Agentase LLC to manufacture enzyme-based sensors. In 2003, Agentase LLC developed warfare- grade blood and blister agent sensors that could detect the presence of mustard gas and other hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride-based agents. Around the same time, the company enhanced the capabilities of the Nerve Agent Sensor to develop the Nerve Agent Sensing Biopolymer Wipe, an enzyme-based biosensor that could detect nerve agents at surfaces, in solution, and in the air. With the help of a program developed by ARL chief scientist Stephen Lee that enforced decontamination and protection against chemical warfare, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency fielded the Agentase‚Äôs nerve sensors and its blood and blister agent sensors in the war in both Iraq and Afghanistan. By 2005, Agentase LLC assembled together the Agentase CAD Kit, which bundled the nerve sensors with the blood and blister sensors in single kit. The Agentase CAD Kit was marketed not only to the U.S. Department of Defense but also to emergency first responders and chemical workers that handled hazardous materials. In the late 2000s, Agentase LLC, with support from the Army Research Laboratory, developed the Agentase Chemical Agent Disclosure (CAD) spray, a spray-based product that detected the presence of nerve agents and pinpointed their location on surfaces. Agentase LLC was later acquired by FLIR Systems in 2010.  Sensors  = Nerve Agent Sensor = The Nerve Agent Sensor detects the presence of specific chemical agents by reading the pH levels of the target through the use of hydrolytic enzymes. Previously, the use of catalytic hydrolysis reactions to degrade nerve agents faced problems due to the subsequent generation of acid that led to a severe drop in pH levels. High concentrations of a nerve agent have caused the buffering capacity to exceed and the pH to drop drastically. In order to keep the pH in an optimum range, the Nerve Agent Sensor employed a low-molecular-weight material that would convert into a base only when it was demanded, i.e. when the substrate was hydrolyzed and the pH began to drop. The sensor used an acid-producing enzyme in combination with a base-producing enzyme, each with different pH-dependent activity profiles, so that the relative rates of each enzyme changed as the pH changed, causing the pH levels to stabilize. Due to its high sensitivity, the Nerve Agent Sensor demonstrated considerable resistance to environmental factors, such as high temperatures, as well as interference from other compounds. It also has a shelf life of two to three years. = Nerve Agent Sensing Biopolymer Wipe = The Nerve Agent Sensing Biopolymer Wipe acts as a biosensor that is capable of detecting specific nerve agents on surfaces, in solution, and in the air. It maintains a dynamic pH equilibrium by utilizing the pH-dependent catalytic activity of a base- producing enzyme and an acid-producing enzyme. The production of acid stems from butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-catalyzed butyrylcholine hydrolysis while the production of base stems from urease-catalyzed urea hydrolysis. When both enzyme systems are active, the pH remains constant. However, the presence of a nerve agent causes cholinesterase to become inhibited and the hydroxide ion production from urea hydrolysis rapidly increases the pH level. The biopolymer wipe has exhibited several notable characteristics, including high sensitivity to CWAs, resistance to high temperatures, an almost-immediate response rate, and a shelf life as long as five years.  Operation  Emergency responders could use this kit to conduct surface cross examination for the presence of nerve (G and V series), blood (AC), and blister (AC) agents, acids, bases, aldehydes, and oxidizers. The Agentase kit acted similar to a glow stick. The operator cracked the ampule inside the sensor barrel which released the enzyme solution into a sponge. The sponge was then applied directly to a surface for sample collection. Each sensor provided color codes so that chemical detection results could be understood by personnel without extensive training and skills. The kit was used in a number of military, law enforcement, and emergency response scenarios.

Grant. The 91-day round-trip journey across the United States began in Honolulu on November 17, 1874 and returned to Hawaii on February 15, 1875. His arrival at San Francisco on November 28 was the beginning of a state visit, making him the first reigning monarch of any nation to set foot in the United States. Upon his arrival in Washington, DC, the United States Congress held the first joint meeting in the body's history, less formal than a joint session, to receive him. President Grant hosted him as honoree of the first state dinner at the White House. A career politician who rose through the ranks of chiefs, KalƒÅkaua had previously been to California and Canada with Prince Lot in 1860 as a 23-year-old government bureaucrat, more than a dozen years away from his accession to the throne. The Hawaiian government sent him to Washington, DC this time to seek the elimination of tariffs on the kingdom's sugar exports, after previous attempts had failed. There had been concerns about KalƒÅkaua's willingness to make the journey; however, after putting Elisha Hunt Allen in charge of the negotiations, he sailed for San Francisco, and journeyed across the United States by rail. He was well-received by government officials on federal, state and local levels, and accorded respect as a commander-in-chief by military representatives. Although ill with a viral infection throughout much of his trip, the king accommodated the relentless attention of being in the spotlight across America. He accorded journalist requests for interviews, and interacted with the general public, shaking hands and signing autographs, while crowds of curiosity seekers grew with each stop. Anticipation had grown so strong by the time he reached Washington, DC, that spectators gathered on rooftops to watch him pass by. Goodwill generated by KalƒÅkaua is credited for doing much to help move legislation for the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 through the necessary channels. The resulting close economic ties between the Hawaiian islands and the United States became a major factor leading to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. Background KalƒÅkaua was a career politician who rose through the ranks of chiefs, and was named by Kamehameha III in 1844 as eligible to be king. Kamehameha V, the last of the Kamehameha dynasty, died on December 12, 1872, without naming a successor to the throne. Under the 1864 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, if the king did not appoint a successor, a new king would be elected by the legislature to start a new royal line of succession. Lunalilo became the first elected monarch of Hawaii, with KalƒÅkaua holding the rank of Colonel on the royal military staff. Upon Lunalilo's death on February 3, 1874, a legislative election was held, with KalƒÅkaua being sworn in as monarch on February 13. Two weeks after taking office, he reorganized the Hawaiian military and restored the Household Guards recently abolished by Lunalilo. Like his predecessors, he belonged to fraternal organizations, as a member of the freemasonry Lodge Le Progres de l‚ÄôOceanie, and as the founding member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Hawaii. When KalƒÅkaua embarked on his state visit to the United States, nine months after being elected, he was the first reigning monarch to visit America, but not the first member of Hawaii's royal family to do so. He was the second reigning Hawaiian monarch to travel abroad, having been preceded in 1824 by King Kamehameha II and Queen KamƒÅmalu, who had traveled to the United Kingdom via the Strait of Magellan, both of them dying of measles while in London. Prior to either of their accessions, brothers Prince Liholiho (Kamehameha IV) and Prince Lot (Kamehameha V) had accompanied Dr. Gerrit P. Judd on a year-long diplomatic mission, from September 11, 1849 to September 9, 1850. Judd's mission took them to San Francisco, Panama, Jamaica, New York, London and Paris. Kamehameha IV's widow Queen Emma had visited New York and San Francisco in 1866 on her return from a personal visit to England and France. KalƒÅkaua had previously visited the United States in late 1860, when he was chief clerk of the kingdom's Department of the Interior. On that trip, he had accompanied Minister of the Interior Prince Lot, high chief Levi Ha ªalelea, and Hawaii's Consul for Peru Josiah C. Spalding on a two-month tour of British Columbia and California.; The quest for tariff easement Since the days of visits by whaling ships, and the arrival of the first missionaries in 1820, Hawaii became increasingly populated by non-residents operating within the kingdom's business community. Many of them became friends and advisors to the monarchy. The Alien Land Ownership Act was written by American attorney William Little Lee who arrived in Hawaii only a year before being appointed Land Commissioner. The Act, passed by the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom on July 10, 1850, allowed non-residents to own Hawaiian land. During the reign of Kamehameha III, sugar production in Hawaii became a successful enterprise, with sugar refineries in Oregon and California as the primary customers, and the kingdom looking to expand its market, but being increasingly hampered by tariffs on their product. The kingdom also had strong economic ties to the United Kingdom. Queen Emma was descended from a British subject, and Queen Victoria had been the godmother of Emma's son Prince Albert Kamehameha. Anglo-American planters operated tariff-free within their own customer bases. In the latter half of the 19th century, the sugar trade had become a booming industry, but import taxes severely dampened Hawaii as a viable economic competitor. Hawaii's sugar planters had worked for decades with the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom to find a viable remedy to the global market impingement on their profits caused by the tariffs. Solutions debated were tariff reciprocity treaties, annexation of Hawaii by the United States, formal alliances with other countries, and the cession of Pearl Harbor. An 1854 treaty for Hawaii's annexation to the United States was submitted to Kamehameha III, but he never signed it. In 1867, a proposed reciprocity treaty got as far as the United States Congress, but was defeated in the Senate. An aborted 1873 effort to offer Pearl Harbor in return for tariff reciprocity was heavily favored by American owners of Hawaiian plantations. Strong opposition came from KalƒÅkaua and other leaders among the Hawaiian people. On August 1, 1874, Hawaii's legislature authorized KalƒÅkaua to ratify a reciprocity treaty in Washington, DC There was speculation that he was lukewarm on the idea. Diplomat Henry A. Peirce, who was serving as the United States Minister to Hawaii, stated, \\"I don't think the King cares much about the Treaty, but he hopes, as we Americans say, 'to have a good time' generally.\\" The king actually supported the idea of a reciprocity treaty, just not one that ceded Hawaiian land, and he did not want Hawaii to appear to be favoring a single nation. Concern arose that his absence might trigger a hostile takeover of the kingdom by a foreign power. After consulting with his privy council, he agreed to accompany the diplomatic team, but rather than being involved in the negotiations himself, KalƒÅkaua appointed Hawaiian Kingdom Minister to the United States Elisha Hunt Allen to take charge. After exchanges between Peirce and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, the US government extended a formal invitation to the king for a state visit and placed the man-of-war ship at his disposal. The king would leave the negotiating to his appointed commission, and focused his own efforts on building goodwill between the two nations, raising the island nation's visibility with visits to government leaders across the United States. On October 18, Minister Allen and Privy Councilor Henry A. P. Carter, of C. Brewer & Co., sailed for the United States. The members of the reciprocity commission who traveled with the king included Peirce, Oahu Governor John Owen Dominis, husband of KalƒÅkaua's sister Lili ªuokalani, and Maui Governor John MƒÅkini Kapena, a full-blood Hawaiian who supported a reciprocity treaty but who, during the reign of Lunalilo, had spoken out against cession of Hawaiian territory. Departing Hawaii (November 14‚Äì17, 1874) alt=King Kalakaua and Reciprocity Commission At  ªIolani Palace on November 14, the doors were opened to native Hawaiians for a traditional \\"ho ªokupu\\", a ceremonial giving of gifts to the king prior to his departure. KalƒÅkaua appointed his brother Leleiohoku II to act as regent during his absence. Likewise, Dominis appointed William F. Allen as acting governor of Oahu, and Kapena appointed Luther Aholo acting governor of Maui. Minister of the Interior William Luther Moehonua closed all government offices on November 16, as a public day of thanksgiving on KalƒÅkaua's 38th birthday. Celebration of the king's birthday began with morning services by various Christian denominations, extolling the historical significance of the upcoming visit. Salutes were fired from the three foreign warships in Honolulu Harbor. At the commencement of the morning service at Kawaiaha ªo, the king and members of the royal family entered the church around noon to address the assembled crowds. Rev. Moses Kuaea, of the Kaumakapili Church, offered a prayer, praised the king's efforts to save the nation's agricultural interest, and asked for the people to pray for his safety during his upcoming trip. The church choir performed \\"God Save the King\\", \\"He Mele LƒÅhui Hawai ªi\\", the national anthem written by Lili ªuokalani, and \\"Hawai ªi Pono ªƒ´\\", composed by the king and Henri Berger. In his farewell address, KalƒÅkaua stated: \\"... I believe that if such a Treaty can be secured, the beneficial effects will be soon apparent to all classes, and our nation, under its reviving influences, will grow again.\\"; The royal party consisting of KalƒÅkaua, his personal secretary E. M. Mayor, diplomat Peirce, governors Dominis and Kapena, and three or four servants departed Hawaii on the morning of November 17. The king was conveyed to the wharf on the personal carriage of Captain William E. Hopkins, of the Benicia. An estimated 3000 to 4000 well- wishers lined the wharf, and the crowds chanted Hawaiian mele, cheered, and wailed at the occasion of the king's leaving. The Hawaiian royal standard was unfurled and salutes fired from the ship as the king and his party boarded and sailed east. San Francisco (November 28 ‚Äì December 5, 1874) Map of KalƒÅkaua's journey across the United States, 1874‚Äì75 Flying the Hawaiian royal standard, the ship docked in San Francisco the evening of November 28. A formal reception by local dignitaries, along with a 21-gun salute from the Alcatraz Citadel, took place the next morning. They were joined on board by Edward C. Macfarlane, General John Schofield and his chief-of-staff William M. Wherry, and Hawaiian Consul for California Henry W. Severance. San Francisco mayor James Otis, members of the First Regiment National Guard, and the Presidio Band playing \\"He Mele Lahui Hawaii\\", escorted all to their suite at the Grand Hotel. alt=King Kalakaua in San Francisco 1874 During the king's week-long stay in San Francisco, the city absorbed all costs. Consul Severance acted as the royal greeter for the in-suite November 30 public reception. The following morning, Severance and the king's entourage sat for a portrait at the Bradley and Rulofson photograph gallery. Celso Caesar Moreno, who would later serve in the king's cabinet, presented himself as owner of three telegraph cable charter companies, regaling KalƒÅkaua with his tales of global adventures. The king made inspections of the military operations at Alcatraz Island and Mare Island Naval Shipyard on December 2, prior to relaxing at a private men's club. His appearances began to draw spectators, as he accompanied Japanese Minister Yoshida Kiyonari and Japanese Consul Charles Wolcott Brooks to the San Francisco Board of Brokers (predecessor to the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange) on December 3, followed by an afternoon at Woodward's Gardens. On December 4, the king visited the San Francisco Mint, and the Western Union Telegraph office, where he wired greetings to President Ulysses S. Grant and Chicago Mayor Harvey Doolittle Colvin, receiving an immediate reply from Grant. He sat for a portrait by photographer Thomas Houseworth, and granted a parting interview to the San Francisco Chronicle. San Francisco's enthusiastic reception for the dark-skinned monarch was less than a decade after the American Civil War had divided the nation over the issue of enslavement of persons of color. Giving non-white people equal access to public accommodations would be fought through legislatures and courts for years to come. The African-American newspaper Pacific Appeal noted the irony and speculated, \\"... there has either been a sudden abandonment of colorphobia prejudice, or an extraordinary amount of toadyism to a crown head by the San Francisco American people.\\" The royal party boarded three private cars provided by the rail company on December 5, and began their trip across the continent. In addition to Dominis, Kapena, Mayor and Peirce, the king's official party now included Schofield, Wherry, and Lieutenant Commander William H. Whiting, a junior officer of the Benicia. From that point forward, writer Joseph Irwin accompanied the royal party as an embedded journalist for The Daily Alta California. Train trip across America (December 5‚Äì11, 1874) The train passed through Sacramento, then through Nevada, by way of Winnemucca, Battle Mountain and Elko. They continued through Ogden, Territory of Utah to Fort Bridger, Territory of Wyoming, where they were entertained by the 4th Infantry Division band. Their train stopped at the Laramie depot on December 8 for a reception at the Railroad Hotel in Cheyenne, hosted by Governor John Allen Campbell. Among the dignitaries at the hotel were associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wyoming Joseph M. Carey, and Colonel Thaddeus H. Stanton.; ; ; At Aurora, Illinois a boisterous crowd cheered as the train passed through their town on its way to Grand Island, Nebraska. In Omaha, the train was met at the depot by an estimated 5,000 people, and accorded a 20-gun salute under the direction of General Edward Ord. They remained long enough for Mayor Champion S. Chase and the Omaha City Council to give them a personal tour of the city. During a late- night layover in Chicago on December 10, the king's cars were switched over to another line going east. On December 11, just after midnight, the train pulled through Fort Wayne, Indiana, and reporters from The Fort Wayne Sentinel boarded in hopes of being granted an audience. In spite of the king already being in bed, he tolerated being interrupted from his sleep to be interviewed.; Washington, DC (December 12‚Äì22, 1874) When the train carrying KalƒÅkaua arrived in Washington, DC on December 12, it was met at the station by treaty negotiator Minister Allen. The king's car was boarded by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, and Secretary of War William W. Belknap. Journalists on hand represented the New- York Tribune, the New York Times, the New York Telegram, the New York Star, the Baltimore Press Association, and The Republican. After a champagne reception, a United States Marines battalion and the Marine Corps Band escorted them past massive crowds lining B Street and Pennsylvania Avenue to the Arlington Hotel. KalƒÅkaua had become ill with a head cold on the trip and was being attended by a US Navy physician, when a message arrived from President Ulysses S. Grant, inviting him to be the guest of honor at a White House state dinner. Visitors to his suite were received by the other members of his entourage, and the White House state dinner was postponed. =Joint meeting of Congress (December 18)= On December 18, KalƒÅkaua was the first person in history received by the United States Congress in a joint meeting, in this case occurring in the President's Room of the United States Senate. This differs from a joint session of Congress, for which the United States Constitution requires a joint resolution, and is often used for formal addresses. Joint meetings of Congress are rare, and another one was not called until the 1900 Centennial of the Capital City. The king was escorted in by Senator Simon Cameron, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Representative Godlove Stein Orth, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was formally welcomed by a short speech from Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Michael C. Kerr. KalƒÅkaua's illness had hindered his ability to deliver an oration. Minister Allen instead read prepared remarks expressing the king's thanks for their hospitality, and hopes for continued favorable relations between their nations. He met privately with Massachusetts senator William B. Washburn, who extended an invitation from the American Board of Commission of Foreign Missionaries to visit them in Boston. =State dinner (December 22)= alt=King Kalakaua at the White House 1874 President Grant initiated the White House state dinner tradition when he hosted the December 22 dinner to honor KalƒÅkaua. Written invitations were sent out on December 19, for the 7‚Äì11 p.m. event. Dignitaries attending were: *Vice President Henry Wilson *Secretary of State and Mrs. Hamilton Fish *Secretary of War William W. Belknap *Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson *Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow *Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano *Postmaster General and Mrs. Marshall Jewell *Attorney General and Mrs. George Henry Williams *Chief Justice and Mrs. Morrison Waite *Senator Simon Cameron, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations *Speaker of the House of Representatives and Mrs. James G. Blaine *Representative Godlove Stein Orth, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs *Admiral and Mrs. David Dixon Porter *Sir Edward Thornton, 2nd Count of Cacilhas (dean of the diplomatic corps) and Lady Thornton Unable to attend, but also invited, was General William Tecumseh Sherman.; Visit to the Northeast (December 23, 1874 ‚Äì January 9, 1875) King Kalakaua, photograph taken in New York City on his return trip to Hawaii in December 1874. =New Jersey and New York (December 23‚Äì30, 1874)= Spectators lined the December 23 route, amassing at depots in Washington, D.C, Baltimore, Maryland, Wilmington, Delaware, West Philadelphia and stations through New Jersey. Guards foiled an attempted security breach at Trenton, as several men caught up in the frenzy of the moment tried to gain access to KalƒÅkaua. The New York City council held a reception at the train depot, followed by a carriage ride past throngs of curiosity seekers en route to the Windsor Hotel. During dinner with New York mayor Samuel B. H. Vance and city officials, they were entertained by a local musical band. On Christmas Eve, KalƒÅkaua, Wherry and Dominis enjoyed a sleigh ride through Central Park. At an unannounced visit to the coed Normal School, they were given a tour of the facilities by its founder Thomas Hunter. The king's visit to the New York Stock Exchange created excitement among the brokers. Capping the day, they attended a performance of The Black Crook at the Grand Opera House. A Christmas Day observance at Saint Thomas Church was followed by a photo session at Jeremiah Gurney's studio. Acknowledging the king's previous service as foreman of Hawaii Engine 4 in Honolulu, the New York City Fire Department took him on an inspection tour of nearby facilities on December 26. KalƒÅkaua and staff donned their dress uniforms for a private in-suite presentation of Army and Navy officers, during which members of the Board of Trade were also introduced. KalƒÅkaua accepted an invitation to appear on December 29 at P. T. Barnum Great Traveling World's Fair, Museum, Menagerie and Hippodrome. Barnum was the founder of Barnum & Bailey Circus, and had promoted the 1850‚Äì52 Jenny Lind tour of America. An advertisement for KalƒÅkaua's appearance ran in the New-York Tribune, and Barnum would later remember the event's attendance record as 20,000. Barnum provided the royal party with bannered box seats to view the performances. For the finale, Barnum and KalƒÅkaua rode the perimeter of the arena in an open carriage, as KalƒÅkaua waved and tipped his hat to the cheering crowd. That evening, KalƒÅkaua invited author Mark Twain to join the royal group in attending a stage production of Twain's 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today at New York's Park Theatre. The two had become acquainted in Hawaii in 1866 during the reign of Kamehameha V, when Twain was there as a reporter for the Sacramento Union. Unable to attend the play with the king, Twain invited KalƒÅkaua to dine at his Connecticut home. The king was unable to accept the invitation, due to a prior commitment in New Haven. On December 30, the New York masonic Lodge No. 330 held a reception at Doric Hall for their masonry brother KalƒÅkaua. =New England (December 31, 1874 ‚Äì January 9, 1875)= En route to Boston, they made a December 31 stopover in New Haven, Connecticut, home to Yale College. During a luncheon at New Haven City Hall, KalƒÅkaua paid tribute to Yale's role in training many of the kingdom's leaders. Speeches from Connecticut governor Charles Roberts Ingersoll and New Haven mayor Henry Gould Lewis were followed by an official review of the New Haven Fire Department, a service at Center Church, and a visit to the home of Yale professor Chester Lyman, where the king signed autograph books and photos of himself. A banquet at the home of New Haven postmaster Nehemiah D. Sperry concluded the day's events. New Bedford, Massachusetts had been the point of origin for many whaling ships and missionaries sent to Hawaii. The day after stopping in New Haven, they accepted an invitation from New Bedford's Mayor George B. Richmond to visit the town. KalƒÅkaua obliged autograph seekers during his visit to the Potomaka Mills plant. A collation (religious fasting meal) for the king was hosted by Mayor George B. Richmond, and attended by nearly 100 master mariners who had visited Hawaii, the New Bedford City Guards and the Schouler Guards. At city hall, a large audience joined them for the playing of the Hawaiian national anthem. Before departure, the king shook hands with every individual. Dinner with 60 guests at the Parker House included the king's cousin Mary Pitman, and another autograph session. On their January 2 arrival in Boston, the king indulged in a shopping trip, escorted by Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot and Governor-elect William Gaston. KalƒÅkaua was a guest at the swearing-in ceremony for the second term of Mayor Samuel C. Cobb, who hosted a banquet for him at the Revere House. The royal party attended services at Park Street Church on Sunday. KalƒÅkaua attended a legislative session of the Board of Aldermen and was the guest of honor at a joint reception by the United States Army and the United States Navy. Over the next few days, they participated in a guided tour of select schools in Boston and visits to the Merchants Exchange and the Massachusetts General Court. He was escorted through an inspection tour of the newly completed Boston and Providence Railroad depot at Park Square. He sat for a photo session at the studio of James Wallace Black. A tour of the manufacturing district of Lowell, Massachusetts was followed by a lunch with 150 guests, where he shook hands with many spectators. Arriving at the depot for his return trip to Boston, the king once again indulged anyone who approached him for an autograph. KalƒÅkaua and party arrived at Waltham by sleigh on January 8, to visit the Waltham Watch Company. Escorted through the factory by company executives, the king expressed interest in the details of how watches were manufactured. Following a visit to an art gallery in Watertown, they proceeded to Newton, boarding a Boston-bound train. Their return trip to San Francisco began on January 9.King Kalakaua left Boston Saturday for Chicago, via Niagara Falls... and going through Chicago where a halt of a day or two will be made, Thence they go to St. Louis, and from there across to San Francisco - it being the intention to reach Honolulu by the Tenth of February next. Train trip homewards (January 10‚Äì20, 1875) =Niagara Falls (January 10‚Äì11, 1875)= The train carrying the king arrived in Niagara Falls, New York, on January 10, for an overnight stay in a large suite at the Spencer House. Advance notice of his visit drew a crowd of spectators who waited for hours in the frigid temperatures at the train station. Accompanied by Kapena, Whiting, and Lieutenant G. M. Totten, and never having recovered from the illness he picked up at the start of his trip, the king confined himself to his suite. The following morning, they departed for Chicago in a private car provided by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. =Chicago and Milwaukee (January 12‚Äì16, 1875)= Upon arrival the morning of January 12, KalƒÅkaua's party was met at the depot by Chicago mayor Harvey Doolittle Colvin and numerous city officials. A private reception was held at the Grand Pacific Hotel, where the king's 5-room suite accommodations were provided at no cost by hotel manager John Drake. The following two days, accompanied by Mayor Colvin, Commissioner John Jones, and several members of the city council, the royal party inspected city infrastructure projects. The agenda included a tour of the city water works, grain storage elevators at Armour's Warehouse, the Union Stock Yards and a visit to the Chicago Board of Trade. Hooley's Theatre hosted the king's party for a performance of the play Lost in London. On January 15, KalƒÅkaua made a daytrip to Milwaukee as the guest of honor at the formal luncheon hosted by United States Congressman William Pitt Lynde. The congressman was a cousin to Amos Starr Cooke, who ran the Chiefs' Children's School that KalƒÅkaua and his siblings had attended. Lynde's daughter Clara had once visited Hawaii as house guest of the Cookes, when a youthful David KalƒÅkaua had been her unofficial guardian. Also in attendance at the luncheon was Wisconsin Governor Harrison Ludington. Upon his return to Chicago that same day, he attended a reception at Oriental Lodge No. 33, A.F. & A.M. On the morning of January 16, the royal party departed on the Chicago & Alton Railroad, bound for St. Louis, Missouri. =Missouri (January 18‚Äì20, 1875)= General William Tecumseh Sherman, unable to attend the White House state dinner, visited with the king at a stopover in St. Louis on January 18. The reception at the train station included Sherman, various city officials, newspaper reporters, and a police escort. Due to a large crowd gathered at the front entrance to the Southern Hotel, the police instead brought him through what was described as \\"the ladies' entrance\\". After a private reception by the gathered officials in the hotel, KalƒÅkaua was received at the Merchants' Exchange and later given a tour of the city. In Jefferson City, Missouri, he was the guest of a joint session of the state legislature on January 20. Following the visit, the royal party boarded a Missouri Pacific Railroad train heading for California. Return to Hawaii (January 27 ‚Äì February 15, 1875) Arriving in San Francisco on January 27, they quartered at the Grand Hotel. Consul H. W. Severance, who had been appointed by Kamehameha V in 1868, received the Royal Order of KalƒÅkaua in gratitude for his service. KalƒÅkaua made a visit to the Robin Hood Lodge of the Ancient Order of Foresters while he was in the city. On their last evening, the king received proposals from entrepreneurs interested in expanding their operations to Hawaii. Farewell speeches were made by the king, and by former speaker of the California State Assembly George Barstow, representing the Temperance Societies. On February 3, a volley of artillery salutes rang out from nearby forts as the carrying the royal party was escorted out of the bay at 11 a.m. by General Schofield and crew on the . US Commissioner to Samoa Albert Barnes Steinberger was a fellow passenger on the voyage home. Ninety-one days after the king had left Hawaii, the Pensacola docked in Honolulu on February 15, 1875. Aftermath Reciprocity Trophy presented to Henry A. P. Carter for negotiating the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 The Daily Alta California commented that the king's presence moved the process forward to where, \\"It is generally conceded that the reciprocity treaty will go through but with little opposition\\". Hawaiian historian Ralph S. Kuykendall believed KalƒÅkaua's state visit not only gave the king a greater understanding of the American people and the workings of their government, but also educated Americans about the Pacific island nation. The spotlight on Hawaii, \\"enormously increased the general interest in the current discussion of the proposed reciprocity treaty.\\" Hawaiian legislators Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´ and George Washington Pilip≈ç led the native Hawaiian opposition who saw the treaty as a step towards annexation of the kingdom and only beneficial to the elite number of Euro-American businessmen. A seven-year reciprocity treaty was negotiated and ratified in 1875. Going into effect September 9, 1876, it admitted Hawaii's sugar products into the United States duty-free. No Hawaiian land was ceded in the agreement. At the treaty's expiration, an extension was negotiated that ceded exclusive use of Pearl Harbor to the United States. The treaty's most immediate result was an increase in new United States plantation owners. San Francisco sugar refiner Claus Spreckels became a prime investor in Hawaii's sugar industry. Over the term of KalƒÅkaua's reign, the treaty had a major effect on the kingdom's income. In 1874, Hawaii exported $1,839,620.27 in products. In 1881, KalƒÅkaua embarked on a world tour to negotiate with friendly nations for contract labor for Hawaii's plantations. Exported products for 1890, the last full year of his reign, amounted to $13,282,729.48 (all figures given are Hawaiian dollars) Exportation of sugar during that time period went from to . As the kingdom's income rose, so did KalƒÅkaua's expenditures (all figures given are Hawaiian dollars): this included $343,595 to build and furnish  ªIolani Palace; a delayed coronation in excess of $50,000; and a $75,000 public celebration of his 50th birthday. He made an attempt, subsequently blocked by the legislature, to allocate a $1,000,000 bonus for his San Francisco friend Celso Caesar Moreno to lay an undersea telegraph cable, and briefly appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs. Moreno and Prime Minister Walter Murray Gibson proposed a Polynesian Confederation administered by Hawaii. The concept never came to fruition, but in an attempt to interfere in the politics of Samoa, an island group that consisted of what is now Samoa and American Samoa, Gibson persuaded the legislature to allocate $100,000 for a confederation steamboat. Increase in land ownership by businessmen, either missionary descendants or more recent investors, led to a proliferation of non-Hawaiians being elected to the kingdom's legislature. In 1887, KalƒÅkaua was forced to sign the Bayonet Constitution, codifying the legislature as the supreme authority over any actions by the monarchy. Sanford B. Dole, who helped draft it, asserted that key issues were the king's handling of finances, and the lack of a system of checks and balances over the monarchy's stewardship. The new law allowed non-residents to vote, while also placing economic and literacy restrictions on voting rights of residents. Asians, the primary work force on the plantations, had their voting rights stripped. KalƒÅkaua's brother and heir apparent Leleiohoku II died April 9, 1877. The king then proclaimed his sister Lili ªuokalani to be his successor. Upon his 1891 death, she ascended to the throne. On January 17, 1893, the Kingdom of Hawaii fell to a coup d'√©tat, planned and executed by the Committee of Safety, mostly foreign-born residents in Honolulu, whose goal was the annexation of Hawaii by the United States.

She is also a Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, NanoEngineering, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography and holds the Distinguished Chair in Physical Chemistry.  Education  Grassian studied Chemistry at the University of New York at Albany, graduating in 1981. She moved to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for her Masters, which she completed in 1982. She earned her PhD at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987. Her PhD supervisor was George C. Pimentel.  Career  In 1990 Grassian joined the faculty of the University of Iowa, where she earned a General Electric Foundation Faculty Fellowship. She began to research the reactions between trace atmospheric gases (i.e. nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds) and mineral dust. She has since established herself as one of the world's leading scientists studying the environmental reactions on oxide and carbonate surfaces. She was appointed full Professor and won the Distinguished Achievement Award in 2002. There are several particles in the Earth's atmosphere, mostly consisting of mineral dust and sea spray, and their surfaces have the ability to influence the Earth's climate. She demonstrated that during the daytime, mineral dust aerosols can convert nitrogen dioxide into nitrous acid. Aerosols can be generated in volcanoes, wildfires, coal- fired power plants and vehicles. She was named the F. Wendell Miller Chair in Chemistry and Director Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute in 2010. She was appointed co-Director of the National Science Foundation Center for Aerosol Impacts on Chemistry of the Environment (CAICE). She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2010 and the American Chemical Society in 2011. Starting in 2013 Grassian was named Editor-in-Chief of Environmental Science: Nano a new journal from the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Publishing and held that appointment for five years. She is also an editor at the Surface Science Reports. She won the University of Iowa Scholar of the Year Award in 2014. She mentored over 300 students in her laboratory. She became a Chartered Chemist in 2015. In 2016 moved to the University of California San Diego. Here she leads the Grassian Research Group. They work on environmental interfaces such as atmospheric and marine relevant aerosols. They also look at the applications, implications, and toxicity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. Her team also researches the chemistry on indoor surfaces, including the interactions of indoor gases with components of paints (titanium dioxide), glass, concrete, and drywall. Grassian collaborates with scientists at the Scripps Hydraulics Lab to study particles generated in sea spray. By researching the properties of sea spray aerosol, such as hygroscopicity and chemical reactivity, Grassian looks to develop an understanding of our atmosphere that will help improve current climate models. In 2017 she helped identify that the bubbles that appear on the surface of breaking waves forms particulate matter that depends on molecules secreted by phytoplankton and floor dwelling bacteria for its overall composition.

It is estimated that between 1866 and 1963 over 200,000 ounces of gold were produced from mines in the Tati Goldfields. History The area along the Tati River was pit mined by the Bakalanga before the arrival of Europeans.See It may have been one of the sources of wealth for the Great Zimbabwe empire (c. 1200 to 1450). In 1866 Karl Mauch discovered the Tati goldfield, making it the first one discovered by Europeans in southern Africa. This led to the first South African gold rush. Geology The gold mineralization occurs in quartz veins, intruded into the volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Tati greenstone belt. Other economic minerals occur including nickel and copper. The major formation is the Selkirk Formation which is up to 1000 meters thick. The Selkirk is composed mostly of redeposited dacite and rhyolite, with some darker volcanics, and minor quartzites and quartzitic schists.

Early life Abrams' parents, Michael Abrams and Lydia Chegwyn Abrams, came from Cornwall, England. Abrams was born in a miner's cabin in Eagle River, Michigan, November 20, 1860. His early life was a period of hard struggle to gain an education. Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, he was apprenticed to a blacksmith; he then began to teach at a country school in order to earn the money which would enable him to go to college. After obtaining in 1883 a Bachelor of Science degree at Valparaiso, he attended Dartmouth Medical School, from which he was graduated in 1889. Later he did postgraduate work at Long Island College Hospital, and in 1902 Olivet conferred on him the honorary degree of Master of Arts. The doctor began his practice in Centennial, Michigan, and later removed to Dollar Bay, where he spent the remainder of his life. In 1890 he was married to Ida L. Howe, of Howell, Mich. One child, a daughter, was born to them, but died in early infancy. He was survived by his wife, several sisters and two brothers, one of whom, James Abrams, was a physician at Calumet, Mich. Career In 1907 he was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives. His legislative experience and knowledge of parliamentary procedure made him the backbone of all medical legislation in the state. Appreciation of the fairness of his nature was shown, when in 1913, during the copper miners' strike, the State appointed him as intermediary between agitators and employers. He was a politician of high type, straightforward and relentless in his pursuit of right. Nothing could stop him when on the trail of error, if he believed his action would be beneficial. It was said of him that he had stopped More detrimental and furthered more useful measures than any other medical man in Michigan. These same characteristics were not only evidenced in state affairs, but had an influence national in scope. In much demand as a public speaker, he rarely spoke at length, but always with a wonderfully earnest manner and a masterful delivery. His knowledge of history, combined with his enthusiasm, made him a most interesting speaker. Without doubt he was the best authority in the state on Cornish history, beliefs and customs. In short, he was ever loyal to the spirit of his ancestry. Dr. Abrams was the owner of a fine medical library with full files of about twenty periodicals. He was intensely patriotic and at the time of his death was president of the local chapter of the Red Cross, member of the state committee, Council of National Defense, and, as acting president of the State Board of Health, was much interested in Camp Custer, and made frequent visits there. Physically, Dr. Abrams was rather small, but wiry and active. At one time he was fond of wrestling, and very proficient in the art. His fingers were remarkably slender and quick in the most delicate operations. Besides being a member of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Dr. Abrams belonged to the American Medical Association, was a member of the state and local medical organizations, charter member of the A. K. K., one of the oldest medical fraternities; also member of the American Society of Social and Political Economics, and the American Geographical Society. He was surgeon to various railroad and mining companies in the Upper Peninsula; consulting surgeon and lecturer on gynecology and obstetrics at the Lake Superior General Hospital, Lake Linden; surgeon-in-chief to St. Joseph's Hospital at Hancock. His last appearance in public was in addressing a gathering for the Red Cross the evening before his death. His talk was masterly and full of feeling. It was remarked that he spoke from first to last as one inspired, as one apart and looking on. His death occurred suddenly, shortly before midnight, May 20, 1918, after an evening spent in study in his library.

It has reddish tinged flowering stems and line-shaped, narrowing wedge-shaped leaves of 2¬Ω‚Äì5 cm(1‚Äì2 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, with one to three blunt teeth, whorl-shaped, flat-topped, at first pale lime green but later carmine flower heads of 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1‚Äì1¬º in) across, mostly individually but sometimes grouped with two or three, each on a stalk. The flower heads occur from July to October. From the flowers occur long styles with a slightly thicker tip, which together give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Karoo pincushion in English. Flowering heads can be found from July until February. It naturally occurs in fynbos in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum saxatile is a low, rising to sprawling shrub of ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ m (1‚Öî‚Äì2¬Ω ft) high and 1‚Äì1¬Ω m (3‚Öì‚Äì5 ft) wide. The reddish tinged flowering stems initially carry some soft hairs, which are soon lost, and are 2‚Äì4 mm (0.08‚Äì0.16 in) thick. The leaves are loosely pointing at an angle towards the tip of the stem, or are very rarely pointed upward, are line- shaped, narrowing wedge-shaped to the foot, 2¬Ω‚Äì5 cm(1‚Äì2 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, initially covered in powdery hairs, which are soon lost. The tip mostly has one thickened tooth, sometimes two or three and the margins often curl inwards. The flower heads are whorl-shaped (or turbinate), 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1‚Äì1¬º in) across, usually set individually but occasionally grouped with two or three, each on a stalk of ¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.2‚Äì0.6 in) long. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flat, approximately 7 mm (0.28 in) across. The bracts that subtend the head are lance-shaped with a pointy or pointed tip, ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) long and about 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, cartilaginous in consistency, softly hairy, and set in four overlapping whorls. The bract that subtends each flower individually is densely silky hairy, with a regular row of equal-length hairs along the edge, lance-shaped with a pointy or pointed tip, 1¬º‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) long and 2‚Äì2¬Ω mm (0.08‚Äì0.10 in) wide. The straight 4-merous perianth is about 2 cm (0.8 in) long, initially pale lime green but later tinging carmine red. The lowest, fully merged, hairless part of the perianth, called tube is funnel-shaped and 5‚Äì6 mm (0.20‚Äì0.24 in) long. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise is straight, consists of four thread-shaped sliky-hairy lobes, that curl back sharply near their tip. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, consists of four silky-hairy. narrowly lance-shaped to linear lobes of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. From the perianth emerges a thread-shaped style of about 3 cm (1.2 in) long, that tapers nearing the tip. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is bluntly cylinder-shaped, about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, and hard to distinguish from the style. The ovary is subtended by four awl-shaped, opaque scales of about 1 mm long. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24). = Differencies with related species = Leucospermum saxatile differs from is closest relatives by the narrow wedge-shaped to linear leaves, narrowed towards the foot, with the margins often curled inwars, the lance-shaped pointed bracteoles and the initially pale green perianth.  Taxonomy  Richard Anthony Salisbury first described the Karoo pincushion and named it Leucadendrum saxatile in 1809, in a book by Joseph Knight in 1809 titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Salisbury. It is assumed that Salisbury had based his review on a draft he had been studying of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown however, called the species Leucospermum diffusum. Salisbury's names were ignored by botanists because of the alleged plagiarism in favour of those that Brown had created, and this was partly formalised in 1900 when Leucospermum was given priority over Leucadendrum. This was not done for the species names. John Patrick Rourke in 1967, realised both are synonymous and created the necessary new combination Leucospermum saxatile. L. saxatile has been assigned to the section Crinitae. The species name saxatile means \\"of the rocks\\".  Distribution and ecology  Leucospermum saxatile only occurs in a narrow zone of so-called arid fynbos, along the northern slopes of the Langeberg near Riversdale district, fringing the renosterveld of the Little Karroo, from Rietvlei westwards to Muiskraal, a distance of just 30 km (20 mi), at an altitude of 450‚Äì600 m (1500‚Äì2000 ft). Locally dense stands either scramble over the neighboring shrubs or spread across the barren rock.

Tilsley became a full-time author after the publication of his first novel, Plebeian's Progress (1933), and subsequently published over twenty novels, including She Was There Too (1938), Pleasure Beach (1944), Champion Road (1948), Heaven and Herbert Common (1953), and Brother Nap (1954).Stringer, J (ed.) 1996, \\"Frank Tilsley.\\" The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English, Oxford University Press. ProQuest Ebook Central. Accessed 3 August 2018. His novel Mutiny (1958) was adapted for film and released as H.M.S. Defiant, starring Alec Guinness and Dirk Bogarde, in 1962. Tilsley was also a frequent radio broadcaster and writer of popular television shows including The Makepeace Story. Rendering Accounts - The Writings of Frank Tilsley (The London Magazine, May 1997) THE LONDON MAGAZINE April/May 1997 \\"Rendering Accounts - The Writings of Frank Tilsley\\" by Paul Lester. During the less than quarter century of literary activity before his premature death Frank Tilsley had come to enjoy much popularity as a novelist as well as being well-known as a broadcaster on various BBC programmes including The Critics. In a writing career begun by that disturbing story of the rise and fall of an accountant‚Äôs clerk, The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress (1933), and ended by a novel exploring the background to the British naval rebellion of the 1790s, Mutiny (1957), Tilsley published twenty-seven novels, two of which, Little Man, This Now and The Land is Bright, coming out pseudonymously, the former appearing under his real name some years after he died. Tilsley also published perhaps one of the most honest autobiographical documents of the 1930s, We Live and Learn. But by 1957 he had become worried about his future, about his health, and, above all, become prey to that abiding fear of all serious authors - that his writing was drying up entirely. He was dissatisfied with his latest novel, Mutiny, which he was working on till the day he died, and would not let his publisher see it. In the spring of 1957, Frank Tilsley committed suicide. He was just fifty-two years old. The Times obituary of Tilsley saw as his strength as a novelist ‚ÄòThe lively fidelity with which the author caught the everyday life of ordinary men and women . . . his characterisation was always strong and his detail vivid and abundantly true‚Äô. Over the years his books had earned him plenty of critical praise. Nearly twenty years before The Times‚Äôs obituary The Times Literary Supplement had acclaimed Tilsley for ‚Äòa punch unequalled by almost any other writer on this side of the Atlantic‚Äô. V. S. Pritchett, writing in The New Statesman, called him ‚Äòobviously an outstanding writer‚Äô and numbered among Tilsley‚Äôs other notable admirers had been H. G. Wells, Cyril Connolly and J. B. Priestley. But the tragedy of Tilsley‚Äôs untimely end has been compounded by the subsequent neglect of his work. All of his books are now out of print, and it is increasingly difficult to find on the shelves of public libraries such masterpieces as Little Tin God, that perceptive study of a small man turning to Nazism. Tilsley was able to draw on a wide variety of experience to enable him to catch ‚Äòthe everyday life of ordinary men and women‚Äô. At various times he worked as an accountant, a club secretary, ran a cake and pastry shop and a seaside boarding house, was a teacher and a ledger clerk, never finding he could settle into any of them. But it was all to be set to some proÔ¨Åtable and successful purpose when he turned to the job of being a novelist. Frank Tilsley was born in Levenshulme, Manchester, the last of five children of a tailor. He attended a Manchester council school and thereafter spent some years as an accountant‚Äôs clerk or ‚Äòincorporated accountant‚Äô. His intellectual development in these early years would be illuminatingly described in his book We Live and Learn (1939), which relates his shifts of political allegiance in his early working years; in so doing he displays the honesty never to fall into the common trap of travestying views he has since renounced. From being a Conservative in his teens, he moved through The Liberal Party to arrive eventually at a very English form of socialism which would bear its most eloquent expression in his political testament First Things First (1938). He was a critic of authoritarianism, rejecting communism as ‚Äòsocialism minus the democratic sanction‚Äô. In the late 1930s, as a member of The Labour Party, he would be an advocate of the Popular Front policy against fascism, which was at variance with the official party line. Tilsley‚Äôs experiences as an accountant‚Äôs clerk played a major part in turning him to socialism. In the job of auditing he gained insight into the way firms operated. Management corruption and petty fiddling seemed a routine part of business practice. Tilsley also came to resent the injustice that boys with only an elementary school education like himself were heavily handicapped in getting into full chartered accountancy. After he married Tilsley left clerking to set up his own business which shortly failed. For about four years he worked as the secretary of The Salon Club, an arts club in Oxford Street, Manchester, arranging exhibitions, but then the place was closed down and the bailiffs were called in. In his spare time he had been working on his first novel, The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress, which was accepted and published by Gollancz in 1933. It was hailed by some critics as the All Quiet on the Western Front of the Depression and compared to Hans Fallada‚Äôs Little Man What Now? which, appearing earlier in the same year, traced the decline into poverty of a some- time clerk and shop-assistant. The central figure of The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress, Allen Barclay, is a clerk for a firm of accountants. Secure in his job, Barclay marries and moves to a nice bungalow in a commuter village. But the Depression bites, he loses his job and moves down the social scale to a cheaper house. He tries jobs such as door-to-door salesman and shoe-cleaning, and a spell on the dole before getting a job as an accountant at a small restaurant. Tempted by the opportunities the job affords, and feeling he has the right to emulate his employers corrupt practices in his own minor way, Barclay is driven to a petty theft which he fully intends to repay but is caught out before he is able to and loses his job. The novel charts Barclay‚Äôs rapid decline as, unable to find employment, he murders his wife, attempts suicide and is finally hanged. In his death cell, facing what he sees as his day of atonement, Allen reflects: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt fair, either. They decided you were not fit to live and then, for the first time, your life became important, they watched you, guarded you, made a fuss about you. Allen with a life to live was an unimportant nonentity; nobody‚Äôs business. But Allen with a life to lose was a very different proposition.‚Äù There is the final inspired sardonic touch with the report of Barclay‚Äôs execution featuring in the newspaper on the same page as a leading British statesman claims the country is recovering from the slump: ‚ÄúThe unprecedented sacrifices we had all so nobly borne (people had even paid their income tax more or less promptly) had placed us on the high road to prosperity. We had set an example to every country in the world, and could look forward to the future with the uttermost confidence . . .‚Äù Tragedy is not normally associated with such figures as Barclay in 1930s literature, but the widespread impact of the Depression period had numerous casualties among the white collar workers also, and it was to Tilsley‚Äôs credit that he was prepared to reach out beyond the stereotypes of tragedy to overlooked characters like Barclay, with an effect which is achieved with great restraint. The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress was an impressive literary debut. Tilsley had to wait till 1936 for his next book to be published. His second attempted novel, a rather long-winded work exposing the machinations of the monetary system, was rejected by Gollancz. Now in financial straits, Tilsley and his wife Clarice opened a shop which sold home-made pies and cakes. He found himself, as he put it, ‚Äòrolling pastry when he should have been at his typewriter\\". This project lasted six months before he moved on to trying the boarding house trade in Blackpool. Then he went to London as a teacher at a private school which, as his luck would have it, soon closed down. There followed a period as a ledger clerk with a firm of motor engineers. Adding to his by now rich store of work experience, he became an accountant at a big London public company running a multiple shop chain. This job once again collapsed and he was out of work for five weeks, which proved itself a blessing because during this time the compulsion to write returned and the result was a new novel entitled I‚Äôd Do It Again, which Secker & Warburg brought out in 1936. It was immediately hailed by H. G. Wells as ‚Äòfresh, sympathetic, real, vivid and beautifully told. I should put it equal with the best American story-telling and that is high praise‚Äô. Cyril Connolly called I‚Äôd Do It Again a ‚Äòtour-de-force‚Äô, ‚Äòa phenomenon . . . an attempt to apply the talkie-novel to the English scene . . . an attempt to write about England as if it were America‚Äô. It is a book written with pace and simplicity, in the first person, and in a rough staccato style which reminded critics of Cain‚Äôs The Postman Always Rings Twice. Like The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress, I‚Äôd Do It Again features an accounts clerk who sees through his Ô¨Årm‚Äôs swindling rackets, the misleading adverts, the mistreatment of both clients and employees, and is thereby lured into criminality himself. But, by contrast with Allen Barclay of The The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress, for the unnamed narrator of Tilsley‚Äôs second published novel his luck holds good when he fiddles his employers. He is being paid ¬£3 a week for a ¬£5 a week job at a mail order office and, prompted by his love of his beautiful wife who wants that bit more from life, he decides to systematically extract the ¬£2 a week he feels is his due. As he achieves what he wants, his relationship with his wife improves ‚Äògreatly and he cuts a stronger and more conÔ¨Ådent figure from the experience. The suspense of this book is heightened as it seems the protagonist‚Äôs high-risk activities are bound to be uncovered and he‚Äôll go the way of the luckless Barclay. But he survives auditors and succeeds in using the tricks of accountancy to his own ends and even gets promotion within the company. ‚ÄòHonesty isn‚Äôt a virtue. It‚Äôs a luxury\\", he comments. He has no regrets. The title of the book echoes the narrator‚Äôs sentiments: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt call what I‚Äôd done foolish. I‚Äôd do it again‚Äô. In a way The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress and I‚Äôd Do It Again, coming three years apart, complement one another - both protagonists are clerks who turn crooked when inspired by the evident crookedness pervading the business that employs them. One clerk goes down to oblivion on the end of a rope, the other climbs up the ladder of success in his small world. In both the work of accountancy gives insights into the corruption Tilsley sees as being at the heart of society, which might turn out either way for the individual who chooses to follow its selfish logic, though neither The Plebeian‚Äôs Progress nor I‚Äôd Do It Again present this dilemma in a narrowly political manner. The central character of the latter novel seems to have more than a little in common with the sort of ‚Äòanti-hero‚Äô of 1950s working-class writing, the cynical, anarchistical rebel, out for number one. The success of I‚Äôd Do It Again was followed by the publication of a version of the novel of Tilsley‚Äôs which had been rejected by Gollancz, this time completely re-written, under the title of Devil Take The Hindmost, about two boys armed with a sort of autocratic Socialist conviction who determine to conquer the world together but who in life enjoy contrasting fortunes and end as sworn enemies. The dealings of Bartoft, whose ruthless love of power leads him to the domination of the life of a small town in Lancashire, are often subtly drawn. Again fraudulent accounting and the workings of Ô¨Ånance capital are exposed at some length, though more laboriously and with less effectiveness here, and the book certainly lacks the suspense-filled qualities of I‚Äôd Do It Again. By this time Tilsley found he could earn a living as a writer, and other novels followed in quick succession, I‚Äôd Hate To Be Dead and She Was There Too (1938). Whereas the central figure of I‚Äôd Do It Again begins by trying to be fair and decent before succumbing to the temptations of embezzlement, the narrator of I‚Äôd Hate To Be Dead is hard-bitten from the start, an unpleasant, indomitable self-made man, who makes and loses fortunes in a colourful, brutal life. The book is slightly marred by the unlikeliness of an ending in which a daughter of his unfaithful wife (whose death he had deliberately hastened) finally salvages his fortunes and saves him from jail in spite of having had her life made a misery by him. This period, the late 1930s, saw the rise of fascism throughout Europe; a challenge Tilsley did not shirk in his writing. His treatment of the subject must be considered one of his great achievements, illustrated by his novel Little Tin God (1939). Carl Cramm, who, despite his German surname, is seven-eighths English, is, when the novel begins, a bank clerk of socialist persuasion. Overlooked for promotion in favour of a Jew, his creeping anti- semitism and resentment against the financial system he feels he‚Äôs slave to combines with a mounting frustration with life, encouraged by Higson, an active Nazi at his workplace. Cramm‚Äôs university-educated wife Jean‚Äôs feelings are particularly powerfully rendered as the strain on their relationship develops. Carl, resentful, among other things, at Jean‚Äôs superior education, becomes increasingly bullying and brutal in his attitude to her. The domestic sexual politics of fascism are illuminatingly explored in Little Tin God, with the tyranny of Carl towards his wife and young son which parallels the rise of Hitler and the growth of Carl‚Äôs sympathy with the dictator. Higson‚Äôs insidious influence increases and Cramm accompanies him to political meetings, and by the time he visits a relative in Germany he is ready to be a dedicated apostle of Nazism. There is much that rings true in Tilsley‚Äôs representation of the appeal of fascist ideals to the small, insignificant man who is full of feelings of inadequacy about his lot in life. Brian Howard in The New Statesman wrote of Little Tin God, ‚ÄòThe book . . . contains the best sketch of an English totalitarian propagandist I have read‚Äô. Effectively communicated too is Tilsley‚Äôs critical view of the pacifist position, in the shape of Cramm‚Äôs wife, whose reaction to Cramm‚Äôs domestic violence is submissiveness. She ceases to be a strong independent woman: ‚ÄúWe pacifists have to plumb human experience to the depths‚Äù, she reflects, ‚ÄúDegradation is perhaps the price we have to pay for trying to do things in a new way, for trying to do things by persuasion and example, instead of by force and law‚Äù. As war looms Cramm loses his job for assaulting a Jew at work, is recruited as a Nazi spy and his wife realises he cannot be transformed by good will, that he needs to be stood up to. But the conÔ¨Çict within herself about how to react to Carl‚Äôs thuggishness ends the novel on a note of uncertainty; the times too are uncertain, with the war i about to break out, forcing the issue. Little Tin God is a remarkable achievement both in its treatment of the development of the Nazi mentality in a small man, and in how that mentality translates itself into domestic brutalism. Little Man, This Now (1940), with its deliberately ironic echo of Hans Fallada‚Äôs earlier novel in its title, was originally published by Tilsley under the pseudonym ‚ÄòX.Y.Z.‚Äô It deals with a rent collector in Germany called Walter who, like Cramm, has an Anglo-German connection. Walter‚Äôs father, a socialist, had spent eight formative years in England, the legacy of which has had some impact on Walter‚Äôs attitudes. Again in Little Man, This Now one is struck by the refusal of the author to caricature what he disapproves of in depicting the articulacy of Walter‚Äôs thought after he loses his job, struggling between defiance of and advancement within the Nazi Party. Joining the Nazis and given a position of authority, Walter ceases to feel depressed and aimless, and experiences a real feeling of pride in his uniform, but continues to wrestle with his better nature, embodied in his secret guardianship of Anna, a girl survivor of a concentration camp. Walter‚Äôs son too becomes transformed into a Nazi and his spying on his own family causes problems, exacerbating Walter‚Äôs inner conflicts as well as threatening his position within the Nazi Party. But Walter becomes reinforced in his belief in Nazism by the success of Hitler‚Äôs aggressive moves abroad, beginning in the Rhineland. Tellingly, Tilsley depicts the gullibility of groups of British tourists in Nazi Germany with their gushing, infectious enthusiasm for the regime‚Äôs formalised obedience and responsibility when shown what the authorities want them to see. A part of Walter which is still receptive to his father‚Äôs opinions is bitterly disappointed by these visitors. Walter‚Äôs ‚Äòcore of uneasiness‚Äô about National Socialism is stilled by such experiences and by the success of Hitler‚Äôs aggression. But war comes and the old doubts resurface. Little Man, This Now, like Little Tin God, gives some genuine insight into just what Nazi ideology drew its strength from at grass roots level. Tilsley is convincing dealing with the little man caught up in great events and on the options he takes up which challenge or diminish his responsibility still further. In both books the use of central characters who hold some special connection with their country‚Äôs enemies helps focus their inner struggles and allows for dramatic comparisons to be made between the respective nations. During the Second World War, Tilsley became a Squadron Leader working on the coastal patrol defending convoys, an experience which resulted in his only book of short stories, The Boys of Coastal. The documentary sense of this book is strengthened by British official photographs of coastal patrols with quotes from the stories accompanying them. In these stories the otherwise small, perhaps inconsequential figure who in civvy street might find his life wasted in a job he is unfitted for, and whose ability goes unused, is often transformed by war into someone of consequence. The author is aware of human potential, is aware also that there are no simple heroes, that contradictions are always at work, but typically the pressures of war provide unlikely revelations of character. The war was remarkably productive for Tilsley. He published eight books, if of an uneven quality, which is understandable given the circumstances. These included one written right at the end of the war The Land Is Bright, appearing under a pseudonym, Francis Heaton-Chapel, alluding to a place in Manchester with some family associations. The Land Is Bright is about an RAF bomber team in which the pilot, Rogers, falls sick every time he encounters enemy searchlights, so the flight engineer has to stand in for him. The team stick by the pilot in spite of his incompetence for the task. The loyalties of the disparate characters in the team are such that they take the secret of the pilot‚Äôs weakness with them to their eventual doom on a bombing trip over Germany in which the regular flight engineer is replaced by an engineer who can‚Äôt fly a plane. The Land Is Bright is a tensely told and often moving account of RAF life culminating in a heroic disaster which makes few concessions to propaganda or sentimentality. One theme in Tilsley‚Äôs work in the 1940s is of the little man and woman rising above socially prescribed limitations by conscious effort if not monetary necessity. Lady in a Fur Coat (1941) has two people from quite different backgrounds thrown together by having been snowed-in at a railway station, both of whom are apparently failing in life. Tom has just broken from working on a farm with his crooked brother, and Greta, real name Elsie, is an actress in a struggling show called ‚ÄòWelcome Nineteen Forty‚Äô, aware she is being used and facing the sack as a dancer. The contrast between the two characters is great, but they show the capacity to endure and find much common cause in being temporarily brought together in extreme circumstances. Rather as the war was just then itself bringing widely differing people together in the desperate extremities of national survival. There are the accountants and property speculators featuring still in Tilsley‚Äôs work, like those the eponymous Peggy works for in Peggy Windsor and the American Soldier. Above all there is the character who sometimes transforms a defeated life into a victorious one, or in defeat shows up the nature of an acquisitive, grasping society (though this is never realised in a crudely propagandistic way), like the central figure in What‚Äôs In It For Walter? (1942). Walter Leonards plays the piano in a Butlin‚Äôs style holiday camp band and finds himself without any proper preparation for the massive test of endurance he is suddenly faced with pursuing a hundred hour marathon of continuous playing. He is being manipulated and flattered by corrupt interests in the camp, and all manner of intrigues ensue as Walter presses on to the impossible, to that point on his horizon where, as he puts it, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be nobody to laugh at me, to think me a washout‚Äù. He just fails to reach his objective, but what he does achieve is to again demonstrate the capability of the seemingly ordinary individual, whose achievements and worth go beyond money and are not to be measured by it either. The pressures placed on people to achieve within the culture and the effects of this on those who, not because of lack of ability but because of their background and circumstances, are unable to achieve, a theme in What‚Äôs In It For Walter?, is further developed after the war in Icedrome (1949). A young girl skater, Jean Mason, whose life centres on a local skating rink, a place of fantasy which fosters the illusion of being a world all of its own, finds that the realities of being handicapped by her humble circumstances continually break through. Living with her mother Dora, a struggling single parent who is forced to make all sorts of sacrifices to further her daughter‚Äôs development, Jean is prevented from making the most of what ability she has when in competition with those who can afford expensive tuition and facilities. Both the world of the ice-rink in Icedrome and that of the holiday camp in What‚Äôs In It For Walter?, are places where jealousies and injustices are rife, with only the illusion of classlessness promoted to conceal this. The sites of popular culture as well as those of the work-place Tilsley sees as full of snares for individuals who are disadvantaged and pressed into performing often in someone else‚Äôs interests, victims of the belief that all have a ‚Äòfair chance‚Äô. In Tilsley‚Äôs post-war work he was given to some repetition of material. For instance in Champion Road (1948) and Heaven and Herbert Common (1953), which, though well-observed and. done with much narrative skill, strike one now as rather over-long sagas after the rags-to- riches self-made working-class man formula originally typified in his own work back in 1938 in I‚Äôd Hate To Be Dead. But Champion Road in particular proved a great popular success at the time and was dramatised for BBC television. Of more interest are the two volumes Voice of the Crowd (1954) and its sequel, Brother Nap, which appeared in the same year. These books follow the history of two brothers, Nap and Ted Ellis, as seen through the narrative perspective of the latter. Tilsley traces their early lives, their various conflicts and relationships, their rise to prominence in the Labour Party and their work as Labour MP‚ÄôS deeply involved in the major issues of their time. We see Nap and Ted move up through the Labour Party machine and rub shoulders with both fictional and real-life politicians of the pre-war and post-war world. In Voice of the Crowd, for instance, there is a vivid picture of the Labour Party Conference which sees the downfall of Lansbury on the politics of appeasement and the Popular Front, and Ted‚Äôs battles with Nap have some parallels here, with Ted feeling much as Lansbury felt in being defeated on the Popular Front issue. Nap is a large belligerent Bevin-like figure, with greater ambition and ruthlessness than his more generous brother. Contributing to his political failure Ted has a wife quite unsuitable for a Labour MP, and he betrays her with an affair. Again well and faithfully dramatised is the working-class women‚Äôs perspective. In this case Annie Ellis, Ted‚Äôs , wife, who is shy, nervous and out of sympathy with the Labour Party. In Brother Nap Ted finds his ideals collide with the realities of his position in the post-war world. His frustrations mount as, after returning from war duty, he fails to get his home back from the unprepossessing people he rented it to, and also suffers embarrassments with the tax authorities. Ted senses he is losing his vocation as he finds the ideals of the Welfare State foundering, as he sees it, on the greed, laziness and limitations of the people involved. He loses his seat and faces bankruptcy. But as his determinedly ruthless, opinionated brother goes on from strength to strength in pursuit of his commitment to what he sees as the Labour cause he is convinced he himself embodies, Ted chooses the quiet path, returning to the pit where he began his working life, believing he can make a modest contribution to bettering the lot of his fellow workers. The message of disillusion is not hard to discern in these books, and the author is courageously critical of some received party political wisdom of those post-war years. Thicker Than Water (1955), though set in the English Midlands, seems likely was in part inspired by the Clapham Common murder of 1953, the emblematic motiveless Teddy Boy crime of the early 1950s, which was also to inspire Julian Symons‚Äôs Progress of a Crime (1960) and Tony Parker‚Äôs later documentary book The Plough Boy (1965). Tilsley‚Äôs talent for creating suspense, an outstanding feature in I‚Äôd Do It Again, is evident here also. It is a study of pressures on a whole family resulting from the condemning to death of the youngest son, Sid Greensmith, for running over a man in the commission of a car theft by a gang. The family is caught up in the tragedy with the doubts crowding in, as is the public, while the hopes for Sid‚Äôs life are continually raised only to be dashed. Here, as with Tilsley‚Äôs first novel, and as it would be with his last, the book ends with an execution. In the lead up to it it is a woman‚Äôs strength which comes shining through the horror of the situation, in the shape of Sid‚Äôs sister, Joan Greensmith, who has the crucial role of holding the family together. She is one of a long line of strong women in Tilsley‚Äôs fiction, such as the put-upon daughter Joan in I‚Äôd Hate To Be Dead, Dora, the self-sacrificing single parent in Icedrome, Sally Butterworth, who ekes out a living in a sea-side show in Pleasure Beach, or Grace Gregson, who runs the shabby south London cafe in The Jungle of Your Heart. His sympathetic insights here may be the result of his early experiences of sturdy, self-reliant Lancashire working-class women. With The Makepeace Story, written in collaboration with his son Vincent, Frank Tilsley helped pioneer in the 1950s the television family saga of generations (his son, incidentally, went on to be a successful TV writer and editor for the next twenty years, contributing over 100 scripts for such series as The Forsyte Saga, Dr. Finlay‚Äôs Casebook, Z-Cars, The Guardians and The Prisoner). This work, shown on BBC TV in 1955, was novelised as Seth Makepeace a year later. It was to be Frank Tilsley‚Äôs penultimate novel, and shared something in common with his final book, Mutiny. Seth Makepeace and Mutiny are both historical novels informed by the purpose of excavating the origins of class conflict, if from different sides, exploring the mentalities involved and the implications which may be drawn from this. In Seth Makepeace Frank Tilsley and son go back to the 1770s to examine the birth of the factory system and its distinctively aggressive capitalist view of the world. The book focuses on an enterprising young cottage weaver, Seth, who founds the pioneering industrial mill and prospers after having stolen the secret of the revolutionary spinning mule from Samuel Crompton. Seth makes the potent argument for the beginnings of the factory system, and in the cause of his notion of progress gains further social acceptance with an advantageous marriage to the moneyed local squire‚Äôs daughter. Convincingly portrayed are Seth‚Äôs entrepreneurial frustrations, his self-justification for his behaviour towards others, his hypocrisy and contradictions of character. Tilsley‚Äôs ability to empathise with those he cannot morally agree with is apparent once more. As in Voice of the Crowd and Brother Nap, fact and fiction are mixed so it is not easy to know where one ends and the other begins, as real historical figures like Crompton interact with fictitious ones like Seth. A strong woman is important here also, in this case the wife of Seth, who functions as the voice of conscience, for instance, on the matter of child labour. In Mutiny, the book he was working on on the day he died, Tilsley explores what he thinks of as the first modern strike by workers, the beginnings of modern unionism. It has as its background the Nore and Spithead mutinies of the 1790s. As Vincent Tilsley put it in his foreword to the book, what fascinated Frank Tilsley was that in planning and conduct the events constituted ‚Äòthe first really successful ‚Äústrike‚Äù, in its modern sense, in history. It is the first example of labour ‚Äòorganising itself on a considerable scale to light for, and obtain, improved conditions‚Äô, a ‚Äòcontrolled explosion which set the pattern of industrial warfare until the present day‚Äô. In the novel we get the conflicts of power between the authoritarian dictator‚Äôs personality of Scott-Padget and the more liberal humanitarian authority of Captain Crawford, and an investigation of the dilemmas of compromise, almost of appeasement, between the two views of exercising authority which in some respects recall the exploration of power relationships in Little Tin God. The suspense building up to the mutinies delineates in a telling way the motivation of the mutineers and their fate, in particular Vizard, the strong but ill-starred radical. As well as that ‚Äòlively fidelity with which the author caught the everyday life of ordinary men and women‚Äô The Times obituary referred to, Tilsley was not afraid to tackle the large issues of the period he lived through, and latterly explored historical themes bearing upon important contemporary concerns of social morality and power. When mapping twentieth century working-class writing Frank Tilsley must be reckoned a significant figure, whose work suggests some interesting continuity in bridging the 1930s and the 1950s; his career of course almost straddling these decades. This continuity is indicated stylistically and in terms of his approach to dealing with people‚Äôs experiences in their everyday working lives. That public libraries have sold off, or are busy selling off, Tilsley‚Äôs books from stock in a sorry short-sighted policy based on current ‚Äòpopularity‚Äô, and that his twenty-seven novels are all now out of print, must be a source of more than idle regret.

The route starts at MS 15 south of Newton and travels southeastward. The road turns east at a county road near Garlandville and travels to its eastern terminus at MS 503 in the unincorporated area of Hero. The route was designated around 1956, from MS 15 to MS 503, and has not changed significantly since. Route description The route is located in southern Newton and northern Jasper counties. In 2017, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 670 vehicles traveling on MS 504 east of County Road 5044 (CO 5044), and as few as 650 vehicles traveling southeast of Boutwell Road. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. MS 504 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 504 starts at the three-way junction with MS 15 in Newton County south of the city of Newton. The route begins travelling southeastward, intersecting Boutwell Road, and entering an area of farmland. The road enters a forested area at Nicholson Road and enters Jasper County past the intersection. The road continues southward until it reaches a T-intersection with County Road 24 (CO 24) near Garlandville. MS 504 turns east and begins travelling towards the Jasper‚ÄìNewton county line. At CO 5044, the route begins travelling southeastward towards its eastern terminus at MS 503 in Hero. The road continues as CO 24, which continues to MS 513. History Around 1956, MS 504 was designated along a paved road from MS 15 to MS 503. Since then, the route has not changed significantly since. In 1995, a project to seal MS 504's pavement from MS 15 to the Newton‚ÄìJasper county line began.

Life Anna Maria Chetwode was the daughter of Reverend John Chetwode of Glanmire, County Cork, and Elizabeth Chetwode (n√©e Hamilton). She was the granddaughter of Knightley Chetwode, a friend of Jonathan Swift. Miss Chetwode has been identified as Anna Maria by eliminating her parents' other daughters. Reverend John Chetwode wrote poetry, but was never published. He was rector at Rathconey in Glanmire, from 1790 until his death in 1814. Chetwode was still living in Glanmire in 1821. Chetwode travelled to Russia in the early 1800s, staying near Moscow with Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova at her Troitskoe estate. Through the marriage of her sister, Elizabeth Hester, to Robert Wilmot she was connected to his sisters Katherine and Martha. Chetwode wrote at least three novels, though she is believed to have authored more. Her books Blue- stocking Hall (1827) and Tales of my time (1829) were previously incorrectly attributed to a minister in East Anglia, William Pitt Scargill. The Irish antiquarian, John Windele, identifies Chetwode as the author of these books in 1839. Blue-stocking Hall is an epistolary novel set in County Kerry, and advocates for women's education. A book called Snugborough has also been ascribed to Chetwode. A number of Chetwode's poems, noted with her initials, are amongst the Wilmot papers in the Royal Irish Academy. In these papers there is a poem by Chetwode in memory of Thomas Addis Emmet.

TrackMan develops, manufactures and sells sports measurement solutions for both professionals and amateurs. TrackMan‚Äôs main business areas are golf, baseball, American football and soccer. TrackMan products follow the ball flight from the moment of impact to the point where the ball lands or hits an object. The resulting data is displayed on the screen of a connected computer, tablet or smartphone. Depending on the sport, TrackMan products can also measure the club, bat, arm or leg used to strike the ball. All TrackMan products are manufactured in-house and sold through the company itself, either via online inquiries or via the global sales organization. TrackMan 4 - Golf radar  History  TrackMan was founded by brothers Klaus (CEO) and Morten Eldrup- Jorgensen (Chairman of the Board) together with radar engineer Fredrik Tuxen (CTO). Both talented amateur golfers, brothers Klaus and Morten Eldrup- Jorgensen were convinced that technology could make golf practice more fun and rewarding. They teamed up with leading Doppler radar expert Fredrik Tuxen in 2003 to develop the TrackMan unit. The first five TrackMan units were sold in the US to equipment manufacturers Mizuno, Nike, Ping, Callaway and TaylorMade. TrackMan data has been credited for revolutionizing golf practice. Golf fan and multi-billionaire investor Charles Schwab made a short documentary film about TrackMan.  Technology  TrackMan is known in the golf world for its accuracy and the company has a range of patents protecting its products. These include OERT (Optically Enhanced Radar Tracking), which syncs the TrackMan 4‚Äôs inbuilt camera to its Doppler radars in both time and space to improve club and ball speed tracking. All TrackMan technology ‚Äì both hardware and software ‚Äì is custom designed in-house.  Timeline  Products (2020): * TrackMan 3e * TrackMan 4 * TrackMan Range * Baseball Stadium * Baseball B1 * American football * European football (soccer) * Other activitiesTrackMan 3e launch monitor Company overview (2020): * Headquarters in Vedb√¶k, Denmark * Offices in Unites States, Poland, Japan and Korea * Approximately 400 employees Use by pro players: More than 85 out of the world‚Äôs top 100 players own a TrackMan device. TrackMan does not engage in sponsorship agreements so all TrackMan owners have purchased their units.  TrackMan in Golf  Golf continues to be TrackMan‚Äôs core business area. The current physical products are: a permanent installation for driving ranges called TrackMan Range, a mobile unit called TrackMan 4, and the TrackMan Simulator. A product called TrackMan 3e is also available. All data captured from real-life shots is stored in the TrackMan Cloud and by mid-2019 the company could draw on a database of over half a billion shots. TrackMan recently launched Tracy, an AI solution designed to give users one thing to focus on that will improve their game. Tracy is currently part of the TrackMan 4 software package but will be embedded into other TrackMan products in the future. TrackMan Virtual Golf software powered the 2020 BMW Indoor Invitational tournament, which was a collaboration between The European Tour, BMW and TrackMan. The BMW Indoor Invitational was the first-ever virtual golf competition with players from The European Tour and the PGA Tour. TV broadcasters like NBC, CBS and The PGA Tour use TrackMan technology to get accurate data that can be displayed on-screen for viewers at home watching golf.  TrackMan in Baseball  TrackMan started its involvement in baseball in 2008 with a system for equipment manufacturers. In 2009 a stadium system was introduced to supply practice data to the Cardinals, the A‚Äôs and the Padres . By the end of 2011 there was a TrackMan stadium system in all the major league stadiums and the technology was being used in baseball broadcasts from ESPN and Fox . TrackMan and the MLB stopped their collaboration in 2019 but the company still works with the MLB teams. In 2019 TrackMan launched the B1 portable training unit for pitchers and batters. TrackMan currently provides ball data from over 300 stadiums around the world, including more than 80 minor league ballparks in the US, as well as the major stadiums in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. \\\\----  TrackMan in US Football  In 2018 NBC started using TrackMan technology on their Sunday Night Football broadcasts to deliver accurate ball flight data that could be shown using on- screen graphics. A TrackMan system for evaluating and training field goal kickers was introduced in 2019. Later that year, the Chicago Bears became the first NFL team to use the system. \\\\----  TrackMan in European Football  TrackMan is currently developing a unit to measure penalties and free kicks in European football. The unit is due to be released in 2021. Adidas used a TrackMan to measure ball flight and performance in the development of the official 2013 World Cup football.  TrackMan in Other Activities  TrackMan technology is also used in other sports as part of the company‚Äôs R&D; activities. Both the US and the New Zealand Olympic shot put teams used TrackMan to train athletes for the 2016 Olympics. Five out of six shot put medals went to athletes who had trained with TrackMan before the event. US sports equipment manufacturer Wilson used a bespoke TrackMan device to develop their Steam 99S and 105S rackets which were designed to increase ball spin effect. The Steam range was introduced in 2013. \\\\----  References  Category:Radar ","title":"TrackMan"},{"id":"58032627","text":"Alltheniko are an Italian heavy metal band, formed in Vercelli, Italy, in 2002 by Dave Nightfight (vocals and bass), Joe Boneshaker (guitar) and Luke the Idol (drums).

It is located in the municipality of J√ºchen in Rhein-Kreis Neuss, North Rhine-Westphalia, between Grevenbroich and M√∂nchengladbach.  History  The history of the castle began in 1094 when the knight Hermannus de Disco was mentioned in a record of the Archbishop of Cologne as the lord of a simple fortification. Over time the site was converted into a fortified moated castle. In 1383 the castle was besieged by the cities of Aachen and Cologne, as well as by the archbishop Friedrich III von Saarwerden and Duke William I of Guelders and J√ºlich. They accused Lord Gerard van Dyck of being a robber knight. When Gerard van Dyck died without male offspring, the castle was inherited by Johann V von Reifferscheidt, the ancestor of the counts and princes of Salm-Reifferscheid. This family owned the castle for more than 900 years until it became the Centre for Garden Art and Landscape Design in 1999. The last heiress of the family, Countess Marie Christine Wolff Metternic, turned it over to a foundation to secure the future of the castle. The castle is the center of Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck, an independent territory located between the Electorate of Cologne, Guelders and J√ºlich. The small territory was called \\"Dycker L√§ndchen\\" and is still recognizable for its unique cultural landscape.  Description  The main building, the forecourts, and the outbuilding and the stables are spread over four islands. In the 17th century the castle was turned into an early baroque residence. Count Salentin of Salm-Reifferscheid extended the main building into a four-wing complex; stables, watch rooms, and the brewery were renewed. In the 18th century, Schloss Dyck became a Rococo residence, with fine tapestries and exquisite furniture. Unfortunately not everything has been saved: the famous library was sold at an auction in 1992, as was the armory and weapons collection. The complex is surrounded by an English landscape garden created by prince Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck. The castle and the park are open for visitors. The complex also includes a hotel that hosts many venues and meetings. Schloss Dyck Classic Days is a cultural heritage festival started in 2006. Its proceeds are used for the maintenance of the castle.

The radar was operated through a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.  Description  CSU-CHILL is used to study atmospheric principles and precipitation on a small scale with the use of two frequencies. It has a transmitter consisting of both S and X-bands, both using a klystron. Each transmitter can individually transmit its respective frequency through its own feed horn onto the 9m offset parabolic antenna. This configuration also aids in the ability to gather samples from various polarizations. From these, the type of precipitation can be easily discerned. CSU-CHILL is protected by a pneumatic dome, and is close to its control buildings. It is often positioned near Greeley, Colorado, but is semi-mobile, so that it is movable in separate pieces, and can be quickly assembled or disassembled to participate in a field study.

It was opened in 1928 -just 3 miles south of Mogadishu- with the name \\"Enrico Petrella\\" in honor of an Italian pilot who died a few years before in the same airport of Italian Mogadiscio (in 1921, when was a simple airstrip runway). In 1941 the airport was partially destroyed during WW2 and remained inactive for some years as a civilian airport: only military airplanes used it. In 1950 was reopened as a civilian airport by the Italian authorities of the ONU Fiduciary Mandate. History The initial Mogadishu airport was established in 1928 with the name \\"Aeroporto Petrella di Mogadiscio\\", the first such facility to be opened in the Horn of Africa. A \\"Romeo Ro.1\\" airplane used by Squadriglia Mogadiscio, based on Petrella airport It was located nearly 5 km south of Mogadiscio's port: since 1938 a bus service (one of the first in Africa) was connecting the airport with the colonial Italian city and its port. It served as the main military airport serving Italian Somaliland. The \\"36 Squadriglia Mogadiscio\\" was based there since 1926. The airport was the center for Italian air-raids & bombings on southern Ethiopia during the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1935-1936. In 1930 the airport was known worldwide because the pilot Francis Lombardi flew from Rome to Mogadiscio in the same flight, obtaining an aviation record. In the mid-1930s, the airport began offering civilian and commercial flights. A regular Asmara-Assab-Mogadishu commercial route was started in 1935, with an Ala Littoria Caproni 133 providing 13-hour flights from the Mogadishu airport to Italian Eritrea. The aircraft had a maximal capacity of 18 passengers, which at the time was a record. In 1936, Ala Littoria launched an intercontinental connection between Mogadishu-Asmara-Khartoum-Tripoli and Rome. The voyage lasted four days and was one of the first long range flights in the world.Flavio Riccitelli (A.I.D.A.) ALA LITTORIA S.A. (1934‚Äì1941) Ala Littoria's service to East Africa was inaugurated in 1935 under the name Linea dell'Impero. On 7 July 1935 a memorandum of agreement was signed with Imperial Airways, a private British firm, whereby they would carry Ala Littoria passengers from Brindisi in southern Italy as far as Khartoum in the Sudan (via Cairo in Egypt). This was the first leg of Imperial Airways' route from Europe to South Africa. From Khartoum, Ala Littoria's passengers would transfer to its own aircraft and fly on to Kassala (Sudan), Asmara (Eritrea), Massawa (Eritrea), Djibouti (French Somaliland), Berbera (British Somaliland), Bura Galadi (British Kenya) and Mogadishu (Italian Somaliland). Full passenger service from Rome to Mogadishu opened in November 1935. By March 1937, service had been added to Gorrahei (Ethiopia) and Beledweyne (Somalia).Caprotti, \\"Fascist Civil Aviation\\", pp. 23‚Äì25. In 1939 the Petrella airport was started to be enlarged and linked to other minor airports inside the Italian East Africa (called \\"Rete AOI\\"), but the beginning of WWII blocked the works. During the East African Campaign the airport was greatly damaged. The East African network (Rete A.O.I.) at the end of the Imperial Line Originally a mid-sized airport, the facility grew considerably in size in the post- independence period of Somalia after numerous successive renovation projects. Actually it has been greatly improved and it is called the Mogadishu international airport.

An immigrant to Canada, Holer is most notable for founding Marineland of Canada in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. He founded the park in the early 1960s and managed it until his death in 2018. Holer was born in ≈Ωice, a village in Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia. His family were farmers and vintners in a wine region. Holer himself studied the chemistry of wine in technical school. After the Second World War, when Communists expropriated part of the family farm, Holer escaped across the border into Graz, Austria. He worked at a winery before travelling to Germany, where he gained employment with Circus Krone and learned to train animals. Holer immigrated to Canada in 1957, settling in the Niagara area. Holer worked at various jobs, including at the Canada Steamship Lines dry dock at Welland, Ontario. Observing a damaged submarine at the dry dock, Holer and a partner devised an idea for an underwater submarine ride, plans of which they sold to The Walt Disney Company for . Using some of the proceeds, Holer, with a partner, bought part of the Harry Oakes estate in Niagara Falls on which to build an animal attraction for Niagara tourists, doing some of the building himself. The \\"Marine Wonderland and Animal Farm\\" opened in 1961. Holer had welded two large steel tanks together and brought in three sea lions and charged one quarter for admission and another to feed the animals. The attraction also featured an underwater show featuring two female swimmers. Holer owned and supervised Marineland of Canada, as it was later named, until his death in 2018. Holer was known to ride around the park in a golf cart, personally supervising. Marineland expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, adding marine mammals (orcas, belugas and dolphins ), land animals and large rides, including a large roller coaster and tower drop ride. The park's keeping of marine mammals attracted the attention of animal activists, opposed to the keeping of the animals in captivity, who would protest outside the park's gates. In the 2010s, the park was investigated several times for animal cruelty. Through it all, Holer insisted that his animals were well taken care of, and initiated lawsuits against former employees, activists and the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Holer died on June 23, 2018, aged 82. He was praised as an \\"immigrant success story\\" by Senator Don Plett (Manitoba). Holer had been seriously ill for five months, and died at his home on Chippawa Parkway. Holer was survived by his wife of 46 years, Marie and son Peter. Another son, John Mark Jr., died in 2013. He was interred at Fairview Cemetery. Marineland is now run by 'Holer Family Amusements', a company founded by his family after he died.

The film was produced by Scott Hamilton Kennedy and Trace Sheehan. Narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, Food Evolution tackles the schism that has arisen between scientists and consumers over how to feed our expanding population safely and sustainably.  Synopsis  Food Evolution follows the controversy surrounding GMOs and food. Traveling from Hawaiian papaya groves, to banana farms in Uganda to the cornfields of Iowa, the film discusses the emotions and the science behind food production. It advocates for and against GMOs as they each claim science is on their side. It also follows specific cases amongst local legislation within the United States and in Africa, addressing how misinformation and fear can overwhelm objective analysis. Topics in the film range from: food safety, environmental protection, population demand, pesticide use, and general health surrounding GMOs. Through each topic, the film analyzes what data, evidence and sources are being used to argue one way or the other. People featured in the film, in order of appearance, include Margaret Wille, Jeffrey Smith, Charles Benbrook, Dennis Gonsalves, Alison Van Eenennaam, Pamela Ronald, Nathanael Johnson, Emma Naluyima, Mark Lynas, Zen Honeycut, and Raoul Adamchak. It also features interviews from Michael Pollan, Andrew Kimbrell, Vandana Shiva, Robert Fraley, Marion Nestle and Bill Nye, as well as farmers and scientists from around the world.

The altarpiece was commissioned by wealthy Spanish traders as the high altarpiece for the monastic church of Santa Maria la Real in N√°jera. Only three panels of the original altarpiece survive. In the nineteenth century they were acquired by the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp, where they are now exhibited. These panels have been described as an avant-garde work in Renaissance decorative art.Fierens-Gevaert, 1908,  Historical context  The altarpiece was commissioned in 1487 by the consuls of the Spanish merchants in Bruges, Pedro and Antonio de N√°jera, to decorate the organ of the Santa Mar√≠a la Real of N√°jera, the former pantheon of the kings of Navarre. Some of the ornaments of the 17 (larger-than-life) figures depicted bear the arms of Castile and Le√≥n. The original altarpiece was huge, and the three surviving paintings were likely part of its upper tier. The central panel depicted the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. This is a rare work in which Christ is depicted surrounded by angelic musicians. Alcoy, 2004, p. 22 After having been abandoned for four centuries, it was bought in 1885 by an art dealer and sold to the Belgian government, which entrusted it to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Antwerp. Quintanilla , 2007, An extensive restoration campaign began in 2001. It took a total of 16 years, due partly to the huge surface area of the work and the complex nature of the treatment.  Composition  The three panels The Christ surrounded by angels stands against a golden background surrounded by black clouds. On his collar are the words Agyos Otheos (Holy God). The three precious stones which adorn the fibula of his mantle evoke the Holy Trinity: God the Father, God the Son and the Holy Spirit. With his crown and his crystal ball surmounted by a cross, he reigns over the Christian kingdom, both celestial and terrestrial. He is flanked by sixteen angels who sing (6) and play music (10). Their instruments are typical of the fifteenth century. The scene was possibly inspired by the passage from the Gospel according to Matthew, which mentions: \\"When the Son of man comes in his glory, accompanied by all the angels, then he will sit on his throne of glory\\" ( Matthew 25: 31-46). The central panel represents Christ blessing and looking down in the direction of the Virgin Mary, his mother, with three angels on either side. Each group of angels holds a large songbook. On the two side shutters, angels play musical instruments, five on each side. In the left panel the instruments are, from left to right, a psaltery, a tromba marina, a lute, a trumpet and a shawm. In the right panel, from left to right, there are a straight trumpet, a looped trumpet, a portative organ, a harp and a fiddle. The panels are 170 cm (5'6\\") high, thus the angels, or what we can see of them (the clouds obscure the part of their body below the knee), are life-size. Many replicas of these panels have been produced. Montagu, 2007, References = Sources and bibliography= * Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert, Les primitifs flamands, Ver.

The film follows a CIA agent who finds himself at the mercy of a precocious nine-year-old girl of a family that he and his tech support are surveilling while undercover. My Spy was first released theatrically on January 9, 2020 in Australia by STX Entertainment. On April 8, 2020, the distribution rights for the film were purchased by Amazon Studios due to the COVID-19 pandemic having shut down theaters worldwide. The film was then released digitally on Prime Video and in select U.S. theatres on June 26, 2020. It received mixed reviews from critics. Plot JJ is a former US Special Forces soldier newly hired as a CIA operative. However, JJ's lack of subtlety causes him to blow his first major mission: busting an illegal weapons-grade plutonium trade between the Russian mafia and Hassan, a Middle East terrorist. Despite this, his boss David Kim assigns him and tech operator Bobbi, who hero-worships JJ, to keep an eye on the in-law family of Victor Marquez, a French illegal arms dealer who has obtained construction plans for a miniaturized nuclear bomb which he intends to sell to Hassan. Victor lost these plans to his brother David, who hid them before he was murdered by Victor; Kim suspects that the plans may be in the possession of David's American wife Kate and their 9-year-old daughter Sophie, who moved from France back to Wicker Park, Chicago, after David's demise. JJ and Bobbi move into the building where Kate and Sophie live, and set up their surveillance. However, Sophie soon finds one of their hidden cameras, backtracks its signal and stumbles upon the operation post. Confronting JJ and Bobbi, she blackmails JJ into keeping her company while she tries to fit into an American kid's life and make some new friends at her school Oaktree Charter School. Despite JJ's social awkwardness, the two slowly begin to bond, and JJ also becomes acquainted with Kate and her neighbors Carlos and Todd. Sophie has JJ train her in the basics of the espionage trade, and brings him and her mother closer together. However, Kim eventually finds out about JJ's personal involvement with his targets and takes him and Bobbi off the mission. JJ reveals his assignment to Kate, who rejects him in disgust. At the same time, Victor discovers and counteracts the CIA's surveillance and coerces his lawyer Koll into revealing where David might have hidden the plans. After faking his own death, he travels to Chicago, confronts Kate, JJ and Sophie and retrieves the plans. Carlos and Todd burst in and intervene, revealing themselves as independent arms dealers who are also after the plans. Bobbi's clumsy attempt to help results in Victor escaping with the plans and Sophie as his hostage. JJ and Kate pursue Victor to an airfield in Naperville, where JJ grounds Victor's escape plane and starts a fistfight with him. In her attempt to escape, Sophie accidentally sets the plane in motion, leaving it hanging at the edge of a cliff on some wire fencing. Victor forces Sophie, who has hidden the real plans, to surrender them. Before he can shoot them, Kate clubs him onto the fence and JJ pushes the plane off the cliff, sending Victor to his death. After being reinstated by Kim for his success, JJ has himself permanently assigned to Chicago, where he moves in with Kate and Sophie.

On October 5, 2017, it was reported that STX Entertainment had finalized a deal to develop a then-untitled action-comedy film starring Dave Bautista. Bautista was also expected to produce the film, alongside Jonathan Meisner, with Drew Simon overseeing the project for the studio. On July 30, 2018, it was announced that the first film in the planned series, now titled My Spy, would be directed by Peter Segal from a screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber. In October 2018, it was announced that Ken Jeong, Parisa Fitz- Henley, Chloe Coleman, and Kristen Schaal had joined the cast of the film. It was further announced that Segal, Chris Bender, Jake Weiner, and Gigi Pritzker would serve as producers for the film, that the Hoebers, Michael Flynn, Rachel Shane, and Adrian Alperovich would serve as executive producers, and that Stacy Calabrese would serve as a co-producer. Additionally, it was reported that MWM Studios had joined the film as an additional production company. Principal photography for the film commenced on October 15, 2018 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and concluded on November 30, 2018. Release The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on August 23, 2019, but it was pushed back to an undisclosed 2020 date on July 10, 2019. After then being set for a January release and moved, it was pushed back yet again on March 7 (just a week before its scheduled March 13 release) to April 17, but the domestic theatrical release was then cancelled due to movie theater closures since mid- March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. On April 8, 2020, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was released digitally on Prime Video, as well as in select Cineplex Entertainment, Landmark Cinemas, and drive-in theaters, on June 26, 2020. It made an estimated $107,000 from 104 theaters in its second weekend of domestic release (for a North American running total of $307,000). It was released on January 9, 2020 in Australia. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the film was released in the UK on March 13, 2020 without any alteration. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"My Spy plugs Dave Bautista into the 'charismatic action star meets cute kid' formula, with generally painless albeit decidedly mediocre results.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Ben Travis of Empire magazine gave the film 2 out of 5, and wrote: \\"This big-spy-meets-little-kid comedy isn't funny enough for teens, but not really suitable for younger viewers either.\\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C‚Äì\\" and wrote: \\"Saddled with a baffling PG-13 rating ‚Äî the film's violence is muted, but a decision was made to throw in frequent profanity, plus the repetitive use of an un-edited version of Cardi B's 'Bodak Yellow' ‚Äî My Spy seems destined to both alienate kids and turn off adults.\\" Writing for Variety, Richard Kuipers called it a \\"mildly amusing family comedy\\" and said that Segal \\"generates an amiable atmosphere in domestic scenes and gets solid performances from a cast that's given some good and some not-so-good material to work with.\\" Possible sequel In August 2020, it was announced that Amazon and STX were in discussions for a sequel, with the intention of Segal and the cast all returning.

He operated a personal sculpture park in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, where he also lived and worked. At age 79, Dayton had a piece‚Äîa 1968 stainless steel work entitled Crescent‚Äîacquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) for its permanent collection. At 80, he had a six-decade survey of his work shown at the Blum & Poe gallery in Los Angeles.  Early life and work  Dayton was born in Spokane, Washington, in 1938. He had an early interest in becoming a sign painter but went to Indiana University to study art, earning a B.F.A. in 1960. After graduating, Dayton hitchhiked to New York City, where he lived for 12 years, making a living as a guard at the Whitney Museum and as a maintenance painter at the Museum of Modern Art. Though not directly affiliated with any of the dominant movements in the New York art world at the time‚Äîsuch as Abstract Expressionism and Pop‚Äîhe met and worked with many of those artists and was friendly with sculptors of the Park Place Group. After initially working as a figurative painter, Dayton transitioned to assemblage and sculpture and began working with salvaged, junkyard materials like steel drums and tin cans.  Los Angeles  Dayton left New York for Los Angeles in 1972, settling in the Silver Lake area of the city. He worked as a carpenter to support his family as he pursued his art, without much commercial success. In 1999, he moved to a home on a two-acre plot in a rural part of LA's San Fernando Valley, which gave him the space to pursue more large-scale sculptural works. Dayton has continued to exhibit his works, when not picked up by galleries, in the self-made, two-acre sculpture park on his property that's been said to be reminiscent of the ranch of artist Jirayr Zorthian. While he has continued to incorporate a variety of materials in his sculptures, Dayton's later work has focused on large-scale pieces in stainless steel, often salvaged from landfills. Dayton's late-in-life break came after art collector and former co-founder of Creative Artists Agency (CAA) Michael Ovitz visited his studio. Ovitz recommended his work to Blum & Poe gallery co- founder Tim Blum and LACMA director Michael Govan. Soon after, LACMA acquired Dayton's 1968 stainless steel sculpture, Crescent, for the museum's permanent collection, and Blum & Poe mounted a full-gallery career retrospective of Dayton's work, showcasing 58 pieces spanning 1964‚Äì2018. Dayton died in 2019. He was 81. Blum & Poe said of his work at the time: > \\"Shapes cut from steel, spliced curling metal pipes, and the parts of a > dismembered drill press met in totemic compositions, effortlessly rising > from the ground toward the sky. Dayton transmuted these crude mediums into > graceful abstracted forms, welded gestures representing the birth of a > child, lovers lost, and the celestial bodies above.\\"  References  Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Spokane, Washington Category:Sculptors from Washington (state) Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:21st-century American sculptors Category:21st-century male artists Category:People from Silver Lake, Los Angeles Category:Artists from New York City Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Sculptors from New York (state) Category:Sculptors from California ","title":"Wendell Dayton"},{"id":"58033114","text":"The 2018 First Responder Bowl was a college football bowl game scheduled for December 26, 2018, at the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas. It was one of the 2018‚Äì19 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by Servpro, a franchisor of fire and water cleanup and restoration, the game was officially known as the Servpro First Responder Bowl. The ninth overall staging of the bowl, this was the first edition since being rebranded; its prior six editions were the Heart of Dallas Bowl, preceded by the TicketCity Bowl in its first two stagings. The game was delayed in the first quarter, after Boston College took a 7‚Äì0 lead, and went into a weather delay due to lightning. Repeated lightning strikes near the stadium forced further delays; under NCAA rules, any lightning within eight miles of a stadium triggers a mandatory 30-minute delay, and the delay is extended with additional strikes. The game was cancelled about two hours later amid forecasts that the severe weather would continue throughout the day and night. The game is considered a no-contest for the teams involved. This is believed to be the first postseason game at the FBS-level (or its predecessors) that was cancelled due to weather. NCAA records reflect only two prior postseason cancellations‚Äîa 1941 charity game between San Jose State and Hawaii that was cancelled following the attack on Pearl Harbor; and a 2013 Division II game, the C.H.A.M.P.S.

It can hold around 28,000 worshippers. View on Fujairah Beach looking out to sea On the seafront are Fujairah Corniche and Fujairah International Marine Club on Al Corniche Road. There is also bull fighting on Friday afternoons. To the north is Fujairah Beach on Al Faseel Road. Most major hotels are on or close to Hamad Bin Abdulla Road and Al Corniche Road. Transportation The Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Expressway (aka Sheikh Khalifa Highway), a dual carriageway road, links Fujairah City with Dubai and other parts of the UAE, passing through the mountains just inland from the city. This leads into Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, which continues through the city to the coast. The main airport in the emirate, Fujairah International Airport, is located to the south of Fujairah City. It currently only handles cargo traffic.

There are four such castes, all having different ritual and social status within the caste system of Maharashtra. They are Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu, Pathare Prabhu, Kanchole Prabhus, Bhatt Prabhus and the Danved Prabhu. Introduction The Prabhu communities are subdivided into many castes. * Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (popularly known as CKP) * Pathare Prabhu * Bhatt Prabhu *Drauv Prabhu also known as Kanchole Prabhus or Pathare Prabhu Kanchole * Danved Prabhu Some sources refer to them by their full name but some are ambiguous as to which specific Prabhu community they are referring to. In other sources, context can be used to identify the specific caste. In some sources, Pathare Prabhus and CKPs have been jointly referred to as Prabhu Communities. Details =Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) and Pathare Prabhu= The CKP are considered superior to the other Prabhu communities. They are a ritually high caste and are considered socially proximate to Maharashtrian Brahmin community. Along with the Saraswat, Deshastha and Chitpawan they have been considered as an \\"advanced caste\\" due to similarities in education and occupational status. The Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) and Pathare Prabhu are considered intellectual classes (other than Brahmins) and have been advanced in education. Both have vedic upanayana (thread ceremonies or 'munj' in marathi) and their 'vedokta' or rights to study of Vedas and perform Vedic rituals has been formally approved by the Brahmin councils and ratified by the Shankaracharyas based on shastras. In case of Pathare Prabhus the formal approval was given by the Shankaracharya of Shingeri and in the case of CKPs by Brahmin councils of Pune, Banares, Bajirao II and the Shankaracharya of Karvir and Sanakareshwar Math (a Deshastha Brahmin). =Kanchole Prabhus= The Drauv (or Dhurus) are also known as Kanchole Prabhus. It is said that they were part of the Pathare Prabhu community but were excommunicated for disobeying caste rules. The Kacholes made several attempts and appeals to the Pathare Prabhu caste to accept them back. The first was made in 1836, the second and third in 1881. In November 1881, 38 gentlemen from the Pathare Prabhu community confirmed the Kanchole's \\"purity of blood\\", similar religious beliefs, similar gotras and characteristics and professions, similarity in writings, status etc. Despite these proofs they were not readmitted due to rigid 19th century rules regarding caste pollution. =Communities claiming Prabhu status= The Somavanshi Kshatriya Pathare (SKP) - also known as \\"Panchkalshi\\" claim that they were once part of the Pathare Prabhu however the Pathare Prabhus dismiss this claim and do not accept them as equals.

Its precise date is still under discussion. It was taken to France very early in its lifespan and formed a major influence on late medieval French artists. It is now split between the Louvre, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp and the Gem√§ldegalerie. On the back of the Louvre panel (Christ Bearing the Cross) is the coat of arms of the Louvre. It shows the man who commissioned the painting dressed as a cardinal at the foot of the cross. Some art historians see him as a portrait of the Roman cardinal Napoleone Orsini, who owned a fragment of the True Cross, which may explain the choice of subject. Under this hypothesis, he commissioned it before leaving Rome for the papal court in Avignon or in Avignon itself, where Martini followed Orsini.Victor Schmidt, opcit It was probably in the Champmol Charterhouse, near Dijon, by the end of the 14th century. It was still there in the prior's chambers in 1791, when it was sold and split up. The four panels in Antwerp (Crucifixion, Descent from the Cross, The Archangel Gabriel and Virgin of the Annunciation) were sold in Dijon in 1822 and acquired for the collection of Florent van Ertborn, mayor of Antwerp - they were originally two panels, with Gabriel and Virgin on the reverse of the other two panels, before they were later sawn off. The Louvre panel (Christ Bearing the Cross) was bought from a man named L. Saint-Denis in 1834 by Louis Philippe I. The Berlin panel (Entombment) was bought from the Paris art dealer √âmile Pacully in 1901 . Reconstruction When open, the altarpiece had four scenes of Christ's Passion on one side and two reverse panels on the other. When closed, it showed Christ Bearing the Cross with the now-lost Berlin panel on the reverse.Louvre catalogue entry Image:Simone Martini 067.jpgChrist Bearing the Cross Image:Simone Martini 066.jpgCrucifixion.

SDHAF1 is a chaperone protein involved in the assembly of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex (complex II). Mutations in this gene are associated with SDH-defective infantile leukoencephalopathy and mitochondrial complex II deficiency.  Structure  SDHAF1 is located on the q arm of chromosome 19 in position 13.12 and has 1 exon. The SDHAF1 gene produces a 12.8 kDa protein composed of 115 amino acids. SDHAF1 is ubiquitously expressed and belongs to the complex I LYR family and SDHAF1 subfamily. As such, SDHAF1 is one of at least eight proteins that has a LYR tripeptide motif, thought to be important for Fe-S metabolism. SDHAF1 also contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that does not get cleaved following import into the mitochondria. The encoded protein is fairly hydrophilic and does not contain a transmembrane domain.  Function  SDHAF1 is essential for the assembly of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex (complex II), an enzyme complex that is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol. The succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of 4 individual subunits. The protein encoded by the SDHAF1 gene resides in the mitochondria, and is essential for SDH assembly, but does not physically associate with the complex in vivo. Specifically, SDHAF1 mediates and promotes the maturation of the SDHB subunit of the SDH catalytic dimer. The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein subunit SDHB is required for functional succinate dehydrogenase. By protecting SDHB from damaging oxidants, SDHAF1 plays a vital role in the assembly and stability of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Alternatively, SDHAF1 may facilitate Fe-S cluster acquisition by SDHB by directly binding to the co- chaperone HSC20, which is an essential component of the Fe-S biogenesis machinery that facilitates transfer of the Fe-S prosthetic group from the main scaffold protein ISCU to recipient apo-proteins (i.e. SDHB),  Clinical Significance  Variants of SDHAF1 have been associated with mitochondrial complex II deficiency and infantile leukoencephalopathy. Mitochondrial complex II deficiency is a disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Clinical features include psychomotor regression in infants, poor growth with lack of speech development, severe spastic quadriplegia, dystonia, progressive leukoencephalopathy, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and cardiomyopathy. Some patients manifest Leigh syndrome or Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Missense mutations c.164 G > C, p.Arg55Pro and c.170 G > A, p.Gly57Glu, homozygous transversion 169G-C, p. Gly57-Arg, homozygous non sense mutation c.103G>T (p.Glu35X), and homozygous nonsense mutation c.22C > T, p.Gln8X have been associated with mitochondrial complex II deficiency due to SDHAF1 disfunction.  Interactions  SDHAF1 has 27 protein-protein interactions with 15 of them being co-complex interactions. HSCB, SDHB, ccdc136, KRT27, CIDEB, HSPA9, and ISCU have all been found to interact with SDHAF1.

Kern was an active member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and a law suit she filed for an inmate led to El Paso County to construct a new jail with better conditions for inmates.  Biography  Kern was born in Chicago to Swedish immigrants and grew up poor in the South Side. and Kern raised her family and attended college and university classes part-time at the University of Chicago and the Chicago Kent College of Law. At the college of law, she was the only woman in her class and she earned the Kappa Beta Pi Honor Key. She was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1946. She started working first as a legal editor for the Commerce Clearing House Association and was about to go into private practice when her son's health prompted a move to El Paso, Texas in 1947.

Kern had to take the job as a secretary because she had trouble getting hired as a lawyer. and Kern worked as a housewife and did civic work for the next fifteen years before she decided to go back into law. In 1966, she divorced her second husband. Kern was admitted to the Texas state bar in 1967. and She started her own private practice in 1968, since law firms weren't hiring many women in the city. She was the only woman doing full-time private practice in El Paso at the time. Her practice was known as Kern & Rosen and Kern took care of family law, while her partner, Stanley Rosen worked on business law. Kern also taught classes part-time at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) for three years until her law practice grew too busy. Kern was a member and served as president of the El Paso chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Kern often took on indigent defense cases. One, filed around 1975 sued El Paso County due to the poor conditions in the jail. This lawsuit led to the construction of a new jail. She also defended conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. In 1974, the El Paso Women's Political Caucus (EPWPC) endorsed Kern for the position of judge at the Court of Domestic Relations in El Paso, which she lost to Enrique Pena after a \\"hard fight.\\" Kern was also a very outspoken feminist and brought issues like rape and women's rights to the forefront of public discussion. Kern used her own experiences to dismiss myths about rape. and She also served as vice chair of a shelter for women facing domestic violence, the Transitional Living Center, which she co-founded in 1977. Kern also co-founded and served as the first president of the El Paso Women's Bar Association. In 1993, Kern was inducted into the El Paso Women's Hall of Fame.

Ardee Castle is the largest fortified medieval Tower House in Ireland or Britain. The castle was originally built by Roger de Peppard in 1207, but not much is left from the original walls.  The castle  The rectangular building stands four storeys high. with turrets situated at the north-west and south-west angles, the main entrance was protected by a machicolation on the outside, with a 'murder-hole' on the interior. The ground floor has a rounded barrel vault, and access to the upper storeys is by means of a stairway in the north-west turret. As the structure has been in continuous use, most of the windows have been replaced and modernized over time, however a twin-light ogee-arched window survives at ground level and three single looped, internal splay windows survive on the fourth floor.  History  St. Leger's Castle was built in the 15th century by John St. Leger and it served as a stronghold for the defense of the Pale. Over the years it was fought over by the O‚ÄôNeills and the English and was even used by James II as his headquarters prior to the Battle of the Boyne. In 1641 Sir Phelim O‚ÄôNeil took possession of the town and set up the Irish Army headquarters, but on the retreat the town and castle were retaken by the English Forces under the command of Sir Henry Tichborne, a garrison was then placed and O'Neil's rearguard was defeated.

That mulitingual nature was prominent on the cover with the name of the magazine in two languages, similar to how another popular Shanghai magazine, The Young Companion, would manage their cover. Content included art, literature, and politics. Like Liangyou, it included pictures of urban women's lives, which has proven useful in studying the Republic of China.

Developed countries with modern, secular educational facilities in the post- World War II era have shifted towards post-Christian, secular, globalized, multicultural and multifaith societies. Infant baptism has declined in many nations, with thousands of churches closing or merging due to lack of attendees. There is also evidence of decline in North America (especially in Canada) and in Australia. Despite the decline, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world, where 70% of the population is Christian. In addition, according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, within the next four decades, Christianity will remain the world's largest religion.The Future of World Religions p.8 Table: Size and Projected Growth of Major Religious Groups Overview This is due to the birthrate of Christians and due to Christian evangelism (Christians have 2.7 children per woman, which is above the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman). Background Scholars have proposed that Church institutions decline in power and prominence in most industrialized societies, except in cases in which religion serves some function in society beyond merely regulating the relationship between individuals and God. Reports are mixed on the extent and rate of the decline of Christianity. A 2015 analysis of the European Values Study in the Handbook of Children and Youth Studies identified a \\"dramatic decline\\" in religious affiliation across Europe from 1981 to 2008. However, Christianity is still the largest religion in Western Europe, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center, where 71% of Western Europeans identified themselves as Christian. According to the same study, 83% of those who were raised as Christians still identify as such. The European Values Study found that in most European countries in 2008, the majority of young respondents identified themselves as Christians. Unlike Western Europe, in Central and Eastern European countries the proportion of Christians has been stable or even increased in the post-communist era. In 2017, a report released by St. Mary's University, London concluded that Christianity \\"as a norm\\" was gone for at least the foreseeable future. According to the report, 91% of people in the Czech Republic between the ages of 16 to 29 have not declared a religious affiliation, and in the United Kingdom, only 7% identify as Anglican (compared to 6% who identify as Muslim). In at least 12 out of the 29 European countries surveyed by the researchers, based on a sample of 629, the majority of young adults reported that they were not religious. By 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion. By 2050, Christianity is expected to remain the majority of population and the largest religious group in Latin America and Caribbean (89%), North America (66%), Europe (65.2%) and Sub Saharan Africa (59%). According to Mark J√ºrgensmeyer of the University of California, popular Protestantism is one of the most dynamic religious movements in the contemporary world. Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant.Hillerbrand, Hans J., \\"Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set\\", p. 1815, \\"Observers carefully comparing all these figures in the total context will have observed the even more startling finding that for the first itime ever in the history of Protestantism, Wider Protestants will by 2050 have become almost exactly as numerous as Roman Catholics ‚Äì each with just over 1.5 billion followers, or 17 percent of the world, with Protestants growing considerably faster than Catholics each year.\\" Since 1900, due primarily to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania, the Muslim World and Latin America. The significant growth of Christianity in non-Western countries led to regional distribution changes of Christians. Evidence of decline by country =Australia= In the 2016 Census, just over 30% declared that they had no religion. Also, in a 2017 survey of teenage Australians aged 13-18, 52% declared that they had no religion, compared with 38% Christian, 3% Islam, 2% Buddhist and 1% Hindu.{{cite web url=https://www.abc.net.au/religion/religion-in-australia- what-are-the-implications-of-none-being-th/10094576 title=Religion in Australia: What are the Implications of 'None' being the New Normal?author=Gary Boumadate=28 June 2018 website=ABC Religion & Ethics publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation access-date=16 September 2020 =Canada= In Quebec, since the Quiet Revolution, over 500 churches (20% of the total) have been closed or converted for non-worship based uses. In the 1950s, 95% of Quebec's population went to mass; in the present day, that number is closer to 5%. Despite the decline in church attendance, Christianity remains the dominant religion in Quebec, where 82.2% of people were Christians, according to 2011 National Household Survey. = Chile = Cases of sexual abuse, attempt to hide information, and interference of the Catholic Church in government matters have been the main causes of the decline of Catholic Christianity in Chile. According to the public broadcaster TVN, the number of Chileans who declare themselves Catholics fell from 73% in 2008 to 45% in 2018. In addition, it is the Latin American country that has less trust (36%) in the Church throughout the region according to Latinobar√≥metro. 63% of the Chilean population profess some branch of Christianity, according to the Encuesta Nacional Bicentenario identifies as Christian, with an estimated 45% of Chileans declaring to be part of the Catholic Church and 18% of Protestant or Evangelical churches. 5% of the population adheres to other religion. Attempts to restore the Roman Catholic Christian faith in Chile have failed. The Argentine newspaper Clar√≠n reported that Pope Francis's State visit to Chile in 2018 \\"had been the worst in his five years of pontificate.\\" After the papal visit, the crisis in the Chilean Catholic Church increased. According to the Bicentenario survey, atheism has grown from 21% in 2018 to 32% in 2019. =Ireland= Christianity, specifically Catholicism, remains the dominant religion in the Republic of Ireland. In the 2016 census, 85.1% of the population identified as Christian. ; However recent social changes, including the lifting of a ban on abortion and the legalising same sex marriage, have solidified the growth of liberal thinking in Ireland, particularly within the younger community. An Irish priest, Fr. Kevin Hegarty, asserted in 2018 that the church's authority was undermined by the papal encyclical, called Humanae Vitae, that established the Church's opposition to contraception. He reported that there is only one priest under the age of 40 in the entire diocese of Killala; only two priests have been ordained over the last 17 years, and there have been no candidates for the priesthood since 2013. Hegarty blames this decline on the Church's positions on female ordination, contraception and sexuality. A continued requirement for children entering Irish Catholic owned schools to be baptized keeps the overall level of baptisms high, though the number of individuals practicing a faith or attending church is at an all-time low and rapidly decreasing. =Netherlands= Starting in 1880 and accelerating after the Second World War, the major religions began to decline among the Dutch, while Islam began to increase.Hans Knippenberg, \\"Secularization in the Netherlands in its historical and geographical dimensions,\\" GeoJournal (1998) 45#3 pp 209-220. onlineTom√°≈° Sobotka and Feray Adig√ºzel, \\"Religiosity and spatial demographic differences in the Netherlands\\" (2002) online During the 1960s and 1970s, pillarization began to weaken and the population became less religious. In 1971, 39% of the Dutch population were members of the Roman Catholic Church; by 2014, their share of the population had dropped to 23.3% (church-reported KASKI data), or to 23.7% (large sample survey by Statistics Netherlands in 2015). The proportion of adherents of Calvinism and Methodism declined in the same period from 31% to 15.5%. With only 49.9% of the Dutch currently (2015) adhering to a religion, the Netherlands is one of the least religious countries of the European Union, after the Czech Republic and Estonia. By the 1980s, religion had largely lost its influence on Dutch politics and as a result Dutch policy on women's rights, abortion, euthanasia, homosexuality and prostitution became very liberal in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of the decline, the two major strands of Calvinism, the Dutch Reformed Church and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, together with a small Lutheran group, began to cooperate as the Samen op weg Kerken (\\"Together on the road churches\\"). In 2004 these groups merged to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. In 2015, Statistics Netherlands found that 50.1% of the adult population declared themselves non-religious. Christians comprised 43.8% of the total population, of whom 23.7% were Catholics; 15.5% Protestants; and 4.6% members of other Christian denominations. Followers of Islam comprised 4.9% of the total population, Hinduism 0.6%, Buddhism 0.4% and Judaism 0.1%. The proportion of the population following Islam has increased, primarily via immigration. In the early 21st century, religious tensions between native Dutch people and migrant Muslims was increasing. After the rise of politician Pim Fortuyn, who sought to defend the Dutch liberal culture against what he saw as a \\"backwards religion\\", Fortuyn: grens dicht voor islamiet, Volkskrant, 2002-02-09 stricter immigration laws were enacted. Religious tensions increased after the murder of Pim Fortuyn in 2002, as well as the 2004 assassination of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri, a conservative Muslim. In December 2014, for the first time, there are more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. Currently the majority of the Dutch population is agnostic (31%) or spiritual but not religious (27%). In 2015, 63% of Dutch people think that religion does more harm than good. A quarter of the population thinks that morality is threatened if no one believes in God, down from 40% in 2006. The number of people reporting that they never pray rose from 36% in 2006 to 53% in 2016. =Spain and Italy= Adherence to established forms of church-related worship is in rapid decline in Spain and Italy, and Church authority on social, moral and ethical issues has been reduced. In 2017, the PBS News Hour reported that Sevilles historic cloistered convents were suffering from Christianity's decline in Spain. Despite the decline of daily attendance and the church's authority, Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spain and Italy. According to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research, 68.3% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholic in 2019, The question was \\"¬øC√≥mo se define Ud. en materia religiosa: cat√≥lico/a, creyente de otra religi√≥n, no creyente o ateo/a?\\" and according to Pew Research Center, 83.3% of Italy's residents are Christians. =United Kingdom= Attendance at Anglican churches had begun to decline in the UK by the Edwardian era, with both membership in mainstream churches and attendance at Sunday schools declining. Infant baptism declined after World War II. In 2014, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams stated that the UK had become a \\"post-Christian country.\\" In 2014, only 4.3% of the population participated in a Church of England Christmas service. Nevertheless, around 60% of all respondents identified as Christians in the 2011 Census. =United States= Christianity is the largest religion in the United States. Christians represented 73.7% of the total population in 2016 and 65% in 2019. Meanwhile, those who identified as \\"no religion\\" or \\"unaffiliated\\" rose to 26% of the total population. Nationwide Catholic membership increased between 2000 and 2017, but the number of churches declined by nearly 11% and by 2019, the number of Catholics decreased by 2 million people. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) lost about 30% of its congregation and closed 12.5% of its churches: the United Methodist church lost 16.7% of its congregation and 10.2% of its churches. The Presbyterian Church has had the sharpest decline in church membership: between 2000 and 2015 they lost over 40% of their congregation and 15.4% of their churches. Infant baptism has also decreased; nationwide, Catholic baptisms are down by nearly 34%, and ELCA baptisms by over 40%. In 2018, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that churches in Minnesota were being closed due to dwindling attendance. Mainline protestant churches in Minnesota have seen the sharpest declines in their congregations. The Catholic Church has closed 81 churches between 2000 and 2017; the Archdiocese of Minneapolis closed 21 churches in 2010 and has had to merge dozens more. In roughly the same time frame, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Minnesota has lost 200,000 members and closed 150 churches. The United Methodist Church, which is Minnesota's second-largest Protestant denomination, has closed 65 of its churches. In the early 1990s, the Archdiocese of Chicago closed almost 40 Catholic churches and schools. In 2016, increasing costs and priest shortages fueled plans to close or consolidate up to 100 Chicago Catholic churches and schools in the next 15 years. The Archdiocese of New York announced in 2014 that nearly 1/3 of their churches were merging and closing., The Archdiocese of Boston closed more than 70 churches between 2004‚Äì2019. Moderate and liberal denominations in the United States have been closing down churches at a rate three or four times greater than the number of new churches being consecrated. However, according to The Christian Century, the rate of annual closures is approximately 1% and quite low relative to other types of institutions. It has been asserted that of the approximately 3,700 churches that close each year, up to half are unsuccessful new churches. Denominations like Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Pentecostals and Eastern Orthodox had slight increases in membership between 2003 and 2018 but the number of adults in the United States who do not report any religious affiliation nearly doubled over that period. In 2017, Schnabel and Bock argued that while \\"moderate religion\\" has declined in the United States since the late 1980s, \\"intense religion\\" including evangelicalism has persisted.

He was manager and chief glassmaker of James Powell and Sons from 1875 to 1919. He is best known for his innovations in the production of vessel glass, his contributions of new, medieval-like glass to the Arts and Crafts Movement, and the invention of innovative glass materials designed for the war effort during World War I. Biography Harry James Powell was the grandson of James Powell, founder of James Powell and Sons Glass Company (originally known as Whitefriars Glassworks) in London. Powell graduated from Trinity College, Oxford in 1873, where he studied mechanics, physics and chemistry. Powell was hired at Powell's in 1873. He managed the company beginning in 1875 until his retirement in 1919. He was made a partner of the firm in 1893. Powell was chief designer of glassware. His intricate designs of vases, bowls and glassware had a strong following, as the interest and demand for Arts and Crafts Movement style glass and later Art Nouveau glass soared. Whitefriars Glassworks in Tudor Street From the beginning of his career, Powell studied the history of glass and glass making. He scientifically analyzed historic glassware and would to try to recreate the old glass. He also investigated new kinds of glass. Powell discovered that by exposing glass to higher temperatures, he could change the colour in dramatic ways. By 1877, Powell had successfully produced new opalescent glass, a milky opaque straw opal and blue opal, which were very well received in the America. Glass goblet designed by Powell 1895 In the early 1890s, Powell was experimenting with new glass colours, trying to replicate medieval glass. The new colours were developed for the use in the mosaics designed by William Blake Richmond for St. Paul's Cathedral. The new, heavier glass, often with light veins of colour, expanded the company's glass palette and was highly favored by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Powell wrote down his experiments and made detailed notes of his impressions and work in notebooks. The notebooks are now preserved in the British Museum. At the beginning of the 20th century, Powell applied his scientific knowledge to create new products that were used in science, industry and the war effort in the First World War. Powell's innovations include x-ray tubes, light bulbs, and new thermometers. \\"His development of toughened glass for thermometer tubes, optical glass and ultimately for toughened glass for use on naval mines in World War I earned him his CBE, but brought the company through the difficult war years and able to expand vigorously afterwards\\". In 1919, Powell retired from the company. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services during the First World War, which included the products he developed for the war effort. Powell died at his home in Dulwich on 26 November 1922. He was buried in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

History The church was built in the Romanesque style. The oldest part of the church is the eastern part of the nave. The chancel was demolished in circa 1155 to make room for an expansion at both ends. Part of the church was torn down during the Swedish Wars (1658-1659) and used as building materials for military structures by Swedish troops. The church was rebuilt in 1660. In 1675 the church was expanded with a side nave to create symmetry in the architecture. The side nave became known as the Valby Nave (Valbyskibet) since it was reserved for the farmers from Valby when they were no longer allowed to attend Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen and did not want to mix with people from Hvidovre. The first porch, built with timber framing, was replaced by a new one in 1763. The gable and the west wall of the tower are decorated with two sandstone crowns. They were originally located on Copenhagen's Western City Gate. It was demolished in 1857 and the crowns were placed on the church in 1886. It had a steeple with three clocks which was removed in circa 1790. It weather vane is now located on the church tower and features Frederick IV's monogram. The priest's room (pr√¶stev√¶relset) was constructed on the west side of the Valby Nave in 1952. Cemetery Hvidovre Cemetery The church is as other village churches surrounded by a small cemetery. The oldest surviving grave is from around 1750. A private chapel built in red brick stands at the northern cemetery wall. It was built for a Hvidovre farmer and his wife. =Burials= * Th√∏ger Birkeland (1922-2011), author * Bertel Budtz-M√ºller (1890-1946), poet * Karen Margrethe Harup (1924-2009), swimmer * Peter Herman Hoffmark (1907-1987), composer * Victor Johansen (1888-1967), painter * Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan, sculptor (1859-1939), sculptor * Johanne Pedersen-Dan, sculptor (1860-1934), actress and sculptress Cultural references The church was used as a location in the Bodil Award- winning 1955 World War II drama film Der kom en dag.

The Goga cabinet and the King  When the National Liberal Party lost the elections in December 1938, King Carol II appointed Goga Prime Minister of Romania although the National Christian Party had obtained only 9.15% of the votes for the house. Carol II expected the government to be transitional, allowing him to get rid of the party system. He wrote in his diary that he was conscious that the government would not last long and that, after its collapse, he would be able to free his country and himself from the tyranny and the petty interests of the parties. This calculation proved correct. However, the King miscalculated the impact of the Anti-Semitic measures of the Goga cabinet, which he had to deal with throughout his personal regime (the so-called royal dictatorship) that he established on February 10, 1938. The Goga cabinet stripped the Jews of their citizenship, limited their right to work, and simply harassed them through it's anti-Semitic measures, in an effort to gain the support of the electors of the Iron Guard, another anti-Semitic movement and the rival of both the National Christian Party and the King. As a result, the Goga cabinet damaged the Romanian economy and the relations with France, Great Britain, and the League of Nations and strengthened the Iron Guard. It's revision of the Romanian citizenship, as implemented by King Carol II's personal regime, denaturalised 225.222 Jews, i.e. approximately 30% of the population of Jewish faith. King Carol II first pushed towards a victory of the government in the snap elections in March 1938, which he had called on January 18, 1938. However, he soon abandoned Goga, preparing a coup together with the minister of the Interior Armand CƒÉlinescu, a former member of the National Peasants' Party, who acted as a guarantee for the king in the government. The coup was probably precipitated when Goga negotiated an electoral agreement with Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, on February 8, 1938, thus posing a considerable threat to the King's power. On February 9, 1938, Carol II, CƒÉlinescu and the former national liberal prime minister Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu set the coup for the next day. On February 10, 1938, Carol II received Goga and told him to postpone the snap elections, whereupon Goga resigned.

Coles arrived in Massachusetts Bay in 1630 on the Winthrop Fleet where he became a first settler of the towns of Roxbury and Agawam, now Ipswich, and an early settler of Salem. After repeated fines for drunkenness, he was ultimately sentenced to wear a red letter \\"D\\" as a badge of shame for a year, an event that may have served as an inspiration for Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter. He left Massachusetts Bay to join Roger Williams at Providence where he was one of the new colony's 13 original proprietors and a founding member of the First Baptist Church in America. In the Providence Plantations he was a first settler of Pawtuxet and an early settler of Shawomet, now the Rhode Island towns of Cranston and Warwick. His greatest achievement, however, was his co-authorship of the Plantation Agreement at Providence of 1640. Ratified by both men and women in Providence, it established the first secular, representative democracy in America. After Coles's death his family moved to Long Island, New York. Three of his sons founded the city of Glen Cove, New York, while three of his daughters married into the Townsend family who engaged in civil disobedience to promote the separation of church and state. Massachusetts Bay =Arrival and settlements= William F. Halsall Coles arrived in New England in the summer of 1630 as a passenger in the Winthrop Fleet, and was among the first settlers of the town of Roxbury. In October of that year he petitioned the Massachusetts Bay Colony's General Court in Boston to become a freeman and in 1631 he took the freeman's oath. He was a founding member of the First Church of Roxbury, which was a non-separating Congregationalist church established in 1631, and in 1632 he was one of two townsmen elected to represent Roxbury in the General Court. In 1633, Coles was in the first company, led by John Winthrop the Younger, that went to Agawam where he was granted a large home lot on the Ipswich River at present-day East and Cogswell Streets and 200 acres on the neck of land north of town. He moved to Salem in 1635 where he received a home lot in town and 300 acres of farmland south of Felton Hill \\"in the place where his cattle are by Brooksby.\\" =The scarlet letter= Sabbath inspection of taverns In 1631, Coles was fined five marks (about ¬£3 then and US$600 in 2019) for drunkenness aboard the Friendship and at Winnissimet, now Chelsea. The Friendship was carrying two hogsheads (more than 120 gallons) of flavored mead called metheglin. Coles's fellow carousers‚Äîwho were not pious Puritans‚Äîincluded Edward Gibbons, a former polytheist \\"who chose rather to Dance about a May pole...than to hear a good Sermon\\" and Samuel Maverick, a wealthy Anglican \\"very ready to entertain strangers.\\" In 1632, Coles was again fined for drunkenness, this time in Charlestown. In addition to his fine of ¬£1 he was required to appear before the General Court and the Court of Assistants to publicly confess. Coles was charged a third time for drunkenness in 1633, along with fellow settler John Shatswell, at Agawam. Shatswell was fined ¬£2, but Coles was fined ¬£10 (about US$2400 in 2019) for multiple offenses: drunkenness, encouraging Shatswell's wife to drink, and \\"intiseing her to incontinency and other misdemeanor.\\" Coles was also sentenced \\"to stand with a whte sheete of pap on his back wherein a drunkard shalbe written in great letters, & stand therewith soe longe as the Court thinks meete....\\" He was charged a fourth time in 1634, this time in Roxbury, and the court responded with more severe penalties: he was forced to wear a red letter \\"D\\" (for drunkenness) for a year and was disenfranchised (deprived of voting rights). > The court orders that Coles, for drunkenness by him committed at Roxbury > shall be disfranchized, weare about his necke & soe to hange upon his > outward garment a D made of redd clothe & sett upon white, to contynue this > for a yeare & not to leave it off at any tyme when hee comes amongst > company.... Coles was re-enfranchised just two months later and was never again charged with drunkenness. However, his wife, Mary, was accused of intemperance in the Roxbury church records, where it was noted that \\"after her husband's excommunication and falls, she did too much favor his ways....\\" Coles's red- letter punishment is mentioned in Anya Seton's 1958 bestselling historical novel, The Winthrop Woman, about the governor's daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Fones. Some scholars argue that Coles's punishment was among those Nathaniel Hawthorne had in mind when he wrote the 1850 novel, The Scarlet Letter, which chronicles the struggles of a fictional woman sentenced to wear a red letter for adultery. Melissa McFarland Pennell, a University of Massachusetts English professor, recounts Coles's punishment in her book The historian's Scarlet letter: reading Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece as social and cultural history (2018). In Henry Augustin Beers's Initial Studies in American Letters (1895), the late Yale University literary historian wrote: > The reader of Winthrop's Journal comes everywhere upon hints which the > imagination has since shaped into poetry and romance. The germs of many of > Longfellow's \\"New England Tragedies,\\" of Hawthorne's \\"Maypole of > Merrymount,\\" and Endicott's \\"Red Cross,\\" and of Whittier's \\"John Underbill\\" > and \\"The Familists' Hymn\\" are all to be found in some dry, brief entry of > the old Puritan diarist. \\"Robert Cole, having been oft punished for > drunkenness, was now ordered to wear a red D about his neck for a year,\\" to > wit, the year 1633, and thereby gave occasion to the greatest American > romance, \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" Providence Plantations =Arrival and settlements= Roger Williams‚Äîa Salem preacher who advocated for church-state separation and Native American land rights‚Äîwas banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 and in the following year he acquired land from Canonicus and Miantonomi, the chief sachems of the Narragansett people, to create Providence Plantation. By 1637 Robert Coles moved from Salem to Providence and in 1638 he became one of Providence's first 13 proprietors and a founding member of the first Baptist church congregation in America. At the inaugural church meeting, at least twelve settlers gathered together with Roger Williams who, after being baptized by Ezekiel Holliman, baptized Coles and the others. Each of the original proprietors received a narrow, five- or six-acre, river-front home lot that stretched eastward from Towne Street, now Main Street, to \\"a highway,\\" now Hope Street in present-day College Hill, Providence, and they received shares of upland and meadow on the south side of town. Robert Coles's home lot was on the Great Salt Cove between the lots of Thomas Olney and William Carpenter and along the ancient \\"highway\\" called the Wampanoag trail, now Meeting Street. The land granted to him south of town laid east of Mashapaug Pond. In 1638, Roger Williams purchased land from the Pawtuxet sachem Socononoco that stretched from the meadows on the Pawtuxet River southward to Conimicut Point. Coles's share included an inland meadow and land at Passeonkquis Cove and Namquid, now called Gaspee Point, and he was granted permission by the Pawtuxet tribe to graze cattle on their farmland in the winter. Soon after the 1638 purchase, Coles built a home on the Pawtuxet River near the falls in present-day Pawtuxet Village. By 1648‚Äîthe year Shawomet was renamed to honor the Earl of Warwick‚Äîhe was listed as a townsmen of Warwick, where he erected his mill and resided for the remainder of his life. =Plantation Agreement of 1640= Coles, Chad Brown, William Harris, and John Warner co-authored the Plantation Agreement at Providence of 1640, which was titled the \\"Report of Arbitrators at Providence, containing proposals for a form of Government\\" and referred to as the Combination. It was ratified by 39 male and female townsmen‚Äîan early milestone in women's rights. The Combination is listed among the colonial documents that influenced American constitutionalism. The Combination replaced the direct democracy of the original compact of 1637 with a representative, democratic government designed to solve disputes, especially land disputes. It contained 12 articles that defined the borders of Providence, created an elected board of arbitrators and an appeals process, created town offices, and affirmed the separation of church and state as the determination \\"to hold forth liberty of conscience.\\" The Combination resolved the problem of assembling a quorum of busy townsmen to make decisions, but it left open how those decisions would be enforced. =Gorton controversy= Arrest of Gortonites In 1641, Coles and John Greene gave Samuel Gorton‚Äîa religious leader and agitator fleeing Portsmouth‚Äîsome of their land in Pawtuxet. The parcel Coles gave to Gorton was at Papaquinapaug, the region near present-day Fenner Pond south of Roger Williams Park. To Coles's dismay, Gorton and his followers, the Gortonites, rejected the authority of the Plantation Agreement of 1640 and became embroiled in bitter disputes. The trouble began when the Providence arbitrators voted to settle a dispute by seizing some cattle owned by a Gortonite named Francis Weston. The Gortonites fought off the townsmen sent to take the cattle. Seeking a way to expel the Gortonites from Pawtuxet, Coles and three other original Pawtuxet settlers‚ÄîWilliam Arnold, William Carpenter, and Benedict Arnold‚Äîtraveled to Boston in 1642 to petition the General Court to place their land under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts Bay Colony. The General Court made Coles and the other three petitioners justices of the peace. The Gortonites moved south to Shawomet, out of the jurisdiction of the justices and Massachusetts Bay, where they purchased 90 square miles from the sachem Miantonomi. Benedict Arnold convinced Socononoco and Pomham, the sachems of Pawtuxet and Shawomet, to complain to Massachusetts Bay that they did not agree to the sale. Gorton and some Gortonites were arrested in 1643 by Massachusetts Bay soldiers after a violent struggle and were taken to Boston to stand trial. Personal life Coles was said to suffer from an unusual \\"vnsetlednesse & removing fr≈ç place to place\\" which, according to the Puritan minister of his former church in Roxbury, contributed to his first wife's death. Notwithstanding, and indeed because of, his unsettledness he acquired hundreds of acres of land in Massachusetts Bay and the Providence Plantations. In 1650, of the 50 tax- payers in Providence, Benedict Arnold paid the highest property tax while five townsmen‚ÄîColes, William Arnold, Richard Scott, William Field, and William Carpenter‚Äîpaid the second highest tax. Sachem NinigretHis religious life, too, was unsettled. He was excommunicated by his Puritan church in Massachusetts Bay, which may have contributed to his moving to Providence. In Providence, he was a founding member of the Baptist church, but it was later said that, in lieu of Christian worship, he \\"usually conversed with and was conversant amongst the Indians on the Sabbath days\\" to learn about Native American religion. In the winter of 1637, three members of the Pequot tribe escaped captivity in Boston and were taken in by Providence residents. One was a woman who joined Coles's household, probably as a servant. Roger Williams recounted her treatment in Boston: \\"...of the natives in Boston [she] is used worst: is beaten with firesticks...because a fellow lay with her, but she saith, for her part she refused.‚Äù Roger Williams instructed the Providence residents to welcome them and \\"to walke wisely and justly towards them, so to make mercy eminent....\\" Coles occasionally fell out with his indigenous neighbors. In 1649, Nanheggen of Pawtuxet and Wesuontup of Mashapaug were accused of breaking into the Providence homes of Coles and Jane Sears. Nanheggen, who was one of Coles's workers, was convicted by a jury while Wesuontup was acquitted. In 1652, Coles sold a mastiff dog to Ninigret, the sachem of the Niantic people. The dog ran away from Ninigret and returned to Coles who killed it, possibly to protect poultry or livestock. Coles was fined after Ninigret pressed charges. Family Robert Coles, whose ancestry remains unknown, was born probably in England. He and his first wife, Mary, appeared together for the first time in the records of the Roxbury church. Because Mary's death was recorded in an undated note in Roxbury church records, it is thought she died before he moved to Providence. His second wife, Mary Hawxhurst (‚Äì1656), was the daughter of Sampson Hawxhurst (1571‚Äì1627), vicar of Nuneaton in Warwickshire, England, and Elizabeth. After Robert Coles's death, Mary Hawxhurst married Matthias Harvey and moved to Oyster Bay on Long Island. Coles had at least seven children, four of whom were under 18 years of age when he died. His children by his first wife, Mary, were John Coles (m. Ann), Deliverance Coles (m. Richard Townsend), and Ann Coles (m. Henry Townsend). His children by his second wife, Mary Hawxhurst, were Daniel Coles (m. Mahershalalhasbaz Gorton, daughter of Samuel Gorton), Nathaniel Coles (m. Martha Jackson, Deborah Wright, Sarah Harcurt), Sarah Coles (m. Captain Thomas Townsend), and Captain Robert Coles Jr. (m. Mercy Wright). U.S. postage stamp commemorating the Flushing Remonstrance. Coles died intestate in 1655 in Warwick, Providence Plantations. The Warwick town council settled his debts and distributed net assets of about ¬£400 (about US$102,000 in 2019) to his heirs. The settlement included the sale of the \\"Mill of Warwick\\" and land in Pawtuxet to establish a trust worth ¬£170 (about US$44,000 in 2019) for his minor children. Three of Coles's daughters married into the Townsend family. The Townsends came to Warwick after conflicts over religious liberty with authorities in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Ann Coles's husband, Henry Townsend, was fined and imprisoned more than once in New Netherland for hosting Quaker meetings and for political agitation. He signed the Flushing Remonstrance in 1657 to protest the persecution of Quakers and others in New Netherland. A year later Ann Coles was charged with support of the \\"odious sect.\\" The Townsends later settled in Oyster Bay, which was out of Dutch jurisdiction. Three of Coles's sons‚ÄîRobert Jr., Nathaniel, and Daniel Coles‚Äîwere original proprietors of Musketa Cove Plantation, now the city of Glen Cove, New York, near Oyster Bay. The home that Robert Coles Jr. built there in 1668 still stands. Notable descendants The notable descendants of Robert Coles include industrialist Walter Chrysler (1875‚Äì1940) who founded the Chrysler Corporation, novelist Miriam Coles Harris (1834‚Äì1925), American Revolutionary War spies Robert Townsend (1753‚Äì1838) and Sarah \\"Sally\\" Townsend (1760‚Äì1842) who were siblings and members of the secret Culper Ring, spy Jesse Coles (1757‚Äì1839) who was captured while carrying a message to General Washington, and Robert R. Coles (1907‚Äì1985) who was chairman of the Hayden Planetarium.

Born in London, England, Abrahams arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, as an eight-year- old with his family in 1860. Later that decade, Abrahams attended the Artisans School of Design in Carlton, where he met Frederick McCubbin. The pair formed a close friendship and later enrolled at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1871, where they founded a club to study the nude. McCubbin named his first son Louis after Abrahams, who reciprocated by naming his son Frederick. Both artists, along with fellow National Gallery student Tom Roberts, established the Box Hill artists' camp in 1885. Later accompanied by Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder and others, the group sought to capture the Australian bush by painting it en plein air. By the time the group relocated to Mount Eagle estate (Eaglemont) near Heidelberg in 1888, Abrahams had less time for art due to the demands of the family cigar business. He still made trips to visit his friends at Eaglemont, and supplied them with many cigar-box lids for painting impressions. 183 of these cigar-box paintings were exhibited by Roberts, Streeton and Conder in the landmark 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition of 1889. Abrahams sat for some of McCubbin's best-known paintings, including Down on His Luck (1889) and A Bush Burial (1890), and he is the subject of portraits by McCubbin, Roberts, Streeton, Julian Ashton, John Mather and others. Due to his financial support of the Australian impressionists, Abrahams, along with his brother and business partner Lawrence, is regarded as an important patron of early Australian art. Abrahams suffered from depression and committed suicide in his St Kilda home on 2 December 1903.\\"The Suicide of a City Man\\" (4 December 1903), The Argus. Retrieved 31 July 2018.

There was minimal fighting. The Japan already had a military alliance with Britain, but that did not obligate it to enter the war. It joined the Allies in order to make territorial gains. It acquired Germany's scattered small holdings in the Pacific and on the China coast. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. Japan's occupation of Siberia against the Bolsheviks proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference, at the end of the war, Japan was largely frustrated in its ambitions. Background Japan transformed dramatically in the latter 19th century from an almost totally closed in society to a modern industrialized, Empire-building and militarily aggressive new nation. It seized colonies such as Okinawa, it defeated China in a major war in 1890s, and to the astonishment of the world it defeated Russia in a full-scale war in 1904-05. It made aggressive demands, took full control of Korea, was expanding into Manchuria, and was demanding special privileges in the Chinese economy.James William Morley, ed., Japan's Foreign Policy: 1868-1941 (1974).W.H. Beasley, Japanese Imperialism 1894‚Äì1945 1909 cartoon in the English magazine Puck shows (clockwise from rightmost figure) US, Germany, Britain, France and Japan engaged in naval race in a \\"no limit\\" game. Japan and Great Britain had both avoided military alliances before 1900. That changed in 1902 with the signing of a treaty. It was a diplomatic milestone that saw an end to Britain's splendid isolation, and removed the need for Britain to build up its navy in the Pacific. The alliance was renewed and expanded in scope twice, in 1905 and 1911. The original goal was opposition to Russian expansion. The alliance facilitated Japanese entry into the World War, but did not require Japan to do so.Phillips Payson O'Brien, The Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1902-1922. (2004). Britain had not consulted Japan before declaring war on Germany, but soon after the war began it requested Japanese help in identifying the location of German shipping, which it admitted was a non-neutral act. Japan decided that for its own prestige in world affairs it had to join the war effort. The European allies formally gave Japan the status of a full ally, and Britain, France, Russia and Italy guaranteed support at the peace conference for Japan's claims to take over Germany's possessions in China. However, Britain was increasingly annoyed at Japanese aggression, and quietly warned that it should not occupy German islands in the South Pacific (which were desired by Australia and New Zealand), should not become involved in the Eastern Pacific, and should not seize the Dutch East Indies.Laurence Frederic Fitzhardinge, \\"Australia, Japan and Great Britain, 1914‚Äì18: A study in triangular diplomacy.\\" Australian Historical Studies 14.54 (1970): 250-259. When Japan ignored the hints, Britain made them public, and Tokyo felt insulted. Japan entered the war without restrictions, but in practice it took German possessions in China, German islands north of the equator, and made serious threats to Chinese autonomy, the Twenty-One Demands. China, feeling the very heavy pressure from Tokyo, and gaining widespread support from all the other Allies, decided it had to enter the war as well.Asada Masafumi, \\"The China-Russia-Japan Military Balance in Manchuria, 1906‚Äì1918.\\" Modern Asian Studies 44.6 (2010): 1283-1311. The British were not at all pleased with Tokyo, and fielded even stronger complaints from Washington and from Australia. The Paris Peace Conference did endorse Japan's gaining League mandates over the former German possessions. But Japan went much further and demanded that a clause be inserted in the Covenant of the proposed League of Nations, announcing the organization's commitment to racial equality. Britain, and the dominions voted no, as did the United States; it never passed and the insult rankled for years. Finally the Japanese intervention in Siberia, while parallel to the interventions by Britain, France and the United States, seemed like too much of a land grab. By 1907, Japan had come to d√©tente with Russia, but the 1917 collapse of the Russian Imperial government meant that Siberia was wide open. Japan wanted to renew the basic treaty with Britain, but increasingly vocal opposition came from the dominions, the United States, China, and inside Britain itself. The diplomatic solution was to end negotiations on renewal, and have all the major players endorse the naval limitations agreement of the Washington Conference of 1921. To Japanese disappointment, the treaty with Britain expired in 1923. Tokyo now had no allies or real friends.Ian H. Nish, \\" Japan's policies toward Britain,\\" in James William Morley, ed., Japan's Foreign Policy: 1868-1941 (1974) pp 184-235.Akira Iriye. After Imperialism: The Search for a New Order in the Far East, 1921‚Äì1931 (1965)., Operations against Germany The onset of the First World War in Europe eventually showed how far German‚ÄìJapanese relations had truly deteriorated. On 7 August 1914, only three days after Britain declared war on the German Empire, the Japanese government received an official request from the British government for assistance in destroying the German raiders of the Kaiserliche Marine in and around Chinese waters. Japan, eager to reduce the presence of European colonial powers in South-East Asia, especially on China's coast, sent Germany an ultimatum on 14 August 1914, which was left unanswered. Japan then formally declared war on Germany on 23 August 1914 thereby entering the First World War as an ally of Britain, France and Russia. It promptly seized the German-held Caroline, Marshall, and Mariana Islands in the Pacific. A Japanese lithograph depicting Japan's troops attacking the German colony of Tsingtao in 1914 The only major battle that took place between Japan and Germany was the siege of the German-controlled Chinese port of Tsingtao in Kiautschou Bay. The German forces held out from August until November 1914, under a total Japanese/British blockade, sustained artillery barrages and manpower odds of 6:1 ‚Äì a fact that gave a morale boost during the siege as well as later in defeat. After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they were treated with respect at places like the Band≈ç Prisoner of War camp.Schultz-Naumann, p. 207. The Naruto camp orchestra (enlarged from the band of the III. Seebatallion) gave Beethoven and Bach concerts throughout Japan wearing their uniforms In 1919, when the German Empire formally signed the Treaty of Versailles, all prisoners of war were set free and returned to Europe. Japan was a signatory of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated harsh repercussions for Germany. In the Pacific, Japan gained Germany's islands north of the equator (the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands) and Kiautschou/Tsingtao in China.Louis (1967), pp. 117‚Äì130 Article 156 of the Treaty also transferred German concessions in Shandong to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to the Republic of China, an issue soon to be known as Shandong Problem. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations, and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement influenced China not to sign the treaty. China declared the end of its war against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty with Germany in 1921. This fact greatly contributed to Germany relying on China, and not Japan, as its strategic partner in East Asia for the coming years.Sun Yat-sen. The International Development of China page 298. China Cultural Service, Taipei, 1953 Operations against China In 1914 Japanese and British military forces liquidated Germany's holdings in China. Japan occupied the German military colony in Qingdao, and occupied portions of Shandong Province. China was financially chaotic, highly unstable politically, and militarily very weak. China declared war on Germany in August 1917 as a technicality to make it eligible to attend the postwar peace conference, where they hoped to find friends who would help block the threats of Japanese expansion. They planned to send a combat unit to the Western Front, but never did so.Stephen G. Craft, \\"Angling for an Invitation to Paris: China's Entry into the First World War\\".

British diplomats were afraid that the U.S. and Japan would displace Britain's leadership role in the Chinese economy. They sought to play Japan and the United States against each other, while at the same time maintaining cooperation among all three nations against Germany.Clarence B.

Pacific Historical Review 48#1 (1979): 47‚Äì63. in JSTOR In January 1915, Japan secretly issued an ultimatum of Twenty-One Demands to the Chinese government. They included Japanese control of former German rights, 99 year leases in southern Manchuria, an interest in steel mills, and concessions regarding railways. China did have a seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. However it was refused a return of the former German concessions and China had to accept the Twenty-One demands. A major reaction to this humiliation was a surge in Chinese nationalism expressed in the May Fourth Movement.Zhitian Luo, \\"National humiliation and national assertion-The Chinese response to the twenty-one demands\\" Modern Asian Studies (1993) 27#2 pp 297‚Äì319.

Before he died the previous emperor had appointed group of eight regents, led by Sushun, who were adjutant generals and grand councillors, to assist his infant son Zaichun, later to be known as the Tongzhi Emperor. The eight regents, Zaiyuan, Duanhua, Jingshou, Sushun, Muyin, Kuangyuan, Du Han and Jiao Youying were later forced to commit suicide. Other sources says only three officials were forced to commit suicide. Background Portrait of Empress Dowager Ci'an (co-regent with Cixi), with whom Cixi staged the Xinyou Coup. While most of the royal family fled the western occupation of Peking, Prince Gong remained in the city to deal with the crisis. He would gain respect from the opposition westerners as a result of his conduct. By the time of the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a shrewd political strategist. In Rehe Province, while waiting for an astrologically favourable time to transport the emperor's coffin back to Beijing, Cixi conspired with court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. Cixi's position as the lower-ranked empress dowager had no intrinsic political power attached to it. In addition, her son, the young emperor, was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures, including the late emperor's principal wife, Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning empress dowagers, with powers exceeding the eight regents; the two had long been close friends since Cixi first came to the imperial household.Edward Behr, The Last Emperor, 1987, p. 45 Tensions grew between the two Empresses Dowager and the eight regents, who were led by Sushun. The regents did not appreciate Cixi's interference in political affairs, and their frequent confrontations with the Empresses Dowager left Empress Dowager Ci'an frustrated. Ci'an often refused to come to court audiences, leaving Cixi to deal with the ministers alone. Secretly, Cixi had begun gathering the support of talented ministers, soldiers, and others who were ostracized by the eight regents for personal or political reasons. Among them was Prince Gong, who had been excluded from power, yet harboured great ambitions, and Prince Chun, the sixth and seventh brothers of the Xianfeng Emperor, respectively. While Cixi aligned herself with the two princes, a memorial came from Shandong asking for her to \\"listen to politics behind the curtains,\\" i.e., to assume power as de facto ruler. The same memorial also asked Prince Gong to enter the political arena as a principal \\"aide to the Emperor\\". When the Xianfeng Emperor's funeral procession left for Beijing, Cixi took advantage of her alliances with Princes Gong and Chun. She and the boy emperor returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the eight regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased emperor's procession. Cixi's early return to Beijing meant that she had more time to plan with Prince Gong and ensure that the power base of the eight regents was divided between Sushun and his allies, Zaiyuan and Duanhua. In order to remove them from power, history was rewritten: the regents were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the \\"barbarians\\" that had caused the Xianfeng Emperor to flee to Rehe Province \\"greatly against his will\\", among other charges. To display her high moral standards, Cixi executed only three of the eight regents. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as slow slicing (\\"death by a thousand cuts\\"), but Cixi declined the suggestion and ordered that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two also marked for execution, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, were given pieces of white silk for them to hang themselves with. In addition, Cixi refused outright the idea of executing the family members of the regents, as would be done in accordance with imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing imperial tradition also dictated that women and princes were never to engage in politics. In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the only empress dowager in the Qing dynasty to rule from \\"behind the curtains\\", a practice known as chu√≠ li√°n tƒ´ng zh√®ng () in Chinese.

In its genus, it is sister to R. gigas. Description The female of R. nasutus ranges anywhere from about in length, and the male is generally between about . Distribution R. nasutus is found in waters across the globe, primarily in the open ocean and continental shelf and slope waters. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= R. nasutus is seasonal in terms of the timing of reproduction. Off of the waters of southern California, it generally reproduces from February to April, and it also can reproduce in late summer, as late as June. This reproduction is likely to be limited by food, as evidenced by this copepod failing to breed in the absence of food. Copepodite stages I through IV are usually found in the surface waters (from sea level to in depth). The abundance of individuals in the surface, however, varies seasonally: they are most abundant during the spring, and are not present during summer and autumn. Stage V copepodites and adults are generally distributed below in depth, and especially below . In seasonal waters, such as the Gulf of Aqaba, stage V copepodites go into diapause to moult into females. During this time, they also rapidly accumulate wax esters, possibly for future reproduction.

His works remain primarily in print in the Gaelic tongue. Life and Work While he was a member of the Macartan lineage from County Down, and descended from Eachmilidh Macartan, he is said to have been born in the town on Doon in County Cork, the son of Phelim Mac Curtain. However, which 'Doon' this is in Munster a matter of speculation, as it is a common prefix to Irish placenames. Mac Curtain appears to descend from the famous Lords of Kinelarty, and appears to have been of some means among the Gaelic gentry. During the Williamite Wars he served in a Spanish cavalry regiment of King James II and the local MacCarthy or MacCartney lords in Desmond. He fought at the battle of B√©al √Åtha Salainn (Six Mile Water, County Antrim 29 April 1691) a few miles from his native home, where he led the men of his district in an ambush on a group of Williamite soldiers. When peace was finally concluded in the 1690s he settled in the town of Dromboy, near Carrignavar in Co. Cork. There he assumed the position of schoolmaster, where he translated texts from Latin and Gaelic, and wrote poetry. Most of his works are dedicated to the Gaelic gentry which had recently become dispossessed of their land by the English crown. When Dermot Mac Carthaig died in 1705, Mac Curtain took his place as head of the bardic school, a post he held until his own death in 1724. Subsequent to his death, the school relocated to Blarney, further south in Co. Cork. The bulk of Mac Curtain's work remains untranslated, but it is noted that he dedicated his prose to other members of the Gaelic intelligentsia who survived the Williamite persecutions. One work he dedicated to his close friend, John Baptist MacSleyne, titular Bishop of Cork. He went on to collect local legends which would be woven into James Macpherson's magnum opus, translated and compiling the famous works of Ois√≠n in the early 18th century. He died at Longstone, near Whitechurch, Co. Cork, where he was buried. William was brother to Conchobhar Mac Curtain, and the nephew of Fr. Cornelius Curtain. He was survived by his children, Lesa N√≠ Mhunghaile relates that he had two other sons, and at least one daughter. He was succeeded at the bardic school by Liam Ruadh Mac Coitir. His grandson John MacCurtain (Sean an Duna) appears to have continued that family ties to the bardic school, serving as a patron in the late 18th century.

It is located within Olympic National Park. At high, Mount Johnson is the fourth highest peak of the Olympic Mountains, after Mount Olympus, Mount Deception, and Mount Constance. It is the highest peak in The Needles range which is a subset of the Olympic range. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Deception, to the south.  History  Mount Johnson was given its name based on what was believed to be the first ascent by Elvin Johnson and George Martin in 1940. However, new evidence has become available establishing that it was climbed by Scott Osborn, Joe Halwax, and John King circa 1935. Climate Mount Johnson is set in the eastern portion of the Olympic Mountains within the drainage basin of the Dungeness River. This location puts it in the rain shadow of the Olympic Range, resulting in less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. Martin Peak Mount Johnson is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Recreation While not a particularly technical climb, Mount Johnson is a steep and exposed class 4 scramble. It's one of several mountaineering objectives in the Royal Basin area.

They were built from 1930 to 1950 by private citizens using their own initiative, resources and labour. It refers to the specific communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms, also known collectively as the Royal National Park Coastal Shack Communities. The area is owned by the Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 April 2012.  History  In the 1870s Sydney was expanding at a rapid pace, helped partly by the extension of the railway network, but railroads needed a helping hand to make them viable and keep them expanding. Premier of New South Wales John Robertson believed this could be achieved by encouraging people to take train rides to the countryside. At the time, appreciation of the wilderness was a growing trend in Sydney and around the world, and the world's first national park was proclaimed in the United States at Yellowstone in 1872. Robertson was also concerned about both logging and the growth of the city continuing unchecked without green spaces. In 1879 he proclaimed an area south of Sydney as a national park. In 1954 Queen Elizabeth II travelled through the park by train and in 1955 it became the Royal National Park. The cabin communities of Little Garie, Era, and Burning Palms and were generally built between the late-1930s and early-1950s on freehold land with the permission of the landholder or the person holding grazing rights. The land at Portions 1, 7, 13, 44, 47 and 48 Parish Bulgo, County of Westmoreland are collectively known as the \\"Era Lands\\". Portion 1, the largest portion, was a grant in 1832 to Andrew Byrne. On Byrne's death, , the land was managed by a Trust along with other property of Byrne for the benefit of the Trustees. The other portions were in various ownership; Portions 13 and 44, where Little Garie is sited, were owned by the Adams and Collaery families respectively. Byrne, who held land in Sydney and Appin, ran cattle on these lands and this was continued by his descendants who used the Burgh track to move cattle to and from the area. This track was later used by Helensburgh miners and people fishing to get to the coast in what later became the cabin areas. The Aboriginal sites recorded within and around the cabin groupings provide evidence of the long Aboriginal use and occupation of this area.DEC 2005 This association was continued during the pastoral use period and oral history indicates that the first hut was built at Era by the Aboriginal stockman \\"Old Tom\\" and that it was present in about 1910-1912.NPWS 1994 Tom was employed to look after the cattle on the land that supplied meat to southern Sydney and the Illawarra. This cabin was later taken over by the Lightfoot family of Helensburgh, and today is believed to be cabin No. 88. In the 1910s and 1920s people from the nearby mining town of Helensburgh often visited the coast and camped in the area, usually to fish. During the Depression, the number of campers and occupants increased with extended periods of occupation. Little Garie was known as Tin Hut at this time. The Collaery family allowed the building of cabins on the area they owned or had grazing rights over. In the late 1930s Robert Gray, who had a World War I soldier settler grant on top of the escarpment, obtained a grazing lease from the Trustees of the Byrne Estate. Gray allowed the building of shacks, allocated sites for them and collected rent, initially a shilling a week, rising to 2 shillings per week by the 1940s. During the mid-to-later 1930s more bushwalkers from Sydney discovered the area as a recreation resource, some arriving from the adjoining National Park with others making their way down the ridge to what were termed \\"hide away\\" villages in the press of the time. During World War II and immediately after, the numbers of huts grew as people from Sydney joined those from Helensburgh. This reflects a pattern of social and workplace reforms in NSW at that time including the introduction of annual leave in 1944. In 1944 there were approximately 38 cabins at Era, 13 at Little Garie and 15 at Burning Palms. At this time a number of Sydney artists \\"found\\" Era and people such as Margaret Olley, Max Dupain, David Moore, Hal Missingham and many others visited and stayed at the community. In the mid-1940s rumours circulated that the Byrne estate was to sell the land. People at Era and Burning Palms formed a Protection League with its first meeting taking place on 14 October 1945 at Era in order to try to purchase the land, or otherwise seek the protection of the cabin communities. A notice of sale for the Portion 1 Byrne Estate land was placed in the Sun Herald newspaper in February 1950. After considerable organisation and lobbying by bushwalker organisations and the Protection League the land was resumed by the State Government in February 1950 for the purpose of public recreation. At that time some nature conservation groups questioned inclusion of the area into the National Park because of the recreation development focus of the National Park Trust, preferring inclusion into Garawarra State Park. Indeed, some evidence suggests that a close relationship existed between Deputy Premier Joseph Cahill, who was also the Chairman of the National Park Trust, and the Little Garie community that may have played a part in the decision to resume. Nevertheless, in September 1953 the area was incorporated into the National Park administered by the National Park Trust. In 1953 there were 37 cabins at Little Garie, 116 at Era and 43 at Burning Palms. At the time of resumption the Lands Minister advised the Secretary of the Protection League that cabin owners could \\"remain in possession\\" of their huts and tents. The National Park became the Royal National Park in 1954 in honour of the Queen's visit to Australia. The Royal National Park, first established in 1879, is an iconic national park being the oldest in Australia and the second oldest in the world. The State Park Trust prepared a full inventory of the cabins in 1953 (including size, construction and ownership details) with Lands Inspector Mr Kentwell recommending that the cabins and their occupation was an appropriate use of the land and that the revenue would provide important revenue for the Trust. At this time the Trust relied to some extent on the income of permissive occupancies. At Bonnie Vale on Port Hacking, adjacent to Bundeena, it had planned and managed the construction of what became a cabin village.NPWS 1994:39 For the next 16 years rental on the cabins was collected by the National Park Trust and cabins were bought and sold, with the Park Trust being notified of these transfers. Some current members of the cabin communities purchased their cabins during this time. Embryonic community moves to set up surf clubs at Era and Burning Palms received added impetus following a drowning at Era in 1938. Asher Joel (later Sir Asher Joel), then publicist for the National Park Trust, was charged by the Trust to assist with setting up Surf Clubs at Garie Beach, Era and Burning Palms. He became the first President of the Garie Surf Life Saving Club. Those three clubs operate to this day and it is their proud boast that they have not had a single drowning on a patrol day. There was no formal documentation of licences until in 1965 the Park Trust was forced by the then Minister of Lands (and later Premier) Tom Lewis, to issue a Permissive Occupancy that regularised the occupations. This Permissive Occupancy (PO) document prevented the transfer of cabins in the future. Cabin owners opposed it, but by 1966 were forced to sign the PO agreement after threats that if it was not signed \\"action would be taken\\". With the passing of the National Parks and Wildlife Act (NSW), 1967 the Park Trust was dissolved and the National Parks and Wildlife Service established to manage national parks in NSW. The philosophical environment in this period favoured the reinforcement of natural values by removing where necessary cultural places and uses, in particular places of habitation. Within RNP, occupancies tolerated by the National Park Trust were removed. In the immediate area fishermen's shacks at Werrong, Jibbon and Marley were all removed, and the historic Allambie Guest House was burnt down. Other guest houses on the Hacking River were demolished, whilst other buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were removed. The 1966 Permissive Occupancy agreement was replaced in 1979 by a licence that was terminable at the will of the Minister and non-transferable. The National Parks and Wildlife Service adopted the policy of removing the cabins on the death of the owner, or if rent fell into arrears. Over the next thirty years over 55 cabins at Era, Burning Palms and Little Garie and the whole community of Bonnie Vale (with the exception of approximately 8-10 cabins) were removed. In order to circumvent the cabin demolition policy, there were unofficial transfers of cabins. In some instances, when people died the family did not notify the NPWS of the death and the family continued to pay the rent. Other transfers of cabins occurred with elderly people who could no longer maintain them adopting another community member, particularly a Surf Club member, to assist with and take over the cabin. In the 1980s the communities sought and achieved heritage listing with the National Trust of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission and nominated the groups for protection under the 1977 Heritage Act (NSW). As a result of these listings and nomination the NPWS prepared a state- wide huts study, part of which was a draft Cabins Conservation Plan that was placed on public exhibition in September 1994 along with a revised Plan of Management for the Royal National Park. The draft CMP recommended the retention of all the cabin communities and the Plan of Management recognised that the cabin communities were of cultural significance and should be retained. Along with the public exhibition of the draft Cabins Conservation Plan a moratorium was placed on cabin demolition. The Plan of Management was adopted in February 2000 and a subsequent RNP Coastal Cabins Areas Conservation Management Plan (CMP) was prepared in 2005.DECC 2005 In December 2006, following proceedings in the Land and Environment Court instigated by the RNP Coastal Cabins Protection League, an agreement was reached between the majority of cabin owners in the Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms communities and the Minister for the Environment that provides for a licence to these cabin owners for up to 20 years and does not exclude the issuing of further licences (but the Minister is not bound in any way to do so). The Bulgo community, at the far southern end of RNP with approximately 57 cabins, was not party to that court action and agreement and has chosen not to be part of this SHR nomination. There are two other cabin groups within RNP: one coastal cabin group at Bulgo below Otford at the southern end of the Park and one at Bonnie Vale adjacent to Bundeena on Port Hacking at the northern end of the Park. The Bulgo group of approximately 53 cabins are similar in their form and in the nature of construction and use, however they are more strongly associated with the mining community of Helensburgh. The Bonnie Vale cabins are different to the coastal groups; they were constructed under the auspices of the National Park Trust and the site was accessible by car which has changed, to some extent, the nature of the built form. Along with the Bulgo and Bonnie Vale cabins the cabin communities at Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms are by far the largest remaining groups of recreational cabins within the OEH estate and NSW generally. The historical associations with RNP and the aesthetic qualities of their dramatic landscape settings also set these RNP cabins apart from similar structures elsewhere. While there are a large number of huts within Kosciuszko National Park and elsewhere within OEH estate, the RNP cabins are quite different in their history, construction and nature of use to the other huts; the huts are also diversely located whereas the RNP cabins are closely grouped with different resulting cultural landscape and social values. Other small cabin groups exist within OEH estate such as: Crater Cove, Dobroyd Head; Sydney Harbour National Park (7 huts), Mullet Creek, Brisbane Water National Park (11 cabins and cottages spread along the Creek); and Sandon, Yuraygir National Park, north of Grafton (13 cabins in 3 groups). There are two groups of cabins licensed to professional fishers in Myall Lakes National Park; 9 cabins for prawn fishers at Tamboy on the Myall River; and the 7 fishers cabins on Broughton Island. All of these groups are smaller and have different historical and physical characteristics to the RNP coastal cabins. Outside OEH estate in NSW, small weekender cabin groups exist at Boat Harbour, Kurnell; Patonga, Pittwater; several small groups on Lake Macquarie on land managed by the Department of Lands; and the former Currawong Workers' Holiday Camp at Pittwater. Similarly to OEH estate, these groups represent significantly different histories and physical characteristics to the RNP coastal cabins; for example the Currawong cottages were constructed in a planned manner by a single entity at one time. Weekender cabin groups exist in other states: in Tasmania around the central highlands lakes; on the Murray River in Victoria; and in South Australia and Western Australia. However, in these states there has been a progressive removal of cabins in the last three decades, particularly on public lands. An important contextual issue is the associations between the cabin communities and the history and significance of Royal National Park, now included on the National Heritage List. RNP provides important evidence of key developments in the nature of recreation in Australia and also provides a visually and ecologically significant setting for the cabin groups. Royal National Park was named NSW's most popular national park for domestic visitors in 2012 when a state government commissioned survey found it received 4 million visits during that year. The surge of popularity followed restoration of the Audley Dance Hall, providing a new visitor centre, cafe and function centre. The latest survey showed visits dropped to 3.2 million in 2014, relegating it to second most popular (to Blue Mountains National Park). In September 2015 Royal National Park grew by 8.5ha through inclusion of a parcel of land at Bundeena previously owned by Sutherland Shire Council. The transfer of ownership is the first part of a \\"land swap\\" the Council has been seeking from the state government. In return, Council is expected to be given ownership of Loftus Oval, Heathcote Oval and Grays Point Oval, which at present are part of the National Park. Council has requested that extra land be excised from the National Park next to Loftus Oval so an extra playing field, with a synthetic surface, can be provided. It is believed the transfer of the Bundeena site, which includes a former night soil depot, was gazetted in August. Environment Minister Mark Speakman and Mayor Kent Johns were set to make an announcement on site yesterday but it was cancelled on Friday. Mr Speakman said the council-owned land was added to the National Park at no cost to the government. He said it contained upland swamp, a coastal relic cliff dune system and endangered vegetation communities. It was home to rare and threatened plants and animals, including the Eastern pygmy possum, several species of honeyeaters and the firetail. He said the deal coincided with a $2m upgrade of the Royal Coastal Track between Bundeena and Marley.  Description  The coastal cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms are located around separate beaches in the southern area of Royal National Park (RNP). Access is only on foot, either around the rocks from Garie Beach in the north or down Burgh ridge from the Garawarra carpark. Each community has a distinctive visual character reflecting particular histories and topography but is generally defined by tight groupings of cabins within cleared grassed areas that are backed by the dense rainforest escarpment and separated by headlands. The 20 cabins at Little Garie are located on the southern side of Black Gin Gully and sheltered from southerly winds by Thelma Head. Era is the largest group with 95 cabins in distinct groupings around Mid Era Point at the north end of Era Beach, Semi Detached Point at the south end of the beach and around Era Gully. The close proximity of cabins on Semi Detached Point reflects an historic association with mining families from Helensburgh who first built on this hill; hence the alternative name for this area, Burgh Hill. The location of the 28 cabins on and near the headland at the northern end of Burning Palms Beach reflects a period when cabins were moved from behind Burning Palms Beach with the creation of Garawarra State Park in 1934. A cabin is a particular type of residence that is between a hut and a cottage in size and is usually associated with temporary accommodation as a coastal weekender. Typical RNP coastal cabins are one or two room single level structures constructed with a light timber frame with either asbestos cement, corrugated iron or weatherboard external cladding; often with an unlined interior. Roofs are usually of a gable form, often with a skillion portion over an enclosed verandah. The roofs are usually clad in corrugated iron and are often unlined internally. A number of the cabins are an unusual design and construction, some utilising local stone and other recycled and locally found materials that have distinctive aesthetic qualities that express highly individualised design tastes. Many cabins contain technology dating to the 1930s, including kerosene fridges and stoves. In addition to the traditional form of the cabins, other traditional vernacular features include the external expression of an enclosure for fuel stove cookers, bucket shower enclosures and a pit toilet nearby. Notwithstanding current regulations prohibiting the use of local wood and the advent of modern technologies such as LPG cooking and solar lighting, many cabins deliberately retain examples of these earlier societal technologies as part of a cabin heritage experience and for passing down the knowledge to subsequent generations. Within the settings of many cabins are beer bottle retaining walls, toilets, fireplaces and washing lines and introduced plants such as aloe and oleander. The lack of fencing and roads make a distinctive aesthetic for groupings of buildings of such numbers. The isolated locations of these communities that required material to be carried in and the nature of tenure has meant that cabins have been constructed and repaired with a wide variety of recycled materials and materials found on site (e.g. driftwood, flotsam and local stone). The exposed coastal location necessitates continual ongoing repair and maintenance, further enhancing the eclectic character of cabin fabric. Whilst the curtilage for their heritage listing is a distinct boundary around each cabin community (excluding the Era and Burning Palms Surf Life Saving Clubs) that encompasses all cabins within each of the three nominated areas of Burning Palms, Little Garie and South Era, it is noted that this curtilage is set within a broader landscape setting that provides for key views to and from the cabin areas and includes the escarpment above the communities, the Burgh and Thelma ridges and Garawarra carpark. = Condition = Most of the cabins were reported to be in good condition and are regularly maintained by their owners as at 20 September 2011. The current licence provides for the cabins to be maintained within agreed standards with strict limitations imposed on the nature and extent of change permissible.OEH Conditions Standards 2003 Given the maritime location and simple nature of construction, continual protective maintenance, including the need for fabric replacement over time, is both necessary and an important characteristic of the cabins' significance. The archaeological sites and features of the cabin areas (including those that relate to pastoral activities at North Era) have the ability to yield information about the occupation and development of these areas over time. The archaeological resource forms part of the built fabric and form of the sites and provides evidence of local design and adaptation to buildings and their surroundings. Individual items such as garbage scatters and pits, construction techniques and materials of the cabins and related structures, wells, long drop toilets etc, possess scientific and research potential.DEC 2005:97 The overall integrity of the cabin communities remains high. Between 1953, when cabin numbers were at their highest, and 1990 when a moratorium on cabin removals was instigated by the then National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), approximately 55 cabins were removed. These losses have not impacted the overall integrity of the collective size or \\"critical mass\\" of the groups. Currently, one cabin at Era is a \\"stabilised ruin\\" due to a dispute between its owners and OEH which has not allowed the building to be repaired or occupied. Two cabins at Burning Palms are required to be removed by the OEH due to geotechnical issues. The Burning Palms community wishes to relocate or rebuild these cabins in another environmentally appropriate site; however OEH is considering whether this is appropriate. = Modifications and dates = Prior to the original Permissive Occupancy agreements in the 1950s many cabins were altered with small additions or with the infill of verandahs. However, since that time the external footprints and external form have remained generally intact and are now controlled by the current licence agreements and condition standards. As noted above, fabric repair and fabric change is a necessity because of remoteness and the maritime location and is also part of the character and significance of the cabins. This aspect is recognised in the Conditions Standards that form part of the current licences. Alternative technologies and adaptation to changing technology (such as solar systems) are also cabin characteristics and appropriate change in technology is recognised in the Conditions Standards that form part of the current licences. Policies prohibiting the collection of firewood have seen many cabins change from traditional outdoor and indoor wood fire cooking to gas fired BBQs and stoves.  Heritage listing  The Royal National Park (RNP) coastal cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms are of State heritage significance as the largest and most intact groups of vernacular coastal weekender cabins remaining in NSW. Cabin communities were once common along the coast of NSW and the groups at Little Garie (20 cabins), South Era (95 cabins) and Burning Palms (28 cabins) are now rare in the State context and along with the Bulgo group in RNP are likely to represent a small number of similar cabin groups remaining in Australia. These cabin communities are historically important in a NSW context as evidence of the development of a distinctive way of life associated with recreation from the middle parts of the twentieth century, once common in coastal NSW but now rare. The cabins provide evidence of the development of simple weekender accommodation around Sydney from the 1920s and 1930s starting with tent accommodation that developed into huts and cabins. The cabins also reflect the embracing of Sydney's bush hinterland in the early part of the twentieth century and the reciprocal role the bush had in the development of recreation and conservation philosophy in NSW. The cabin communities represent a type of simple weekend escape from Sydney now rare because of changing recreation lifestyles, conservation requirements and development pressure. The cabin communities are part of an important landscape demonstrating key phases in the history of Royal National Park including Aboriginal occupation, pastoralism, agriculture and recreation uses. The latter began in the 1920s, continued during the Depression period and intensified during and immediately after the Second World War, reflecting important social and workplace reforms in NSW at that time that provided more leisure time (State Significance). The historical associations of the coastal cabin communities encompass both the Sydney and Illawarra regions, with some of these associations extending back to the 1920s. The cabins themselves are significant for their continuity of use and associations, most of them for over sixty years. Historical associations are found with the northern Illawarra mining community of Helensburgh in particular, and this association is reflected most strongly in the Burgh Hill area of Era. There are strong historical associations between the Surf Life Saving clubs formed in each cabin area, with other clubs in the Sydney metropolitan area and with other emergency rescue services. The cabin communities are significant for their long historic associations with important designers, artists, musicians, writers and poets over time including Gordon Andrews, Max Dupain, Hal Missingham, David Moore and more recently Chris O'Doherty aka Reg Mombasa (Local Significance). The cabin communities demonstrate aesthetic and creative achievement with the combination of large village-like groupings of a now rare vernacular building type located within dramatic landscape settings of cleared former pastoral areas separated by erodible cliffs and backed by the rainforest escarpment. These distinctive cabin landscapes have no direct comparison in terms of scale and setting in NSW. A number of the cabins have distinctive aesthetic qualities reflecting highly individualised design tastes and the use of local stone and other recycled materials (State Significance). The cabin communities have social significance because of the breadth of direct associations across a broad regional area, the strength of ties and sense of identity within each cabin community associated with the cabins lifestyle, its values and a strong sense of place in the landscape and for individual and family associations. The strong family and individual associations with the cabins reflect, in many cases, continuous associations for four generations. The relative isolation of the cabin communities, not accessible by car, has influenced the physical and social nature of these communities (Local Significance). The cabin communities have the potential to yield information that will contribute to a further understanding of the historic, aesthetic and social values of the cabin communities. Changing attitudes to conservation and recreation in RNP, research on changes in the design use of cabins and the social dynamics within the cabin communities are examples of potential research relating the historic, aesthetic and social values of these communities (Local Significance). The cabin communities represent a rare recreation lifestyle and architecture that is becoming uncommon in Australia and rare in a NSW context. The visibility of historic landscape layers, the scale of the cabin groups and their dramatic landscape settings have produced a rare series of recreational cultural landscapes in a NSW context. There are no similar sized groups of weekender cabin communities remaining in NSW, apart from the Bulgo group at the southern end of RNP (State Significance). While the cabin areas are representative of the principal characteristics of NSW mid-twentieth century vernacular weekender architecture on public coastal land, the particular history, strength and breadth of social associations and the size and settings and groupings of these cabin groups are unusual and outstanding in a NSW context (State Significance). The historic, aesthetic, rarity and representative values most strongly contribute to the overall State significance of the Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms cabin communities. Royal National Park Coastal Cabin Communities was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 April 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms are historically important in a NSW context as evidence of the development of a distinctive way of life associated with particular recreation and leisure pastimes from the middle parts of the twentieth century, once common on coastal NSW but now rare. Along with the Bulgo group in RNP, these three groups are the largest and most intact examples of weekender cabin communities remaining in NSW. The cabin communities are part of an important landscape demonstrating key phases in the history of Royal National Park including Aboriginal occupation, pastoralism and agriculture but particularly recreation uses that started in the 1920s, continued during the Depression period and intensified during and immediately after the Second World War. The cabins are significant for their continuity of use for over fifty years. The cabins provide evidence of the development of simple weekender accommodation around Sydney from the 1920s and 1930s, starting with tent accommodation and developing into huts and cabins. The cabins also reflect the embracing of Sydney's bush hinterland in the early part of the twentieth century and the reciprocal role the bush had in the development of recreation and conservation philosophy in NSW. The rapid growth in cabin numbers from the mid-1940s reflect important social and workplace reforms in NSW at that time that provided more leisure time. The cabin communities are historically significant in demonstrating links between Sydney and the Illawarra, in particular the northern Illawarra coal mining town of Helensburgh and southern Sydney suburbs. It was Helensburgh miners and their families who first visited the area and stayed for extended periods during the Depression. Bushwalkers from Sydney joined the Helensburgh families as car and public transport assisted access to the area. The RNP cabins and cabins lifestyle represent unique historic patterns of use that reflect self regulated communities operating within, and effected by, the nature of tenure and the actions of various external agencies (land trustee, Park Trustee and NPWS/OEH) and other stakeholders (including national parks and conservation stakeholder groups) that have strongly influenced the physical and social character of the cabin communities. These historic patterns and influences are reflected in the cabins landscapes where individual freedom has been tempered by community responsibilities (both local and broad) and other controls and restrictions arising from their location within an iconic national park. The history of the cabins community reflects important aspects of NSW community and social history where both diverse and minority viewpoints and lifestyles were tolerated at a time when they were not supported with the mainstream community. The cabin communities are an important aspect of the history of Royal National Park itself. The establishment of nature conservation groups is a key aspect of the identified national values of RNP and the tension between nature conservation and recreation management, including the future of the cabins, is a major theme in the history of Royal National Park. The cabins and extent of the cabin community areas are evidence of the extension of the National Park (later Royal National Park) in 1950 and the commitment of the then government to conserve important landscapes in response to the lobbying of both nature conservation and cabins groups (State Significant). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The historical associations of the coastal cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms encompass both the Sydney and Illawarra regions, with some of these associations extending back to the 1920s and most being continuous since the 1940s. Broad historical associations are found with the northern Illawarra mining communities generally and that of Helensburgh in particular. This association is reflected most strongly in the Burgh Hill area of Era. There are strong historical associations between the Surf Life Saving clubs formed in each cabin area with other clubs in the Sydney metropolitan area and with other emergency rescue services. There have been historical associations between the cabin communities and the observance of ANZAC Day ceremonies, with dawn services held regularly at places such as Little Garie. The cabin communities are associated with early Sydney and Illawarra bushwalking groups who joined with cabin owners to lobby for the extension of the national park in the 1940s, although at times the bushwalking groups have lobbied to have the cabins removed. The cabins are significant for their long historic associations with artists, musicians, writers and poets over time including Gordon Andrews, Max Dupain, Hal Missingham, Margret Olley, David Moore, Roland Robinson and more recently Chris O'Doherty aka Reg Mombasa. While connected with a wide variety of people and groups of broad significance in the Sydney region, the cabins communities are not considered to meet this criterion at a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms demonstrate aesthetic and creative achievement from the combination of large village-like groupings of a now rare vernacular building type located within dramatic landscape settings of cleared former pastoral areas separated by erodible cliffs and backed by the rainforest escarpment. These distinctive cabin landscapes have no direct comparison in terms of scale and setting in NSW. The weekender cabin that evolved in the early part of the twentieth century is unusual as a building type in terms of both design and use. These particular examples are important reflections of this period and use; although they were constructed relatively free from specific design controls, later change was limited by licence controls and the lack of tenure and this assisted the preservation of vernacular characteristics and use. The repetitive patterning of building styles and materials demonstrates the communal and traditional nature of construction and the limitations imposed by the natural environment and isolated locations of the cabins areas. The changes over time in materials, including those recycled and from the sites, as well as changes in technology, reflect creative achievement and adaptability and a creative and technical response to site and place. A number of the cabins are examples of highly individualised design styles and tastes, utilising local stone and other recycled and locally found materials in a distinctive manner that reflects a high level of creative achievement (State significant). The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms have social significance at a State level because of the breadth of direct associations across a broad regional area, the strength of ties and sense of identity within the cabin community areas associated with the cabins lifestyle, and sense of place in the landscape and the continuous and strong family associations, in many cases for four generations. Parts of the cabins area localities have particular importance to the Dharawal people as burial sites. The coastal edge surrounding the cabin areas remains an important fishery for the local Aboriginal community, particularly the Wadi Wadi people of the Illawarra at Wollongong and La Perouse and other Dharawal people of the south coast. The cabins areas contain sites that have cultural, spiritual and social associations with Dharawal people and local community associations such as the Illawarra Local Aboriginal Land Council and La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council. The cabin areas have social value for the long term visitors and users of these areas for recreational activities from Sydney and the Illawarra, in particular the northern Illawarra coal mining communities and southern Sydney/Sutherland communities. The Helensburgh community has had a strong and continuous association with Era in particular for over sixty years and many Helensburgh families have had associations with particular cabins for at least four generations. The Surf Life Saving clubs at Burning Palms, Era and the one at Garie Beach with which Little Garie is associated have high social value for the services that they have provided over many decades to both cabin users and recreational users of the cabin areas generally. The surf clubs are a strong focus for a community identity and sense of place over this long period and are also strongly associated with the surf life saving movement generally and with certain Sydney metropolitan clubs in particular. The group of people that make up each cabin community area have strong community ties and hold in high esteem the values of the cabins and their history. The members of each cabin community have a strong collective association with these scenic but isolated places and the particular lifestyle involved, including the transfer of generational values and of self sufficiency, respect for different values and beliefs and shared obligations for issues such as track maintenance and surf lifesaving. Social significance at a community level is also reflected in the collective efforts to respond to the various issues that have arisen and through the efforts of the Cabins Protection League and the Surf Clubs. The cabins provide a strong sense of identity for the families of cabin owners, many of whom now have four generations of direct and continuous associations with the cabins. People now come from all over NSW and Australia with several cabin owners living as far afield as Darwin and Tasmania. The cabins also have social significance associated with a sense of loss for those families who had licences terminated and cabins removed prior to 1990 or for those who have lost family members closely associated with particular cabins. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cabin communities of Little Garie, Era and Burning Palms have the potential to yield information that will contribute to a further understanding of the historic, aesthetic and social values of the cabin communities. Changing attitudes to conservation and recreation in RNP, research on changes in the design and use of cabins and the social dynamics within the cabin communities are examples of potential research relating the historic, aesthetic and social values of these cabin communities. The nature and diversity of the Aboriginal archaeological sites within RNP and the cabin areas has the potential to contribute to our understanding of pre-Contact Aboriginal occupation of the south coast of NSW. The cabins areas have the potential to yield information on the evolution of coastal ecology and regeneration within a concentrated culturally modified area. The cabins areas have the potential to yield information on the development of the vernacular weekender cabin as a mid-twentieth century architectural style. Many of the cabins contain rare fabric, design and siting details from the first phases of establishment during the 1930s (demonstrating the evolution of the cabins from weekend recreation use to permanent structures). The cabins have the potential to yield information on the use and maintenance of early twentieth century technology now becoming rare such as kerosene ovens, stoves, lamps and fridges. The cabin areas also have the potential to yield information on communities that developed and maintained their own water, power and waste systems in non road accessible locations without government supplied services. The archaeological features of the cabins areas such as the various paths and tracks and beer bottle retaining walls have potential to yield information about the use and development the areas (Local Significance). The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because the cabin communities represent a rare recreation lifestyle and architecture that is becoming uncommon in Australia and rare in a NSW context. The visibility of historic landscape layers, the scale of the cabin groups and their dramatic landscape settings have produced a rare series of recreational cultural landscapes in a NSW context. There are no similar sized groups of weekender cabin communities remaining in NSW, apart from the Bulgo group at the southern end of RNP. Particular historical, administrative and locational circumstances have shaped the physical and social composition of these large groups in a manner not found elsewhere. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The cabin areas are of Significance because they are representative of the principal characteristics of other NSW mid-twentieth century vernacular weekenders on public coastal land such as Mullet Creek, Dark Corner-Patonga, Crater Cove, Bonnie Vale and Boat Harbour- Kurnell. The particular history, strength and breadth of social associations and the size and settings and groupings of these cabin groups are unusual and in the opinion of the cabin community outstanding in a NSW context. The history of the cabin groups are representative of the key historic themes in the history of RNP, a nationally listed place; the size and differing cultural and community backgrounds of these cabins communities is unusual and the remoteness of the groups has resulted in particular constraints not demonstrated in other examples. These other groups are either more spread out (Mullet Creek), represent quite different histories (Crater Cove), and administration and construction (Bonnie Vale).

It was built from 1950 to 1951 by Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd. The surviving remnants of the hostel are Huts 201, 204 and 210. It is also known as the Fairy Meadow Migrant Hostel. The site is now used for student accommodation as part of the University of Wollongong's Campus East. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2009.  History  The buildings numbered 201, 204, and 210 are remnants of the Balgownie Migrant Workers Hostel. The Hostel was constructed in late 1950 and 1951 as a migrant workers hostel to meet the demand for housing created by a Commonwealth government policy for increased immigration. At the same time around the rest of the state there were numerous other hostels built to meet the demands brought about by the immigration policy. The Balgownie Migrant Hostel was built by Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd, the contract being let in October 1950 and occupied in December 1951. The hostel was later renamed Fairy Meadow Migrant Hostel and continued operation until 1982. The property was purchased by the University of Wollongong for student accommodation in June 1987. About 1989 the building known as 201 a former dining hall was converted for use as the Science Centre. The first Nissen Hut was designed by Canadian Lieutenant Colonel Peter Norman Nissen in 1916. In World War II the Nissen Hut design was modified and extensively used in military activities. The British Nissen Hut was copied by Americans in the Quonset hut and evolved to become quite different by the end of WWII. The buildings numbered 201, 204 and 210 are remnants of the hostel completed in 1951. They were part of a large complex of huts divided into blocks around common dining room and laundry buildings.  Description  ;Building 201 Former Migrant Hostel Kitchen/Dining Room, then a university science centre and currently conserved, refurbished and used as a child care facility. The building has three parts: a single storey weatherboard clad kitchen area with clerestory ventilation; a Quonset hut with curved corrugated steel roof/walls; a gable roofed corrugated steel clad extension ;Building 204 Former Migrant hostel Laundry Exchange, next the university library/ bookstore and now conserved and ready for occupation by unspecified university services. The building has two parts. The western section is a Nissen hut. The eastern section 1980 concrete block and metal deck structure. ;Building 210 Former Migrant Hostel staff residence, now conserved, refurbished and awaiting occupation by unspecified university services. This is a Quonset hut. = Condition = The condition of the buildings was reported to be excellent as at 14 September 2006, following thorough conservation carried out in 2004/5. The larger Quonset hut (building 201) is in use as a childcare facility. Buildings 204 and 210 are ready for occupation by University of Wollongong services. Buildings 204 and 210 have been moved from their former flood-prone location to a raised berm near building 201. Improved site drainage protects building 201 from all but one- in-one-hundred-year flooding. There is little archaeological potential however there is substantial documentary evidence available, and former residents of the hostel still around to be able to tell the story of the site without the need for archaeological work. The huts are reasonably intact. = Modifications and dates = Since closure of the Hostel, in 1982, the buildings had been adapted, some repeatedly, for use by the University of Wollongong. All three buildings were conserved in 2005. The larger Quonset hut (building 201) is in use as a childcare facility. Buildings 204 and 210 are ready for occupation by University of Wollongong services. In 2005, buildings 204 and 210 were moved from their former flood-prone location to a raised berm immediately to the west of building 201. The berm also protects building 210 from flooding on its western side while improved site drainage to the north and east protects it from all but one-in-one-hundred-year flooding.  Heritage listing  The Nissen hut (building 204) and the two Quonset huts (buildings 201 and 210) have historical significance as physical evidence of the Balgownie Migrant Workers Hostel that was constructed at Fairy Meadow in 1950 and 1951 (and in use until 1982) as part of an Australia-wide post-World War II immigration program. This immigration program had wide-ranging impacts upon the development and growth of Wollongong. The two Nissen huts and one Quonset are locally rare, as other buildings of the period have not survived at the other Wollongong migrant hostel sites set up at that time (in Unanderra and Berkeley). They are also rare on a Statewide basis as surviving Nissen and Quonset huts adapted for use at a former New South Wales migrant hostel site. These structures have an historical association with author Mary Rose Liverani and with the community of migrants who started their Australian life at the hostel before moving on to become influential in the economic and cultural life of Wollongong. The buildings have some technical significance relating to the adaptation of Nissen and Quonset huts which have been modified for use at a migrant hostel location. The buildings and their location have social significance due to the community of past residents and their descendants who have strong emotional ties to the site and still live in the Wollongong district. Balgownie Migrant Workers Hostel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 August 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. These buildings are the only physical evidence on site of the former Balgownie Migrant Workers Hostel as built in 1951. The pattern of migration after WWII is clearly evidenced by these buildings. The history of the development of Australia and particularly Wollongong was heavily influenced by migration. The evidence of migration at this period is rare. Nissen and Quonset huts were commonly used at hostel sites throughout NSW however there are very few examples surviving today. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The subject site has been the subject of a number of works of literature. Notably \\"the Winter Sparrows\\" by Mary Rose Liverani who documents her own experiences of growing up at the hostel. There is a significant community surviving today who have very strong connection with the former hostel. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Nissen and Quonset huts have some technical interest as examples of World War ii period prefabricated buildings which have been adapted for migrant hostel use. These buildings are the only surviving landmarks of the former Balgownie Migrant Workers Hostel. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Wollongong community has a large number of people who were post-war migrants or are descended from post war migrants. This community has demonstrated esteem for these buildings through groups such as the Migration Heritage Project. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Nissen and Quonset huts are good examples of prefabricated post World War II buildings which have been adapted for uses such as accommodation, laundry, dining and administration at a migrant hostel. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The buildings are the only surviving evidence of a migrant hostel in the local area. They are also rare at a state level as only known surviving Nissen and Quonset huts at a migrant hostel site. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Buildings 201, 204 and 210 are relatively intact examples of Nissen and Quonset huts previously used as a migrant hostel. They exemplify the era of Government sponsored post-war migration to Australia and the provisions for implementation of that policy. As landmarks these structures are held in high esteem by the community, particularly by the descendants of the migrants themselves, many of whom continue to live in the area.

It was designed by Reginald J. Magoffin with an interior by Marion Hall Best and built from 1950 to 1954. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 May 2005.  History  =Herbert Wyndham Jones and Maurice Jones= Herbert Wyndham Jones was an important pioneer of the film exhibition industry in the Illawarra Region. Originally a storekeeper, he turned entrepreneur and by October 1930 he was leasing the Princess Theatre at Corrimal, a former boxing stadium. The Great Depression was having a major impact on the people in the Illawarra and the theatre was functioning as a Relief Centre. Jones undertook extensive repairs to the theatre in 1931 at great expense and it is concluded that \\"there may have been an element of civic duty in providing further opportunities for the growing numbers of unemployed to enjoy the escapism of the movies\\"Robert Parkinson, Gauffered Velour). Contrary to prevailing trends, Jones re-opened the theatre as a silent movie house but by September 1931 talkies were introduced. In mid 1931 Jones purchased the Princess Theatre for the sum of 1,400 pounds. The theatre remained in the Jones Family hands for forty-one years of its fifty-nine year life and was destroyed by fire in September 1971. In 1933, Herbert Jones came to the rescue of the Balgownie School of Arts Committee which had faced an increasingly difficult time during the Great Depression and re-commenced film screenings in September 1933. The hall survives to the present day but film screenings ceased in April 1960. In the early 1940s Jones commenced a regular 16mm picture show in the Miners' Reading Room in Kembla Heights and on Herbert's death in March 1943 his son Maurice continued the screenings until April 1950. In 1938 Herbert Jones submitted a successful bid for a seven year lease for the showing of pictures at Wollongong Council's Town Hall Theatre and Council proceeded with renovations and improvements to the building designed by Crick and Furse in association with Mr & Mrs Jones. Delays with the licensing of the theatre postponed its re-opening till October 1939. Jones introduced a number of innovations at this time - \\"deaf aids\\", emphasis on the screening of Australian productions and a preparedness to pay higher rental fees for premium films and to introduce daily matinees and extended seasons. Following his death, Herbert Jones' wife continued as the licensee of the Town Hall (Civic Theatre) until its closure in 1964. Other innovations and technological advancements introduced by the Jones Family at the Civic Theatre were the installation of a new Western Electric sound system in 1951, the introduction of foreign-language films to the district commencing with La Ronde in 1953 and the VistaVision process in 1954 with a second large screen. Robert Parkinson concluded \\"Not least, it (the Civic Theatre) allowed the Jones family to innovate for the benefit of picture goers, a technique that would be developed further at the Regent.\\"(Robert Parkinson, Gauffered Velour) =Regent Theatre= In 1934 Herbert Jones bought a block of land on the eastern side of Keira Street, between Crown and Market Streets, with the intention of erecting a picture theatre. In September 1935, architect Reginald John Magoffin of Sydney submitted plans to the Chief Secretary for a theatre measuring 130 feet by 84 feet behind an open courtyard itself measuring 120 feet by 40 feet. Revised plans submitted in April 1936 showed dressing rooms, fly tower, stage 45 feet by 16 feet, auditorium 70 feet by 102 feet (height 36 feet), courtyard as before, bio box at rear of circle, brick building, galvanized roof on steel trusses, and 1569 seats. Following Chief Secretary approval, Jones launched a new company called South Coast Theatres Ltd, with authorised capital of 50,000 pounds (of which 20,000 pounds was to be raised in public shares) for the purpose of \\"erecting a Picture Theatre on Freehold Land situated in Keira Street, Wollongong the land is recognised as a very fine site for a Theatre will be of the latest design, modern in every particular. Special features will be the approach, comfortable seating, spacious lounges, winter garden, and ultra modern lighting effects. The Auditorium being set back from Keira Street will eliminate traffic noises, and be of material advantage to the acoustics with the present population there is already ample scope for a further Picture Theatre, and with the continuous increase, it will become a necessity, to cope with the number of theatregoers, many of whom at present are frequently unable to obtain seats. It is proposed to extend the operations of the Company on the South Coast after the theatre is well established in Wollongong as local conditions develop, the Management will probably be able to increase the average receipts by providing a more or less continuous series of Star Pictures, and so increase the takings and net profits beyond the figures shown ..\\"Prospectus of South Coast Theatres Ltd issued 14th March, 1936 The prospectus also contained an architect's impression of the courtyard and auditorium exterior. The building that was eventually erected bore little resemblance to the 1936 ambitious plan. On the Chief Secretary's inquiring about the lack of building progress in late 1938, Jones claimed that industrial, financial and political conditions had prevented work commencing. A case for not withdrawing approval was also put by Ernest Sommerlad MLC who later in 1945 was one of the key founders of the National Trust of Australia (NSW). By November 1939 he notified the Chief Secretary that war has now intervened. \\"At present I am concerned with an attempt made by Wollongong Theatres Ltd to enter Balgownie in opposition to my existing holding and when this matter is disposed of I will give further consideration to the Keira Street proposition\\".Letter from H. W. Jones, 17th November, 1939 While war now provided Mr Jones with a good excuse, it seems likely that he had been keeping officialdom at bay in the absence of sufficient finance that the company had failed to raise. Jones did not live to see the project commenced, let alone completed, for he died in March 1943. His wife, Emily Vaughan Jones and his son, Maurice, took over the picture business. In February 1947 they re-activated the Keira Street project and were then subject to processes of the Theatres and Films Commission. On this occasion, however, opposition did not arise and the Commission approved the project. Magoffin updated his plans to provide for rented offices over the vestibule, instead of an open courtyard, claiming as a precedent the erection of the Sydney Prince Edward Theatre auditorium over the vestibule. Construction of offices was intended to bring in much needed funds for the later construction of the auditorium. Building work commenced in February 1950 but progress was very slow and the offices were not completed until 1954. It was commonly believed at the time by local observers as the vestibule was being constructed that it was in fact the theatre itself. But the even larger building which subsequently rose behind the vestibule was gradually recognised to be the theatre auditorium. The vestibule, with its \\"glamorous wall and ceiling treatment\\"(R. Irving) was the work of the acclaimed interior designers Marion Hall Best and Janet Single. Marion Hall Best who was born in 1905 became one of the first independent decorators operating in Sydney. By the time she closed her business in 1974 she had established a reputation as \\"high priestess of the avant-garde\\".(Catriona Quinn) The Best style was \\"characterised by an adventurous and sophisticated use of colour in glazed walls and ceilings, international modernist and Australian furniture, Japanese temple blinds and lights and marimekko cottons and Jim Thompson Thai Silks. Best's other significant public commissions included The Lobby Restaurant, Canberra and a consultancy on the seating fabrics and outdoor furniture for the Sydney Opera House. Theatre patrons had to wait until Boxing Day 1957 for the theatre's opening - twenty-three years since the land was purchased for this purpose. Highlights of the theatre's operation were * the first cinemascope screening in 1961, * the installation of a Westrex Stereophonic Sound system in August 1963 for the presentation of the movie \\"South Pacific\\", * a new giant curved screen (32 feet by 19 feet) for the Todd-AO production \\"My Fair Lady\\" in October, 1967 (the screen was renewed in June, 1976), * in the biobox two Phillips Cinemeccanica 70mm projectors * and in more recent years Dolby system speakers at the rear of the lower circle and on side walls. The Theatre is a remarkable monument to an enterprising family of the Illawarra district and remained in the family's control until the death of Herbert Jones' daughter, Rowena Milgrove. Her death in January 2004 came 20 days before she was due to close the cinema permanently for financial reasons. The building had been faced with the threat of demolition in 2002, when Lendlease raised the possibility of demolishing the building as part of a redevelopment of Wollongong Central. The plans did not proceed. The Gateway City Church bought the 1200-seat theatre for $3.5 million in 2005, then spent $1 million on improvements, also turning the space into an occasional live music venue. The building was placed on the market in October 2009, in a surprise sale bid that came to nothing. In 2016, the owners of the building painted the beloved landmark olive green, after heritage investigations confirmed this was the facade's original colour. In August 2017, the Gateway City Church advertised the building for sale, announcing that they had outgrown the building. Media reports in June 2018 indicated that the building had found a buyer and was under contract, and that while the identity of the buyer could not be revealed at that stage, they intended to \\"occupy it and reinvigorate it as a theatre\\".Crabb, 2017  Description  The Regent facade is of robust geometrical composition of Functionalist and Art Deco Forms. The theatre auditorium is \\"beautifully simple\\" (Robert Irving) with a criss-cross ceiling pattern of plaster moulding featuring hundreds of star-lights. The ceiling curves and at the sides disappears into a plaster trough which was itself originally designed to house concealed lighting, The auditorium ceiling and walls are painted gray-green in strong contrast to the orange-red house curtain. The proscenium is surrounded by a plain plaster trough in which concealed lighting has now been disconnected. On each side of the auditorium a plaster moulding depicts a mythological scene beneath the gilt rays of a star or sun in the form of a round opalescent glass covering for an electric light which never seems to have been lit. The view from the stage reveals clusters of lights under the circle balcony, Dolby stereo speakers at the rear of the lower circle and on sidewalls, and the projection room at the rear of the circle. The projection box holds an \\"impressive\\" (Robert Parkinson) array of equipment - two Westrex machines (no longer in use) and two Philips Todd-AO DP-70 projectors manufactured in Eindhoven, Holland with the manufacturing serial numbers 2377 and 2382. In this respect they are similar to the projectors that Hoyts Theatres installed in their Sydney Mayfair and Paris Theatres. (Greg Beasley) Other equipment includes a slide projector and the \\"usual accoutrements of such a nerve centre.\\" (Robert Parkinson) The Keira Street entrance to the Regent is through five double glass doors that lead into a 120-foot terrazzo floored vestibule. On the left of the vestibule are display cases and on the right a long candy bar, ticket office and managerial suite. The brilliant multi-coloured glazing of walls and ceiling was the work of (Lady) Marion Hall Best, acclaimed Australian interior designer, with assistance of Janet Single. The unusually glamorous effect is enhanced at the far end by several pendant pumpkin-shaped lanterns, placed at irregular intervals and heights. At each side of the divided staircase to the mezzanine lounge are smaller ticket boxes (no longer used) and doors to the stalls, in this theatre called the \\"lower circle\\", a term that had been peculiar to the rival company Wollongong Theatres but, in this case, adopted by the competitor for the whole ground floor seating area. The mezzanine lounge is a vast space underneath the Dress Circle whose exposed supporting beams thrust the sloping ceiling upward. The decor here has a pronounced oriental motif in the bamboo papered ceiling, the tropical pot plants, and rear-lit paper screens of the candy bar. At each end of this \\"Grand Assembly\\" a split-level staircase leads to the dress circle and a breathtaking view of the starry auditorium ceiling. The Regent \\"reveals many overseas influences including the \\"atmospheric\\" theatre type\\" (Greater Wollongong Heritage Study) It appears to reflect the architectural style of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, 1938/39 by Edward Durrell Stone. = Condition = The theatre was reported as intact, in good condition and well maintained as at 11 June 2002.Greater Wollongong Heritage Study 1989 and National Trust inspection, 2000 = Modifications and dates = The only superficial changes that have occurred are that the awnings neon sign has disappeared, new \\"fairy\\" lighting was installed in the ceiling above the street entrance and a fountain has been removed from the foyer (following vandalism) to be replaced by an attractively decorative panel of flora and fauna.  Heritage listing  The Regent Theatre is of State heritage significance for the rare and outstanding interior design of its foyer and mezzanine areas by Marion Hall Best. This was a major commission for a public space by one of Australia's leading modernist interior designers, and one of the few intact examples remaining of Best's signature \\"glazing\\" paintwork. The Regent is also of State significance as an intact and outstanding example of mid-twentieth century professional women's design in NSW. The Regent Theatre is also of State significance for being a rare and intact large capacity cinema. The building and its facade were designed in the Art Deco style by Reginald Magoffin in the mid 1930s although it was not actually built until the mid 1950s. The theatre has significance associated with the introduction of wide screen technology to cinemas in NSW . It still retains its wide screen format and large scale picture palace style auditorium. The Regent also has local significance for its historical associations with Herbert Wyndham Jones, since it represents the culmination of his entrepreneurial endeavours in cinema management in the Illawarra region. The Regent has social significance for the thousands of people from the region who formed its audiences over half a century. Regent Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Regent Theatre is of State significance as a rare, large capacity cinema. It is a local manifestation of mid twentieth century Art Deco movie theatre construction in NSW, demonstrating the cultural importance and growth of this form of popular entertainment in this area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Regent Theatre is of State significance for its historical associations with Marion Hall Best who did all the interior design. Best's design for the theatre was one of her more significant public commissions and is one of the few surviving examples of her work. A leading practitioner of the avante guarde, Marion Hall Best was one of the most significant and influential interior designers in the twentieth century in Australia. In addition, the Regent Theatre is of high local significance for its historical associations with Herbert Wyndham Jones and his family, including his daughter Rowena Milgrove who managed the cinema for three decades. The theatre represents the culmination of Jones' entrepreneurial endeavours in cinema management in the Illawarra region. Jones pioneered film exhibition in the silent movie days and provided vital entertainment in the days of the Great Depression. His family carried on the business after his death in 1943, introducing innovations and technical advancements in theatres in the region. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Regent Theatre at Keira Street Wollongong is likely to be of State significance for the rare and outstanding interior design of its foyer and mezzanine areas by Marion Hall Best. This was a major commission for a public space by one of Australia's leading modernist interior designers, and one of the few intact examples remaining of Best's signature \\"glazing\\" paintwork. With Best working on the interiors with the assistance of her architect niece, Janet Single, the Regent Theatre is further likely to be of State significance as an intact and outstanding example of mid-twentieth century women's design in NSW. Its aesthetic significance is enhanced by the almost totally intact nature of the interior and exterior of the theatre. The Regent Theatre retains its original large capacity cinema auditorium and wide screen format making the theatre one of the increasingly small number of picture palace style cinema theatres in NSW retaining their original configuration. The historic dimensions of the auditorium are of State significance rather than its technology. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Regent is of high social significance for the thousands of people from the region who formed its audiences over half a century. The concerted community action in response to reports of its proposed demolition is a sign of the high esteem in which it is held. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Regent Theatre is of local significance as a surviving large scale early cinema. It marks the introduction of wide-screen technology in NSW cinemas and still retains its original orientation and layout The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Regent Theatre is of State significance for the rarity and intactness of its interior design by Marion Hall Best, which may be her only surviving commercial interior. It is one of the few intact grand cinemas remaining in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Regent is of high local significance for being a rare, intact and representative cinema from the 1950s when the theatre industry was broadening its horizons with the use of \\"Cinemascope\\" technology.

Family Havig was born at the Havika farm in Overhalla in the Namdalen district, now in the municipality of Namsos. When he was still a child, his family moved to Vikna. In 1854 he married Dorthea Karstine Nergaard (1831‚Äì1915), from Seierstad on the island of J√∏a. He was the father of the Liberal Party Storting representative Christian Fredrik Nergaard Havig (1855‚Äì1927) and the bailiff in Vefsn Thorleiv Nergaard Havig (1867‚Äì1938). Life Apart from the instruction in the ambulatory school (omgangsskole) taught by a traveling schoolmaster, Havig received little formal education. Nonetheless, he managed to learn enough on his own that he was accepted for office work for the bailiff in N√¶r√∏y and Vikna. Later he was employed by his cousin, the bailiff J√∏rgen Johannes Havig in Namsos, who was a member of the Storting. Here he served for a period as the town's mayor and settlement commissioner (forlikskommiss√¶r). In 1848, he was appointed as an assistant to the district judge in Namdalen, where he remained until 1858, when he was appointed bailiff in Vefsn in Nordland. This position lasted until 1904, when he was succeeded by his son, Thorleiv Nergaard Havig. In 1871, Havig was elected Storting representative for Nordland County, and he was reelected for the following parliamentary sessions until 1888. From 1871 to 1874, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Justice. In 1875 he became a member of the Railway Committee, where he became chairman in 1880.

The Murphy Institute was first established in 1984 at Queens College in collaboration with three New York City labor unions for the purposes of providing worker education to labor union members. In 2005, the Murphy Institute was incorporated into the CUNY School of Professional Studies, expanding to provide undergraduate and graduate degrees. Though New York labor unions had been petitioning for the Murphy Institute to become its own stand-alone school since 2012, when the New York State AFL-CIO passed a resolution endorsing the proposal, it was only until Governor Andrew Cuomo added $1.5 million to the state budget in 2018 that funding was available.

Hirata was a 13-year-old child prodigy when he won the gold medal in 1996 at the International Physics Olympiad. He studied physics at Caltech from the age of 14 to 18, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2001. He did research at the age of 16 for NASA on the colonization of Mars and received his PhD under the supervision of Uro≈° Seljak in 2005 from Princeton University in Astrophysics (thesis: \\"Weak Gravitational Lensing Theory and Data Analysis\\"). From 2005 to 2007 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. From 2006 to 2012 he was assistant professor and then full professor at Caltech before moving to the Ohio State University the following academic year in the same capacity. He is currently a professor at OSU's Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP). Research Hirata's research emphasis is Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), dark energy and accelerating expansion of the universe, galaxy clusters and the large- scale structure of the universe (and the formation of these structures, the Reionization epoch), and gravitational lenses as a tool of cosmology. Hirata works both in theory and in the analysis of observational data as well as in the design of telescopes (specifically NASA's next generation of space telescopes). His overarching focus is on cosmology and on dark energy. Hirata is considered a leading exponent of precision cosmology, combining interdisciplinary computer studies, theoretical studies, and observational astronomy including instrument development. In 2010, with Dmitriy Tseliakhovich, he pointed to an unprecedented effect in cosmological perturbation theory for the calculation of the formation of the first structures in the universe. It is based on the fact that the speed of sound in baryonic matter (as opposed to dark matter) decreased drastically (from relativistic to thermal velocities) when the first atoms formed (recombination epoch), which leads to supersonic velocity currents of baryonic matter (which under gravitational influence of faster dark matter moves) and quadratic perturbation terms. According to Hirata and Tseliakhovich, this leads to a suppression of the formation of the first structures with observable effects. With others, he initiated a program for analyzing information from astronomical data for possible inferences on fundamental questions of particle physics and what it might suggest for creating new observation programs. A central question is whether the acceleration of the universe indicates dark energy (retention of general relativity but with an additional dynamic scalar field) or a modification of the general theory of relativity. He is a member of NASA's proposed Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) space telescope.

It was established in the 1960s as \\"Book Circus\\". As notable Los Angeles gay cruising spots of the late 20th Century, both locations are now considered important sites of Los Angeles' gay history.  History  The store opened at 8230 Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood as Book Circus. In 1982, when the owner was having financial problems, it was taken over by Barry Mason, a former special effects engineer and inventor, and his wife Karen, a former journalist, who had been working as distributors for Larry Flynt's publications. They renamed it Circus of Books and opened the Silver Lake branch. In addition to gay porn and adult toys, the store stocked back-list paperbacks, novels by LGBTQ writers, science fiction books, Bibles, and foreign newspapers. In the 1980s, after the election of Ronald Reagan as president and especially after the publication of the Meese Report, law enforcement cracked down on pornography. Circus of Books was caught in an FBI sting and Barry Mason was prosecuted; his lawyer mounted a First Amendment defence and he was let off after a guilty plea by the corporation.Netflix documentary \\"Circus of Books\\", 57:47. In 1989 the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department ordered that the West Hollywood store close from 2 AM to 6 AM after complaints that it attracted hustlers. A third branch in Sherman Oaks was forced to close in the 1990s because it was too close to an elementary school. Business declined in the 21st century. The Silverlake branch closed on August 8, 2016. (A marijuana dispensary occupies the former space, although the original sign remains.) The West Hollywood location closed on February 9, 2019. The owners' daughter Rachel Mason, an artist, musician, and filmmaker, stated the easy accessibility of gay pornography and cruising apps like Grindr replaced the need for a spot like Circus of Books.

Baxley worked with infamous spy Rose Greenhow were imprisoned in December 30, 1861 and deported back to the confederate states in 1862. Later, Baxley continued being a blockade runner for the Confederacy during the civil war. She was arrested again while getting off a boat from Baltimore, Maryland and became a union prisoner. She was one of the first women confined in the Old Capital Prison, Washington, D.C. from February 24-July 2, 1865 where she was transferred after originally being held at Fort Greenhow. Like John Surratt, Baxley was a courier and carried letters across the union blockade. Baxley's son, a 17-year-old Confederate soldier, was also imprisoned at Old Capital Prison. The teenager had joined the Confederacy at 16. He arrived at the prison wounded after Baxley had already been captured for quite some time. His wounds were reportedly minor, but he was taken to the hospital infirmary. He eventually developed typhoid fever and died due to the conditions of the prison. Baxley reportedly attempted to get the guards to give better food to the boy, as a result she was removed from his side and the boy died soon after in Mary Surratt's arms.  The letters  According to the United States War Department, Baxley was caught carrying letters to General Winder, Mr. Benjamin, Dr. Septimus Brown, Jefferson Davies, President of the Confederate States among other Confederate leaders. She had numerous letters concealed among her person. Baxley was coming from Richmond, VA.  Baxley's personal writings  She wrote letters to exaggerate gender stereotypes to try to get herself released. Reportedly one week after her initial imprisonment she wrote a letter to Secretary of State Steward claiming she was a silly, innocent woman incapable of espionage. She wrote, \\"I carried with me nothing in the world but a few friendly letters...Liberate me, for god's sake...I shall die here.\\" Baxley thus represented herself to the union as a well-intentioned, politically naive woman. Baxley also kept a journal during her time in prison. This journal seemed to serve the purpose of expressing her thoughts, turmoils, and emotions after being captured and watching the death of her son. The diary expresses a forceful discontent with the North.  Notable writings on Baxley  = Rose Greenhow = Greenhow frequently discussed her disdain for Baxley. Greenhow believed Baxley had overstepped acceptable codes of female conduct, namely that she had unladylike manners. Greenhow also kept a journal and documented various moments of tension between the two women. In one excerpt, Greenhow described guards who wanted to lead the three women, Greenhow, Baxley and Ms. Morris through a dirty back stairway. In disagreement, Greenhow attempted to explain that she would like to go in their usual route. Baxley and Morris then attempted to go down the usual route despite the guards' orders, and attempted to push their way past the guards. To Greenhow's horror, Baxley grabbed the guards' muskets and attempted to duck under it. The guard cursed at Baxley and she then punched the guard in the face, giving him a nosebleed. The guard then pushed Baxley and kicked her. Greenhow even wrote she was humiliated to be associated with Baxley, citing this occurrence. Some theorists, however, think that Greenhow knew that Union members would read her writings and Greenhow thus deliberately downplayed their work together. = Virginia Lomax = Virginia Lomax wrote that Baxley, \\"Said and did whatever she pleased.\\" According to Lomax, Baxley was witty and she constantly vexed the guards with her sarcasm. = Morris = Mary Morris reportedly voiced fears that Baxley could be a counterspy for the North. Thus adding to the perspective that Morris, Greenhow, and Baxley‚Äîwhile all in support of the confederacy, disliked each other considerably. = John L. Brown = Brown wrote that Baxley had bragged to him about transporting 200 guns to the Southern Army.

It is a listed UN World Heritage site. Finds from the site are displayed at Al Ain National Museum. The dating of pottery from the falaj irrigation systems found at the site demonstrates a south-eastern Arabian origin for this distinctive system of irrigation, previously thought by many scholars to have been Persian in origin. The dating of aflaj in Bidaa bint Saud, Al Ain and Buraimi, both of which are in the historical region of Tawam, has been placed several centuries prior to the Achaemenid Empire, which had previously been credited with the innovation. The site, located some north of Al Ain, is thought to have been a stopping place on a long-established caravan route from settlements at Al Ain to the Northern Emirates. The rocky outcrop of Garn bin Saud looms some above the site and is dotted with burial remains.  Bronze Age tombs  A alt= A number of distinctive Hafit Period (3200 to 2600 BCE) tombs litter the eastern face of Garn bint Saud, similar to those found at sites such as Jebel Hafit, Jebel Al-Buhais and Al-Buraimi. These have collapsed and would originally have had domed roofs. It is likely the location of the Hafit remains, the Hafit people being nomadic and pastoral, is because of a source of groundwater, a pattern supported by other Hafit era inland finds, including those at Jebel Hafit and Jebel Al-Buhais.  Iron Age waterways  A pot, discovered in the left A second set of collective graves found at the site dated from the Iron Age and were also built of uncut or rough-cut stone and formed into a variety of shapes. These were divided into several chambers, each of which contained the remains of several people. Despite having been plundered in the past, excavations from these Iron Age tombs yielded a number of artefacts, including pottery and stone vessels, dagger blades, bronze arrowheads, and beads. It is thought Bidaa Bint Saud became an important site during the Iron Age, both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used the falaj irrigation system. Two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at Bidaa bin Saud, with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition. In one of the excavations, a number of sandstone-lined shaft holes were discovered, as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern. Evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at the site. The mother well is thought to have been relatively shallow, about away from the head of the falaj systems. Located some from the main access point of the falaj, archaeologists have also excavated a large mud-brick building containing a hall of . Parts of the remains stand up to high and, while the roof is missing, there is evidence it was supported by 12 columns. Storage rooms were a later addition and contained finds of many storage jars. While the building's precise purpose remains unclear, archaeologists think it was likely a distribution point for the water from the falaj systems and it has been dubbed Bait Al-Falaj ().

All that remains are two escutcheons; a third disintegrated soon after excavation, and no longer survives. The escutcheons were found in 1848, alongside the better-known Benty Grange helmet, by the antiquary Thomas Bateman in a tumulus at the Benty Grange farm in Derbyshire. They were undoubtedly buried as part of an entire hanging bowl, placed in what appears to have been the burial mound of a high-status warrior. What remains of one escutcheon belongs to Museums Sheffield and in 2018 was displayed at Weston Park Museum. The other is held by the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford; as of 2020 it is not on display.  Description  Durham Gospel Fragment contains similar fish-like creatures. The two surviving escutcheons are made of enamelled bronze and are in diameter. They have the same design and plain frames, parts of which survive. Both escutcheons are fragmentary; enough survives of each for the design to be reconstructed, and, because of overlapping segments, for it to be certain that they represent two distinct pieces. Whether they are hook escutcheons, associated with the suspension hooks on the exterior of the bowl, or basal discs, placed at the base of the interior, is uncertain, but a ring on the back of one fragment suggests an association with the suspension chains, and a contemporary watercolour by Llewellynn Jewitt seems to show that a hook may have been present at excavation. The decomposed enamel background appears yellow to the eye, as it did when excavated. A yellow-creatures-on-red-background colour scheme has also been suggested, but on minimal and possibly incorrect evidence. As sampling of the enamel was not permitted when the Sheffield escutcheon was analysed at the museum in 1968, however, the all-yellow hypothesis is not definitive. The reconstructed design shows three \\"ribbon-style fish or dolphin-like creatures\\", each biting the tail of the animal ahead of it. The bodies are yellow like the background, and defined by their outlines. They are limbless, the tails curled in a circle, and the jaws both long and curved; where the tails should pass through the jaws of the animals behind, gaps appear, creating slight separations between segments of tail. Each animal has a small eye shaped like a pointed oval. The outer borders of the discs, the plain frames, and the contours and eyes of the animals, are all tinned or silvered. Surviving records of the third escutcheon indicate that it was of a different style and size. Drawings by Bateman and Jewitt show it with a scroll pattern and small piece of frame. It appears to have been about half the size of the other two, and may have originally been placed at the bottom of the hanging bowl. The escutcheons were undoubtedly part of an entire hanging bowl when buried. Nothing else survives. The mass of corroded chainwork discovered six feet away, which survives only in illustrations by Jewitt and descriptions by Bateman, is unlikely to be related; although a large and intricate chain was found with a cauldron from Sutton Hoo, the Benty Grange chains appear dissimilar. The Benty Grange chainwork was also likely too heavy to have been used to suspend the hanging bowl.  Parallels  Similar dolphin-like creatures from the Book of Durrow The animal designs on the Benty Grange hanging bowl are paralleled by designs on other escutcheons, and even more closely by designs on medieval illuminated manuscripts. Three escutcheons from a hanging bowl found in Faversham show animals that also look like dolphins, but with more developed bodies; a better parallel is with a disc found near the Lullingstone hanging bowl that is also decorated with dolphin-like creatures. Despite the similarities with other escutcheon and disc designs, several manuscript illustrations are more closely related to the Benty Grange designs. Bateman remarked on this as early as 1861, \\"shrewdly\\" as it turned out, noting that similar patterns were used in \\"several manuscripts of the VIIth Century, for the purpose of decorating the initial letters\\". Anglo-Saxon metalwork designs like those on the Benty Grange escutcheons may have inspired aspects of the manuscript art. In particular, the mid-seventh-century Durham Gospel Fragment contains two similar fish-like motifs contained within the lateral stroke of the INI monogram that introduces the Gospel of Mark. The Book of Durrow also contains a similar illustration of linked yellow dolphin- like creatures.  Discovery  = Location = Benty Grange Farm, in the parish of Monyash in the Derbyshire Dales district The hanging bowl was discovered in a barrow on the Benty Grange farm in Derbyshire, in what is now the Peak District National Park. Thomas Bateman, an archaeologist and antiquarian who led the excavation, described Benty Grange as \\"a high and bleak situation\\"; its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road, now the A515, possibly to display the burial to passing travellers. It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments, Arbor Low stone circle and Gib Hill barrow. The seventh- century Peak District was a small buffer state between Mercia and Northumbria, occupied, according to the Tribal Hidage, by the Anglo-Saxon Pecs√¶te. The area came under the fold of the Mercian kingdom around the eighth century; the Benty Grange and other rich barrows suggest that the Pecs√¶te may have had their own dynasty beforehand, but there is no written evidence for this. = Excavation = A contemporary watercolour by Llewellynn Jewitt depicts the surviving escutcheons, top, fragments of the third escutcheon, second-to- bottom row, and associated finds. Bateman excavated the barrow on 3 May 1848. Although he did not mention it in his account, he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave. The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by , and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted. Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials, only one of which was discovered by Bateman. The barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately in diameter and high, an encircling fosse about wide and deep, and outer penannular earthworks around wide and high. The entire structure measures approximately . Bateman suggested a body once lay at its centre, flat against the original surface of the soil, of which little remained; what he described as the one remnant, strands of hair, is now thought to be from a cloak of fur, cowhide or something similar. The recovered objects were found in two clusters. One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair, the other about to the west. In the latter area Bateman described \\"a large mass of oxydized iron\\" which, when removed and washed, presented itself as a jumbled collection of chainwork, a six-pronged piece of iron resembling a hayfork, and the Benty Grange helmet. In the area of the supposed hair, Bateman described \\"a curious assemblage of ornaments\\", which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth. This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood, approximately in diameter at the mouth. Its rim was edged with silver, while its surface was \\"decorated by four wheel-shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver, affixed by pins of the same metal, clenched inside\\". Also found were \\"a knot of very fine wire\\", some \\"thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges &c.;\\" attached to silk, but that soon decayed when exposed to air, and the Benty Grange hanging bowl. As Bateman described it Bateman closed his 1848 account of the excavation by noting the \\"particularly corrosive nature of the soil\\", which by 1861 he said \\"has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire\\". He suggested that this was the result of \\"a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid; the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth, and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains.\\" Bateman's friend Llewellynn Jewitt, an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations, painted four watercolours of the finds, parts of which were included in Bateman's 1848 account. This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations, a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow. The hanging bowl entered the extensive collection of Bateman. On 27 October 1848 he related his discoveries, including the helmet, cup, and hanging bowl, to the British Arch√¶ological Association, and in 1855 they were catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow. In 1861 Bateman died at 39, and in 1876 his son, Thomas W. Bateman, loaned the collection to Sheffield. It was displayed at the Weston Park Museum through 1893, at which point the younger Bateman, having seen to his father's fortune, was forced to sell by order of chancery. The city purchased many of the objects that had been excavated in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, including the helmet, the cup fittings, and one of the hanging bowl escutcheons; other pieces were dispersed by Sotheby's, and later in 1893 the second escutcheon was presented to the Ashmolean Museum by Sir John Evans. As of 2020, the escutcheons remain in the collections of the two museums. The Benty Grange barrow was designated a scheduled monument on 23 October 1970. The list entry notes that \\"[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains.\\" It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information. The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014; as of 2018 it is rented out as a holiday cottage. = Publication = Bateman published an article on the Benty Grange excavation in October 1848‚Äîfive months after excavating the barrow‚Äîin The Journal of the British Archaeological Association. The finds were included in his 1855 catalogue of his collection, and shortly before his death, Bateman revised and expanded upon his 1848 account in his 1861 book Ten Years' Digging in Celtic and Saxon Grave Hills. Similarly, Llewellynn Jewitt commented upon the finds, including the hanging bowl, in his 1870 book Grave-mounds and their Contents. The hanging bowl was one of the first to be discovered, and in 1898 John Romilly Allen included it among 16 examples in the first English article to discuss hanging bowls as a distinct class of artefact. It was frequently mentioned in the literature thereafter, including reconstructions by T. D. Kendrick in 1932 and 1938, Fran√ßoise Henry in 1936, Audrey Ozanne in 1962‚Äì1963, and George Speake in 1980. Rupert Bruce-Mitford revisited the Benty Grange burial in 1974, and published what he termed a \\"definitive\\" reconstruction of the escutcheons in 1987; in his posthumous 2005 work A Corpus of Late Celtic Hanging-Bowls he added a full description of the hanging bowl, and a reconstruction in colour of the escutcheons.

He mistakes a visiting student, played by Tony Labrusca as an activist resisting Marcos' Martial Law administration, and captures and torture the student, just as he did to activists back in the 1970s. The film was released on August 3, 2018 at the 14th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival. Along with Kip Oebanda's Liway, it is one of two Cinemalaya 2018 films featuring social commentary about the martial law, continuing the tradition of 2017's Respeto in light of the 2016 Burial of Ferdinand Marcos and the rise of his children Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Imee Marcos in Philippine politics.  Plot  Carlo (Tony Labrusca), a pro martial law millennial student, interviews retired Colonel Dela Cruz (Eddie Garcia) about his experience and service under the Marcos regime during the martial law days. Unbeknownst to Carlo, the Colonel is actually delusional and psychopathic in nature. Just as when the interview was starting at the Colonel's home, he strikes Carlo in the head causing him to be unconscious. When Carlo woke up, he finds himself strapped on a chair in the basement. Confused of what was happening, he demanded to be cut loose by the Colonel but is only answered with physical battery. He is later tortured in numerous ways by the delusional Colonel while asking him questions that he has entirely no clue what's about. His best friend Jace and girlfriend Pat are later lured into the same basement through deceiving text messages. All three of them were tortured in front of each other. Both Carlo and Jace were beaten-up and electrocuted. Jace was water-boarded and later murdered by Russian-roulette. Pat was tied up and was burned with cigarettes on her private parts and was also sexually violated with a bottle. Jace's corpse was later thrown on a pavement with a sign that says ‚ÄúHuwag tularan, pusher‚Äù to make him look like a casualty in Duterte's drug war. Only Carlo and Pat were able to escape.

It was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and built in 1920 by day labour. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The original Illawarra Railway of the 1880s had a difficult transition from the high country near the top of the Illawarra escarpment down to the coastal plain north of Wollongong. It involved steep grades and eight tunnels between Waterfall and Scarborough. The worst was the \\"suffocating\\" Otford railway tunnel, the steepest and longest, which emerged into the lower levels of the Stanwell Park amphitheatre. Plans began around 1910 for duplicating the line with deviations to ease grades and to bypass the old single line tunnels. The section from Waterfall to Helensburgh was completed in 1914, then to Otford in 1915 and on to Coalcliff in 1920. The last section stayed much higher up in the Stanwell Park amphitheatre hence its crossing high above Stanwell Creek. Plans for the tall, double track, brick arch viaduct were ready in 1917 and work began the next year. It was a remarkable effort to complete this major structure in a little over two years. Brick arches were the automatic choice because steel was unavailable due to World War I and the State Brickworks at Homebush was in full production. It was still part of the \\"brick arch era\\" 1910-24. It has been estimated that the total number of bricks used in the massive tall piers, the tallest high, and the eight arches was around three million, enough to build about 150 brick houses. The viaduct remained in good condition until 1985 when the arches were found to be on the verge of collapse, at which time remedial work was undertaken.  Description  Located from Central station, the bridge consists of a curved brick arch viaduct consisting of eight clear spans on tall brick piers. It was reported to currently be in a stable condition as at 17 March 2006. Major modifications (mainly internal) and the loss of arch span 6, all necessary to save the structure from collapse, have compromised the integrity of the viaduct. However, if long term stability is confirmed, the Rail Authority may consider rebuilding arch span 6. = Modifications and dates = In late 1985, some of the brick arches were on the verge of collapse caused by ground movements associated with the Escarpment and coal mining. The problem was arrested but span 6 was demolished and replaced by a \\"floating\\" steel girder so the remaining two parts of the brick arch viaduct could be monitored and plans made for repairs. In 1992 repairs began under single line working. The closed track was taken up and all material on top of the arches removed then replaced by concrete with embedded layers of reinforcing mesh. Arch action was essentially eliminated. The track was replaced on a waterproof base and the process repeated for the other track. Work was completed in October 1993 but the steel girder in span 6 remains while long-term monitoring continues.  Heritage listing  This viaduct is one of the most impressive bridge structures in Australia. Its significance to New South Wales is due to it being a major item of infrastructure for the historically important duplication of the Illawarra Railway, its imposing stature high above the creek bed (albeit hidden by trees and bush, its contribution to the enormous social and commercial benefits that railway duplication brought to the Wollongong and Illawarra Regions and the technical skills of building it \\"up there\\" and to suit a sharp radius curve. It was the crowning achievement of the \\"brick arch era\\" 1910-24 of railway construction in New South Wales. It is the only one of its type and scale in Australia and retains its significance even though emergency work to save it, compromised its integrity. Stanwell Park Rail Viaduct over Stanwell Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Stanwell Creek railway viaduct was the major bridge of the duplication and deviations works on the Illawarra Line 1910-20 between Waterfall and Scarborough. At Stanwell Park, the work kept the new double track line high up in the natural amphitheatre which in turn required a high level crossing of Stanwell Creek. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The structure is one of the most impressive bridge structures in Australia, eight brick arches sweeping round a sharp railway curve atop brick piers that reach above the creek bed. Unfortunately, the view has been lost by the uncontrolled growth of trees and bushland. Only archival photographs give justice to this imposing work. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The duplication and deviation work on the Illawarra Railway brought enormous social and commercial benefits to the Illawarra Region, which were only achieved through major engineering works such as the Stanwell Creek Viaduct and the five new double-track tunnels. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Constructing the high level Stanwell Creek Viaduct involved two important technical items, building it above the creek bed and laying the bricks for the arches on a sharp railway curve. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This is only brick arch viaduct of its type and size in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The viaduct is an excellent example of brick arch construction with the added challenges of height and curvature.

It's located near the eastern edge of Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula. At high, Inner Constance is the fifth highest peak of the Olympic Mountains, after Mount Olympus, Mount Deception, Mount Constance, and Mount Johnson. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Constance at to the east. Within this nearly mile-wide separation resides a deep glacially carved canyon called Avalanche Canyon. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the peak drains into tributaries of the Dungeness River, whereas the south side drains into tributaries of the Dosewallips River. Climate Inner Constance is located in the eastern portion of the Olympic Mountains. This location results in less precipitation than Mount Olympus and the western Olympics receive. Inner Constance is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Inner Constance above the weather Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

He co-founded and serves as a senior faculty member at Yeshivat Birkat Moshe, the Hesder yeshiva of Maale Adumim. Biography Sheilat was born in Jerusalem in 1946. The majority of his studies took place at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav, where he studied under Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and Rabbi David Cohen, the \\"Rav HaNazir\\". He is a close disciple of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook. He attended the rabbi's public lectures and studied privately with him for several years, learning the Halakhic and philosophical writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. \\"His influence on me as an educator and teacher was tremendous. We learned from his lectures, from his conduct, from the stories he told. He had a decisive influence on the yeshiva students.\\" He studied Natural Sciences at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook's policy, however, was not to allow students to combine yeshiva studies with academic studies; so Sheilat transferred to Yeshivat HaKotel. After completing his degree, he returned to Mercaz HaRav. In 1977, he co-founded Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma'aleh Adumim, near Jerusalem, with Rabbi Haim Sabato. During the years that he taught at the yeshiva, he refused to be paid for teaching Torah, following Maimonides' teaching that accepting wages belittles the respect of Torah scholars. Instead, he took a salary as librarian, working in the library for several hours a day and serving the public. In 2016, when Rabbi Nahum Rabinovitch stepped down as rosh yeshiva and asked Sheilat to head the yeshiva, he left his librarian position and began receiving a salary as dean of the yeshiva. Sheilat is also a disciple of Rabbi Gedaliah Nadel, a prominent student of the Chazon Ish. After Nadel's death in 2004, Sheilat published a compilation of his teachings entitled Betorato shel Rav Gedalia. Sheilat wrote in the preface that everything in the book was approved by Nadel himself. The book, however, was banned by three of the most respected spiritual leaders in the Haredi world, as it seeks to resolve apparent contradictions between science and Torah, accepting Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and other scientific views over biblical literalism. In 2012 he was awarded the Rav Kook Prize from the Tel Aviv‚ÄìJaffa Municipality for his work on texts of Maimonides. His wife, Yehudit Sheilat, is director of Takana, a forum of prominent personalities fighting sexual abuse in the National Religious sector. They have 9 children. Views Sheilat publicized his opinion that it is important that Jews visit Har HaBayit (the Temple Mount) in purity. His opinion regarding religious soldiers ordered to evacuate settlements was that a soldier may not disobey orders. He believes that Maimonides' gravesite in Tiberias is authentic. \\"The Rambam asked to be buried in Tiberias because of his belief that the Sanhedrin would be re-established there.\\" In 2018, Shilat published a book promoting his legal solution to the problems of Agunah and Get refusal by way of a new regulation (takanah). He argues that the Rabbinical High Court in Israel is for all intents and purposes a \\"state court\\", since all marriages and divorces are subject to the authority of the Chief Rabbinate. Imposing a Get (divorce document) by force of the regulation will be completely kosher, and it will be considered a duly enacted divorce. Published works Sheilat authored definitive editions of the following writings of Maimonides: * Iggrot ha- Rambam * Hakdamot ha-Rambam * Avot im Perush ha-Rambam In 2009, he authored a new translation of Rabbi Judah Halevi's classic philosophical work, entitled: Sefer Ha-Kuzari: Precise Hebrew Translation in the Style of the Period of Its Composition. He wrote Bein ha-Kuzari le-Rambam in 2010, comparing the philosophical approaches of Maimonides and Rabbi Judah Halevi. He published Zichron Teruah, Rosh Devarcha and Hararim Hateluyim, an analysis of practical halachic concepts in tractates Rosh Hashanah, Berakhot and Shabbat.

It is situated east of Breton Sound and south of Mississippi Sound. It was formed by the mixing of the Gulf of Mexico and the waters of the Mississippi River, protected by the Islands. Mississippi River Delta with the Chandeleur Sound north of it Climate and geography Similarly to the rest of Louisiana, the Sound experiences a semitropical climate. The average water temperatures range from 70Àö to 84Àö by month and the humidity ranges between 73% and 84%. Due to the humidity, clouds often form overhead, reducing the amount of daily sunlight that the area receives to as little as 4 hours. The Sound is a part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge and is situated near the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge. =Hurricane Katrina effects= The left image is from before Hurricane Katrina and the right is from after, showing the reduction of the islands and exposure of the Sound to the Gulf. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a category 3 hurricane and destroyed part of the Chandeleur Islands, exposing some of the Sound to the Gulf. Uses The Sound has served a major purpose for a long time, including fishing, as it is located just outside of the New Orleans metropolitan area. The metro has an estimated population of 1,275,762 as of 2017 and has been served by the Sound since the area was settled in 1718. =Transportation= The Sound is accessible to fishermen in both Mississippi and Louisiana, the two states that border it. Because the Chandeleur Islands protect the Sound from rough seas, ships of all sizes can roam it. Most boats that enter the Sound are used for fishing. =Fishing= Fish is a primary export from the region, including Redfish and Speckled trout. The abundance of fish in the sound has helped the region flourish and thrive by allowing humans to settle as early as 1718, when the French arrived in New Orleans. Other fish that can be found in the Sound include, but are not limited to, Flounder, Bluefish, Spanish mackerel, Cobia, Tarpon and Jack crevalle. The prime fishing season is during the Summer. The city of New Orleans itself was founded in 1718 and the Sound has served it for over 300 years. However, fishing was banned across the Gulf Coast for a period of time after the 2010 oil spill, causing the industry to temporarily die out. Oil Spill Fishery Closure Map =Further development= Nearby cities that have developed with help from the Sound include Gulfport, Mississippi, located about forty miles north and New Orleans, Louisiana, which is about sixty miles west. The Sound has helped both cities grow tremendously, due to the abundance of fish and the ability to travel the region with ease. Pollution Pollution has been a major issue for the region in recent years that has caused wildlife to die as a result of waste being carried in the Mississippi River and oil spills in the region. Oil Reaches Chandeleur Islands =2010 oil spill= In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, an oil‚Äìdrilling machine, sprung a leak in the Gulf of Mexico. A reported 4.9 million barrels of oil were spilled off the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and to a lesser extent, Texas. Louisiana's marshes were impacted heavily by the spill, which occurred just forty miles off the coast of the state. More than 450 miles of the Chandeleur Sound's coastline marshes were oiled and destroyed. The reduction of the marshes by cause of human activity accelerated rapidly after the spill. Oil slicks surround the Chandeleur Islands =Dead zones= In 2008, a dead zone was discovered by scientists in the Sound that grew extensively after the oil spill. The likely starting cause is waste nutrients being carried into the estuaries by the Mississippi River, although the oil made it worse. The dead zone appeared to be created by low amounts of oxygen in the region, known as hypoxic zones, as a result of phosphorus and nitrogen blocking out sunlight. It grows the most during the summer, when the flow of these nutrients is the highest.

The Pul-i-Darunteh Aramaic inscription, also called Aramaic inscription of Lampaka, is an inscription on a rock in the valley of Laghman (\\"Lampaka\\" being the transcription in Sanskrit of \\"Laghman\\"), Afghanistan, written in Aramaic by the Indian emperor Ashoka around 260 BCE. It was discovered in 1932 at a place called Pul-i-Darunteh. Since Aramaic was the official language of the Achaemenid Empire, which disappeared in 320 BCE with the conquests of Alexander the Great, it seems that this inscription was addressed directly to the populations of this ancient empire still present in northwestern India, or to border populations for whom Aramaic remained the language of use.A new Aramaic inscription of Asoka found in the Laghman Valley (Afghanistan), Andr√© Dupont-Sommer Proceedings of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1970 114-1 p.173 Background The discovery of this inscription in 1932 is one of a set of similar inscriptions in Aramaic or Greek (or both together), written by Asoka. In 1915, Sir John Marshall had discovered the Aramaic Inscription of Taxila. In 1958 the famous Bilingual Kandahar Inscription, written in Greek and Aramaic was discovered, and in 1963 the Greek Edicts of Ashoka, again in Kandahar]. In the same year 1963 and again in Kandahar, an inscription in \\"Indo-Aramaic\\" known as the Kandahar Aramaic inscription or Kandahar II was found, in which the Indian Prakrit language and the Aramaic language alternate, but using only the Aramaic script. The Aramaic parts translate the Indian parts transcribed in the Aramaic alphabet. In 1969, two Belgian anthropologists by chance discovered another Aramaic edict, Aramaic Inscription of Laghman or Lahman I. A few years later, in 1973, Lahmann II followed.History of Discoveries and identifications from M. Boyce / F. Grenet, A History of Zoroastrianism, Zoroastrianism under Macedonian and Roman Rule, 1991. Content of the inscription The inscription is incomplete. However, the place of discovery, the style of the writing, the vocabulary used, makes it possible to link the inscription to the other Ashoka inscriptions known in the region. In the light of other inscriptions, it has been found that the Pul-i-Darunteh inscription consists of a juxtaposition of Indian and Aramaic languages, all in Aramaic script, and the latter representing translations of the first.Essenism and Buddhism, Dupont-Sommer, Andr√©, Proceedings of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres Year 1980 124-4 pp.698-715 p.706 This inscription is generally interpreted as a translation of a passage of the Major Pillar Edicts n¬∞5 or n¬∞7,Handbuch der Orientalistik by Kurt A. Behrendt [https: //books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&pg;=PA39 p.39] although others have proposed to categorize it among the Minor Rock Edicts of Ashoka.Inscriptions of Asoka from DC Sircar p.33  See also  * List of Ashoka Edicts * Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription * Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India /Chapter 4 by Vincent Arthur Smith: The Rock Edicts (this version)  References  Category:Archaeological sites in Afghanistan Category:Aramaic inscriptions Category:Edicts of Ashoka ","title":"Pul-i-Darunteh Aramaic inscription"},{"id":"58035350","title":"Hunger stone"},{"id":"58035356","text":"Brendan Dunne (born 5 July 1955) is an Irish Olympic boxer.
