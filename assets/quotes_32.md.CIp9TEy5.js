She was one of the original presenters of Blue Peter, working on the programme from 1958 to 1962. Career In 1957 Williams won the Miss Great Britain title. The following year she became the first female Blue Peter presenter, co-presenting with Christopher Trace. Williams left Blue Peter at the start of 1962, after being made redundant by Clive Parkhurst, a newly appointed producer, with whom she did not get on. Williams recalled \\"he could not find anything for me to do\\", and in October, Williams did not appear for six editions, and was eventually fired, leaving Christopher Trace on his own or with one-off presenters. Parkhurst was replaced by John Furness. She went on to play small parts in the films Watch Your Stern, Marriage of Convenience and The Beauty Jungle, and returned to Blue Peter for the show's 20th anniversary in 1978 and subsequently the 40th anniversary in 1998 and the 60th in 2018. Personal life Williams married Fred Mudd, lead singer of the popular music group The Mudlarks, and in the early to mid-1960s had their only child Debra. Whilst the Mudlarks were touring in the early 1970s, she worked as an assistant manager at a Dorothy Perkins clothing store in Harrow. The couple then ran public houses in Kingston-upon-Thames and Surbiton for many years before retiring to Spain. Fred Mudd died there in 2007.

Their authorship is unknown, though Wilhelm von Giesebrecht suggested that Arno of Salzburg was the author of an early section of the Annales Laurissenses majores surviving in the copy at Lorsch Abbey. The Annals are believed to have been composed in successive sections by different authors, and then compiled.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 5 The depth of knowledge regarding court affairs suggests that the annals were written by persons close to the king, and their initial reluctance to comment on Frankish defeats betrays an official design for use as Carolingian propaganda.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 4 Though the information contained within is heavily influenced by authorial intent in favor of the Franks, the annals remain a crucial source on the political and military history of the reign of Charlemagne. Copies of the annals can be categorized into five classes, based on additions and revisions to the text.Kurze ‚ÄúPraefatio‚Äù Annales Regni Francorum p. viii The chronicles were continued and incorporated in the West Frankish Annales Bertiniani and in the East Frankish Annales Fuldenses and Annales Xantenses. Content P√©pin the Short by Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz. The annals give a brief individual description of events for each year (a few omitted), with a focus on the actions of the Carolingian monarchy, beginning with the account of Pepin the Short's ascension through the dethronement of the Merovingian king Childeric III. The annalists pay particular attention to the military campaigns of the Carolingian kings, justifying their actions in terms of a grand narrative of Carolingian peacekeeping and conquest in the name of expanding the Christian faith. The overthrow of the Merovingians is also portrayed in such a way as to legitimize the transfer of royal power between dynasties, emphasizing Carolingian adherence to Frankish traditions and the approval of Pope Zacharias in the matter.McKitterick ‚ÄúThe Illusion of Royal Power‚Äù English Historical Review p. 17 Of the three kings‚ÄîPepin, Charlemagne, and Louis‚ÄîCharlemagne's military chronicles are the most detailed, covering his victories against the Saxons, Bretons, and other peoples. The account of Charlemagne's campaign against the Saxons is also notable as one of the few extant references to the Irminsul, an important if enigmatic part of the Germanic paganism practiced by the Saxons at the time. Its destruction is a major point in the annals, written to continue a jingoistic theme of Frankish triumphs against the ‚Äúun-Frankish‚Äù and unchristian barbarian. The unrevised text neglects to mention defeats suffered by Charlemagne, such as the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778 (later dramatized in the Song of Roland) and the Battle of S√ºntel in 782.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 8 The Battle of S√ºntel is portrayed in the annals as a victory, as opposed to a crushing Frankish defeat at the hands of the Saxons. The 792 conspiracy of Pepin the Hunchback against Charlemagne is also omitted, along with any reference to potential misconduct on Charlemagne's part. The revised text, however, incorporates these events while maintaining a positive tone towards the emperor, presented as a peerless leader in battle. Attigny in 822. Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, is rarely shown engaging in battle by the annalists, but rather directs others to do so, or negotiates for peace. The contrast between Louis and his father and grandfather is clear. While the past kings were unshakeable figures, depicted as the better of their foes even in defeat by the revised edition, the annalists‚Äô Louis is a smaller man who invests the power of the military in others, not unlike the annals‚Äô earlier depiction of the Merovingian kings.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 8 Miracles aid Charlemagne and his men, and the grace of God leads him to victory; mostly ill portents surround Louis, such as an omen in the stars supposedly foretelling his army's defeat at the hands of Count Aizo, and the sudden collapse of a wooden arcade atop him in 817. Such references to striking natural phenomena, strange happenings, and miracles become increasingly common in the annal entries for the 9th century. In addition to astronomical oddities, such as eclipses, the supernatural begins to enter the account, set against almost ritualistic yearly notices of the regular passages of Christmas and Easter. Nearly two-dozen villages are reported to have been destroyed by heavenly fire in 823, while at the same time an unnamed girl is said to have begun a three-year fast. Scholz regards this preoccupation as a reflection of a belief in a divine will and control of history.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 9 Many of the worse omens also parallel growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately after the end of the annals spilled into civil war between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of Hilduin's translation of the relics of St. Sebastian to the Abbey of St. Medard, and Einhard's transport of the relics of SS. Marcellinus and Peter into Francia.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles pp. 16-17 A more detailed account of Einhard's procurement of the relics exists in his Translation and Miracles of Marcellinus and Peter. Additionally, the annals provide the only attestation to the existence of Charlemagne's personal elephant Abul-Abbas, aside from a mention by Einhard drawn from the annals. The gift of the elephant to Charlemagne, amongst other treasures, by Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid is evidence of the attempts to form an Abbasid- Carolingian alliance at the time, which the annals document loosely.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles pp. 16-17 Classification The annals survive in multiple versions, widely distributed across the Frankish empire, though none of these are original copies.McKitterick ‚ÄúThe Illusion of Royal Power‚Äù English Historical Review p. 8 Each version is marked with distinguishing features, and based on these features, Friedrich Kurze formulated five classes for the categorization of these texts.Kurze ‚ÄúPraefatio‚Äù Annales Regni Francorum p. viii This system still remains in use. The five classes of texts are lettered A through D, with an additional E class for the revised text. They are as follow: =Class A= Class A texts end at the year 788, and are reflected in one of the earliest modern printings of the annals, that of Heinrich Canisius's Francicorum Annalium fragmentum. Canisius also includes the years up to 793 in his printing, however, and Rosamond McKitterick speculates that the manuscript originally ran to that date.McKitterick Charlemagne p. 34 These manuscripts are now lost. =Class B= Class B texts go to, at the latest, 813. Kurze notes that one of these was used by Regino of Pr√ºm in his Chronicon.Kurze ‚ÄúPraefatio‚Äù Annales Regni Francorum p. ix =Class C= Class C texts are complete through 829. These contain various additions not found in the previous two classes, and Kurze divides them based on what other texts are found in their codices, such as the Liber historiae Francorum. =Class D= Class D texts are derived from a complete copy, though McKitterick points out that the derivatives are often not complete themselves.McKitterick Charlemagne p. 36 These also contain insertions not found in the other classes, including mention of Pepin the Hunchback. The revised texts are based on a Class D manuscript. =Class E= Class E comprises the revised editions of the annals, and are by far the most numerous. These are often found paired with Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni, and it is partially from this that they are sometimes believed to have been written by him as well, and thus called the Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi (English: Annals which are said to be of Einhard).Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 7 The revised editions correct the Latin of the originals and elaborate on many of the earlier entries, which were written by a terse hand in their unedited states. The major edits go up to 801, with minor stylistic changes through 812. Authorship \\"The destruction of Irminsul by Charlemagne\\" (1882) by Heinrich Leutemann. Though the number of sections into which the annals should be divided is debated, they undoubtedly were written in at least four stages, corresponding roughly to the entries for 741-795, 796-807, 808-819, and 820-829.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 5McKitterick Charlemagne p. 33 Additionally, an unknown editor produced the revised text at some point during the third stage. The identities of any of the authors save that of the fourth section are unknown, but production by a group of clerics associated with the Carolingian court is likely.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 6 =The First Section (741-795)= Between the years 741 and 768, the annals overlap with the continuations of the Chronicle of Fredegar. On account of this, scholars such as Scholz have suggested that the annals are based on the continuation of Fredegar up to 768, and then on minor annals up to some point between 787 and 793.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 5 McKitterick, however, contends that the continuation of Fredegar and the minor annals are more likely based upon the Annales regni Francorum, which is the most ordered and precise of them.McKitterick History and Memory p. 100 Neither argument considers these entries to be contemporaneous with the events described. The manner of reporting for these years is typically terse, though they include the convention of mentioning Easter and Christmas, which continues throughout the annals. The author of this section is unknown. Scholz posits the work of multiple authors in the royal chapel.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 6 The year 795 is not definitive as the date of authorial change, but it is the latest of those suggested. =The Second Section (796-807)= Unlike the first section, these entries were written contemporaneously and with greater depth. Considering this and the fact that the subject matter remains fixed on the actions of Charlemagne, composition by members of the royal chapel again seems likely, as few other groups would have had access to the same information. However, the identities of these authors remains unknown. =The Third Section (808-819)= This section, as well as the fourth, are also both contemporaneous accounts. Scholz notes an increased eloquence in the language employed from here on.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 6 At this time, the editor of the revised edition also began his work on the earlier entries, bringing the Latin up to a similar level as the new entries and adding lengthy passages where detail was lacking, again in the style of the later years. For this reason, the editor is believed to have belonged to or been affiliated with this third group of authors. =The Fourth Section (809-829)= This section ends abruptly after the events of 829, and for this reason has been associated with Hilduin of St. Denis.Monod ‚ÄúHilduin‚Äù Melanges p. 65 The case for his authorship is founded on Hilduin's involvement in the first civil war between Louis and his sons in 830.McKitterick Charlemagne p. 47 In that year, he left the emperor's service to join the sons‚Äô uprising and was subsequently banished, which would account for the termination of the annals. His increasing distaste for Louis would also correspond with the veiled negativity towards the emperor which surfaces in the later entries of the annal, in the form of faint praise and the recording of omens and disasters. Additionally, the entry for 826 mentions Hilduin's translation of relics, and is followed in 827 by Einhard's translation. The inclusion of these somewhat obscure events, both of which Hilduin was involved with, would be explained by his authorship of the section. =The Revised Text= An illustration of Einhard, to whom the revised text is often ascribed. The revised text is believed to have been edited after Charlemagne's death in 814 but prior to Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni, which references the revisions, written in 833 at the latest.McKitterick History and Memory p. 30 It covers the years 741 through 812, variously adding detail and modifying style.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 7 Leopold von Ranke put forth Einhard as the editor, an association which has carried with the revised annals in references to the Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 7 However, while no other names have been suggested for the editor, the case for Einhard cannot be argued definitively either.Scholz ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Carolingian Chronicles p. 7 Legacy Three major annals take up the work of the Annales regni Francorum after 829: the Annales Bertiniani, the Annales Fuldenses, and the Annales Xantenses. The Annales Bertiniani concern the West Frankish Kingdom from 830 to 882, serving as a direct unofficial continuation. The Annales Fuldenses use the Annales regni Francorum as a basis up to the year 829, and then continue on their own until 901, documenting the East Frankish Kingdom. The Annales Xantenses run from 832 to 873 and are largely independent from the other two continuations.

It was dedicated to King Victor Emanuel II. It is the biggest in Italy, and one of the largest of Europe (at the time of its inauguration, it was - with its area of 7730 sqm. - the third largest opera house in Europe after the Palais Garnier in Paris, and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna),http://www.teatromassimo.it/il- teatro/storia.html renowned for its perfect acoustics. Construction and opening An international competition for the creation of the opera house was announced by the Palermo Council in 1864 at the instigation of the mayor, Antonio Starrabba di Rudin√¨. For many years there had been talk of building a large new theatre in Palermo, worthy of the second biggest city in southern Italy (after Naples) and designed to promote the image of the city following the unification of Italy in 1861. Bust of Giuseppe Verdi outside of the Teatro Massimo The opera house was designed, and overseen by the Italian architect Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, who was well known in Sicily for his previous cathedral restoration design in the city of Acireale, as well as garden and villa designs in the city of Palermo and Caltagirone. Following G. B. F. Basile's death in 1891, construction was then overseen by his son, Architect Ernesto Basile. The Rutelli and Mach√¨ Company, represented by Giovanni Rutelli and Alberto Mach√¨ (both founding members of the company) was contracted for the main construction of the theatre which, under Architect Giovanni Rutelli's technical and building direction, went from the foundations all the way up to the theatre's attic structures. He was also responsible for all the external decorations of the building. Rutelli initially designed a steam tower crane machine which was then successfully able to lift large stone blocks and Greek/Roman styled columns during construction of the very large theatre. Giovanni Rutelli belongs to a very old and renowned Italian family of confirmed British Isles origin, a family which also includes architects and sculptor artists from the old Sicilian classic and baroque school as well as building contractors, all entrepreneurs going back to the first half of the 18th century in Palermo. Along with Architect D. Mario Rutelli (Giovanni's great-grandfather), they were considered to be among the most technically and artistically specialized experts in Sicily at that time, especially because of Mario Rutelli and his descendants' profound knowledge and experience in Ancient Greek/Roman architecture, as well as the Norman architectural style. This style required the use of natural thick stone, all of which was part of the structural design. The two very large bronze statues of lions sitting next to the theatre's monumental stairway entrance were created by Giovanni Rutelli's son, sculptor artist Sir Mario Rutelli and Benedetto Civiletti. Construction started on 12 January 1874, but was stopped for eight years from 1882 until 1890. Finally, on 16 May 1897, twenty-two years after the laying of the foundation stone, the fourth largest opera house in Europe at the time ‚Äî after the Royal Opera House in London, the Palais Garnier in Paris, and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna‚Äî was inaugurated with a performance of Verdi's Falstaff conducted by Leopoldo Mugnone. The interior is decorated and painted by Rocco Lentini, Ettore De Maria Bergler, Michele Cortegiani and Luigi Di Giovanni. Busts of famous composers were carved for the theatre by the Italian sculptor, Giusto Liva (born in Montebelluna, Treviso in 1847) and several of his sons. Facilities and recent history Interior view of the Teatro Massimo The Teatro Massimo is the largest theatre in Italy. Basile was inspired by ancient and classical Sicilian architecture and, thus, the exterior was designed in the high neoclassical style incorporating elements of the Greek temples at Selinunte and Agrigento. Realized in the late-Renaissance style, the auditorium was planned for 3,000 people, but, in its current format, it seats 1,381, with 7 tiers of boxes rising up around an inclined stage, and shaped in the typical horseshoe style. In 1974, the house was closed to complete renovations required by updated safety regulations, but cost over-runs, corruption, and political in-fighting all added to the delay and it remained closed for twenty-three years, finally re-opening on 12 May 1997, four days before its centenary. The opera season started again in 1999, although Verdi's Aida was performed in 1998 while work in progress continued. During the restoration regular opera seasons were performed in Teatro Politeama, a minor building not far from Teatro Massimo. In summer a few performances, usually concerts, ballet and operetta, are held in Teatro della Verdura. In recent years, \\"charges of corruption and political meddling‚Ä¶along with budget deficits and heavy debts\\" have plagued the house, but, under its then part-English music director, Jan Latham Koenig, it was reported that it is once again on track.Thicknesse, Robert, ‚ÄúDouble espresso‚Äù, Opera Now, July/August 2005. (An article on the Music Director, Jan Latham Koenig) 2013-2014 was a two-year hiatus under the leadership of the comissario straordinario Fabio Carapezza Guttuso, who brought in Lorenzo Amato and Eytan Pessen as artistic advisors. Under Carapezza Guttuso's leadership the theatre offered a varied programme including Richard Strauss's Feuersnot, Hans Werner Henze's Gisela!, Jaromir Weinberger's Schwanda the bagpiper and an increased ballet activity. The current intendant is the experienced Francesco Giambrone and the musical director is Gabriele Ferro. The final scenes of the Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather Part III (1990) were filmed at the theatre.

He was a longstanding member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly, although his career was interrupted by other posts and by illness. In particular he had poor eyesight, and wore very thick glasses, and later suffered deafness whilst in office. As an ally of Sir Roy Welensky, he was Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia from 1958 to 1962. His government was defeated in the 1962 general election by the Rhodesian Front.  Early life  Whitehead was born in the British Embassy in Berlin, where his father Sir James Beethom Whitehead was a diplomat. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and University College, Oxford, and moved to the colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1928 for health reasons. After working briefly for the civil service at Gwelo, he moved to a farm in the Bvumba Mountains near Umtali. Whitehead became active in the local farming unions. Participation in the Second World War He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly in 1939, but his service was interrupted by the Second World War. During the Second World War, he was in West Africa and was an Air Despatcher with the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. He served as Acting High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia in London from 1945 to 1946, before returning to Salisbury as Minister of Finance and Posts & Telegraphs from September 1946 to March 1947. During the Federation period, Whitehead served as Minister for Rhodesia & Nyasaland Affairs in Washington, D.C. from 1957 to 1958. Following a cabinet revolt which brought about the resignation of the liberal Garfield Todd in 1958, Whitehead was chosen as the compromise candidate for his United Federal Party's leadership. Recalled from Washington, a by-election was held to elect him to parliament, which the opposition Dominion Party won. Whitehead then called general elections and entered parliament as member for the Salisbury North constituency, becoming Prime Minister and Minister for Native Affairs. Liberal Rule His near five years in office saw continued rapid economic growth but also the beginnings of the dismantling of the Central African Federation against the wishes of his party. He was crucial in the negotiation of the 1961 constitution, which increased black representation in the Southern Rhodesian parliament. There was a relaxation of racial discrimination laws and a drive to enroll black voters during his period of office, but this was done against a background of civil unrest and a tightening of security measures. The policies of Whitehead's government caused alarm among the white population, while the blacks remained dissatisfied with the advances they had made. The conservative Rhodesian Front, led by Winston Field, defeated the UFP in the 1962 elections, riding upon opposition to the new constitution and Whitehead's relatively liberal views on race, winning 35 of 50 white seats. Of the 15 seats for blacks, the UFP won 14. Whitehead remained as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament until 1964. He lost his seat in the 1965 election when the Rhodesian Front took all the white seats in Parliament. The Rhodesian Front, from 1964 under the leadership of Ian Smith, would rule Rhodesia ('southern' was dropped from the name with the independence of Northern Rhodesia as Zambia) until 1979. Alec Douglas-Home in his memoir 'The Way the Wind Blows' noted his view of Whitehead as being very deaf, very blind and able to consume 13 beers in an evening without leaving the room. He was a bachelor and was seen by former Federation Minister Julian Greenfield in his memoirs (page 234) as having even less charisma than Edward Heath with voters, whether male or female. Retirement Appointed an OBE in 1944 and knighted in 1954, Whitehead retired back to the United Kingdom to live with his sister near Whitchurch in Hampshire. From there he called for a union between the UK and Rhodesia as a way forward from UDI. He died of cancer of the oesophagus and lung in a nursing home in Hamstead Marshall near Newbury in September 1971.GRO Certificate QBDX921543 A plaque to him in Salisbury (now Harare) Cathedral Cloisters was unveiled by former Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs in 1972.

The neighbouring municipalities in the Elz valley are Freiamt, Gutach im Breisgau and Simonswald, in the south-eastern branch of the Simonsw√§lder valley. The district is bordered by Sankt Peter, Glottertal, Denzlingen and Sexau. Waldkirch is located directly at the foot of the Kandel mountain, which is 1241 m high. The lowest point of Waldkirch is 243 m high, the difference in altitude in the district is 998 m. Due to its location in the Upper Rhine Plain occasionally there are some small earthquakes. The last major earthquake with a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale occurred on December 5, 2004, with the epicenter below the Kandel massif. =Subdivision on the town= The districts Buchholz, Kollnau, Siensbach including the road towards it (\\"Siensbacher Weg\\"), Suggental and Waldkirch belong to the town of Waldkirch. The boundaries of the districts are the same as those of the former independent municipalities. With the exception of the Waldkirch district, the official name of the districts is given by prefixing the name of the city and connecting it to the name of the respective district by a hyphen. The districts Buchholz, Kollnau, Siensbach as well as Suggental are localities (\\"Ortschaften\\") according to the Baden-W√ºrttemberg municipal regulations. The local councillor (\\"Ortschaftsrat\\") and the local head of town n(\\"Ortsvorsteher\\") are directly elected by the eligible voters in local elections. In the villages there are administrative offices called \\"Stadt Waldkirch - Ortsverwaltung\\". The Buchholz district includes the village of Buchholz and the hamlet of Batzenh√§usle. The Kollnau district includes the village of the same name and the farms Harnischwald, Kohlenbach and √úbental. The Siensbach district, including the Siensbacher Weg, includes the hamlets of Obertal (Dobel), Untertal and Zinken, the Biehl and M√ºhletal farms as well as the residential areas Beim Rechen and Eichb√ºhl. The Waldkirch district includes the town of the same name, the hamlet of Heimeck, the farms of Dettenbach, Eschbach, Petersh√∂fe and Wegelbach as well as the residential areas of Altersbach, Forstsiedlung and Kandelrasthaus. The Waldkirch district also includes the hamlet of Stahlhof, which until 1936 was an independent district together with the districts of Dettenbach, Heimeck, Petersh√∂fe and Wegelbach, the castles of Kastelburg and Schwarzenburg as well as the abandoned ruines of the castles of K√ºchlinsburg (of the K√ºchlin family) and Kyffelburg and the abandoned town of Weiler.  History  The earliest known mention of Waldkirch is the foundation of the Saint Margaret convent, by the Swabian duke Buchard II around the year 918. The settlement was later under the rule of the Schwarzenbergs, who built the Kastelburg and the Schwarzenburg alongside the settlement in the 13th Century, also adding a city wall. Schwarzenberg governors gave city law to Waldkirch on the 8th of August 1300. The von Rechbergs inherited the territory in 1457, followed by Sebastian von Ehingen in 1546 and Hans Raphael of Reischach in 1560. In 1567 Archduke Ferdinand of Austria gained rule over Schwarzenberg with the city of Waldkirch and from 1805 onwards, Waldkirch was the official city of Further Austria. The city then fell to the Grand Duchy of Baden, and was the official city of the district of Baden until 1936. Since then it has belonged to the district of Emmendingen. After WW2, which the city survived largely undamaged, Waldkirch belonged to the federal state of (South) Baden and was made part of the newly built federal state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1952. The present day city was reformed as part of the municipal reform on 1 January 1975. The reform was achieved through unification of the city of Waldkirch and the towns Buchholz and Kollnau. The city was renamed Waldkirch-Kollnau on the day of reform. On 1 July 1971 and 1 January 1973 respectively, Suggental and Siensbach were incorporated into Waldkirch. On 1 January 2009 Waldkirch was given the status of district capital. = Coat of arms =  Description  The arms of Waldkirch is in the canting arms style. The field of light blue has centered between supporters of lime (left) and oak (right) branches a silver church with a red roof and golden cross topping six hills in dark blue. The church refers to the name of the city. The six hills are based on the coat of arms of the Barrens of Swarzenberg. The arms is based on the oldest known seal from the 13th Century and was given to the city on 5 May 1976.  Old coat of arms  Between 1634 and 1976 the city used a coat of arms without the six hills. This arms had a blue and green background above and below the depicted double towered church, the right and left lined with two silver trees. Shown at the bottom of the coat of arms were three more silver trees.

The tradition of gemstone cutting, which reaches back to the Middle Ages, is still upheld today by the Wintermantel company. Organ building in Waldkirch, first established by Matthias Martin in 1799, grew to include barrel organs and orchestrions in the 19th century, gaining worldwide renown well into the 1920s. The organ builders J√§ger and Brommer, Paul Fleck S√∂hne, Achim Schneider and Wolfram St√ºtzle continue the tradition to this day. During the industrial revolution, Waldkirch - along with the entire Valley of the Elz - was an important location of the textile industry. Of this tradition, all that remains today is the G√ºtermann company in the neighboring community of Gutach. In contrast, optical and electrical manufacturing, represented in Waldkirch by the company SICK AG, has been enjoying steady growth since World War II, as has paper manufacturing represented by the company August Faller GmbH. Since 1877, a successful viticulture has been established in the district of Buchholz, which is also known trans-regionally for its cultivation of fruit and berries. In the district of Suggental, several silver mines were in use during the Middle Ages. Some parts of the mines are being uncovered and made accessible again by the mining research team Suggental, and tourist visits can be arranged (\\"Silberbergwerk Suggental\\"). Tourism is another important economic sector for Waldkirch, which is located alongside the German Clock Road (\\"Deutsche Uhrenstra√üe\\"), and is also a part of the Network of German Organ Road (\\"Kulturnetzwerk Deutsche Orgelstra√üe\\"). Friends of winter sports will enjoy the ski lifts on the local mountain, the Kandel. The most challenging slope is the partial valley run \\"Nordhang\\" (northern slope). Since April 30, 2016, Waldkirch has a new public open-air swimming pool in the district of Kollnau. = Transportation = Bahnhof Waldkirch Waldkirch is located along the Federal Highway (\\"Bundesstra√üe\\") 294 between Bretten and Freiburg im Breisgau. The road circumvents the town through the Hugenwaldtunnel to the south. The Kandel road (\\"Kandelstra√üe\\"), which starts at the northeastern edge of town, has connected Waldkirch to the Kandel since its construction in the 1930s, and was extended in the 1950s to the village of St. Peter. Waldkirch train station can be reached by the Elz Valley Railway (\\"Elztalbahn\\"), which is serviced by the regional railway operator \\"Breisgau S-Bahn\\" and runs half-hourly between Freiburg im Breisgau and Elzach.

Waldkirch is part of the regional public transportation authority \\"Regio-Verkehrsverbund Freiburg\\". The nearest international Airports are the EuroAirport Basel/Mulhouse/Freiburg, Zurich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, the Airport Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden and Strasbourg. = Local Businesses = Hauptsitz der Sick AG Some of Waldkirch's businesses are well-known beyond the immediate area, and a few operate worldwide - even as global market leaders in their field. Organ building is still an active trade, conducted by J√§ger and Brommer, Paul Fleck S√∂hne, Achim Schneider and Wolfram St√ºtzle. Mack Rides, a family business founded in Waldkirch in 1780, is one of the leading suppliers of amusement rides. Its former exhibition area in Rust is now home to the Europa Park, Germany's largest theme park. Another company located in Waldkirch is SICK AG, a manufacturer of industrial sensors and optical technology, with more than 8000 employees worldwide. The local company Ganter Interior is an owner-operated family business with a global market presence in interior construction and shop fitting. August Faller GmbH is another family business with its headquarters in Waldkirch, which was founded in 1882. It is one of the market leaders in pharmaceutical secondary packaging in German-speaking countries. = Courts and Administration = Waldkirch is the seat of the Waldkirch district court (\\"Amtsgericht Waldkirch\\"), which is part of the state court district of Freiburg im Breisgau, and the higher state court (\\"Oberlandesgericht, OLG\\") district of Karlsruhe, as well as the Notary's office for the municipalities of the Elztal. The former court prison next to the district court building was used as a branch of the Freiburg Prison (\\"JVA Freiburg\\"), housing day release prisoners. Since the closure of the prison branch, the building has been used as an office complex. Up until 2007, the city also housed the seat of a deanery for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg = Education = Schools located in Waldkirch include the Geschwister-Scholl-Gymnasium, the Realschule Kollnau, the primary school Schwarzenbergschule, the primary school and Hauptschule Kastelbergschule, the primary school and Hauptschule Buchholz, and the primary school and Hauptschule Kollnau.

Another important educational facility is the municipal music school (\\"St√§dtische Musikschule\\"). There is also a private school, the \\"Freie Schule Elztal\\". Additionally, the city runs a full-day program at the primary school and Hauptschule Kastelbergschule, as well as a child day-care center. So childcare for all ages between 0‚Äì16 years is being provided all under one roof.  Culture and sights  Waldkirch is situated on the German Clock Road, which passes many exhibition venues of ancient clocks and watch factories. The town is member of Citt√†slow, a Slow movement started in Italy in 1999 to increase the quality of urban life. =Monuments= * The town chapel of Our Lady is the oldest preserved building in town. The building dates back to 1336 and was established by the townspeople, so that they would not have to go to the St. Walburga Parish Church at that time outside the town walls, which was difficult in winter and dangerous in times of war. The chapel was rebuilt in 1931 and extended by the choir, in which the baroque high altar is placed. The side figures of this altar are attributed to Christian Wentzinger. In the church are images showing Stations of the Cross, which were created by Georg Scholz in the year 1938. He also briefly served as Mayor of the city after the end of the Second World War, before he died. The organ was built in 1894 by the organ builder Anton Kiene from Waldkirch and replaced an instrument from 1844. * The Catholic town church of St. Margarethen (former collegiate church of the Collegiate Abbey of the same name), built in 1732-1734 by the Vorarlberg Baroque architect Peter Thumb. * Church square with a completely preserved ensemble of baroque former canonist houses of the Collegiate St. Margarethen * Market square with historical buildings, including Waldkirch's town hall * Ruin of Kastelburg * Ruin of Schwarzenburg * Buchholz Castle = Museums = The Elztalmuseum, Kirchplatz 14, housed in the baroque former provost building, displays not only regional folk art and historical documents, but also important examples of Waldkirch barrel organ and musical instrument making. The latter is also shown at the Organ Builder's Hall, Am Gewerbekanal 1, which is run by the Waldkirch Orgelstiftung. = Other sights = * The gemstone cutting company Wintermantel, which is protected by the cultural heritage management, is one of the largest and oldest craft gemstone cutting shop preserved in the original and still in operation. It is the last remaining representative of a significant craft tradition in Breisgau. * The Black Forest Zoo in the immediate vicinity of the recreational facilities of the city lake is an attraction for children and families. * The medieval silver mine Suggental offers tours by appointment. * The treetop path. = Regular events = Every three years, the Waldkirch Organ Festival takes place. In the same interval, the historic marketplace festival takes place in Waldkirch in July. In addition, the tradition of the Swabian-Alemannic carnival is maintained in Waldkirch. It takes place in the week leading up to Lent. The Narrenzunft \\"Krakeelia\\" Waldkirch, a carnival guild, is one of the oldest in the region. At the \\"Schmutziger Dunschdig\\" (Dirty Thursday) traditionally the opening of the carnival takes place with a subsequent traditional procession. Two days later, Saturday, the Witches Sabbath of Kandelhexen takes place. Furthermore, the carnival parade through the city takes place on Sunday. On Rose Monday there is the traditional Elfimess (carnival speeches and drinks) for men. Among the customs of the Fasnet in Waldkirch is also the \\"Kl√§ppere\\" (a type of wooden musical instrument), in which two \\"Kl√§pperli\\" are used to make music by rhythmical flapping. There are regular cultural events in the AJZ Waldkirch e. V. as well as the municipal cinema of \\"Flap 11\\". = Sports = The SV Waldkirch is the largest sports club in the town.

It is located on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River along Route 132. The municipality of Cacouna was created in March 2006 through the amalgamation of the municipality of Saint-Georges-de-Cacouna and the parish of Saint-Georges-de-Cacouna. With a population of 1900, Cacouna is noted for the quality and unique architectural heritage of its buildings and for the richness and diversity of its agricultural life. The deep water port of Gros-Cacouna is a vital asset in the region's future development. Cacouna is a member of the association The Most Beautiful Villages in Quebec. 'Cacouna' is also the name of an Indian reserve of the Quebec Maliseet Nation, located in the administrative region of Bas- Saint-Laurent.  History  Cacouna Church ca. 1900 The land had been occupied since 1721, by a number of families. After the deportation of Acadians from Quebec in 1758, several Acadians established residence on the land, living as squatters. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, with the construction of the railway to Rivi√®re-du-Loup and the Maritime provinces, several wealthy Anglophone families from Montreal and Toronto built luxury villas in Cacouna, some of which still stand today. In the summer, the village was as a site of beachgoing, celebration and relaxation for these vacationers, providing employment to villagers working in the service industry. The vacationers began to slowly leave Cacouna during the Great Depression. Shipowner and banker Sir Montagu Allan had Ch√¢teau Montrose, his summer home, built at Cacouna in 1900. In 1941 Ch√¢teau Montrose was sold to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Cacouna is also the birthplace of Mario Dumont, former leader of the Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec.IMDB: Mario Dumas  Toponymy  Cacouna and the Charlevois mountains in the background seen from Saint-Arsene Many see in the name 'Cacouna' Cree words, kakwa or kakoua, meaning porcupine or dwelling or dwelling place of porcupine. The actual location of Cacouna, however, puts this interpretation in doubt as the Cree have never visited this region. The Montagnais could have given the area its name during one of their crossings of the Saint Lawrence River in the past, as the word kaku also means porcupine in their language. More likely, though, the name could have come from the Maliseet word kakona. The name 'Saint George' was retained by Bishop Plessis in 1809 at the request of Malcolm Fraser, lord of Murray Bay (La Malbaie) from 1733 to 1815. Saint George, an officer martyred in Palestine in 303 AD, is a patron of the English people and his battle against the dragon has been represented multiple times in art.

Port of Gros Cacouna  Port of Gros-Cacouna The port of Gros Cacouna is a deep-water seaport with a water depth of .Arrimage Qu√©bec ‚Äì Port de Gros-Cacouna It was inaugurated in 1981, after a wait of over 25 years due to regional proceedings. The quantity of raw material transhipped in the port has decreased significantly over the last ten years. In 1995, the port was mostly used to export 290,000 tonnes of forest and pulp and paper products. Yet, only 20,000 tons of these products were loaded in 2005. They were partially replaced by cement (100,000 tonnes in 2005) exported to the Great Lakes region in the United States. The port is also used to unload cement imported from Brazil (50,000 tons in 2005), road salt from the Magdalen Islands and various metal products. Since 2005, several wind turbine parts have also been transhipped in the port. = Cacouna Energy = A controversial project of building a methane terminal in the port of Gros Cacouna was announced on September 1, 2004. The project was proposed by Cacouna Energy, a consortium of TransCanada Pipelines and Petro-Canada. According to the proposed scenario, liquefied natural gas would be imported from Russia to Gros-Cacouna, where it would be regasified and then distributed on the North- American market via a new gas pipeline. A joint review panel composed of the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency submitted its report on November 1, 2006. The panel concluded that the project would be unlikely to have significant environmental impacts as long as the panel's recommendations were followed and that mitigation measures were implanted. In 2008, the proponent announced that it would delay its methane terminal project indefinitely\\"La Presse\\", Petro Canada suspend le projet de Gros Cacouna, January 31, 2011 until the supply conditions of liquefied natural gas improved in the worldwide market.\\"La Presse\\", Tout cela pour cela?,February 16, 2009 =Energy East proposal= On November 10, 2014, it was revealed by The Globe and Mail that the terminus of the proposed petroleum pipeline called 'Energy East' would be located in Cacouna.G+M: \\"Quebeckers aren‚Äôt being shown the pipeline big picture\\" 10 Nov 2014 TransCanada's target market for the goods is Total SA, a French petroleum refiner which is part-owned by the Desmarais family, who have interests in the oil sands of Alberta. The oil will transit from the North shore of the St. Lawrence River at the Quebec Bridge, to reach the south shore at Levis, Quebec. The economics of trans-oceanic shipment is the chief reason for this new port installation.

The Circle of Tchaikovsky, also known as Tchaikovtsy, Chaikovtsy, or the Grand Propaganda Society (–ß–∞–π–∫–æ–≤—Ü—ã, Chaykovtsy; –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥—ã Bolshoye obshchestvo propagandy in Russian) was a Russian literary society for self-education and a revolutionary organization of the Narodniks in the early 1870s. It was named after Nikolai Tchaikovsky, one of its prominent members.  Background and origin  The intelligentsia of mid- nineteenth century Tsarist Russia were dissatisfied with what they saw as social stagnation of the nation and had begun to demand reform. Their attitude was notably characterised by novelist Ivan Turgenev as nihilism. The peak of this social activism gave rise to a number of secret organisations, among them Land and Liberty, People's Revenge, and the Circle of Tchaikovsky. The Circle was founded in St. Petersburg during student unrest in 1868-1869 as a group opposed to the reckless violence of Sergey Nechayev. A literary society for self-education within the Medical Surgical Academy was the heart of the organization, the initial purpose of which was to share books and knowledge that had been banned in the Russian Empire. It included students Mark Natanson, V. M. Aleksandrov, and Anatoly Serdyukov, who were joined by Nikolai Tchaikovsky and Feofan Lermontov. Besides self-education, the circle's main tasks were to unite students of Petersburg and other cities, and conduct propaganda among workers and peasants with the purpose of fomenting a social revolution. The Tchaikovsky set higher moral standards for their members in the face of Nechayev's unscrupulousness. They had a negative attitude towards struggle for political freedoms, which, in their view, were only advantageous to the arising Russian bourgeoisie. These principles were formulated in the –ü—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞ –¥–ª—è –∫—Ä—É–∂–∫–æ–≤ —Å–∞–º–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (Program for the circles of self-education and practical activity), put together by the Tchaikovtsy in late 1870 ‚Äì early 1871.  Activities  One of the first tasks of the Tchaikovtsy was to organize the printing, publishing, and distribution of scientific and revolutionary literature with the help of publishers Nikolai Polyakov, Kozma Soldatyonkov, and others. These literary works included the first volume of Das Kapital by Karl Marx, and books by others including Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Nikolai Dobrolyubov, Alexander Herzen, Pyotr Lavrov, Vasili Bervi, Ferdinand Lassalle, Charles Darwin, and John Stuart Mill. In the summer of 1871, the circle of Natanson merged with a female self-education circle of Alexandra Kornilova and Sophia Perovskaya. Soon, they were joined by Peter Kropotkin, Sergei Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, Dmitry Klements, Sergei Sinegub, Nikolai Charushin, Leonid Shishko, and others. The central Petersburg circle comprised around 60 people. Circles in Moscow (Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, Lev Tikhomirov, Mikhail Frolenko), Odessa (Felix Volkhovsky, Andrei Zhelyabov), Kiev (Yakov Stefanovich, Pavel Axelrod) and other cities sided with the Petersburg cell on a federal basis. Altogether, the Tchaikovtsy numbered around 100 participants. In 1872, the Tchaikovtsy began organizing circles of workers with the purpose of training propagandists for work in the countryside. These activities were most successful in Petersburg and Odessa, where the circles comprised around 400 workers. Some of these workers‚Äîincluding Viktor Obnorsky and Feodor Kravchenko‚Äîwould later become the founders of the first proletarian organizations such as the Worker's Union of Southern Russia (–Æ–∂–Ω–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ—é–∑ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö) and Northern Union of the Russian Workers (–°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Å–æ—é–∑ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö). The results of this propaganda work were summarized in a report by Peter Kropotkin, which would be discussed in the Petersburg circle of the Tchaikovtsy in late 1873. The final stage of activities of the Tchaikovtsy included the Call to the People campaign, bringing revolutionary propaganda and organization directly to the peasants of Russia. In 1873/1874, most members of the circle were arrested and were later prosecuted in the trial of the 193. Tschaikovsky joined a religious-communist group and emigrated to the United States in 1874.

The word derives from currere, to run. It may be applied, for example, to a course of study or of medical treatment or to a race-course. Roman race- course. At its simplest, the Roman race-course took the form of two posts; each called a discrimen or a meta, round which the runners, whether on foot, on horses or in chariots, raced. The normal arrangement was more formalised as two straights, separated by a spina but very close to each other and with a very tight turn at each turning point. It was the similarity in appearance of this Roman cursus to the Neolithic archaeological feature which led 18th century antiquarians to use the same name for the latter. This combination of straight and tight turn combined the thrills of speed on the straights with those of danger as collisions and falls were likely on the turns. The distinction between a cursus and a circus in connection with racing is not wholly clear. Compare the description above with that of the Circus Maximus.

With the exception of one late-surviving lepospondyl from the Late Permian of Morocco (Diplocaulus minumus), lepospondyls lived from the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) to the Early Permian and were geographically restricted to what is now Europe and North America.Carroll, R. L. (1988) Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution, WH Freeman & Co. Five major groups of lepospondyls are known: Adelospondyli; A√Østopoda; Lysorophia; Microsauria; and Nectridea. Lepospondyls have a diverse range of body forms and include species with newt- like, eel- or snake-like, and lizard-like forms. Various species were aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial. None were large (the biggest genus, the diplocaulid Diplocaulus, reached a meter in length, but most were much smaller), and they are assumed to have lived in specialized ecological niches not taken by the more numerous temnospondyl amphibians that coexisted with them in the Paleozoic. Lepospondyli was named in 1888 by Karl Alfred von Zittel, who coined the name to include some tetrapods from the Paleozoic, that shared some specific characteristics in the notochord and teeth. Lepospondyls have sometimes been considered to be either related or ancestral to modern amphibians or to Amniota (the clade containing reptiles and mammals). Description All lepospondyls are characterised by having simple, spool- shaped vertebrae that did not ossify from cartilage, but rather grew as bony cylinders around the notochord. In addition, the upper portion of the vertebra, the neural arch, is usually fused to the centrum (the main body of the vertebra).Colbert 1969 Classification The position of the Lepospondyli within the Tetrapoda is uncertain because the earliest lepospondyls were already highly specialized when they first appeared in the fossil record. Some lepospondyls were once thought to be related or perhaps ancestral to modern salamanders (Urodela), but not the other modern amphibians. This view is no longer held and all modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are now grouped within the clade Lissamphibia. For a long time, the Lepospondyli were considered one of the three subclasses of Amphibia, along with the Lissamphibia and the Labyrinthodontia.Romer 1966Carroll 1988 However, the dissolution of \\"labyrinthodonts\\" into separate groups such as temnospondyls and anthracosaurs has cast doubt on these traditional amphibian subclasses. Marjanovic & Laurin 2009 tree from SOM Much like \\"Labyrinthodontia\\", some studies proposed that Lepospondyli is an artificial (polyphyletic) grouping with some members closely related to extinct stem tetrapod groups and others more closely related to modern amphibians or reptiles.Benton 2000 Early phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1980s and 1990s often maintained the idea that lepospondyls were paraphyletic, with nectrideans close to colosteids and microsaurs close to temnospondyls, which were considered to be ancestral to modern amphibians. However, a 1995 paper by Robert Carroll argued that lepospondyls were actually a monophyletic group closer to reptiles. Carroll considered them closer to reptiles than the seymouriamorphs, but not as close as the diadectomorphs. Many phylogenetic analyses since Carroll (1995) agreed with his interpretation, including Laurin & Reisz (1997), Anderson (2001), and Ruta et al. (2003). A few have still considered lepospondyls ancestral to amphibians, but came to this conclusion without changing the position of lepospondyls compared to seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs. Lepospondyl and tetrapod classification is still controversial, and even recent studies have had doubts about lepospondyl monophyly. For example, a 2007 paper has suggested that adelospondyls are stem-tetrapods close to colosteids and a 2017 paper on Lethiscus has A√Østopoda in the tetrapod stem based on their primitive braincase. These studies differ in the internal and external relationships of the remaining lepospondyl taxa. The former places the remaining lepospondyls into a single clade along the amniote stem. The latter does not treat the relationships of nectrideans or adelospondyls, but finds microsaurs to be early amniotes, and places lysorophians within microsaurs. =Interrelationships= Five main groups of lepospondyls are often recognized: Microsauria, a superficially lizard- or salamander-like and species-rich group; Lysorophia, a group with elongated bodies and very small limbs; A√Østopoda, a group of limbless, extremely elongated snake-like forms; Adelospondyli, a group of presumably aquatic forms that resemble a√Østopods, but have more solidly built skulls; and Nectridea, another diverse group that includes terrestrial and aquatic newt-like forms. Microsauria is generally considered paraphyletic; rather than being a monophyletic group, it has been considered an evolutionary grade of basal (\\"primitive\\") lepospondyls, although there is growing consensus that a large subset of fossorially-adapted microsaurs, the Recumbirostra, is monophyletic. Lysorophia may belong within the Recumbirostran clade, distinct from other derived lepospondyls. Nectridea may also be paraphyletic, consisting of a range of more anatomically- specialized lepospondyls. The name Holospondyli has been proposed for a clade including a√Østopods, and nectrideans, and possibly adelospondyls, although not all recent phylogenetic analyses support the grouping. The following cladogram, simplified, is after an analysis of tetrapods and stem-tetrapods presented by Ruta et al. in 2003: =Position within Tetrapoda= The \\"lepospondyl hypothesis\\" of modern amphibian origins proposes that lissamphibians are monophyletic (that is, they form their own clade) and that they evolved from lepospondyl ancestors. Two alternatives are the \\"temnospondyl hypothesis\\", in which lissamphibians originated within Temnospondyli, and the \\"polyphyly hypothesis\\", in which caecilians originated from lepospondyls while frogs and salamanders (collectively grouped within Batrachia) evolved from temnospondyls. Of the three hypotheses, the temnospondyl hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted among researchers. Strong support for this relationship comes from a suite of anatomical features shared between lissamphibians and a group of Paleozoic temnospondyls called dissorophoids. Under this hypothesis, Lepospondyli either falls outside crown group Tetrapoda (the smallest clade containing all living tetrapods, i.e. the smallest clade containing Lissamphibia and Amniota), or is closer to amniotes and therefore part of Reptiliomorpha. However, some phylogenetic analyses continue to find support for the lepospondyl hypothesis. The analysis by Vallin and Laurin (2004) found lissamphibians to be most closely related to lysorophians, followed by microsaurs. Pawley (2006) also found lysorophians to be the closest relatives of lissamphibians, but found a√Østopods and adelogyrinids rather than microsaurs to be the second most closely related groups. Marjanoviƒá (2010) found holospondyls to be the most closely related group to lissamphibians, followed by lysorophians. Under this hypothesis, lepospondyls would be crown tetrapods and temnospondyls would be stem tetrapods. Below is a cladogram from Ruta et al.

It is a deciduous tree growing to tall, rarely , and 40‚Äì80 cm stem diameter, with light grey bark. The leaves are pinnate, 50‚Äì90 cm long, with 11-17 leaflets, each leaflet 7‚Äì16 cm long and 3‚Äì5 cm broad. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves. The male flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green catkins produced in spring at the same time as the new leaves appear. The female flowers have pink/ red pistils. The fruit is a nut, produced in bunches of 4-10 together; the nut is spherical, 3‚Äì5 cm long and broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in mid autumn. Uses The edible nuts have an oily texture. The husks are also used to make a yellowish dye. The very bold, decorative leaves and the attractive catkins produced in spring make it an excellent ornamental tree for planting in parks and large gardens.

This has led to its being planted as a replacement for butternuts in North America. The two species hybridise readily; the resulting hybrid Juglans x bixbyi (otherwise known as J. cinerea x ailantifolia or 'buartnut') is also resistant to canker and is likewise planted as a replacement for butternuts. Japanese walnut is distinguished from butternut by its larger leaves and round (not oval) nuts. Prospect Rock Permaculture in Vermont has been backcrossing buartnuts with native butternuts, resulting in 'butterbuarts', which will most likely bear greater resemblance to the butternut parentage, although may also be more susceptible to the canker. The wood is light and takes polish well, but is of much lower quality than Persian walnut wood. It is often used to make furniture. Cultivars The heartnut is a cultivar of Japanese walnut distinguished by its fruit, which is heart-shaped in cross-section, very hard to crack, and able to yield unbroken nut meat when cracked. The heartnut is a sweet nut without a bitter aftertaste often intrinsic with black and Persian walnuts. This is the subspecies that hybridizes with butternuts, creating 'buartnuts', or Juglans x bixbyi. Toyo Tire evaluated that the shell was very hard and that the fragments were sharp, and it came to be used as a material for snow tires (studless tires). Diseases The only significant disease Japanese walnuts are susceptible to is the Walnut Bunch Disease.

It is the largest raised peat bog and the largest undeveloped urban land mass on the West Coast of the Americas. Burns Bog was originally before development. Currently, only remain of the bog. Burns Bog is habitat to more than 300 plant and animal species, and 175 bird species. Some of these animals are listed as endangered (i.e. red-listed) or vulnerable (i.e. blue-listed) under the BC Provincial Government Species at-risk designations. The bog is also a major migratory stopover for various bird species on the Pacific Flyway. Burns Bog regulates water as well. The bog prevents flooding, maintains cool water temperatures in nearby rivers, holds water, and releases water in dry conditions. Burns Bog is an estuarine bog since it is situated at the mouth of the Fraser River and next to the Pacific Ocean. It is the only estuarine raised peat bog formed in a marine west coast climate.  Ecology  = Characteristics = The major characteristics of Burns Bog is that it is wet, acidic, and peat-forming. It is a wetland ecosystem with a diverse array of plant, animal, and insect species. A major component of Burns Bog is sphagnum moss, which is able to hold about 30 times its weight in water. Sphagnum moss can grow under wet and acidic conditions and it is the major building block of peat in Burns Bog. thumbAn adequate water table is critical to a bog's survival Diagram designed by Aliya Khan Breakdown of organic matter in the bog progresses slowly due to low oxygen content and high acidity of the water. Burns Bog plays a major role in climate regulation. It helps to maintain the health of nearby creeks, which are critical salmon-bearing sites. The peat in the bog does this by cooling and filtering rainwater that comes in. This water then leaches into these salmon-bearing creeks. Burns Bog is also a major carbon sink. Since organic matter decomposes at a very slow rate in the bog, carbon stays in the bog. High acidity and the waterlogged conditions of peatlands such as Burns Bog prevent complete decomposition of fixed carbon. This prevents the carbon from escaping into the atmosphere. European scientists state that an area of peatland the size of a soccer field stores as much carbon as would be generated by driving a family car around the world three times. = Formation = Burns Bog was formed at the end of the last ice age, which was 10,000 years ago. At the time, the area was covered in huge glaciers. As the earth's atmospheric temperature started to rise, the glaciers melted. Sand, silt, and clay were deposited on top of the ground, which prevented water drainage at this location. This created a big pool of glacial water that had no means of escaping or draining. 6,000 years after glacial melting, the aquatic environment was capable of preserving dead plant material in the form of peat. At this time, peat was composed of grass and woody plants. The depression did not contain sphagnum moss until 3,000 years later. As the peat deposits increased, the main water source changed from nutrient-rich flood water and ground water to nutrient-poor rainfall. Continuous organic matter build-up on the surface of the depression made the peat more acidic. The surface of this wetland slowly separated from groundwater sources, and the environment switched from a fen to a bog. A fen contains more nutrients than a raised peat bog; ergo, the ecosystems are very different. Many years after the appearance of sphagnum moss in the depression, peat accumulated thickest near the centre of the bog. Today, there are 12 species of sphagnum moss that can be found in Burns Bog. = Hydrology = Burns Bog receives water primarily from rainfall. Water is used by the plants via evaporation, or moved into the air via transpiration. Proper hydrology of the bog is critical to its survival. The water level needs to be high enough so that it can sustain growth of sphagnum moss. A low water table in bogs can lead to irreversible drying of bogland, which can be detrimental to its ecosystem. In Burns Bog, the water table fluctuates at different times in the year. The water table tends to be high in the fall and winter periods, but drops during the summer months. = Biodiversity = Sphagnum moss is known as a \\"bog builder.\\" It is critical to Burns Bog's survival. There are more than 14 different plant communities in Burns Bog. The most important as deemed by the City of Delta are \\"peat-forming\\". Peat-forming plants are those that grow in places with a high water table (e.g. sphagnum mosses). Cloudberries, crowberry, velvet-leaf blueberry, and bog-rosemary are some of the rare plants found in Burns Bog. Carnivorous plant populations reside in the bog as well. The sundew plant can be found in the conservancy area and in the Delta Nature Reserve. Many skunk cabbage plants are seen in the Delta Nature Reserve during the summer months as well. Burns Bog is home to many animal species. According to the City of Delta, the bog sustains 175 bird species, 11 amphibian species, 41 species of mammals, 6 reptile species, and more than 4,000 invertebrates. The Greater Sandhill Crane, black-tailed deer, dragonflies, and eagles make Burns Bog their home. Beavers are found in Burns Bog and The Delta Nature Reserve. They live in the banks of the waterways rather than in the lodges. Others animals that can be found in Burns Bog are the redback vole, pacific water shrew, barred owl, great blue heron, snow shoe hare, great horned owl, coyote, geese, ducks, California gull, painted turtle, red-legged frog, and woodpeckers. Fish have been seen at the edge of Burns Bog, but none are known to live inside the bog. The water is highly acidic and low in oxygen; thus, the fish cannot live in these conditions.  History  = First Nations land use = Labrador Tea (taken at the Delta Nature Reserve) First Nation bands used the land in Burns Bog for thousands of years. These bands were the Tsawwassen, Semiahmoo, Sto:lo, Katzie, and Musqueam First Nations peoples. First Nations practiced the regulated burning of land patches. This was to promote growth of different berries. Berries such as the bog blueberry and cranberry were an important part of their diet. Another source of food came from animals living in the area. Hunting of black bears, black-tailed deer, elks, and ducks were common. Fishing in the creeks nearby provided First Nations with dietary supplements. In fact, the oldest known fishing archaeological site near Burns Bog is estimated to be 4,500 years old. Cedar trees in the region were used by First Nations to construct infrastructure, transportation, and clothing. Totem poles were built using cedar as well. First Nations people utilized some of the plants in Burns Bog for medicinal purposes. Labrador tea, western bog-laurel, sundew plants, and sphagnum moss were used to treat different medical conditions. For example, Labrador tea was used to treat sore throats, and coughs, among many other symptoms. Sphagnum moss was used as diapers and bandaids by the First Nations groups. = Modern history = In 1905, Dominic Burns and his brother purchased the bog. They wanted to raise cattle and sheep, but the cows were too heavy and easily stuck in the bog. Some of them ate the poisonous plants in the bog. Thus, the cattle farm closed and moved up north. The bog was later named after Dominic Burns. Peat mining in Burns Bog started in the 1930s. Mined peat was used for agricultural purposes, weapon production, and as a fuel to heat homes. Two peat plants were established in Burns Bog. During World War II, the US Government purchased peat from Burns Bog to catalyze the formation of firebombs. More than 100,000 bales of peat were shipped to Las Vegas during the war period. By the early 1940s, seventy percent of the bog was affected by peat extraction. Railways were constructed during the peat harvesting era as well. In the 1950s, a company called Western Peat built 16 kilometres of railway in Burns Bog. The railway still exists in the bog today. There have been various development plans proposed in Burns Bog. In 1988, Western Delta Lands proposed the development of a deep-sea port on Burns Bog. After much public opposition, Delta Council rejected the proposal. The company tried twice again in 1990 and 1991, but both proposals were defeated. In 1995, well- known British bog expert David Bellamy visited Burns Bog. Upon seeing its globally unique ecosystem, he urged the community to protect the bog. Bellamy stated that the bog would be protected if it were in Europe. Unfortunately, nothing came of his advice until a few years later. In 1996, Delta, the City of Vancouver, and GVRD struck a deal to move the Vancouver Landfill to the southern region of Burns Bog. In 1999, 75% of Delta voters agree to have the government purchase Burns Bog for conservation. The \\"yes\\" vote led to taxpayer contribution (0.3% levy included in utility taxes in 2001 for possible purchase of Burns Bog). Western Delta Lands proposed development plans in Burns Bog yet again in 1999, which prompts an ecosystem review of Burns Bog. A comprehensive study of Burns Bog's ecosystem indicated that 73% of Burns Bog (~ of ) must be protected to maintain its ecological integrity. After much public rallying, four levels of government purchase of land from Western Delta Lands.  Fires  Highway 91 Dry peat can catch and spread fire rapidly. Thus, fires in Burns Bog can burn underground for months in methane-rich peat. Large fires occurred in Burns Bog in 1977, twice in 1990, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2007, and 2016. The 1996 fire engulfed the city of Vancouver in smoke and ash for two days. The fire destroyed of land and cost over $200,000 to put out. Another fire broke out in Burns Bog on September 11, 2005. The fire broke out near the south eastern edge of the bog. Smoke and ash covered the entire Lower Mainland and spread all the way to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. The fire expanded to hectares after three days. Large-scale fighting methods were used to combat the blaze. This included firebreaks being bulldozed and dikes to raise the water level in the hopes of extinguishing any of the fire burning underground. BC Fire Service's Air Tanker Centre dispatched a fleet of air tankers to assist in putting out the blaze. This included four Firecats, two Convair 580s and the Martin Mars water bombers, which are the world's largest air tankers. Eight days after the fire first set blaze, Delta municipality announced that the fire was in \\"mop-up\\" stages. On July 3, 2016, another fire broke out and grew to over the next three days. More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze using helicopters and air tankers, with additional crew.  Conservation  The Delta community and environmental organizations such as the Burns Bog Conservation Society rallied for the bog's conservation since development plans were first proposed in 1988. Burns Bog was first requested to be designated an ecological reserve came in 1991. The proposal was rejected by most of Delta Council, with plans for reconsideration at the City's Official Community Plan. By 1999, hundreds of letters were sent by the community to Delta Council asking them to save Burns Bog. In 2004, four levels of government came together to purchase of land for $73 million. The four levels of government were the federal government, the provincial government, Metro Vancouver, and The Corporation of Delta. Burns Bog was officially designated as an Ecological Conservancy Area in 2005. Priority of the area was conservation and not public use. A special permit issued by Metro Vancouver is required to enter the conservancy area. On September 22, 2012, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands announced designation of Burns Bog as a Ramsar Wetland of International Significance. The bog was listed as part of the Fraser River Delta Ramsar site No. 243, along with South Arm Marshes, Sturgeon Bank, Boundary Bay, Serpentine, and Alaksen. Burns Bog is listed under the Fraser River Delta Ramsar Site as a wetland of international significance because it is a major migratory bird stopover on the Pacific Flyway. It also provides feeding and roosting for approximately 250,000 migratory and wintering waterfowl, and 1 million shorebirds. The bog is home to a number of endangered and vulnerable animal species. = Current threats = Today, of Burns Bog remains private land. This land is not protected under the conservancy plan set up by the levels of government. Thus, these parcels of land are vulnerable to project proposals. Manmade developments have isolated Burns Bog from other natural areas. Roads cut off safe passageways for animals to get into and out of the bog. This increases the likelihood of animal injury and mortality. The construction of Highway 91 has prevented periodic flooding and drainage that previously fed into the bog. A University of British Columbia study states that construction of Highway 91 and 99 caused Burns Bog to shrink significantly in size. Burns Bog functions as a single living organism. The smaller it gets, the less chance the entire bog has of surviving. The Vancouver Landfill poses two risks to Burns Bog. The first risk is that breakdown of garbage produces more nutrients, which is the opposite of what a bog needs. The second risk is that there may be contaminated water leeching from the landfill into the bog. Engineers have designed the landfill in a way that minimizes these risks to Burns bog. While the logging industry and peat mining have come to a halt in Burns Bog, the damage is still being felt today. The City of Delta is working to recover as much of Burns Bog as they can. Metro Vancouver and the City of Delta work alongside university students to monitor the health of Burns Bog. MK Delta Lands Group is proposing to build an industrial park in Burns Bog. The company plans to build west of Highway 91. Construction of an overpass leading to the site and a new water pump to drain the area of bog land is included in their plans. As part of their proposal, MK Delta is giving their other land parcels in Burns Bog (Lot A, B, C) to the City of Delta. The drainage, construction, and noise created from this project would be detrimental to Burns Bog's natural ecosystem. MK Delta Lands Group's application is still in the early stages.  Public access (The Delta Nature Reserve) Most of Burns Bog is closed off to the public due to safety and conservation concerns. A small portion of Burns Bog is accessible to the public. This area is referred to as the Delta Nature Reserve and is in size. The Delta Nature Reserve gives a glimpse of the bog's lagg zone, which is the transition zone between a peat bog and the external ecosystems. The lagg zone is crucial to the bog's survival. Lagg zones in peat bogs are critical for keeping the high water table of the bog. They are the transition zones between low-nutrient peat bogs and the high-nutrient, or in this case human disturbed, areas. Different ecosystems work together to maintain the health of the bog. The Burns Bog Conservation Society has built more than of boardwalk in the Delta Nature Reserve. They provide a safe and easy access to all members of the community. In February 2017, the City of Delta took over responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of all boardwalks in the Delta Nature Reserve.

Persian Arab generally refers to people who are of both mixed Arab and Persian ethnic or cultural background, which is common in some parts of Iraq and Iran. History and current situation In pre-Islamic times, there were many Arabs who lived in the cultural sphere of Persia and used Persian as their written language. These are referred to as Persian Arabs (in Arabic ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ Arab al-Furas). One of Prophet Muhammed's early followers and disciples, Salman Al-Farsi, was Persian. After the rise of Islam and the Arab conquest of Persia, Persians, in turn, began to use Arabic as their written language alongside Persian. Many famous Islamic scientists and philosophers during the time of the Abbasid caliphate were ethnic Persians who wrote their scholarly works in Arabic while continuing to write literary works and poetry in Persian - famous examples are Avicenna and Khayyam. Self-identification The term Persian Arab is rarely used as a self-appellation. Most tend to identify more strongly as either Persian or Arab and consider themselves to be members primarily of one ethnic group, but at the same time being aware of their mixed background. For many the most important factor determining their identity is the sovereign state in which they live or from which their recent ancestors came from. In Iran Ethnic Arabs and Arabic speakers living primarily in the Khuzestan province of Iran. Some of them self-identify as Iranian Arabs, Persians or just Ahvazis (see Ahvaz), and consider their mother tongue to be Arabic, though almost all are bilingual in Persian and many may have a better command of written Persian than written Arabic, since the medium of education at schools in Iran is Persian. Some Arabs (e.g. those of the Khamseh clans) even use Persian as the first language.

The first structure dates to the 4th century, though future emperors would add to and improve upon it.Krautheimer (1992) It was second in size and importance only to the Hagia Sophia among the great churches of the capital. When Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453, the Holy Apostles briefly became the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church. Three years later the edifice, which was in a dilapidated state, was abandoned by the Patriarch, and in 1461 it was demolished by the Ottomans to make way for the Fatih Mosque.M√ºller-Wiener (1977) p. 406  History  The original church of the Holy Apostles was dedicated in about 330 by Constantine the Great, the founder of Constantinople, the new capital of the Roman Empire. The church was unfinished when Constantine died in 337, and it was brought to completion by his son and successor Constantius II, who buried his father's remains there. The church was dedicated to the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and it was the Emperor's intention to gather relics of all the Apostles in the church. For this undertaking, only relics of Saint Andrew, Saint Luke and Saint Timothy (the latter two not strictly apostles) were acquired, and in later centuries it came to be assumed that the church was dedicated to these three only. By the reign of the Emperor Justinian I, the church was no longer considered grand enough, and a new Church of the Holy Apostles was built on the same site. The historian Procopius attributes the rebuilding to Justinian, while the writer known as Pseudo-Codinus attributes it to the Empress Theodora. The new church was designed and built by the architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus, the same architects of the Hagia Sophia, and was consecrated on 28 June 550. The relics of Constantine and the three saints were re-installed in the new church, and a mausoleum for Justinian and his family was built at the end of its northern arm. For more than 700 years, the church of the Holy Apostles was the second-most important church in Constantinople, after that of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia). But whereas the church of the Holy Wisdom was in the city's oldest part, that of the Holy Apostles stood in the centre of the newer part of the much expanded imperial capital, on the great thoroughfare called Mese Od√≥s (), and was the city's busiest church. Most emperors and many patriarchs and bishops were buried in the church, and their relics were venerated by the faithful for centuries. The church's most treasured possessions were the skulls of Saints Andrew, Luke and Timothy, but the church also held what was believed to be part of the \\"Column of Flagellation\\", to which Jesus had been bound and flogged. Its treasury also held relics of Saint John Chrysostom and other Church Fathers, saints and martyrs. Over the years the church acquired huge amounts of gold, silver and gems donated by the faithful. Emperor Basil I renovated and probably enlarged the church, and in 874 the remains of the historian and patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, who had died earlier in the century, were reinterred in the popular and rebuilt church, where they became the site of annual imperial devotion. In the 10th century Constantine of Rhodes composed a Description of the building of the Apostles in verse, which he dedicated to Constantine VII. The basilica was looted during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The historian Nicetas Choniates records that the Crusaders plundered the imperial tombs and robbed them of gold and gems. Not even Justinian's tomb was spared. The tomb of Emperor Heraclius was opened and his golden crown was stolen along with the late Emperor's hairs still attached on it. Some of these treasures were taken to Venice, where they can still be seen in St Mark's Basilica, while the body of St. Gregory was brought to Rome.Janin (1953), p. 48 When Michael VIII Palaeologus recaptured the city from the Crusaders, he erected a statue of the Archangel Michael at the church to commemorate the event, and himself. The church was partially restored again by Andronicus II Palaeologus in the early 14th century, but thereafter fell into disrepair as the Empire declined and Constantinople's population fell. The Florentine Cristoforo Buondelmonti saw the dilapidated church in 1420. In 1453 Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. The cathedral church of Hagia Sophia was seized and turned into a mosque, and the Sultan Mehmed II reassigned to the Orthodox Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius the church of the Holy Apostles, which thus temporarily became the new administrative centre of the Ecumenical Orthodox Church. But the Church was in a dilapidated state, and the area around the church was inappropriate and soon settled by Muslims. After the killing of a Muslim by an Orthodox citizen, the Muslim dwellers became hostile to the Christians,Janin (1953), p. 50 so that in 1456 Gennadius therefore decided to move the Patriarchate to the Church of St Mary Pammakaristos in the √áar≈üamba neighbourhood. After the demolition of the dilapidated church in 1462, from 1463 to 1470 the Sultan built on the 11 hectare site a mosque complex of comparable magnificence. The result was the Fatih Cami (), which‚Äîalthough rebuilt after its destruction because of the earthquake of 1766‚Äîstill occupies the site and houses Mehmed's tomb.  Descriptions and influence  = Constantine's building = The grounds of the first church of the Holy Apostles contained both a rotunda mausoleum built by Constantine and a church built soon afterward by his successor Constantius. Little is known of the appearance of this original church except that it was cross-shaped, but the historian Eusebius (c. 263‚Äì339) gives the following description of Constantine's mausoleum and the surrounding grounds before Constantius' church was built:Eusebius Caesariensis. Vita Constantini [Schaff] [0265-0339] Full text at Documenta Catholica Omnia > This building he carried to a vast height, and brilliantly decorated by > encasing it from the foundation to the roof with marble slabs of various > colors. He also formed the inner roof of finely fretted work, and overlaid > it throughout with gold. The external covering, which protected the building > from the rain, was of brass instead of tiles; and this too was splendidly > and profusely adorned with gold, and reflected the sun‚Äôs rays with a > brilliancy which dazzled the distant beholder. The dome was entirely > encompassed by a finely carved tracery, wrought in brass and gold. Such was > the magnificence with which the emperor was pleased to beautify this church. > The building was surrounded by an open area of great extent, the four sides > of which were terminated by porticos which enclosed the area and the church > itself. Adjoining these porticos were ranges of stately chambers, with baths > and promenades, and besides many apartments adapted to the use of those who > had charge of the place. The cruciform plan was a landmark development in Christian architecture, because it replaced a basilica plan with the centralized shrine plan.Nuttgens, Patrick. The Story of Architecture. Hong Kong, Phaidon Press Limited. 1997. Dozens of cruciform church buildings in the late fourth and early fifth centuries were rough imitations of the Constantine-era Church of the Holy Apostles, such as St. Ambrose's Church of the Apostles in Milan, the martyrium of St. Babylas in Antioch, and the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites in Aleppo, Syria. = Justinian's building = The second church, built under Justinian I, was also cruciform but was surmounted by five domes: one above each arm of the cross and one above the central bay where the arms intersected. The western arm of the cross extended farther than the others, forming an atrium. The design details of the building are a matter of dispute. The contemporary historian Procopius (c. 500‚Äì565) gives the following description: > Two straight lines were drawn, intersecting each other in the middle of the > form of a cross, one extending east and west, and the other which crossed > this running north and south. On the outside these lines were defined by > walls on all of the sides, while on the inside they were traced by rows of > columns standing above one another. At the crossing of the two straight > lines, that is to say at about the middle, there was set aside a place which > may not be entered by those who may not celebrate the mysteries; this with > good reason they call the \\"sanctuary.\\" The two arms of this enclosure which > lie along the transverse line are equal to each other, but the arm which > extends toward the west, along the upright line, is enough longer than the > other to make the form of the cross. That portion of the roof which is above > the sanctuary, as it is called, is built, in the center at least, on a plan > resembling the Church of Sophia, except that it is inferior to it in size. > The arches, four in number, rise aloft and are bound together in the same > manner and the circular drum which stands upon them is pierced by windows, > and the dome which arches above this seems to float in the air and not to > rest upon solid masonry, though actually it is well supported. Thus, then, > was the central part of the roof constructed. And the arms of the building, > which are four,... were roofed on the same plan as the central portion, but > this one feature is lacking: underneath the domes the masonry is not pierced > by windows. A tenth century poem by Constantine the Rodian, or Constantine of Rhodes, preserved in a fifteenth century manuscript and contains an ekphrasis and description of the church. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The 12th century writer Nicholas Mesarites also recorded a description of the church, of which only fragments survive. Although there are brief mentions of the building in a variety of sources, the accounts of Procopius, Constantine of Rhodes, and Nicholas Mesarites are the only known substantial textual descriptions of the building's appearance. Churches such as the Basilica of St. John, St Mark's Basilica, Cath√©drale Saint-Front, and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are believed to have been modeled on Justinian's Holy Apostles, but they differ from each other significantly.Kimball, F., & Edgell, G. H. (1918). A History of Architecture. New York. Harper & Brothers. 621 pages (page 252).  Burials  Porphyry sarcophagi of Byzantine emperors on display outside the Istanbul Archaeology Museums. The church's mausoleums were the resting place for most Eastern Roman emperors and members of their families for seven centuries, beginning with Constantine I (d. 337) and ending with Constantine VIII (d. 1028). With no more space available at that time, emperors began to be buried in other churches and monasteries around the city. The tombs located at the church of Holy Apostles are known only from lists in literary sources, one of which is contained in De Ceremoniis. Although the sarcophagi of the emperors were broken into by Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, some of the oldest porphyry sarcophagi have survived: two in the atrium of the Hagia Eirene, four outside the Archaeological Museum, and a fragment of a fifth in the museum's \\"Istanbul through the Ages\\" pavilion, which is believed to be from that of Constantine I. Among those buried there were the following: *Constantine I (337) *Constantius II (361) *Julian the Apostate (363) *Jovian (364) and his wife Charito *Valentinian I (375) and his wife Marina Severa *Theodosius I (395) *Marcian (457) and Pulcheria (453) *Ariadne (515) *Anastasius I (518) *Justinian I (565), Theodora (548) *Ino Anastasia (593) *Heraclius (641) *Eudokia (612) *Fausta (668) *Anastasia (711) *Anastasios II (719) *Eudokia *Irene of Athens (803) *Leo VI the Wise (912) and his three wives (Theophano Martiniake (893), Zoe Zaoutzaina (899), Eudokia Ba√Øana (901)) *Eudokia Ingerina (882) *Nikephoros II (969) *Zoe Porphyrogenita (1050) *Theodora (1056) The bodies of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople and Patriarch Cyriacus II of Constantinople were also buried there.

In 2008, Iranian Arabs comprised about 2 percent of Iran's population, or about 1.6 million people, mostly in Khuzestan province.Plan of \\"study and measure the indicators of the country's public culture\\" (non-fixed indicators); Overview For centuries, Iranian rulers maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states such as those of Iraq and Yemen, and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. The Arab expedition to Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued with joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al- madar) and desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar). According to the Minorities at Risk Project 2001, about 40 percent of Arabs are unskilled workers living in urban areas. The Arabs in the rural areas are primarily farmers and fishermen. The Arabs living along the Persian Gulf coastal plains are mostly pastoral nomads. Tribal loyalties are strong among rural Arabs, but also have an influence in urban areas, impacting Arab socialisation and politicisation.Iran Overview from British Home Office In 2008, Payame Noor University made Arabic the second language of its 229 campuses and that its services would be offered in Arabic and Persian.ÿ±ÿßÿØ€åŸà ÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜŸá  ÿÆÿ®ÿ± ÿßŸàŸÑ  ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ  ÿπÿ±ÿ®€å ÿØŸàŸÖ€åŸÜ ÿ≤ÿ®ÿßŸÜ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥⁄ØÿßŸá Ÿæ€åÿßŸÖ ŸÜŸàÿ± ÿ¥ÿØ History Shapur II the Great (309‚Äì379 A.D.) of the Sassanid Empire, after a punitive expedition across the Persian Gulf early in his reign, transplanted several clans of the Taghleb to DƒÅrzƒ´n (Daharzƒ´n) near Bam, several clans of the Abd al-Qays and Tamƒ´m to Ha«∞ar (the K≈´h-e HazƒÅr region) southeast of KermƒÅn, several clans of the Bakr ben WƒÅ æel to KermƒÅn, and several clans of the Hanzala to Tavvaz, near present-day DƒÅlakƒ´ in FƒÅrs. Although after the Arab conquest of the Sassanid Persian empire in the 7th century, many Arab tribes settled in different parts of Iran, it is the Arab tribes of Khuzestan that have retained their identity in language, culture, and Shia Islam to the present day. But ethno-linguistic characteristics of the region must be studied against the long and turbulent history of the province, with its own local language khuzi, which may have been of Elamite origin and which gradually disappeared in the early medieval period. The immigration of Arab tribes from outside the province was also a long-term process. There was a great influx of Arab-speaking immigrants into the province from the 16th to the 19th century, including the migration of the Banu Kaab and Banu Lam. There were attempts by the Iraqi regime during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì88) to generate Arab nationalism in the area but without any palpable success. =Genetics= Sampling NRY diversity, it was determined that the Y-DNA haplogroups F and J2 are carried at high frequency among the Iranian Arabs, accounting for more than half of Iranian Arab haplogroups.Nasidze, I., Quinque, D., Rahmani, M., Alemohamad, S. A. and Stoneking, M. (2008), \\"Close Genetic Relationship Between Semitic-speaking and Indo-European-speaking Groups in Iran.\\" Annals of Human Genetics, 72: 241‚Äì252. The high ratio of haplogroup F genetically relates Iranian Arabs to Eastern Mediterraneans and the people of the Barbary Coast. An elevated frequency of haplogroup J-M172 is typical of Near Eastern people and reflective of the genetic legacy of early agriculturalists in the Neolithic Near East c. 8000‚Äì4000 BCE.

Regional groups Provinces of Iran based on the population of Arabs, according to the survey carried out by Ministry of Culture, 2010. =Khuzestan= Most Iranian Arabs in Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province speak Arabic and Persian. The Arabic spoken in the province is Khuzestani Arabic, a Mesopotamian dialect shared by Arabs across the border in Iraq. From the immigrant Arab tribes of Khuzestan, the Banu Kaab at Dawraq, the later FallƒÅhƒ´ya and present-day Shadegan, and the MawlƒÅ æƒ´ at Hoveyzeh can be mentioned. The Bani Turuf tribe is settled in the Dasht e Azadegan (formerly Dasht-e Mƒ´shƒÅn) around the town of H≈´zagƒÅn (formerly Hoveyzeh), and consists of seven tribes, the SovƒÅrƒ´, MarzaƒÅ, Shorfa, Banƒ´ SƒÅleh, MarvƒÅn, QƒÅ·π≠e ø, and Sayyed Nemat. North of the lands of the  øAnƒÅfeja of the ƒÄl Katƒ´r, in the area called Mƒ´ƒÅnƒÅb, between the KƒÅr≈´n and Karkheh Rivers, dwell several Arab tribes, of which the best known are the Kaab (probably an offshoot of the Banƒ´ Ka øb of southern Khuzestan), the  øAbd al khƒÅnƒ´, the Mazraa, the Al B≈´ RƒÅwƒ´ya, and the SƒÅdƒÅt. These tribes gradually immigrated into Iran during and after the early years of the Qajar period. =Culture of Iranian Arabs in Khuzestan= Strong blood relation which is one of the peculiarities of Arab society, results in cooperation between Arabs in hardships as well as the intensification of internecines between tribes. Iranian Arabs are well known for hospitality too.Ghayyem, Abdonnabi, a sociological look into life and culture of Arabs of Khuzestan, National seasonal magazine, 217. =Iranian Arab Women's costumes= Women's scarves have various types including Aba that is a black Chador with long sleeves from which hands are only exposed from wrist. Another is called Asabe or a turban like scarf, and the quality of the used cloth denotes the social rank of the woman. Pooshie is a mask-like silk cloth that covers the face. Dresses are of different types too. Nefnef is a long loose dress and Thoub is a gauzy loose dress that is worn on the Nefnef. Ne'al and Kabkab or Karkab are two kinds of footwear.Yasini, Razieh, a cultural and sociological study on local costumes of Iranian women from Southern seaside, Woman in culture and art magazine. =Fars= Khamseh Arab nomads live in eastern Fars Province (From Lar and close surrounding areas to Khorrambid and Bavanat). Arabs that live in eastern Fars Province and Hormozgan mostly belong to the tribes of Banu Tamim, Banu Kaab and Banu Hammed. =Khorasan= Most Khorasani-Arabs belong to the tribes of Sheybani, Zangooyi, Mishmast, Khozaima and Azdi.

It is the second film to co-star Gere and Roberts, following Pretty Woman (1990). Plot Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) is a spirited and attractive young woman who has had a number of unsuccessful relationships. Maggie, nervous about being married, has left a trail of fianc√©s waiting for her at the altar on their wedding day. All of these were caught on tape, earning Maggie tabloid fame and the dubious nickname \\"The Runaway Bride.\\" Meanwhile, in New York, columnist Homer Eisenhower Graham or \\"Ike\\" (Richard Gere), writes an article about her that contains several factual errors, supplied to him by a man he meets in a bar who Ike later learns was one of Maggie's former fianc√©s. Ike is fired for not verifying his source, but is invited to write an in-depth article about Maggie in a bid to restore his reputation. He travels to Hale, Maryland, where he finds Maggie living with her family and on her fourth attempt to become married. The fourth groom-to-be, Bob Kelly (Christopher Meloni), is a local high school football coach who uses sports analogies to help Maggie with her concerns. He constantly makes references to Maggie \\"focusing\\" on the goal-line in reference to their pending nuptials. As Ike starts going around town to meet her friends, family, and former fianc√©s, Maggie becomes frustrated and feels he is getting the story wrong again. Ike begins to cooperate with Maggie on the story, Maggie being interested in getting him to publish the truth, and the two become closer to each other the more time they spend together. During his research for the story, Ike realizes that Maggie is adjusting her interests to mimic those of her fianc√©s in order to please them. This is signified most prominently by her choice of eggs, which changes with each fianc√©. At a pre-wedding celebration for her and Bob, Ike defends Maggie from the public mockery she starts receiving from her family and guests, and Maggie walks outside due to the embarrassment. Ike then confronts Maggie outside about his realization regarding her relationships. During the wedding rehearsal, Bob tries to quell Maggie's wedding anxieties by walking her down the aisle. Ike is standing in at the altar, playing the groom. After Bob gets her to the altar, Ike and Maggie share a passionate kiss and admit to each other their feelings. Bob is chagrined, becomes jealous and punches Ike in the face before he storms out of the church. In the aftermath, Ike proposes that he and Maggie get married since the wedding is arranged. At the altar, Maggie gets cold feet and flees. Ike pursues her but she hitches a ride away on a FedEx truck. Later, we see Ike living in New York and Maggie trying to discover herself, trying different types of eggs, and putting her lighting designs up for sale in New York. She shows up unexpectedly at Ike's apartment one night where he finds her making friends with his cat, Italics. Maggie then explains that she had been running because every other guy she was engaged to was only engaged to the idea she had created for them rather than the real her, but with Ike she ran because, even though he truly understood her, she didn't understand herself. She \\"turns in\\" her running shoes just before proposing to Ike. Ike hides his eyes, but she persists. The two are married in a private ceremony outside, on a hill, avoiding the big ceremonies that Maggie notes she never actually liked. In the end, they are shown riding away on horseback while everyone in Hale and New York (clued in via cell phone by Ike and Maggie's family) celebrates the fact that Maggie finally got married. A post credit scene shows Maggie and Ike playing in the snow signifying that the relationship is going strong well after the wedding.

Description A brown trumpetfish Aulostomus maculatus is closely related to cornetfish. This species can be a bit more than 36 inches (91.44 cm) long and have greatly elongated and compressed bodies, with a compressed head which has with small jaws at the front end of their long, tubular snouts. There is a distinct barbel on the chin positioned at the tip of at the lower jaw. The dorsal and anal fins are positioned posteriorally. The dorsal fin has 8-12 well-spaced and isolated spines in front of it and has 12 spines and 12-25 soft rays. The anal fin has 21-25 soft rays while the caudal fin is rounded. The most commonly encountered color of A. maculatus is mottled brown to reddish brown with irregular black or brown spots. They may also be blue-gray, bright yellow or green and this species has the ability to change its color to camouflage itself. The head and flanks have transverse silvery streaks and the base of the dorsal and anal fins have a black bar which is sometimes reduced to a spot. There may be one or two spots on the tail. A. maculatus grow to a maximum reported length of in total length, although is more common. Distribution Aulostomus maculatus is widespread throughout the tropical waters of western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Although the most southerly records may actually be of the related species, Aulostomus strigosus. Habitat and biology Trumpetfish is a largely piscivorous ambush predator which is known to hide among shoals of large herbivorous fish, shadowing the fish until it is close enough to a prey item to strike. It will also hang vertically among gorgonians or drift with the current, capturing any prey that swim underneath it by sucking them into the mouth which has elastic tissues to allow it to open as wide as the diameter of its body. The sudden opening of the mouth creates a vacuum which pulls prey into the mouth. Recorded prey include ocean surgeon (Acanthurus bahianus), blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), tomtate grunt (Haemulon aurolineatum), French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum), longspine squirrelfish (Holocentrus rufus), downy blenny (Labrisomus kalisherae), dusky blenny (Malacoctenus gilli), redlip blenny (Ophioblennius atlanticus), rusty reefgoby (Priolepis hipoliti), spotted goatfish (Pseudupeneus maculatus), reef squirrelfish (Sargocentron coruscum), yellowtip damselfish (Stegastes pictus), and Bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum). Shrimp will also be taken. Stegastes planifrons often aggressively attack trumpetfish but these attacks do not appear to disrupt the trumpetfish's hunting. Normally solitary hunters, trumpetfish frequently associate with schools of striped parrotfish (Scarus iseri) to avoid attacks from S. planifrons and in these circumstances they have higher feeding rates than solitary fish. Trumpetfish at Molasses Reef, Florida Keys Human use Aulostomus maculatus is probably a minor part of the aquarium trade. It is often caught in seines and traps by fisheries, to which it is of minor commercial interest. Conservation The global decline of coral reefs and seagrass beds, and especially those occurring in the Caribbean is a threat to this species, as is predation by invasive lionfish, Pterois volitans and P. miles which prey on smaller specimens. There are no species-specific conservation measures, but its distribution overlaps a number of marine protected areas. Despite the declines in coral reef and seagrass beds habitats this species is resilient and is able to use other habitats such as rocky reefs which combined with its wide geographic range mean that it is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN.

Flynn was an accomplished Irish American athlete, an Olympic silver medalist and a war veteran. Family and early life Flynn on vacation with his wife Florence Patrick J. Flynn was born on 17 December 1894 in County Cork, Ireland. He was the eldest child of farmers Patrick and Ellen Flynn, and had three brothers and one sister. According to the 1901 census the Flynn family were living in Knocknagappue but they had moved to Cloghane in Kildara, Ballinadee by 1911. In his early years Flynn showed enormous talent under the tutelage of local athlete Bob Hales, and began competing in athletics in 1912. The following year was an eventful one for 19-year-old Flynn. That May he became an Irish champion after winning the Irish Four Mile Championship, and he represented Ireland in an international championship against Scotland in July. His success in the Four Mile category helped Ireland secure the championship title that year. Emigration to the USA In the autumn of 1913 Flynn emigrated to America from Queenstown (Cobh) in Cork. In New York City he soon found work as a shipping clerk and unsurprisingly began competing in athletics. In 1916 he joined the Paulist Athletic Club, which is a member of the Irish American Athletic Club. It was during this time that he came up against Olympic Champion Hans Kolehmainen in the 5,000 metres where he was beaten by less than a yard. This race, despite Flynn's defeat, is noteworthy as the winning time was to set a new world record of 14:33:6. During the next two years Flynn raced for the Irish American AC against the best in America, and was unbeaten. If not for the intervention of World War One, he would have certainly been selected to represent the USA in the 1916 Olympic Games, which would have taken place in Berlin. Flynn running in New York World War I Following the outbreak of the war, Flynn shelved his dreams of an Olympic medal and enlisted in the 165th Infantry Regiment in the spring of 1916; he would become a Sergeant. In July 1918 whilst fighting the Germans in France he was shot in his left arm during an act of heroism: When news of Flynn's injury made it back to the US, The New York Times published a short article about him. That August, he was awarded a Purple Heart for his bravery. The Great War ended in November 1918 and four months later the 165th arrived in New York. No regiment saw more action ‚Äî 180 days of combat ‚Äî with 644 killed and nearly 2,900 wounded. They were greeted as returning heroes and honoured with a parade up Fifth Avenue. 1920 Antwerp Olympics Flynn recovered from his injury and returned to athletics the following year. His coach at the Paulist Athletics Club persuaded him to try the steeplechase rather than his beloved long distance. Soon afterwards he came second in the two mile steeplechase (3,200m) to defending champion Michael Devaney. While trying out for the US Olympic Team in 1920, he won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) title and set a new US record of 9:58.2 for the 3000 m steeplechase. Unsurprisingly he qualified for the US Olympic team bound for Belgium in both the 5,000m and 10,000m. He was also entered in the 3,000m steeplechase, an event at which he was still a novice. The 1920 Antwerp Olympics were the first games to include the 3,000m steeplechase, which was run on a grass course just inside the cinder track. 3,000m steeplechase, 1920 Olympics, Antwerp Flynn won his qualifying heat comfortably, but the final didn't go as smoothly. He fell at one of the water jumps and was beaten to the tape by the favourite Percy Hodge (GBR); Flynn won the silver medal. There is little doubt that he would have been in contention for the gold had he not fallen. He also competed in the men's cross-country, individual; and men's cross-country, team, placing 9th and 4th respectively. 3,000m steeplechase, 1920 Olympics, Antwerp Later years Flynn continued to run following his return from Antwerp, but appears to have retired from competitive running after 1925. He married Florence in 1924. According to the 1930 census they lived in the Upper West Side Manhattan in close proximity to US Customs, where Flynn's last known employment was as a customs clerk. At the age of 47 he applied for service in World War II, but his application was refused. It is unknown how he lived out his final years. Patsy Flynn died on 5 January 1969 at the age of 74. He is buried in Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York alongside his wife Florence. Flynn's headstone in Long Island Cemetery Celebrating his memory Though his athletic accomplishments occurred nearly a century ago, Flynn's home town of Ballinadee in West Cork has not forgotten him and continues to celebrate his memory. In 1998 the local community and his relatives erected a monument in the quaint village which was opened by his surviving niece Ellen Hunt. Eire vs Scotland international medal Flynn's achievements were acknowledged again on 7 June 2015 in the inaugural Knocknacurra 7 Mile Road Race organised by Kilmacsimon Swimming and Rowing Club. This memorable occasion celebrated the achievements of three local athletes of the Knocknacurra townland who had international success: Patsy O'Flynn, Bob Hales (national and international athlete 1911-1912 and Flynn's early mentor) and Bill Nolan (Ireland v Scotland International 1 Mile Champion 1931). A number of Flynn's descendants competed in this memorial race, ensuring that his legacy lives on in future generations.

Plot introduction The Imperial Order continues to bring an undesired war upon the New World. Its mission is to enslave the world in a system in which no human being can aspire to anything more than mediocrity. Meanwhile, Richard, Cara and Kahlan return to Westland. Richard believes that if he leads the armies of the New World directly into a confrontation with the armies of the Imperial Order, he will lose the battle and the New World will fall prey to the grasp of death and slavery. Kahlan is nursed back to health after a brutal beating she received at the hands of Anderith's messengers at the end of the last book, Soul of the Fire. Just as she achieves her recovery, Nicci, a long time slave of Jagang and the Imperial Order, arrives to take Richard away. Kahlan and Cara pack their things and decide to return to the D'Haran armies. There they, too, will battle with the Imperial Order. Plot summary Faith of the Fallen begins where Soul of the Fire leaves off. Richard is taking Cara and injured Kahlan to the high mountains of his homeland, Westland. At the end of the Soul of the Fire Richard realizes that he cannot win against Emperor Jagang until the people themselves want to fight for freedom. Because of this mindset Richard isolates himself in the woods, to allow Kahlan time to heal, and refuses to give orders to the D'Haran army. After Kahlan has made a significant recovery, Nicci arrives and captures Kahlan by using a maternity spell, linking herself to Kahlan and enabling herself to kill Kahlan at any time. Richard is forced to go with Nicci into the Old World, leaving Kahlan, Cara, and the Sword of Truth to rejoin the D'Haran army. Shortly afterward, Prelate Ann and the reformed Sister of the Dark Alessandra visit the camp, looking for Richard, claiming his need for the people to prove their worth is pointless and that the prophecy dictates his required actions. This enrages Kahlan, and she threatens to murder Alessandra unless Ann destroys her journey book, which will prevent her from coordinating with Verna and the D'haran army. Kahlan and Cara, despite knowing Richard's objections, leave the Upper Ven in search of help from Zedd and Sister Verna. Seeing the plight of her troops fighting against the Order, Kahlan takes command of the combined armies of D'Hara and the Midlands in a desperate attempt to halt the Order's advance into the New World. Following Nicci, Richard is put to work in the Old World capital of Altur'Rang, finding work as a delivery man of steel and timber for construction, as Nicci's only requirement is that he care for her and himself, expecting the conditions of life among the poor will crush Richard's spirits. Richard also meets Brother Narev, a sorcerer who is constructing a spellform for the Imperial Palace that will effectively make Emperor Jagang immortal. As Richard becomes successful and relatively happy, even turning around the deplorable conditions of the neighborhood despite the conditions, Nicci begins to doubt her position, and finds she is viciously hated by her neighbors for her treatment of Richard. She attempts to seduce Richard but fails, and gives herself to a local thug, Gadi, who brutally assaults her, thinking that Kahlan will believe Richard finally fell for her charms. Richard is approached to lead a peaceful protest against the Order but he refuses and begs his friends to stay away, knowing it will be a wholesale slaughter. Hundreds are killed, and hundreds more are hung and tortured. Richard is eventually turned in by Gadi as a collaborator. Nicci spends a fortune in gold she finds Richard has hidden to set him free, finding he has been severely beaten. Richard, as punishment for his \\"civil infraction,\\" is commanded to erect a disgusting sculpture glorifying human suffering for the center of the New Palace. Secretly, Richard works tirelessly to create his own statue of a noble man and woman out of a block of flawed marble he purchases from a local quarryman. It is of such beauty that a huge procession is led through the city to view it. Brother Narev, when he finally arrives to see the statue, orders Richard to destroy it. Richard takes up the hammer and points to the crowd, telling them that the Order only wishes to destroy beauty, only wishes to enslave humanity under the doctrine of faith unsupported by the true value of life. He swings the hammer and shatters the statue in one blast. The people are outraged, and immediately revolt, proclaiming that the Order will not enslave them any longer. They attack the Imperial Order, and Altur'Rang falls to the hands of the rebels. Richard finds a group of his friends overseeing the execution of the Order governing council. After fighting many battles against the Imperial Order, overseeing the wedding of Verna to the Wizard Warren, the subsequent death of Warren at the hands of Gadi, Kahlan and Cara leave to find Richard, learning from Gadi's interrogation that he is in Altur'Rang. They enter Altur'Rang in time to see the statues destruction. As the rebellion begins, Richard enters the palace to find Brother Narev. While working his way through the dark corridors, he encounters Kahlan, the Sword of Truth over her shoulder. He attacks her and engineers the fight so that Kahlan runs him through. This forces Nicci to choose - to sever the maternity spell and save him or let him die and continue serving the Order. Nicci, wholeheartedly converted to Richard's cause after seeing his sculpture, removes the maternity bond to Kahlan and heals Richard. Altur'Rang is free, for a time, from the grasp of the Order, and the people have found a determination not to serve the system as slaves. The epilogue ends with Kahlan shyly staring at a massive statue of Spirit, a model Richard had carved with her face, being erected in the center of the newly free Altur'Rang Main characters Wizard's Sixth Rule In Faith of the Fallen, the Wizard's Sixth Rule is revealed to be: It is explained in the novel as follows: \\"The Sixth Rule is the hub upon which all rules turn. It is not only the most important rule, but the simplest. Nonetheless, it is the one most often ignored and violated, and by far the most despised. It must be wielded in spite of the ceaseless, howling protests of the wicked. Misery, iniquity, and utter destruction lurk in the shadows outside its full light, where half-truths snare the faithful disciples, the deeply feeling believers, the selfless followers. Faith and feelings are the warm marrow of evil. Unlike reason, faith and feelings provide no boundary to limit any delusion, any whim. They are a virulent poison, giving the numbing illusion of moral sanction to every depravity ever hatched. Faith and feelings are the darkness to reason‚Äôs light. Reason is the very substance of truth itself. The glory that is life is wholly embraced through reason, through this rule. In rejecting it, in rejecting reason, one embraces death.\\" References External links * Official Terry Goodkind website Category:2000 American novels Category:2000 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:The Sword of Truth books Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Faith of the Fallen"},{"id":"1908764","text":"Santiago Creole is the name given to the Cape Verdean Creole spoken mainly on Santiago Island of Cape Verde.

Thus Henry Brandon was nephew to King Henry VIII. His older sisters were Lady Frances Brandon and Lady Eleanor Brandon.Burke's Peerage He and his older brother (1516‚Äì1522Perry, Maria: The Sisters of Henry VIII: The Tumultuous Lives of Margaret of Scotland and Mary of France, Da Capo Press Edition, 2000, p. 154.) are often mistakenly thought to be the same person, because both died as children and bore the same name. It was not unusual in Tudor times to name a child after a deceased sibling.  Earl of Lincoln  Brandon was created Earl of Lincoln by Henry VIII on 18 June 1525 at the age of only two. \\"...the lorde Henry Brandon, sonne to the duke of Suffolke and the Frenche Quene the kynges sister, a childe of twoo yere old, was greated Erle of Lincolne...\\" In: Hall's chronicle: containing the history of England, during the reign of Henry the Fourth, and the succeeding monarchs, to the end of the reign of Henry the Eighth, in which are particularly described the manners and customs of those periods.

At the time of his birth, Mary was Henry VIII's only child, and the king's wife, Catherine of Aragon, was already past the age of thirty and had little prospect of having any more children. Next in line after the king's children was his sister Margaret Tudor, and her children, but their place in the succession was not secure ‚Äì Henry would later exclude them by the Second Succession Act (1536), and by his will. Next in line after that came the Duchess of Suffolk and her son Henry Brandon, who during his own lifetime (he died before Henry's son Edward was born), was the only person in the line of succession who had the twin qualifications of being male, and English. However, he died at the age of ten or eleven, in Southwark. Brandon's mother predeceased him, and his own death created royal ambitions in his sister Frances. After the death of the Duchess of Suffolk, the Duke married Catherine Willoughby himself. Though his son was betrothed to her, at ten he was too young for marriage and also sickly. \\"On Sunday next the duke of Suffolk will be married to the daughter of a Spanish lady named lady Willoughby. She was promised to his son, but he is only ten years old...\\" Imperial Ambassador Eustace Chapuys to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor In: 'Henry VIII: September 1533, 1‚Äì10', Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Volume 6: 1533 (1882)\\"...Lincoln was sickly [...] and Suffolk did not wish to gamble on his son's survival and risk losing Catherine's lands.

He served as a Liberal Member of Parliament representing Kitchener, Ontario from 1974 until 1979. His younger brother Dennis Flynn (birth name was Denis Christopher O'Flynn) was also active in Canadian politics serving as the Mayor of Etobicoke, Ontario and Chair of Metropolitan Toronto. Flynn was born Patrick Joseph \\"Joe\\" O'Flynn in Rathcormac, County Cork, Ireland on September 8, 1921. He and Denis, along with their parents, John Joseph O'Flynn and Molly O'Flynn (n√©e Mary Cahill) immigrated to Canada in 1925 on board the CP Ship Melita. Evidently the family dropped the \\"O'\\", and became known simply as Flynn. First arriving in Quebec City, they traveled by train to Toronto where they settled. Joe attended St. Helen's Catholic School and Bloor Street Collegiate in Toronto. In 1938 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy. He served as a Chief Petty Officer on HMCS Halifax (K237) during World War II. Joe and Dennis had three siblings, all born in Toronto: #Eileen Natale - whose husband Eugene (now deceased) started Tuxedo Junction in Toronto and then Eugene Natale, Men's Clothier, which was managed by Eileen. #Mary Ross - who worked for the municipal government of the City of Toronto; her husband, Ron (deceased), was a high school teacher. #John Joseph Flynn Jr. - John married Joselyn Leise, an elementary school teacher, and John is a Senior Teaching Fellow with the Canada School of Public Service (for the Canadian government). On March 18, 1944 he married Norma Jean (Betty) Brown, at St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church in Toronto. Upon his discharge from the RCN in 1945, Mr. Flynn accepted a position within the radiology department of St. Joseph's Hospital in Toronto. In 1948 he accepted a new position at K-W Hospital in Kitchener, Ontario. Mr. Flynn left the hospital to pursue a career in sales and successfully represented companies such as Merrel, Alberta Distillers, and Hiram Walker. In the late 1960s, Mr. Flynn was elected to the Kitchener Separate School Board and later went on to become Chair of the Waterloo County Catholic School Board. Joe and Betty Flynn had nine children, three of which were born in Toronto (Pat, Michael & Maureen) and the remainder were born in Kitchener (K.C., Larry, Mary Geraldine, Terry, Cathy & Sean). Tragically two of their children died at very young ages (Mary Geraldine 1958-1958 and Cathaleen Mavourneen 1963-1969). They resided in the \\"North Ward\\" area of Kitchener from 1948-1979. During his early days in Kitchener, Joe was an active member of the local Catholic community in Kitchener and was instrumental in the founding and building of St. Teresa Catholic Church. In early 1974 he won the nomination of the Kitchener Center Liberal Party to run as their candidate for Member of Parliament in the July 8th general election. He soundly defeated Progressive Conservative candidate, Mr. Barney Lawrence by more than 5,000 votes. During his term in the House of Commons, Mr. Flynn went on to serve on a number of House committees rising to Chair the Veterans Affairs Committee. In September 1978 he suffered a near-fatal aortic aneurysm while a patient in the National Defence Medical Centre in Ottawa. In May 1979 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau recommended to the Governor General Ed Schreyer that he be appointed to the Canadian Pension Commission for a 10-year period. Due to health reasons, Mr. Flynn retired from the Commission in 1983 and returned to Kitchener for his retirement. Joe and Betty Flynn resided in the Doon area of Kitchener from 1983 until his death in 1996. His wife Betty died at the age of 91 in 2013. On 26 March 2016, his second oldest son, Michael Denis (b. 31 July 1946) died of lung cancer. His remaining six (6) children all reside in Ontario.

Its population was 4,979 at the 2016 census. It is also an ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly, and is in the historical barony of Clanwilliam. The town gave its name to County Tipperary. History In Irish, \\"Tiobraid √Årann\\" means \\"The Well of Ara\\"‚Äîa reference to the River Ara that flows through the town. The well is located in the townland of Glenbane, which is in the parish of Lattin and Cullen. This is where the River Ara rises. Little is known of the historical significance of the well. The town had a medieval foundation and became a population centre in the early 13th century. Its ancient fortifications have disappeared, often dismantled to be reused in new buildings. Its central area is characterized by a wide streets radiating from the principal thoroughfare of Main Street. Two historical monuments are located in the Main Street. One is a bronze statue of Charles Kickham (poet and patriot). The other is the Maid of Erin statue, erected to commemorate the Irish patriots, Allen, Larkin and O'Brien, who are collectively known as the Manchester Martyrs. The Maid of Erin is a freestanding monument; erected in 1907, it was relocated to a corner site on the main street in 2003. It is made of carved limestone. A woman stands on a base depicting the portraits of the three executed men. The portraits carry the names in Irish of each man. She is situated on stone- flagged pavement behind wrought-iron railings, with an information board. This memorial to the Manchester Martyrs is a landmark piece of sculpture now located in a prominent corner site. The choice of a female figure as the personification of Ireland for such a memorial was common at the time. It is a naturalistic and evocative piece of work, made all the more striking by the lifelike portraits of the executed men. The first engagement of the Irish War of Independence took place at nearby Solloghead Beg Quarry on 21 January 1919 when Dan Breen and Se√°n Treacy led a group of volunteers in an attack on members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were transporting gelignite. The town was the site of a large military barracks of the British Army in the 50 years before Irish Independence and served as a military hospital during World War I. During the War of Independence, these barracks were a base for the Black and Tans. On 30 September 2005, Mary McAleese, President of Ireland, in a gesture of reconciliation, unveiled the newly refurbished Memorial Arch of the barracks in the presence of several ambassadors and foreign emissaries, military attach√©s and town dignitaries; a detachment of the Local Defence Force, the Number 1 Irish Army Band and various ex-service organisations paraded. In a rare appearance, the Royal Munster Fusiliers banner was carried to mark the occasion. However, given the notoriety of the place in the folk memory, few townspeople attended. The Arch is the only remaining porch of what was the officers' mess and has panels mounted bearing the names of fallen members of the Irish Defence Forces (on United Nations service), and American, Australian, and United Kingdom armed services. The Arch was renovated and maintained by the Tipperary Remembrance Trust. = New Tipperary = In 1888‚Äì89, tenants of the local landlord, Arthur Smith Barry, withheld their rents in solidarity with his tenants in County Cork. They were evicted. Led by Fr. David HumphreysDenis G. Marnane, \\"Fr David Humphreys and New Tipperary\\", Tipperary: History and Society, , 1985, pp. 367‚Äì78\\"Tipperary Historic Town Trail is launched\\", The Nationalist, 13 October 2010 and William O'Brien, they decided to build a new town on land outside Barry's control. The area now known Dillon Street and Emmet Street in Tipperary town was the centre of this development. It was built by local labour but with funds raised in Australia and the United States. The high point was 12 April 1890, when a row of shops called the William O'Brien Arcade was opened, providing shops for some of the business people who had been evicted from the centre of the town. Eventually, compromise was reached, and the tenants returned to the 'Old Tipperary'.  Transportation = Roads = The town is situated on the N24 route between Limerick city and Waterford city. = Railway access = Tipperary railway station is on the Limerick to Waterford line and has two services a day to Waterford via Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick on Suir. Two trains a day also operate to Limerick Junction which has numerous services to Cork, Dublin Heuston and Limerick and onward connections to Ennis, Athenry and Galway. There is no train service to/from Tipperary on Sundays. Tipperary railway station opened 9 May 1848. Amenities It is home to Tipperary Racecourse, which is located at Limerick Junction. It has a large agricultural catchment area in west Tipperary and east County Limerick and was historically a significant market town. Today, it still boasts large butter making and milk processing industries. The town is sometimes erroneously believed to be the county seat; this honour belongs instead to Clonmel.

The horizontally scrolling shooter is similar to the Atari 2600 game The Empire Strikes Back (1982), with AT-AT walkers replaced by giant camels.https://llamasoftarchive.org/8bitgames/attack-of-the-mutant-camels/ Confusingly, a very different game from Jeff Minter's Gridrunner series was also released in the US under the name Attack of the Mutant Camels. Llamasoft released a sequel, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, in 1984. Gameplay The player controls a small jet plane and has the task of killing giant yellow camels before they reach the home base. Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouths. If a camel reaches the base, the game is lost. Once all camels on a level are killed, the player has to survive a \\"hyperspace\\" sequence which requires avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presents a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay. Legacy In 2011, Attack of the Mutant Camels was chosen to be featured in the Smithsonian Institution's \\"The Art of Video Games\\" exhibit.

At first, Symphony OS was based on Knoppix. Since its May 2006 release it is no longer based on Knoppix, but rather on Debian unstable, and features a functional hard drive installer. Symphony OS 2007 Preview, was based on Ubuntu 7.04.Symphony OS 2007 Preview SymphonyOne was released on April 1, 2008. The release of version 2008.1 is based on Ubuntu 7.10. The primary difference between Symphony OS and other distributions is the addition of the Mezzo desktop environment. This environment, like other aspects of Symphony, was designed with an eye towards extreme simplicity and usability. An example is that WLAN-Networks can work automatically with no user action. Symphony also includes its own Mozilla-driven application environment, called Orchestra. Symphony OS uses a custom packaging system utilizing the \`*.sym\` package format; through a simple GUI a user may install any application in the Symphony library without dealing with \\"dependency hell\\". Because Symphony is Debian-based, it also supports the Debian package format. Orchestra Orchestra is a rapid application development environment which was being written for Symphony OS. It allows programs composed of HTML and CGI-style Perl to run as local GUI applications. Orchestra is made up of two main parts: a lightweight localhost-only HTTP server written in Perl, and a slimmed down Mozilla renderer. Because Mozilla is used as the base for rendering Orchestra, applications can utilize the following technologies: *Plain HTML *JavaScript *Perl and CGI *Java applets (using a plugin) *Macromedia Flash applications (using a plugin) *Embedded media players (using a plugin) *XUL interfaces Mezzo Mezzo is the desktop environment created by Ryan Quinn based on designs by Jason Spisak. Added to Symphony OS, it aims to pose a new way of presenting data to the user. Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like \\"The desktop is a folder\\" and nested menu systems and instead presents all needed information directly to the user via the main desktop and four desk targets for tasks and files related to System, Programs, Files, and Trash.

Geography  The Uitkoms Waterfall in the Bank Spruit, a tributary in the upper reaches of the Komati, Mpumalanga The river originates west of Carolina, rising at an elevation of about near Breyten in the Ermelo district of the Mpumalanga province.\\"Komati River\\" Online Encyclop√¶dia Britannica It flows in a general northeasterly direction and reaches the Indian Ocean at Maputo Bay, after a course of some . The Komati Gorge is situated in the upper reaches of the Komati River and is the habitat of some endangered species such as the southern bald ibis.C. Michael Hogan and Amy Gregory, Ecology of Komati Gorge, July 22, 2006 In 2001 the 115 m high wall of the Maguga Dam was completed south of Piggs Peak, Eswatini, . In its upper valley near Steynsdorp are goldfields, but the reefs consist almost entirely of low grade ore. The river descends the Drakensberg by a pass south of Barberton, and is deflected northward at the eastern border of Eswatinid, keeping a course parallel to the Lebombo mountains. Just west of 32¬∞ E and 25¬∞ 25‚Ä≤ S, near the town of Komatipoort, it is joined by the Crocodile River. The Crocodile tributary rises, as the Elands River, in the Bergendal (1,961 m) near the upper waters of the Komati, and flows eastwards across the highveld, being turned northward as it reaches the Drakensberg escarpment. The fall to the lowveld is over 600 metres in , and across the wide country between the Drakensberg and the Lebombo there is a further fall of 900 metres. Just over a kilometre below the junction of the Crocodile, the united stream, which from this point is also known as the Manhissa, passes to the coastal plain through a 190 m high cleft, high in the Lebombo known as Komatipoort, featuring some picturesque falls. At Komatipoort, which marks the border between South Africa and Mozambique, the river is less than from its mouth in a direct line, but in crossing the plain it makes a wide sweep of , first northwards before turning southwards, forming lagoon-like expanses and backwaters and receiving from the north several tributaries. In flood time there is a connection northward through the swamps with the basin of the Limpopo. The Komati enters the sea north of Maputo. It is navigable from its mouth, where the water is up to 5m deep, to the foot of the Lebombo.  History  The Portuguese named the river's lower reaches the Rio des Reijs, either \\"river of rice\\" or \\"river of kings\\". Subsequently, Jan van Riebeeck's journal mentions a Rio de Reijs, when he dispatched a ship up the east coast in search of rice supplies. In voortrekker Louis Tregardt's journal it is referred to as the Manhissa, a name still extant, while to the British it was known as the King George River. In 1725 a Dutch expedition led by Francois de Kuiper explored the region of the lower Komati and travelled 30 km into the current Mpumalanga province, before they were attacked by local tribes and had to return to Delagoa Bay. On the September 23, 1900 during the Second Boer War, 3,000 Boers crossed the frontier at the small town of Komati Poort, and surrendered to the Portuguese authorities. On November 7, 1900 the banks of the Komati became the site of a battle between the British Empire and the Boers. The Battle of Leliefontein was a retreat by the British, harassed by the Boers, who were threatening to capture the British Artillery. The British guns were saved by the Royal Canadian Dragoons who charged the Boers, whereby they placed the guns out of their reach.  Railway  The railway from Maputo to Pretoria traverses the plain in a direct line, and at seventy-two kilometres, reaches the Komati. It follows the south bank of the river and enters the high country at Komati Poort. From the Poort westward the railway skirts the south bank of the Crocodile River throughout its length. This railway was originally constructed by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) and was officially inaugurated in 1895.

The AV-1 is very similar to the 1976 AE-1 but provides aperture priority autoexposure rather than the AE-1's shutter speed priority AE. The camera is not capable of fully manual exposure. Canon's international distributors, particularly in the United States, had clamored for such a camera because competing brands offered mostly aperture-priority cameras and some preferred it. The AV in the name referred to the type of autoexposure; Av (Aperture Value) is a common abbreviation for aperture priority. When this camera appeared, a new range of FD lenses was introduced, with instant mounting/unmounting of the lens. This is called the New FD mount and does away with the older type of mounting ring which was fitted on to the rear of the lens and was awkward to use and needed two hands, to a newer, easier system whereby the user lined up the red dot on the lens, with the red dot on the camera and simply turned the whole lens clockwise until it clicked into place.

Member companies are the fabricators of fine finished woodwork, millwork, and furniture. AWI has published a Standard of Care for woodworking since 1961, called the Quality Standards Illustrated. The association is built on the idea of sharing knowledge in many forms ‚Äì formal programs, seminars and workshops, networking, committee involvement and publications. AWI and its members is devoted to fostering professionalism throughout the industry. Each member firm today garners prestige through the AWI logo, Quality Standards, Quality Certification Program, Design Solutions and other important technical publications. AWI Chapters are integral to networking opportunities, sharing of resources, and overall association operations. Chapters are the bedrock upon which the association operates. The chapter structure provides influence, information and a united front on local levels, bringing a common voice to the national organization on important industry issues. Chapters also provide the opportunity to conduct grassroots educational programs for woodworkers and the design community. They bring together woodworkers in a local area, giving them the opportunity to share ideas and information specific to their region. The AWI is not related to the Woodworkers Institute website in any way. History Since its beginning as the Millwork Cost Bureau, the Architectural Woodwork Institute has evolved into a respected organization. A small group gathered in Chicago on December 12, 1952 to determine if new life could be infused into the existing organization, or whether a new, more dynamic association should be formed to represent the expanding core of special millwork operators. Their first meeting set in motion a series of gatherings that would lead them down a new path. One month later, in January 1953, Charles Rinehimer, president of Rinehimer Bros. Mfg. Company, Elgin, Illinois, met with Ormie Lance, manager of the National Woodwork Manufacturers Association representing the 31 stock millwork plants in the United States. The conversation drifted in the direction of conducting a national meeting of custom millworkers, with the suggestion of running the idea past a trade association management firm. On October 15, 1953, Chairman Rinehimer welcomed 176 representatives of 109 architectural woodwork companies from the United States and Canada, 10 suppliers, representatives from 11 interested trade associations and 9 guest speakers to the opening session of a two-day convention at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. Concluding the discussions and the recommendation of the Development Committee, a motion was unanimously affirmed, creating the Architectural Woodwork Institute. After the convention adjourned, the newly elected directors met to select the first slate of officers: Rinehimer as president, Claude Twiellenmeier as first vice president, Charles Fischer as second vice president, William Otis as third vice president, and Elmer Root as treasurer. After the officers were selected, Robert Hoe, Jr., the director from Poughkeepsie, handed the new treasurer his company check for the first year‚Äôs dues, and the Architectural Woodwork Institute was on its way. Shortly thereafter, AWI was incorporated as a non- profit organization under the laws of the state of Illinois. Articles of Incorporation were recorded on December 17, 1954. Chairman Rinehimer helped to form regional chapters throughout the country. Membership in AWI increased as a result and a dual membership package for AWI and MCB was developed. Cost Book A was revised with plans set in motion to form an upgraded estimators correspondence course. AWI is a hands-on organization, governed by a member board, slate of officers and a set of bylaws. An industry association run by members, AWI programs and policies are developed and monitored by committees, and administered by an executive director and a national headquarters staff. Elected officers are the primary governing body of the organization. The president accepts the gavel for a one-year term following several years of service in board and vice president slots. In the late 1990s a management consulting group was enlisted to study the Institute‚Äôs governance structure. A member task force was appointed to work with the consulting team and together they studied and evaluated board design, nomination processes, committee structure and roles and responsibilities. At first the task force‚Äôs recommendations were rejected by the board, requiring further study and discussion, and then approved in the spring of 2001, reducing the size of the board to eleven members, eliminating the Executive Committee, and establishing a Development Council.

Since June 29, 2002, the only shareholder is a Slovak Company HTC Holding. The company manufactures farming tractors and tractor components (engines or transmissions). Zetor is the world's first manufacturer to develop and launch production of tractor safety cabins. In the 70-year-long history, Zetor has sold over 1.3 million tractors. Currently, Zetor portfolio includes six model ranges with power from 40 to 160 hp. Abroad, Zetor is represented through seven affiliations in North America, the UK, France, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and India. In 2015, 86% of total production of the company headed to foreign countries. In addition to traditional markets such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany, also to the UK, France, Ireland and Lithuania.  Name  The name Zetor, which was later to become the name of the brand and which was used by the state Company to mark the tractors, was created by Rostislav Sap√°k, a member of the Economic Department, in spring 1946. The name is formed of the syllable Zet (the spelling of the letter Z in the alphabet, the first letter of the name of the Arms Factory ‚ÄúZbrojovka‚Äù) and the suffix ‚Äìor from the word tractor. Or, respectively, from the word farming tractor, in Czech: ‚ÄúZEmƒõdƒõlsk√Ω trakTOR‚Äù (other cryptonyms for the name are also possible).  History  Zetor 25 A (1954-1961) Zetor 50 Super, 1963 The history of ZETOR starts in 1946 when the first tractor was produced in Zbrojovka Brno. It was labelled Zetor 25 and mass production of these machines was launched without a single obstacle. Mass production of ZETOR tractors started on 7 August 1946 and the ZETOR trademark was registered in the same year. By 1947 about 3400 had been produced. In 1948 it was approved for production Zetor 15, which was manufactured until 1949. Zetor 25A and 25K were manufactured until 1961 and produced was 158,570 pieces, of which 97,000 were exported. Zetor 35 with a 42-horsepower four-cylinder engine was manufactured in 1955-1960 and then as the upgraded version Zetor 50 until 1968. In 1952, ZETOR moved to a new location within Brno, L√≠≈°e≈à, where the tractors have been produced to this day. In the late 1950s, ZETOR was the first to introduce a progressive and unique concept of using unified parts to produce tractors worldwide. The Unified Series I (U≈ò I.) was launched, with the models 2011, 3011 and 4011, they had two, three and four-cylinder engines. In 1968, the Unified Series II (U≈ò II.) was presented; it included many innovative features of those times ‚Äì e.g. the first safety cabin with rollover protection system in the world, mounted on vibration isolators. The new cabin also helped to reduce noise in the cabin below 85 dB. Thanks to these innovative procedures, the ZETOR brand was globally acclaimed and topped the charts of global tractor manufacturers. Soon, in the 1970s, the first six-cylinder ZETOR CRYSTAL 12011 tractor was designed. In 1976, ZETOR became the name of both the brand and the company. The company continued to evolve and in 1991 the Unified Series III was launched; it underwent an innovation process at the turn of the millennium and received the ZETOR FORTERRA trade name. The Unified Series III (U≈ò III.) was launched in 1992, by models 7520, 7540, 8520, 8540, 9520, 9540 and 10540, with 82-103 horsepower, presented as 'Model 92'. In 1994 it was extended by the 7320 Turbo and 7340 Turbo models. In 1997, the production of models 3321 super-7341 super turbo was launched, presented as 'Model 97'. For the ZETOR brand, the turn of the millennium was a revolutionary period. The well- established Czech brand of farming machinery could have been subject to vanishing then since the state-owned enterprise faced bankruptcy. Around then, HTC Holding a.s. from Slovakia entered history and in June 2002, it became the owner of ZETOR. When the new owners came into the company, they invested money to stabilize it and, in turn, restructure it.  Current Models  Zetor produces six tractor model ranges: Zetor Utilix, Zetor Hortus, Zetor Major, Zetor Proxima, Zetor Forterra, and Zetor Crystal. Zetor Hortus Zetor Major Zetor Proxima Zetor Forterra Zetor Crystal = Utilix and Hortus = The new Utilix and Hortus lineups were introduced in the first quarter of 2018. New tractors are small and light, equipped with 4-cylinder engines with outputs of 43 to 67 hp. = Zetor Major = Zetor Major range was launched in the early 2002. It is a simple tractor with the power of 80 hp, which is appreciated for its reliability and low operation costs. In 2015, the Major range was extended by a new type Major 60 with the power of 61 hp. In the late 2016 the company launched new MAJOR HS, which offers higher comfort retaining low operation costs. Tractors of the Major range included in the medium power class are appreciated for easy operation and service. = Zetor Proxima = The Proxima range entered the market in 2004. It is a universal farming tractor employing four-cylinder engines of the ZETOR brand. They are used for aggregations with farming machines, industrial adaptors and in farming transport. They are mostly used in farming, forestry and community service. Zetor manufactures three types: Proxima CL, proxima GP, and Proxima HS, covering the powers from 80 to 120 hp and offering a high variability of transmissions. They offer creeping gears in the CL model, up to three-stage PowerShift or PowerShuttle. = Zetor Forterra = The Forterra range introduces robust tractors equipped with four-cylinder Zetor engines, which are suitable for heavy-duty work in farming and forestry. The first pieces entered the market in 2008. In 2012, the range was extended by Forterra HSX with 30/30 transmission and electro- hydraulic reverser. In 2014, the range was extended by Forterra HD with the power up to 147 hp and electronic hydraulic regulation. = Zetor Crystal = For a long-term period, Zetor has not produced a powerful six-cylinder tractor. Such a missing model was launched in 2015 when Zetor Crystal was presented. The name Crystal refers to the legendary tractors produced by Zetor from 1969 to the 1980s. In that period, over 45,000 Crystal tractors were sold. The new Crystal is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with the power from 144 or 163 hp. The engines are equipped with 24 valves and Common Rail injection. The transmission offers 30 forward and 30 reverse gears. The operation of the tractor is made easier by three-stage PowerShift, PowerShuttle and PowerClutch, the clutch button incorporated into the gear- shifting lever. = Marking of Zetor tractors = These markings of ZETOR tractors are used only for the Unified Series I, II. The Unified Series III uses new coding. The first or three numbers of the marking of the tractor mean the approximate power of the engine in hp, e.g. 72, 80, 121, 162, etc. The next two numbers mark powered axles, e.g. 7211 (Zetor with approximate power of 72 hp without front-wheel drive). -//-45 (Zetor with 4WD) -//-16 (Semi- caterpillar version) = Zetor by Pininfarina = In 2015, at Agritechnica exhibition in Hannover, Zetor introduced the design concept ZETOR by Pininfarina. The concept shall be applied to all model ranges and products of the Zetor brand. BBC has said on the concept of the Italian Pininfarina studio, which supplies concepts for instance for Ferrari, that it is the most sexy tractor in the world ever.  Other Services  Zetor Gallery Engines and Components Zetor produces and sells also individual engines and tractor components. Four-cylinder Zetor engines meet the required emission standards including the currently strictest STAGE IV. To its customers it offers service and spare parts, which are supplied throughout the world. Zetor offer currently includes over 20,000 original parts for all types of ZETOR tractors ranging from Unified Series I, II, and III to current models. Thus, even tractors aged over 40 years have full service support. Zetor also produces original oils of the Zetor brand. Front loaders Zetor offers two ranges of front loader within the Zetor System. Front loaders marked ZL and ZX differ in size and lifting force whereas both are compatible with all current Zetor tractors. Zetor Gallery June 13, 2013, witnessed the ceremonial opening of the Zetor museum called Zetor Gallery. The museum displays tractors from the legendary Z 25 up to the most current Crystal model and the prototype of the future design tractors Zetor by Pininfarina. Part of the museum is also a fan shop. Notes a. The 'birth certificate' of the first Zetor tractor (Z25) is reportedly dated March 15, 1946, and the Zetor trademark reportedly registered by the Czechoslovakian Chamber of Commerce on August 15, 1946.

A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements. In information systems, the essential features that make a component composable are that it be: * self-contained (modular): it can be deployed independently ‚Äì note that it may cooperate with other components, but dependent components are replaceable *stateless: it treats each request as an independent transaction, unrelated to any previous request. Stateless is just one technique; managed state and transactional systems can also be composable, but with greater difficulty. It is widely believed that composable systems are more trustworthy than non-composable systems because it is easier to evaluate their individual parts.  Simulation theory  In simulation theory, current literature distinguishes between Composability of Models and Interoperability of Simulation. Modeling is understood as the purposeful abstraction of reality, resulting in the formal specification of a conceptualization and underlying assumptions and constraints. Modeling and simulation (M&S;) is in particular interested in models that are used to support the implementation of an executable version on a computer. The execution of a model over time is understood as the simulation. While modeling targets the conceptualization, simulation challenges mainly focus on implementation, in other words, modeling resides on the abstraction level, whereas simulation resides on the implementation level. Following the ideas derived from the Levels of Conceptual Interoperability model (LCIM), Composability addresses the model challenges on higher levels, interoperability deals with simulation implementation issues, and integratability with network questions. Tolk Tolk, A. Interoperability, Composability, and their Implications for Distributed Simulation - Towards Mathematical Foundations of Simulation Interoperability. Proceedings DS-RT 2013 Conference, Delft, The Netherlands, October 2013 proposes the following definitions: Interoperability allows exchanging information between the systems and using the information in the receiving system.

Established in 1908, it is the oldest in Asia. The league was formerly the highest division in Hong Kong until the formation of the Hong Kong Premier League in 2014. Since 1908, a total of 29 clubs have been crowned champions of the Hong Kong football system. South China are the most successful club, having won 41 times since their first participation in 1941.

The ticket profits go to the home team. If there are two matches in the same stadium on the day, the profits are shared between the two home teams. The top two teams in the league are offered promotion to the Premier League while the bottom two are relegated to the Hong Kong Second Division. =Exceptions= There were two teams, The Army and The Police, that are not required to be relegated. The league explained that soldiers in The Army team were frequently redeployed to another country and hence it was very difficult to establish teamwork. The Police team were not required to be relegated as they supply the venue Police Sports and Recreation Club for the league. Another relegation exception was made to South China Athletic Association during the 2006‚Äì07 season.

The reason for exception was not disclosed. The public believed that this application was allowed probably because South China has a long history in the First Division League and it would otherwise be humiliating for the club to be relegated to the Second Division. Another reason is that other football clubs rely on the large fan base of South China to generate revenues. Relegation would have resulted in a lose-lose situation for all sides.

The draw matches were against Kui Tan, Eastern and Caroline Hill. A more marvellous result for Seiko was that it won 5 out of the 6 competitions that season. The only trophy it failed to get was FA Cup, losing to Yuen Long by penalty kicks. * Happy Valley (1985‚Äì86) 1985‚Äì86 Happy Valley was unbeaten in the season, same as South China (10 wins and 8 draws). However, Happy Valley finished runners-up because a worse goal difference. It became the first unbeaten team which could not gain the title for the season. * Sun Hei (2002‚Äì03, 2016‚Äì17) 2002‚Äì03 Sun Hei became the fourth team to go the whole season without losing a game in the history of the league. However, they were only able to achieve a second-place finish, one point behind Happy Valley. 2016‚Äì17 Sun Hei were also the first team since the reformation of the First Division as the second tier of Hong Kong football to finish a season undefeated. They won the title in 2016-17 by one point over Wong Tai Sin. * HKFC (2017‚Äì18) 2017‚Äì18 HKFC won their first league title in nearly a century, going unbeaten over a 30 match season. =Top goal scorers= References: * Ho Cheung Yau () (Most goals in a season) :Season: 1957‚Äì58 :Number of goals: 40 :Team: South China * Dale Tempest (Most times winner for Top Goal Scorer prize) :Winning seasons: 1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91, 1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95 :Total goals: 160 :Played teams: Eastern, South China, Kitchee * Yuen Kuen To (4 times Top Goal Scorer runner-up) :Runner-up seasons: 1967‚Äì68, 1968‚Äì69, 1971‚Äì72, 1972‚Äì73 =Goalkeeper records= References:HKFA Webpage (in Chinese)(ËÅØË≥Ω‰∏çÂ§±ÁêÉÁ¥ÄÈåÑÁöÑ‰øùÊåÅËÄÖ‚îÄÂ∏åÁ¶èÁâπ) * Iain Hesford (Longest Clean Sheets) :Record: 827 min :Season: 1992‚Äì93 :He assisted Eastern to maintain a record of 0 conceded and 9 straight wins in the first 9 matches of 1992‚Äì93 season.

It comprises of landscaped gardens and parkland that once formed the grounds of Cardiff Castle. The park is named after the 3rd Marquess of Bute, whose family owned the castle. History and description The Castle Green was landscaped in the late eighteenth century by Capability Brown, but the park itself was laid out from 1873 on by Andrew Pettigrew, Head Gardener to the 3rd Marquess. The 5th Marquess of Bute presented the park to the Council in 1947 and the park is still owned and managed by Cardiff Council. Along the east bank of the River Taff and adjoining Cardiff Castle, the park offers a combination of arboretum, flower gardens and recreation grounds. Most of the park is laid to grassland but there is an abundance of woodland and tree-lined avenues. Sophia Gardens and Pontcanna Fields are on the opposite side of the river, reached by two footbridges. Sophia Gardens is home to the Glamorgan County Cricket Ground, where test matches are played, and to the Sport Wales National Centre. Within the park there are sculptures such as wood carvings formed from retained tree stumps (in 2012 a series of additional carvings were commissioned as part of the Restoration Project) which encourage natural play. An ironwork sundial, originally placed in the park in 1990 after a Festival of Iron event, was removed in 2006 and replaced by a small round formal garden to honour Stuttgart (Cardiff's German twin-town.) This feature was designed by the Parks Service in Stuttgart and planted by horticultural apprentices from both cities as part of a programme of exchange visits between the two parks departments. The dock feeder canal in Bute Park The dock feeder canal runs along the eastern edge of the park. Its origins go back to medieval times when it was a millstream, constructed to feed the Lord's Mill, situated below the western walls of Cardiff Castle. This line is clearly seen on the Bute Estate Maps of 1824.Bute Estate Maps of 1824 In 1833, the line of the mill stream was incorporated as a water source for the development of the Cardiff Docks by the 2nd Marquess of Bute and was reformed as the dock feeder when the docks were constructed 1836-1841.Plan showing the route of the dock feeder, 1833. Glamorgan Archives The dock feeder is still the main water supply to Cardiff Docks. RHS Show Cardiff has been held in Bute Park since 2005. Since 1981, the park has hosted what is now Sparks in the Park, an annual Guy Fawkes Night firework display, the profits from which are distributed to charity. This event is organised every year by Cardiff's local branch of Round Table. In 2010, Cooper's Field hosted a concert by Florence and the Machine. Bute Park Restoration Project From 2007 Cardiff Council undertook a ¬£5.6 million restoration project, which was part-funded by a ¬£3.1 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project provided new facilities and restored historic features in the park, including: * Summerhouse Kiosk providing refreshments and toilets, built in 2010 to a design that echos William Burges's summerhouse in the park. * Animal Wall, designed by William Burges (1827‚Äì1881), a stone wall topped by sculpted animal heads, cleaned and conserved in 2010. * Blackfriars Friary: Work undertaken to conserve and interpret the medieval Friary remains, using Victorian brickwork walls to mark the building's plan. * West Lodge: The restoration and extension of this historic building and gateway provides a visitor information/orientation point, now used as the Pettigrew Tea Rooms. * Mill Leat: Reintroduction of water to the old castle moat that runs alongside the original 12th-century mill stream will restore views and enhance the character of the park to the west of Cardiff Castle. * Bute Park Arboretum: Improved signage and interpretation will allow increased awareness and understanding of the park's nationally significant tree collection. * Education Centre: This new facility is discreetly located within Bute Park Nursery, and playing on the concept of a \\"secret garden\\", will be the hub of the park's public education programme.

He was son of Mindaugas, the first and only Christian King of Lithuania. Nothing is known about the youth of Vai≈°vilkas as he entered historical sources only in 1254 when he made a treaty, in the name of his father King Mindaugas, with Daniel of Halych-Volhynia. In the treaty, Halych-Volhynia transfers Black Ruthenia with center in Navahrudak to Lithuania. To solidify the treaty, Daniel's son Shvarn was married to Vai≈°vilkas' sister. Vai≈°vilkas was appointed as duke of some of these lands. After Vai≈°vilkas was baptized in a Greek Orthodox rite, he was drawn to religious life so much that he transferred his title and lands to Roman Danylovich, son of Daniel of Halych. He founded a monastery traditionally identified with Lavrashev Monastery on the bank on the Neman River and entered it as a monk. He set off on a pilgrimage to Mount Athos in Greece. However, he did not reach the destination due to wars in the Balkans and returned to Navahrudak. In 1264, he escaped an assassination plot by Treniota and Daumantas against his father and two of his brothers. Treniota was murdered by former servants of Mindaugas. Vai≈°vilkas allied himself with his brother-in- law Shvarn from Halych-Volhynia. They managed to take control over Black Ruthenia and the Duchy of Lithuania. Then they waged a war against Nal≈°ia and Deltuva, two main centers of opposition to Mindaugas and Vai≈°vilkas. Daumantas, Duke of Nal≈°ia, was forced to flee to Pskov. Suksƒó (Suxe), another influential duke from Nal≈°ia, fled to Livonia. Vai≈°vilkas became next the Grand Duke of Lithuania. As a Christian, he tried to maintain friendly relationships with the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order. He signed a peace treaty with Livonia regarding trade on the Daugava River. Lithuanian support of the Great Prussian Uprising ceased, and the orders made advances against Semigallians and Curonians uninterrupted. Together with Shvarn, Vai≈°vilkas attacked Poland in 1265 to avenge devastation of Yotvingians in 1264. When in 1267 he decided to go back to monastic life, Vai≈°vilkas transferred the title of Grand Duke to Shvarn. A year later he was killed by Shvarn's brother, Leo I of Halych, who was angry that Vai≈°vilkas did not divide the powers between him and his brother. He was interred near the Assumption Church in Volodymyr-Volynskyi. Name The original Lithuanian name of this Grand Duke has puzzled many linguists and historians. Their reconstructions resulted in two credible variants Vai≈°vilkas, based on Woyszwi≈Çk and Vai≈°elga, based on Voj≈°alk. The name Vai≈°vilkas was first reconstructed by Kazimieras B≈´ga. In fact, the first part of the double- stemmed name vai≈°- causes no dispute and is attested in many similar names. However, the second part -vilkas, meaning \\"wolf\\" is very rare to non existent in Lithuanian names. This led to the hypothesis that the initial form of the name should have been Vai≈°vilas. The variant Vai≈°elga/Vai≈°alga has gained more popularity in historical writings even though the origins of the element -alg and -elg are not entirely clear. Eventually, some researchers even suggest that he had two names, one of them being Vai≈°vilas.

It was Bu√±uel's final directorial effort before his death in July 1983. Set in Spain and France against the backdrop of a terrorist insurgency, the film conveys the story told through a series of flashbacks by an aging Frenchman, Mathieu (played by Fernando Rey), who recounts falling in love with a beautiful young Spanish woman, Conchita (played interchangeably by two actresses, Carole Bouquet and √Ångela Molina), who repeatedly frustrates his romantic and sexual desires. In recent years, the film has been highly acclaimed by critics. Plot A dysfunctional and sometimes violent romance happens between Mathieu (Fernando Rey), a middle-aged, wealthy Frenchman, and a young, impoverished, and beautiful flamenco dancer from Seville, Conchita, played by Carole Bouquet and √Ångela Molina. The two actresses each appear unpredictably in separate scenes, and differ not only physically, but temperamentally as well. Most of the film is a flashback recalled by Mathieu. The movie opens with Mathieu travelling by train from Seville to Paris. He is trying to distance himself from his young girlfriend Conchita. As Mathieu's train is ready to depart, he finds that a bruised and bandaged Conchita is pursuing him. From the train he pours a bucket of water over her head. He believes this will deter her, but she sneaks aboard. Mathieu's fellow compartment passengers witness his rude act. These include a mother and her young daughter, a judge who is coincidentally a friend of Mathieu's cousin, and a psychologist who is a dwarf. They inquire about his motivation for such an act, and he then explains the history of his tumultuous relationship with Conchita. The story is set against a backdrop of terrorist bombings and shootings by left-wing groups. Conchita, who claims to be 18 but looks older, has vowed to remain a virgin until marriage. She tantalizes Mathieu with sexual promises, but never allows him to satisfy his sexual desire. At one point she goes to bed with him wearing a tightly laced canvas corset, which he cannot untie, making it impossible to have sexual intercourse. Conchita's antics cause the couple to break up and reunite repeatedly, each time frustrating and confusing Mathieu. Eventually, Mathieu finds Conchita dancing nude for tourists in a Seville nightclub. At first he becomes enraged. Later, however, he forgives her and buys her a house. In a climactic scene, soon after moving into the house, Conchita refuses to let Mathieu in at the gate, tells him that she hates him, and that kissing and touching him make her sick. Then, to prove her independence, she appears to initiate sexual intercourse with a young man in plain view of Mathieu, although he walks away without witnessing the act. Later that night he is held up at gunpoint as his car is hijacked. After this, Conchita attempts to reconcile with Mathieu, insisting that the sex was fake and that her \\"lover\\" is in reality a homosexual friend. However, during her explanation, Mathieu beats her (she then says \\"Now I'm sure you love me\\"), causing her bandaged and bruised state seen earlier in the film. Just as the fellow train passengers seem satisfied with this story, Conchita reappears from hiding and dumps a bucket of water on Mathieu. However, the couple apparently reconcile yet again when the train reaches its destination. After leaving the train, they walk arm in arm, enjoying the streets of Madrid. Later in a mall in Paris, loudspeakers announce that a strange alliance of extremist groups intends to sow chaos and confusion in society through terrorist attacks. The announcement adds that several right- wing groups plan to counter-attack. As the couple continues their walk, they pass a seamstress in a shop window mending a bloody nightgown. They begin arguing just as a bomb explodes, apparently claiming their lives. Casting That Obscure Object of Desire is most notable for its use of two actresses, Carole Bouquet and √Ångela Molina, in the single role of Conchita; the actresses switch roles in alternate scenes and sometimes even in the middle of scenes. In his autobiography, My Last Sigh (1983), Bu√±uel explains (pp. 46‚Äì47) the decision to use two actresses to play Conchita: The book does not identify the actress who had caused the \\"tempestuous argument,\\" though Bu√±uel makes it clear (p. 250) that she was neither Carole Bouquet nor Angela Molina. In Luis Bu√±uel: The Complete Films (2005), editors Bill Krohn and Paul Duncan identify the actress as Maria Schneider, writing (pp. 177‚Äì78) the following in regard to the idea of using two actresses to play Conchita: Specifically regarding Bu√±uel's employment of two actresses to play a single character, most critics were charmed, as exemplified by then New York Times film critic Vincent Canby's review, \\"Conchita is so changeable that Bu√±uel has cast two lovely new actresses to play her‚ÄîCarole Bouquet, who looks a little like a young Rita Hayworth, as the coolly enigmatic Conchita, and Angela Molina as the earthy, flamenco-dancing Conchita [...] the Conchita who goes into the bathroom to change, changes not only her clothes. Miss Bouquet goes in but Miss Molina comes out. [...] Miss Bouquet and Miss Molina are enchanting ‚Äî I don't think Bu√±uel has ever before been so successful with neophyte actresses.\\" Other films that employ two or more actors to perform a single character include Todd Solondz's Palindromes, wherein eight different actors of different ages, races, and genders play a 13-year-old girl named Aviva during the course of the film; Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, where similarly a production issue - in this case the death of Heath Ledger during production - led to Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law stepping in to play his character's 'imaginary world' scenes; and Canadian filmmaker B. P. Paquette's Perspective, wherein each of the three lead actors continually rotate the three characters they play, not only within the same scene, but sometimes during the same dialogue exchange. Also of note is Spanish actor Fernando Rey who frequently worked with Bu√±uel in his later years. He plays Mathieu, but his voice is dubbed by the French actor Michel Piccoli. Responses The film was not financially successful, but it became a critical favorite, garnering Best Foreign Language Film nominations at both the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards (where it was also nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium) but failing to win at either. The critics associations were slightly more generous, with the National Board of Review and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association both giving it the Best Foreign Language Film awards in 1977. Luis Bu√±uel won Best Director at the National Board of Review and National Society of Film Critics awards. He was also nominated at the French C√©sar Awards. Many contemporary critics have declared the film a masterpiece. The film holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.96/10 among 29 critics. The site's consensus reads: \\"That Obscure Object of Desire is a frequently unsettling treatise on the quixotic nature of lust and love\\". In the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, three critics and two directors ranked it one of the ten greatest films ever made.

The mirror of a Canon AL-1, showing the etched gaps in the mirror coating that allow light to reach the phase-detection system. The Canon AL-1 was an FD mount, 35mm single-lens reflex camera introduced in March 1982. Its main feature was the \\"Quick Focus\\" focus-assist system that was aimed at those who had trouble focusing through the viewfinder--either novices, or those with poor eyesight--and was intended to head off competition from the first full-autofocus cameras from other manufacturers, such as the Pentax ME F. Features As a lower-end camera, the AL-1 did not offer a long list of features. Instead, Canon focused on providing core functionality and lowering price. The AL-1 provides focus- confirmation, aperture-priority autoexposure (controlled by a through-the-lens silicon photocell), and a small selection of manual shutter speeds, including 10 second self-timer. It also added a larger grip, and the convenience of using of AAA cells for power. However the battery door is one of its weakness as most of the cameras that are found today on the market have their battery door broken or that has been changed. Its body was constructed from a special polycarbonate that was then painted to imitate metal. An ISO hotshoe, motor- drive connections, and cable-release socket provide an acceptable level of compatibility with accessories. It was also the last SLR camera to carry Canon's 1960s-era logo on the pentaprism. The camera uses Canon's breech-lock FD mount, and so users could choose from the wide variety of Canon FD lenses, as well as those from third parties. Users could also utilise Canon R and FL lenses, but with some limitations. In 1987, Canon abandoned the FD mount in favour of the EF mount along with the EOS camera system, which uses the same concept as the T80 but with a new and incompatible mount designed around an all-electronic interface. Autofocus The AL-1 marked Canon's first public foray into autofocus technology. While far from a true autofocus system, the camera acted a test for Canon engineers to evaluate phase detection for SLR cameras. The QF focus-assist system uses traditional phase detection linear CCD arrays in the base of the camera. Light is diverted to these sensors through a partially silvered mirror. When the light of the subject is in phase, the image is in focus. Below the viewfinder image, two red arrows indicate which direction to turn the focusing ring to achieve focus. Optimum focus is indicated by a green light (circle) between the two arrows. Contrast detection is the system used for autofocus on most compact digital cameras in recent years. Due to the camera's lack of features, it was never overly popular and so it would be 1985 before Canon expanded on the concept, even though its competitors raced ahead. In 1983 Nikon introduced the F3AF, a special version of their pro-series F3, which used a special viewfinder with a built-in autofocus system connecting electronically to a motor in the lens. In 1985 Minolta introduced the Maxxum 7000 (Dynax 7000 in Europe and Asia), the world's first body-integrated autofocus SLR. Canon reacted to this with the T80, which integrated the focus system into the body and, as with the F3AF, connected electronically with a motor in the lens.

Cottenham is one of the larger villages surrounding the city of Cambridge, located around five miles north of the city. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 6095. Cottenham is one of a number of villages that make up the historical Fen Edge region in between Cambridge and Ely, which were originally settlements on the shore of the marshes close to the city of Cambridge, then an inland port. History Much of Cottenham parish lies on a lower greensand ridge around 8 metres above sea level, which until the 17th century draining of the Fens was the only dry land in between Cambridge and the Isle of Ely around 12 miles to the north-east of the village. The southern side of the parish lies on raised fertile red loam, and the original village settlement is believed to have started as a Roman British island community taking advantage of fertile pasture at the edge of the marshland in between Cambridge and Ely. The growth into a permanent medieval village is thought to have begun from a nucleus of houses defined by High Street, Rooks Street and Denmark Road, a suggestion supported by excavations off Denmark Road and High Street conducted by the University of Cambridge in 1997. The lowest part of the parish lies below 4.5 metres at Smithey Fen in the north of the village, with the remnants of excavated peat beds still present there. As part of an extensive fenland region, Cottenham is drained by a system of ditches and lodes which are believed to have been built or at least significantly expanded by the Romans. The northern regions of the parish drain into the Roman Car Dyke, a large drainage ditch which traverses the Fens in between the River Cam and the River Great Ouse, and the central village drains into Cottenham Lode, one of the many Cambridgeshire Lodes used to connect villages to the River Great Ouse as it travelled towards The Wash. The north-east of the parish is bounded by a section of the major Roman road, Akeman Street. The parish is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as housing 60 tenants, however the population fluctuated until the 13th century when the parish boundaries became somewhat fixed and pastures were enclosed. River transportation along the River Great Ouse which lies to the north of the parish was extremely important throughout the Middle Ages, establishing Cottenham as a trade route in between Cambridge and the surrounding Fens, resulting it becoming one of the largest villages in Cambridgeshire from the 11th century onwards. The primary road out of the village (now the B1049) travelled southwards to Histon and onwards to Cambridge. The main route into the Fens travelled north towards Wilburton, and was bisected by the River Great Ouse to the north of Cottenham. Access to Wilburton and Ely was via the Twenty Pence Ferry which crossed the River Great Ouse in between Setchel Fen and Chear Fen, now regions of farmland at the northernmost end of the parish. The ferry crossing was maintained until modern times when a floating toll bridge was opened in 1901, and then finally a County Council-built bridge across the Ouse was constructed in 1929. The majority of houses became clustered on either side of the 1.75 km-long High Street, the main road into the city of Cambridge, resulting in Cottenham becoming a long village surrounded by parish pastures, with the village church built at the north of the High Street and the village green to the extreme south of the village. The long High Street and subsequent elongated geography of the village has led to two distinctive communities, the \\"Church End\\" and \\"Green End\\". =Great Fire of Cottenham= Damage caused by the fire of 1850, seen from Lamb's Lane Corner Cottenham houses have a mix of architectural styles because few houses have survived the numerous fires which have destroyed most of the older buildings. On 29 April 1676 a fire destroyed over half of the buildings in the village, over a hundred houses. Only two dwellings from before 1676 survive today: 11 High Street and 278 High Street. The fire that occurred on 4 April 1850 is known as the Great Fire, and started on the High Street. Forty to fifty cottages burnt down, as well as the Black Horse and White Horse inns and the Wesleyan Chapel, which was housed in a barn on what is now Telegraph Street. Smaller fires were recorded in 1827, 1847 and 1852, each of which destroyed at least ten dwellings. =Victorian Development= The village‚Äôs population boomed throughout the early 19th century, rising from 1100 in 1801 to 2300 in 1851. The Inclosure Acts in 1847 saw a widespread program of land ownership and road-building, resulting in improved road routes to Rampton, Oakington and Landbeach along with the creation of long and straight drove roads for livestock. Permanent drainage of the Fens by steam-powered pumping engines was authorised in 1842. These engines were later fuelled by oil and diesel before being converted to electricity in 1986. The size of the village resulted in comparatively early arrival of public services including a resident police constable from 1841, a post office from 1843 and street lamps from 1849. A typhoid outbreak in the 1850s resulted in a drive to improve the village clean water supply, which was achieved by the New Cottenham Gas and Water Company, who sank a deep well and converted a Rampton Road windmill into a water tower, which is still present today. The success of this scheme allowed for the introduction of piped water from 1903. Proposals were drawn up for a light railway to assist in the export of goods such as fruit, wheat and cheese to Cambridge, but was never built. The village's nearest railway stations for goods export were at Histon and Oakington, on the Cambridge and St Ives branch line. This line has now been converted into the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, a rapid transit bus commuter service into Cambridge which maintains the original train station stops. Transport Links to Cambridge Cottenham and other Fen Edge villages have increased in population as the city of Cambridge has continued to develop to the north of the River Cam. Cottenham lies five miles north of the city of Cambridge, bordered by the civil parish of Histon and Impington to the south. The village is directly connected by road to Cambridge by the B1049, with rail links to London at Waterbeach, accessible via Beach Road. Cycle commuters from Cottenham make use of a shared pedestrian and cycle track that lies between Cottenham and Histon, which is to be expanded towards Cambridge in 2018.Cambridge City Deal Cottenham lies four miles north-west of Cambridge Science Park and Cambridge Business Park, both accessible by car and by the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, which has an adjacent commuter cycle track. Cottenham also lies directly west of Cambridge Research Park, with bus services linking the village to Cambridge, Ely and to neighbouring Fen Edge villages. Amenities As a relatively large village, Cottenham has numerous amenities including two GP surgeries, a dental surgery, public library, Co- operative store, pharmacy, butcher, bakery, greengrocers, two newsagents (one of which now incorporates the Post Office) a primary school, and a secondary school and adult education centre combined in Cottenham Village College. There are numerous other small businesses, organisations and charities present in the village. Cottenham has four remaining public houses: The Chequers,The Chequers The Hop Bind,The Hop Bind The Jolly Millers (temporarily closed) and The Waggon and Horses. Cottenham also has a fish and chip shop and Chinese takeaway, as well as a curry house established in the former White Horse public house. The Cottenham Community Centre (CCC)Community Centre and coffee shop is on the High Street on the site of the old Methodist church, opposite the Co-op. All Saints' Church All Saints' Church is the Anglican parish church and is the largest major landmark in the village, located at the top of the High Street and visible from the surrounding fenland.All Saints Cottenham The church's page at the Cambridgeshire Churches website The earliest documented evidence of a church in Cottenham is in a Charter of Saxon King Edred in 948. This church was replaced by a Norman edifice in the 12th century, fragments of which can still be seen in the present building, which itself dates from the 15th century. The church is in the decorated gothic and perpendicular styles consisting of chancel, nave, aisles, north and south porches and a 100-foot-tall tower with four pinnacles containing a clock and six bells. A storm destroyed all but the base of the original church steeple, which was rebuilt between 1617 and 1619. The building has undergone numerous refurbishments over the years, most notably in 1867 when the interior saw major restoration, and 1928 when the upper bell tower saw major repairs completed.Cottenham All Saints Sport and recreation The recreation ground is located off Lamb's Lane and is home to Cottenham United Football Club, Cottenham Cricket Club and a bowling green and tennis club. A social club was formed in 1965 to manage the facilities, overseeing the building of a new pavilion in 1974 and the extension of grounds in 1980.British History: Cottenham Introduction The Village College provides a gymnasium, sports centre and field, 3G pitch and tennis courts for the community.Cottenham Sports Centre The college is also home to the Cottenham Renegades, north Cambridge's only rugby-for-pleasure club; the team is also affiliated with The Cottenham Club.Cottenham Renegades =Cottenham Racecourse= Horse riding is relatively popular in the parish, with numerous maintained bridleways and riding clubs. A racecourse lies directly to the east of the village at Mason‚Äôs Pasture off Beach Road. The University of Cambridge horse racing clubs have been riding at Mason's Pasture since the late 18th century. The Grand National Hunt Steeple Chase, now held at the Cheltenham Festival, was staged there in 1870 and 1877.Stevens, Peter, History of the National Hunt Chase 1860‚Äì2010. A permanent course was laid out in the 1880s and the land bought by the parish in 1918, with the grandstand rebuilt in 1923. The racecourse is used for three point-to-point race meetings each year, usually in January, February and March. Notable residents Immigrant to the American colony of New England, John Coolidge, was born in Cottenham and baptised at All Saints' Church in September 1604. Among his many notable American descendants is US President J. Calvin Coolidge. The family home is believed to be the thatched cottage adjacent to All Saints‚Äô Church.Coolidge, Emma Downing, Descendants of John and Mary Coolidge of Watertown, Massachusetts, 1630, Boston: Wright & Potter Printing Co., 1930 Calvin Coolidge contributed funds to the restoration of the church tower in 1928. The grandmother of the diarist Samuel Pepys lived in Cottenham; their house in the northern area of the village bears a plaque. Sir Richard Pepys (d.1659) was Lord Justice of Ireland. In 1703, Mrs Catherine Pepys founded a Charity School in the village when she donated a house for a schoolmaster and ¬£150 to purchase land and provide teaching for sixteen poor children. The village gave its name to the title of another member of the Pepys family, Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham (d. 1851), who during his life also held the position of Lord Chancellor. Thomas Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury between 1694 and 1715 was born in Cottenham in 1636. The Norwich City and Leeds United F.C. footballer Adam Drury was born in Cottenham. Cottenham village design statement Cottenham was one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to produce a Village design statement. It was one of four pilot projects, the others being Stratford-on-Avon, Cartmel in Cumbria and Down Ampney in Gloucestershire. These were promoted as \\"exemplars\\", together with written guidance training and advice for other communities wishing to take up the initiative.

Born in Granada, he left Spain in 1150, probably on account of persecution by the Almohades, and went to Lunel in southern France. Benjamin of Tudela mentions him as a physician there in 1160. He died around 1190, in Marseille, France. Judah lived on terms of intimacy with Meshullam ben Jacob and with Meshullam's two sons, Asher and Aaron, whom in his will he recommends as friends to his only son, Samuel. He was also a close friend of Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res and of Zerahiah ha-Levi, the latter of whom he freely recognized as a greater scholar than himself, and whose son he also wished to have as a friend for his own son. He had two daughters whose marriage caused him much anxiety. Translations Judah's works include the translation into Hebrew of the following: *Bahya ibn Paquda's Chovot ha-Levavot. The Arabic title of this work was \\"Al-Hidayah ila Fara'id al-Qulub.\\" In English, 'The Duties of the Heart'. :He was induced to undertake this work by Meshullam ben Jacob and his son Asher, at whose desire he translated the first treatise, in 1161. After its completion Joseph Kimhi translated the other nine treatises and afterward the first one also. At the wish of Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res, Judah continued his translation of the work. Judah's translation is the only one that has held its place. *Solomon ibn Gabirol's Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh (printed together with the first-mentioned translation at Constantinople in 1550). *Judah ha-Levi's Kitab al-·∏§ujjah, under the title Sefer ha-Kuzari (1167). In this instance as well, Judah's translation drove that of his rival, Judah ibn Cardinal, out of the field, so that only a small portion of the latter's work has been preserved. *Two works by Ibn Janah: :*His grammar, Kitab al-Luma' , under the title Sefer ha-Rikmah (1171; edited by B. Goldberg, with notes by R. Kirchheim, Frankfurt-on-the-Main, 1856). The translator's preface is interesting for the history of literature, and it gives Judah's opinions on the art of Hebrew translation. :*Kitab al-U·π£ul, under the title Sefer ha-Shorashim (edited by Bacher, Berlin, 1896). Isaac al- Barceloni and Isaac ha-Levi had already translated this dictionary as far as the letter lamed, and Judah finished it in 1171. *Saadia's Kitab al-Amanat wal-I'ti·∏≥adat, under the title Sefer ha-Emunot weha-De'ot (1186; first ed. Constantinople, 1562). Testament Judah's ethical will, with its homely style and frankness, is one of the most interesting in this class of literature. It gives insight into the soul of the man and his relation to his son, also a scholar and translator, Samuel. Against the latter his chief complaint is that he never initiated his father into his literary or business affairs, never asked for his advice, and, in fact, hid everything from him. He recommends Samuel to practise writing in Arabic, since Jews like Samuel ha- Nagid, for example, attained rank and position solely through being able to write in that language. He exhorts him to morality and to the study of the Torah as well as of the profane sciences, including medicine. He is to read grammatical works on Sabbaths and festivals, and is not to neglect the reading of \\"Mishle\\" and of \\"Ben Mishle.\\" In regard to his medical practise he gives his son sage advice. He further advises his son to observe rigorously the laws of diet, lest he, like others, become ill frequently in consequence of intemperate and unwholesome eating, which would not fail to engender mistrust in him as a physician on the part of the general public. Interesting are Judah's references to his library as his \\"best treasure\\", his \\"best companion\\", and to his book-shelves as \\"the most beautiful pleasure-gardens.\\" He adds: > I have collected a large library for thy sake so that thou needest never > borrow a book of any one. As thou thyself seest, most students run hither > and thither searching for books without being able to find them. . . . Look > over thy Hebrew books every month, thy Arabic ones every two months, thy > bound books every three months. Keep thy library in order, so that thou wilt > not need to search for a book. Prepare a list of the books on each shelf, > and place each book on its proper shelf. Take care also of the loose, > separate leaves in thy books, because they contain exceedingly important > things which I myself have collected and written down. Lose no writing and > no letter which I leave thee. . . . Cover thy book-shelves with beautiful > curtains, protect them from water from the roof, from mice, and from all > harm, because they are thy best treasure. His fine linguistic sense and his conception of the art of translating are shown by his counsels on this subject.

It was originally named after Francis William Reitz, the then president of the Orange Free State where the stone was discovered, before being renamed to honour the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897. The original stone, a rough octahedron weighing 650.80 carats (130.16 g), was discovered in 1895 at the Jagersfontein Mine in South Africa. A consortium of diamond merchants from London purchased it along with its even larger sister, the Excelsior, in 1896, and sent it to Amsterdam where it was polished by M.B. Barends. A 40 carat (8 g) chunk was removed, which itself yielded a 13.34 carat (2.668 g) pear-shaped gem eventually purchased by Carlos I of Portugal. Dorabji Tata acquired it around 1900 and gave it to his wife Meherbai. She used to wear it during her visits to the royal courts and public functions. The Jubilee Diamond was the largest in the world until 1905 when a bigger diamond was exhibited. It was sold only after his death in 1932 and the money went to the formation of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.The Sir Dorabji Tata Trust ‚Äì A Historical Perspective , Sir Dorabji Tata Trust website  References  * \\"The Jubilee\\", Famous, Historic and Notable Diamonds Category:Diamonds originating in South Africa Category:1895 in South Africa Category:Individual diamonds ","title":"Jubilee Diamond"},{"id":"1909047","text":"This is a list of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1966. 1966 United States and Canadian Fellows *Peter Agostini, deceased.

History =Early life= Farquhar was born in Newhall, Aberdeenshire, near Aberdeen in 1774 as the youngest child of Robert Farquhar and Agnes Morrison, his father's second wife. . His brother, Arthur, two years his senior, rose to the rank of rear admiral in the Royal Navy, and received a knighthood for his distinguished services during the Napoleonic Wars. Farquhar joined the East India Company as a cadet at the age of 17. Shortly after arriving in Madras on 19 June 1791, he was promoted to a low-rank commissioned officer of the Madras Engineers on 22 June 1791. Two years later, on 16 August 1793, he became a lieutenant in the Madras Engineers. =Malacca= Farquhar was Chief Engineer in the expeditionary force which took Malacca from the Dutch on 18 August 1795. He spoke Malay and was popularly known as the Rajah of Malacca. He kept a Malaccan-French mistress, Antoinette \\"Nonio\\" Clement, with whom he had at least six children, one of which died while still an infant. Their eldest daughter Esther Farquhar married Capt. Francis James Bernard who became a prominent part of early Singapore. On 1 January 1803 he was promoted to the rank of full captain. From 1802 he acted as Resident of Malacca, and was made a full major in Corps on 26 September 1812, before he was officially appointed Resident and Commandant of Malacca in December 1813; a position he held for several years, in charge of both civil and military offices, until the Dutch returned in September 1818. During his tenure here he assisted in missions around the region, including the British invasion of Java led by Governor-General Baron Minto and Sir Stamford Raffles in August 1812. An engineer, his reputation was established by his long and successful term as Resident of Malacca, of which he was given charge when it passed into British hands from the Dutch. A task given him by the British Government was to demolish all the structures left by the former occupants; he blew up the fortifications with gunpowder but spared some of the other buildings, showing great intelligence. =Singapore= With his long Malayan experience and an intimate knowledge of Riau-Lingga politics, Major Farquhar was given the task to help Sir Stamford Raffles find a settlement on Singapore island. He helped negotiate the provisional agreement of 30 January 1819 with the local chieftain Temenggong Abdul Rahman; and the more formal Singapore Treaty of 6 February 1819, which Raffles signed with the Temenggong and the Sultan Hussein Mohammed Shah, confirming the right for the British to set up a trading post. On the same day, Farquhar, accompanied by a few Malaccan Malays, had to climb up the hill, known as the Bukit Larangan. He drew up the first gun and set up the post to hoist the Union Jack flag on top of the hill, marking the birth of Singapore as a British settlement. Raffles appointed Farquhar as Singapore's First Resident to develop the colony according to a specific plan Raffles had drawn up. Raffles left Singapore on the following day and Farquhar was left to manage the colony when Raffles left, an absence eventually lasting four years. He was appointed the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore, 1819‚Äì23. Farquhar took a more laissez-faire approach, which suited the local traders who had followed him there. In his new post, he quickly set about clearing the plain on the northeast bank of the Singapore River. Word of this new trading post soon spread and Singapore became a thriving cosmopolitan town. Communication with Raffles in Bencoolen and the East India Company in Calcutta were so poor that for more than three years Singapore developed on her own with Farquhar at the helm. On 9 May 1821, Farquhar was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration that conflicted with Raffles' instructions, notably in allowing the erection of houses and go-downs on the Padang and on the nearby banks of the Singapore River. His justification was that in the rapidly expanding settlement 'nothing is heard in the shape of complaint but the want of more ground to build on'. However, when Raffles returned in October 1822, he was furious to discover his plans had been neglected and that moreover local vices, such as the trading of opium and slave-trading, were being tolerated. He then dismissed Farquhar, who first refused to leave and later sued Raffles for tyrannical behaviour. Stabbing of Farquhar On 11 March 1824, Sayid Yasin, a Muslim merchant from the established Malay community in Singapore, stabbed Farquhar as he walked in his gardens. Sayid was prevented from completing his task only by the timely arrival of Farquhar's servants, who killed the assailant immediately. The stabbing was not fatal. The European settlers assumed immediately that Sayid must have been acting in the name of the Temenggong Abdul Rahman, but that was not true. Sayid and Farquhar then had a semi-private dispute; when Sayid was proven unable to pay his debts, Farquhar sent him to gaol. That fate was humiliating to Sayid and so he sought revenge. Raffles argued that an attack on an official should be met with an exemplary punishment and called for Sayid's corpse to be put in chains in an iron cage and exhibited publicly at Tanjong Malang for a fortnight. Sayid's grave at Tanjong Pagar, however, would soon become a shrine and remained a place of pilgrimage for many years, making many Europeans think that Raffles had endangered their lives by needlessly antagonising the Malays. Departure from Southeast Asia The conflicts which arose during Raffles' final stay in Singapore in 1821‚Äì23, led to Farquhar's dismissal on 1 May 1823, to be succeeded as Resident by Dr John Crawfurd without the knowledge of Farquhar himself. He remained in Singapore after that for a few months. At a farewell dinner with the principal merchants and British inhabitants on 27 December 1823, Lt Col William Farquhar was presented with a plate valued at 3000 sicca rupees as a farewell gift. The Chinese community of the settlement gifted Farquhar with an ornate silver epergne bearing crests, a Latin inscription, and the hallmark \\"1825\\". Shortly after, he finally departed from Singapore for Malacca, Penang and Calcutta en route back home to England. Farquhar's popularity with the Asian and the European community of Singapore was attested to by Munshi Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, in his Hikayat Abdullah. One example was the moving account of Farquhar's departure from Singapore at the end of December 1823, which was confirmed by a report in one of Calcutta's newspapers, which states that on that day as he left, he was accompanied to the beach by most of the European inhabitants of the settlement as well as by 'a large concourse' of Asians of every class. As a compliment to him, the troops formed a guard-of-honour from his house to the landing place, and he embarked with the customary salute to his rank. Then many Asian boats accompanied him to his ship, the Alexander, and as they sailed, some of the Siamese vessels fired salutes to him. Similar welcomes and tributes also awaited him up the Straits, in Malacca and in Penang. =Further dispute with Raffles= After his arrival in London in 1824, Farquhar wrote to the Court of Directors of the East India Company, complained of his unjust removal from office by Raffles, and requested the reinstatement of his command of Singapore. He described Singapore as \\"a settlement formed at his own suggestion and matured under his personal management\\", and asked the Directors to \\"appreciate those feelings of interest excited in his mind in regard to a Settlement selected and founded by himself.\\" When the Directors referred this Memorial to Raffles, he dismissed Farquhar's claim as peremptorily as he had dismissed Farquhar from office in April 1823. Raffles replied: \\"On the credit assumed by Lieutenant-Colonel Farquhar for having suggested the establishment of Singapore, this is the first time I ever heard of the circumstance, and on reference to the public records I find nothing to support it. A regard to truth compels me to deny in broad terms that Colonel Farquhar ever suggested, or, to my knowledge, knew or stated anything with regard to the formation of a Settlement at Singapore, until I communicated to him the authority with which I was invested, to form a Settlement there.\\" In Farquhar's brief rejoinder to Raffles' reply, in April 1825, he omitted reference to Singapore and to his claim, and the Court of Directors finally ruled against him in November 1825, refusing his request to be reinstated. Raffles commented in a letter to his sister: \\"It was my wish poor Man that he should be let off as easily as possible, but he seems to have failed in all he attempted, and if he has not been so severely handled as he might have been he has me to thank for it -- for certainly he stands on no better footing than he did before he made his Appeal.\\" Retirement and death Oil on canvas, c. 1830 Farquhar settled in Perth, Scotland, in late 1826, where he bought two large recently completed Georgian houses (one for his brother, a naval captain) and built a billiard hall for the entertainment of his many friends. He married Margaret Loban on 7 April 1828, and had six children with her, including one daughter who died in infancy. Farquhar was promoted to the rank of Colonel in 1829. In 1830, Farquhar challenged certain statements made by Lady Sophia Raffles, the widow of the late Stamford Raffles who had died on 5 July 1826, in her book Memoir of the life and public services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, particularly in the government of Java, 1811-1816, and of Bencoolen and its dependencies, 1817-1824.http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6dd159de-811f-4012-9b43-01676a9c49a7/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&launchlogo;=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png He asserted that \\"She very modestly and candidly allows (her late husband) the sole and exclusive merit of having established and brought into commercial importance the new settlement of Singapore, which is styled his Settlement.\\" Farquhar published an article in which he contended that he had \\"at least a large share in forming that establishment\\" and that, having stated all the circumstances, he would \\"leave the public to judge on whether Lady Raffles can fairly claim for her husband the sole and exclusive merit of having formed the settlement of Singapore.\\" On 17 August 1833, Farquhar drafted the Deed of Settlement for his former mistress Antoinette \\"Nonio\\" Clement, to whom he bequeathed his house and contents in Kampong Glam, together with an annuity of sp350 paid half yearly in advance. In 1837, Farquhar was promoted to the rank of major-general. William Farquhar died on 11 May 1839 at age 66 in his home, Early Banks, in Perth, Scotland. He has a mausoleum in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Perth. On his tomb, there is the following inscription in block capitals: \\"Sacred to the Memory of Major General William Farquhar of the H.E.I.C. Service and Madras Engineer Corps who served in the East Indies upwards of 33 years. During 20 years of his valuable life he was appointed to offices of high responsibility under the civil government of India having in addition to his military duties served as Resident in Malacca and afterwards at Singapore which later settlement he founded. In all the stations which he filled he acquired honour to himself and rendered service to his country. He departed this life at Early Bank, Perth, on the 11th of May 1839, highly respected and deeply regretted by all who had the happiness of his acquaintance.\\" Legacy Farquhar Street, a former street in Singapore, was named after him. This street was located in the Kampong Glam area between Beach Road and North Bridge Road. It was expunged in 1994 due to street realignment and no longer exists. Lebuh Farquhar (Farquhar Street), another street in Penang, Malaysia is mistakenly thought to be named after him. It is actually named after Robert Townsend Farquhar (no relation), Lieutenant General of Penang from 1804-05.See also Webster, Anthony. British expansion in South East Asia and the role of Robert Farquhar, Lieutenant Governor of Penang, 1804-5. J. Imp. & Common. Hist., 23(1), 1995, 1-25. In 1993, the silver epergne, which William Farquhar received from the Chinese community before his departure from Singapore on 27 December 1823, was acquired by the National Museum of Singapore from his descendant Captain David John Farquhar Atkins, for S$52,000. Through his eldest daughter Esther Asther Bernard (n√©e Farquhar), Farquhar is a fifth great-grandfather of Justin Trudeau, the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada, and fourth great-grandfather of Margaret Trudeau, onetime wife of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada. Natural history drawings watercolour drawing of a zebra dove (Geopelia striata) perched on a purple mangosteen tree (Garcinia mangostana), from the William Farquhar collection of natural history drawings Between 1819 and 1823 Farquhar commissioned unidentified Chinese artists to illustrate local flora and fauna. This project resulted in 477 watercolours of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects found in Malacca and Singapore. These paintings played a pivotal role in revealing the region's biodiversity to Western naturalists, and are interesting in their blending of the stylised oriental manner with the realism of western art. The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, showing 141 of these illustrations, was published in 1999. A volume containing prints of all 477 works in the Farquhar collection was published by Editions Didier Millet and the National Museum of Singapore in 2010. Sources *Brazil, David.

He has also been involved in other musical projects including New Found Glory, Coalesce, Leathermouth, and Death Spells. History =Early life and Coalesce= Dewees graduated from Liberty High School in Liberty, Missouri in 1994. He started college at William Jewell College in Liberty later transferring to the University of Missouri to study music composition. In 1995, he was asked to replace Sean Ingram as vocalist for the Kansas City hardcore band Coalesce. This angered Ingram, and caused a fight that eventually broke the band up. However, in the summer of 1996, the band decided to re-form, but this time with James Dewees as a drummer. With them, he recorded the band's first two full-length albums Give Them Rope and Functioning on Impatience. Dewees was later kicked out of college for missing too many classes while touring with the band. =The Get Up Kids= In 1997, Coalesce played a music festival in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania with fellow Kansas-Citians The Get Up Kids. At the end of Coalesce's set, they began smashing all of their equipment, and James picked up his Floor tom and threw it into the audience, hitting a girl on the head. Someone picked it up and tried to steal it, so James began chasing him, along with The Get Up Kids' guitarist Jim Suptic. They started talking, and Suptic invited James to hang out with the rest of the band. Kelley, Trevor \\"Say Goodnight, But Mean Goodbye; An Oral History of The Get Up Kids\\" Alternative Press Magazine, July 2005 Coalesce and The Get Up Kids began collaborating more and more, playing shows together and eventually covering each other's songs for a split 7\\". James recorded keyboard for the band on their Red Letter Day EP, and after its release, joined the band full-time. After the release of the band's second album Something to Write Home About, The Get Up Kids began receiving much greater national attention. In order to capitalize off of the success of Something to Write Home About, as well as bridge the gap between their next album, the band released a collection of B-sides and rarities, entitled Eudora, in 2000. This also included a re-make of \\"A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts\\", with a new arrangement placing a much heavier emphasis on the piano. In 2002, the band released their third studio album, On a Wire, produced by Scott Litt. The album was a major departure from the band's previous, poppier sound, and struggled sales-wise as a result. In 2004, the band released their fourth album Guilt Show. The album was met with a much warmer reception than On a Wire, but there was a great deal of tension between the bandmates during their world tour supporting the release. Lead singer Matt Pryor, whose wife had recently given birth, wanted to spend more time at home. At one stop in Australia, the band broke up before deciding to finish the tour. However, they decided that they would do one final farewell tour before going their separate ways for good. Around the beginning of their final tour, the band released Live! @ The Granada Theater, their first live album. The album was recorded at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas at the band's tenth-anniversary show. On July 2, 2005, the band played their final show at The Uptown Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. On August 28, 2008, James announced there will be a reunion tour in 2009. The Get Up Kids also did a tour in Japan in November 2013. The band played US shows in Spring 2015. On September 7, 2019 it was announced through the band's instagram page that Dewees was no longer a member of The Get Up Kids. =Reggie and the Full Effect= While playing with the Get Up Kids full-time, Dewees began to write some of his own songs. However, he did not feel as though they fit with the distinct style of The Get Up Kids, so with the assistance of bandmate Matt Pryor, he recorded Greatest Hits 1984-1987, releasing it on Vagrant Records in 1998 under the name Reggie and the Full Effect.Reggie And The Full Effect  Vagrant Records He continued to write songs, finally releasing his second album Promotional Copy two years later. In 2003, he released a third album entitled Under the Tray. After this album released, his marriage to his first wife Megan began to break down. He was soon involved in a bitter divorce, much of which inspired his fourth album Songs Not to Get Married To, which he was writing and recording during the divorce.Reggie & The Full Effect  Music Artist  Videos, News, Photos & Ringtones  MTV On April 8, 2008, Alternative Press announced that they had received details on the new album from Reggie and the Full Effect.

Titled No Country for Old Musicians, the album was released in November 2013 under Pure Noise Records. In February 2018, he released '41', again through Pure Noise. =Other work= Dewees in 2011 After The Get Up Kids split up in the summer of 2005, James entered the studio to write and record tracks with New Found Glory for their album Catalyst, later embarking with them on a tour to support the album. In 2007, he joined My Chemical Romance as their touring keyboardist, becoming an official member albeit for a short period of time in 2012 until the band's split in 2013. In late 2012, Dewees began collaborating with Get Up Kids bandmate Matt Pryor on a series of demos. The collaboration grew into several east-coast tours in early 2013, and a 'Matt Pryor and James Dewees' EP in October 2013. He also formed digital hardcore act, Death Spells, alongside Frank Iero. The duo began touring and released their debut single \\"Where Are My Fucking Pills?\\" and an accompanying music video. Death Spells released full-length album 'Nothing Above, Nothing Below' in 2016. In 2014, Reggie and the Full Effect went on a spring US headline tour then followed it up by supporting Say Anything and Saves The Day on their end of the year anniversary tour, choosing to perform Under the Tray in full. Dewees also contributed to Gerard Way's debut album Hesitant Alien, and began touring alongside Way as the keyboardist of his backing band, The Hormones. =Personalities= On the various Reggie albums, James has created a series of different personas that appear as \\"guests\\" on the album.

It is the oldest library in Belfast and the last subscribing library in Northern Ireland. The Library is physically in the centre of Belfast, and more generally at the centre of the cultural and creative life of the wider community. It is an independent and charitable body. History =Early history= The original Linen Hall Library in 1888, shortly before its demolition and replacement with alt=A black and white photograph, showing a stately-looking two storey building with white walls, extending out of shot to the left and right, with an arched cart entrance at the centre. A modest clocktower rises above the entrance, and the building is surrounded by neat shrubbery and iron railings. A wide street crosses left- right outside of the fence, with a handful of horse-drawn carts and pedestrians in 19th century clothing. The Linen Hall Library is a unique institution. It was founded in 1788 by a group of artisans as the Belfast Reading Society and in 1792 became the Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge. It adopted a resolution in 1795 \\"that the object of this Society is the collection of an extensive Library, philosophical apparatus and such products of nature and art as tend to improve the mind and excite a spirit of general enquiry\\".Linen Hall Library (1968) Prospectus and by-laws; p. 2 It began to acquire books (with a particular focus on those relating to Irish topics, publishing, for example Ancient Irish Music by Edward Bunting in 1796) and also other items which could be used to advance knowledge. The society declined in the later 1790s however, as it owned no permanent premises and struggled with official attempts to control radical thought, though it survived a crackdown after the 1798 rebellion thanks to the efforts of Rev. William Bruce. In 1802 the Library moved into permanent premises in White Linen Hall (from which it took its name, though legally it is still the Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge). The Library struggled, however, through most of the 19th century. It became more conservative, attempting to exclude students from Queen's College and debating whether or not to include fiction. As the Library's centenary approached it was hit by another setback as it lost its premises in White Linen Hall to make way for the construction of the new City Hall. The Library moved into a warehouse in Donegall Square (previously used for linen), which was designed by Charles Lanyon and his firm, and which the Library occupies as of 2009. At the same time it made the transition from being a private company to one with public duties with regard to care for its collections. This was also a period when the Library became much more ambitious, collecting books with a new vigour and implementing many cultural programmes. Linen Hall Library, October 2009 In the Interwar period the Library's success continued as the public library system was slow to develop and even after World War II it was a hub of creativity in Northern Ireland. It failed to secure this position, though and in the years following began to decline. Investment in public libraries combined with extensive IRA bombing in the city centre led to membership levels falling. By the end of the 1970s the Library was on the brink of closure, with large amounts of material (including an extensive collection relating to The Troubles) but a poor building, few users and serious money problems. In response, the Department of Education threatened to withdraw its grant and in 1980 proposals were made to close the Library permanently. =Later history= After 1980 a fight began to save the library. It was decided that it should begin to allow and encourage free public reference access and to concentrate particularly on Irish studies, politics and culture, both because it was already strong in these areas and so as not to compete with the expanded Central Reference Library. The move was a success. The number of subscribers began to increase and the library increased its role as a cultural centre, both facilitating research and fostering close links with the wider community. It quickly became apparent that lack of space was holding back the library's revival. After spending ten years exploring various options before purchasing a 999-year lease on the upper floors of some neighbouring property in 1996. This was followed by an extensive fundraising campaign to pay for the development of this new property. Construction began in 1999 and was completed in time for the opening on 16 September 2000. On 27 October 2016 Linen Hall Board President Anne Davies and Director Julie Andrews had the honor of welcoming President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins for his first visit to the library. A poet himself, Higgins was particularly interested in resources pertaining to local poet Sir Samuel Ferguson. A choir consisting of students from Holy Cross Boys‚Äô Primary School and Campbell College performed for the guests of the notable event. Holdings In addition to providing a free public reference service and a general lending service for both adults and children the Library also houses several special collections. It is the leading centre for \\"Irish and Local Studies\\" in Northern Ireland which includes its comprehensive stock of \\"Early Belfast and Ulster printed books\\", periodicals and newspapers dating back as far as 1738 and a wide variety of archive and manuscript material. It also contains an extensive collection of maps (some of great historical interest) and extensive materials in the Irish language. Its \\"Northern Ireland Political Collection\\" collected since 1968 contains 250,000 items and is the definitive archive of the recent troubles, containing material looking at all sides of the conflict. It also houses collections devoted to genealogy, the poet Robert Burns and Northern Irish performing art. Since there is no national library for Northern Ireland, the Linen Hall Library is collecting all books and journals published in Northern Ireland in the 21st century to create NIPR, the National Collection of Northern Ireland Publications (originally the Northern Ireland Publication Resource). The collection is split between the Linen Hall Library and Belfast Central Library.NIPR (Research and Special Collections Available Locally) , 25 August 2018 (accessed 27 September 2018)  References   External links  * Linen Hall Library Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Education in Belfast Category:Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize recipients Category:Libraries in Northern Ireland Category:Subscribing libraries in the United Kingdom Category:Archives in Northern Ireland Category:History museums in Northern Ireland Category:Grade B1 listed buildings Category:Tourist attractions in Belfast Category:1788 establishments in Ireland ","title":"Linen Hall Library"},{"id":"1909177","text":"Joan Lunden (born Joan Elise Blunden on September 19, 1950) is an American journalist, an author, and a television host.

The Jews) is an Israeli hard rock band, formed in 1992 by (now married) couple Tom Petrover and Orit Shahaf, who share guitar playing and vocal duties. The band has achieved tremendous success in Israel despite relative commercial disregard in its first years, and has sold over 200,000 albums in Israel. The band is known for its energetic, dark-themed songs and loud vocals. The band sings mostly in Hebrew, although in later albums they have several songs in English. History The name of the band was suggested by their producer. The band's first album, Metziut Nifredet (, Separate Reality) was released in 1995 through Hed Arzi Music. Several music videos from the album were often played on Israeli television, but not on the radio and initially the album sold poorly. However the band continued playing live shows all over Israel, gaining a cult following. The debut album went gold in 1998, and later on achieved double platinum. The second album, self- titled HaYehudim and released in 1998, and was an immediate success despite continuing disregard from mainstream media, making HaYehudim one of the leading rock bands in Israel. This album, too, attained gold status. In 1999 Hayehudim were elected as Band of the Year on Galey Tzahal, Israel's national radio station. The same year, they opened the Metallica concert in Israel, and in 2000 the band opened the Rage Against the Machine concert in Israel as well. Four years after their second album, Hayehudim released a third studio album by the name of Pahad Mavet (, Scared to Death) in 2002. The next year Hayehudim released their first live album - a double CD and DVD set named Hayhudim LIVE. The live album was a great success and the following year the band released a second live album, this time of an unplugged show. In 2007 Hayehudim released their fourth studio album, Forte (). In musicology, the term forte means strong, and the name was chosen because if you hadn't had enough of Hayehudim till now, you're about to get Hayehudim forte (meaning Hayehudim extra-strong, as Tom Petrover explained in a radio interview).

It is a small tree or shrub that grows tall, with rose to red-purple flowers. The flowers are small and bell-shaped, with five petals that have whitish edges. The flowers are often produced year round under tropical conditions. The tree is cultivated in tropical and semitropical regions for its edible fruits and for its medicinal uses. Origins and distribution Sliced carambolas having 7, 6, and the usual 5 points The center of diversity and the original range of Averrhoa carambola is tropical Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated since ancient times. It was introduced to the Indian Subcontinent and Sri Lanka by Austronesian traders, along with ancient Austronesian cultigens like coconuts, langsat, noni, and santol. Description fruit, leaves, and flowers of Averrhoa carambola A seedling Averrhoa carambola is a small, slow-growing evergreen tree with a short-trunk or a shrub. The branches are drooping and the wood is white and turns reddish. It has a bushy shape with many branches producing a broad, rounded crown. The compound leaves are soft, medium-green, they are spirally arranged around the branches in an alternate fashion. The pinnate leaves have a single terminal leaflet and 5 to 11 nearly opposite leaflets, each leaf is 15‚Äì20 cm long, and the 3.8‚Äì9 cm long leaflets are ovate or ovate-oblong in shape. The top sides of the leaves are smooth and the undersides are finely hairy and whitish. The leaflets are reactive to light and tend to fold together at night, they are also sensitive to abrupt shock and when shaken tend to close up also. The lilac or purple-streaked, downy, flowers are produced in the axils of leaves at the end of twigs. The flowers are arranged in small clusters on the ends of the branches or sometimes on the larger stems and trunk, each cluster is attached to the tree with red stalks. The bell-shaped, perfect flowers, are produced in loose panicles that are much-branched with pedicellate flowers; each flower is around 6 mm wide, with 5 petals that have recurved ends. The fruits are showy with an oblong shape: they are longitudinally 5- to 6-angled and 6.35‚Äì15 cm long and up to 9 cm wide. The fruits have a thin, waxy skin that is orange-yellow colored. The juicy fruits are yellow inside when ripe and have a crisp texture and when cut in cross-section are star-shaped. The fruits have an oxalic acid odor, which varies between plants from strong to mild, the taste also varies from very sour to mildly sweetish. Each fruit may have up to twelve 6‚Äì12.5 mm long seeds, which are flat, thin and brown. Some cultivated forms produce fruits with no seeds. Taxonomy Leaves ‚Äì both sides in India Flowers The species in the genus Averrhoa along with the species in genus Sarcotheca are the only woody, tree-like plants belonging to the Oxalis family Oxalidaceae. The Oxalis family has nearly 900 species, most are herbaceous perennials or annuals native from tropical and semitropical locations though a number also grow in other parts of the world. Averrhoa has sometimes been placed in the family Averrhoaceae. Averrhoa carambola is one of two species in the genus Averrhoa, both have edible fruit; the other species Averrhoa bilimbi, which is sometimes called the Bilimbi or the Cucumber Tree, is limited to tropical regions. The fruits of A. bilimbi are too sour to be eaten raw, while the sweet forms A. carambola are eaten raw. The fruits of A. bilimbi and the sour forms‚Äîwhich have high oxalic acid content‚Äîof A. carambola are pickled and made into jelly, jam, and juice. The genus was named after Ab≈´ 'l-Walƒ´d Mu·∏•ammad bin A·∏•mad bin Rushd (better known just as Ibn Rushd), who was called Averroes in European literature - a famous Arabian physician, astronomer and philosopher of the 12th century.

Med. vol. 2, 543. 1812. * Connaropsis philippica Villar in Blanco, Fl. Filip. ed. vol. 3, app. 33. 1880. The tree and fruits have many different names, Carambola is the Spanish vernacular name of the tree. In English it is called Star fruit, Five-corner or Carambola, in Malaysia and the Philippines it has numerous names. In Indonesia it is called belimbing, in Tagalog it is called balimbing. The related bilimbi is called kamias in Tagalog. In French, the tree is called \\"carambolier\\" and the fruit \\"carambole\\". Cultivation Fruits, leaves and trunk Averrhoa carambola has a number of different forms differing in fruit taste, texture, and shape, some are very acidic and others are sweet. The plant is grown in Malaysia and Taiwan, with smaller concentrations in Thailand, Israel, The United States, Brazil, Philippines, China, Australia, Indonesia and the warmer parts of India and other areas of the world with the same climate. It has become a commercial crop in many of these locations, grown for its edible fruits. The flowers need cross- pollination to produce fruit, thus seed raised plants are variable. Plants may flower and bear fruit in about a year after seed germination. Larger plants may bloom year-round in tropical areas as long as environmental conditions are suitable, plants may have flowers, unripe and ripe fruit at the same time. Under other climate and environmental conditions, plants tend to bloom in spring, and then off and on again during the rest of the year. Many different cultivars are grown, most are selected to optimize fruit flavor and maximum fruit production for specific growing areas, with each country or region having their own specific selections. Toxicology Like several other plants of the family Oxalidaceae, its fruits are rich in oxalic acid, which is toxic in high concentrations. There have been reports of intoxication in dialysis and uremic patients caused by a neurotoxin called caramboxin present in the fruit. Such toxin is normally filtered by the kidneys, but patients in dialysis or suffering from kidney deficiencies may show severe symptoms, in a few cases fatal, after drinking the fruit juice. Uses Averrhoa Carambola is best known as the star fruit, and is notorious for the star-like shape it has when it is cut. It is native to Southeast Asia, however, because this plant is not found in the wild it is difficult to pinpoint where exactly it originated. This fruit can be eaten, but it also can be used for medicinal purposes. Because of its antioxidant properties, many in Asia use the fruit to treat chickenpox, intestinal parasites, headaches, and many more. However, star fruit contains oxalate and too much of this molecule can be dangerous for patients. Because this fruit is often used for illnesses and consumption, there is a lot more research done on the plants nutritional and medicinal properties. In addition to its edibility, the fruit's juice is used to remove stains from linens.  Rapid plant movement  Rapid plant movement is seen in many plants and there are different mechanisms based on the speed of the movement and the situation the plant is in. Some plants may make movements within 2 seconds while some may take 20 seconds to complete a motion. Additionally, for some plants the movement can involve action potentials being activated, or it can involve changes in water pressure and fluctuation of ions moving in and out of cells. In the case of the Averrhoa Carambola plant it takes about 20 seconds for the leaves to move from their horizontal position to vertical. This mechanism involves the flux of ions and water. When the leaves receive an external stimulus (hands herbivores) this will translate to an electrical stimulus which then leads to the flow of ions (specifically the potassium and chloride) out of the pulvinus. Within the pulvinus, there are flexor and extensor cells, and this is where the change of potassium and chloride concentration occurs. So as you can see in the diagram, when the cell is in its turgid state, the leaves are horizontal, and cells are filled with water. So when the chloride and potassium move out of the cells, the water will flux out which results in the leaves facing vertically. This movement of the leaves drooping takes only a couple of seconds as we saw in the video. However, when the leaves or the tree is shaken, this will activate contractile proteins that are in the pulvinus, and they will cause the leaves to droop. There are a few benefits of the drooping of the leaves: one is that it has been hypothesized that when the leaves droop it makes the plant look malnourished and unappealing, so herbivores are compelled to eat a different plant. Additionally, the movement helps the plant with reducing water loss as well as avoid damages. The mechanism and reasoning for how this movement reduces water loss for plants is not fully known. However, one known mechanism is the closing of the stomatal pores which are the mouths of the plant in which gas exchange occurs. It takes in carbon dioxide which is important for photosynthesis. This movement of the stomatal pores is done by the guard cells that surround the pores. When there is not enough water in the air, the guard cells well release K+ ions into surrounding cells, and this causes water to move out of the guard cells. After the water is moved out the guard cells shrink in size as well as the stomata pores, and this prevents water from escaping through the pores. This information was obtained through Yahyai‚Äôs research on the starfruit tree‚Äôs response to differing soil water depletion levels. Trees were grown in a greenhouse, and there were four levels of soil water depletion. Stomatal response, CO2 levels, and transpiration were recorded and then analyzed. Finally, the drooping movement in the star fruit trees helps with reducing leaf damage, protecting it from increased leaf temperature, as well as losing photochemical efficiency (light energy being converted to be used for photosynthesis) from the sun. Excess radiation will act as a stimulus to these leaves, and they will respond with rapid movement. The leaf moving to a position that makes it parallel to the light source is important because the leaves won‚Äôt be directly facing the sun. This information was found through recording sun to leaf area exposure, canopy diameter, and root growth. Trees had different levels of sun exposure, and how the tree responded was measured and analyzed.Fruit Unfortunately, there is little information and experimentation done on these plants. However, through a few research papers, we are able to determine that there is a lot more to Averrhoa Carambola than its nutritional and medicinal properties.

One sense of the name refers to frames with teeth (also called shanks) that pierce the soil as they are dragged through it linearly. Another sense refers to machines that use rotary motion of disks or teeth to accomplish a similar result. The rotary tiller is a principal example. Cultivators stir and pulverize the soil, either before planting (to aerate the soil and prepare a smooth, loose seedbed) or after the crop has begun growing (to kill weeds‚Äîcontrolled disturbance of the topsoil close to the crop plants kills the surrounding weeds by uprooting them, burying their leaves to disrupt their photosynthesis, or a combination of both). Unlike a harrow, which disturbs the entire surface of the soil, cultivators are designed to disturb the soil in careful patterns, sparing the crop plants but disrupting the weeds. Cultivators of the toothed type are often similar in form to chisel plows, but their goals are different. Cultivator teeth work near the surface, usually for weed control, whereas chisel plow shanks work deep beneath the surface, breaking up hardpan. Consequently, cultivating also takes much less power per shank than does chisel plowing. Small toothed cultivators pushed or pulled by a single person are used as garden tools for small-scale gardening, such as for the household's own use or for small market gardens. Similarly sized rotary tillers combine the functions of harrow and cultivator into one multipurpose machine. Cultivators are usually either self-propelled or drawn as an attachment behind either a two-wheel tractor or four-wheel tractor. For two-wheel tractors they are usually rigidly fixed and powered via couplings to the tractors' transmission. For four-wheel tractors they are usually attached by means of a three-point hitch and driven by a power take-off (PTO). Drawbar hookup is also still commonly used worldwide. Draft-animal power is sometimes still used today, being somewhat common in developing nations although rare in more industrialized economies.  History  The basic idea of soil scratching for weed control is ancient and was done with hoes or mattocks for millennia before cultivators were developed. Cultivators were originally drawn by draft animals (such as horses, mules, or oxen) or were pushed or drawn by people. In modern commercial agriculture, the amount of cultivating done for weed control has been greatly reduced via use of herbicides instead. However, herbicides are not always desirable‚Äîfor example, in organic farming. The powered rotary hoe was invented by Arthur Clifford Howard who, in 1912, began experimenting with rotary tillage on his father's farm at Gilgandra, New South Wales, Australia. Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be mechanically tilled without soil-packing occurring, as was the case with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an L-shaped blade mounted on widely spaced flanges fixed to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I. In 1919 Howard returned to Australia and resumed his design work, patenting a design with 5 rotary hoe cultivator blades and an internal combustion engine in 1920. In March 1922, Howard formed the company Austral Auto Cultivators Pty Ltd, which later became known as Howard Auto Cultivators. It was based in Northmead, a suburb of Sydney, from 1927. Meanwhile, in North America during the 1910s, tractors were evolving away from traction engine-sized monsters toward smaller, lighter, more affordable machines. The Fordson tractor especially had made tractors affordable and practical for small and medium family farms for the first time in history. Cultivating was somewhat of an afterthought in the Fordson's design, which reflected the fact that even just bringing practical motorized tractive power alone to this market segment was in itself a milestone. This left an opportunity for others to pursue better motorized cultivating. Between 1915 and 1920, various inventors and farm implement companies experimented with a class of machines referred to as motor cultivators, which were simply modified horse-drawn shank-type cultivators with motors added for self-propulsion. This class of machines found limited market success. But by 1921 International Harvester had combined motorized cultivating with the other tasks of tractors (tractive power and belt work) to create the Farmall, the general-purpose tractor tailored to cultivating that basically invented the category of row-crop tractors. In Australia, by the 1930s, Howard was finding it increasingly difficult to meet a growing worldwide demand for exports of his machines. He travelled to the United Kingdom, founding the company Rotary Hoes Ltd in East Horndon, Essex, in July 1938. Branches of this new company subsequently opened in the United States of America, South Africa, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. It later became the holding company for Howard Rotavator Co. Ltd. The Howard Group of companies was acquired by the Danish Thrige Agro Group in 1985, and in December 2000 the Howard Group became a member of Kongskilde Industries of Soroe, Denmark. When herbicidal weed control was first widely commercialized in the 1950s and 1960s, it played into that era's optimistic worldview in which sciences such as chemistry would usher in a new age of modernity that would leave old-fashioned practices (such as weed control via cultivators) in the dustbin of history. Thus herbicidal weed control was adopted very widely, and in some cases too heavily and hastily. In subsequent decades, people overcame this initial imbalance and came to realize that herbicidal weed control has limitations and externalities, and it must be managed intelligently. It is still widely used, and probably will continue to be indispensable to affordable food production worldwide for the foreseeable future; but its wise management includes seeking alternate methods, such as the traditional standby of mechanical cultivation, where practical.  Industrial use  To the extent that cultivating is done commercially today (such as in truck farming), it is usually powered by tractors, especially row-crop tractors. Industrial cultivators can vary greatly in size and shape, from to wide. Many are equipped with hydraulic wings that fold up to make road travel easier and safer. Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between row crops. The cultivator may be an implement trailed after the tractor via a drawbar; mounted on the three-point hitch; or mounted on a frame beneath the tractor. Active cultivator implements are driven by a power take- off shaft. While most cultivator are considered a secondary tillage implement, active cultivators are commonly used for primary tillage in lighter soils instead of plowing. The largest versions available are about wide, and require a tractor with an excess of (PTO) to drive them. Field cultivators are used to complete tillage operations in many types of arable crop fields. The main function of the field cultivator is to prepare a proper seedbed for the crop to be planted into, to bury crop residue in the soil (helping to warm the soil before planting), to control weeds, and to mix and incorporate the soil to ensure the growing crop has enough water and nutrients to grow well during the growing season. The implement has many shanks mounted on the underside of a metal frame, and small narrow rods at the rear of the machine that smooth out the soil surface for easier travel later when planting. In most field cultivators, one-to-many hydraulic cylinders raise and lower the implement and control its depth. = Row crop cultivators = Homemade sweep. Notice the inner and outer \\"sweep\\" blades. The main function of the row crop cultivator is weed control between the rows of an established crop. Row crop cultivators are usually raised and lowered by a three-point hitch and the depth is controlled by gauge wheels. Sometimes referred to as sweep cultivators, these commonly have two center blades that cut weeds from the roots near the base of the crop and turn over soil, while two rear sweeps further outward than the center blades deal with the center of the row, and can be anywhere from 1 to 36 rows wide.http://www.animaltraction.net/Harnessingandimplements/HarnessingandImplementsintro.pdf  Garden cultivators  Small tilling equipment, used in small gardens such as household gardens and small commercial gardens, can provide both primary and secondary tillage. For example, a rotary tiller does both the \\"plowing\\" and the \\"harrowing\\", preparing a smooth, loose seedbed. It does not provide the row-wise weed control that cultivator teeth would. For that task, there are single-person-pushable toothed cultivators. = Variants and trademarks = A Japanese two-wheel tractor Rotary tillers are a type of cultivators. Rotary tillers are popular with home gardeners who want large vegetable gardens. The garden may be tilled a few times before planting each crop. Rotary tillers may be rented from tool rental centers for single-use applications, such as when planting grass. A small rotary hoe for domestic gardens was known by the trademark Rototiller and another, made by the Howard Group, who produced a range of rotary tillers, was known as the Rotavator. ; Rototiller: The small rototiller is typically propelled forward via a (1‚Äì5 horsepower or 0.8‚Äì3.5 kilowatts) petrol engine rotating the tines, and do not have powered wheels, though they may have small transport/level control wheel(s). To keep the machine from moving forward too fast, an adjustable tine is usually fixed just behind the blades so that through friction with deeper un-tilled soil, it acts as a brake, slowing the machine and allowing it to pulverize the soils. The slower a rototiller moves forward, the more soil tilth can be obtained. The operator can control the amount of friction/braking action by raising and lowering the handlebars of the tiller. Rototillers often do not have a reverse as such backwards movement towards the operator could cause serious injury. While operating, the rototiller can be pulled backwards to go over areas that were not pulverized enough, but care must be taken to ensure that the operator does not stumble and pull the rototiller on top of himself. Rototilling is much faster than manual tilling, but notoriously difficult to handle and exhausting work, especially in the heavier and higher horsepower models. If the rototiller's blades catch on unseen subsurface objects, such as tree roots and buried garbage, it can cause the rototiller to abruptly and violently move in an unexpected direction. ; Rotavator: Unlike the Rototiller, the self-propelled Howard Rotavator is equipped with a gearbox and driven forward, or held back, by its wheels. The gearbox enables the forward speed to be adjusted while the rotational speed of the tines remains constant which enables the operator to easily regulate the extent to which soil is engaged. For a two-wheel tractor rotavator this greatly reduces the workload of the operator as compared to a rototiller. These rotavators are generally more heavy duty, come in higher power (4‚Äì18 horsepower or 3‚Äì13 kilowatts) with either petrol or diesel engines and can cover much more area per hour. The trademarked word \\"Rotavator\\" is one of the longest single-word palindromes in the English language. ; Mini tiller: Mini tillers are a new type of small agricultural tillers or cultivators used by farmers or homeowners. These are also known as power tillers or garden tillers. Compact, powerful and, most importantly, inexpensive, these agricultural rotary tillers are providing alternatives to four-wheel tractors and in the small farmers' fields in developing countries are more economical than four-wheel tractors. ; Two-wheel tractor: The higher power \\"riding\\" rotavators cross out of the home garden category into farming category, especially in Europe, capable of preparing 1 hectare of land in 8‚Äì10 hours. These are also known as walk-behind tractors or walking tractors. Years ago they were considered only useful for rice growing areas, where they were fitted with steel cage-wheels for traction, but now the same are being used in both wetland and dryland farming all over the world. They have multiple functions with related tools for dryland or paddys, pumping, transportation, threshing, ditching, spraying pesticide. They can be used on hills, mountains, in greenhouses and orchards.

He was the fourth Bishop and first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Boston, serving between 1866 and his death in 1907. Early life and education Williams was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Michael and Ann (n√©e Egan) Williams, who were Irish immigrants. His father was a blacksmith from Tipperary who came to the United States in 1818. He was raised in a house on Broad Street, and as a child, attended a primary school on Hamilton Street conducted by a Mrs. Newmarch. At the age of five, he became a pupil at the cathedral parochial school. Following the death of his father in 1830, his mother remarried and the family moved to the North End. After displaying an interest in the priesthood, Williams was sent by Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick to study at the Sulpician College in Montreal in 1833. He graduated from there in 1841, and then made his theological studies at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. Priesthood While in Paris, Williams was ordained a priest on May 17, 1845, by Denis Auguste Affre, the Archbishop of Paris who was later killed during the French Revolution of 1848. He returned to Boston in October 1845, and was then assigned as a curate at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. He served in this capacity for ten years, also teaching Sunday school and catechism classes. He was rector of the cathedral from 1855 until 1857, when he became pastor of St. James Church in the same city, where in 1842 he established the first Conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in New England. Under his charge, St. James saw much of its debt relieved and became one of the most important parishes in Boston. In addition to his pastoral duties at St. James, Williams was named Vicar General of the Diocese of Boston in the summer of 1857. He administered the affairs of the diocese during the final years of Bishop John Bernard Fitzpatrick, whose health was in decline. Episcopacy On January 9, 1866, Williams was appointed coadjutor bishop of Boston and titular bishop of Tripolis by Pope Pius IX. However, before arrangements were completed for his episcopal consecration, Bishop Fitzpatrick died and Williams automatically succeeded him as the fourth Bishop of Boston on February 13, 1866. He was consecrated by Archbishop John McCloskey, with Bishops John J. Conroy and John Loughlin serving as co- consecrators, on the following March 11. The Diocese of Springfield was created as a separate diocese in 1870. When the Diocese of Boston was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese on February 12, 1875, Williams became its first Archbishop. Ground was broken for the new, larger Cathedral on April 29, 1866. The rites of dedication were performed in December 1875 by Archbishop Williams. His Jubilee celebration was sung by The Sanctuary Choir of the Cathedral in Boston May 17, 1895 and the book containing the music sung was Published by G. De La Motte in 1895, the Mass was sung in Latin.

The lake is easily accessible from Fredericksburg, Richmond, Charlottesville, Northern Virginia, and Washington, D.C. and is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state. History The reservoir is formed by the North Anna Dam on the North Anna River at . In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (now Dominion) purchased of farmlands in three counties along the North Anna and Pamunkey rivers to provide clean, fresh water to cool the nuclear power generating plants at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station adjacent to the lake.\\"North Anna Power Station\\", Dominion. Accessed on June 30, 2009. By 1972 the lake bottom was cleared of all timber and the dam was nearing completion. It was projected to take three years to completely fill the lake, but with the additional rainfall from Hurricane Agnes, the lake was full in only 18 months. The first communities broke ground at about that same time and now some 120 different communities dot the shores of the lake. In June 1978, the first of the two reactors went into commercial operation. The second unit followed in December 1980. Description Lake Anna is approximately long from tip to tip, with of shoreline. The lake is divided into two sides: the public side (also known as the \\"cold\\" side) and the private side, working as a cooling pond (also known as the \\"hot\\" side). The public side is roughly , while the private side is roughly . The private side is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and private sides are divided by three stone dikes. The private side has no marinas or public access ramps; only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the private side. The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees significantly higher boat traffic than the private side, especially on summer weekends. The public side is known as the \\"cold\\" side because it provides water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or \\"hot\\" side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The private side can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point, where it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters. Preliminary steps toward the addition of a third reactor have raised protests from environmentalists and property owners, who fear an increase in the water temperature and a decrease in the water level, particularly on the private side. According to Dominion, the water discharged from the plant is usually about warmer than the intake water. =North Anna Dam= North Anna Dam The dam creating the lake, North Anna Dam, is a and earthen embankment dam.

He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death. Pius XII never replaced Maglione, opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself, with the assistance of two undersecretaries. Early career and education Born in Casoria, Maglione was educated at the Almo Collegio Capranica and Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained doctorates in philosophy and theology, in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood on 25 July 1901, and then did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Naples until 1903. Maglione studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1905 to 1907; he later taught there from 1915 to 1918. He served an official of the Vatican Secretariat of State from 1908 to 1918, rising to become a Privy Chamberlain (17 June 1910) and a Domestic Prelate (22 February 1918). He was also a provisional papal representative to the League of Nations and a special papal envoy to Switzerland. Nunciatures On 1 September 1920, Maglione was appointed Nuncio to Switzerland and Titular Archbishop of Cesarea di Palestina by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 26 September from Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, with Archbishops Bonaventura Cerretti and Lorenzo Schioppa serving as co-consecrators, in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Archbishop Maglione was later named Apostolic Nuncio to France on 23 June 1926. Upon his arrival in France he was resentfully considered pro-German, but had become so liked by the French Government before he left the post that he was reported to have had a hand in forming the Hoare-Laval Pact during the Italo-Ethiopian War.TIME Magazine. The Triple Tiara 20 March 1939 During his nunciature in France, on 25 July 1930, Maglione ordained Yves Congar to the priesthood. Cardinal Secretary of State Pope Pius XI created him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Pudenziana in the consistory of 16 December 1935, and then Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Council on 22 July 1938. Cardinal Maglione was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. Pius XII, who was a former schoolmate of Maglione's, tapped Maglione to succeed him as Vatican Secretary of State on 10 March 1939. His tenure as Secretary of State included most of World War II and the Holocaust, much of his work being documented in the eleven volumes of the Vatican's wartime documents, Actes et Documents du Saint Si√®ge relatifs √† la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. After falling under Nazi occupation, Lithuania appealed to the Vatican to reintegrate its dioceses into the country and replace its bishops, to which Maglione responded, \\"The government of Kaunas should appreciate, that the Holy See cannot run behind armies and change bishops as combatant troops occupy new territories belonging to countries other than their own.\\"Blet 73 Cardinal Maglione died a year before the war's end in his native Casoria, from neuritis and circulatory ailments. Upon his death, Pius XII assumed the duties of the office himself, with assistance from Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Battista Montini. He vigorously defended Pius XII's wartime diplomacy, once declaring, \\"If you ask why the documents sent by the Pontiff to the Polish bishops have not been made public, know that it seems better in the Vatican to follow the same norms, the Polish bishops themselves follow...Isn‚Äôt this what has to be done? Should the father of Christianity increase the misfortunes of Poles in their own country?\\"Blet 84 The relationship between Maglione and the Pontiff was so close that Italians were known to joke that whenever Pius XII went out without his maglione (Italian for \\"sweater\\"), he caught cold.TIME Magazine.

In reference to his first recording, he is known as \\"The Sheik of Scrubby Creek\\". Biography Morgan was born in Wondai, Queensland, the eldest of 14 children to Dave and Ivy Morgan. From an early age he was raised by his grandparents, Bill and Eva Hopkins. After his grandfather died in 1945, he and his grandmother moved back to Scrubby Creek to live with his parents and siblings. Morgan left school at age 12 and found work cutting timber. Morgan was discovered through Australia's Amateur Hour, a radio talent contest, where he sang his original song \\"The Sheik of Scrubby Creek\\" and was a finalist. He began recording with Regal Zonophone Records (a subsidiary of EMI) in 1952, while completing his national service obligation in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Morgan's songs are peppered with Australian slang; one CD compilation is called Sheilas, Drongos, Dills and Geezers. Morgan's first wife was Pam Mitchell, with whom he had three children - Allan, Chad Jr. and Janelle. Morgan married again on 14 September 1985 to Joanie, whom he had met the year before. After their marriage Morgan gave up drinking and smoking completely. Morgan has toured extensively, including with the Slim Dusty Show, the All Star Western Show and his own Chad Morgan Show. He has been prolific in his recorded output and live performances. In 1987 Morgan was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown, and was awarded an OAM in 2004. Morgan has appeared in three films, Newsfront (1978), Dimboola (1979), and the biographical documentary I'm Not Dead Yet (2011). Morgan contributed one verse to the Gordon Parsons song \\"Pub With No Beer\\". He was dubbed the \\"clown prince of comedy\\" by Slim Dusty. He recorded a duet with John Williamson, \\"A Country Balladeer\\". He has had platinum and gold album sales and is one of Australia's most popular country music artists. Morgan performed at Sydney Opera House with Slim Dusty in April 1978. An album of the concert was released three years later, as On & Off The Road. It was released the same year as Sheilas Drongos Dills & Other Geezers which contained 20 of Morgan's hits from the 1950s and 1960s.

It is the sequel to 1994's Sega Rally Championship. The game was first released in arcades in February 1998, and was later ported by Smilebit to the Sega Dreamcast, becoming one of the console's earliest titles when it was released in Japan on January 28, 1999. The Sega Dreamcast version was released in Europe as a launch title on October 14, 1999, and then in North America on November 27, 1999. A PC version was released in Japan and Europe that same year, with the North American release following suit in September 2000. Gameplay As with the predecessor, Sega Rally Championship, the object of the game is to successfully drive along a track while reaching checkpoints and thus be rewarded with more time to enable the player to reach the goal. Sega Rally 2 added new vehicles, new environment settings for the circuits (including snowy tracks and a course set on an island), as well as including multiple circuits in each environment type. An updated version of the original game's Desert track was also included. The Dreamcast and PC versions of the game also included a \\"10-year championship\\" mode. The Dreamcast version ported using Windows CE, had a frame rate half that of the arcade version. The Toyota Celica GT-Four ST-205, Lancia Delta HF Integrale and the unlockable Lancia Stratos HF returned from the original game as selectable cars, along with newer Toyota and Lancia cars, as well as cars from Mitsubishi, Subaru, Fiat, Peugeot, Renault, and Ford (which is not available in the European and North American copies of the Dreamcast game). Reception The game received favorable reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Colin Williamson of AllGame gave the arcade version four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \\"Though the replay value isn't phenomenal, Sega Rally 2 offers a one-of-a-kind racing experience that's seldom been matched in the arcade. You owe it to yourself to climb into the driver's seat and try this out at least once.\\" Jeff Lundrigan of Next Generation said in its January 2000 issue that the Dreamcast version \\"is not the sort of game you beat. Instead, it beats you.\\" A year later, in its January 2001 issue, Jim Preston called the PC version \\"A fun and pretty arcade rally game that redirects the blood from your brain to your foot.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version a score of 36 out of 40. Also in Japan, Game Machine listed Sega Rally 2 on their April 15, 1998 issue as being the most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year.

His approach to natural landscape design can clearly be seen in projects including the Grand Rounds in Minneapolis; Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts; the boulevard system in Omaha, Nebraska; Roger Williams Park in Providence, Rhode Island; and St. Anthony Park in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  Life  An undated image of Cleveland in his younger years Horace William Shaler Cleveland was born to Richard Jeffry Cleveland and Dorcas Cleveland on December 16, 1814, in Lancaster, Massachusetts. Horace was later educated at the Lancaster School, a Unitarian school organized by his parents in accordance with the theories of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746‚Äì1827). The school emphasized frequent excursions for direct observation and study of nature through drawing and map-making. The family was socially linked to philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson through Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Horatio Greenough, and one of Emerson's cousins. As a result, Transcendentalism strongly influenced Cleveland's upbringing. In the late 1820s Richard Cleveland moved his family to Cuba, where Horace's father served as Vice-Consul in Havana. Horace returned to the United States in the 1830s. During this time he was employed as a railroad surveyor in Illinois. While in Illinois, Cleveland studied civil engineering. A few years later, in the late 1830s, Cleveland returned to Massachusetts. In 1841 Cleveland left Massachusetts to purchase a farm on the Delaware River in Burlington, New Jersey, where he became a scientific farmer. He joined horticultural societies, and became corresponding secretary of the New Jersey Horticultural Society. Cleveland also wrote articles for the Horticulturist, a periodical edited by renowned landscape gardener, architect, and horticulturist Andrew Jackson Downing (Wilson). In 1854, at the age of 40, Cleveland returned to Massachusetts to establish the Cleveland and Copeland landscape practice in Boston with partner Robert Morris Copeland. Their first job was the design of the State Farm at Westborough, Massachusetts, followed by Cleveland's first major design, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts (1855). The town report in Concord shows they were paid $75 for their work on the cemetery. Cleveland also assisted in the design of Boston's park spaces, emphasizing his famous concepts of open spaces and interconnected byways. In 1857 Cleveland and Copeland entered a competition to be the designers for Central Park in New York. They lost the competition to another duo, landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmsted and his partner, Calvert Vaux, an architect. Cleveland's and Copeland's design of Central Park was not unlike that of Olmsted and Vaux's. \\"In a pamphlet accompanying his design Cleveland wrote, 'The tract of land selected for the Central Park comprises such an extensive area and such variety of surface as to afford opportunity for the construction of a work which shall surpass everything of its kind in the world ...'. Cleveland, like Olmsted, prescribed broad lawns, undulating surfaces, clothed with the rich verdure, dotted here and there with graceful trees and bounded by projecting capes and islands of wood ...'\\" (Oxford). Later in 1857, Cleveland designed Eastwood Cemetery (1872) in Lancaster, Massachusetts, with his son. Cleveland and Copeland parted ways during the Civil War when Copeland joined the war. After the war Copeland started his own practice which continued to grow till his death in 1872. Cleveland moved to Chicago in 1869 and opened his own landscaping firm. Throughout his career he designed major parks and private landscapes in Illinois, Minneapolis, and throughout the Midwest. This included Highland Park, Illinois (1869). In 1872, Cleveland was retained by the city of Chicago to rebuild South Park, originally designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, after the great Chicago fire. Cleveland wrote his landscaping guide, Landscape Architecture as Applied to the Wants of the West, in 1873 and was afterward hired by William Rainey Marshall to design Saint Anthony Park, a neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota. From 1878 until his death in 1900, Horace Cleveland not only completely revised the park systems of Minneapolis and St. Paul, but lent his extensive knowledge of landscaping to numerous projects, completing his last major project, landscaping for the campus at the University of Minnesota, in 1892. He died on December 5, 1900, in Hinsdale, Illinois. His body was returned to Minneapolis and is buried in Lakewood Cemetery.  Philosophy  The cover of Cleveland's Landscape Architecture As Applied to the Wants of the West Cleveland was a preservationist by nature, respecting the natural landscape features around him and shunning unnecessary decoration. Believing that a growing population would make open spaces like parks all the more valuable and desirable, Cleveland wrote that, to be successful in the landscape architecture field, one must \\"Look forward a century, to the time when the city has a population of a million, and think what will be their wants.\\" Essentially, he believed that a good landscape architect should look to the future in order to design sustainable landscapes in the here and now, and that landscape architects should speak openly against the destruction of natural landscapes, to make sure that they would be available for future generations to enjoy. Cleveland was a believer of using the existing topography and existing plants to keep his designs as natural as possible. In 1881 Cleveland wrote a book entitled A Few Words on the Arrangement of Rural Cemeteries. In his book, Cleveland wrote critically of cemetery layouts. He wrote, \\"without the least regard to topographical features, or the opportunities for tasteful effects which the natural position may afford.\\" In his 1880s design for the grounds of the Jekyll Island Club, Cleveland promised Club owners a \\"style of severe simplicity,\\" but this simplicity would be \\"the result of careful study\\" aimed at turning the Club grounds into \\"a Natural Paradise.\\" With this goal in mind, Cleveland laid out lots and roads so as not to disturb \\"the favored haunts of deer and wild fowl\\" and stressing the preservation of native vegetation. In addition, he believed that designs for public projects should not be limited by the financial or physical means of the designer or the commissioner. He theorized that, when the proposition of a new park or parkway came about, natural opposition was to be expected from the public. He knew this because he understood that the general populace saw outdoor city projects as a source of needless taxation for them, and that they did not believe that they could benefit from a public park in the same capacity as the wealthy. Eliminating this belief and creating parks that were meant to be enjoyed by all became one of Cleveland's most important endeavors. In 1873 Cleveland wrote Landscape Architecture As Applied to the Wants of the West. This book is known as one of the first definitive attempts to describe on a broader scope the profession of landscape architecture. In its preface he wrote: :The term ‚ÄúLandscape Architecture‚Äù is objectionable, as being only figuratively expressive of the art it is used to designate. I make use of it, under protest, as the readiest means of making myself understood, in the absence of a more appropriate term. If the art is ever developed to the extent I believe to be within its legitimate limits, it will achieve for itself a name worthy of its position. Until it does so, it is idle to attempt to exalt it in the world‚Äôs estimation, by giving it a high-sounding title. Major landscape projects The Fergus Falls State Hospital's exterior, circa 1915 In the 1880s, Cleveland was hired by the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners to create a series of parks and interconnected parkways to connect and preserve existing natural features in and near the city. The parkways along the Mississippi River gorge were his main interest, but his plan also showed parkway boulevards across town and around one of the lakes in South Minneapolis, Lake Harriet. These grand parkways would increase property values, connect larger parks, drive up the desire for private development, and hopefully increase general revenues in the city over time. This vision was expanded by subsequent park commissioners and superintendents to encircle a series of lakes, now known as the Chain of Lakes, and to follow Minnehaha Creek to Minnehaha Falls. The result of Cleveland's vision is the famous ‚ÄúGrand Rounds,‚Äù an interconnected series of parkways, and parks, centered on the Mississippi River. The official title ‚ÄúGrand Rounds,‚Äù came much later, but Cleveland's vision for the scenic byway is timeless, and the Minneapolis Grand Rounds are known today as one of the best urban park systems in the world. Plans for a similar system in St. Paul, would have connected it to the Minneapolis system, but they were never completed, with the exception of the parkways along the Mississippi River. In 2017, the City of St. Paul began a several year project to complete its Grand Rounds system. In 1889, the park commissioners for the city of Omaha sought Cleveland's advice in designing a large park in the center of the city. Cleveland stated that the center of any large park system, including the one intended for this city, should include a ‚Äúgreat central park‚Äù that blocked the sights and sounds of the city. Cleveland advised that the park commissioners purchase a lot no less than in size, and that it should be situated many miles away from the heavily populated city districts. Other major projects included: *1854: Cleveland partners with Robert Morris Copeland. Cleveland and Copeland design Oak Grove Cemetery in Gloucester, Massachusetts. *1855: Cleveland and Copeland design Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts. *1873: Cleveland receives honorary professorship title. Although he never attended any university, his own educational and professional knowledge led to his being addressed as ‚ÄúProfessor H. Cleveland.‚Äù Cleveland publishes Landscape Architecture as Applied to the Wants of the West. *1878: Designed the Roger Williams Park/New England Botanical Gardens in Providence, Rhode Island. Designed the Cleveland Arboretums in Cleveland, Ohio. Designed Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis. *1881: Cleveland publishes A Few Words on the Arrangement of Rural Cemeteries. *1886: Created the Blackstone Boulevard in Providence, Rhode Island, which connected Blackstone Park, Butler Hospital, and the Swan Point Cemetery. *1886: Designed a landscape plan for the Jekyll Island Club, on Jekyll Island, Georgia. A winter resort for northeastern millionaires designed to stress natural simplicity. *1890s: Designed the landscaping for the Fergus Falls State Hospital in Fergus Falls, Minnesota and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Leavenworth, Kansas. * 1892: Landscaped the campus for the University of Minnesota. Designed the parks and boulevards system in Omaha, Nebraska that still guides the city today. * 1898: Cleveland presents a paper on \\"The Influence of Parks on the Character of Children.\\"  Social movements and influence over time  A path on Minneapolis's Grand Rounds Cleveland's most important social movement could arguably be his contribution to the Minneapolis park systems. In lending his unique touch to these parks and scenic byways, Cleveland established a park system that embodied his philosophy of open spaces, naturalistic design, and the importance of preserving these public spaces for future generations. In the words of Cleveland himself: ‚ÄúThey [the wealthy elite] will have wealth enough to purchase all that money can buy, but all their wealth cannot purchase a lost opportunity, or restore natural features of grandeur and beauty, which would then possess priceless value‚Ä¶‚Äù In this way, Cleveland inspired future generations of landscape architects to think before tearing down the natural landscape. In addition, he stated that landscape architecture involved not just ‚Äúdecorating‚Äù the landscape, but that it was a landscape architect's duty to design parks, residential and commercial landscapes always with careful consideration to the environment around them and to be ever mindful of how future generations would make use of them. It is evident that Horace Cleveland contributed much to the future of landscape architecture and to the pursuit for a more naturalistic landscape concept. Cleveland's designs in the mid-to- late 19th century shaped the future of all park systems for Minneapolis and St. Paul. Metropolitan Council Chair Peter Bell reflected on the contributions of Horace Cleveland: ‚ÄúImagine this metropolitan area had it not been for the Minneapolis Board of Park Commissioners and landscape architect Horace Cleveland. Their vision 100 years ago helped create a network of scenic drives, parks and river boulevards along the lakes and rivers in Minneapolis and St. Paul, now recognized as one of the best urban park systems in the world.‚Äù Publications  Notes References *Cleveland, Horace W.S. 1873.

Biography Avigdor Arikha (originally Victor D≈Çugacz) was born to German- speaking Jewish parents in RƒÉdƒÉu≈£i, but grew up in Czernowitz in Bukovina, Romania (now in Ukraine). His family faced forced deportation in 1941 to the Romanian-run concentration camps of Transnistria, where his father died. He survived thanks to the drawings he made of deportation scenes, which were shown to delegates of the International Red Cross. Arikha immigrated to Palestine in 1944, together with his sister. Until 1948, he lived in Kibbutz Ma'ale HaHamisha. In 1948 he was severely wounded in 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. From 1946 to 1949, he attended the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem. In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, where he learned the fresco technique. From 1954, Arikha resided in Paris. Arikha was married from 1961 until his death to the American poet and writer Anne Atik, with whom he had two daughters. Arikha died in Paris on April 29, 2010, the day after his 81st birthday. Artistic career In the late 1950s, Arikha established himself as an abstract painter, but he eventually came to think of abstraction as a dead end. In 1965 he stopped painting and began drawing, only from life, treating all subjects in a single sitting. He engaged in drawing and printmaking only for the next eight years. In 1973, he resumed painting and became \\"perhaps the best painter from life in the last decades of the 20th century\\", as he was hailed in an obituary in Economist magazine. Arikha painted directly from the subject in natural light only, using no preliminary drawing, finishing a painting, pastel, print, ink, or drawing in one session. His profound knowledge of art techniques and masterly draughtsmanship enabled him to abide by this principle of immediacy, partly inspired by Chinese brush painting. It was a principle he shared with his close friend Henri Cartier- Bresson, to whose \\"instant d√©cisif\\" it was analogous. He never drew from memory or photographs, aiming to depict the truth of what lay before his eyes at that moment. He is noted for his portraits, nudes, still lifes, and landscapes, rendered realistically and spontaneously. In their radical spatial composition, his work clearly harks back to abstraction, and in particular Mondrian. Arikha painted a number of commissioned portraits, including that of H.M. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (1983), Lord Home of the Hirsel, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1988), both in the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Other portraits include those of Catherine Deneuve (1990) for the French State, or that of the former Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy for the city of Lille. Arikha also illustrated texts by Samuel Beckett, with whom he maintained a close friendship until the writer's death. Artistic style Art critic Marco Livingstone wrote that Arikha \\"bridged the modernist avant-garde of pure abstraction with traditions of observational drawing and painting stretching back to the Renaissance and beyond. He was truculently insistent that he was not part of any \\"return to figuration\\", but rather had found his own way as \\"a post-abstract representational artist\\".\\" Art catalogues and public speaking As an art historian, Arikha wrote catalogues for exhibitions on Poussin and Ingres for which he was curator at the Mus√©e du Louvre, the Frick Collection of New York, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. His writings include Ingres, Fifty Life Drawings (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston/Frick Collection, New York, 1986); Peinture et Regard (Paris: Hermann, 1991, 1994; new, augmented edition 2011); On Depiction (London: Bellew Publishing, 1995); and numerous essays published in such journals as the New York Review of Books, The New Republic, Commentaire, Literary Imagination, etc. He was invited to speak at Princeton University, Yale University, the Frick Collection in New York, and the Prado Museum in Madrid. In 2006, he was invited by the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid to select a number of works from its collection and write entries for the exhibit catalogue. Exhibits Arikha showed frequently (every two years, in London and New York) at the gallery that represented him from 1972, Marlborough, and over the decades he had over two dozen solo shows. In 1998 Arikha had a major retrospective at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (of paintings) and at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (of prints and drawings), which travelled to Edinburgh's Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 1999. From July 2006 ‚Äì January 2007 there was an exhibition at the British Museum of Arikha's bequest to it of one hundred prints and drawings. There was a retrospective of his prints at the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris in 2008. From June to September 2008 the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid hosted another retrospective exhibition of the artist. The Estate of Avigdor Arikha has been represented by Blain Southern since 2018, with the first exhibition of landscapes in Berlin. In June 2019, 50 of Arikha‚Äôs works were exhibited in a retrospective of his work at the Benaki Museum in Athens.

The aim of the servicescapes model is to explain behavior of people within the service environment with a view to designing environments that does not accomplish organisational goals in terms of achieving desired behavioural responses. For consumers visiting a service or retail store, the service environment is the first aspect of the service that is perceived by the customer and it is at this stage that consumers are likely to form impressions of the level of service they will receive. Booms and Bitner defined a servicescape as \\"the environment in which the service is assembled and in which the seller and customer interact, combined with tangible commodities that facilitate performance or communication of the service\\". In other words, the servicescape refers to the non-human elements of the environment in which service encounters occur. The servicescape does not include: processes (e.g. methods of payment, billing, cooking, cleaning); external promotions (e.g. advertising, PR, social media, web-sites) or back-of-house (kitchen, cellars, store-rooms, housekeeping, staff change rooms), that is; spaces where customers do not normally visit. The servicescape includes the appearance, equipment, signage and layout of a service outlet. The servicescape includes the facility's exterior (landscape, exterior design, signage, parking, surrounding environment) and interior (interior design and decor, equipment, signage, layout) and ambient conditions (air quality, temperature and lighting). In addition to its effects on customer's individual behaviors, the servicescape influences the nature and quality of customer and employee interactions, most directly in interpersonal services. Companies design their servicescapes to add an atmosphere that enhances the customer experience and that will affect buyers' behavior during the service encounter. Origins, importance and influences The servicescapes model is an applied stimulus- response model where the application is specific to the service sector. The model was developed by US academic, Mary Jo Bitner in 1990. It is heavily influenced by a branch of social science known as environmental psychology. In services marketing, the servicescapes model has become the dominant framework for studying and evaluating the physical environment in which service encounters occur. A service encounter can be defined as \\"the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment.\\" Furnham, A.and Milner, R., \\"The Impact of Mood on Customer Behavior: Staff Mood and Environmental Factors,\\" Journal of Retail and Consumer Services, Vo. 20, 2013, p. 634 According to Lusch and Vargo, the servicescape is an important resource that enables the firm to \\"channel consumer realities in certain ways\\".Lusch, R.F. and Vargo, S.L., The Service-dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions, Oxon, Routledge, 2015, p. 96 Empirical studies have demonstrated that the servicescape affects both the customer's emotional and behavioural responses in service settings.Mutum, D.S., \\"Introduction to Service Branding and Servicescapes,\\" in Services Marketing Cases in Emerging Markets: An Asian Perspective, Roy, Sanjit Kumar, Mutum, Dilip S., Nguyen, Bang (eds), Springer, 2015, pp 63-65, The servicescapes model seeks to describe all the customer interactions that occur during a service encounter and to understand how environmental elements impact on the customer's service experience. =The stimulus-response model= The SOR model (stimulus‚Üíorganism‚Üíresponse model) describes the way that organisms, including customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli (e.g. lighting, music, interior-design). In essence, the model proposes that people's responses exhibit three broad types of responses to stimuli in the external environment - physiological, emotional (affective) and behavioural responses. :::: A simple stimulus-organism-response model :::: Stimulus (physical environment) ‚Üí Organism (customers & employees) ‚Üí Response (comfort, pleasure, etc) =Environmental psychology= A simplified environmental psychology model Environmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual's emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.Donovan and Rossiter, J., \\"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\\" Journal of Retailing, Vol;. 58, no. 1, 1982, pp 34-57 Three emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualised as falling anywhere along the continuum as shown in the diagram.Ridgway, Dawson and Bloch (1990) \\"Pleasure and Arousal in the Marketplace: Interpersonal differences in approach-avoidance responses,\\" Marketing Letters, vol 1, no 2, pp139-47 :Pleasure‚Äìdispleasure refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience. :Arousal‚Äìnon-arousal refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated. :Dominance‚Äìsubmissiveness refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment. Environments that are simple and well-organised are said to be 'low load'. The individual's emotional response mediate the individual's behavioural response of Approach‚Üí Avoidance. Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people's ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterised by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place \\"looks inviting\\" or \\"gives off good vibes\\". The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal, however, can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings. Mehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:Mehrabian, A. and Russell, J.A., An Approach to Environmental Psychology, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press : High load: Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load. Such environments tend to make people feel alert and stimulated. : Low load: Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organised are low load. Such environments tend to make people feel relaxed, calm and even sleepy. Activities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed is relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment.  The servicescapes model Simplified servicescapes model The servicescapes model is an applied stimulus-organism- response model (SOR model), which treats the physical environment as the stimulus and the response is the behavior of employees and customers within the physical environment.Bitner, M.J., \\"Evaluating Service Encounters: The Effects of Physical Surroundings and Employee Responses,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 54, no. 2, 1990, pp 69-82 The servicescape performs four important roles - packaging - presents the outward appearance to the public; facilitator - guides the efficient flow of activities; socialiser - conveys expected roles to both employees and customers and differentiator - serves as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organisation and conveying competitive difference.Bitner, M.J., \\"The Servicescape,\\" in Handbook of Services Marketing and Management, Swartz, R. and Iacobucci, D. (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, pp 37-49 =Physical environment as stimuli= The elements of the physical environment itself make up the inputs (stimuli). Environmental inputs are sensory, spatial and symbolic.Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J., \\"Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach,\\" in Bateson, J.E.G., Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings, Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227-243 For convenience, these elements are normally considered as three broad categories including: : Ambient conditions: Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc. : Space/Function: Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc. and the ways that these elements are arranged within the space : Signs, symbols and artefacts: Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of d√©cor (including colour schemes), symbols, etc. Each element in the physical environment serves multiple purposes. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating where patrons can wait for friends or simply enjoy a quiet rest, but the construction materials may also serve a symbolic role in which they communicate meaning through shared understandings. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may signify an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration. The functional seating, ceiling mounted projectors, whiteboard, fluorescent lighting and schoolroom layout clearly signal that this space is part of an educational environment. Ambient Conditions Ambient conditions refer to the controllable, observable stimuli such as air temperature, lighting and noise. Ambient factors, such as music used in servicescapes, have been found to influence consumer behaviors. One study found that \\"positively valenced music [joyful] will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced [mournful] music \\", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music. In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow. Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction.Hul, M.K., Dube, L. and Chebat, J-C., \\" The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services,\\" Journal of Retailing, Vol. 73, no. 1, 1997, pp 87-104 Spatial layout According to Zeithaml et al., layout affects how easy or difficult it is to navigate through a system. Two important aspects of layout are functionality and spatial layout. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the customer's goals while spatial layout refers to how physical elements are arranged, the size of those objects and the spatial arrangements between them.Zeithaml, V. A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D., Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm, 5th ed., Boston, MA, McGraw Hill, 2009 With respect to functionality of layout, designers consider three key issues; circulation ‚Äì design for traffic- flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination ‚Äì design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience ‚Äì design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.Aghazadeh, S., \\"Layout Strategies for Retail Operations: A Case Study, \\" Management Research News, Vol. 28, no. 10, 2005, pp.31-46 Spatial layout is closely related to space utilisation. Some research suggests that customers associate more spacious surroundings with higher quality services.Lam, L.W., Chan, K.W. and Fong, D., \\"Does the Look Matter? The Impact of Casino Servicescape on Gaming Customer Satisfaction, Intention to Revisit, and Desire to Stay,\\" International Journal of Hospitality Management, Vol. 30, 2011, pp 558‚Äì567 A selection of souvenirs from the Minsk Puppet Theatre. Souvenirs, or artefacts, are part of the servicescape  Signs, symbols and artifacts Signs, symbols and artifacts refer to a broader category of objects that serve multiple purposes. Signs and symbol refer to physical signals that provide cues for directional purposes, provide information about appropriate behavior within a store or servicescape and may also serve a symbolic role. Some signs perform rudimentary roles such as providing directions for navigation through a space while other more complex signs that communicate through shared meaning systems. Physical environment elements not only serve a functional or utilitarian role, but they communicate meaning in very subtle ways through symbolism. In an office environment, a big desk can symbolize the manager's power, and this can have the potential to make those who sit on the opposite side of the desk feel less relaxed and less willing to speak out.Detert, J.R. and Burris, E.R., \\"Can Your Employees Really Speak Freely?\\" Harvard Business Review, January‚ÄìFebruary, 2016 The use of color also communicates at a symbolic level in ways that impact on behavior.Nilsson, E and Ballantyne, D., \\"Reexamining the Place of Servicescape in Marketing: A Service-Dominant Logic Perspective,\\" Journal of Services Marketing, Vol. 28, no. 5, 2014, DOI: 10.1108/JSM-01-2013-0004 Artifacts refer to objects that hold some type of cultural, historical or social interest for customers. They are the tangible reminders of the service experienced by consumers. Artifacts may be purpose- designed objects that serve as souvenirs or mementos of a pleasant experience. Many services, such as museums, galleries, theater's and tourist attractions, manufacture artifacts that form the basis of a merchandise collection, available for sale to visitors and guests. These artifacts, more commonly known as souvenirs, can often be retailed at prices well above market value because of the memory consumers attach to the experiential encounter.Ardley, B., Taylor, N., McLintock, E., Martin, F. and Leonard, G., \\"Marketing a Memory of the World: Magna Carta and the Experiential Servicescape,\\" Marketing Intelligence and Planning, Vol. 30, no. 6, pp.653-665, doi: 10.1108/02634501211262618 =The holistic environment= Mood lighting, crisp, starched napery, polished brass and comfortable seating combine to communicate an image of an upscale dining establishment. When consumers enter a servicescape, they process multiple stimuli almost simultaneously. Consumers scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall impression of the environment. In other words, the holistic environment is the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single impression. In the servicescapes model, this type of impression is known as the holistic environment.Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J. E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases, Asia-Pacific Edition, Cengage Learning Australia, 2010, pp 209-215 Through careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm's values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time. =Customers and employees= The organism dimension refers to the two groups of people that make up the service encounter ‚Äì customers and employees. Both groups inhabit the same physical environment, yet their perceptions of it may vary because each comes to the space for different reasons. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience. =Internal response moderators and mediators= A moderator is any variable with the potential to change the relationship between a dependent and independent variable. Moderating variables describe what effects will hold in certain conditions. A mediator is an intervening variable that helps to explain the relationship between two variables.University of Wisconsin, Psychology Department, \\"Mediator vs Moderator\\" In the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that increases the standard stimulus-response states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the response behaviour is mediated by internal responses including the cognitive, emotional and physiological responses.Hoffman, K.D. and Bateson, J.E. G., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, & Cases, Cengage, 2017, p. 215 The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment.Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 64-65 For instance, a consumer who walks into a slightly chilly room, may shiver and feel a little uncomfortable. Faced with such a situation, the consumer may respond in various ways ‚Äì some consumers will choose to add another layer of clothing, others will leave the environment as soon as practical, while yet others may simply endure the minor discomfort. If the consumer has a strong motivation for being in the environment, he or she is more likely to suffer the minor inconvenience of an uncomfortable ambient temperature. Thus, the consumer's motivation or reason for being in the servicescape mediates the ultimate behavioural response. =Behavioural responses= Navigational floor signs are commonly used in elaborate servicescapes such as shopping malls, hospitals and institutions. The model shows that there are different types of response - individual response (approach and avoid) and interaction responses (e.g.social interactions). In the context of servicescapes, approach has a special meaning. It refers to how customers use the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 60-63 : Enter and explore ‚Äì exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company's products and services; showing an interest in cross-selling opportunities as presented :Stay longer ‚Äì exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up- selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure :Carry out plan ‚Äì exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals Approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter include: :Affiliation ‚Äì A willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit :Commitment ‚Äì The formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide positive recommendations, write favourable reviews or give positive word-of-mouth referrals Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. :Social interactions refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialise. Types Environments with multiple spaces and rich in physical elements are said to be 'elaborate' servicescapes. Bitner's pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 58-59 : Lean servicescapes - environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward : Elaborate servicescapes- environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision. According to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a \\"product's package\\" - by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service.Bitner, M.J., \\"Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees,\\" Journal of Marketing, vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, p. 67 See also References Category:Business terms Category:Customer service Category:Services marketing ","title":"Servicescape"},{"id":"1909364","title":"Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)"},{"id":"1909365","text":"Butigeidis (Budikid; ) was the Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1285 to 1291.

Kwun Tong District borders Sai Kung District to the east, Wong Tai Sin District to the north, and Kowloon City District to the west. To the south is Victoria Harbour, and the Eastern District directly across on Hong Kong Island. It is the most densely populated district in Hong Kong, at 55,000 per km¬≤, but it is also one of the largest industrial areas in Hong Kong. Kwun Tong District is known for its industry, with factories built during the 1950s; they were mainly located in Kowloon Bay, Kwun Tong, and Yau Tong. Since the relocation of the manufacturing industry, Kwun Tong district has seen a rise of commercial buildings, such as APM Millennium City 5. Kwun Tong is served by six stations on the Kwun Tong Line: Yau Tong (also on the Tseung Kwan O Line), Lam Tin, Kwun Tong, Ngau Tau Kok and Kowloon Bay. Pollution, poverty and ageing population remain concerns for the district. According to a statistical figures of 2001, the proportion of poor and elderly people in this district is 22.6% and 15.5% respectively. Furthermore, the number of poor people living in this district is 124,803, which is the highest in Hong Kong. Areas The district consists of the following areas: * Kwun Tong () * Ngau Tau Kok () * Kowloon Bay () * Sau Mau Ping () * Lam Tin () * Yau Tong () and Lei Yue Mun () Features =Industrial area= Kwun Tong District is one of the industrial areas in Hong Kong. The factories had been built since the 1950s. These industrial areas are mainly located in Kowloon Bay, Kwun Tong (to the southwest of Kwun Tong Road), and Yau Tong. Since the importance of manufacturing in Hong Kong is fading out, many factories have been demolished and commercial buildings are being constructed to replace them. =APM Millennium City 5= Opened in Hong Kong in April 2005, APM Millennium City 5 is a commercial property developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties. Together with Millennium Cities 1, 2, 3, and 6, they are commercial properties situated along Kwun Tong Road. apm Millennium City 5 is next to the Kwun Tong MTR Station. There is also a 7-storey shopping arcade with an array of restaurants, clothing stores, cosmetics shops, and a cineplex. It also contains a bus terminus and parking facilities. It is the largest mall in the district, and caters for the habits of the community by having extended operating hours. Its name 'apm' implies that visitors are welcome during day (am) and night (pm). In fact, many shops inside the mall are open overnight. Some retail shops close at 12 midnight, and restaurants close at 2am. There are also stores that operate 24 hours. =Residential area= The residential areas in Kwun Tong are mainly located in Ngau Tau Kok, upper Kwun Tong Central, Sau Mau Ping and Lam Tin. Around 54% of the population of the Kwun Tong District live in public housing estates, 13% in the Home Ownership Scheme estates, 4% in the Private Sector Participation Scheme estates, and the rest in private housing. With the redevelopment schemes of housing estates being completed successively in recent years, many older estates have been replaced by new ones, and this scenario gives a fresh look to the amenities of the District. =Health care= The supply and demand of medical and health services in Kwun Tong are all very stringent, and especially the accident and emergency services are provided by the United Christian Hospital which is the only hospital in the District equipped with casualty facilities. In the event of accidents and disasters, the injured have to be sent there for emergency medical treatment. In addition, various health services are provided by the Department of Health in the District, including an elderly health centre, a woman health centre, a chest clinic, a child assessment centre, a dermatological clinic, a dental out-patient clinic, a school dental clinic, a social hygiene clinic, two maternal and child health care centres, two methadone clinics and three student health service centres/special assessment centres. =Recreational facilities= There are nine community centres under the District Office, and they are distributed over the 8 sub-districts of the Kwun Tong District. The oldest one is the Kwun Tong Community Centre, which is already 34 years old, while the newest one is the Sai Tso Wan Neighbourhood Community Centre. The construction of the Centre, which was completed in 1993, is the ancillary requirement that Laguna City developer has to fulfil for property development therein. Transport Kwun Tong is served by the Kwun Tong Line (six stations) and the Tseung Kwan O Line (one station) of the MTR metro system. Major roads that serves the area include: * Kwun Tong Road * Kwun Tong Bypass * Tseung Kwan O Tunnel * Eastern Harbour Crossing (EHC) =Public transport= * MTR ** Kwun Tong Line: Yau Tong, Lam Tin, Kwun Tong, Ngau Tau Kok, Kowloon Bay ** Tseung Kwan O Line: Yau Tong * (franchised) bus ** KMB : 1A, 2A, 3D, 6D, 9, 11B, 11C, 11D, 11X, 13D, 13M, 13X, 14, 14B, 14X, 15, 15A, 15X, 16, 16M, 17, 23, 23M, 24, 26, 26M, 27, 28, 29M, 38, 40, 42, 42C, 62X, 74A, 74X, 80, 80X, 83X, 89, 89B, 89C, 89D, 89X, 91, 91M, 92, 93A, 93K, 95, 95M, 98A, 98C, 98D, 213M, 213S, 214, 215X, 216M, 219X, 224X, 258D, 259D, 268C, 269C, 277X, 296A, 296C, 296D, 297, N216 ** NWFB : 796S, 796X, N796 ** CityBus : A22, A29, E22, E22A, N26, N29 ** Harbour-crossing routes : 101/R, 107, 111, 601/P, 603/S/P, 606/A/X, 619/P, 671, 690/P, 692P, 694, N619, N691 * Minibus / Public Light Bus ** Green Minibus *** to-and-fro Kowloon : 16, 16A, 16B, 22M, 23, 23B, 23C, 23M, 24, 34M, 35, 36A, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51M, 54, 54S, 56, 59, 60, 63, 63M, 68, 69, 71A, 71B, 76A, 76B *** to-and-fro New Territories (Tseung Kwan O) : 10M, 12, 13, 17, 18, 102, 102B, 103, 104, 106, 108M, 110, 111 ** Red Minibus *** There are about 28 routes, some travel throughout the district, while others goes to-and-fro Mong Kok, Castle Peak Road, Jordan Road, Hung Hom etc. * Ferry : Kwun Tong Pier ** Fortune Ferry operates a regular service between Kwun Tong and North Point. ** Coral Sea Ferry operates a regular service between Kwun Tong and Sai Wan Ho. *only full- day operated routes are listed above.

He served as a delegate for New Jersey to the Continental Congress, where he was one of two delegates from New Jersey to sign the Articles of Confederation. Biography Nathaniel was born in Monmouth Court House, Province of New Jersey, which later became Freehold Borough, New Jersey. He attended the College Of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and graduated in 1751. He then studied medicine before setting up a practice in Monmouth County, New Jersey. His home site is now within the Borough of Freehold. Dr. Scudder was active in civic and militia affairs. When the revolution split the colonies, he supported the rebel cause. He was a member of the county's Committee of Safety, and represented it in the Provincial Congress held in 1774. That same year he was named lieutenant colonel in the county's first regiment of militia. In 1776 he was elected to a one-year term as Monmouth County's first member of the newly constituted New Jersey Legislative Council, and in 1780 he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly.Manual of the Legislature of New Jersey, 1914; Thomas F. Fitzgerald In 1777, Scudder became the colonel of his militia regiment and that fall was sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress. During the summer of 1778, he was particularly busy and finally abandoned his medical practice altogether. He split his time between the Congress and militia activities. He led his regiment in the Battle of Monmouth in June. He wrote a series of impassioned letters to local and state leaders urging the adoption of the Articles of Confederation and, when New Jersey's legislature approved them in November, he endorsed them for the state at the Congress. Scudder continued both forms of service for several years. Finally, on October 17, 1781, he led a part of his regiment to offer resistance to a British Army foraging party, and was killed in a skirmish near Shrewsbury, New Jersey. He is buried in the Tennent Church Graveyard in Manalapan Township. Dr. Scudder was the only member of the Continental Congress to die in battle during the Revolutionary War, and the last Colonel to die in battle.

History  The need for a newer 20 mm defence cannon than the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon began to grow noticeably during the 1980s. The companies DCN and GIAT were contracted to design the F2 20 mm cannon, essentially a navalised version of the M693 gun used by the French Army, and sold for export.  Description  The 20 mm F2 is a mounted monotube gun, with two 150-cartridge boxes on each side of the piece. An electrical control system allows for a choice of three modes of fire: single shot, eight-shot burst, or free fire. There is an electrical trigger in the right hand of the gunner. A manual selector allows the gunner to change the box feeding the weapon during the firing, making mixed firing available. After each shot, the empty cartridge is ejected from beneath the weapon. The gun is manoeuvred by the body of the gunner, who is attached to the weapon. Firing is guided through the same optical visor as used with the Bofors 40 mm gun and the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

Susanna\\" is a minstrel song by Stephen Foster (1826‚Äì1864), first published in 1848. It is among the most popular American songs ever written. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Background In 1846, Stephen Foster moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and became a bookkeeper with his brother's steamship company. While in Cincinnati, Foster wrote \\"Oh! Susanna\\", possibly for his men's social club.Richard Jackson. 1974. Stephen Foster song book: original sheet music of 40 songs. Courier Dover Press. p. 177. The song was first performed by a local quintet at a concert in Andrews' Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1847. It was first published by W. C. Peters & Co. in Cincinnati in 1848. Blackface minstrel troupes performed the work, and, as was common at the time, many registered the song for copyright under their own names. As a result, it was copyrighted and published at least twenty-one times from February 25, 1848, through February 14, 1851. Foster earned just $100 ($ in 2016 dollars) for the song, but its popularity led the publishing firm Firth, Pond & Company to offer him a royalty rate of two cents per copy of sheet music sold, convincing him to become the first fully professional songwriter in the United States. The name Susanna may refer to Foster's deceased sister Charlotte, whose middle name was Susannah.Michael Saffle. 2000. Perspectives on American music, 1900‚Äì1950 Taylor & Francis. p. 382. Song The song blends together a variety of musical traditions. The opening line refers to \\"a banjo on my knee\\", but the song takes its beat from the polka, which had just reached the U.S. from Europe. Writer and musician Glenn Weiser suggests that the song incorporates elements of two previous compositions, both published in 1846: \\"Mary Blane\\", by Billy Whitlock, and \\"Rose of Alabama\\", by Silas S. Steele. He points out that the melody of the verse of \\"Oh! Susanna\\" resembles that of \\"Mary Blane\\", and the opening of the chorus of \\"Oh! Susanna\\" is almost identical to that of \\"Rose of Alabama\\". Moreover, the story lines of both \\"Oh! Susanna\\" and \\"The Rose of Alabama\\" involve a lover going from one Deep Southern state to another with his banjo in search of his sweetheart, which suggests that Foster got the inspiration for his lyrics from Steele's song. The first two phrases of the melody are based on the major pentatonic scale.Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.37. Seventh Edition. . The lyrics are largely nonsense, as characterized by lines such as \\"It rain'd all night the day I left, The weather it was dry, The sun so hot I froze to death...\\" (first verse) and \\"I shut my eyes to hold my breath...\\" (second verse). It is one of the few songs by Foster that use the word \\"nigger\\" (others are \\"Old Uncle Ned\\" and \\"Oh! Lemuel\\", both also among Foster's early works), which appears in the second verse (\\"De lectric fluid magnified, And killed five hundred nigger.\\"). Popularity and adaptations The song is not only one of Stephen Foster's best-known songs, but also one of the best-known American songs. No American song had sold more than 5,000 copies before; \\"Oh! Susanna\\" sold over 100,000.Stephen Foster , Meet the Musicians; accessed 2012.09.11. After its publication, it quickly became known as an \\"unofficial theme of the Forty- Niners\\", with new lyrics about traveling to California with a \\"washpan on my knee\\". A traditional Pennsylvania Dutch version uses Foster's melody but replaces the lyrics entirely. =As found in the Library of Congress:\\"Susanna\\".

Browne in 1916 (Columbia COL A-2218). Browne also released other openly racist songs that same year, including Nigger Love a Watermelon Ha! Ha! Ha!. The song is sung by a band in Wilson (1944) during the 1912 Democratic National Convention. A 1955 novelty recording of the song by The Singing Dogs reached #22 on the US Billboard Pop Singles chart. A humorous recording of \\"Oh! Susanna\\" was the last track on the second album by The Byrds, Turn! Turn! Turn!, in 1965. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). James Taylor also included a version of the song on his second album, Sweet Baby James, in 1970. In 1963, The Big 3 recorded Tim Rose's composition \\"The Banjo Song\\", which sets Foster's lyrics to a completely new melody. Rose's melody was then used for Shocking Blue's 1969 hit Venus (Shocking Blue song)https://historyofmusic.biz/all-songs/page/48/. Neil Young and Crazy Horse covered Rose's version on their 2012 album Americana. It was performed by the North Korean Chongbong Band in 2016. References External links * \\"Oh!

Though this comfort food is influenced by Italian-American cuisine as well as older New England quick and practical meals like the \\"potato bargain\\" and \\"necessity mess,\\" it is known as \\"American chop suey\\" both because it is a sometimes-haphazard hodgepodge of meat, vegetables and Italian seasonings, and because it once used rice, a base ingredient in Chinese cuisine, instead of pasta. Standard American chop suey consists of elbow macaroni and bits of cooked ground beef with saut√©ed onions in a thick tomato-based sauce. The dish can be served on a plate or in a bowl, usually accompanied by bread and often Worcestershire sauce.

A peroxy acid (often spelled as one word, peroxyacid, and sometimes called peracid) is an acid which contains an acidic ‚ÄìOOH group. The two main classes are those derived from conventional mineral acids, especially sulfuric acid, and the peroxy derivatives of organic carboxylic acids. They are generally strong oxidizers. Inorganic peroxy acids Peroxymonosulfuric acid (Caro's acid) is probably the most important inorganic peracid, at least in terms of its production scale. It is used for the bleaching of pulp and for the detoxification of cyanide in the mining industry. It is produced by treating sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide. Peroxymonophosphoric acid (H3PO5) is prepared similarly. Organic peracids Several organic peroxyacids are commercially useful. They can be prepared in several ways. Most commonly, peracids are generated by treating the corresponding carboxylic acid with hydrogen peroxide: :RCO2H + H2O2 RCO3H + H2O A related reaction involves treatment of the carboxylic anhydride: :(RCO)2O + H2O2 ‚Üí RCO3H + RCO2H This method is popular for converting cyclic anhydrides to the corresponding monoperoxyacids, for example monoperoxyphthalic acid. The third method involves treatment of acid chlorides: :RC(O)Cl + H2O2 ‚Üí RCO3H + HCl meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) is prepared in this way. A related method starts with the peroxyanhydride. Aromatic aldehydes can be autoxidized to give peroxycarboxylic acids: :Ar-CHO + O2 ‚Üí Ar-COOOH (Ar = aryl group) The products, however, react with the initial aldehyde forming the carboxylic acid: :Ar-COOOH + Ar-CHO ‚Üí 2 Ar-COOH =Properties and uses= In terms of acidity, peroxycarboxylic acids are about 1000 times weaker than the parent carboxylic acid, due to the absence of resonance stabilization of the anion. For similar reasons, their pKa values tend also to be relatively insensitive to substituents. The most common use of organic peroxy acids is for the conversion of alkenes to epoxides, the Prilezhaev reaction. Another common reaction is conversion of cyclic ketones to the ring-expanded esters using peracids in a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. They are also used for the oxidation of amines and thioethers to amine oxides and sulfoxides. The laboratory applications of the valued reagent mCPBA illustrate these reactions. Reaction of peroxycarboxylic acids with acid chlorides affords diacyl peroxides: :RC(O)Cl + RC(O)O2H ‚Üí (RC(O))2O2 \\\\+ HCl The oxidizing tendency of peroxides is related to the electronegativity of the substituents.

It is also known as recycling and conversion. Adaptive reuse is an effective strategy for optimizing the operational and commercial performance of built assets. Adaptive reuse of buildings can be an attractive alternative to new construction in terms of sustainability and a circular economy. It has prevented thousands of buildings' demolition and has allowed them to become critical components of urban regeneration. Not every old building can qualify for adaptive reuse. Architects, developers, builders and entrepreneurs who wish to become involved in rejuvenating and reconstructing a building must first make sure that the finished product will serve the need of the market, that it will be completely useful for its new purpose, and that it will be competitively priced. Definition Adaptive Reuse is defined as the aesthetic process that adapts buildings for new uses while retaining their historic features. Using an adaptive reuse model can prolong a building's life, from cradle-to-grave, by retaining all or most of the building system, including the structure, the shell and even the interior materials. This type of revitalization is not restricted to buildings of historic significance and can be a strategy adopted in case of obsolete buildings. Some urban planners see adaptive reuse as an effective way of reducing urban sprawl and environmental impact.Joachim, M. 2002, Adaptive reuse, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 Oct. 2011 Revitalizing the existing built fabric by finding a new use or purpose for obsolete buildings can be a wonderful resource to a community by \\"keeping neighborhoods occupied and vital\\". According to Yung and Chan, \\"adaptive reuse is a new kind of maintainable rebirth of city, as it covers the building‚Äôs lifetime and evades destruction waste, encourages recycles of the embodied dynamism and also delivers substantial social and economic profits to the world\\".  Advantages of adaptive reuse  According to Zaitzevsky and Bunnell, old buildings physically link us to our past and become a part of our cultural heritage; they should be preserved because of their \\"architectural beauty\\" and the \\"character and scale they add to the built environment\\". Retention and rehabilitation of existing buildings also reduces the consumption of building materials, resources, energy and water needed for new construction. *Cost savings on building material: Adaptive reuse involves the refurbishment of existing building members, which is labor-intensive process and relies less on purchasing and installing many new building materials. Cost of building materials has risen sharply over the past few decades, while the cost of labor has increased only marginally compared to that of building materials. Therefore, it is economically viable to renovate and reuse an existing building. *Cost savings on demolition: Demolition costs can run as high as 5% to 10% of the total cost of new construction. This expense is often overlooked by many building owners. Some urban areas have strict building safety regulations and may not allow the usage of a swinging ball and other more efficient demolition techniques. Under these circumstances, buildings must be demolished piece by piece, which can be quite expensive and time-consuming. *Saves time; faster than brand new construction: The total time required to renovate an existing building is generally less than the time required to construct a comparable amount of floor space in an entirely new building. A major advantage of renovating an existing building is that a refurbished portion of the building becomes suitable for occupancy before completion of the whole project. This provides as a huge advantage for private developers as it keeps the cash inflow during while the rest of the project undergoes construction. *Tax advantages: Tax provisions in several states and municipalities across the United States, provide incentives for rehabilitating historic structures. *Availability of Federal, State and local funds: The United States' National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 established matching grants-in-aid, obtained through state historic preservation offices, that can be used for the acquisition and restoration of properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Similarly, community development block grants provided to municipalities by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development are a major source of funds for neighborhood preservation projects. *Decreased public and social costs: As these heritage settlements have been getting crowded in the past decades, people have been looking for farther lands for development. This rapid urbanization and urban sprawl cause several harms to our planet and the society. Lack of adaptive reuse of existing built assets, on a societal level, has caused disturbance due to dislocation of residents, economic decline and disruption of community life, eventually leading to abandoned and obsolete neighborhoods. *Conserves energy: Old buildings represent an investment of energy and labor made at a time when costs were significantly lower. Demolition of these buildings requires new expenditures of energy to generate new building materials and to assemble them on a cleared site. Additionally, modern building systems have high life-cycle costs and operational energy costs associated with them whereas traditional masonry and stone buildings are more climate responsive. An environmental benefit of reusing built assets is identified to be the retention of the original buildings \\"embodied energy\\". According to Schultmann and Sunke, \\"new buildings have much higher embodied energy than those that are adaptively reused\\". Reddy and Jagadish support this statement by saying that \\"the reuse of building materials can provide substantial savings in embodied energy that would otherwise be wasted\\". Factors affecting adaptive reuse Building owners, architects, developers and other stakeholders undergo an in-depth process of decision making before determining whether a building should be conserved and remodeled for a different use or just demolished for the land it sits on, then develop a new building on that land. These decisions are governed by the following criteria: =Economic considerations= The Kelso Home for Girls in Baltimore, Maryland was a typical candidate for adaptive reuse, but it was razed to accommodate parking for a new athletic facility when the cost of conversion was found to be too greatThe decision to reuse or demolish built assets is driven by economic considerations such as development costs, project costs, investment returns and market. The economic costs differ from project to project and some professionals go as far as to assert that \\"new build is always more economical\\" and \\"renovation is universally more expensive\\"[1] due to their own involvement with adaptive reuse projects. Others claim that the return on investment is enhanced when using an older building because of the savings involved. One Canadian developer claims that reusing buildings generally represents a saving of between 10-12%[2] over building new. In terms of profitability, there are also assertions that adaptive reuse projects often have an uncertainty to their profitably that newer developments lack. When looking for funding to build, these considerations must be addressed.  Capital investment  In a survey conducted by Bullen and Love, it was observed that building owners and operators were most concerned about a multitude of financial considerations, while deciding whether to reuse their built assets. These include development and construction costs, marketing and maintenance costs. Most adaptive reuse projects depend on their economic feasibility determined by the building's existing physical configuration and condition. According to Bullen and Love, the adaptive reuse decision making was fundamentally driven by a \\"desire for short-term profits\\". However, most of the survey respondents were rarely concerned about the sustainability and environmental concerns associated with adaptive reuse decision making. Nevertheless, many of these developers were aware of the positive impact that building reuse and sustainability can have on their corporate image. Building owners are concerned with the life expectancy of built assets, their energy and environmental performance and the high operating costs which may appear due to poor mechanical equipment, services, building materials and construction. Developers saw a thorough potential in saving groundwork and excavation costs by using an adaptive reuse model for their property. Additionally, they thought that \\"in Central Business District locations, built assets are an attractive investment option for reuse projects, as premium prices and rents can be obtained for an office space\\". Best rents can be obtained only when these remodeled buildings hold \\"high- quality finishes\\" and have high Energy Star rating appliances. Building owners also considered the commercial performance of buildings in terms of \\"tenant needs, investment returns, maintenance, repair costs, operational costs, productivity levels, employee retention rates, aesthetics of building and its market value\\". Building stakeholders often marketed their reused built assets centered around \\"epoch and utility\\" and \\"character and ambiance\\". Some end users were more attracted to modern architecture while others were more into the adaptive reuse style. This varying perception of a building's form, function and style depended on the occupant age group.  Asset condition  Sometimes, built assets cannot be considered suitable for adaptive reuse, simply because of the nature of their built form or the condition that they are in. For example, one cannot make the most out of a highly compartmentalized, single use building such as a prison. Mid 1900s low-rise apartments that have low floor area ratios (FAR) and which may be in some of the cities' prime locations cannot be considered profitable for adaptive reuse. In such scenarios, it would be more profitable for the developers to demolish and replace the existing building with a high-rise that has more space to sell. Often, when building owners cannot find an obvious use for a building, it is left to degenerate and decay and eventually collapse. This may pose as a threat to the safety of the neighborhood. Decaying buildings may even be subject to vandalism and become spaces for anti-social activities and may have a negative impact on the value of the properties in their vicinity. Bullen and Love's survey respondents thought that \\"the benefits of reusing their existing facility could include avoiding the disruption of relocation, reducing maintenance and running costs\\". A reuse project should not compromise on satisfying user needs. The survey respondents suggested that a cost vs benefits analysis is essential to determine the return on investment of an adaptive reuse project. The most important governing factors of adaptive reuse decision making with respect to asset condition were observed to be the building's structural integrity, its residual service life, its spatial layout, its location and the ease of retrofitting or installing new building components to the existing built form. According to Bullen and Love, the buildings of the 1960s and 1970s in Perth were badly constructed, used ineffective thermal insulation materials and details and have low suitability for adaptive reuse. On the other hand, the built form of the 1980s was deemed to be engineered to specifications and could accommodate an adaptive reuse model. The survey respondents expressed several concerns and risks that could arise during and after the adaptive reuse of a building which included finding tenants, the threat of building not meeting the demand of the end users, lack of structural stability and structure and material decay during the reconstruction phase of the project.  Regulations  In Bullen and Love's survey, many respondents thought that there was not enough support and incentives from the government for carrying out adaptive reuse of built assets. They felt that there is limited flexibility in the building codes, limited plot ratio bonuses and an overall \\"lack of encouragement\\" by state and local governments to implement innovative adaptive reuse designs. Suggested solutions from some survey respondents include establishing a mandate to only lease buildings that have undergone adaptive reuse with a high Energy Star rating. Some of the architects thought that there was a high dependency and credit given to energy and green building rating systems such as the \\"Green Star Environment Rating System\\" but not enough credit was given to the improvements carried out during adaptive reuse and its sustainable outcomes such as the recycling of building materials, reduced energy and water consumption and reduced environmental impacts like global warming potential, lake eutrophication potential and ozone layer depletion. One architect thought that \\"undertaking exemplar adaptive reuse demonstration projects for industry professionals to assess and emulate would display a commitment to sustainability and urban regeneration\\". However, this solution has several harmful implications and forcing an adaptive reuse directive on to the industry and its clients was deemed to be heavy handed and could be counterproductive. The existing building codes and regulations for fire safety and building access to disabled make it difficult to work around the adaptive reuse of old constructed buildings. = Social considerations = In this civilized world, buildings have become the core of a society. Cities and communities grow organically around important buildings followed by the commercial development of those neighborhoods. These buildings and the development around them soon become the heart of a community upon which people's life depends. Therefore, regular maintenance and reuse of existing structures can help communities avoid the trauma caused by dilapidation, abandonment and clearance. As these heritage settlements have been getting crowded in the past decades, people have been looking for farther lands for development. This rapid urbanization and urban sprawl cause several harms to our planet and the society. Lack of adaptive reuse of existing built assets, on a societal level, has caused disturbance due to dislocation of residents, economic decline and disruption of community life, eventually leading to abandoned and obsolete neighborhoods. Old buildings are often found in fully developed neighborhoods where public amenities like sewers, water lines, roads, etc. have already been established. Adaptive reuse means that the stakeholders of the built asset are relieving governments and municipalities off the load of having to supply these public amenities on distant plots. In a survey conducted by researcher Sheila Conejos, several architects, developers and building stakeholders were asked about their opinion on the social implications of adaptive reuse of existing buildings. It was observed that most respondents thought that adaptive reuse is important to the society because old buildings are critical to the image and history of a society. They agreed that historical buildings add to the aesthetics of a townscape and should be preserved and reused. = Environmental considerations = Buildings consume high amounts of energy during their life-cycle. New construction requires new building materials and other resources which possess high embodied energy (throughout their extraction, manufacture, transportation, packaging and assembly phases). Additionally, they also cause high environmental damage such as global warming, eutrophication, ocean acidification, ozone layer depletion, carbon emission which in turn harms human health and quality of life. From this standpoint, there are several environmental benefits associated with building recycling or adaptive reuse.  Water efficiency  Water is an important component in building construction. Water is needed at every stage of a building's life, from building material extraction to manufacture, on-site construction processes such as concrete mixing, cleaning, etc., operational phase in the form of plumbing for human use and landscaping and fire safety, and at the end of its life for recycling building materials or disposing them. Selecting adaptive reuse over brand new construction can help relieve the planet off such water loads.  Energy conservation  Just as water is needed in every stage of a building's life, so is energy. This energy is conventionally obtained from non-renewable sources and causes high carbon emission. Minimizing fossil fuel depletion and carbon emission can be huge contributing factors to reducing global warming and mitigating climate change. Choosing to demolish an existing built asset and then constructing a brand-new building in its place can lead to high energy requirement for the demolition, building material waste management, new material procurement, construction and operation. On the other hand, sustainably retrofitting an existing built asset only requires a fraction of this energy. It is important to keep in mind that many of the old building may not have the best of operational energy use efficiency. Therefore, to achieve a successful adaptive reuse project, the designers must keep the building's energy use intensity at utmost importance.  Materials and resources  Building materials are generally procured from the Earth's strata or are end products of processed natural components. These resources are limited. Irresponsible extraction of natural compounds for building material manufacture can deplete these natural compounds from the earth. Moreover, extraction can cause harm to the natural habitat and biodiversity of the region where materials are extracted. Therefore, a project that uses minimum new building material and uses more of recycled materials is a more sustainable and responsible choice for a building material.  Built heritage preservation  A majority of historical buildings provide physical links and the progression of cultural evidence to the past.Aigwi, I. E., Egbelakin, T., & Ingham, J. (2018). Efficacy of adaptive reuse for the redevelopment of underutilised historical buildings: Towards the regeneration of New Zealand‚Äôs provincial town centres. International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, 36(4), 385-407 In a fast-growing urbanizing world, these heritage values viewed as public goods could aid the significance of a town's cultural heritage and unique competitiveness. Heritage preservation charters mandate that when historical buildings with heritage values are being redeveloped, their architectural and heritage character should be maintained and conserved for sustainability. Accordingly, this mandate on heritage preservation has led to the scheduling of several heritage buildings into district plans, thereby protecting them from unsympathetic alterations or demolition through regulations. Built heritage conservation through adaptive reuse could therefore be used to promote sustainable historical and cultural development of urban areasAigwi, I. E., Egbelakin, T., & Ingham, J. (2018). Efficacy of adaptive reuse for the redevelopment of underutilised historical buildings: Towards the regeneration of New Zealand‚Äôs provincial town centres. International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation, 36(4), 385-407.Aigwi, I. E., Egbelakin, T., Ingham, J., Phipps, R., Rotimi, J., & Filippova, O. (2019). A performance-based framework to prioritise underutilised historical buildings for adaptive reuse interventions in New Zealand. Sustainable Cities and Society, 48, 101547. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101547  Urban regeneration  The reuse of older vacant buildings for other purposes forms a very important aspect of any urban regeneration scheme.Yakubu, I. E., Egbelakin, T., Dizhur, D., Ingham, J., Sungho Park, K., & Phipps, R. (2017). Why are older inner-city buildings vacant? Implications for town centre regeneration. Journal of Urban Regeneration & Renewal, 11(1), 44-59. The adaptation process implies selecting relevant novel technologies and design concepts that will support the older buildings to adjust successfully to contemporary requirements without destroying the existing urban form. Adopting the adaptive reuse approach for the redevelopment of older vacant buildings provides added benefits to the regeneration of an urban area in a sustainable way, through transforming these buildings into usable and accessible units.Yakubu, I. E., Egbelakin, T., Dizhur, D., Ingham, J., Sungho Park, K., & Phipps, R. (2017). Why are older inner-city buildings vacant? Implications for town centre regeneration. Journal of Urban Regeneration & Renewal, 11(1), 44-59 The adaptive reuse strategy would also enable the local authority and owners of older vacant buildings in urban areas to minimize their economic, social and environmental costs, in a quest for a continued urban expansion and development.  Adaptive reuse potential  According to Chusid's \\"urban ore\\" concept, existing buildings that are fast approaching dilapidation or disuse are a \\"mine of raw materials for new projects\\". Shen and Langston built upon this idea and said that \\"an even more effective solution than raw material recovery is adaptive reuse\\". They studied that \\"a huge focus on economic factors alone has led to the destruction of buildings well short of their physical lives\\". Shen and Langston developed an integrated model for the assessment of adaptive reuse potential by comparing case studies of one urban and one non-urban setting. The basis of this model lies in that \\"opportunity rises and falls within the confines of a negative exponential decay function linked to a building‚Äôs physical life expectancy\\". According to their study, a building reaches its maximum potential for adaptive reuse at a point when the building's age and its useful life merge or meet. At this point, the building's adaptive reuse potential is either an upward curve or a downward curve which can determine whether the potential is high, medium or low. The adaptive reuse potential calculator establishes a \\"predicted useful life\\" of a building by considering a series of physical, economic, functional, technological, social, legal and political characteristics. These characteristics are used to derive an \\"annual obsolescence rate\\" and \\"environmental obsolescence\\". These outcomes are necessary to determine an optimum point at which adaptive reuse intervention should occur. Obsolescence is advanced as a suitable concept to objectively reduce the expected physical life of a building to its expected useful life. A discounting philosophy is adopted, whereby the annual obsolescence rate across all criteria is the \\"discount rate\\" that performs this transformation. An algorithm based on a standard decay (negative exponential) curve produces an index of reuse potential (known as the ARP score) and is expressed as a percentage. This decay curve in buildings can be used to establish an ARP score, which is expressed in percentage. Cities can rank their existing buildings as per their adaptive reuse potential and this data can be used by government authorities at any point in time. An adaptive reuse score of 50% or above is considered high. A low ARP score is anything below 20%. Anything between that range is considered moderate. Shen and Langston devised this concept of ARP as \\"rising from zero to its maximum score at the point of its useful life, and then falling back to zero as it approaches physical life\\". When the \\"current building age\\" is identified to be close to or end of its useful life, is the right time for builders to commence redesign.  Methodology of adaptive reuse  Buildings have a high impact on the environment, the economy and our society. Adaptive reuse has several benefits to mitigate those high impacts. Adaptive reuse projects are, in many ways, different from conventional new construction projects and must be planned and managed differently. = Building condition assessment = Before starting an adaptive reuse project and even considering refurbishment, it is important that the condition of the existing building is thoroughly assessed. A condition assessment primarily inspects a building's structural integrity, roofing, masonry, plaster, wood-work, tiling and the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. The in-depth inspection of buildings can be expensive. Nevertheless, building condition assessment is critical to the success of an adaptive reuse project and must not be avoided at any cost because this expense is insignificant relative to the injury or loss of life that a building failure might cause. One logical reason, as explained by the American Society of Civil Engineers, is that even a very well constructed building could undergo serious deterioration and eventually failure, if proper maintenance is not performed in the operational phase of the building. For example, in the year 1984, the New York City Passenger Ship Terminal went through a thorough inspection and was identified with extreme corrosion in its exterior steel columns (100% of web loss and 40% of flange loss). This condition posed a threat to the public safety and had to undergo immediate restriction of live load in spite of additional bracing of critical bents. Such inspections conclude with the preparation of a detailed report summarizing the findings of the investigation. The direct inspection of the structural system is required to a certain degree which is decided by the judgement of an experienced civil engineer. = Survey of neighborhoods = After identifying the stability and soundness of a building, it is important to survey the neighborhood to find the potential use and function of the adaptive reuse project for that segment of the market or region that the building owners wish to attract. In many cases, an adaptive reuse project might help stabilize a neighborhood which may be otherwise decaying or be at a threat of vandalism. This upward trend may create lucrative rent opportunities for building owners and dwellers of the neighborhood. This survey can be in the form of a physical inspection of the neighborhood and/or a detailed study of the zoning map of that region. Pedestrian activity, presence of sidewalks, street lights, benches and public parks and the presence of well-occupied shops and buildings can tell us a lot about neighborhoods. After the neighborhood has been established to be stable and safe and free of any infringing decay, the next step is to determine what amenities it has to offer in terms of roadways, public transportation, shopping and eating, hospitals, schools and libraries and so on. = Financial considerations = As discussed previously, adaptive reuse projects have the potential to work in phases or parts. A major advantage of renovating an existing building is that a refurbished portion of the building becomes suitable for occupancy before completion of the whole project. This provides as a huge advantage for private developers as it keeps the cash inflow during while the rest of the project undergoes construction. Keeping in mind the conclusions from structural and architectural survey, neighborhood survey and marketing survey, a budget is prepared. Building owners or developers can approach any of the financing sources such as insurance companies, foundations and funds, savings banks, building loan societies, endowment funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts, etc. = Architect‚Äôs contract = In most adaptive reuse projects, it is the architect who is the leader with the imagination of how an abandoned warehouse can become an office building or an abandoned hospital a condominium. Since the architect has a deep involvement in the success of a project, he must perform his work under a clearly defined contract. Under this contract, the architect and the owner are under the obligation of the contract and must abide by it. Progress of design, site visits and evaluation are some of the basic actions that the architect performs under this contract. There are different types of contracts, ranging from a fixed fee contract, percentage of construction cost contract and fee plus expenses contract. All stakeholders may collectively decide on the most suitable type of contract for the project. = Detailed study of structure = Before the architect and engineer begin the final designing for the building, they make a thorough structural, mechanical and architectural survey of the existing building.  Foundation and basement  The architect and engineer may look for signs of cracking of masonry wall or the settling of basement floors or upper floors which direct them to a problem in the foundation. These signs can also be detected from window sills and cornices. Appropriate survey instruments such as plumb bobs and spirit levels are recommended for use instead of a naked eye inspection. If the problem seems too severe, a test boring may reveal the cause of the problem. Additionally, the building code should be examined for fireproofing requirements.  Structural system  Analyzing the structural strength requires expertise and is one of the most crucial in terms of occupant safety. On-site inspection along with a study of existing floor plans can help engineers determine the structural stability. In some case, when the building drawings may not be available, engineers may have to scrape of the plaster to reveal the underlying structure. Wooden members of the structural system should be especially checked for rot or termite infestation. Iron or steel must be checked for corrosion and loose bearings or bolting. Additional future dead and live loads must be kept in mind while designing with the structural strength of the existing building.  Floor system  The floor system in old buildings is usually strong enough to satisfy present codes. If not, additional supporting members may be necessary. The floor and ceiling height should be able to accommodate additional stairways, vertical plumbing, electrical and HVAC. In some cases, an elevator may have to be installed.  Exterior walls  The building envelope should be examined thoroughly for cracks, watertightness (infiltration or leaks) and mortar joints. It is important to examine these exterior walls for future fenestration and air conditioning ducts.  Mechanical and electrical equipment  Buildings undergoing adaptive reuse often lack modern and energy efficient MEP systems and appliances. Heating: Determining the capacity of the heating plant for the new building use and occupancy. Existing heating systems involving boilers and burners and metal piping could be salvaged for recycling. Ventilation: Office and commercial buildings require ventilation. Toilets and kitchens also need ventilation. The floor height must be able to accommodate fan equipment. If the existing building consists some duct work, it should be tested for obstructions, deterioration and air leakage. Air conditioning: Air conditioning ducting and equipment can be expensive and demand a lot of ceiling space. These economical implications must be considered for the new use of the building before deciding the installation of an air conditioning system. Plumbing: Old buildings used galvanized iron pipes for plumbing which may be subject to serious deterioration over the years. Proper connection to municipal sewers must be evaluated and fixed if broken. Electrical: While the electrical wiring may still be intact, the panel boards, junction boxes and electrical feeders may not be as per the present day fire codes. Additionally, the switch boards may be outdated and have to be replaced. The architect and engineers must also determine of additional transformer vaults and feeder lines are necessary.  Roof and waterproofing  Older building roofing systems generally comprise the roof, parapets and cornices. Projecting metal cornices are subject to corrosion. Parapets may be subject to cracks and degrading mortar joints. A careful examination of the top-floor ceiling may reveal water leakage.  Stairways and exits  The stairway requirement for a building should be derived from present-day building codes for fire and safety. Strategic placement of new staircases and layout for maximum access should be done in order to maximize space utility and minimize the burden on the structural system. = Designing to save energy = Redesigning the existing building for new use must accommodate energy conservation strategies. Some of the most important methods of energy conservation are, reducing heating and cooling loads through building envelopes, maximizing natural ventilation potential, using daylighting and energy efficient lighting fixtures and so on.  Building envelope  A building's envelope protects it from the external weather conditions. To prevent the extreme climate of the exterior from causing discomfort to occupants, buildings use mechanical heating and cooling systems. If the building envelope is not designed well, the heating and cooling loads on the mechanical equipment might go high. Therefore, for maximum energy efficiency, building envelops should be the first layer to block out external weather conditions, then the load on the equipment can be minimized. The U value of walls should not be more than 0.06 when winter design temperatures are less than . This can be achieved by using a combination of exterior wall materials to form a high resistance wall assembly.  Windows and doors  The fenestration in an external wall assembly are the biggest wasters of energy. They waste heat by conduction, radiation and infiltration. This can be controlled to an extent by using multiple layered glazing systems and using low-e coatings on the glass. Additionally, it is important to seal the window and door systems to avoid infiltration. Similarly, in hot and sunny climates, it is important to shade windows to avoid heat gain due to solar radiation.  Roof  An exposed roof is the greatest source of heat loss during cold months and heat gains during hot months. Therefore, roof insulation becomes very crucial in extreme climate conditions. Another passive technique is to separate living spaces from roof by adding dead buffer spaces such as attics under the roof.  Floor  The only floor that need be considered is the bottom floor. It may be a slab on grade or built over a crawl space. In these cases, insulation should be considered. If the perimeter of a slab on grade is insulated from the weather, this is all that can be hoped for. Over a cold crawl space, a two-in blanket under the floor will cut the heat loss by at least 50%. A concrete floor slab can be insulated by sprayed-on insulating material.  Disassembly sequence planning  Building owners and developers can take the potential advantage of adaptive reuse by taking away components from unused buildings and then repair, reuse or recycle its constituent parts. Disassembly is a form of recovering target products and plays a key role to maximize the efficiency of an adaptive reuse project. This disassembly planning sequence aims to reduce the environmental impacts caused due to demolition using a \\"rule-base recursive analysis system\\" with practical and viable solutions. By location =Americas= Canada As a comparatively young country, adaptive reuse is not the norm in Canada, where redevelopment has typically meant demolition and building anew. Calgary and Edmonton are particularly known for their pro-demolition culture, but they are not unique in this regard.Will Ferguson ‚Äì Sandstone City . Willferguson.ca (7 October 2002). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.Photo Collections  Edmonton Public Library . Epl.ca. Retrieved on 2013-12-06. However, since the 1990s, adaptive use has gained traction. The conversion of former railway-centred warehouse districts to residential and commercial uses has occurred in Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina, and Winnipeg. Toronto's Distillery District was a former whiskey distillery In Toronto, the Distillery District, a neighbourhood in the city's southeast side, was entirely adapted from the old Gooderham & Worts distillery. Other prominent re-uses include the Candy Factory on Queen Street West and the Toy Factory, in the city's Liberty Village district, both designed by Quadrangle Architects, a firm specializing in adaptive re-use in Toronto and elsewhere. Vancouver's Yaletown, an upscale neighbourhood established in the 1990s, features warehouses and other small-industrial structures and spaces converted into apartments and offices for the gentrification of the area. Vancouver's Granville Island also demonstrates a successful mix of adaptive reuse as well as retention of traditional uses in the same district. Montreal's Griffintown, Old Port, and Lachine Canal areas all feature ex-industrial areas that have been reused or will do so in the future on current plans. Other noted adaptive reuse projects in the 2010s have included the Laurentian School of Architecture in Sudbury, which is incorporating several historic buildings in the city's downtown core into its new campus, similar to the downtown campus of NSCAD University in Halifax, and Mill Square in Sault Ste. Marie, an ongoing project to convert the derelict St. Mary's Paper mill into a mixed-use cultural and tourism hub.\\"Designers hired for Sault redevelopment project\\". Northern Ontario Business, 15 May 2014. A number of former military bases in Canada, declared surplus in the 1990s, have also proven to be opportune for adaptive reuse. An example is the former CFB Cornwallis in rural Nova Scotia which was largely converted, without demolitions, into a business park. United States Pratt Street Power Plant in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, converted into retail, restaurants, and offices. The Western Metal Building as seen during a game. Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco was the first major adaptive reuse project in the United States, opening in 1964. Urban waterfronts, historically used as points for industrial production and transport, are now selling-points for home buyers and renters. In American city neighborhoods that have seen racial and ethnic demographic changes over the last century, some houses of worship have been converted for other religions, and some others have been converted into residences. The greatest value of the adaptive use movement is characterized by the hundreds of abandoned schools, factories, hotels, warehouses and military posts that have been adapted for use as affordable housing, office buildings, as well as commercial, civic, educational and recreational centers. A large number of brick mill buildings in the Northeast United States have undergone mill conversion projects. In the United States, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, loft housing is one prominent result of adaptive reuse projects. Formerly-industrial areas such as the Meatpacking District in New York City, Callowhill in Philadelphia and SoMa in San Francisco are being transformed into residential neighborhoods through this process. This transformation is sometimes associated with gentrification. Station Square in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania is an example of a mile-long former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad terminal and headquarters being converted into a retail, office, hotel, and tourist destination. The Pratt Street Power Plant in Baltimore was converted to offices, retail, and restaurants. An example of adaptive reuse conversion to office space are The Hilliard Mills. The adaptive reuse of Empire Stores will transform seven abandoned coffee warehouse in Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City into office, retail, restaurant and a rooftop public park. Other museums adapted from old factories include \\"MassMOCA\\", the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, the Watermill Center in Long Island, New York, and The Dia Art Foundation Museum in upstate New York. In San Diego, California, the historic brick structure of the Western Metal Supply Co. building at 7th Avenue (between K and L Streets) was preserved and incorporated into the design of Petco Park, the new baseball-only ballpark of the San Diego Padres, and can be prominently seen in the left-field corner of that ballpark. It now houses the team's flagship gift shop, luxury rental suites, a restaurant and rooftop bleachers, and its southeast corner serves as the ballpark's left field foul pole. Chapman University in the city of Orange, California has created student housing by converting the Villa Park Orchards Association Packing House,Chapman‚Äôs New Student Housing Will Celebrate The Orange‚Äôs Packing History which was built in 1918 for the Santiago Orange Growers Association. The student housing complex opened in August 2018.Chapman Grand apartment complex welcomes first residents The project was built with the collaboration of KTGY Architecture + Planning, Togawa Smith Martin, and AC Martin.Student housing development on Chapman University campus includes adaptive reuse of 1918 packing house Shell station in Columbus, Ohio in 2020. The building, which formerly housed a service station, was converted into a convenience store. Throughout the United States, one of the most common examples of adaptive reuse involve gas stations. Until the 1970s, the vast majority of gas stations were service stations that offered mechanical work such as routine maintenance (oil changes, replacing tires and brakes, etc...) and more serious mechanical work such as with an engine or transmission. However, as a result of the 1970s energy crisis, gas stations were seeing a decline of traffic due to fuel shortages, as well as the service stations themselves due to cars being made to last longer. Meanwhile, the growing proliferation of convenience stores brought more profits inside the stores, and many gas stations in the 1980s and 1990s replaced their service stations with convenience stores while still selling fuel, often reusing the building that formerly housed the service bays. Some other gas stations continued to offer services but discontinued offering fuel, since they rarely made money off of fuel. Many simply went out of business, and their buildings would be reused by a variety of businesses such as restaurants, doctor's offices, banks, and specialty stores. =Australia= Richmond, Melbourne, Australia is a conversion of a former grain silo by Nonda Katsalidis. In Australia, there have been a number of adaptive reuse projects as the main cities have turned from industrial areas into areas of high value and business areas. In Sydney, sites such as the old Sydney Mint have been renovated and adapted into inner-city headquarters for the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. The movement of the city from an industrial, working class area into a gentrified area with high house prices has helped a number of adaptive reuse sites to exist within such an area, the old Hyde Park Barracks building has also been transformed from an old jail into a museum which documents and records the history of Australia's first settlers and convicts. The industrial history of Australia has also been an influencing factor in determining the types of buildings and areas which have gone on to become adaptive reuse sites, especially in the realms of private residences and community based buildings. Some such sites include, Nonda Katsalidis‚Äô Malthouse apartments in Richmond, a conversion of a former grain silo and the South Australian site of the Balhannah Mines which was adapted into a private residence and has received awards from the Housing Industry Association and the Design Institute of Australia.Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, \\"Adaptive reuse ‚Äì Preserving our past\\", DEH, Canberra In Adelaide four prominent, heritage listed 19th Century buildings in poor repair were restored, refurbished and given new roles by the South Australian Government during the Rann Government (2002 to 2011).

Gary Hitchens, \\"Rann vision shows the way in economic renewal\\" =Europe= The Bankside Power Station in London was converted for use as the Tate Gallery. Shown is the former turbine hall, used to house exhibits. One of the entrances to Manufaktura in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland In Europe, the main forms of adaptive reuse have been around former palaces and unused residences of the different European royal families into publicly accessible galleries and museums. Many of the spaces have been restored with period finishes and display different collections of art, and design. In Paris, France, the most famous example of adaptive reuse is the Mus√©e du Louvre, a former palace built in the late 12th century under Philip II and opened to the public as a museum in 1793. Also, in London, England, the Queen's House, a former royal residence built around 1614, has become part of the National Maritime Museum and houses the museum's fine art collection. The Tate Modern, also in London is another example of adaptive reuse in the European continent, unlike other adaptive reuse galleries in Europe, the Tate Modern takes full advantage of the site of the former Bankside Power Station, which involved the refurbishment of the old, abandoned power station. The wide industrial space has proven to be a worthy backdrop to modern art, with the famous turbine hall hosting artists including Olafur Eliasson, Rachel Whiteread and Ai Weiwei. Other famous adaptive reuse sites in Europe include the Maastricht branch of the Selexyz chain in the Netherlands. This project received 2007 Lensvelt de Architect interior design award for its innovative reuse and is number one on The Guardian's worldwide top ten bookstores list.Dodson, S. 2008, Top shelves, The Guardian, London, UK viewed 1 October 2011< https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops> In ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, the Izrael Pozna≈Ñski mills have been turned into the Manufaktura mixed-use development, including a mall, 3 museums, multi-cinema and restaurants.

Konarski was born in ≈ªarczyce Du≈ºe, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship. He studied from 1725 to 1727 at the Collegium Nazarenum in Rome, where he became a teacher of rhetoric. After that he travelled through France, Germany and Austria and Poland to broaden his education. In 1730 he returned to Poland and began work on a new edition of Polish law, the Volumina legum. From 1736 he taught at the Collegium Resoviense in Rzesz√≥w. In 1740 he founded the Collegium Nobilium, an elite Warsaw school for sons of the gentry (szlachta). He founded the first public- reference library on the European mainland in 1747 in Warsaw. Thereafter he reformed Piarist education in Poland, in accordance with his educational program, the Ordinationes Visitationis Apostolicae... (1755). His reforms became a landmark in the 18th-century struggle to modernize the Polish education system.

Typically in dark and somber moods, the music of Dargaard presents medieval and folk- like melodies, often orchestrated through the use of various instrument patches from a keyboard. The band is still active and has four releases at this time.  Band history Dargaard was founded by Alexander \\"Tharen\\" Opitz in 1997. Tharen had already played a prominent role in several underground bands by this time, including Abigor and Amestigon, both black metal bands and Dominion III, an industrial music act. Tharen was the keyboard player in Abigor, but Amestigon, Dominion III and Dargaard are entirely his projects. Dargaard was born out of Tharen's desire to move away from black metal and express himself through more ambient and classical music. Also joining the band was Elisabeth Toriser as vocalist. Elisabeth was the vocalist in Dominion III and was also involved in the band Antichrisis; she supplied backing vocals for Abigor's 1995 album Nachthymnen (From the Twilight Kingdom). She claimed in an interview to have split with this band because it interrupted her studies, and she felt their musical conception was different. Tharen has also commented that Elisabeth is working on another project based around acoustic guitars, but as of writing this no recordings or releases have been made. Dargaard, taken from the fantasy book series Dragonlance, is the name of a cursed stronghold that stands in everlasting darkness after a tragic failure of its owner. The name of the stronghold is in full Dargaard Keep and it belongs to the death knight Lord Soth - \\"Knight of the Black Rose\\". Music With Tharen composing the music and Elisabeth writing the vocal melodies, the band recorded their debut album Eternity Rites in October 1998 at Hoernix Studios. It was released through Napalm Records, who Tharen was already involved with due to his previous bands. This is the reason the band released no demo as the record deal was already signed with Tharen. The release was highly acclaimed by fans of metal and dark wave alike. As one reviewer put it - \\"Dargaard's 'Eternity Rites' is a climactic fairytale full of medieval/folk themes beautifully composed and perfectly performed. Majestic, frequently aggressively dark, but more often melancholic atmosphere makes for a thought- provoking listening experience.\\"Review taken from On the Surface. Retrieved on July 20, 2007. The band would return to the studio in August to create their second album. In Nomine Aeternitatis was the band's next record. Continuing the Dargaard formula, the band created another work of dark melody, the release was considered by fans to be a true milestone of innovate dark wave music. Released on June 3, 2000 through Napalm Records, it again received great praise. The band continued on their musical journey, releasing The Dissolution of Eternity in June 2001, and their latest work Rise and Fall in March 2004. Tharen himself describes the music as \\"songs [that] radiate a kind of beauty, but on the other side we always tried to make our music dark and mighty, the same goes to the lyrics. It's about my very own realm, and this realm consists of dark forces, magic and mysticism and even darkness itself that has its own kind of beauty.\\" Tharen names his influences as many, mainly from feelings gathered from reading. Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth is a named influence along with the Mysterious Realms series of books. Tharen also said that his music wasn't directly influenced by any other dark wave bands.Interview taken from Mindview. Retrieved on July 20, 2007 The lyrics, a mixture of ancient cultures, myths and mysticism and an important part in Dargaard style, are generally inspired from Tharen's \\"dreams and \\"visions\\" of other realms and dimensions\\". Dargaard remains active in the musical scene, though there has been no news about future releases yet. Tharen has said personally that the band will never tour or play live, due to his own personal commitments. The band has a solid fanbase that often join Tharen for chats on their official forum.

It was founded in 1929. It primarily produces combine harvesters. The company income in 2005 was 400 million dollars. It used to sponsor a football club that used to be called FC Rostselmash and is, as of 2008, called FC Rostov. The company name is a syllabic abbreviation of Rostovskiy zavod sel'skokhozyaystvennykh mashin (), the Rostov factory for agricultural machines. History Rostselmash was founded in 1929 as a government contractor, producing a variety of products for state farms. In 1931, the first Stalinets harvesters were produced. The Stalinets-1 was awarded with the highest award (Grand Prix diploma) during the World Industrial Exhibition in Paris in 1937 and by 1940 fifty thousand units were assembled. During Operation Barbarosa, Rostselmash dismantled its plant in Rostov-on-Don, and relocated in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. Production shifted from agricultural goods to military equipment until the end of the war. In 1943, production was returned to Rostov. After the war, the Stalinets-6 harvesters were assembled and in 1955 Rostselmash began to specialize in grain harvester production. In 1958, the SK-3 self-propelled harvesters were introduced followed by the SK-4 in 1962. By 1969, Rostselmash produced 1 000 000 harvesters. The SK Niva harvesters, introduced in 1973, remain in production for the Eastern European market. By 1984 Rostselmash produced 2 000 000 harvesters. The Don Series combines were introduced in 1986; those along with tractors were sold in North America by Belarus Tractor of Canada. Both had a reputation for poor quality, lack of operator comfort, poor reliability, and lack of part availability. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Rostselmash was incorporated into a joint-stock company in 1992, and fully privatized in 2000.

Led by The Undertaker, the Ministry was a controversial group with pseudo-Satanic-themed storylines that included rituals and sacrifices.  History  = Formation = After Paul Bearer turned his back on his son Kane and rejoined the side of Kane's brother The Undertaker at the Judgment Day: In Your House pay-per-view event in October 1998, The Undertaker announced The Ministry of Darkness and a \\"plague of evil\\" that would be unleashed on the WWF the next night on Raw Is War, making Undertaker a heel. Since then, The Undertaker continued to feud with Kane and Stone Cold Steve Austin, which involved segments in which Undertaker hit Austin in the head with a shovel giving him a storyline concussion, thus costing Austin the WWF Championship against The Rock. The following week on Raw Is War, interviews were conducted with Austin throughout the night in his hospital room in a medical center in the San Jose, California area, where the night before at a WWF live event Austin blacked out, as part of the storyline in the lead up to their Buried Alive match. Later, The Undertaker and Paul Bearer abducted Austin, at first attempting to bury Austin alive, then attempting to embalm him alive. However, before Undertaker could begin the embalming process, Kane came in through the embalming room door and attacked Undertaker, preventing the embalming from happening. On that week's Sunday Night Heat, Undertaker said that Austin would be sacrificed, but on Raw Is War instead Undertaker called out Kane, they fought and he called out Bearer, who had brought the orderlies out to the ring and Kane escaped. Backstage, Undertaker knocked Kane out with a chair shot and told Bearer to go get the orderlies and Undertaker tried to wrap Kane in a body bag as punishment, but failed when Austin hit Undertaker in the head with a shovel, knocking him out in the process as his measure of payback for hitting him in the head earlier and costing him the WWF Championship. It was assumed that Undertaker attempted to have his brother committed to the mental asylum because Kane saved Austin from the embalming process in the funeral home earlier on Raw Is War. However, Austin put the fake Kane mask on Undertaker, fooling everybody to think that Kane was going to the mental asylum, but unbeknownst to Bearer and the orderlies, Undertaker, the actual fool the entire time, was going to the asylum instead of Kane and later dumped Bearer into the sewer. Also, Undertaker tied Austin down on his symbol and crucified Austin as payback for sending him to the asylum and escaping from the embalming room weeks earlier. Undertaker's vile schemes were delayed when Kane cost him the Buried Alive match to Austin at Rock Bottom: In Your House on December 13 and he was not seen until the following month. Meanwhile, Bradshaw and Faarooq formed The Acolytes, a dark and brooding tag team briefly managed by The Jackyl. Shortly after their debut, the Jackyl would mention on color commentary that his acolytes would usher in \\"an age of tribulation\\" in the WWF and that the Jackyl would be the \\"puppet master\\" controlling everything from the shadows, effectively setting the stage for The Ministry of Darkness with the Jackyl acting as the power behind the throne. However, The Jackyl left WWF at the end of 1998, just before Bradshaw and Faarooq came under the service of a then- unknown new leader. As one of their first orders of business, they abducted Dennis Knight on the December 28 episode of Raw Is War and took him to a renewed, druid-like master \\"He\\" which they were referring to. Weeks later, this \\"He\\" turned out to be The Undertaker, who proceeded to initiate Knight as his servant via a ritual, renaming him as Mideon. At the Royal Rumble event in January 1999, The Undertaker, Mideon and The Acolytes abducted the 485-pound Mabel, who was renamed Viscera the following night on Raw Is War and turned him to the Undertaker's side. Another faction, The Brood (Christian, Edge and Gangrel), was recruited to The Undertaker's service as well and then Undertaker made it clear that he wanted to own the WWF and oust Vince McMahon. = First strike = During this time, Mr. McMahon started claiming that Mark Calaway (Undertaker's real name) was taking his gimmick too far and that Calaway actually believed that he was in fact The Undertaker and that he was the second coming of the Lord of Darkness. McMahon, shook up, put Undertaker in the second-ever Inferno match, a rematch in which Undertaker faced off against Kane (who had joined Vince's Corporation to avoid being committed to the asylum). Undertaker defeated Kane again, this time by placing his leg on fire and reduced the WWF owner to tears at the sight of a burning teddy bear. The bear was later said to have once belonged to Stephanie McMahon as a child. For weeks, Undertaker revealed that his Ministry actually took orders from a \\"greater power\\" and kept talking about a higher power who apparently owned the key to McMahon's heart and soul. Undertaker and the Ministry trespassed on McMahon's property, leaving a burning crucifix resembling The Undertaker's symbol in McMahon's front yard and McMahon ordered his enforcer, Big Bossman, to face The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania XV on March 28, which Undertaker won. After the match, The Brood lowered themselves from the rafters onto the top of the cell and then lowered a noose to Undertaker, who sent McMahon another message by hanging the Bossman from the cell. After WrestleMania XV, the mysterious woman in the storyline was revealed to be McMahon's own daughter Stephanie. The Ministry took Stephanie captive that night and Corporation member Ken Shamrock found her crying in the boiler room and with The Undertaker's symbol on her forehead. As vengeance on Shamrock for ruining his plans, Undertaker ordered The Ministry to abduct Ken's storyline sister Ryan and sacrifice her on one of his symbols as a demonstration on Undertaker's part of what would happen to Stephanie and McMahon was enraged, screaming at the camera and telling Undertaker to stay away from Stephanie. The next week on Raw Is War, Shamrock found his sister crying in the basement along with Mankind, but was ambushed, attacked along with Mankind as well, captured and attempted to be sacrificed by The Ministry of Darkness. Since Ken forced some of it out of Christian, Undertaker flogged him as punishment for giving the information to Shamrock that Stephanie was in the boiler room and the next week he tried to sacrifice Shamrock and then ordered Christian's fellow Brood members Edge and Gangrel to sacrifice him as well for his incompetence, but instead they refused and turned on The Undertaker and left the stable. This defection of The Brood was the only voluntary defection from the group during its tenure. = The Corporate Ministry = At Backlash on April 25, Mr. McMahon had Shamrock face The Undertaker in the hopes that Shamrock would break Undertaker's ankle with his ankle lock toehold submission, but his plan backfired and Shamrock was attacked by Bradshaw after the match. Later, The Undertaker commandeered Stephanie McMahon's limo and shouting to her \\"Where to, Stephanie?\\" while laughing and drove off into the night with a screaming Stephanie in tow as Backlash went off the air. The next night on Raw Is War, Undertaker held a \\"Black Wedding\\" for himself and Stephanie because if he married the WWF owner's daughter, he would control the entire WWF. His wish was about to come to fruition, until the ceremony was ruined successfully by Stone Cold Steve Austin, after two attempts by Corporation members Big Show and Ken Shamrock failed. As a result, on the very first ever episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker proceeded to join forces with Vince McMahon's son Shane, in turn gaining control of The Corporation and merging his Ministry with it to form the even more powerful Corporate Ministry. However, after Mr. McMahon was revealed as its \\"Greater Power\\" on the June 7 episode of Raw, The Corporate Ministry would eventually dissolve. The Undertaker formed a new \\"Unholy Alliance\\" with Big Show, Mideon and Viscera, which led to two WWF Tag Team Championship reigns for Big Show and Undertaker. This group came to an end when The Undertaker suffered a legit injury in September and was written out by quitting, rather than taking a match ordered by Mr. McMahon. = Aftermath and legacy = In 2004, during the final three SmackDown! shows prior to The Undertaker and Bradshaw (now under the gimmick of JBL, the initialism of John Bradshaw Layfield) facing off at No Mercy for the WWE Championship in a Last Ride match, a series of Ministry- reminiscent events occurred between Undertaker and his former servant: * On the September 16, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, JBL called out The Undertaker. When Undertaker came out and had JBL cornered, Gangrel and Viscera appeared and took out Undertaker from behind, commencing an assault by the foursome of Gangrel, JBL, Orlando Jordan and Viscera (however, Orlando Jordan was not a former member of the Ministry). * The September 23 episode of SmackDown! saw Gangrel and Viscera, introduced as the Ministry, face Undertaker in a handicap match, which was won by Undertaker. * On the September 30 episode of SmackDown!, JBL faced Hardcore Holly. Undertaker had a vignette with the hearse telling JBL to prepare to take his last ride and rest in peace at No Mercy. In an interview after that and prior to the match, JBL had asked where was Orlando Jordan, who was not with him. Following a preemptive assault by Holly, JBL came out for the match. During the match, he assaulted Holly with a weapon, getting disqualified, after which yet another Undertaker vignette interrupted him. Undertaker revealed Orlando hung high in the stands, crucified on his symbol. JBL would beat The Undertaker at No Mercy with interference from Jon Heidenreich to retain the WWE Championship. During this series, the SmackDown! announcers mentioned Gangrel and Viscera's former Ministry status, but never during the entire Undertaker/JBL feud was it brought up that Bradshaw used to be a part of the Ministry. Instead, the excuse given for Gangrel and Viscera's insert was that \\"JBL paid them off\\". However, at The Great American Bash in July 2006, as JBL was calling the match between Big Show and Undertaker, JBL mentioned that he had fought The Undertaker for the WWE Championship and had been on his side in The Ministry of Darkness.

It is best known for its fruit, called custard apple, a common name shared with fruits of several other species in the same genus: A. cherimola and A. squamosa. Its common names include wild sweetsop, soursop and bullock's heart. The fruit is sweet and useful in preparation of desserts, but is generally less popular for eating than that of A. cherimola. Description Custard apple for sale at a fruit vendor near Sangareddi, Telangana, India It is a small deciduous or semi- evergreen tree reaching to tall with an open, irregular crown. The slender leaves are hairless, straight and pointed at the apex (in some varieties wrinkled), to long and to wide. The yellow-green flowers are generally in clusters of three or four to diameter, with three long outer petals and three very small inner ones. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.Walker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1‚Äì130. The fruits vary in shape, heart-shaped, spherical, oblong or irregular. The size ranges from to , depending on the cultivar. When ripe, the fruit is brown or yellowish, with red highlights and a varying degree of reticulation, depending again on the variety. The flesh varies from juicy and very aromatic to hard with a repulsive taste. The flavor is sweet and pleasant, akin to the taste of 'traditional' custard. Distribution and habitat Possibly a native of the Caribbean and Central America, Annona reticulata is now pantropical and can be found growing between altitudes of to in areas of Central America that have alternating wet and dry seasons. It is cultivated in many tropical countries, and also occurs as feral populations in many parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Australia, and Africa. It is cultivated and naturalized in many parts of the world including Southeast Asia, Taiwan, India, Australia, and Africa.  Climate  Although the tree grows optimally in tropic conditions, it is also found in subtropical regions. It requires humid conditions (medium to high rainfall). Compared to the other Annonas, it is less drought tolerant. The annual temperature necessary ranges from 17 to 27 ¬∞C. It tolerates light night frosts to -2 ¬∞C. A. reticulata grows on many soil types with pH ranging from 5 to 8. It does not tolerate waterlogging or when the water table is too high.  Cultivation  Seeds can be propagated. Other techniques for cultivation are grafting and budding. The tree produces 45 kg of fruits per year. In Asia, the season lasts from July to September, and in the Caribbean, it runs from February to April.  Uses  =Food= Custard apple can be eaten raw, out of hand as a fresh fruit. It is not as popular as the sugar apple or the cherimoya. It can also be prepared as juices, ice-cream or puddings. In India, it is cooked into a sauce. =Propagation= A. reticulata may be grown in home gardens, even though it may not be as popular as the sugar apple (A. squamosa). It has value as rootstock for superior Annona species, such as the sugar apple, especially under humid conditions. It is also a genetic resource for hybridization. =Other= The leaves and the branches can be used for tanning as they contain blue pigments. Wrappers, ornaments and hats can be made from the inner bark. The wood is soft and can be used to make utensiles, even though, it is weak and of bad quality.  Nutrition  In a 100 gram reference amount, custard apple supplies 101 calories, 23% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C and 17% DV of vitamin B6, with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table). Raw custard apple is 72% water, 25% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table).  Risk and impact  Annona reticulata is known to be an invasive plant.A PIER risk assessment gave a score of 11 for the Annona Reticulata. It negatively impacts the population cultivating the crop as all parts of the tree (except the fruit) are toxic, possibly causing problems for human health.  Diseases and pests  The diseases that can spread to Annona reticulata include the Anthracnose, the leaf spot, the diplodia rot and the black canker. The spiral nematode, the stunt nematode and the mealybug can also infect the plant Aroma and phytochemicals The fragrant aroma of A. reticulata results from some 180 compounds, including the volatile compounds, alpha-pinene, myrcene, and limonene, among others. The plant is rich in tannins.  Traditional medicine  Various traditional medicine uses have been reported over centuries for its dried fruits, bark, or leaves.

It is also used as a drum to accompany Cantonese opera. This drum is an idiophone, where the whole body of the instrument vibrates to produce sound. It is a small piece of wood carved into the shape of a fish, with a slit along the length of the body. This drum is then struck by a mallet to produce sound. A much larger version, with much more ornate decoration, symbolizing a mythical fish, whose sounds is supposed to attract divinity, is used in Taoist and Confucian ceremonies. This version of the drum, also struck by a mallet, is hit at regular intervals during Confucian and Taoist ceremonies to mark the intervals of prayer. It is connected with the use of rain prayers and prayers connected to death rites.

Largely active in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the group were widely known as the cities top pickpockets and sneak thieves during the \\"Gay Nineties\\" period. An early member of this gang would later become known as a prominent New York gangster Jack Zelig. Crazy Butch Simon Erenstoft, also known as Crazy Butch, was supposedly orphaned at age 8, abandoned by his parents in Manhattan, where he began pickpocketing. According to legend, he later found a dog, which he later named Rabbi, and trained it to snatch purses and bring them around the corner at Willett Street and Stanton Street where he would be waiting. Crazy Butch Gang In the early 1890s the gang began a \\"snatch racket\\", where a gang member would purposely drive his bicycle into a pedestrian and begin an argument. As a group had gathered to watch the argument the other gang members would pickpocket the crowd. Then they would meet back at their headquarters on Forsyth Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side to divide up the money. The gang was allied to the Eastman Gang who were at almost constant war with the Five Points and Humpty Jackson Gangs between the late 1890s and early 1900s as they were incorporated into the Squab Wheelmen, an ally of Monk Eastman's organization. The gang broke up when Crazy Butch was killed by Harry the Soldier in a gunfight over a female shoplifter known as the Darby Kid. References Further reading *Ferrara, Eric.

The name of the group is very similar to sinsemilla, referring to cannabis which is unfertilised and hence seedless (literally \\"without seed\\" in Spanish). The band first used this name in concert at the F√™te de la Musique in 1991, referring to the reggae album Sinsemilia by Black Uhuru. This was the first of more than a thousand concerts, and in the following fifteen years more than one million albums have been sold. Since the success of their first album and their single \\"Tout le bonheur du monde\\", Sinsemilia has helped French reggae gain the attention of the media. In 2005, because of the success of \\"Tout le bonheur du monde\\", they were invited by the editors of France 2 to appear on the 1:00 pm news. They began their performance by singing \\"Tout le bonheur du monde\\" but quickly interrupted it to then sing their politically charged song \\"Bienvenue en Chiraquie\\", which provoked a small media scandal.

A student of Benjamin Latrobe and mentor to Thomas Ustick Walter, Strickland helped establish the Greek Revival movement in the United States. A pioneering engineer, he wrote a seminal book on railroad construction, helped build several early American railroads, and designed the first ocean breakwater in the Western Hemisphere. Life and career Strickland was born in the Navesink section of Middletown Township, New Jersey and moved with his family to Philadelphia as a child.Strickland, William (1788 - 1854), Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Accessed July 26, 2018. \\"Born in Navesink, NJ, to John and Elizabeth Strickland, William Strickland had the advantage of a master carpenter father who moved the family to Philadelphia in c. 1790 and became a charter member of the Practical House Carpenters' Society in 1811.\\" In his youth, he was a landscape painter, illustrator for periodicals, theatrical scene painter, engraver, and pioneer aquatintist. His Greek Revival designs drew much inspiration from the plates of The Antiquities of Athens. Second Bank of the United States, Philadelphia (1819-24) Strickland and Latrobe competed to design the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia (1819‚Äì1824), a competition that called for \\"chaste\\" Greek style. Strickland, who was still copying classical prototypes at this point, won with an ambitious design modeled on the iconic Parthenon of Athens. Proud of the building, Strickland had it included in the background of his 1829 portrait by Philadelphia society painter John Neagle. The oldest building designed by W. Strickland, which is preserved to this day, is the Holy Trinity Romanian Orthodox Church, located at 222-230 Brown Street Philadelphia (Northern Liberties Area), formerly known as St. John's Episcopalian Church. An anonymous report from its consecration, published on September 21, 1816, in Relf‚Äôs Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, describes the church as a ‚Äúneat and elegant edifice‚Äù whose ‚Äúdesign was given by Mr. William Strickland, of this city,‚Äù and whose ‚Äúexecution has done justice to the taste of the Architect.‚Äù (Jeffrey. A. Cohen, 1983). Strickland's evolving talent and confidence is seen in the later Merchants' Exchange (1832‚Äì34). Also in Philadelphia, the Merchant Exchange is built on classical example ‚Äî for example, the cupola is based on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates ‚Äî but is a unique building styled to fit the site. It was to be located on a triangular plot at the intersection of two major thoroughfares between the waterfront and the business district. The elegant, curved east fa√ßade faces the waterfront, and reflects the carriage and foot traffic that would have been circulating in front of the building. This elevation is unique ‚Äî Greek Revival, but modern ‚Äî while a more staid and formal elevation can be found on the west side, facing Third Street. In the same year he designed the Merchants' Exchange, 1832, Strickland entered a project in the competition for Philadelphia's Girard College, which won the second prize.Bruce Laverty, Michael J. Lewis, and Michelle Taillon Taylor, Monument to Philanthropy: The Design and Building of Girard College, 1832-1848 (Philadelphia: Girard College, 1998), pp. 39-41; 46-47; 56-57 Merchants' Exchange, Philadelphia (1832-34) Strickland's 1836 National Mechanic Bank at 22 South 3rd Street, set on a narrow plot between two taller neighbors, has strong, square pilasters to support the portico and ornate stone carving at their tops to defend the building against its taller and bulkier neighbors. One of Strickland's last Philadelphia designs and among his smallest, the building is now occupied by National Mechanics Bar and Restaurant. Strickland also executed works in other styles, including very early American work in the Gothic Revival style, including his Masonic Hall (1808‚Äì11, burned 1819) and his Saint Stephen's Church (1823), both in Philadelphia. He also made use of Egyptian, Saracenic and Italianate styles. He later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where his Egyptian-influenced design of the First Presbyterian Church (now the Downtown Presbyterian Church) was controversial but today is widely recognized as a masterpiece and an important evocation of the Egyptian Revival style. Strickland was also a civil engineer and one of the first to advocate the use of steam locomotives on railways. Some argue that Strickland's observations made during visits to England in the 1820s were highly influential in the transfer of railway technology to the United States: \\"William Strickland's Reports are the starting point of American railway engineering, and represent the state of knowledge as the first railways were planned in that country.\\"Strickland's ReportWilliam Levitt (Early Railways 3, 2006) In 1835, the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad hired him to survey a route from Wilmington, Delaware, to Charlestown, Maryland. Later that year, he was named chief engineer of the Delaware and Maryland Railroad. Strickland designed and built the Delaware Breakwater, the first breakwater in the Americas and the third in the world. Several architects and engineers of note began or developed their careers in Strickland's employ, including Thomas Ustick Walter, Gideon Shryock and John Trautwine.https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/25248 Strickland died in Nashville and is buried within the walls of his final, and arguably greatest work, the Tennessee State Capitol.

The screenplay concerns a police sergeant who kills a man while on a stakeout, then must prove that it was self-defense. The screenplay by Mann Rubin was based on the novel 711 - Officer Needs Help by Whit Masterson. Baseball stars Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale signed to appear in the film during their 1966 holdout, but never made it onto the screen when both agreed to contracts with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Filming took place between the third and fourth seasons of Janssen's television series The Fugitive. The script was written by Mann Rubin, who had authored the Fugitive episode \\"A Taste of Tomorrow\\", while the film was directed by Buzz Kulik with a jazz score by Jerry Goldsmith. It was released by Paramount Pictures. Plot Los Angeles police sergeant Tom Valens is on a stakeout near an upscale apartment complex when he is forced to defend himself from a mysterious figure who aims a gun at him on a foggy night. The trouble is, the dead man turns out to be a prominent physician and pillar of the community, Dr. James Ruston, and there is no gun to be found. Valens is in trouble with his department, specifically Roy Klodin, his captain. It doesn't help that Valens is still carrying the memory of having been shot while on duty nearly a year earlier. He is placed under suspension by the force while Frank Sanderman, a prosecutor with a grudge against trigger-happy cops, files manslaughter charges against this one. Setting out on his own to clear his name, Valens meets resistance from many including Ruston's financial adviser, Calvin York, and the doctor's alcoholic and flirtatious widow, Doris Ruston. Also unwilling to be of help to Valens is the doctor's nurse, Liz Thayer, who knew Ruston only as a humanitarian who made many trips to Mexico to unselfishly aid people in need. The controversial cop's lone defender in public is acerbic television personality Perry Knowland, who turns out to be doing so only to increase his viewership (upon learning this Valens acidly tells Knowland, \\"Be against me, I'd feel cleaner\\"). Even the elderly lady whom Dr. Ruston often came to visit, Alice Willows, speaks only with devotion to the doctor, who was very kind to her beloved dog. While trying to find some reason why Ruston would have been skulking in the fog near the apartments and brandishing a gun, Valens meets Alice Willows again after her dog passes away and she has him buried with all of his toys at a nearby pet cemetery. Among the few offering a sympathetic ear are his estranged wife, Joanie, and another apartment resident, Walt Cody, a playboy pilot. Cody volunteers to fly Valens down to Mexico to see first-hand why Dr. Ruston commuted there so often. Complications arise when Liz Thayer is found dead in Ruston's ransacked office, obliging Valens' partner, Sgt. Ed Musso, to try to place his friend under arrest. But upon learning that Ruston's office was ransacked, Valens realizes what has been happening, and also what happened to the gun he knew he saw Rustin brandishing. He overpowers Musso, locks him in his closet, then goes to the pet cemetery where, once again, Valens must decide whether to pull the trigger on someone who is pointing a gun directly at him.

In 1938, after escaping Nazi annexation of Austria he came to London via Paris and stayed for a short while at 39 Elsworthy Road before moving to 20 Maresfield Gardens, where the museum is situated. Although he died a year later in the same house, his daughter Anna Freud continued to stay there until her death in 1982. It was her wish that after her death it be converted into a museum. It was opened to the public in July 1986. Freud continued to work in London and it was here that he completed his 1939 book Moses and Monotheism. He also maintained his practice in this home and saw a number of his patients for analysis. The centrepiece of the museum is the couch brought from Berggasse 19, Vienna on which his patients were asked to say whatever came to their mind without consciously selecting information, named the free association technique by him. The museum was the subject of Part 2 of Richard Macer's 3 part BBC documentary series 'Behind the Scenes at the Museum' in 2010. There are two other Freud Museums, one in Vienna, and another in P≈ô√≠bor, the Czech Republic, in the house where Sigmund Freud was born. Location and description Statue of Sigmund Freud by Oscar Nemon, a two-minute walk from the museum at the corner of Fitzjohns Avenue and Belsize Lane The museum is located at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead, one of London's suburbs. The ground floor of the museum houses Freud's study, library, hall and the dining room. The museum shop is on ground floor as well. The first floor has a video room, Anna Freud's room and there is a temporary exhibitions room which hosts alternate contemporary art and Freud-themed exhibitions. Art installations often use several rooms within the museum, such as the 2001/02 exhibition \\"A Visit to Freud‚Äôs\\" by Austrian photographer Uli Aigner. Many areas such as the kitchen and Anna Freud's consulting room are out of public view and have been converted into offices. Building The house had only finished being built in 1920 in the Queen Anne Style. A small sun room in a modern style was added at the rear by Ernst Ludwig Freud that same year. Freud was over eighty at this time, and he died the following year, but the house remained in his family until his youngest daughter Anna Freud, who was a pioneer of child therapy, died in 1982. The house has a well maintained garden which is still much as Freud would have known it. Collection Freud's couch The Freuds moved all their furniture and household effects to London. There are Biedermeier chests, tables and cupboards, and a collection of 18th century and 19th century Austrian painted country furniture. The museum owns Freud's collection of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Oriental antiquities, and his personal library. The star exhibit in the museum is Freud's psychoanalytic couch, which had been given to him by one of his patients, Madame Benvenisti, in 1890. This was restored at a cost of ¬£5000 in 2013. The study and library were preserved by Anna Freud after her father's death. The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically. In addition to the books, the library contains various pictures hung as Freud arranged them; these include 'Oedipus and the Riddle of the Sphinx' and 'The Lesson of Dr Charcot' plus photographs of Martha Freud, Lou Andreas-Salom√©, Yvette Guilbert, Marie Bonaparte, and Ernst von Fleischl. The collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dal√≠. The museum organises research and publication programmes and it has an education service which organises seminars, conferences and educational visits to the museum. The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health & Medicine.

In 1906 the family moved to Antwerp. She enrolled on a typing course in London. Charlotte later described herself as a \\"feminist and suffragette\\" from the age of sixteen. During the First World War her parents were interned but emigrated in 1915 to the United States. She married Jack Burghes in 1918 and they had a son Ronnie. Charlotte joined the Daily Express as a journalist in 1920; she also became an advocate of divorce reform, married women's employment, and easier access to contraception. In 1924 she interviewed the biologist J.B.S. Haldane for the Daily Express, and they soon became friends. She then had a scandalous divorce from her husband, and married Haldane in 1926. In the same year, Haldane wrote a dystopian novel, Man's World, set in a world ruled by a male scientific elite who restrict the number of women born. From adolescence women in this world are either made into \\"vocational mothers\\" or, if they have no interest in motherhood, they are sterilized by the government and become \\"neuters\\". Man's World is sometimes compared to other dystopian novels of the interwar period, including Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and Katharine Burdekin's Swastika Night.\\"Other dystopias of the period like Charlotte Haldane's Man's World (1926) and Katherine Burdekin's Swastika Night (1937) investigate the ways in which gender informs totalitarian regimes\\".

It is the cathedral of the Diocese of Portsmouth and the seat of the bishop of Portsmouth. The Anglican cathedral is one of the two cathedral churches in the city, the other being the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth, about one mile to the north. History The font beneath the tower, part of the original medieval building Around the year 1180, Jean de Gisors, a wealthy Norman merchant and Lord of the Manor of Titchfield, gave land in his new town of Portsmouth to the Augustinian canons of Southwick Priory so that they could build a chapel \\"to the Glorious Honour of the Martyr Thomas of Canterbury, one time Archbishop, on (my) land which is called Sudewede, the island of Portsea\\". It was given so that they could build a chapel dedicated to the honour of St Thomas of Canterbury, who was assassinated and martyred ten years earlier. This chapel was to become, in turn, a parish church in the 14th century and then a cathedral in the 20th century. The medieval building, dedicated in 1188, was cruciform in shape, with a central tower, which was used as a lookout point and lighthouse, over the crossing. Of the original building, only the chancel and the transepts remain. The church survived a French raid in 1337 which had laid waste most of Portsmouth during the Hundred Years War. However, in 1449, Adam Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, was murdered by local sailors. The town's inhabitants were excommunicated and the church was closed. In 1591, Elizabeth I worshipped in St Thomas's Church. During the English Civil War, when the Parliamentary forces attacked the town in 1642, the Royalist garrison used the church tower to observe the movement of enemy forces. Parliamentary gunners positioned in Gosport fired on the tower and inflicted damage to the church. This resulted in the ruin of the medieval tower and nave. With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 came the authorisation by Charles II for a collection in churches across the country to raise the ¬£9,000 required to rebuild the tower and nave, which took place from 1683 to 1693. The nave was built in the classical style. Galleries were added in 1708 to cater for growing congregations, and were extended in 1750. The wooden cupola with a lantern for shipping was added to the top of the tower in 1703. A ring of eight bells was given at the same time. Two additional bells were cast in 1957 and currently the central tower contains a total of 12 bells. All of the bells were cast at Taylor's Bell Foundry and are hung in the wooden octagonal part of the tower. Various repairs and alterations were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1902, the church was closed for two years so that much-needed work on the foundations could be carried out. During this period, St Mary's Colewort, a chapel of ease, served as the temporary parish church. =Cathedral= Quire The establishment of the Diocese of Portsmouth, which had split from the Diocese of Winchester in 1927, brought about significant changes. On 1 May of that year, the parish church of St Thomas of Canterbury became the pro-cathedral of the new diocese, becoming the second cathedral in Portsmouth, as the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist had already opened in 1882. At a chapter meeting in October 1932, a first sketch plan for an extension to the church was submitted by Charles Nicholson. He was called upon to extend the church to a size that would dignify its cathedral status; by 1935 the \\"provisional\\" nature of its title had been dropped. The style that Nicholson chose is that of a round-arched \\"Neo-Byzantine\\" style that echoed the \\"classical\\" style of the late seventeenth century quire. By 1939 the outer quire aisles, the tower, the transepts and three bays of the nave had been completed. The base of the seventeenth century tower had been opened up to form the tower arch. However, with the Fall of France in June 1940 during World War II, work on the extension scheme stopped and the bays of the nave were blocked off with a \\"temporary\\" brick wall. This wall remained there for over fifty years. During the Second World War, the Cathedral suffered minor damage to the windows and the roof. Nicholson died in 1949 and attempts headed by Bernard Montgomery to finish the structure in the 1960s proved unsuccessful due to substantive failure to find sufficient funds. However, as the building had been used for many years without its extension, it was quite usable and there was no urgency to finish the work. By the mid 1980s, however, the \\"temporary\\" brick wall was found to have become unstable and in danger of collapse, which made the completion work pressing. The task of the architects was to find a solution to the problem of finishing Nicholson's truncated nave: the nave was originally intended to be longer, in the traditional style of an English cathedral, but the changing needs of the diocese meant that the building was finally built with a foreshortened nave, the final west wall being located close to where the temporary structure had been. Efforts were started to raise the ¬£3 million necessary to carry out the plans. Work began in January 1990 and eventually a fourth bay of the nave, western towers, tower rooms, rose window, gallery, ambulatory, together with the stone altar beneath Nicholson's tester and the new stone font were added. In November 1991, the completed building, much smaller than the original plans envisaged, was consecrated in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Architecture Nave looking west The formal entrance into the cathedral is through the bronze west doors, designed by Bryan Kneale. The design is based on the tree of life, an ancient symbol representing the renewal of life. The completed nave is a square space that is enclosed by an outer ambulatory. The ambulatory is low and vaulted. Because the furniture in the nave is not fixed, it can be used for various means, including concerts and exhibitions as well as services. On the rood screen, beneath the nave organ case is a sculpture called Christus by Peter Eugene Ball. The nave organ case was designed by Didier Grassin in 2001; the inside of the panels were designed by Patrick Caulfield. The left side depicts night, with a stylised lighthouse shining on the sea (which alludes to the City of Portsmouth's motto, \\"Heaven's Light Our Guide\\"). The right door depicts day, showing the sun and the hull of a fishing boat. The tower is pierced to provide an organ loft raised on a low dark passage. The font (1991), made to a Greek design of the ninth century, is placed centrally between the nave and the quire. In the south tower transept is the bronze status of St John the Baptist by David Wynne. It was cast in 1951 as a memorial to a Winchester College pupil killed on the Matterhorn. On the north wall of the south tower transept is the painting The Miraculous Draught of Fishes by William Lionel Wyllie. The north tower transept contains a ceramic plaque of the Virgin and Child by the Florentine sculptor Andrea della Robbia. The principal altar stands on a podium of Purbeck stone, with mosaic work by Richard Noviss. The lectern was the gift of Edward VII in 1903. The pulpit was installed in 1693 and is all that remains of a three-decker pulpit. The organ case, built by Francis Bird, with carved figures of cherubs and King David playing his harp, belongs to the Nicholson Organ and bears the date 1718. In 1939, an extension of the Portsmouth Cathedral used granite from a quarry as far away as Pulau Ubin, Singapore, which was then a British colony.http://www.nlb.gov.sg/biblio/202560351 Page 18 Music Music department There are three choirs at the cathedral. The cathedral choir consists of up to 20 boys and a 'back row' of adult alto, tenor and bass singers made up of six choral scholars and six layclerks. They sing Choral Evensong each Monday (low voices only), and Tuesday, Friday and Sunday (with the boys). Cantate is the girls' choir, established in 2006 to sing Choral Evensong each Thursday. The Cathedral Consort (previously known as the Parish Choir) is a mixed choir of adults and younger singers which sings Choral Evensong on Saturdays and other periods outside term time. Often, the choirs combine to form the Great Choir, usually at large services and events. The choirs regularly go on tour, with recent European visits including destinations such as Tallinn (Estonia), Stockholm (Sweden), Salzburg (Austria), Berlin (Germany), Gozo (Malta), Ypres (Belgium) and Notre Dame des Neiges in the Alpe d'Huez (France). The Organist and Master of the Choristers, currently David Price, oversees the Music Department and is assisted by the sub-organist and Michael James Organ Scholar. Sachin Gunga has been sub- organist since January 2018. The Michael James Organ Scholar is appointed annually and is usually undertaken by an undergraduate during their gap year. Cathedral organs The cathedral's three-manual and pedal, forty-nine stop organ was installed in 1994 by Nicholson & Co Ltd. The pipes were taken from the John Nicholson organ of 1861 built for Manchester Cathedral, which had been relocated to Holy Trinity Church, Bolton, in 1874; it was rebuilt by Jardine & Co in 1905. In 2001, the West Great division was added, in order for the organ to speak into the nave. The renovated organ was officially inaugurated in November 2001, by a recital given by Olivier Latry, titular organist at Notre Dame de Paris. Finally, in 2017, horizontal Trompete de Maris fanfare reed division above the main entrance was added. In 2007, the cathedral introduced a single manual, three-stop chamber organ built by Kenneth Tickell & Co of Northampton.

Invented in its original large ring form by Bill Booth, and subsequently scaled down for thinner Type 17 webbing risershttp://www.dropzone.com/safety/Gear_and_Equipment/Do_Skydivers_Care_About_Safety_19.html the three-ring system allows a skydiver to quickly cut-away a malfunctioning main parachute with a single motion. Skydivers usually need to do this quickly during emergencies in which they need to deploy a reserve parachute. The three-ring system is simple, inexpensive, reliable, and requires fewer operations than earlier parachute release systems while reducing the physical force needed. The large bottom ring is securely attached to the skydiver's harness, the middle ring is securely attached to the end of the parachute riser, and the small ring is securely attached to the parachute riser above the middle ring. The middle ring is passed through the large ring and looped upwards; the small ring is then passed through the middle ring and looped upwards. Continuing in the same manner, a cord loop is passed through the small ring, loop upwards, and finally passes through a grommet to the opposing side of the parachute riser. A semi-rigid cable attached to a release handle then passes through this loop, securing the loop. Releasing the cord loop by removing the cable with a tug causes the three-ring system to cascade free and quickly disconnect the riser from the harness. Each ring in the series multiplies the mechanical advantage of the loop of cord that is held in place by the semi-rigid cable (a Lolon-F or Teflon impregnated plastic coated steel cable, depending on manufacturer). Variations There are a few different variations of the 3-ring system. The original 3-ring release from the late 1970s is now known as large 3-rings. A version using smaller rings (mini rings) was introduced in the 1980s. The reasons for the development of the mini ring system and the associated smaller risers were mostly aesthetic; the mini rings do not increase safety but actually reduce the mechanical advantage inherent in the system thereby increasing the pull force a jumper must apply to cut-away. Tandem systems still use rings that are even larger than the original rings, and some tandem rigs even use four rings (e.g., Advance Tandem by Basik). Other variations have placed the rings under the risers facing back instead of forward of the risers facing front or varied the geometry of the rings for example using an elongated middle ring for a claimed improvement in mechanical advantage on Aerodyne's miniforce system. Safety concerns Front and side views of a 3-ring (mini rings) release system on a single riser of a packed main parachute Since the introduction of the 3-ring system, variations in the design have raised safety concerns. For example, the move to mini rings and mini risers caused riser failures on some designs until riser strength was improved. The failure of some manufacturers to include stiff riser inserts and other hard housing cable guides to allow the free movement of the cutaway cable when risers and webbing are twisted has caused difficulty in cutting away from malfunctions with riser twists or harness deformations.http://www.skydiver.com.au/userfiles/files/Hard%20Housings.pdf The tolerance in the manufacture of the fabric risers and their connection to the rings is critical in maintaining the mechanical advantage of the 3-ring system and this has been compromised in some designs. Reversed risers placing the rings under the risers has prevented the rings moving freely and releasing under some cutaway scenarios. Replacement of the Lolon-F coating with Teflon impregnated compounds has caused both crackinghttp://www.uk- skydiver.co.uk/cms/files/file/1294-cutaway-cablespdf/ and cable strippinghttp://www.dropzone.com/cgi- bin/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_attachment;postatt_id=147094;http://www.dropzone.com/cgi- bin/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_attachment;postatt_id=147095;http://www.dropzone.com/cgi- bin/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_attachment;postatt_id=147096; problems. Maintenance Regular maintenance of the 3-ring system and risers is essential.https://www.apf.com.au/ArticleDocuments/73/PSB110186.pdf.aspx?Embed=Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWFhgbM7z4k Manufacturers recommend that the risers be disconnected from the harness and flexed, the rings should be checked for cracks or corrosion and the cable should be removed from the housing, cleaned and lubricated, typically with silicone based lubricant.

He succeeded his father Pons of Toulouse upon his death in 1061. His mother was Almodis de la Marche, but she was kidnapped by and subsequently married to Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona when William was a boy. He was married to Emma of Mortain (daughter of Robert, Count of Mortain and a niece of William of Normandy), who gave him one daughter, Philippa. He married twice, and produced two legitimate sons; neither, however, survived infancy, leaving daughter Philippa as his heiress. As Toulouse had no tradition of female inheritance, this raised a question with regard to succession. In 1088, when William departed for the Holy Land, he left his brother, Raymond of Saint-Gilles, to govern in his stead (and, it was later claimed, to succeed him). Within five years, William was dead, and Raymond in a perfect position to take powerIt has been claimed that William married daughter Philippa off to the King of Aragon, Sancho Ramirez, to prevent her from causing civil war by claiming Toulouse (e.g. Meade, Marion, Eleanor of Aquitaine). However, two recent historians who have made a detailed study of the issue have dismissed this claim. Ruth E Harvey, in \\"The wives of the first troubadour Duke William IX of Aquitaine\\", Journal of Medieval History, vol 19, 1993, p 315, concludes that, contrary to prior assumptions, William IX was certainly Philippa of Toulouse's only husband. Szabolcs de Vajay, in \\"Ramire II le Moine, roi d'Aragon et Agnes de Poitou dans l'histoire et la l√©gende\\", M√©langes offerts √† Ren√© Crozet, 2 vol, Poitiers, 1966, vol 2, p 727-750, states that the marriage to an unnamed king of Aragon reported by a non-contemporary chronicler is imaginary, even though it has appeared broadly in modern histories, and he cites J de Salarrullana de Dios, Documentos correspondientes al reinado de Sancho Ramirez, Saragossa, 1907, vol I, nr 51, p 204-207 to document that his prior wife, Felicie, was clearly still married to Sancho months before his death, thus making the marriage several years earlier to Philippa completely unsupportable. ‚Äì although, after Philippa married William IX of Aquitaine, they laid claim to Toulouse and fought, off and on, for years to try to reclaim it from Raymond and his children. He was the great-grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine, by his daughter's marriage to William IX of Aquitaine, and Eleanor's descendants would continue to lay nominal claim to Toulouse based on descent from William IV.

It is about 5 miles (8 kilometres) east-north- east of Stirling and is one of a string of towns that, because of their location at the base of the Ochil Hills, are collectively referred to as the Hillfoots Villages or simply The Hillfoots.  Etymology  The name Menstrie, recorded as Mestreth and Mestryn in the 1260s, is of Pictish origin. The name is composed of elements cognate to Welsh maes, meaning \\"field, plain\\", and tref, \\"town, village, farm\\". Physical geography Menstrie stands on the carse or flood plain of the River Devon, between 10 and 20 metres altitude above sea level. It is roughly astride the Ochil Fault whose movement gave rise to the dramatic southern scarp of the Ochils but which is now almost quiescent. Two of the most westerly summits of the Ochil Hills, Dumyat and Myreton Hill, rise steeply to the north of the village to reach about 400m altitude. These two hills are divided by Menstrie Glen, from which the small watercourse of Menstrie Burn emerges and runs through the village. About a kilometre to the south of Menstrie, the burn joins the River Devon which in turn meets the River Forth at Cambus. The Menstrie Burn, though generally tranquil, drains a catchment area (Menstrie Glen) of about 14 km2 in the Ochil Hills and occasionally experiences flash floods. On 29 August 2012, the burn overflowed its banks and 38 elderly residents of Menstrie House had to be evacuated to other care homes within the region. No-one was hurt. The Community Centre and some nearby roads and houses were also flooded though no residents needed evacuation. The A91 road was closed for some hours while structural engineers checked the integrity of the bridges over the burn.http://www.menstrie.org/cp201209.html#flood Menstrie Community Policing report, September 20121 http://www.alloaadvertiser.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/09/07/435198-menstrie- house-flooding-misery/ Flooding in Menstrie, August 2012 Alloa Advertiser, 7 Sep 2012) Clackmannanshire Council commissioned a consultants' report on the flood event and has made the summary available to the public in PDF format.http://www.clacksweb.org.uk/site/documents/transport/menstrieburnfloodriskassessmentpublicsummary/ Menstrie Burn Post Flood Study, Summary Report, May 2013 Facilities The village has two general stores (one containing the Post Office), a pharmacy, a pub (The Holly Tree), caf√© (the Forge), beauty clinic (the Doll House), take away (Flames) and a petrol station. A large community centre, the Dumyat Centre is located at the centre of the village opposite the pub and includes a library, sports hall, sports changing rooms, meeting rooms, kitchen and public toilets. The Dumyat Centre services a public park with sports fields, children's play area and off street parking. The village has an active Bowling club, and Scout, Cub, Beavers and Guide, Brownies and Rainbows groups with the Scouts based at the Menstrie Scout Hall next to Menstrie Burn. It also has a primary school, a community garden on Castle Terrace, a residential establishment for older people, Menstrie House http://www.clacksweb.org.uk/social/menstriehouse/ Menstrie House, Clackmannanshire Council Social Services and two churches; one being Menstrie Parish Church (Church of Scotland) and the other being of the United Free Church of Scotland. In 2018 Clackmannanshire Council, as part of council wide cuts, announced plans to close the Dumyat Centre. A local residents group, Menstrie Community Action Group,https://menstrieorg.wordpress.com/ Menstrie Community Action Group, MCAG is now (Nov 2019) running Menstrie‚Äôs Dumyat Centre on behalf of the local community. Transport links Menstrie is on the A91 road from Stirling to St Andrews. It used to be served by Menstrie & Glenochil Railway Station on the Alva Line until that closed. Bus services run to Stirling via Stirling University, to Alloa via Alva and Tillicoultry or via Tullibody, and less frequently to St Andrews. Beginning in late 2010, bus services also run to Clackmannan and to Forth Valley Royal Hospital near Falkirk via Alloa. Industry and population A conspicuous zig-zag roadway up the scarp face of Myreton Hill, nowadays used by the local sheep farmer for access to his livestock, was originally built during the Napoleonic Wars for access to some mine workings, which produced calcite. However, the volume of material mined was rather small in proportion to the effort needed to build the road, so the venture is unlikely to have been economic. There seems to be no record of why calcite was considered to be sufficiently valuable to have justified the considerable effort. Menstrie and surrounding area in 1895 The occupants of Menstrie once processed wool from sheep farmed on the Ochils. In 1800, businessmen from Tullibody set up a carding and spinning mill on the east side of the Menstrie Burn to exploit its soft water and power, absent from their own village. In the early 19th century a straight road was built on the flat ground of the carse or floodplain to by-pass the old Hillfoots Road and improve the transport of goods to and from the Hillfoots villages. Menstrie's Long Row and Ochil Road lie on the old route along the foot of the hills. The new road, now the A91, became a focus for construction of churches, houses, mills and shops. By the mid-19th century, the Elmbank and Forthvale mills were in business on either side of the Menstrie Burn. In 1841, Menstrie's population was about 500 but had increased to more than 900 by 1881.http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/towndetails198.html The Gazetteer for Scotland, population estimates: 1841, 1881 In the 1860s a company, which included the owners of local mills and a distillery, financed a branch railway line through Menstrie to a terminus in Alva.http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Alva_Railway/frame.htm RAILSCOT: History of the Alva railway branch This joined the old North British Railway (N.B.R.) line between Alloa and Stirling at Cambus.A goods train delivered Molasses to docks at Greenock. Menstrie had its own passenger station at the North end of Tullibody Road. Practically nothing of the station remains and the railway branch line, which continued to carry freight after the Beeching Axe, fell into disuse during the mid-1980s in favour of road transport. The Glenochil Distillery had opened in the middle 18th century on the site of the Doll Farm to the east of the village, beside the Dams Burn. At its peak, around one million bottles of grain whisky were made. Manufacturing has continued on this site for more than 250 years though production of whisky stopped around 1930. Yeast, initially a by-product of whisky fermentation, had gradually become the main product and went for manufacture of whisky and bread. Soft water, locally available, is still useful. An extensive bonded warehouse area remains for storage of whisky as it matures in barrels before bottling, while bakers' yeast has given way to fermentation products derived from yeast. The whisky and yeast businesses are now operated by separate companies, namely Diageo, (successors to Distillers Company) and Kerry Group. The latter conducts product development as well as manufacturing at the Menstrie site. Elmbank Mill, Menstrie in March 2010 The Forthvale Mill no longer stands but the Elmbank Mill,http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/47139/details/menstrie+elmbank+mill/ RCAHMS: Menstrie, Elmbank Mill having been used for some years as offices by the Water Board, now houses small businesses. A furniture factory, The Charrier, stood near the Menstrie Burn but was destroyed by fire in about 1968. A street nearby now bears its name. In the mid-20th Century, Menstrie (pop. 1200 - 1300) http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/towndetails198.html The Gazetteer for Scotland, population estimates: 1951, 1961 was home to families whose menfolk worked the Clackmannanshire Coalfield and other mines in Central Scotland. http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=1344 Map of mineral resources in Clacks, Falkirk and Fife British Geological Survey 'Copyright' NERC 2008 As the mining and textile industries have declined, Menstrie has become a commuter village, spreading over the adjacent farmland. At the Censuses in 1991, 2001 and 2011, Menstrie's population was 2274, 2083 and 2804 respectively.http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk- scotland.php?cityid=103001 (Data from General Register Office for Scotland) For 2016, the population was estimated as 2872.

Commercial forestry A forestry company, UPM Tilhill,http://www.upm- tilhill.com/ UPM Tilhill website has published plans to plant commercial woodland in the Ochil Hills above Menstrie on the eastern and northern flanks of Menstrie Glen. This would affect recreational use and customary access routes, though UPM have made alterations to accommodate some concerns. Forestry operations, including movement of heavy machinery and extraction of harvested timber would take place via widened roads and strengthened bridges on Sheriffmuir rather than through Menstrie, according to the plan. The plan includes an area, on Myreton Hill, of broadleaf woodland. This would be the main effect seen from Menstrie and nearby Hillfoots villages. The conifer planting would, however, be visible from further afield; for instance Stirling Castle, National Wallace Monument and Tullibody. More information about the plans is available on Menstrie Community Council's web site.http://www.menstrie.org/of140814.html Jerah forestry: Menstrie's web site, autumn 2014 Planting had begun by early 2015.

This was Millar's fourth novel, and the final one published using his real name‚Äîhe is generally better known by his later pseudonym Ross Macdonald. Plot summary Lieutenant Bret Taylor married his wife after knowing her only over a single overnight drinking binge while on shore leave during the war. His ship is bombed out of the water and he returns home to find his wife freshly murdered in the home he bought but had never seen. The shock of the two events sends him into a mental lapse, and he's in an asylum. The woman who loves him, a successful screenwriter, calls in a specialist who jogs his memory‚Äîand his sense of duty. Taylor hits the streets of Los Angeles, digging through his wife's lies and lovers in an attempt to avenge her murder. The book is a psychological thriller, with the main action being the unraveling of the story within Taylor's mind. The reader is denied information that other major characters obviously have throughout the whole novel, and is meanwhile treated to long passages of theories from the main character. Alfred A. Knopf, Jr., who functioned as an editing publisher, asked for revisions in what he considered a slow-paced novel. Millar cut '10,000 good words' and concentrated the action into four days. The 1980 movie Deadly Companion (or Double Negative) was based on this novel.

Early life Most was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City. He lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1970. He attended Lehigh University for three years from 1970 to 1973, but did not graduate. Originally intending to study engineering, he changed his major to business after his first semester. He made plans during his junior year to spend the summer of 1973 in search of acting jobs in Hollywood before completing his studies at Lehigh. Instead, he landed the Ralph Malph role on his third audition and moved to California to pursue acting full- time.Longsdorf, Amy. \\"Happy Days star reflected on days at Lehigh University for new film Moola,\\" The Morning Call (Allentown, PA), Sunday, May 11, 2008. Most appeared on the 113th and final filmed but never aired episode of Room 222, entitled \\"Jason and Big Mo\\", in the role of Louie, the red-headed class wisecracker. David Jolliffe had handled the role of Bernie, the red-headed class wisecracker, for all prior appearances. Room 222 aired for the last time in January 1974, just as Happy Days began, and on the same network, ABC. Acting credits Most played jokester Ralph on Happy Days, appearing up until the eighth season and then in the final season in a guest role. Most has appeared in other film and television work. Film credits include Leo and Loree (1980), EDtv (1999), Planting Melvin (2005) and The Great Buck Howard (2008). He also made the regular round of guest appearances on TV shows like Emergency!, CHiPs, Baywatch, The Love Boat, Sliders, Star Trek: Voyager, Diagnosis: Murder and Glee. He also made an appearance on Charles in Charge, alongside his former Happy Days co-star, Scott Baio. He plays a man who has just won the lottery and, as part of the cameo joke, he runs up to Baio and waving the winning ticket shouts, \\"It looks like happy days are here again!\\" (He also receives several looks from Baio that suggests familiarity throughout the episode.) He is sometimes credited as \\"Donny Most.\\" Voice acting Most performed as a voice actor on several Saturday morning cartoon series. Among these roles were: Ralph Malph on The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang (1980); Eric the Cavalier in Dungeons & Dragons (1983); and Stiles on Teen Wolf (1986‚Äì1989). Most had a cameo as himself in the fifth season Family Guy episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\" in 2007. Music career United Artists released Most's only pop album, Donny Most, in the fall of 1976; it did not chart. A single from the album, \\"All Roads (Lead Back to You)\\" b/w \\"Better to Forget Her\\" (aided by Most performing it on an episode of Happy Days) spent three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1976, peaking at #97; a second single, \\"One of These Days\\", was released as a promo to record stations only. Most released two other pop singles, \\"Here's Some Love\\" b/w \\"I'm Gonna Love Loving You\\" on the Venture label in 1978 and \\"I Only Want What's Mine\\", from the soundtrack of the film Leo and Loree (which starred Most and occasional Happy Days co-star Linda Purl) on Casablanca Records in 1980; neither record charted. By 2016, Most had switched to swing music, and released a Christmas CD, Swinging Down The Chimney Tonight on Summit Records; as of 2017, he was touring the US in a show called \\"Donny Most Sings and Swings\\", performing a set of 1950s songs with a seven-piece backing band. Personal life Most married actress Morgan Hart (daughter of burlesque queen Margaret Hart Ferraro) in 1982. They have two daughters and live near Los Angeles, California. Happy Days lawsuit On April 19, 2011, Most and four of his Happy Days co-stars, Erin Moran, Marion Ross, Anson Williams and the estate of Tom Bosley, who died in 2010, filed a $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS, which owns the show, claiming they had not been paid for merchandising revenues owed under their contracts. The cast members claimed they had not received revenues from show-related items, including comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunch boxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards and DVDs where their images appear on the box covers. Under their contracts, they were supposed to be paid five percent from the net proceeds of merchandising if their sole image were used, and half that amount if they were in a group. CBS said it owed the actors $8,500 and $9,000 each, most of it from slot machine revenues, but the group said they were owed millions. The lawsuit was initiated after Ross was informed by a friend playing slots at a casino of a \\"Happy Days\\" machine on which players win the jackpot when five Marion Rosses are rolled. In October 2011, a judge rejected the group's fraud claim, which meant they could not receive millions of dollars in potential damages. On June 5, 2012, a judge denied a motion filed by CBS to have the case thrown out, which meant it would go to trial on July 17 if the matter was not settled by then. In July 2012, the actors settled their lawsuit with CBS. Each received a payment of $65,000 and a promise by CBS to continue honoring the terms of their contracts.

The character's first appearance was in Ka-Zar the Savage #11; he was created by Bruce Jones and Brent Anderson. Fictional character biography Belasco is an ancient, evil sorcerer serving the Elder Gods, and is perhaps best known for his kidnapping of Illyana Rasputin. =Early history= Belasco's early history is told by the poet Dante, though there is some dispute as to the veracity of these accounts. Allegedly, Belasco was a sorcerer in 13th Century Florence, Italy who used his knowledge of alchemy and the black arts to contact the Elder Gods (actually extra- dimensional demonic entities). He forged a pact with them enabling them to cross the barrier to our dimension using a pentagonal arrangement of five Bloodstones. In return, Belasco was granted immortality and immense mystical power. He was also given a demonic appearance, as he was intended to form a new race of Earth-dwelling demons. To this end, he kidnapped Bice \\"Beatrice\\" dei Portinari, beloved of Dante, to give birth to the first of this new race. He fled with her to the Atlantean isle of Pangea, where the Elder Gods directed him to Mt. Flavius, where their summoning ritual could take place. While en route, Belasco raped Beatrice, and she was nine months pregnant by the time they arrived. He embarked onto the island, closely pursued by Dante, and took Beatrice into a network of underground passages designed to resemble Hell. Dante found them just in time to witness Beatrice dying in childbirth and, enraged, he attacked Belasco. During the battle, a pipe was accidentally struck, releasing an unknown liquid that placed Belasco in suspended animation. At some point on the island, Belasco also lost the locket containing the Bloodstones. =Modern history= Belasco and Magik by Niko Henrichon In recent years, the volcano mountain becomes active again, releasing Belasco. He quickly locates the locket and finds a new sacrifice, Shanna O'Hara. He places her under his mental control and begins the spell. He seeks to make Shanna the mother of a demonic race he would father. However, Shanna's mate Ka-Zar appears and hurls the locket into the volcano, sealing away the Elder Gods and apparently destroying Belasco.Ka-Zar the Savage #11-13 However, he instead is trapped in Limbo, also called Otherplace, where he spends his years conquering it. Once complete, he draws the young Illyana Rasputina to him and she is transported to Limbo. His intention is to make her his disciple and use her to open a gateway for the Elder Gods. The X-Men follow to save Illyana. Due to the warping of space and time in Limbo, there are two alternate but equally valid outcomes to the rescue attempt. In one, the X-Men transport Illyana back to Earth, but are themselves trapped in Limbo, and are one-by-one killed by Belasco and his minions over the course of several decades; in the other, the X-Men escape back to Earth and Illyana is trapped in Limbo.Uncanny X-Men #160 He makes Illyana his apprentice in the dark arts, transforming her into a \\"demon sorceress.\\" He forcibly shapes part of her soul into the first Bloodstone, giving her great potential for power and allowing him to hold sway over her so that she willingly creates a second. However, after guidance from the remaining X-Men in Limbo, she rebels against him, driving him from Limbo.Magik: Storm and Illyana #1-4 Magik is later deposed as the ruler of Limbo by the demon S'ym.New Mutants #50 During Illyana's seduction, Belasco also attempts to transform Ka-Zar and Shanna into demons to be parents to a new demonic race. He is seemingly defeated when Ka- Zar impales Belasco on his own sword.Ka-Zar the Savage #29 Belasco is next revealed to be the new master of the Cat People.Fantastic Four #314 Belasco eventually takes control of Limbo once more. The cultist \\"the Rev\\" worships Belasco, mistaking him for Lucifer. Belasco seeks to wipe out humanity, using the Rev as a pawn. The Rev is defeated and killed by the Punisher.Punisher (vol. 2) #35-40 Belasco also turns Alpha Flight-ally Witchfire against her team by influencing her demonic side.Alpha Flight #122-124 She finally is restored to normal and returns to Beta Flight, Alpha Flight's support group.Alpha Flight #129-130 (Feb. - March 1994) Later, Belasco and the fear- demon D'Spayre contested to corrupt Cable, the son of Madelyne Pryor, who had been the ally of S'ym and N'astirh during \\"Inferno\\". Belasco banished D'Spayre and summoned himself, Cable, and Cable's ally Lee Forrester to Limbo, where S'ym threw Belasco out of his way and fought with Cable. Cable won, and he and Lee returned to Earth. It was eventually revealed that Illyana's best friend Kitty Pryde had received Illyana's Soulsword after Illyana had died; in dying, she had bonded the Soulsword to Kitty's own essence. After Kitty's team Excalibur fought off several claimants to the sword, Nightcrawler's girlfriend Amanda Sefton was given the sword. She then gave the sword to her mother, Margali Szardos, who was in turn kidnapped by Belasco and brought to Limbo. Nightcrawler and Sefton freed her, and Sefton secretly took the sword and adopted the codename Magik for herself. Belasco and his allies, the N'Garai demons, fought the X-Men again soon after, but were defeated by the X-Men with the assistance of the new Magik. =Quest for Magik= Cast into an even lower level of hell by his disappointed gods, Belasco used the life-force of a low level demon to regain access to the Limbo dimension. Once there he fought his way through Amanda Sefton's minions before battling the sorceress himself. As opposed to their first battle, Belasco was successful and cast her out of Limbo, becoming Limbo's ruler once again. Seeking to discover if the first Magik (Illyana Rasputin) was truly dead or simply hiding, Belasco summoned the New X-Men because he felt the scent of the House of M Magik on them. It is revealed that Belasco's fixation on Illyana is not simply for her powers, but also because he fell in love with her. Finally Belasco was defeated by Magik with the help of a reformed Pixie, who stabbed him with a 'Souldagger'. Now Magik is the new ruler of Limbo, served by S'ym and N'astirh and in search of her soul. Powers and abilities Belasco is one of the most powerful sorcerers on Earth and possesses a wide knowledge of the mystical black arts. He possesses the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including the ability to fire concussive bolts of mystical energy, create protective shields of mystical energy, transform and transmute matter both living and inanimate, travel interdimensionally, shoot mystical rays, control the minds of humans and animals, and raise the dead under certain circumstances. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of spells from a variety of books of occult spells that he can use. He was also endowed by the Elder Gods with immortality and some degree of invulnerability. His demonic form apparently also possesses augmented physical strength, as he was effortlessly able to overpower Ka-Zar with his one good arm, and pick him up by his throat using his tail. However, his own sword, which was forged by the Elder Gods themselves, has the power to harm him. It was this which cut off his right arm under unrevealed circumstances. Belasco's powers are somehow linked to those of Magik. When they fought a battle in Otherplace and Magik took on her \\"Darkchilde\\" form, Belasco simultaneously reverted to human form, losing most of his power and his invulnerability in the process. He has also come to possess a wide knowledge of the advanced technology left by the Atlanteans in Pangea. Additionally, he is an exceptional swordsman and battle tactician and was seen wielding a battle axe with great skill.

It was issued as the B-side of the single \\"From Me to You\\", which was recorded on the same day (5 March 1963). While not released on an LP in the United Kingdom until Rarities in 1978, the song was the second track on The Beatles' Second Album in the United States. As the B-side of the single \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\", it hit No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1964. Background Originally titled \\"Thank You, Little Girl\\", the song was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney as a tribute to the band's many female fans. McCartney said, \\"We knew that if we wrote a song called, 'Thank You Girl', that a lot of the girls who wrote us fan letters would take it as a genuine 'thank you'. So a lot of our songs were directly addressed to the fans.\\" Written ‚Äúeyeball to eyeball\\", a phrase Lennon and McCartney would later use to describe their early formulaic writing sessions, \\"Thank You Girl\\" demonstrates how they were able to produce a song from scratch by working in total partnership. Lyrically, Ian MacDonald suggests that Lennon probably wrote the first line of each verse, allowing McCartney to use his flair for word play and inner-rhyming in completing it. Lennon said the song was originally intended as a single: \\"'Thank You Girl' was one of our efforts at writing a single that didn't work. So it became a B-side or an album track.\\" In April 1972, he told Hit Parader, \\"[The song was written by] Paul and me. This was just a silly song we knocked off.\\" McCartney seemed to agree describing it as \\"a bit of a hack song, but all good practice.\\" Both \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"Thank You Girl\\" were credited to \\"McCartney‚ÄìLennon\\", as were eight of the songs on the Please Please Me album. It would be permanently changed to the more familiar \\"Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney\\" songwriting credit for their next single release, \\"She Loves You\\". Recording The song was recorded in thirteen takes, the same number of takes needed to perfect \\"From Me To You\\" on 5 March 1963. This recording session is also notable because it marks the first studio appearances of two Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songs that would not be released until much later in the band's career: \\"One After 909\\" (later re- recorded, appearing on Let It Be) and \\"What Goes On\\" (later re-recorded, appearing on Rubber Soul, credited as Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney/Starkey to reflect Ringo's contribution to the lyrics). Although both songs were rehearsed, only \\"One After 909\\" was recorded, and even then the results were deemed unsatisfactory for release. John Lennon overdubbed the harmonica without the other Beatles eight days later. According to multiple sources, John came to the session directly from bed due to a severe cold. Engineer Geoff Emerick said it took John numerous takes to produce a satisfactory result because he was so unsteady. The stereo mix of the song (included on the Capitol LP The Beatles' Second Album) is noticeably different from the original single mono mix (re-released on CD in 1988 on the compilation Past Masters, Volume One) in the middle 8. In the stereo version, a couple of extra harmonica lines can be heard, as well as at the very end of the song. In addition, this stereo mix contained reverb added by Capitol. The unadulterated stereo mix was released for the first time on the 2009 remastered CD Past Masters. Cover versions The song was covered by the Smithereens on their 2008 album B-Sides The Beatles.

It verifies the file system integrity of a volume and fixes logical file system errors. It is similar to the \`fsck\` command in Unix and similar to Microsoft ScanDisk which co-existed with \`CHKDSK\` in Windows 9x and MS-DOS 6.x. Implementations An early implementation of a 'CheckDisk' was the CHECKDSK that was a part of Digital Equipment Corporation hardware's diagnostics, running on early 1970s TENEX and TOPS-20. =SCP 86-DOS= The \`CHKDSK\` command was first implemented in 1980 by Tim Paterson and included in Seattle Computer Products 86-DOS. =MS-DOS / IBM PC DOS= \`CHKDSK.COM\` in IBM PC DOS 1.0 The command is available in MS- DOS versions 1 and later. \`CHKDSK\` is implemented as an external command. MS- DOS versions 2.x - 4.x use \`chkdsk.com\` as the executable file. MS-DOS versions 5.x and later use \`chkdsk.exe\` as the executable file. MS-DOS 5.0 bug \`CHKDSK\` and \`UNDELETE\` in MS-DOS 5.0 have a bug which can corrupt data: If the file allocation table of a disk uses 256 sectors, running \`CHKDSK /F\` can cause data loss and running \`UNDELETE\` can cause unpredictable results. This normally affects disks with a capacity of approximately a multiple of 128 MB. This applies to \`CHKDSK.EXE\` and \`UNDELETE.EXE\` bearing a datestamp of April 9, 1991. This bug was fixed in MS-DOS 5.0a. =Microsoft Windows= The command on Windows XP \`CHKDSK\` can be run from DOS prompt, Windows Explorer, Windows Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell or Recovery Console. On Windows NT operating systems, \`CHKDSK\` can also check the disk surface for bad sectors and mark them (in MS-DOS 6.x and Windows 9x, this is a task done by Microsoft ScanDisk). The Windows Server version of \`CHKDSK\` is RAID-aware and can fully recover data in bad sectors of a disk in a RAID-1 or RAID-5 array if other disks in the set are intact. On Windows NT family, a standard \`CHKDSK\` scan consists of three phases of testing file metadata. It looks for errors but does not fix them unless it is explicitly ordered to do so. The same applies to surface scan‚Äîthis test, which could be extremely time- consuming on large or low-performance disks, is not carried out unless explicitly requested. \`CHKDSK\` requires exclusive write access to the volume to perform repairs. Due to the requirement of the monopolized access to the drive, the \`CHKDSK\` cannot check the system disk in the normal system mode. Instead, the system sets a dirty bit to the disk volume and then reboots the computer. During the Windows start-up, a special version of \`CHKDSK\` called \`Autochk\` (a native mode application) is started by the SMSS.EXE and checks the drive if the dirty bit is set. Because of the exclusive access requirement and the time-consuming nature of \`CHKDSK\` operation, Windows Vista implemented a new file system health model in which the operating system fixes errors on the volumes as it encounters them. In the event that the problem is grave and a full scan is required, Action Center notifies the user to take the volume offline at the first convenience. Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 added self-healing ability, turned on by default, in addition to providing the \`CHKDSK\` command. It detects physical file system errors and silently fixes them on the fly. Thus, many problems previously discovered on running \`CHKDSK\` never appear. It is administered by \`fsutil repair\` command. The alleged Windows 7 bug Before the release of Windows 7, InfoWorld reported an alleged memory leak in \`CHKDSK\`; according to the report, the \`chkdsk /r\` command would cause the memory consumption to reach the maximum and the system to crash. Randall C. Kennedy of InfoWorld attributed the original report to \\"various Web sources\\" and said that in his tests, the memory consumption reached above 90%, although he did not experience a crash. Nevertheless, Kennedy took the memory consumption for a critical bug that would derail Windows 7's launch and chastised Microsoft. Tom Warren of Neowin dismissed Kennedy's assessment of the alleged leak's significance. Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft also responded that Microsoft could not reproduce a crash either but that the massive memory consumption was by design, to improve performance, and not a leak. Ed Bott of ZDNet also reviewed the claim with his own tests and observed that no crash would occur. Noting that \`chkdsk /r\`, by design, does not work on the system drive while Windows is online, Bott concluded \\"it‚Äôs arguably a feature, not a bug, and the likelihood that you‚Äôll ever crash a system this way is very, very small and completely avoidable.\\" =DR/Novell DOS= DR DOS 6.0 also includes an implementation of the command. =FreeDOS= The FreeDOS version was developed by Imre Leber and is licensed under the GNU GPL 2. =ReactOS= The command on ReactOS The ReactOS implementation is based on a free clone developed by Mark Russinovich for Sysinternals in 1998. It was adapted to ReactOS by Emanuele Aliberti in 1999 and supports volumes using the FAT32 filesystem. The command does not support volumes using the Btrfs filesystem, although ReactOS supports it since version 0.4.1.

He is best known for his work Mevo Hatalmud (Introduction to the Talmud), which serves both as commentary and introduction. Chajes is also known as \\"The Maharatz Chajes\\" (), the Hebrew acronym for \\"Our Teacher, the Rabbi, Zvi Chajes\\". He is possibly the only commentator included in the back of the Vilna Shas edition with a PhD. Biography Chajes was born in Brody. He studied under a number of great scholars of that time, particularly R. Ephraim Zalman Margulies. In addition to his traditional talmudic education, he was educated in modern and classical languages and literature, as well as geography, history and philosophy. In 1846, a law was promulgated in Austria compelling rabbinical candidates to pass a university examination in the liberal arts and philosophy; Chajes received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. At twenty two, he was called to occupy an important rabbinic position in the district of Zhovkva (Zolkiev), Galicia. In this position, he fought against the innovations being introduced into Judaism at that time, while also opposing the increasing conservatism among his Orthodox colleagues. Chajes died prematurely in 1855 at the age of 50, only three years after being appointed to the prestigious post of rabbi of Kalisz (Kalish), Poland. Chajes produced many works of scientific study of Judaism that were faithful to tradition but modern in their orientation and organization. In this role he is closely associated with Nachman Krochmal and S. L. Rapoport. \\"There are few modern works dealing in detail with the Halakha or the Haggadah which have not profited by the labors of Chajes, although his name is often passed over in silence. His Introduction to the Talmud is especially noteworthy...\\" . Dr. Bruria Hutner David describes Chajes as \\"Traditionalist and Maskil\\" - as the subject of her PhD thesis. The name Zvi Hirsch is a bilingual tautological name in Yiddish.Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. / It means literally \\"deer- deer\\" and is traceable back to the Hebrew word ◊¶◊ë◊ô tsvi \\"deer\\" and the German word Hirsch \\"deer\\".. Works Mevo Hatalmud (The Student's Guide Through the Talmud, English edition published by Feldheim, 1952) deals with both the Halakha, the legal aspects of the Talmud, and the Aggadah, the non-legal portions. In this work, Chajes imparts a detailed history and classification of the Talmud and its underlying oral tradition. This work is the first modern attempt on the part of Orthodoxy to formulate the nature, extent, and authority of tradition. Chajes also authored: *Torat Neviim: treatises on the authority of Talmudic tradition, and on the organic structure and methodology of the Talmud. *Darkhei Horaah: an examination of the rules that obtained in Talmudic times in deciding practical religious questions. *Imre Binah: treatises on the relation of Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, on lost aggadah collections, on the Targumim, on Rashi's commentary to tractate Taanit, and on Bath Kol. *Tiferet L'Moshe *Minhat Kenaot: against Reform Judaism. * Glosses to the Talmud, now published as standard in the Romm-Vilna edition of the Talmud.

History  The band was started by Tharen (real name Alexander Opitz) in 1998 shortly after his other band, Dargaard, released their debut. Dominion III (also known as Dominion¬≥ but this name is no longer used) was his expression into heavier industrial music to express his feelings. As with Dargaard, it also features the vocals of Elisabeth Toriser. Tharen dubbed the music 'apocalyptic electronic music' with their debut release The Hand and the Sword. The music was expressive and heavy, and dealt with dark and angry themes. Tharen's music often displays traits of this, coming from a black metal background. The band was signed to Napalm Records as were Tharen's other musical projects. The second release came two years after The Hand and the Sword, titled Life Has Ended Here. The music displayed a more industrial edge and was far more guitar-driven. This was because of the addition to the line-up of J√∂rg Lanz, who was in Tharen's black metal band Amestigon. The music continued to display an aggressive nature combined with sinister soundscapes. Tharen has spoken of moving Dominion III to another record label, one more centered on industrial music. In 2006, Dominion III left Naplam Records but no news has been released of a new record label at the time of writing.

In standard inflationary cosmological models, the redshift of cosmological bodies is ascribed to the expansion of the universe, with greater redshift indicating greater cosmic distance from the Earth (see Hubble's Law). This is referred to as cosmological redshift. Ruling out errors in measurement or analysis, quantized redshift of cosmological objects would either indicate that they are physically arranged in a quantized pattern around the Earth, or that there is an unknown mechanism for redshift unrelated to cosmic expansion, referred to as \\"intrinsic redshift\\" or \\"non-cosmological redshift\\". In 1973, astronomer William G. Tifft was the first to report evidence of this pattern. Subsequent discourse focused upon whether redshift surveys of quasars (QSOs) have produced evidence of quantization in excess of what is expected due to selection effect or galactic clustering. The idea has been on the fringes of astronomy since the mid-1990s and is now discounted by the vast majority of astronomers, but a few scientists who espouse nonstandard cosmological models, including those who reject the Big Bang theory, have referred to evidence of redshift quantization as reason to reject conventional accounts of the origin and evolution of the universe.For examples, see references by nonstandard cosmology proponents  Original investigation by William G. Tifft William G. Tifft was the first to investigate possible redshift quantization, referring to it as \\"redshift-magnitude banding correlation\\". In 1973, he wrote: :\\"Using more than 200 redshifts in Coma, Perseus, and A2199, the presence of a distinct band-related periodicity in redshifts is indicated. Finally, a new sample of accurate redshifts of bright Coma galaxies on a single band is presented, which shows a strong redshift periodicity of 220 km s‚àí1. An upper limit of 20 km s‚àí1 is placed on the internal Doppler redshift component of motion in the Coma cluster\\". Tifft, now Professor Emeritus at the University of Arizona, suggested that this observation conflicted with standard cosmological scenarios. He states in summary: :\\"Throughout the development of the program it has seemed increasingly clear that the redshift has properties inconsistent with a simple velocity and/or cosmic scale change interpretation. Various implications have been pointed out from time to time, but basically the work is observationally driven.\\" Early research Studies performed in the 1980s and early 1990s produced confirmatory results: #In 1989, Martin R. Croasdale reported finding a quantization of redshifts using a different sample of galaxies in increments of 72 km/s or Œîz = (where Œîz denotes shift in frequency expressed as a proportion of initial frequency). #In 1990, Bruce Guthrie and William Napier reported finding a \\"possible periodicity\\" of the same magnitude for a slightly larger data set limited to bright spiral galaxies and excluding other types. #In 1992, Guthrie and Napier proposed the observation of a different periodicity in increments of Œîz = in a sample of 89 galaxies. #In 1992, Paal et al. and Holba et al. concluded that there was an unexplained periodicity of redshifts in a reanalysis of a large sample of galaxies. See also reference to #In 1997, Guthrie and Napier concluded the same: ::\\"So far the redshifts of over 250 galaxies with high- precision HI profiles have been used in the study. In consistently selected sub-samples of the datasets of sufficient precision examined so far, the redshift distribution has been found to be strongly quantized in the galactocentric frame of reference. ... The formal confidence levels associated with these results are extremely high.\\" Quasar redshifts Most recent discourse has focused upon whether redshift surveys of quasars (QSOs) produce evidence of quantization beyond that explainable by selection effect. This has been assisted by advances in cataloging in the late 1990s that have increased substantially the sample sizes involved in astronomical measurements. =Karlsson's formula= Historically, K. G. Karlsson and G. R. Burbidge were first to note that quasar redshifts were quantized in accordance with the empirical formula: :\\\\log_{10}(1 + z) = 0.089n - 0.0632 Where: #z refers to the magnitude of redshift (shift in frequency as a proportion of initial frequency). #n is an integer with values 1, 2, 3, 4 ... This predicts periodic redshift peaks at z = 0.061, 0.30, 0.60, 0.96, 1.41, and 1.9, observed originally in a sample of 600 quasars, verified in later early studies. =Modern discourse= A 2001 study by Burbidge and Napier found the pattern of periodicity predicted by Karlsson's formula to be present at a high confidence level in three new samples of quasars, concluding that their findings are inexplicable by spectroscopic or similar selection effects. In 2002, Hawkins et al. found no evidence for redshift quantization in a sample of 1647 galaxy-quasar pairs from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: :\\"Given that there are almost eight times as many data points in this sample as in the previous analysis by Burbidge & Napier (2001), we must conclude that the previous detection of a periodic signal arose from the combination of noise and the effects of the window function.\\" In response, Napier and Burbidge (2003) argue that the methods employed by Hawkins et al. to remove noise from their samples amount to \\"excessive data smoothing\\" which could hide a true periodicity. They publish an alternate methodology for this that preserves the periodicity observed in earlier studies. In 2005, Tang and Zhang found no evidence for redshift quantization of quasars in samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF redshift survey. Arp et al. (2005) examined sample areas in the 2dF and SDSS surveys in detail, noting that quasar redshifts: :\\"... fit very closely the long standing Karlsson formula and strongly suggest the existence of preferred values in the distribution of quasar redshifts.\\" A 2006 study of 46,400 quasars in the SDSS by Bell and McDiarmid discovered 6 peaks in the redshift distribution consistent with the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model. They conclude that this correlation is unlikely to be a selection effect, given the method used to determine intrinsic redshift relations. Schneider et al. (2007) and Richards et al. (2006) report that the periodicity reported by Bell and McDiarmid disappears after correcting for selection effects. However, Bell and Comeau (2010) have since argued that this correction removes nearly half of the sample and does not explain how selection effects give rise to redshift peaks. The same study also concludes that a \\"filter gap footprint\\" renders it impossible to verify or falsify the presence of a true redshift peak at Œîz = 0.60. A 2006 review by Bajan et al. discovered weak effects of redshift periodization in data from the Local Group of galaxies and the Hercules Supercluster. They conclude that \\"galaxy redshift periodization is an effect which can really exist\\", but that the evidence is not well established pending study of larger databases. A 2007 absorption spectroscopic analysis of quasars by Ryabinkov et al. observed a pattern of statistically significant alternating peaks and dips in the redshift range Œîz = 0.0 ‚àí 3.7, though they noted no statistical correlation between their findings and Karlsson's formula.

This process is known to remove up to 97‚Äì100% of aflatoxins from mycotoxin-contaminated corn. The term can also refer to the removal via an alkali process of the pericarp from other grains such as sorghum. Nixtamalized maize has several benefits over unprocessed grain: it is more easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, in the production of tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items. Etymology In the Aztec language Nahuatl, the word for the product of this procedure is or ( or ), which in turn has yielded Mexican Spanish (). The Nahuatl word is a compound of \\"ashes\\" and \\"unformed corn dough, tamal\\". The term nixtamalization can also be used to describe the removal of the pericarp from any grain by an alkali process, including maize, sorghum, and others. When the unaltered Spanish spelling is used in written English, however, it almost exclusively refers to maize. The labels on packages of commercially sold tortillas prepared with nixtamalized maize usually list corn treated with lime as an ingredient in English, while the Spanish versions list . History =Mesoamerica= Dried, treated maize sold in Oaxaca, Mexico (US quarter and Mexican peso shown for scale) The process of nixtamalization was first developed in Mesoamerica, where maize was originally cultivated. There is no precise date when the technology was developed, but the earliest evidence of nixtamalization is found in Guatemala's southern coast, with equipment dating from 1200‚Äì1500 BCE. How nixtamalization was discovered is not known, but one possibility may have been through the use of hot stones (see Pot boiler) to boil maize in early cultures which did not have cooking vessels robust enough to put directly on fire or coals. In limestone regions like those in Guatemala and southern Mexico, heated chunks of limestone would naturally be used, and experiments show that hot limestone makes the cooking water sufficiently alkaline to cause nixtamalization. Archaeological evidence supporting this possibility has been found in southern Utah, United States. The Aztec and Mayan civilizations developed nixtamalization using slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and ash (potassium hydroxide) to create alkaline solutions. The Chibcha people to the north of the ancient Inca also used calcium hydroxide (also known as \\"cal\\"), while the tribes of North America used naturally occurring sodium carbonate or ash. The nixtamalization process was very important in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed maize is deficient in free niacin. A population that depends on untreated maize as a staple food risks malnourishment and is more likely to develop deficiency diseases such as pellagra, niacin deficiency, or kwashiorkor, the absence of certain amino acids that maize is deficient in. Maize cooked with lime or other alkali provided niacin to Mesoamericans. Beans provided the otherwise missing amino acids required to balance maize for complete protein. The spread of maize cultivation in the Americas was accompanied by the adoption of the nixtamalization process. Traditional and contemporary regional cuisines (including Maya cuisine, Aztec cuisine, and Mexican cuisine) included, and still include, foods based on nixtamalized maize. The process has not substantially declined in usage in the Mesoamerican region, though there has been a decline in North America. Many North American Native American tribes, such as the Huron, no longer use the process. In some Mesoamerican and North American regions, dishes are still made from nixtamalized maize prepared by traditional techniques. The Hopi obtain the necessary alkali from ashes of various native plants and trees. Some contemporary Maya use the ashes of burnt mussel shells, while other Maya cook maize with small pieces of limestone. In the United States, European settlers did not always adopt the nixtamalization process, except in the case of hominy grits, though maize became a staple among the poor of the southern states. This led to endemic pellagra in poor populations throughout the southern US in the early 20th century. A more varied diet and fortification of wheat flour, the other staple food, have essentially eliminated this deficiency. dough. However, exact cooking methods vary according to use and region. =Europe, Africa, and India= Maize was introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus in the 15th century, being grown in Spain as early as 1498. Due to its high yields, it quickly spread through Europe, and later to Africa and India. Portuguese colonists grew maize in the Congo as early as 1560, and maize became, and remains, a major food crop in parts of Africa. Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not accompany the grain to Europe and beyond, perhaps because the Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize is a much less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, pellagra epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and kwashiorkor hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple. Health problems associated with maize-based diets in modern times have usually been remedied by means of vitamin supplements and economic improvement leading to a broader diet, rather than by adoption of nixtamalization. Though pellagra has vanished from Europe and the United States, it remains a major public health problem in lower Egypt, parts of South Africa, and southwestern India. Process Flowchart of the nixtamalization process. In the first step of nixtamalization, kernels of dried maize are cooked in an alkaline solution at or near the mixture's boiling point. After cooking, the maize is steeped in the cooking liquid for a period. The length of time for which the maize is boiled and soaked varies according to local traditions and the type of food being prepared, with cooking times ranging from a few minutes to an hour, and soaking times from a few minutes to about a day. During cooking and soaking, a number of chemical changes take place in the grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body. After cooking, the alkaline liquid (known as nejayote), containing dissolved hull, starch, and other corn matter, is decanted and discarded (or sometimes used for making amate bark paper). The kernels are washed thoroughly of remaining nejayote, which has an unpleasant flavor. The pericarp is then removed, leaving the endosperm of the grain with or without the germ, depending on the process. This hulling is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production. The prepared grain is called nixtamal. Nixtamal has many uses, contemporary and historic. Whole nixtamal may be used fresh or dried for later use. Whole nixtamal is used in the preparation of pozole, menudo, and other foods. Ground fresh nixtamal is made into dough and used to make tortillas, tamales, and arepas. Dried and ground, it is called masa harina or instant masa flour, and is reconstituted and used like masa. The term hominy may refer to whole, coarsely ground, or finely ground nixtamal, or to a cooked porridge (also called samp) prepared from any of these. =Enzymatic nixtamalization= An alternative process for use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground with little or no washing or hulling. By pre-soaking the maize, minimizing the alkali used to adjust the pH of the alkaline solution, reducing the cooking temperature, accelerating processing, and reusing excess processing liquids, enzymatic nixtamalization can reduce the use of energy and water, lower nejayote waste production, decrease maize lost in processing, and shorten the production time (to approximately four hours) compared to traditional nixtamalization. Effects of enzymatic nixtamalization on flavor, aroma, nutritional value, and cost, compared to traditional methods, are not well documented. Impact on health The primary nutritional benefits of nixtamalization arise from the alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's hemicellulose-bound niacin (\\"niacytin\\") to free niacin, making it available for absorption into the body, thus helping to prevent pellagra. Alkalinity also reduces the amount of the protein zein available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced. Secondary benefits can arise from the grain's absorption of minerals from the alkali used or from the vessels used in preparation. These effects can increase calcium (by 750%, with 85% available for absorption), iron, copper, and zinc. Lastly, nixtamalization significantly reduces (by 90‚Äì94%) mycotoxins produced by Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum, molds that commonly infect maize, the toxins of which are putative carcinogens.

Later that year it moved to the operation building, where it stayed until academic year of 2000/2001, when it moved to a new building, designated only to library's purposes. Over the years the number of publications grew together with increasing number of students, as well as academic and administrative staff, and has in the year of 2011 exceeded 100,000. The library collection is currently made of printed books, E-books, printed magazines, E-journals, multimedia, databases and theses. The collection has among them also many valuable books and encyclopedias, such as instance the ‚Äúƒ∞N√ñN√ú ENCYCLOPEDIA‚Äù (1946), which is the copy signed by the Prime Minister ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, and which contains the preface written by the Ministry of National Education Hasan Ali Y√ºcel. Another valuable source in the Library Collection is the book entitled ‚ÄúGAZƒ∞‚ÄôNƒ∞N ESERƒ∞: L‚Äôoeuvre du GAZƒ∞ / Jean Weinberg, 1933‚Äù. The book prepared in Turkish and French, has been printed 2 copies and the copies have been submitted by Jean Weinberg to the related institution for the correction of the mistakes. One of 2 copies of this book has been included in the library and it has been donated by Retired Major General Sƒ±tkƒ± Aydƒ±nel. Precisely because of the library's fast growth, the requirement of new library construction has arisen, to which it moved in 2013. At the end of that academic year the library collection contained 75.305 printed books, 92.625 E-books, 3.340 printed magazines and 29.325 E-publications, with which the whole collection reached total number of 203,137 publications together. The wide collection and the construction itself are one of the biggest among the libraries in Ankara to this date.

A sharp point at the end of the explorer is used to enhance tactile sensation. In the past it was usual for dentists to use the explorer to probe teeth for the presence of cavities. Some dental professionals have questioned this practice in the first decade of the twenty-first century.George Stookey \\"USE OF AN EXPLORER CAN LEAD TO MISDIAGNOSIS AND DISRUPT REMINERALIZATION\\", The Journal of the American Dental Association, November 2005, accessed November 17, 2011.George Stookey \\"The Evolution of Caries Detection\\", 2003, Dimensions of Dental Hygiene, accessed November 17, 2011. The use of a sharp explorer to diagnose caries in pit and fissure sites is no longer recommended and clinicians instead should rely on \\"sharp eyes and a blunt explorer or probe.\\" Penetration by a sharp explorer can actually cause cavitation in areas that are remineralizing or could be remineralized. Dental lesions initially develop as a subsurface lesion. Early lesions may be reversed - with meticulous patient self-care and application of fluoride - as long as the thin surface layer remains intact. The use of a dental explorer with firm pressure to probe suspicious areas may result in the rupture of the surface layer covering early lesions. Instead, they argue that fluoride and oral hygiene should be used to remineralize the enamel and prevent it from decaying further. This debate still continues because sometimes decay can be difficult to diagnose without tactile verification. Additionally, radiographs and other products designed to identify decay (such as measuring fluorescence from a laser) help the dental professional make a final diagnosis of tooth decay. There are various types of explorers, though the most common one is the No. 23 explorer, which is also known as a \\"shepherd's hook\\". Other types include the 3CH (also known as \\"cowhorn\\" or \\"pigtail\\") and No. 17 explorers, which are useful for the interproximal areas between teeth. References *Summit, James B., J.

Some have powerful jets for massage purposes. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas or by the trade name Jacuzzi. In contrast to a typical bathtub, a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation. Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet- jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs). History The earliest hot tubs were calderas in which hot stones were placed to heat the water. Therma in Ikaria has been a very popular place particularly for hydrotherapy ever since the 4th century BC.Ikaria: The Ancient Spa of Therma in Ikaria Greece, Eastern Aegean, Greeka.com. The remains of wrecked marble bathtubs along with a pre-historic aqueduct that have been unearthed from this area bear ample testimony of the place's popularity in the ancient times. In 737 A.D., Japan's first onsen opened near Izumo, Shimane, and centuries later the first ryokan (inns) were built, offering food, accommodations, and soaking tubs called ofuro. In ancient Rome there were three types of baths: baths at home (balnea), private baths (balnea privata), and public baths (balnea publica). The practice of bathing was so engrained that the Roman legions, during their long occupations in foreign lands, built their own baths at mineral and thermal springs in the newly conquered lands. Examples are found all over Europe.Schadewalt H. The history of Roman bathing culture [in Dutch]. Integraal1989;4:25‚Äì35 After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 and the rise of Christianity, cleanliness was abandoned since the Church considered that the practice of bathing a prelude to forbidden behaviour.Jackson R. Waters and spas in the classical world. Med Hist Suppl1990;10:1‚Äì13. At Cluny custom required monks to take a full bath at Christmas and Easter.Braunstein, Philippe, \\"Toward Intimacy: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries,\\" in A History of Private Life: Volume 2: Revelations of the Medieval World. Georges Duby, ed. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 1988), p. 535-632. Private bath-rooms in castles, such as the one at Leeds, could often accommodate multiple bathers.A Short History of Bathing before 1601: Washing, Baths, and in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, with sidelights on other customs From the 13th century onwards, baths gradually came into re-use, particularly in southern Europe under the influence of the Moors. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the US, inspired by the Japanese ofuro. Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi. Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells. Water treatment =Plumbing= The plumbing of the hot tub consists of: * A pressure system delivering water to the jets * A suction system returning water to the pumps. * A filtration system: the plumbing has to incorporate a filter system to help clean the water. Some models use a separate small 24/7 filter pump while others use programmed settings of the main pumps. * Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. * Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different \\"bubbly\\" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. * An ozone system: ozonation is a common adjunct to water maintenance, and if installed will have its own set of hoses and fittings. =Heating and energy use= Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. Effective insulation greatly improves the energy efficiency of a hot tub. There are several different styles of hot tub insulation: some manufacturers fill the entire cabinet with foam, while others insulate the underside of the shell, the inside of the cabinet, or both. Many manufacturers advertise the superiority of their approach to insulation, but few independent side-by-side comparisons are available. The hot tub pump and hot tub heater represent most of the power consumption in a hot tub and vary in use of power depending on their size. Energy efficiency of the tubs has been studied by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PGEC). (archived from the original on 2006-10-06). The industry has responded to the study.Katherine Wang and Joshua Keim (September 2007). Turning Up the Heat. Poolspanews.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-10. After this study, both the California Energy Commission and National Resources Canada have taken an interest in the energy efficiency of portable hot tubs (late 2006). California's portable electric hot tub listing include R values of thermal insulation, and standby watts.List of portable electric hot tubs approved for sale in California California's current appliance efficiency regulations. energy.ca.gov (2006). In 2019 an update to the ANSI standard for energy efficiency was approved. For the first time, this new standard increases the minimum energy efficiency level for portable spas and inflatable spas. Hot tub covers have been shown to reduce most of the evaporative losses from the pool when not in use. With this component of heat loss being 70% a cover with even a small R-value is able to achieve as much as a 75% reduction in heating costs when used as opposed to leaving the water surface exposed. There are several different types of spa covers. Some covers are better for insulation and therefore are lighter on internal parts and energy efficiency. Some examples of covers are insulated, aluminum, rolling, or a tonneau. =Sanitation and water quality= Since some hot tubs are not drained after each use it is necessary to treat the water to keep it attractive and safe. It must be neither too alkaline nor too acidic, and must be sanitised to stay free of harmful microorganisms. Partly due to their high water temperatures, hot tubs can pose particular health risks if not regularly maintained: outbreaks of Legionnaires' Disease have been traced to poorly sanitized hot tubs. Typically chlorine or bromine are used as sanitizers, but salt water chlorination is starting to become more common. Hot tubs should also be periodically shocked, which means oxidizing or breaking down organic material left behind from the sanitizer, as well as non-filterable material such as soap films and perspiration. Sanitation can also be aided by a non-chemical ozonator. For aesthetic reasons, and for the sanitizer to work properly, water should be neither too alkaline nor too acidic (low pH). The hardness level of the water, measured as the amount of dissolved calcium, is also important. Insufficient hardness can lead to corrosion and water foaming. Types Wooden hot tub on a trailer, Finland. * Portable vinyl-liner hot tub: these are cheaper and smaller, and require less power, e.g. 110‚Äì120 V 15 A household power circuits in North America. * Roto-molded hot tubs are constructed with the shell and surrounding cabinet as a single piece. They have molded seating. * Acrylic: these hot tubs have a cast acrylic shell, supported by a frame structure, and are usually surrounded by a skirt of either cedar or simulated wood-grain plastic. They typically can seat two to seven persons or more. * Cement: hot tubs can also be built of cement, above-ground, or in-ground like a small swimming pool. * Wooden hot tubs: round wooden hot tubs peaked in popularity in the 1970s, having now been replaced by modern construction methods. Wooden hot tubs are often made of redwood or cedar and assembled from vertical staves and the structure is held together like wooden barrels, with metal bands. * Stainless steel hot tubs can be made in any shape and size and are extremely durable. * Glasfiber hot tub: glass reinforced polyester (GRP) hot tubs have made of a plastic matrix reinforced by fine fibers of glass. * Inflatable PVC hot tubs. An inflatable hot tub is an air-filled spa structure. Air is pumped into a vinyl skin that expands and creates a solid form. Most commonly round in shape. Safety Sitting in water above normal body temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness and subsequently result in drowning. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that water temperatures never exceed 40 degrees Celsius. A temperature of 37 degrees is considered safe for a healthy adult. Soaking in water above 39 degrees Celsius can cause fetal damage during the first three months of pregnancy. It is also recommended to install residual-current devices for protection against electrocution. The greater danger associated with electrical shock in the water is that the person may be rendered immobile and unable to rescue themselves or to call for help and then drown. Hot tubs and spas are equipped with drains that can create powerful suction and between 1980 and 1996, the CPSC had reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs, about one-third of which were drownings to children under age five. In the same period 18 incidents were reported to the CPSC involving body part entrapment. To reduce the risk of entrapment, US safety standards require that each spa have two drains for each pump, reducing the amount of suction. From 1999 to 2007 there were 26 reports to the CPSC concerning circulation entrapments hot tubs and spas, including three deaths. In 2001 and in 2012 the CPSC issued recalls for spa heaters which overheated and caused fires. The Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code is a model code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) to govern the installation and inspection of plumbing systems associated with swimming pools, spas and hot tubs as a means of promoting the public's health, safety and welfare. Disease risk Poorly sanitized hot-tubs have been linked to a number of diseases, principally caused by facultative anaerobic bacteria. Such incidents include hot tub folliculitis and legionellosis.

It is located north-east of the inner city of Sarajevo and was established in May 1952 with the organization of people's committees. Those local people's committees founded the local municipalities, which led to self-management of the municipalities, including the municipality of Ilija≈°.Ilijas.ba  History  In the early Middle Ages close to the river Bosna and Vogo≈°ƒçica the district Vogo≈°ƒáa or Vidogo≈°ƒáa was formed. Some later events that are tied to the Ottoman period came to the formation of d≈æemats, nahiyahs and sanjaks. In the beginning of the nineteenth century there were 20 d≈æemats in the Sarajevo Nahiyah: Butmir, Kijevo, Presjenica, Sudiƒái, Trnovo, Zijamet Crna Rijeka, Pale, Mokro with Bobogoviƒáima, Kriva Rijeka, Srednje, ƒåifluk Crna Rijeka, Rakova Noga, Vogo≈°ƒáa, Nahorevo, Kulijes, Rakovica, Had≈æiƒái, Drozgometva, Pazariƒá and the villages of Luka i ≈Ωeravica. The occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire led to many changes which manifested to administrative and political changes. The territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was divided into districts and further divided into counties. The counties were divided into municipalities, instead of dzemats, and they were furthermore divided into mahallahs and hamlets while the functions of the muhtars and village chiefs remained the same. The modern municipality of Ilija≈° at that time was divided into the Sarajevo and Visoko counties and the boundary line between these two counties was the Povuƒçje stream and the hill Bukovac which was between the stream and Ljubina. The administrative division of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the formation of bans in 1929 remained the same even during the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Only after 1922 oblasts were formed instead of districts. Everything remained the same until 1941. Right after the freeing of the temporary national assembly of the Federal Bosnia and Herzegovina the assembly's first session in August 1945 brought up the law of the territorial division of Bosnia and Herzegovina in districts, counties and areas of local people's committees and their headquarters. Demographics The municipality of Ilija≈° is composed of two parts, the town of Ilija≈° and the upper municipality. The town of Ilija≈° is composed by several localities. The biggest and most urban is the center and it has about 10,000 residents, the second is the settlement of Misoƒça (Naselje Misoƒça), with 1500 residents. Ethnically, there is a majority of Bosniaks with about 1300 people, 250 are Serbs, 50 are Croats, with none classified as others.

Cinema Novo formed in response to class and racial unrest both in Brazil and the United States. Influenced by Italian neorealism and French New Wave, films produced under the ideology of Cinema Novo opposed traditional Brazilian cinema, which consisted primarily of musicals, comedies and Hollywood-style epics.Johnson & Stam, 33. Glauber Rocha is widely regarded as Cinema Novo's most influential filmmaker.Gazetas, 308.Johnson & Stam, 42.Dixon & Foster, 292. Today, the movement is often divided into three sequential phases that differ in tone, style and content. Origins =Background= In the 1950s, Brazilian cinema was dominated by chanchada (musicals, often comedic and \\"cheap\\"Viany, 141.), big-budget epics that imitated the style of Hollywood, and \\"'serious' cinema\\" that Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues characterizes as \\"sometimes cerebral and often ridiculously pretentious.\\"Johnson & Stam, 65. This traditional cinema was supported by foreign producers, distributors and exhibitors. As the decade ended, young Brazilian filmmakers protested films they perceived as made in \\"bad taste and ... sordid commercialism, ... a form of cultural prostitution\\" that relied on the patronage of \\"an illiterate and impoverished Brazil.\\" Cinema Novo became increasingly political. In the 1960s, Brazil was producing the most political cinema in South America. Brazil therefore became the natural ‚Äúhome of the Cinema Novo (New Cinema) movement‚Äù. Cinema Novo rose to prominence at the same time that progressive Brazilian Presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and later Jo√£o Goulart took office and began to influence Brazilian popular culture. But it was not until 1959 or 1960 that 'Cinema Novo' emerged as a label for the movement. According to Randal Johnson and Robert Stam, Cinema Novo officially began in 1960, with the start of its first phase.Johnson & Stam, 32. In 1961, the Popular Center of Culture, a subsidiary of the National Students' Union, released Cinco Vezes Favela, a film serialized in five episodes that Johnson and Stam claim to be \\"one of the first\\" products of the Cinema Novo movement.Johnson & Stam, 58. The Popular Center of Culture (PCC) sought \\"to establish a cultural and political link with the Brazilian masses by putting on plays in factories and working-class neighborhoods, producing films and records, and by participating in literacy programs.\\" Johnson and Stam hold that \\"many of the original members of Cinema Novo\\" were also active members in the PCC who participated in the production of Cinco Vezes Favela. =Influences= Brazilian filmmakers modeled Cinema Novo after genres known for subversiveness: Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Johnson and Stam further claim that Cinema Novo has something in common \\"with Soviet film of the twenties,\\" which like Italian neorealism and French New Wave had \\"a penchant for theorizing its own cinematic practice.\\"Johnson & Stam, 55. Italian neorealist cinema often shot on location with nonprofessional actors and depicted working class citizens during the hard economic times following World War II. French New Wave drew heavily from Italian neorealism, as New Wave directors rejected classical cinema and embraced iconoclasm. Some proponents of Cinema Novo were \\"scornful of the politics of the [French] New Wave\\", viewing its tendency to stylistically copy Hollywood as elitist. But Cinema Novo filmmakers were largely attracted to French New Wave's use of auteur theory, which enabled directors to make low- budget films and develop personal fan bases. Ideology Cinema Novo filmmaker Alex Viany describes the movement as having elements of participatory culture. According to Viany, while Cinema Novo was initially \\"as fluid and undefined\\" as its predecessor French New Wave, it required that filmmakers have a passion for cinema, a desire to use it to explain \\"social and human problems,\\" and a willingness to individualize their work. Auteur theory also greatly influenced Cinema Novo. Although its three phases were distinct, Cinema Novo encouraged directors to emphasize their personal politics and stylistic preferences. As Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade explained to Viany in a 1966 interview: > In our films, the propositions, positions, and ideas are extremely varied, > at times even contradictory or at least multiple. Above all they are > increasingly free and unmasked. There exists a total freedom of expression. > ... At first glance this would seem to indicate some internal incoherence > within the Cinema Novo movement. But in reality I think it indicates a > greater coherence: a more legitimate, truthful, and direct correspondence > between the filmmaker--with his perplexities, doubts, and certainties--and > the world in which he lives.Johnson & Stam, 75. Class struggle also informed Cinema Novo, whose strongest theme is the \\"aesthetic of hunger\\" developed by premiere Cinema Novo filmmaker Glauber Rocha in the first phase. Rocha wished to expose how different the standard of living was for rich South Americans and poor South Americans. In his 1965 essay \\"The Esthetic of Hunger,\\" Rocha stated that \\"the hunger of South America is not simply an alarming symptom: it is the essence of our society. ... [Cinema Novo's] originality is [South Americans'] hunger[,] and our greatest misery is that this hunger is felt but not intellectually understood.\\"Johnson & Stam, 70. On this note, Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster hold that \\"[t]he Marxist implications of [Rocha's] cinema are hard to miss\\".Dixon & Foster, 292-293. Themes and style Most film historians divide Cinema Novo into three sequential phases that differ in theme, style and subject matter. Stam and Johnson identify \\"a first phase going from 1960 to 1964,\\" a second phase running \\"from 1964 to 1968,\\" and a third phase running \\"from 1963 to 1972\\" (though they also claim the final phase concludes at \\"roughly\\" \\"the end of 1971\\").Stam & Johnson. There is little disagreement among film critics about this time frame.Xavier, 372-373.Rodr√≠guez, 108.King, 113.Dennison & Shaw, 133. Filmmaker Carlos Diegues claims that while lack of funds lowered the technical precision of Cinema Novo films, it also allowed directors, writers and producers to have an unusual amount of creative freedom. \\"Because Cinema Novo is not a school, it has no established style,\\" states Diegues. \\"In Cinema Novo, expressive forms are necessarily personal and original without formal dogmas\\". This directorial freedom, along with the changing social and political climate in Brazil, caused Cinema Novo to experience shifts in form and content in a short amount of time. =First phase (1960‚Äì1964)= Films of the first phase represent the original motivation and goals of Cinema Novo. First-phase films were earnest in tone and rural in setting, dealing with social ills that affected the working class like starvation, violence, religious alienation and economic exploitation. They also addressed the \\"fatalism and stoicism\\" of the working class, which discouraged it from working to fix these problems. \\"The films share a certain political optimism,\\" write Johnson and Stam, \\"a kind of faith that merely showing these problems would be a first step toward their solution.\\"Johnson & Stam, 34. Unlike traditional Brazilian cinema that depicted beautiful professional actors in tropical paradises, first-phase Cinema Novo \\"searched out the dark corners of Brazilian life--its favelas and its sert√£o--the places where Brazil's social contradictions appeared most dramatically.\\" These topics were supported by aesthetics that \\"were visually characterized by a documentary quality, often achieved by the use of a hand-held camera\\" and were shot \\"in black and white, using simple, stark scenery that vividly emphasized the harshness of the landscape\\". Diegues contends that first-phase Cinema Novo did not focus on editing and shot-framing but rather on spreading a proletariat philosophy. \\"Brazilian filmmakers (principally in Rio, Bahia, and S√£o Paulo) have taken their cameras and gone out into the streets, the country, and the beaches in search of the Brazilian people, the peasant, the worker, the fisherman, the slum dweller.\\"Johnson & Stam, 66. Most film historians agree that Glauber Rocha, \\"one of the most well-known and prolific filmmakers to emerge in the late 1950s in Brazil\\",Hollyman, 9. was the most powerful advocate for Cinema Novo in its first phase. Dixon and Foster contend that Rocha helped initiate the movement because he wanted to make films that educated the public about social equality, art and intellectualism, which Brazilian cinema at the time did not do. Rocha summarized these goals by claiming his films used \\"aesthetics of hunger\\" to address class and racial unrest. In 1964, Rocha released Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (\\"Black God, White Devil\\"), which he wrote and directed to ‚Äúsuggest that only violence will help those who are sorely oppressed\\". With Rocha at the helm during its first phase, Cinema Novo was praised by critics around the world. =Second phase (1964‚Äì1968)= In 1964, popular Democratic President Jo√£o Goulart was removed from office by military coup, turning Brazil into a military-run autocracy under new President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. Brazilians consequently lost faith in the ideals of Cinema Novo, as the movement had promised to protect civilian rights yet had failed to uphold democracy. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade blamed fellow directors, whom he claimed had lost touch with Brazilians while appealing to critics: \\"For a film to be a truly political instrument,\\" de Andrade said, \\"it must first communicate with its public\\".Johnson & Stam, 73. Second-phase Cinema Novo thus sought to both deflect criticism and to address the \\"anguish\\" and \\"perplexity\\" that Brazilians felt after Goulart was ousted. It did this by producing films that were \\"analyses of failure--of populism, of developmentalism, and of leftist intellectuals\\" to protect Brazilian democracy.Johnson & Stam, 35-36. At this time, filmmakers also started trying to make Cinema Novo more profitable. Stephanie Dennison and Lisa Shaw state that second-phase directors \\"recognized the irony in making so-called 'popular' films, to be viewed only by university students and art-house aficionados. As a result, some auteurs began to move away from the so-called 'aesthetics of hunger' toward a filmmaking style and themes designed to attract the interest of the cinema- going public at large.\\"Dennison & Shaw, 134. As a result, the first Cinema Novo film to be shot in color and to depict middle-class protagonists was released during this time: Leon Hirzshman's Garota de Ipanema (\\"Girl from Ipanema,\\" 1968). =Third phase and Cinema Marginal (1968‚Äì1972)= Hans Proppe and Susan Tarr characterize Cinema Novo's third phase as \\"a mixed bag of social and political themes against a backdrop of characters, images and contexts not unlike the richness and floridness of the Brazilian jungle\\".Proppe & Tarr. Third-phase Cinema Novo has also been called \\"the cannibal-tropicalist phase\\"Johnson & Stam, 37. or simply the \\"tropicalist\\" phase. Tropicalism was a movement that focused on kitsch, bad taste and gaudy colors. Film historians refer to cannibalism both literally and metaphorically. Both types of cannibalism are visible in Como Era Gostoso o Meu Frances (\\"How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman,\\" 1971), in which the protagonist is abducted and eaten by literal cannibals at the same time it is \\"suggested that the Indians (i.e., Brazil) should metaphorically cannibalize their foreign enemies, appropriating their force without being dominated by them.\\" Rocha believed cannibalism represented the violence that was necessary to enact social change and depict it onscreen: \\"From Cinema Novo it should be learned that an aesthetic of violence, before being primitive, is revolutionary. It is the initial moment when the colonizer becomes aware of the colonized. Only when confronted with violence does the colonizer understand, through horror, the strength of the culture he exploits.\\" With Brazil modernizing in the global economy, third-phase Cinema Novo also became more polished and professional, producing \\"films in which the rich cultural texture of Brazil has been pushed to the limit and exploited for its own aesthetic ends rather than for its appropriateness as political metaphor.\\" Brazilian consumers and filmmakers began to feel that Cinema Novo was contradicting the ideals of its first phase. This perception led to the birth of Cinema Marginal, also called Udigrudi cinema or Novo Cinema Novo, which used 'dirty screen' and 'garbage' aesthetics to return Cinema Novo to its original focus on marginalized characters and social problems, all while appropriating elements of b-movies and pornochanchadas to reach a wider, working-class audience. But third-phase Cinema Novo also had supporters. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, who was active during the first phase and produced one of the premiere films of the third phase, Macuna√≠ma, was pleased Cinema Novo had made itself more relatable to Brazilian citizens, despite accusations it was selling out to do so. Referencing Leon Hirszman's Garota de Ipanema, de Andrade praised Hirszman for using \\"a popular stereotype to establish contact with the masses, while at the same time ... demystif[ying] that very stereotype\\".Johnson & Stam, 74. End of Cinema Novo Burnes St. Patrick Hollyman, son of famed American photographer Thomas Hollyman, states that \\"by 1970, many of the cinema novo films had won numerous awards at international festivals\\".Hollyman, 96. In 1970 Rocha published a manifesto on the progress of Cinema Novo, in which he said he was pleased that Cinema Novo \\"had gained critical acceptance as part of world cinema\\" and had become \\"a nationalist cinema that accurately reflected the artistic and ideological concerns of the Brazilian people\\" (Hollyman). But Rocha also warned filmmakers and consumers that being too complacent in the achievements of Cinema Novo would return Brazil to its pre-Cinema Novo state: > The movement is bigger than any one of us. But the young should know that > they cannot be irresponsible about the present and the future because > today's anarchy can be tomorrow's slavery. Before long, imperialism will > start to exploit the newly created films. If the Brazilian cinema is the > palm tree of Tropicalism, it is important that the people who have lived > through the drought are on guard to make sure that Brazilian cinema doesn't > become underdeveloped.Qtd. on Hollyman, 97. Rocha's fears were realized. In 1977, filmmaker Carlos Diegues said that \\"one can only talk about Cinema Novo in nostalgic or figurative terms because Cinema Novo as a group no longer exists, above all because it has been diluted into Brazilian cinema.\\"Johnson & Stam, 100. Toward the end of Cinema Novo, the Brazilian government created film company Embrafilme to encourage production of Brazilian cinema; but Embrafilme mostly produced films that ignored the Cinema Novo ideology. Aristides Gazetas claims that Third Cinema now carries on the Cinema Novo tradition.Gazetas, 306. Legacy =Embrafilme= In 1969, the Brazilian government instituted Embrafilme, a company designed to produce and distribute Brazilian cinema. Embrafilme produced movies of various genres, including fantasies and big-budget epics. At the time, Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues said he supported Embrafilme because it was \\"the only enterprise with sufficient economic and political power to confront the devastating voracity of the multinational corporations in Brazil.\\" Moreover, Diegues held that while Cinema Novo \\"is not identified with Embrafilme\\", \\"[Embrafilme's] existence ... is in reality a project of Cinema Novo.\\" When Embrafilme was dismantled in 1990 by President Fernando Collor de Mello, \\"the consequences\\" for the Brazilian film industry \\"were immediate and grim.\\"R√™go, 35. Lacking investors, many Brazilian directors co-produced English films. This caused English cinema to overrun the Brazilian market, which went from producing 74 films in 1989 to producing nine films in 1993. Brazilian President Itamar Franco ended the crisis by implementing the Brazilian Cinema Rescue Award, which funded 90 projects between 1993 and 1994. The award \\"opened new doors to a young generation of new film-makers (and a few of the veterans) who were confident that, as the title of a film by Cinema Novo veteran director Carlos Diegues prophetically announced, better days would come (Melhores Dias Virao/Better Days Will Come, 1989).\\"R√™go, 37-38. =Third Cinema= According to Aristides Gazetas, Cinema Novo is the first example of an influential genre called Third Cinema. Like Cinema Novo, Third Cinema draws on Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Gazetas claims that Cinema Novo can be characterized as early Third Cinema because Glauber Rocha \\"adopted Third Cinema techniques to bring awareness of the social and political realities in his country through cinema\\". After fading with Cinema Novo, Third Cinema was revived in 1986 when English film companies looked to create a genre that \\"focused upon Anglo-American cinematic practices\\" and \\"avoided both the sentimental leftist cultural theory emanating from the UK and the cultural and educational practices in line with corporate cultures and market consumerism that related to variants of postmodernism.\\" In 1965, Glauber Rocha claimed that \\"Cinema Novo is a phenomenon of new peoples everywhere and not a privilege of Brazil.\\" Appropriately, Third Cinema has affected film culture throughout the world. In Italy, Gillo Pontecorvo directed The Battle of Algiers (1965), which depicted native African Muslims as brave terrorists fighting French colonialists in Algeria. Cuban filmmaker Tomas Gutierrez Alea, co-founder of the ground-breaking Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos, used Third Cinema to \\"reconstitut[e] a historical past for Cubans.\\"Gazetas, 309. According to Stuart Hall, Third Cinema also impacted black peoples in the Caribbean by giving them two identities: one in which they are unified across a diaspora, and another that highlights \\"what black people have become as a result of white rule and colonization.\\"Gazetas, 310.

He founded and led the Ligue Antisemitique, an organisation similar to the Ligue des Patriotes, and edited the French weekly L'Antijuif (fr) (Paris, 1896-1902). At the start of March 1898 Gu√©rin was among the speakers attacking Jews and their \\"Dreyfusard servants\\" at a meeting of 800 people in the Salle Wagram in Paris. Other speakers were Charles Devos, √âdouard Duboc and Max R√©gis. The Ligue was involved in many anti-Semitic and anti-Dreyfus protests during the Dreyfus Affair. After failing to gain financial backing from Radical and Socialist politicians for his anti-Semitic league and newspaper, he turned to royalists and announced himself an opponent of the Republican government. Gu√©rin was financially supported by Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, the Orleanist claimant to the French throne, from 1898 to 1903. In 1899 Gu√©rin was involved in the activities of Paul D√©roul√®de, who attempted to organise a coup-d'etat. He was eventually indicted, with D√©roul√®de and his Ligue des Patriotes for conspiring against the State. Gu√©rin refused to be taken and fortified his house in the Rue Chabrol with a group of armed supporters. After 23 days of siege, he eventually gave himself up. The term \\"Fort Chabrol\\" for a siege situation is still in use in some French- speaking countries, even among law enforcement agencies. The Ligue was outlawed in November 1899 and Gu√©rin was imprisoned for ten years.

It opened on April 11, 1936, and since 1964 has been operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It currently includes two physically isolated networks: one serving the towns of Cambridge, Belmont, and Watertown, the otherthe Silver Line (Waterfront)located in the city of Boston proper. Prior to 1964, several additional trolleybus lines were in operation in Boston proper. Measured by fleet size, the system was the third-largest trolleybus system in the United States at its peak (end of 1952), with only the Chicago and Atlanta systems having more trolleybuses than Boston's 463. In the present system, four routes fan out from the Harvard bus tunnel at Harvard Square station, running through Cambridge, Belmont, and Watertown. Those lines are the remains of a once- extensive system of trackless trolleys in the area, which was largely formed from former streetcar lines. Additionally, the 2004-opened Silver Line (Waterfront) is a bus rapid transit service using dual-mode buses which run as trolleybuses in the Waterfront tunnel. History Pullman-Standard trolleybuses at North Cambridge Carhouse in 1967 The first trackless trolley line in the Boston transit system was opened by the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) on April 11, 1936. Replacing a streetcar line over the same route, it was an unnumbered crosstown line running from Harvard station east to Lechmere station. (Substitution of buses for streetcars on the route had been proposed as early as 1930.) Additional lines were opened in 1937, and by 1942, the system had 14 lines, of which 10 were former streetcar lines and four were former motor bus lines. In 1947, the BERy was succeeded by the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) as the operator of Boston's urban transit system, and in 1964, the MTA was replaced by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which remains the system's operator today. The BERy was owned by private investors, but came under public control from 1918. It served 13 municipalities of Greater Boston, including Boston proper. The MTA's service area was limited to these municipalities (with the addition of Revere). Following a change of management, the MTA began replacing trolleybuses with motorbuses, starting in 1958. Only four trolleybus lines remained after 1963, all based in Cambridge. Four decades later, the MTA's successor, the MBTA, built the Silver Line (Waterfront), and that line's opening in late 2004 reintroduced trolleybus service in Boston proper. At the trolleybus system's peak, the maximum number of trolleybus routes in operation was 37, with most route running in the near north suburbs of Boston. In addition, there were the disconnected Dorchester and Arborway networks. Prior to the opening of the Silver Line, a total of 43 trolleybus lines had historically existed, but not all concurrently, making the all-time total 44 with route SL1, . Harvard-based routes =History= Flyer trolleybus in the upper level of the Harvard bus tunnel in 2003 What became the Harvard- based trolleybus system began as branches of the Cambridge Railroad, a horsecar street railway that opened in 1856. Lines from Harvard Square to Mount Auburn via Brattle Street and Porter Square opened soon after the Harvard Square‚ÄìBowdoin Square route. The connecting Watertown Horse Railroad opened on April 27, 1857. The Porter Square branch was extended to the border of West Cambridge (now Arlington); there it met the West Cambridge Horse Railroad, which opened on June 13, 1859. In 1880, the Watertown line was extended south on Galen Street to Nonantum Square. The Harvard‚ÄìArlington line was electrified on July 1, 1889 ‚Äì one of the first lines converted by the West End Street Railway. Electric service between Watertown and Mount Auburn began on December 12, 1893; the line was double-tracked later in the decade. Residents of Brattle Street objected to the construction of electric lines; in October 1893, the Board of Railway Commissioners denied the West End permission to run electric streetcars on Brattle Street. That November, a compromise was worked out where the West End would instead build on Mount Auburn Street (which had been considered in 1891 ); the line on Concord Avenue and Huron Avenue would be opened within eight months, and the Brattle Street horsecar tracks removed in the same time frame. The Mount Auburn line opened in April or May 1894, with the Concord/Huron line opening later in the year. A branch from Mount Auburn to Waverley Square in Belmont opened on October 1, 1898, despite Watertown's opposition earlier than year to widening Belmont Street. A branch to Belmont Center opened on June 30, 1906; it was replaced by buses in August 1928 and was never a trackless trolley route. The four surviving Harvard-based routes remained after much of the system was converted to diesel and exist, in part, because of the necessity to limit the number of diesel buses in the Harvard bus tunnel. Inside the portals, the tunnel splits into two one-way tunnels, upper and lower. The tunnel for eastbound-northbound vehicles is placed on top of the tunnel for southbound-westbound vehicles.Priestley, John (July‚ÄìAugust 1988). \\"North American Safari: Part 3\\". Trolleybus Magazine, pp. 83‚Äì88. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . The tunnels first opened for streetcars in 1912, and trolleybuses began using them in 1938. Streetcar service using the tunnel was abandoned in 1958. In a six- year project lasting from 1979 to 1985 (coinciding with the reconstruction of Harvard station during the Northwest Extension of the MBTA Red Line), the tunnel was closed for an extensive rebuilding, which included new platforms and a new northern portal ramp. =Vehicles= Flyer E800 trolleybus at Cambridge Common, followed by the newer Neoplan AN-440LF trolleybus In the lower/westbound tunnel, the loading platforms are located on the left side of the roadway, and for this reason the trolleybuses serving this station have always been equipped with left-side doors, in addition to the normal righthand doors, as state DPU regulations discourage boarding passengers from doors facing the wall rather than the platform. Diesel buses serving the tunnel are not equipped with left-side doors, and passengers boarding or deboarding at the westbound stop must cross the roadway to reach the buses' doors.Priestley, John (July‚ÄìAugust 1988). \\"North American Safari: Part 3\\". Trolleybus Magazine, pp. 83‚Äì88. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . In 2004, the MBTA began receiving a fleet of new trolleybuses from Neoplan USA, to replace Flyer E800 trolleybuses dating from 1976. The newer vehicles are low-floor vehicles and meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards (see MBTA accessibility). =Current operations= The vehicles are all stored overnight at the North Cambridge Carhouse, the northern terminus of the 77A route. Trackless trolleys do not run on Sundays; instead, diesel buses cover the routes. To expedite passenger boarding through a left-side door in the southbound Harvard bus tunnel, the 71 and 73 trackless trolley routes allow free entry for outbound trips, collecting fare upon later passenger exit from the vehicle. Diesel buses lack a left-side door, so on Sundays these buses are boarded in the northbound tunnel. 71 The #71 route terminates at Watertown Square The 71 Watertown Square‚ÄìHarvard station begins at the Harvard bus tunnel lower level and leaves via the south exit onto Mount Auburn Street. It heads west into Watertown, ending at Watertown Square. At the Harvard end, to turn around, the trackless trolley exits the tunnel and makes a hard left onto Massachusetts Avenue and a right on Garden Street, and then turns right on Waterhouse Street and right on Massachusetts Avenue to return to the tunnel. The Watertown end has a loop on private right-of-way for turning around and picking up/dropping off passengers. September 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 71; trackless trolleys have run since then. On December 22, 2019, additional reverse-peak short turns were added. These trips serve Mount Auburn Hospital and return trolleybuses to the route 72 terminals for its peak-direction-only service. 72 The 72 Aberdeen Avenue‚ÄìHarvard station starts on the upper level and comes out the north end of the tunnel, using the path that the 71 uses to turn around. However, at the intersection of Garden and Waterhouse Streets, the 72 heads west on Garden Street, Concord Avenue and Huron Avenue and south on Aberdeen Avenue to end at Mount Auburn Street, intersecting the 71 and 73. To turn around, the 72 leaves the south portal of the tunnel and turns left on Mount Auburn Street. It turns right on Eliot Street, right on Bennett Street and right on a private right-of-way called Bennett Alley to go straight across Mount Auburn Street into the tunnel. At the west end, the 72 simply makes a U-turn across the wide median of Aberdeen Avenue. On Saturday evenings and Sundays, the 72 is combined with the 75 bus and the route extends to Belmont Center as a diesel bus (signed as route 72/75). Streetcars last ran on the 72 on April 1, 1938; trackless trolleys have been running since then. In March 2013, the route was temporarily replaced with diesel buses to permit roadwork on Huron Avenue and reconstruction of the Conductor's Building in Bennett Alley. It will return to electric operation when construction is complete. However, route 72 was reduced to peak-direction, peak-hour-only service on December 22, 2019 in conjunction with improvements to routes 74 and 75 (which also run on Concord Avenue). 73 The 73 Waverley Square‚ÄìHarvard station follows the same route as the 71 in Cambridge. It leaves Mt. Auburn St. to follow Belmont Street, which forms a border between Belmont and Watertown, then continues on Trapelo Road in Belmont to end at Waverley Square, with a loop at the Waverley commuter rail station on the Fitchburg Line. A short-turn loop exists at Benton Square, the intersection of Belmont Street and Trapelo Road. September 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 73 (and 71 and 77A), after which trackless trolleys have run. As a streetcar line, the turnback loop was further west along Trapelo Road at Cushing Square. Streetcars first ran to Waverley Square on October 1, 1898. In September 2013, the route was converted to diesel buses for two years to permit diversions during roadway reconstruction in Belmont. Trackless trolley service was restored in December 2016. A small number of Benton Square short turns (added to the schedule in March 2016) continue to operate as diesel buses. 77A The 77A is a short-turn trip of the 77 Arlington Heights‚ÄìHarvard station bus route. It is not a full-service route; it is primarily a designation for route 71 and 73 trolleybuses to run in revenue service while pulling in or out of the North Cambridge Carhouse. The route was originally a full-service short turn route; however, it became less necessary after the Red Line was extended to Porter and Davis stations in 1984. Since January 2005, the only 77A trips are pull- ins and pull-outs to take 71 and 73 buses to or from the carhouse. They are listed in the 77 schedule. September 4, 1958, was the last day of streetcar service on the 77A, after which trackless trolleys have run. (Route 77 had already been running diesel buses since 1955.) Until around 1967, the route was numbered 82. Silver Line Dual-mode bus in electric mode at the top of the Silver Line tunnel ramp A Silver Line dual-mode bus changes from electric to diesel mode at Silver Line Way The Silver Line is split into two sections; the diesel-electric hybrid Washington Street section runs entirely on the surface, but the Waterfront section runs through a dedicated tunnel under the South Boston Waterfront, in which diesel emissions would be problematic. Several routes branch out from the tunnel along routings where installation of overhead trolley wire would have been impractical, especially through the Ted Williams Tunnel (as overhead wires are expressly prohibited on interstate highways), so the Waterfront section uses dual-mode buses. The vehicles run as trolleybuses within the tunnel, then change to diesel power at Silver Line Way, and reverse the transition when inbound. Motor buses are not permitted to operate inside the South Boston Waterfront tunnel due to insufficient ventilation. Four routes run in the electrified Silver Line tunnel: SL1 to Logan Airport, SL2 to Design Center, SL3 to Chelsea, and a shuttle route which short turns at Silver Line Way. Until early 2006, the Silver Line also used some of the then-new Neoplan trackless trolleys until the entire dual-mode fleet could be placed into service. Later that year, the Neoplan trackless trolleys were transferred to the Harvard-based routes to replace the then- remaining Flyer trolleybuses. Fleet =Past fleet= Boston's first trolleybuses were built by Pullman-Standard in 1936. Boston Elevated continued to buy its trolleybuses almost exclusively from Pullman, and until 1950 Pullmans comprised the entire fleet with the exception of a small batch of five Twin Coach trolleybuses purchased in 1937. In 1952, Boston had more Pullman-built trolleybuses than any other city, with 438. Meanwhile, 25 ACF- Brill trolleybuses built in 1950 were the only other purchase of non-Pullman trolleybuses until 1976. With several route closures in 1964, the Twin Coaches and the oldest Pullmans were retired, leaving only Pullmans built in 1947‚Äì51 in service. These were all replaced in 1976 by a fleet of 50 Flyer E800s. The Flyers were, in turn, replaced by new trolleybuses over the period 2004‚Äì06. =Current fleet= The present fleet is made up of low-floor vehicles built by Neoplan USA and fitted with ≈†koda electrical equipment. There are two distinct groups: The network serving Cambridge and vicinity uses a fleet of 28 vehicles, while the Silver Line (Waterfront) uses a fleet of 32 articulated dual-mode buses which are extended-length. The Cambridge trolleybuses (numbered 4101‚Äì4128) were delivered in 2004 and were the first low-floor trolleybuses in North America.Box, Roland (July‚ÄìAugust 2010). \\"More about the 2000s\\".

History  The band began by recording two demos, titled Mysterious Realms and Through The Ages We Preserve.... Both were recorded onto cassette format. These demos were enough to get them signed onto Napalm Records and a split CD with the folk metal band Angizia was made as their debut release. Also entitled Mysterious Realms, the split CD was released in 1996. However the band themselves were experiencing difficulties, and maintaining a constant line-up proved a problem. After releasing the mini-CD H√∂llentanz in 1997, the band decided to part ways. This split also marked the end of their relationship with Napalm Records. Tharen went on to form the innovative neoclassical band Dargaard, and the industrial band Dominion III, but in 1998 his interest in black metal was rekindled and he decided to reform the band. He got in touch with Herr Wolf who agreed to join the band in winter 1998 on guitars; shortly thereafter, Silenius (vocals) and Lanz (guitar and bass) completed the line-up with Tharen on drums and keyboards. Thurisaz left the band to eventually take over vocal and bass guitar responsibilities for Abigor. The band released a promotional CD in 2000 titled Remembering Ancient Origins; it was a collection of songs previously unreleased from 1995 to 1999. It was limited to 100 copies and was released by the band personally with no record label involvement. This CD is now out of print. The band's most recent release is a split CD with Hellbound, entitled Nebelung, 1384, released in 2002 through their new label Millennium Metal Music. At this time there is no new news about any future releases, except a short news piece on their official site that mentions two new mini-CD projects. Tharen recently commented that the band may well be coming to an end soon. He claims that the band have not had contact in a while, and have not been working on new material. However he claims to be in communication with Thurisaz again after the split, and a possibility of a new line-up may be announced soon.

People therefore built a temple to house Che Kung in Sha Tin, and the epidemic subsided on the day the construction of the temple was completed.Che Kung Temple, Sha Tin, on the Chinese Temples Committee website According to oral traditions, the Che Kung Temple at Sha Tin was founded from Ho Chung, when the god was \\"invited\\" from the existing Che Kung Temple in Ho Chung to Sha Tin. The original temple was first built at the end of the Ming Dynasty and was renovated in 1890, 1993 and 2004.

Other deities worshipped at the temple include Hung Shing, Tin Hau and Choi Pak Shing Kun (). Run by villagers for over 300 years, the temple is now being kept by Wan Sai Cheung of the Wan family who have been residents in Ho Chung village for many generations. While the temple has been renovated several times, it is considered that \\"the authenticity [of the building] is in general kept\\". Known renovation dates include 1908, 1994 and 2002, while other sources also mention 1934 and 2000. It was listed as a Grade II historic building in 1996, and as a Grade I historic building in 2009.

Che Kung festival or the Birthday of Che Kung is the day when people celebrate the birth of Che Kung. On this day, people, especially Hongkongers, would like to go to Che Kung Temple and worship Che Kung. Che Kung was a military commander in Southern Song dynasty. He protected the Emperor Bing of Song to escape Mongol invaders and considered as loyalty to the emperors. The real birthday of Che Kung is 2 January in the Chinese lunar calendar. Nevertheless, people prefer the next day to celebrate his birthday. =Procedures of the festival celebration= Drum of Heaven Wheeling the Golden Pinwheel They are:Êùé‰∏ûË≤¨:Êñ∞Êò•ÂêâÁ••ÈñãÈÅãÊ≥ï, Êù±ÈÄ±Âàä, http://eastweek.my- magazine.me/index.php?aid=10494, Retrieved from 3/4/2014 # Preparing of the offerings, they may include: incense sticks, red candles, fresh fruits, flowers, meats and any other Chinese New Year food. # Hitting the ‚ÄòDrum of heaven‚Äô (Â§©Èºì) to inform Che Kung the worshiper has come. # Placing the offerings in front of the statue of Che Kung, and then lighting up the candles and burning the incense sticks. # Telling Che Kung personal information and wishes while offering the incense in the main hall. # Burning the paper clothes, paper money and other paper offerings to Che Kung in the assigned area. # Spinning the golden pinwheel with the left hand outside the temple clockwise if to continue good luck from last year into the coming year; otherwise, to change bad luck last year into good luck for in the coming year, the pinwheel is spun counterclockwise. # Buying a personal pinwheel and placing it in a position that abides by the principles of Feng Shui. # Returning to the temple and giving offerings to Che Kung to thank him for his care in the prior year. Apart from the ceremony carried in the above hall, there are other practices to be done in the subordinate halls e.g. Tai Sui (Â§™Ê≠≤), Cai Shen (Ë≤°Á•û). For believers who are students, they often write down their name and wishes on a praying paper, and stick it onto a board called Jinbang timing board (ÈáëÊ¶úÈ°åÂêçÊùø) to pray for better academic achievements. To express their respect to Che Kung, believers may donate to the temple (Ê∑ªÈ¶ôÊ≤π). Divination (Ê±ÇÁ±§) is also practised in Che Kung Temple as a way of fortune- telling. =Popularity and its believers= On the Che Kung festival in 2014, 65 thousand people went to Che Kung.Ëµ§Âè£ÊãúËªäÂÖ¨ ‰∫∫Êï∏Â§ßË∑å6Êàê(n.d. 2014) http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20140202/52149732 Believers think practising divination in Che Kung temple has made accurate predictions in the past. The first time was in 2003, Minister of Home Affairs Dr Patrick Ho Chi- ping on behalf of the city pulled out the worst possible bamboo stick in the temple on the Birthday of Che Kung. In the same year, Hong Kong was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.A.Wu(2013).It's time for Hong Kong to make its own luck,SCMA, http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight- opinion/article/1152450/its-time-hong-kong-make-its-own-luck Therefore, the person on behalf of Hong Kong practising divination on the Birthday of Che Kung has changed to Lau Wong Fat, the minister of Heung Yee Kuk since 2004. The Birthday of Che Kung also relates to some political controversy. In the event of Hong Kong Express Rail Link controversy, about 20 post-80s generation anti-rail representatives joined the Hong Kong Government Lunar New year kau cim tradition at Che Kung temple, Sha Tin to draw three divination sticks as a way of demonstration to express their anger towards Hong Kong government.80ÂæåÁÇ∫Á§æÂçÄÂÆ∂ÂúíÊ±ÇÂæó‰∏ãÁ±§(n.d 2010), The Sun, http://the- sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20100216/00407_007.html =Ritual meanings= Purpose of the ceremony and date selection Pinwheels Che Kung is famous for his power to suppress chaos and his supreme ability to cure diseases. Precisely because of the abilities of Che Kung, he was soon revered as a \\"God\\" and has been considered as a \\"God of protection\\". Consequently, his followers and worshipers constructed a temple specifically for Che Kung in order to praise his power and good deeds. Moreover, there are four festival seasons of Che Kung‚Äôs birthday in Lunar Calendar (including 2/1, 27/3, 6/6 and 16/8). Since the first festival season falls on the Lunar New Year holiday, believers have dedicated the third day of the Lunar New Year as an annual event to worship Che Kung, and the celebration is known as \\"The Birthday of Che Kung\\" nowadays. Meanings behind the objects used Devotees choose to burn incense sticks. Burning incense sticks is a common phenomenon during the festival, because the process of burning incense sticks and the rising smoke symbolizes the appreciation of the devotees to the blessing and protection from Che Kung of the previous year. Devotees would also tell their living problems to Che Kung and hope that he will fulfill their wish. It is believed that their wishes will be carried up to heaven to Che Kung by the smoke of the incense. Pinwheels can always be found next to the effigy of Che Kung, and they are regarded as ‚Äòa wheel of fortune‚Äô. It is believed that the one who turns the pinwheel will be granted with prosperity and good luck for the entire year. =Reflection of Chinese cultures/values= In Chinese culture, worshiping Che Kung is similar to worshiping Guandi,Superscribing Symbols: The Myth of Guandi, Chinese God of War, Duara.P(1988), JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/2057852 a god widely worshiped within Chinese communities as they believe he protects the entire nation. Both of them were generals protecting their country and demonstrated the loyalty to the motherland and to the people. Hong Kong local residents believe that Che Kung would protect them and their villages as he protected the Song dynasty. Being deeply influenced by Confucianism, Chinese people admire the bravery and uprightness of Che Kung. On the 3rd of First Month in Lunar Month, traditionally, Chinese people think it is easy to have an argument with other people and this will give them misfortune. To prevent this curse from happening, Chinese people would like to worship folk god(s). That is the reason why so many people choose this day to go to worship Che Kung and pray for their fortune in the following year.

He has played a wide variety of music, loosely fitting into several other genres such as hardcore punk, math rock, post-rock, electronica, folk rock and indie pop. Though a multi-instrumentalist (including guitar, bass guitar, banjo and drums), he is best known for his guitar work. Career A native of Louisville, Kentucky, Pajo played with three Louisville hardcore and hardcore- inflected bands in his early career. The first band in which he played was called Obscene Routine, after which he performed as guitarist in Maurice, but it was with Solution Unknown that he made his first recording. He rose to prominence, however, for his work with the influential post-rock band Slint. Since the breakup of Slint, Pajo has seldom held positions in other bands for very long, moving from one to the other quite often. As a result, he has contributed to many line-ups, playing and recording with Will Oldham, The For Carnation, Tortoise, Stereolab, Royal Trux, King Kong, Bush League, Zwan, Peggy Honeywell, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and, most recently, Interpol. He has also performed and released music as a solo artist using various monikers, as Aerial M,\\"Live Reviews: Aerial M / Sam Prekop April 1, 1999 The Horseshoe, Toronto, ON\\". Chart Attack, review by Vanessa Lewis M, and most notably, Papa M. Among his 7\\" and splits with various bands, he has released (as Aerial M) 1997's Aerial M, and (as Papa M) 1999's Live from a Shark Cage, 2001's Whatever, Mortal, and 2003's Hole of Burning Alms. In February and March 2005 he joined his old bandmates from Slint, Britt Walford, Brian McMahan and Todd Brashear for a reunion tour, and in April released his first solo album not bearing a pseudonym, simply entitled Pajo. The follow-up to Pajo, entitled 1968, was released in August 2006. Around the middle of 2005, he helped to form the band Dead Child, with Todd Cook (from Shipping News, Retsin, The For Carnation, and Aerial M‚Äîand who also played guitar on the 2005 Slint reunion tour), Michael McMahan (from The For Carnation, Starkiller, and Phantom Family Halo‚Äîand who also joined Slint on the reunion tour), and Tony Bailey (from Anomoanon, The Party Girls, Verktum, Lords, and Aerial M). In 2009, Pajo joined the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on the tour for their third album, It's Blitz! He was confirmed to perform as Papa M at the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010. In June 2010 it was announced that he would be joining the band Interpol as a tour member.Breihan, Tom (2010) \\"Interpol Set LP Title, Enlist Dave Pajo\\", Pitchfork Media, June 4, 2010, retrieved 2010-06-06 He left the tour early on February 27, 2011. On February 12, 2015, Pajo attempted suicide after posting a lengthy suicide note on his personal blog. He survived this attempt after EMS members were able to rescue him. On May 1st, 2020, it was revealed that David Pajo was a member of a recording project/band called Household Gods that also consisted of Vern Rumsey of Unwound, Conan Neutron of Conan Neutron & the Secret Friends and Replicator and Lauren K. Newman (LKN) of Palo Verde and LKN Band. The record, Palace Intrigue was recorded at Rancho De La Luna studio in Joshua Tree, CA.

It is located on Danforth Avenue, between Chester Avenue and Dewhurst Boulevard, in east Toronto. Named after Asa Danforth, Jr., an American contractor who designed Queen Street and Kingston Road, the area is known for its architecture dating back to as early as 1910, and for its number of Greek restaurants and stores. The area was one of the major settlement areas of Greek immigrants to Toronto after World War I. History Prior to World War II, Toronto's nascent Greek population of about 3,000 was concentrated in the area bounded by Yonge Street, Carlton Street, Church Street and what is now Dundas Street East. It was this area that was the focus of the 1918 Toronto anti-Greek riot. In the 1950s, the Danforth saw an influx of Italian immigrants followed by Greek immigrants in the 1960s - many of whom were fleeing political and economic unrest which culminated in the seizure of power by the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì74. In the 1970s and 1980s the Danforth was regarded as the largest Greektown in North America. The Danforth has recently experienced a wave of gentrification. In 1993, the BIA Board of Management's lobbying of City Hall paid off, and the BIA was officially renamed \\"GreekTown on the Danforth\\". More recently, the area has experienced a wave of gentrification as higher-priced restaurants and bars have moved in, as well as a European-style public square (at Logan Avenue). Greektown on the Danforth boasts one of the highest concentrations of restaurants per kilometre in the world. The neighbourhood is mentioned in the Barenaked Ladies song, The Old Apartment, and by critically acclaimed author Joseph Assenza in his novel, \\"The History of John.\\" Several scenes in the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding were shot here, mentioned on free walking tours of the neighbourhood. Some parts of Greektown are still dominated by Canadians of Greek descent (Greek-Canadians). Greeks constitute the most populous ethnic group in the Toronto‚ÄîDanforth ward located in Greektown, at 7.3% of the total 100,000 population). On July 22, 2018, there was a mass shooting in Greektown that killed two and injured 13. Taste of the Danforth The Taste of the Danforth is an annual festival held in Greektown, celebrating Greek cuisine and culture. The annual Taste of the Danforth is a large food festival held over 2¬Ω days in mid-August. With no admission charge, the event welcomes all to enjoy modestly priced samples of cuisine available at restaurants along the stretch of Danforth Avenue from Broadview to Jones Avenues. Greek food prevails, but there are numerous options, including Thai, Chinese, Brazilian, Indian, Japanese and others. A midway offers games, children's rides, and interactive sports that include a climbing wall, street hockey and basketball. Several stages offer musical entertainment spanning the globe, with one stage emphasizing Greek performers of music, song, and dance. The event has grown substantially since the first Taste, in 1994, when 5,000 attended. In 2008, it drew over a million people, moving to 1.5 million by 2015.

It has over 400,000 members, made up of active and retired academic and academic-related staff (including senior administrative staff) mostly from those universities established prior to 1992 (staff in the post-1992 universities are mostly members of the Teachers Pension Scheme). In 2006, it was the second largest private pension scheme in the UK by fund size. The headquarters of Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (USS) are in Liverpool. History =The Federated Superannuation Scheme for Universities, 1913-1974= In 1911 the President of the Board of Education established an Advisory Committee on University Grants. This research formed the basis of the predecessor of USS, the Federated Superannuation System for Universities, which was approved by the Board of Education and membership became compulsory for new appointees post 1 October 1913. The basic plan criteria were: *The benefit was an annuity or cash payment through an insurance policy maturing at age 60. *Optionally, benefits were available for dependants on death in service. *The policy was held in trust by the member‚Äôs institution and was transferable to a new institution if required or to an individual on leaving the University service. *Members contributed 5% of salary and the employer matched this until 1920 when the employer contribution was increased to 10%. *Administrative staff on salaries comparable to academic staff were also eligible to join. However, perceived drawbacks of the scheme were that it did not link to final pay, access was contingent on a medical examination, there was no guarantee for dependents, little provision for risk benefits, and no indexation of benefits. Hence it compared unfavourably to the defined benefit scheme already enjoyed by school teachers under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. From 1958 to 1969 several committees were established to review the present arrangements. The recommendations for a defined benefit scheme were initially rejected by universities in 1960 and again by a committee in 1964, who concluded it was ‚Äúunable to make a clear recommendation in favour of either system‚Äù.Douglas Logan, The Birth of a Pension Scheme. A History of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (Liverpool University Press 1985). =Universities Superannuation Scheme, 1974‚Äì2011= In 1969, a Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) for the reform of FSSU was established, and commissioned a report from G. Heywood (the FSSU Consulting Actuary) that included a proposed outline for USS. It was to be a one-eightieth scheme with a three times annuity lump sum, available to new entrants only. No medical examination was required and pensions would not be increased. A meeting to discuss the structure of USS took place in Liverpool on the 28 December 1970. The proposal for an independent company was approved by the JCC in November 1971, and endorsed by the CVCP in December 1971. The FSSU Executive Committee was ‚Äúunenthusiastic‚Äù. Drafting of the rules began in 1971, with the seventh draft being agreed in August 1973 and circulated to universities along with an explanatory booklet. The scheme was finally introduced on 1 April 1975. The scheme was a 'balance of cost' scheme in which the sponsors bear the risk of default, and specifically a 'last-man-standing multi-employer scheme', meaning that if an employer collapsed, the others would bear its responsibilities to its pensioners, such that 'default would require the bankruptcy of every institution, that is, the collapse of the UK university and research community'. Combined with extensive state funding of the higher education sector, this has been thought to make the risk of default very low.Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Asset‚ÄìLiability Modelling and Pension Schemes: The Application of Robust Optimization to USS', The European Journal of Finance (2015), 1-29, doi:10.1080/1351847X.2015.1071714. At the scheme's inception, contributions were 16% of salary, with employers paying 10%, and members paying 6% plus a 2% surcharge aimed at covering benefits for service prior to the scheme's inception. From 1983 to 1997, the employers' contribution rate increased to 18.55%. From January 1997 to September 2009 it decreased to 14%, and employee contribution reduced to 6.35%.Susan Cooper, 'A Pensions Proposal: Constant Contributions' (p. 1).John Board and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Joined‚ÄêUp Pensions Policy in the UK: An Asset‚ÄêLiability Model for Simultaneously Determining the Asset Allocation and Contribution Rate', JEL, 40 (Autumn 2007), 87-118 (p. 102) (first published in Handbook of Asset and Liability Management, edited by Stavros A. Zenios and William T. Ziemba, (North Holland Handbooks in Finance, Elsevier Science B.V., Volume 2, 2007, pp. 1029‚Äê67 ). The employer contribution was increased to 16% in October 2009. The defined benefit of the scheme was to consist of a one-time cash lump sum of 3/80 of the final salary and an annual income of 1/80 of retiree's final salary, both multiplied by years of contributions. For purposes of calculation, the final salary was revalued each year in line with inflation. From its inception, USS was the main pension scheme for UK academics and senior administrative staff of universities and similar higher-education or research institutions. This predominance was lessened, however, when the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 created numerous 'new universities', whose employees (old and new) remained in the state-run Teachers' Pension Scheme.'What will the end of final-salary pensions mean for academics?', Times Higher Education (12 March 2015), URL. From 10 December 1999, any employee of a UK higher education institution became eligible to join USS if they wished. By 2014, USS had become the UK's second-largest pension scheme, with 316,440 active members, deferred pensioners and pensioners. It was, by this measure, the world's 36th-largest. 374-79 separate institutions participated in the scheme, and its assets were valued at ¬£42 billion.Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Scheme Redesign and Wealth Redistribution Between the Members and Sponsor: The USS Rule Change in October 2011', Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 69 (2016), 14‚Äì28. In 2017 it had 190,546 active members. = Changes of 2011 = Few changes to USS's rules were made until October 2011, when dramatic changes were implemented,Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Schemes, Taxation and Stakeholder Wealth: The USS Rule Changes', ICMA Centre, Discussion Paper Number: ICM-2017-08 (23 January 2018): https://ssrn.com/abstract=3039364; partly in response to losses resulting from the Great Recession, and consequent increased projected scheme deficit: * USS closed its final salary scheme to new members, replacing it with a career average revalued earnings (CARE) scheme for new members. * The retirement age was linked to the UK state retirement age. * Contribution rates for members still in the final salary section rose from 6.35% to 7.5%. * The scheme changed from being 'balance-of-cost' (in which sponsors are ultimately responsible for meeting promised pensions) to a 'cap-and-share' rule, in which extra contributions would, if necessary, be met 35% by members and 65% by sponsors. * The indexation of deferred pensions and pensions in payment was changed from the retail price index to the less generous consumer price index, and uprating of accrued benefits was capped.'USS to adopt CPI inflation measure', The Financial Times (23 January 2011). The changes were the subject of 'heated public controversy' between USS's institutional sponsors and the scheme's members, represented by the University and College Union, and involved lengthy industrial action. Researchers did find, however, that 'the pre-October 2011 scheme was not viable in the long run', whereas the post- October 2011 scheme was 'probably viable in the long run', though it faced medium-term problems as the effects of the changes on the state of the fund would take time to be felt. Subsequent research found that reductions in payout reduced the effective value of making (pre-tax contributions) to USS pension versus having to make after-tax contributions to a private savings by ¬£2.86 billion (¬£1.86 billion attributable to loss of value fore the member contribution and the rest in loss of return to members from the employer contribution) Whereas young members joining the pre-2011 scheme could expect their net wealth to increase by ¬£181,000 (¬£133,000 gross) relative to opting out of the scheme, those joining the post-2011 CARE section could expect a much smaller increase: ¬£98,000 (¬£46,000 gross). An earlier study by the same researchers concluded that the reduced wealth of post-2011 entrants was equivalent to an 11% drop in their total compensation or a 13% drop in their salaries. The researchers nonetheless found that the scheme remained attractive. =Changes of 2016= Despite the changes of 2011, with ongoing weak economic performance associated with the Great Recession, USS continued to identify deficits, leading to further negotiations, industrial action, and eventually dramatic changes being implemented in April 2016. The key changes were:Jack Grove, 'New USS Pension Reform Plans to be Put to Union Vote', Times Higher Education (15 January 2015). * The final-salary pension scheme (only available to members who joined before the 2011 changes) was closed. Benefits previously accrued were protected, but were frozen at a level relating to an employee‚Äôs salary as of March 2016 (uprated annually by inflation). * All active members thereafter switched to the CARE scheme, with benefits being based on career-average earnings. * Employee contributions rose to 8%, and employer contributions from 16% to 18% of salary. *Defined benefits could now only be earned on the first ¬£55,000 of a salary. For salary over ¬£55,000, employers paid only 12% (rather than 18%) of salary into this defined contribution scheme (6% being diverted from higher earner's pension toward paying down the scheme deficit). Staff had the option of making an additional 1% payment which would be matched by the employer. *Defined benefit accrual was raised from one eightieth to one seventy-fifth of pensionable salary. =2018 Proposed changes= By 2017, the scheme had over 400,000 members.'Universities‚Äô main pension pot faces the biggest deficit of any British fund', The Economist (3 August 2017). The USS scheme reported a technical deficit of ¬£17.5 billion in July 2017, reported as the largest such shortfall in the UK at that time. Under diverse conventional accounting rules, the scheme has been in deficit for several years (see Figure). This varies depending on the rules used. For instance as of March 2010, the actuary estimated the scheme was 91% funded (¬£3.1 billion deficit) according to the scheme specific funding regime, 80% funded on an FRS17 basis, and 57% funded on a buy-out basis. USS pension scheme fund percent funding 2008-2017. The USS Joint Negotiating Committee therefore made the following proposals, to be introduced after 1 April 2019:'Proposed changes to future USS benefits'. * The defined benefits section of the scheme would close (with a possibility of reintroducing it). All future benefits (apart from death in service and ill health retirement benefits) would be transferred to the defined contribution (DC) scheme. * Member contributions would remain at 8%. Members would gain an option of paying in only 4% while still receiving the full employer contribution. The employer match of the first 1% of any voluntary employee savings would be lost. Members‚Äô contributions would include a contribution to finance death in service and ill-health retirement benefits. * Employer contributions would remain at 18%. Of this 13.25% would build employee DC pension pots, with the other 4.75% used for deficit recovery (plus management and running costs). UCU, whose objections to these proposals had been overruled, proceeded to ballot successfully for industrial action in an attempt to secure a more favourable settlement for members, leading to the 2018 USS pension dispute.Jane Deith, 'University staff strike over pensions', Channel 4 News (22 February 2018). = 2019 Scheme cost increases = Following the 2018 strike action, contributions from employees and employers increased substantially : Member contributions increased, initially from 8% to 8.8% of salary. Then from 1 October 2019, to 9.6%. Subject to review, this is planned to increase to 11% from 1 October 2021. Corresponding employer contributions increased from 18% to 19.5%, then (from 1 October) to 21.1%, with a planned increase to 23.7% planned for 2021. For members earning over the salary cap (~¬£58,000), employer contribution dropped to 12% for earnings above this threshold, with the difference (about 9% of salary) being used to pay down the overall scheme deficit.  2019 exit by Trinity College, Cambridge  On 15 March 2019, in a move that came to be dubbed 'Trexit' (an allusion to Brexit), the Council of Trinity College, Cambridge voted to withdraw the college unilaterally from USS as of 31 May 2019, replacing the USS scheme with a defined benefits scheme, to avoid the college bearing any responsibility for other pensions in the UK higher education system in the event of foreclosures in the sector. USS noted that this development would not in itself significantly affect the strength of the scheme, but that if a further financially secure employer left the scheme, the scheme would be markedly weaker. The move prompted some Cambridge academics to begin boycotting supervising Trinity College students,Noella Chye, 'Revealed: Trinity plans exit from national pension scheme, isolating college from higher education sector', Varsity (8 December 2018).Noella Chye, 'Leaked: Trinity has voted to leave the UK pensions scheme.

Cambridge University's graduate student union supported the boycott, discouraging postgraduate students from taking up teaching for Trinity.Ellie Arden and Dylan Perera, 'Trexit conflicts continue as Trinity welcomes new master', Varsity (8 October 2019). The General Secretary elect of UCU, Jo Grady, published an open letter calling on the college's fellows to change their course, arguing that to do so was in their interest and the interest of the USS pension scheme generally.Rosie Bradbury, 'Cambridge academics rally outside Trinity in protest of USS exit', Varsity (30 May 2019).Jo Grady, 'Open letter to Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge' (29 May 2019). On 21 June, however, Trinity's fellows voted by 73 votes to 46 to leave USS, prompting UCU to consider its second ever national boycott of a UK HE institution.Natalie Tuck, 'UCU threatens boycott of Trinity College over USS exit', PensionsAge (21 June 2019).\\"Union censures Cambridge's Trinity College in row over pension scheme\\" (21 June 2019). In October 2019, as the 2019-20 academic year began, several fellows of Trinity resigned.Camilla Turner, \\"Cambridge college faces resignations over decision to switch pension plans for staff\\", The Telegraph (3 October 2019), p. 11. With the number of staff boycotting Trinity reported as standing at 550, Trinity students began to report difficulty finding supervisors, and protests were staged at the inauguration of Trinity's new master, Sally Davies. The University and College Union was reported at this time as preparing a national boycott of Trinity College.Ellie Arden and Dylan Perera, 'Trexit conflicts continue as Trinity welcomes new master', Varsity (8 October 2019). In February 2020, Arundhati Roy had agreed to give Trinity College's annual Clark Lecture in English literature, but withdrew at the request of Cambridge UCU because of the boycott.Anna Vassiliades, 'Trinity College‚Äôs 2020 Clark Lecturer pulls out in solidarity with the academic boycott', The Cambridge Tab (4 February 2020).Kenneth Yarhamby Beatriz Valero de Urquia, 'Ongoing academic boycott of Trinity College sees Clark Lecture cancelled', Varsity (14 February 2020). She did, however, supply her lecture to Trinity in written form, and it appeared on the college's website.Arundhati Roy, 'The Graveyard Talks Back: Fiction in the Time of Fake News' (accessed 21 February 2020).'Arundhati Roy's Clark Lecture 2020' (accessed 21 February 2020).  Management and Investments  The scheme publishes detailed annual reports, available online. Returns on the portfolio over 5 years to 31 March 2019 were an annualised 10.09% per yr. Through the 1990s and into 2020, the fund's main asset classes were UK, European and US equities; US and UK bonds; UK property; and cash. USS's liabilities are all in sterling and, from April 2006, USS began hedging all foreign exchange risk (having previously hedged none). In 2019, the largest asset classes were Listed Shares (40.92%), Other private markets (21%), Index-linked bonds (19.84%) with smaller holdings in fixed income (8.55%), property (5.51%), government bonds (4.85%) and cash (4.49%). The fund is underweight US equities. A decade earlier (2011), the distributions were: 60% equities (UK 23.06%, EU 18.32%, US 18.32%), cash (5%), 10-year UK government bonds (12.3%), UK property (7%), hedge funds (8%), and commodities (8%). Commercial assets have included Telford Shopping Centre in Telford, Shropshire (sold to Hark Group and Apollo Real Estate), and the Grand Arcade development in Cambridge and Forestside Shopping Centre, Belfast.

The scheme came under renewed pressure from 2015, via the 'USS: Step Up' campaign, which had noted investments in tobacco and fossil fuels. As of 2019, USS offers four ethical investment options. Around 8% of members had taken advantage of these. In 2017, it was reported that the USS pension scheme has offshore investments in tax havens. In 2014, USS's highest- paid executive, received a 50% pay increase, to ¬£900,000 and criticism of the high pay of top USS employees grew.

It has staff offices located throughout the United States and abroad. History FCA was founded in 1954 by Eastern Oklahoma A&M; basketball coach Don McClanen, who later resigned to become its full-time director. After watching sports stars use fame to endorse and sell general merchandise, McClanen wrote to 19 prominent sports figures asking for their help in establishing an organization that would use the same principle to share the Christian faith. Among the first supporters were Baseball Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, who was most known for breaking the MLB color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945, and professional athletes including Otto Graham, Carl Erskine and Don Moomaw.http://archives.fca.org/vsItemDisplay.lsp&objectID;=C658F118-CB82-4DA8-A0CBD628E9B07F9C&method;=display FCA held its first advisory board meeting in September 1954 and was officially incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in November. After two years in Oklahoma, McClanen moved FCA's headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri. That year (1956), FCA also conducted its first national camp‚Äö then referred to as a national conference‚Äö which drew 256 athletes and coaches to Estes Park, Colo. The ministry continued its expansion by adding additional camp locations, establishing a national magazine and beginning school campus groups called ‚Äö\\"Huddles‚Äö\\" within 10 years of the first camp. In 1979 FCA completed and dedicated a new headquarters facility overlooking Kansas City‚Äö Truman Sports Complex, and the building was officially renamed the FCA National Support Center in 2011. Statement of Faith The Fellowship of Christian Athletes operates according to an internally written statement of faith. This statement consists of nine points based on Bible teachings and Christian principles. Each point has a corresponding scripture. All staff and ministry leaders agree with and operate according to the FCA statement of faith. Core values The Fellowship of Christian Athletes lists four core values for its ministry: Integrity, Serving, Teamwork and Excellence. Each core value has a corresponding scripture. Leadership While all students are welcome to attend FCA Huddles, students in leadership are required to sign a Statement of Faith and a Sexual Purity Statement. Criticism In September 2015, Roanoke City and Roanoke County, Virginia public schools ended FCA ministry to football players following at least two complaints. In an FCA activity referred to as the \\"Watermelon Ministry\\", the organization had visited public high school student athletes at team practices to offer watermelon slices and tell players that all the talents they have come from God. Two FCA videos from August 2015 of the now-halted program show public school coaches standing behind their team while an FCA evangelist sternly warns them that to be good players they must have a Christian faith and read the Bible. In a third video, numerous Virginia public high school coaches speak about how the FCA helps them recruit students to Christianity. One coach, for example, states: \\"We teach them not only about sports and how to live your life, but how to live your life as a Christian. I think that‚Äôs really important, for us to just have a chance to relate with all different kinds of kids, not just the ones who go to church, but maybe the ones who don‚Äôt go to church. It allows us to draw them in in a relaxed environment and really speak to them about the Gospel, which is the reason we do what we do. We want to bring kids to the gospel and see them follow after Christ.\\" The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national nonprofit organization, referred to the activities as \\"predatory,\\" \\"illegal\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\" in letters sent to superintendents of two of the largest Virginia jurisdictions involved. School officials responded they were unaware that the coaches were hosting the proselytizing, and immediately stopped it. The Roanoke County superintendent stated ‚ÄúRoanoke County Schools believes in the separation of church and state. We want to maintain and ensure that that practice is being followed.‚Äù A city of Roanoke spokesman said ‚ÄúWhen this information came to our attention, we responded immediately. We met with the appropriate people and made it very clear that separation of church and state is the law of the land. We feel the matter is under control and we will monitor this very closely.‚Äù Through its media office, FCA issued the following response, \\"Every student athlete has the right and the freedom to participate in activities according to their individual religious convictions. There are no repercussions for students who decline to participate in FCA activities.\\" The FFRF letters, however had noted that repercussions may take the form of pressure from peers and coaches, alienating non-Christian students, and usurping parents' authority. The FCA sexual purity statement has been criticized because it includes statements against homosexuality, which must be signed by FCA representatives of the ministry including staff, trustees and adult volunteer ministry leaders. Student leaders sign a Student Leader Application when serving in leadership roles within the organization, but this application does not require signing the sexual purity statement. Professional athletes Since 1954, professional athletes and coaches have taken part in FCA through ministry events, speaking engagements, FCA camps, volunteer opportunities and ministry leadership roles. For approximately six decades, athletes and coaches from both major and minor professional sports and top-tier college programs have engaged with FCA to communicate their Christian faith and participate in community outreach opportunities. Among those who pioneered the organization were former stars Otto Graham, Branch Rickey, Bobby Richards, Carl Erskine and Bill Krisher. They would be followed by other influential sports figures including Bobby Bowden, Jim Ryun, Betsy King, Herschel Walker, Reggie White, Tony Dungy, Shaun Alexander, Tom Osborne and Shanna Zolman, all of whom vocalized their Christian faith through FCA outlets such as banquets, camps and rallies. Recent stars who have connected with FCA have included Adam Wainwright, Brian Roberts, Tim Tebow, Tamika Catchings, John Harbaugh, Leah O'Brien Amico, Allyson Felix http://entertainment.accessatlanta.com/cartersville_ga/events/show/304097685-fca- banquet-guest-speaker-john-smoltz Colt McCoy, Andrew McCutchen and a number of public figures outside the world of sports such as comedian Jeff Foxworthy, and Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson. FCA award winners FCA presents six national awards every year to athletes and coaches who have excelled in specific areas of competition, community service and Christian character. * Bobby Bowden Athlete of the Year: Named after former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden, this award is presented annually to a Division I FBS football player who conducts himself as a faith model in the community, in the classroom and on the field. Nominees must have 3.0 GPA or better and must have the backing of his school‚Äö athletic director and head football coach. Winners have included Clemson wide receiver Hunter Renfrow (2018), Oklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph (2017), Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson (2016), Oklahoma center Ty Darlington (2015), Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty (2014), Texas A&M;'s offensive lineman Jake Matthews (2013), Auburn linebacker Ashton Richardson (2012) and quarterbacks Case Keenum (2011), Christian Ponder (2010) and Colt McCoy (2009). * Grant Teaff Coach of the Year: The Grant Teaff Coach of the Year Award is named after former Baylor University football coach Grant Teaff, who also served as the executive director of the American Football Coaches Association and member of the FCA National Board of Trustees.

This is a form of calico, called a Sakura. The ryukin is a hardy and attractive variety of goldfish with a pointed head and has a pronounced hump on the back behind the head. It may be long-finned or short-finned with either a triple or quadruple tail. The dorsal fin is high while the caudal fin is often twice as long as the body. The caudal fin may also have three or four lobes. Ryukins come in deep-red, red-and-white, white, silver, blue, black, orange, lavender grey, iron and calico coloration. The ryukin is a fine aquarium fish that can reach up to 8 inches (21 centimeters) in length. Some ryukins are reported to grow up to 10 inches in large aquariums and commercial ponds. History and origins The Ryukin is Chinese in origin. It is unknown when the ryukin was bred but it is thought to come from the Wakin.About the Ryukin, retrieved on: 24 Aug 2018 It has been so named because it was said to have arrived in Japan through the Ryukyu Islands, now Okinawa Prefecture, which lies between Taiwan and Japan. There were historical references that the existence of ryukins dates back to 1833, but it is said to have arrived in Japan in the 1770s. Early Japanese literature refers to the ryukin as the onaga (longtail) or the nagasaki goldfish. In English texts, they are also referred to as the Japanese ribbontail, the fringetail, the fantail or the veiltail.

The Camelina species, commonly known as false flax, are native to Mediterranean regions of Europe and Asia. Most species of this genus have been little studied, with the exception of Camelina sativa, historically cultivated as an oil plant. Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz was the first botanist to use the genus Camelina in his classification works in 1762. As a way to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the US Navy tested a 50-50 mix of jet aviation fuel and biofuel derived from camelina seeds in 2010. A study published in December 2016 explained that the current low price of conventional kerosene-based jet fuel makes it cost-prohibitive for commercial airlines to use camelina-based jet fuel. The study said substantial government intervention would be one way to create a market for camelina, by combining 9 percent government subsidy on camelina crop production, with 9 percent tax on the conventional fuel. Etymology The name Camelina comes from the Greek for \\"ground\\" and \\"flax\\", alluding to its being a weed which suppresses the vigour of flax crops. Description Camelina plants are annual or biennial herbs. Their leaves are simple, lanceolate to narrowly elliptic. The flowers are hermaphroditic actinomorphic, grouped in racemes, and yellowish colored. The seeds are formed in dehiscent siliques. Genetics The first full genome sequence for Camelina sativa was released on August 1, 2013, by a Canadian research team. The genome sequence and its annotation are available in a genome viewer format and enabled for sequence searching and alignment. Technical details of Camelina's genome sequence were published on April 23, 2014 in the academic journal Nature Communications. Rothamsted Institute in the UK developed genetically modified Camelina sativa plants that accumulate in their seeds high levels of the longer chain omega-3 oils EPA and DHA, commonly found in fish oils. These plants could provide terrestrial sustainable sources of longer chain omega-3 fatty acids and have benefits for human health and the environment. Field trials were underway in 2016. Species Four common species are presented below. However, at least two databanks indicate more species may exist. *Camelina alyssum *Camelina microcarpa *Camelina rumelica *Camelina sativa  Biodiesel Biodiesel made from camelina has a variety of benefits. First, traditional petroleum or diesel fuel is not renewable resources, the production of these resources is finite. Camelina biodiesel, however, is a renewable resource. Camelina based aviation fuel could save 84% of carbon emissions. Camelina biodiesel can be produced in large quantities as feedstocks are enough. Moreover, camelina biodiesel can reduce the country's dependence on fossil resources, which can ensure the country's energy security. In addition, camelina biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel, and it is biodegradable. Besides, the development of the camelina biodiesel industry can bring employment opportunities. The government has given the industry strong support since camelina biodiesel has a variety of benefits. Therefore, camelina biodiesel has policy support. What‚Äôs more, the development of the camelina biodiesel industry has brought great economic benefits. According to the investigation, the greenhouse gas emission of camelina biodiesel produced under no-tillage method is lower than that of traditional methods.

Biography  Born in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, the son of Henry Barlow Brown and Rebecca Appleton, as a young man he moved to Montreal, Lower Canada. Once there, he found work and with his savings eventually went into the hardware business. His operation encountered financial difficulties and closed leaving Brown to find other employment. A member of the Unitarian Church, Thomas Brown was an advocate for both social and political reform, supporting the concept of responsible government in which the members of the Legislative Council of Quebec would be appointed by the Legislative Assembly's majority party. Brown also worked to improve social conditions through aid to the poor. Influenced by the republic form of government in the United States, over time his frustrations with the government of Great Britain saw him join the Montreal Vindicator newspaper in 1832 at the invitation of his friend Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan. Following the death of founder Daniel Tracey, O'Callaghan had been appointed the paper's new editor and with Brown, they continued to espouse the former owner's radical views. Their attacks were especially harsh against the Governor of the Colony, Lord Gosford despite the fact that he had ordered the dissolution of the British Rifle Corps in January 1836. In 1833, Brown's wife, Jane Hughes, died. By this time, Brown had moved firmly from a moderate who sought to reform the political system, to a radical wanting to fundamentally alter Canadian society. In 1837 he participated in the Lower Canada Rebellion and was head of the military faction of the rebel group, the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√©, that openly advocating revolution. In November, Brown was wounded and partially blinded in one eye during the street fight between the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√© and the Doric Club but nevertheless, in December he still fought against the British Army at the Battle of Saint-Charles. Defeated, he escaped to the United States where he worked as a journalist in Florida. In 1844, he was granted an amnesty and returned to Montr√©al where Charles Wilson gave him a job in his hardware store. Brown married Hester Livingston in 1860 and a little more than a year later was given administrative posts in the government. Thomas Storrow Brown died at his home in Montreal in 1888 at the age of eighty-five.

The Hambros bank was a specialist in Anglo-Scandinavian business with expertise in trade finance and investment banking, and was the sole banker to the Scandinavian kingdoms for many years. The Bank was sold in 1998, and today survives only in the name of the private banking division of the French group Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. History =Early history= Hambros was founded by the Danish merchant and banker Carl Joachim Hambro in London in 1839 as C. J. Hambro & Son. During the 1850s he was responsible for arranging various British Government loan stock issues enabling the bank to prosper. =Pre-war and Second World War= After merging with the British Bank of Northern Commerce (owned by Enskilda Banken and a number of Scandinavian savings banks) in 1921 the name was changed to Hambros Bank, and the firm expanded. As a result, in 1926 a bigger head office was constructed at 41 Bishopsgate, where the bank remained until 1988. The 1930 depression affected the bank's international business and it concentrated on domestic lending and Scandinavia. During World War II, Sir Charles Hambro raised finance for the Norwegian exiled government and was also the head of the Special Operations Executive. =Post-war development= After the Second World War, Hambros became also known as the 'diamond bank' with its thriving activity in financing the diamond industry and its trade.Roberts, p. 213 Hambros was one of the top three banks in the Euromarket by the mid-1960s. In 1967 the private banking and trust operations were expanded offshore and new offices were opened in Jersey and Guernsey to take advantage of the offshore tax benefits. The 1970s marked Hambros' expansion into new areas of financial services - in particular, asset management, investment management for third parties, investment funds and insurance. An offshore private banking and trust operation was established in 1981 in Gibraltar to complement the offices in London, Jersey and Guernsey.Johns, p. 245 =Shipping crises and Hilmar Reksten= In the mid-1970s the bank was badly hit by the shipping crisis and repeatedly hindered by its relationship with the Norwegian shipping magnate Hilmar Reksten. Under the direction of Charles Perrin, who started his career in the bank as Assistant Company Secretary, the bank defended itself against litigation from his Trustees in Bankruptcy and the Norwegian Government on and off for nearly 25 years, including two substantial out of court settlements. =Hambro family break up= In 1986, the Hambro Trust, the majority shareholder in the bank, was dissolved and the family went their separate ways. Lord Hambro (with his children Clare, Charles and Alex) stayed with the bank and Jocelyn Hambro (with his children Rupert, Richard and James) set up J O Hambro and Sons; Jocelyn Hambro and his sons were reported to be successful in their new businesses. This resulted in substantially less Hambro family influence in the banking group and, in July 1997, in the promotion of Chips Keswick to Chairman of the Bank and Charles Perrin (of Reksten fame) to Vice Chairman and later CEO. =Sale to Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale= The former Hambros head office at 41 Tower Hill (on the right in the photograph) By the end of the decade Hambros had 1,400 staff, 900 of whom were based at 41 Tower Hill in London. In February 1998 the Hambros PLC board recommended a sale of Hambros Bank Ltd to the French bank Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, which the majority of the shareholders accepted. Chips Keswick was the prime promoter of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale takeover together with his Vice Chairman Charles Perrin, who was the last CEO of Hambros Bank Ltd. =Formation of boutiques and spin-offs= Several boutiques and spin-offs originated from or arose out of the ashes of Hambros Banking Group in the late 1990s. These included JO Hambro and Sons (Jocelyn Hambro and his sons), Hambro Magan Corporate Finance (JO Hambro and Mr Magan), J O Hambro Capital Management (James Hambro), JO Hambro Investment Management (Rupert, Richard and James Hambro), Rupert Hambro & Partners, Firecrest Hambro (Charles Edward Hambro Jr), EC Hambro Rabben & Partners (Clare Hambro and Eivind Rabben), Duke Street Capital (Edmund Truell, ex Hambro European Ventures CEO) and STAR Capital Partners (Tony Mallin, ex Vice Chairman of Hambros Bank). Getty Images was formed by two former Hambros Bank Corporate Finance Directors (Mark Getty/Jonathan Klein). One of the largest companies formed by the family was Peter Hambro Mining and Gold - now renamed Petropavlovsk and listed on the stock exchange in London.Peter Hambro Mining: History =SG Hambros= Logo as SG Hambros Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale sold Hambros PLC, including its private equity and investment side, to Investec, a South African bank in May 1998. The Hambros core private banking activities, which had been retained by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, was renamed SG Hambros Bank & Trust in November 1998. In 2006, the bank was involved with a complex tax avoidance scheme with more than 400 investors, operated by Matthew Leslie Jenner of Jersey-based NT Advisors. Subsequently, the scheme was challenged and shutdown by HM Revenue and Customs leaving the investors facing a ¬£190m bill. The bank was renamed SG Hambros Bank in January 2007.

These designations are also referred to as NatureServe ranks, NatureServe statuses, or Natural Heritage ranks. While the Nature Conservancy is no longer substantially involved in the maintenance of these ranks, the name TNC ranks is still sometimes encountered for them. NatureServe ranks indicate the imperilment of species or ecological communities as natural occurrences, ignoring individuals or populations in captivity or cultivation, and also ignoring non-native occurrences established through human intervention beyond the species' natural range (as, for example, with many invasive species). NatureServe ranks have been designated primarily for species and ecological communities in the United States and Canada, but the methodology is global, and has been used in some areas of Latin America and the Caribbean. The NatureServe Explorer websiteNatureServe Explorer website presents a centralized set of global, national, and subnational NatureServe ranks developed by NatureServe or provided by cooperating U.S. Natural Heritage Programs and Canadian and other international Conservation Data Centers. Introduction Most NatureServe ranks address the conservation status of a plant or animal species or a natural ecological community using a one-to-five numerical scale (from most vulnerable to most secure), applied either globally (world-wide or range-wide) or to the entity's status within a particular nation or a specified subnational unit within a nation. Letter- based notations are used for various special cases to which the numerical scale does not apply, as explained below. Ranks at various levels may be concatenated to combine geographical levels, and also to address infraspecific taxa (subspecies and plant varieties). =Global, national, and subnational levels= NatureServe conservation statuses may be applied at any or all of three geographical levels: * G - Ranks designated at the global (or range- wide) level (G-rank), * N - Ranks designated at a national level (N-rank) for a particular nation, and * S - Ranks designated at a subnational level (S-rank) for a particular next-lower geographical unit within a nation, such as a state within the United States, Brazil, or Mexico, or a province or territory within Canada. =Commonly encountered ranks= The most commonly encountered NatureServe conservation statuses at the G-, N-, or S-level are: Numbers * 1 ‚Äî Critically imperiled ‚Äî (typically having 5 or fewer occurrences, or 1,000 or fewer individuals). * 2 ‚Äî Imperiled ‚Äî (typically having 6 to 20 occurrences, or 1,001 to 3,000 individuals). * 3 ‚Äî Vulnerable ‚Äî (rare; typically having 21 to 100 occurrences, or 3,001 to 10,000 individuals). * 4 ‚Äî Apparently secure ‚Äî (uncommon but not rare, but with some cause for long-term concern; typically having 101 or more occurrences, or 10,001 or more individuals). * 5 ‚Äî Secure ‚Äî (common, widespread, abundant, and lacking major threats or long-term concerns). Letters * X - Presumed extinct or extirpated (not located despite extensive and intensive searches, with rediscovery not reasonably expected). Note that extinction is here considered a global (range-wide) phenomenon, while extirpation applies to loss within a particular national or subnational area, with the entity still extant elsewhere. * H - Possibly extinct or extirpated (of historical occurrence but not known recently extant, with some reasonable hope of rediscovery). * R or ? - Recorded within a nation or subnation, but local status not available or not yet determined. When combined with a global rank of G1 to G3, local status is 'Indeterminate,' but the entity is nevertheless presumed vulnerable, if still extant. Thus, for example, a G3 species is \\"globally vulnerable\\", and an N2 species is \\"nationally imperiled\\" for the particular country the rank is assigned. Species with G, N, or S rankings of 4 or 5 are generally not the basis for major conservation actions. Ranks for additional cases Several less frequent special cases are addressed through other notation in the NatureServe ranking system, including: =Subspecies and plant varieties= * T - When desired, infraspecific taxa (subspecies, plant varieties, and other designations below the level of the species) may be assigned global T-ranks. A T-rank is appended to the G-rank for the including species. N-ranks and S-ranks presented with T-ranks apply to the particular infraspecific taxon, not its including species. Most taxa given such ranks have trinomial (three- word) rather than binomial (two-word) scientific names. =Non-native (exotic) taxa= * E - Used at the national or subnational levels, E indicates taxa not native in the specified area, even historically, but currently or historically present there due to direct or indirect human intervention; such taxa are often termed exotic, escaped, non-native, adventive, or waif. Note, however, that regionally native species or other taxa that have recently arrived in the area of interest by natural means (such as wind, floods, or birds), without direct or indirect human intervention, are ranked by the same methodology and notation as for other native taxa. =Interspecific hybrids= * HYB - Modern interspecific hybrids, typically encountered as isolated individuals, are rarely themselves targets of conservation attention, are generally given a placeholder global rank of HYB, and not ranked at the national or subnational levels. However, reproducing or other self-maintaining, population-forming species known or suspected to be of hybrid origin are ranked using the same methodology and notation as for other species. For example, many fertile polyploid species of ferns formed by interspecific hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. Some of these hybrid-derived species are quite rare (ranked G1), but others are so widespread, abundant, and secure as to deserve a G5 rank. =Taxa extant only in captivity or cultivation= * C - When appended to X or H, the letter 'C' indicates species or other taxa extant in captivity or cultivation, although otherwise extirpated or extinct. =Variant ranks= * #x# ‚Äì Range of ranks due to uncertainty, where x would be a repetition of the initial letter for Global, National, or Subnational rankings, e.g. G2G3 would mean a global rank ranging from G2 to G3. Limited to two ranks of difference, beyond which the status would be U for Unrankable (i.e. N1N4 would instead be listed as NU). * U ‚Äì Unrankable, due to conflicting or absent information. * NR ‚Äì Not ranked, i.e. not yet assessed. * NA ‚Äì Not applicable, meaning not suitable for conservation activities, typically used for hybrids with no conservation value, or non-native ecosystems (e.g. agricultural fields). Combinations of ranks Any NatureServe rank may be used alone, or G-, T-, N-, and S- ranks may be combined in that sequence, such as a G5N3S1 rank for a particular species (or ecological community) within a particular subnational unit of a particular nation. An entity has only a single global rank (G-rank alone, or G-rank and T-rank combination), but may have different N-ranks or S-ranks for different nations or subnations within its geographical range.

Commonly known as vanadium pentoxide, it is a brown/yellow solid, although when freshly precipitated from aqueous solution, its colour is deep orange. Because of its high oxidation state, it is both an amphoteric oxide and an oxidizing agent. From the industrial perspective, it is the most important compound of vanadium, being the principal precursor to alloys of vanadium and is a widely used industrial catalyst. The mineral form of this compound, shcherbinaite, is extremely rare, almost always found among fumaroles. A mineral trihydrate, V2O5¬∑3H2O, is also known under the name of navajoite. Chemical properties =Reduction to lower oxides= Upon heating a mixture of vanadium(V) oxide and vanadium(III) oxide, comproportionation occurs to give vanadium(IV) oxide, as a deep-blue solid: :V2O5 \\\\+ V2O3 ‚Üí 4 VO2 The reduction can also be effected by oxalic acid, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Further reduction using hydrogen or excess CO can lead to complex mixtures of oxides such as V4O7 and V5O9 before black V2O3 is reached. =Acid-base reactions= V2O5 is an amphoteric oxide. Unlike most metal oxides, it dissolves slightly in water to give a pale yellow, acidic solution. Thus V2O5 reacts with strong non-reducing acids to form solutions containing the pale yellow salts containing dioxovanadium(V) centers: :V2O5 \\\\+ 2 HNO3 ‚Üí 2 VO2(NO3) + H2O It also reacts with strong alkali to form polyoxovanadates, which have a complex structure that depends on pH.. If excess aqueous sodium hydroxide is used, the product is a colourless salt, sodium orthovanadate, Na3VO4. If acid is slowly added to a solution of Na3VO4, the colour gradually deepens through orange to red before brown hydrated V2O5 precipitates around pH 2\\\\. These solutions contain mainly the ions HVO42‚àí and V2O74‚àí between pH 9 and pH 13, but below pH 9 more exotic species such as V4O124‚àí and HV10O285‚àí (decavanadate) predominate. Upon treatment with thionyl chloride, it converts to the volatile liquid vanadium oxychloride, VOCl3: :V2O5 \\\\+ 3 SOCl2 ‚Üí 2 VOCl3 \\\\+ 3 SO2 =Other redox reactions= Hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid are oxidised to the corresponding halogen, e.g., :V2O5 \\\\+ 6HCl + 7H2O ‚Üí 2[VO(H2O)5]2+ \\\\+ 4Cl‚àí \\\\+ Cl2 Vanadates or vanadyl compounds in acid solution are reduced by zinc amalgam through the colourful pathway: none300pxthumb {{right ‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí The ions are all hydrated to varying degrees. Preparation The orange, partly hydrated form of V2O5 Precipitate of \\"red cake\\", which is hydrous V2O5 Technical grade V2O5 is produced as a black powder used for the production of vanadium metal and ferrovanadium. A vanadium ore or vanadium- rich residue is treated with sodium carbonate and an ammonium salt to produce sodium metavanadate, NaVO3. This material is then acidified to pH 2‚Äì3 using H2SO4 to yield a precipitate of \\"red cake\\" (see above). The red cake is then melted at 690 ¬∞C to produce the crude V2O5. Vanadium(V) oxide is produced when vanadium metal is heated with excess oxygen, but this product is contaminated with other, lower oxides. A more satisfactory laboratory preparation involves the decomposition of ammonium metavanadate at 500-550 ¬∞C: :2 NH4VO3 ‚Üí V2O5 \\\\+ 2 NH3 \\\\+ H2O Uses =Ferrovanadium production= In terms of quantity, the dominant use for vanadium(V) oxide is in the production of ferrovanadium (see above). The oxide is heated with scrap iron and ferrosilicon, with lime added to form a calcium silicate slag. Aluminium may also be used, producing the iron-vanadium alloy along with alumina as a by-product. =Sulfuric acid production= Another important use of vanadium(V) oxide is in the manufacture of sulfuric acid, an important industrial chemical with an annual worldwide production of 165 million metric tons in 2001, with an approximate value of US$8 billion. Vanadium(V) oxide serves the crucial purpose of catalysing the mildly exothermic oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide by air in the contact process: :2 SO2 \\\\+ O2 2 SO3 The discovery of this simple reaction, for which V2O5 is the most effective catalyst, allowed sulfuric acid to become the cheap commodity chemical it is today. The reaction is performed between 400 and 620 ¬∞C; below 400 ¬∞C the V2O5 is inactive as a catalyst, and above 620 ¬∞C it begins to break down. Since it is known that V2O5 can be reduced to VO2 by SO2, one likely catalytic cycle is as follows: :SO2 \\\\+ V2O5 ‚Üí SO3 \\\\+ 2VO2 followed by :2VO2 +¬ΩO2 ‚Üí V2O5 It is also used as catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx emissions in some power plants. Due to its effectiveness in converting sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide, and thereby sulfuric acid, special care must be taken with the operating temperatures and placement of a power plant's SCR unit when firing sulfur-containing fuels. =Other oxidations= Proposed early steps in the vanadium-catalyzed oxidation of naphthalene to phthalic anhydride, with V2O5 represented as a molecule vs its true extended structure. Maleic anhydride is produced by the V2O5-catalysed oxidation of butane with air: :C4H10 \\\\+ 4 O2 ‚Üí C2H2(CO)2O + 8 H2O Maleic anhydride is used for the production of polyester resins and alkyd resins.. Phthalic anhydride is produced similarly by V2O5-catalysed oxidation of ortho-xylene or naphthalene at 350‚Äì400 ¬∞C. The equation is for the xylene oxidation: :C6H4(CH3)2 \\\\+ 3 O2 ‚Üí C6H4(CO)2O + 3 H2O Phthalic anhydride is a precursor to plasticisers, used for conferring pliability to polymers. A variety of other industrial compounds are produced similarly, including adipic acid, acrylic acid, oxalic acid, and anthraquinone. =Other applications= Due to its high coefficient of thermal resistance, vanadium(V) oxide finds use as a detector material in bolometers and microbolometer arrays for thermal imaging. It also finds application as an ethanol sensor in ppm levels (up to 0.1 ppm). Vanadium redox batteries are a type of flow battery used for energy storage, including large power facilities such as wind farms. Biological activity right Vanadium(V) oxide exhibits very modest acute toxicity to humans, with an LD50 of about 470 mg/kg. The greater hazard is with inhalation of the dust, where the LD50 ranges from 4‚Äì11 mg/kg for a 14-day exposure.G√ºnter Bauer, Volker G√ºther, Hans Hess, Andreas Otto, Oskar Roidl, Heinz Roller, Siegfried Sattelberger \\"Vanadium and Vanadium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Vanadate (), formed by hydrolysis of V2O5 at high pH, appears to inhibit enzymes that process phosphate (PO43‚àí). However the mode of action remains elusive. References Further reading *. *.

It is one of the three main hospitals in the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust area and is named after William Harvey (1578‚Äì1657), the Folkestone-born doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system. History Statue of William Harvey by the hospital's entrance The hospital replaced an older hospital to the west of town that had been running since 1928. It was planned as part of an overall plan to expand Ashford and the surrounding area by relocating people away from London in the late 1960s. The government decided the existing hospital infrastructure would not be able to cope, and set about locating a site away from Ashford town centre, with a proposed area of around and a budget of ¬£7‚Äì8 million. Work started on building the hospital in 1973, and it was commissioned in 1977 and opened in 1979. The old hospital remained open as a smaller unit, and by the 1980s it had become a hospital for the elderly. The hospital currently employs about 2,500 people and has 476 beds as of March 2012. It includes a shop run by the Friends of the William Harvey Hospital, a volunteer run society that provides basic goods and services to patients and visitors, and has raised ¬£2.5 million in donations for the hospital. The Rotary Suite of the hospital is run by Spencer Private Hospitals, providing private treatments such as cosmetic surgery. In April 2014 it was reported that the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust was looking for a partner to develop a private unit at the William Harvey site and enhance the returns from the Spencer private hospital on the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital site with a contract over the next 15 years. Criticism In 1978, Keith Speed, MP for Ashford, criticised proposals that some services would require patients to be bussed back to the old hospital when William Harvey Hospital opened. In 2000, the press reported that staff shortages at the hospital were putting patient's lives at risk, which drew local MP Damian Green to criticise the management of the NHS in parliament. Green continued to complain about the state of the hospital, noting in 2001 that patients had been waiting in the accident and emergency department for 24 hours. In 2013, hospital staff members threatened to quit due to proposed increases in parking permit charges from March 2014. In some cases, the cost of a permit was planned to rise by over ¬£500. One staff member reported that \\"Every day on the news there's somebody slagging off the NHS. Nobody ever says anything nice about us. No wonder morale is low here.\\" See also * Healthcare in Kent * List of hospitals in England References External links * William Harvey Hospital * Spencer Private Hospitals Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1977 Category:Hospitals in Kent Category:Ashford, Kent Category:NHS hospitals in England ","title":"William Harvey Hospital"},{"id":"1910136","text":"Cyclotol is an explosive consisting of castable mixtures of RDX and TNT.

Gurmant and his wife, Nina Grewal, who represented Fleetwood‚ÄîPort Kells from 2004 to 2015, were the first married couple to serve in the House of Commons of Canada at the same time. First elected to the Canadian House of Commons on June 2, 1997 for the riding of Surrey Central and re-elected there on November 27, 2000, he represented the riding of Newton‚ÄîNorth Delta from 2004 until 2005. Grewal announced that he would not be running in the 2006 federal election over a dispute of alleged offer of patronage with the Liberal Party, which was governing at that time. As a Member of Parliament sitting in the caucus of the Reform Party from 1997 to 2000, the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2003 and then for the Conservative Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006, Grewal held the positions of Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition of Canada (1998-2000), Co-Chair of the Joint Standing Committee of the House and the Senate for Scrutiy of Regulations (1998-2005), Official Opposition Critic for Multiculturalism (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Scrutiny of Regulations (2001-2004), Official Opposition Critic for Canadians Abroad (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Asia Pacific (2001-2004) and Official Opposition Senior Critic for Foreign Affairs (1997-2004) Early life and career At the age of 8 Grewal and his brother were invited to the Vice President's Gallery United States Senate Chamber by Hubert Humphrey the Vice President of the United States. After earning BSc Honours and MBA and working as manager with reputed organisation in India, he emigrated to Liberia, prior to immigrating to Canada in 1991. In Liberia he was a manager, successful businessman and Assistant Professor of Business Management at the University of Liberia. Grewal wanted to help the suffering people and victims of the bloody civil war with medicines, food and clothes and intended to organize a charity to help in consultation with the office of the ambassador of Liberia. Grewal brothers had earlier written a letter advising the President of Liberia to launch a Green Revolution to grow more food that would help eliminate hunger, malnutrition and poverty. This advice generated some commotion, particularly by a reporter of the Province newspaper in 1995. The article construed that Grewal was an advisor to the military dictator, despite the Liberian Ambassador having issued a letter clarifying the issue. Grewal has denied any such connections to the former government of Liberia. Grewal appealed to the international community to help Liberia and its people. Federal politics In 1991, he emigrated to Canada. Within less than 6 years, he was elected as M.P. for the Reform Party of Canada in the federal riding of Surrey Central, in the 1997 federal election with 17,438 votes. In the 2000 federal election he won by getting 29,812 votes, 51.6% of the popular vote - a margin of 10,300 votes more than the Liberal candidate. However, in the 2004 federal election his margin of victory fell to 500 votes. As a Member of Parliament sitting in the caucus of the Reform Party from 1997 to 2000, the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2003 and then for the Conservative Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006, Grewal held the positions of Deputy House Leader of the Official Opposition of Canada (1998-2000), Co-Chair of the Joint Standing Committee of the House and the Senate for Scrutiy of Regulations (1998-2005), Official Opposition Critic for Multiculturalism (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Scrutiny of Regulations (2001-2004), Official Opposition Critic for Canadians Abroad (2004), Official Opposition Critic for Asia Pacific (2001-2004) and Official Opposition Senior Critic for Foreign Affairs (1997-2004). As a result of his wife, Nina Grewal, winning a seat in the 2004 federal election, the Grewals became the first married couple to serve concurrently in the Canadian House of Commons. =Immigration Bond Bill (C-284)= Grewal had introduced a Bill C-284 to allow a bond to be posted to secure visitor's visa, his Bill passed the vote in the House and was referred to Immigration committee in March 2005. On April 6, 2005, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Joe Volpe, asked the parliamentary Ethics Commissioner and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to investigate Grewal following his voluntary statement given to a parliamentary committee. In that testimony, Grewal had stated that he regularly asked those seeking his help in getting visitor visas for their relatives, if they would be willing to post bonds guaranteeing their return. Grewal contends that immigration bonds, as they have been practiced in Australia and New Zealand, could work as a way to prevent spurious refugee claims and illegal immigration; and assist law- abiding sponsors to secure visa for their loved ones to visit Canada without hassle. There is no evidence that any bond was actually signed (or any money exchanged for the bonds). On June 22, the ethics commissioner cleared him of any wrongdoing and stated that he never pocketed any money from the pledges. =The \\"Grewal tapes\\"= In mid-May, at the time the Liberal government risked losing a confidence vote on its 2005 budget (which was later decided in the government's favour by the speaker, after a tie in the house), the Liberals initiated negotiations with Grewal asking him to vote with the Liberals and join the Liberal Party of Canada. With a Liberal go-between, Ujjal Dosanjh, Minister of Health, and Tim Murphy, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister met with Grewal, on three occasions May 16‚Äì18, including Grewal's office. There were also 36 phone calls by the Liberals. In these negotiations Grewal was offered inducements to change parties in exchange for a senate seat for his wife, a cabinet post for himself, and an apology from Volpe. In response, Murphy and Dosanjh made vague promises of future reward. While these negotiations were going on, prominent Conservative MP Belinda Stronach defected to the Liberals and did receive a ministerial position in the government. In the end, Grewal did not change parties. Unbeknownst to his interlocutors, Grewal was recording the conversations, a fact that he voluntarily revealed to the public on the evening of May 18, where Grewal publicly accused the Liberals of trying to buy his vote with offers of a cabinet or a diplomatic post for himself and a senate seat for his wife. He had released excerpts of nine minutes of a recording of conversations with Murphy and Dosanjh, in which Murphy suggests that he abstain from the coming confidence vote. New Democratic Party MP Yvon Godin referred them to Bernard Shapiro, Parliamentary Ethics Commissioner and to the RCMP. On May 31, Grewal handed over recordings to Shapiro and the RCMP. Simultaneously he released an hour and 15 minutes of recordings and transcripts to the public. Several news outlets and the Liberals alleged that portions of the tape seemed to be edited, something that the Conservatives denied. On June 2, 2005, the Conservatives issued a news release admitting that two short sections had been accidentally omitted. In mid-August, the RCMP announced that there would be no further criminal investigation into the tapes and their contents and Grewal was cleared of any wrongdoing. On January 25, 2006, Shapiro released a heavily edited report from the draft reports and stated, \\"While it is not clear whether Mr. Grewal genuinely sought an inducement to change his vote or whether he just acted the part in an attempt to entrap Mr. Dosanjh, his actions were, in either case, extremely inappropriate\\". The report also said that Grewal's behaviour violated the spirit of the MPs‚Äô Code of Conduct. The Liberals claimed that it was Grewal who approached them seeking patronage appointments for himself and his wife in exchange for their votes. Grewal did not run for re-election in 2006, saying he did not want the controversies surrounding his behaviour to be a distraction during the campaign. =Attempted political comeback= Grewal had planned to stand for the Conservatives in the new riding of Cloverdale‚ÄîLangley City in the 2015 federal election, spending two years to sign up 1,500 party members in his pursuit of the nomination, but in November 2014 he was barred by the party from seeking the nomination. His son, Liv Grewal, was to run for the Conservatives in Mission‚ÄîMatsqui‚ÄîFraser Canyon after defeating four other candidates to win the nomination but was subsequently forced by the party to withdraw. In 2018, Grewal announced his support for ex-Conservative MP Maxime Bernier's new party, the People's Party of Canada. Awards and accolades In 2002, he was awarded the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal for service to Canada. In 2003, then the Leader of the Opposition Stephen Harper Prime Minister of Canada called Grewal \\"the Ironman of Canadian Parliament\\". In 2012, Grewal was awarded Doctor of Philosophy in Political Science and Diplomacy Honoris Causa degree by the Caucasus University in Georgia. Grewal was awarded the 'World Sikh Award' in 2012 at London, U.K. and he was listed 27th most influential Sikh in the world.

Nomenclature and etymology  The genus name Melia is derived from (), the Greek word used by Theophrastus (c. 371 ‚Äì c. 287 BC) for Fraxinus ornus, which has similar leaves. The species azedarach is from the French 'az√©darac' which in turn is from the Persian 'ƒÅzƒÅd dirakht' (ÿßÿ≤ÿßÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ™ ) meaning 'free- or noble tree'.Merriam-Webster Melia azedarach should not be confused with the Azadirachta trees, which are in the same family, but a different genus.  Uses and ecology  Indian grey hornbill (196x196px Keokea, Maui, Hawaii. Large trees can be profitably used for timber.179x179px Melia azedarach - 180x180px 180x180px The main utility of chinaberry is its timber. This is of medium density, and ranges in colour from light brown to dark red. In appearance it is readily confused with the unrelated Burmese teak (Tectona grandis). Melia azedarach ‚Äì in keeping with other members of the family Meliaceae ‚Äì has a timber of high quality, but as opposed to many almost- extinct species of mahogany, it is under-utilised. Seasoning is relatively simple, in that planks dry without cracking or warping and are resistant to fungal infection. The taste of the leaves is not as bitter as neem (Azadirachta indica). The tough five-grooved seeds were widely used for making rosaries and other products requiring beads; however, the seeds were later replaced by plastics. The cut branches with mature fruit are sold commercially to the florist and landscaping trade particularly as a component for outdoor holiday d√©cor. The fruits may persist for some time prior to shattering off the stem or discoloring, which occurs rapidly after a relatively short time in subfreezing weather. Some hummingbirds like the sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea), glittering-bellied emerald (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and planalto hermit (Phaethornis pretrei) have been recorded as feeding on and pollinating the flowers; these only take it opportunistically.Baza Mendon√ßa & dos Anjos (2005) In Kenya the trees have been grown by farmers and used as fodder trees. The leaves can be fed to cattle to improve milk yields and improve farm incomes.http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/Forestry/DFID_impact_case_study_Fodder_trees_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf In Australia, particularly the suburbs of Melbourne, the tree is often used in nature strip plantings by local councils. The councils plant such trees for amenity reasons as well as environmental, social and economic benefits.  Toxicity  The fruits have evolved to be eaten by animals which eat the flesh surrounding the hard endocarp or ingest the entire fruit and later vent the endocarp. If the endocarp is crushed or damaged during ingestion or digestion, the animal will be exposed to the toxins within the seed. The processes of mastication and digestion, and the degree of immunity to the particular toxins, vary widely between species, and there will accordingly be a great variation in the clinical symptoms following ingestion.'Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa' - John Mitchell Watt & Maria Gerdina Breyer-Brandwijk (E&S; Livingstone, 1962) Fruits are poisonous or narcotic to humans if eaten in quantity.Russell et al. (1997) However, like those of the yew tree, these toxins are not harmful to birds, who gorge themselves on the fruit, eventually reaching a \\"drunken\\" state. The birds that are able to eat the fruit spread the seeds in their droppings. The toxins are neurotoxins and unidentified resins, found mainly in the fruits. The first symptoms of poisoning appear a few hours after ingestion. They may include loss of appetite, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, bloody faeces, stomach pain, pulmonary congestion, cardiac arrest, rigidity, lack of coordination and general weakness. Death may take place after about 24 hours. Like in relatives, tetranortriterpenoids constitute an important toxic principle. These are chemically related to azadirachtin, the primary insecticidal compound in the commercially important neem oil. These compounds are probably related to the wood and seed's resistance to pest infestation, and maybe to the unattractiveness of the flowers to animals. Leaves have been used as a natural insecticide to keep with stored food, but must not be eaten as they are highly poisonous. Chinaberry fruit was used to prevent insect larvae from growing in the fruit. By placing the berries in drying apples (etc.) and keeping the fruit turned in the sun without damaging any of the chinaberry skin, the fruit will dry and not have insect larvae in the dried apples. A diluted infusion of leaves and trees has been used in the past to induce uterus relaxation.  As invasive species  The plant was introduced around 1830 as an ornamental in the United States (South Carolina and Georgia) and widely planted in southern states. Today it is considered an invasive species by some groups as far north as Virginia and Oklahoma.Langeland & Burks But nurseries continue to sell the trees, and seeds are also widely available. It has become naturalized to tropical and warm temperate regions of the Americas and is planted in similar climates around the world. Besides the problem of toxicity, its usefulness as a shade tree in the United States is diminished by its tendency to sprout where unwanted and to turn sidewalks into dangerously slippery surfaces when the fruits fall, though this is not a problem where songbird populations are in good shape. As noted above, the possibility of commercially profitable harvesting of feral stands remains largely unexplored.

Rezayee was a rising star in the post-Taliban ruled Afghanistan, specially very popular among the youth. She was also the first female western-style music presenter to appear on television in Afghanistan's conservative history. In March 2005, Shaima Rezayee lost her job on the popular show Hop, an Afghan programme with content similar to the global music video channel MTV, after the programme was criticised by local Islamic clerics. One of the most outspoken critics of Hop was Fazl Hadi Shinwari, a chief justice of the Afghan Supreme Court. He was quoted as saying \\"It [Hop] will corrupt our society, culture and most importantly, it will take our people away from Islam and destroy our country... This will make our people accept another culture, and make our country a laughing stock around the world.\\" Rezayee herself was a central focus of the criticism, mainly for her western style of dress. This was believed by the religious authorities to be 'corrupting' the youth of Afghanistan. The only female presenter on the show, Rezayee with her family had fled her home in Kabul to neighboring Pakistan during the five years that the Taliban controlled Kabul. On 18 May 2005, Rezayee was shot dead at her home in Char Qala, a neighbourhood of Kabul. She was the first journalist to be killed in Afghanistan since the end of the Afghan civil war in 2001. Press freedom organisation Reporters sans fronti√®res and local authorities believe her killing was linked to her work as a presenter on Tolo TV. Tolo TV is the first private TV station established in Afghanistan. Previously, there has always been only one TV station in Kabul which was run and controlled by the government.

He began his career in the Asian Underground scene and later became internationally known for his bhangra tracks, his Hindi remixes, and as a pioneer of Asian-R&B; fusion music. Through the Rishi Rich Project, he was responsible for launching British Asian talents who would later gain mainstream success, such as Jay Sean, Juggy D, Veronica Mehta, and Mumzy Stranger. He has also released his own solo albums, Simply Rich in 2002 with Ishq Records and The Project in 2006 with 2point9 Records and his produced songs have appeared in a number of Bollywood films.

Two victims, , age 10, and , age 11, were murdered by a 14-year-old boy reportedly named Shinichiro Azuma,https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east- asia/article/1858474/japanese-tabloid-defies-privacy-laws-expose-identity-man- who under the alias . The perpetrator was arrested on June 28, 1997 in connection with the Hase murder, and later confessed to both murders. As a juvenile offender, he was prosecuted and convicted as \\"Boy A\\". His real name has not been officially released to the press because Japanese law prohibits publishing the identification, but in some weekly magazines his real name has been reported. Beginning in 2004, \\"Boy A\\" was released on a provisional basis, with a full release announced to follow on January 1, 2005. The murders and subsequent release of the perpetrator gained widespread attention from Japanese media and politicians. The murders Murder victim Jun Hase On May 27, 1997, the head of , a special education pupil at Tainohata Elementary School, was found in front of the school gate hours before pupils arrived for classes. Hase had been beheaded with a handsaw, with further mutilations being done before being left in front of the school, for students to discover when they arrived in the morning. A note, written in red pen, was found stuffed in his mouth, identifying the killer as \\"Sakakibara.\\" The note read: > \\"This is the beginning of the game... Try to stop me if you can you stupid > police... I desperately want to see people die, it is a thrill for me to > commit murder. A bloody judgment is needed for my years of great > bitterness.\\"„Åï„ÅÇ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„ÅÆÂßã„Åæ„Çä„Åß„Åô ÊÑöÈàç„Å™Ë≠¶ÂØüË´∏Âêõ „Éú„ÇØ„ÇíÊ≠¢„ÇÅ„Å¶„Åø„Åü„Åæ„Åà „Éú„ÇØ„ÅØÊÆ∫„Åó„ÅåÊÑâÂø´„Åß„Åü„Åæ„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ ‰∫∫„ÅÆÊ≠ª„ÅåË¶ã„Åü„Åè„Å¶Ë¶ã„Åü„Åè„Å¶„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åå„Å™„ÅÑ > Ê±ö„ÅÑÈáéËèúÂÖ±„Å´„ÅØÊ≠ª„ÅÆÂà∂Ë£Å„Çí Á©çÂπ¥„ÅÆÂ§ßÊÄ®„Å´ÊµÅË°Ä„ÅÆË£Å„Åç„Çí Additionally, some English was on the note as well: \\"shooll killer\\". Police commented that the style of Hase's killing and the note was reminiscent of that of the Zodiac murders in the San Francisco area during the late 1960s. On June 6, a letter was sent to the newspaper Kobe Shinbun, in which Sakakibara claimed responsibility for the slaying and decapitation of Jun Hase, and threatened that more killings would follow. This second letter, delivered in a brown envelope postmarked June 3, had no return address or name. Enclosed was a three-page, 1400-word letter, also written in red ink, which included a six- character name that can be pronounced as \\"Sakakibara Seito\\". The same characters, which mean alcohol, devil, rose, saint and fight, were used in the first message that was inserted into the boy's mouth. Beginning with the phrase \\"Now, it's the beginning of a game\\", the letter stated that \\"I am putting my life at stake for the sake of this game... If I'm caught, I'll probably be hanged... police should be angrier and more tenacious in pursuing me.... It's only when I kill that I am liberated from the constant hatred that I suffer and that I am able to attain peace. It is only when I give pain to people that I can ease my own pain.\\" The letter also lashed out against the Japanese educational system, calling it \\"compulsory education that formed me, an invisible person.\\" In the initial panic, the Japanese media misreported the name as \\"Onibara\\" - Demon's Rose, though the killer insisted it was as he gave it. Infuriated by the mixup, Sakakibara later wrote to the station, \\"From now on, if you misread my name or spoil my mood I will kill three vegetables a week.... If you think I can only kill children you are greatly mistaken.\\" (In this context, the \\"vegetables\\" that Sakakibara meant were humans with developmental disabilities). A 14-year-old junior high school student was arrested as a suspect in the Hase murder on June 28. Shortly after his arrest, \\"Boy A\\" also confessed to the murder of a 10-year-old girl, Ayaka Yamashita (Â±±‰∏ãÂΩ©Ëä± Yamashita Ayaka), on March 16, as well as the assaults of three other girls on and around that same date. After the March 16 attack, he wrote in his diary: \\"I carried out sacred experiments today to confirm how fragile human beings are... I brought the hammer down, when the girl turned to face me. I think I hit her a few times but I was too excited to remember.\\" The following week, on March 23, he added: \\"This morning my mom told me, 'Poor girl. The girl attacked seems to have died.' There is no sign of me being caught... I thank you, \\"Bamoid≈çkishin\\", for this... Please continue to protect me.\\" Aftermath and controversy After the murders, Japanese politician Shizuka Kamei called for restricting objectionable content, stating, \\"Movies lacking any literary or educational merit made for just showing cruel scenes... Adults should be blamed for this\\", and that \\"[the incident] gives adults the chance to rethink the policy of self-imposed restrictions on these films and whether they should allow them just because they are profitable.\\" In 2000, Japan's bicameral legislature lowered the age for criminal responsibility from 16 to 14. However, in the wake of the June 1, 2004 murder of Satomi Mitarai by 11-year-old \\"Girl A\\" (Sasebo slashing), there has been some discussion for the need for further revision. On March 11, 2004, in an unprecedented act, the Japanese Ministry of Justice announced that Sakakibara, 21 at the time, was being released on a provisional basis, with a full release to follow on January 1, 2005. Critics have charged that since the government had taken the unusual step of notifying the public, that Sakakibara was likely not fit for release and should be transferred to prison. In the wake of the Sasebo slashing, three months later, this criticism was exacerbated. Due to the seriousness of the crimes and the fact that they had been committed by a minor, his name and new residence to this day remain a highly-guarded secret. Nonetheless, his real name has been circulated on the internet since June 29, 1997, according to journalist Fumihiko Takayama. A number of people, including Sh≈çjir≈ç Got≈ç (a lawyer who dealt with many false accusation cases), Hidehiko Kumagai and Nobuyoshi Iwata (former principal of the junior high school that Boy A attended), insist that Boy A was wrongfully accused and point out contradictions in the statements of the investigating authorities, for example: * Police investigators said that one of the murders was made by a left-handed person: Boy A is right-handed. * Boy A's confession contained many absurd statements and claims of things that would be impossible for a 14-year- old to do. * Boy A had bad grades, and yet his confession was complex (if cryptic) and contained many elaborate figures of speech and similes. In 2002, the boy's mother visited him in prison and asked him if he had really committed the crimes. He affirmed this to her.‰∏ÄÊ©ãÊñáÂìâ „ÄéÊú™Ëß£Ê±∫ ‚ÄîÂ∞ÅÂç∞„Åï„Çå„Åü‰∫î„Å§„ÅÆÊçúÊüªÂ†±Âëä‚Äî„Äè Êñ∞ÊΩÆÊñáÂ∫´„ÄÅ2011Âπ¥11Êúà1Êó•„ÄÇ. p.378 In June 2015, Sakakibara, then aged 32, released an autobiography through Ohta Publishing titled Zekka (Áµ∂Ê≠å), in which he claimed to express regret for his crimes and recounted the murders in graphic detail.Controversial autobiography of 1997 Kobe child killer released, Japan Today, 06-15-15 (Retrieved 3-14-18) Despite attempts by Jun Hase's family to block the release of Zekka, and despite one bookstore chain refusing to stock the book, it quickly reached the top of Japanese bestseller lists.Child serial killer‚Äôs memoir a hot seller, hot potato, The Japan Times, 07-01-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18) A few months later, Sakakibara set up a vanity website in which he posted bizarre photoshopped images of a nude male, suggested to be himself.Japan's Notorious \\"Boy A\\" Killer Now Has a Creepy Vanity Website, Cheryl Eddy, Gizmodo.com, 09-11-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18) In response to these controversies, the tabloid Sh≈´kan Post publicized Sakakibara's real name to be Shinichiro Azuma, his occupation at the time, and his location.Japanese tabloid defies privacy laws to expose identity of man who carried out the 'Kobe child murders' at age 14, South China Morning Post, 09-15-15 (Retrieved 03-14-18) See also *List of major crimes in Japan *Neomugicha incident *Sasebo slashing *Son of Sam law Notes References External links *Sympathy for the devil Al-Ahram Weekly, March 18, 1999 *Á•ûÊà∏‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÅÆÁúüÁõ∏„ÇíÁ©∂Êòé„Åô„Çã‰ºö The meeting which studies the truth of Kobe case Category:1997 murders in Asia Category:1990s murders in Japan Category:People from Kobe Category:Japanese murderers of children Category:Murder committed by minors Category:1997 crimes in Japan Category:Murdered Japanese children Category:Serial murders in Japan Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Violence against children ","title":"Kobe child murders"},{"id":"1910211","text":"Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) was the corporate and brand name of the Tampa, Florida wrestling office existing from 1961, when Eddie Graham first bought into the promotion, until 1987, when it closed down. It is also referred to as Florida Championship Wrestling. When Mike Graham tried a return to promoting, the rights to the name had been acquired by an outside party, forcing him to use another name, Florida Championship Wrestling. History =Founding= The original owner and promoter was \\"Cowboy\\" Clarence Preston Luttrall, a former journeyman heel wrestler who once fought a widely publicized boxing match, resulting from a wrestling angle, with a forty- something Jack Dempsey. It worked but Cowboy took a severe beating. Cowboy opened the office in 1949, and Eddie Graham bought into the promotion in 1961, then took over completely in 1971, because of health reasons with Cowboy. The office was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance during the entire CWF era, Eddie Graham serving two terms as NWA president, and loosely aligned before that, with other 'world' champions sometimes defending their titles. CWF became a staple in many Southern households in the 1970s and 1980s, with Dusty Rhodes arguably its most noted headliner, his babyface turn beginning in 1973 against former partner Pak Song. The promotion competed against other syndicated shows on Saturday night like The Lawrence Welk Show and Solid Gold for years. =Notable stars= The promotion thrived with stars such as NWA champions Lou Thesz and Gene Kiniski, Graham, Don Curtis, Sam Steamboat, The Magnificent Muraco (Don Muraco), the Great Malenko (Larry Simon), Johnny Valentine, Hiro Matsuda, Bob Orton Sr. and later Jr., Joe Scarpa (later Chief Jay Strongbow), Wahoo McDaniel, the Funks (Terry and Dory, Jr.), the Briscos (Jack and Jerry), Buddy Colt (Ron Read), Dusty Rhodes,Blackjack Mulligan, Bruiser Brody, Kendall Windham, Barry Windham, Mike Rotunda,Lex Lugar, Rick Rood,Harley Race,Andre the Giant,Jim Duggan, Hacksaw Butch Reed, Rick Steiner,The Freebirds, Cactus Jack, Scott Hall, Terry Allen, Bruiser Brody, Percy Pringle, Luna Vachon,Jimmy Garvin,Adrian Street,Hector Guerreo,Chavo Guerro,Sir Oliver Humperdinck,One Man Gang,J.J.Dillon, Gary Hart,Bob Roop,Mark Lewin,Dutch Mantel Mike Graham (Eddie's son), The Sheepherders, Kevin Sullivan ‚Äì whose cult-like Army of Darkness got tremendous heat from the fans ‚Äì and, in the words of the promotion's legendary commentator and a star in his own right Gordon Solie, 'a host of others'. Solie's deadpan interviewing style often buoyed the outlandish behavior and actions of Sullivan and his minions, bringing a legitimacy to the on-air segments no matter what depths Sullivan would descend to. Dusty Rhodes stands out among the noted performers because of the number of rivalries he had on air through most of CWF's broadcasting history. Well known heels, newcomers and babyfaces who turned heel during their tenure with CWF often sought out Rhodes to make their names in the territory. His rivals over the years included Superstar Billy Graham, Ray Stevens, Ernie Ladd, Ivan Koloff, Ox Baker, Ron Bass, Kamala, Abdullah the Butcher, Ric Flair, his old Texas Outlaws partner Dick Murdoch and of course, Kevin Sullivan (wrestler). =After Eddie Graham's suicide= When Eddie Graham committed suicide in January 1985, due to a combination of personal and business problems, responsibility for the office went to Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka, both of whom bought in during the 1960s. The other remaining owners were Mike Graham, Eddie's brother Skip Gossett, Dusty Rhodes and Buddy Colt. The promotion continued losing money and merged with Jim Crockett Promotions in February 1987.N.W.A. Championship Wrestling from Florida Most of the stars had gone to Jim Crockett Promotions or the WWF by that point. =Television programs and tape library= CWF filmed and later taped its weekly TV wrestling show at the famed Sportatorium at 106 N. Albany in Tampa, Fla., which was in reality a small television studio with seating for a live audience of about 100 people (1/40th of the seating capacity of its Dallas counterpart), with the wrestling office and gym in the same building. Arena footage was always also used, and full arena show broadcasts began in the early '80s. CWF Spin-off shows were Championship Wrestling Superstars, Global Wrestling, North Florida Championship Wrestling, United States Class Wrestling, American Championship Wrestling and Southern Professional Wrestling. On March 2, 2006, it was announced that the CWF library was purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for the DVD on Dusty Rhodes. Gordon Solie was featured at the end of WWE's FCW TV show, FCW TV in a tribute to CWF and himself. Howard Brody started NWA Florida in 1990 and he booked for it until 2002. In 2003, Kevin Rhodes started Championship Wrestling from Florida as a member of the NWA. He occasionally has some stars of 1980s wrestling appear in his promotion. In 2007, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) revived the promotion as a developmental territory under the name Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). In 2012, the promotion began operating under the NXT Wrestling banner, dropping references to FCW. On June 28, 2013, the WWE formally shuttered the Florida Championship Wrestling Arena, moving all equipment and personnel to the WWE Performance Facility in Orlando. =Alumni= *Abdullah the Butcher *Johnny Ace *Bill Alfonso (referee) *Vic Steamboat *Bad News Allen *Lars Anderson *Andr√© the Giant *Brad Armstrong *Steve Armstrong *Bob Armstrong *The Assassins *Norvell Austin *Bob Backlund *Jim Backlund *Ox Baker *The Barbarian *Jesse Barr *Black Bart *Ron Bass *Red Bastien *Brian Blair *Nick Bockwinkel *Bounty Hunter *Bounty Hunter2 *Bobo Brazil *Jack Brisco *Jerry Brisco *Bruiser Brody *Jerry Brown *Bad Bad Leroy Brown *Denny Brown *Dewey Forte *Haystack Calhoun *Ray Candy *Chris Champion *The Cuban Assassin *Buddy Colt *Bob Cook *Charlie Cook *Mike Davis *J.J.

Upon the creation of a new Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in 1987, those newly hired after that date cannot participate in CSRS. CSRS continues to provide retirement benefits to those eligible to receive them. CSRS is a defined-benefit plan, akin to a pension. Notably, though, CSRS employees do not participate in Social Security (unless having worked in the private sector beforehand, and then subject to penalties). Employees hired after 1983 are required to be covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which is a three tiered retirement system with a smaller defined benefit (pension), Social Security, and a 401(k)-style system called the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The defined benefits of both the CSRS and the FERS systems are paid out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, which had a projected balance of $898 billion as of September 30, 2017.Budget of the United States Government, FY2019, published February 12, 2018. Office of Management and Budget, Retrieved February 15, 2018 With changes in the determining retirement coverage of federal employees under FERS or CSRS, those employees who are later rehired that were previously covered under CSRS will retain their CSRS coverage if they meet certain service rules. In general, if rehired employees have 5 years of civilian service as of December 31, 1986, they will retain CSRS coverage. However, if the break in service is greater than 365 days, the employee is also covered under Social Security and will be deemed CSRS Offset. Overall benefits paid to CSRS or CSRS Offset employees will remain equitable based on the number of years of creditable service and CSRS formula upon retirement. CSRS and CSRS Offset employees with a break in service more than three days are also eligible to elect coverage under FERS within the first six months of rehire. Employees who were previously covered under CSRS and do not meet the 5 year retirement coverage rule are automatically covered under the FERS upon rehire.

Tarot was created by Paul Foster Case, founder of B.O.T.A. and artist Jessie Burns Parke. Although it is based upon, and for the most part closely resembles, Arthur Edward Waite's 1910 Rider-Waite deck,White, Douglass A. Thoth and the Tarot, pp. 13-14 Case changed what he said were mistakes or \\"blinds\\" on part of Waite.Case, Paul Foster. The Tarot, A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages.Case, Paul Foster. Highlights of Tarot.Case, Paul Foster. The Book of Tokens, Tarot Meditations. The B.O.T.A. Tarot is presented in several editions: the standard-sized full deck and a larger version containing only the Major Arcana (trump cards; often called 'tarot keys' by Case) are black and white, since Case believed that every student needed to color their own deck. After his death, the Major Arcana became also available in color. Each of these cards has a border of a particular color, which is the color that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. Every trump card has a Hebrew letter written on it in the lower right corner, which is the letter that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. In contrast to some earlier occult tarot decks, which place the fool card last in order, and associate it with the second-to-last Hebrew letter, shin (such decks order the last Hebrew letter, tav, before shin), the B.O.T.A. deck places the fool card first in order, and therefore associates it with the first Hebrew letter, aleph. It also orders shin before tav, in the correct order of Hebrew letters. Differences with the Rider-Waite deck All of the illustrations on the cards of the BOTA deck differ in at least some minor way from those of the Rider-Waite deck, but some cards contrast much more than others. The card that contrasts the most between the two decks is the death card. In the Rider-Waite deck, the death card depicts death as an armored knight on a horse, carrying a banner, whereas in the BOTA deck, the death card depicts death as a bare skeleton with a scythe, with a red sky in the background, being based upon the death card of the Marseille tarot deck. In the Rider-Waite deck, the sun card depicts a nude child on a horse, carrying a dull-red banner, whereas in the BOTA deck, the sun card depicts two nude children standing in a field, being based upon the sun card of the Marseille tarot deck. The Tarot Tableau In his book The Tarot, Case published the Hebrew letter attributions of the Golden Dawn for the first time. Also made public was the tarot tableau, a pattern for laying out all of the tarot cards which reveals certain relationships and dissimilarities among them. This tableau was used by the American branch of Alpha et Omega when Case was the 'praemonstrator' (chief instructor) of that order's Thoth-Hermes lodge in Chicago. The tarot tableau is an arrangement of the 22 major arcana cards into 4 horizontal rows that span across 7 vertical columns. On the top row there is only the fool card, in the center of the row. Rows two through four consist of 7 cards each, arranged in sequential order, such that cards 1 through 7 are on row two, cards 8 through 14 are on row three, and cards 15 through 21 are on row four. Use in meditation and intuition B.O.T.A. repeatedly emphasizes that tarot cards are primarily a tool for meditation, not fortune-telling. P.F. Case invented a new, non-magical definition for the word 'divination', his new definition being \\"the use of spiritual intuition to find solutions to problems\\". After explaining the B.O.T.A. method for tarot divination in his book titled 'The Tarot, A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages', Case specifically explains the differences between this particular type of divination and fortune-telling. Case then closes with the warning: \\"Finally, let me reiterate the thought that this is not to be used for vulgar fortune telling, or to amuse a party of friends. If you yield to the temptation so to abuse this information, you will pay for it in the loss of all power of true divination, and probably in the loss of ability to control the higher rates of psychic vibration.\\"Case, Paul Foster. The Tarot, A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages. pp 223 The BOTA tarot deck and the Cube of Space The Tarot was the first published book to reveal almost all of the tarot attributions on the 'Cube of Space' diagram. There are 22 major arcana tarot cards, which correspond to 22 components of the Cube of Space. The Sepher Yetzirah is the source of the link between the Cube of Space and the Hebrew letters.Kaplan, Aryeh. Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation in Theory and Practice. The Sepher Yetzirah itself does not directly mention a 'cube of space', nor any kind of cube. Case based the Cube of Space upon two verses in the Sepher Yetzirah. One of those verses is in chapter 4 and the other verse is in chapter 5. The verse in chapter 4 associates 6 Hebrew letters with six cardinal directions (up, down, east, west, north, south). The verse in chapter 5 associates 12 Hebrew letters with either 12 diagonal directional 'arms' or 12 diagonal boundaries (different translations contradict each other), which would refer to the 12 edges of an octahedron, though Paul Foster Case interpreted these as the 12 edges of a cube. P.F. Case furthermore associated this 'Cube of Space' with the 'Tree of Life' of Kabbala. He based that association upon paragraph 95 of the Sepher Ha-Bahir. That paragraph does not actually mention the Tree of Life though, but simply a tree. Paragraph 95 states that a tree is inside the twelve diagonal boundary lines that are mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah. Because the Tree of Life consists of 10 sephiroth, P.F. Case associated the three 'mother' letters (aleph, mem, shin) and seven 'double' letters of the Sepher Yetzirah with ten corresponding sephiroth. Until the publication of The Tarot, most English- speaking occultists had never heard of Case's Cube of Space concept, much less were they aware of how it related to the much better-known 'Tree of Life' diagram.Townley, Kevin. The Cube of Space: Container of Creation In fact, until the mid-1990s, there were almost no other books in print which even mentioned the Cube of Space. The ones that do defer to Case's writings on the subject.Hulse, David Allen. New Dimensions for the Cube of Space: The Path of Initiation Revealed by the Tarot upon the Qabalistic Cube.

United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993), was a United States Supreme Court decision that determined that the question of whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be resolved in the courts.. Background The Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Walter Nixon, was convicted of committing perjury before a grand jury but refused to resign from office even after he had been incarcerated. Nixon was subsequently impeached by the US House of Representatives, and the matter was referred to the Senate for a vote on Nixon's removal. The Senate appointed a committee to hear the evidence against Nixon and later report to the body as a whole. The Senate then heard the report of the committee and voted to remove Nixon from office. Nixon contended that this did not meet the constitutional requirement of Article I for the case to be \\"tried by the Senate.\\" Decision The court's decision was unanimous, but four separate opinions were published. The majority opinion, by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, held that the courts may not review the impeachment and trial of a federal officer because the Constitution reserves that function to a coordinate political branch. Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution gives the Senate the \\"sole power to try all impeachments.\\" Because of the word sole it is clear that the judicial branch was not to be included. Furthermore, because the word try was originally understood to include factfinding committees, there was a textually demonstrable commitment to give broad discretion to the Senate in impeachments. Furthermore the Framers believed that representatives of the people should try impeachments, and the Court was too small to justly try impeachments. Also, the judicial branch is \\"checked\\" by impeachments, so judicial involvement in impeachments might violate the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Court further ruled that involving the judiciary would prevent finality without clear remedy and bias post-impeachment criminal or civil prosecutions, which the Constitution explicitly allows. Justices Byron White, Harry Blackmun, and David Souter concurred, but voiced concern that the Court was foreclosing the area for review. While they found that the Senate had done all that was constitutionally required, they were concerned that the Court should have the power to review cases in which the Senate removed an impeached officer summarily without a hearing, or through some arbitrary process such as \\"a coin toss.\\" An important feature of this case is how it diverges from Powell v. McCormack (1969). In Powell, a grant of discretionary power to Congress was deemed to be justiciable because it required a mere \\"interpretation\\" of the Constitution.

He directed films such as Vidas Secas (Barren Lives), based on the book with the same name by Brazilian writer Graciliano Ramos. Biography Pereira dos Santos, named in honor of Almirante Horatio Nelson, was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Himself a frequenter of the cinema, Pereira dos Santos's father brought his very young son to the movie theater for the first time. By secondary school Pereira dos Santos was already fond of literature, and at 15 years old he joined the Brazilian Communist Party and became close to one of its other members, Astrogildo Pereira. At the time the party was considered illegal by the government of Get√∫lio Vargas. The first feature film he directed was Rio 40¬∞, which was released in 1955. The film is a chronicle of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, and it influenced several other directors, spurring the Cinema Novo movement. In 1963, Pereira dos Santos was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. His most well-known film outside Brazil is Como Era Gostoso o Meu Franc√™s (How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, 1971). It was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival. The film takes place in the sixteenth century and details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the (now extinct) indigenous Tupinamba warrior tribe against the French and Portuguese colonizers of the Brazilian littoral. The film is something of a black comedy about European colonialism‚Äîone that makes satirical use of the Brazilian modernist trope of Antropofagia (\\"cultural cannibalism\\"), then recently revived by the Tropicalismo movement of the 1960s‚Äîas well as a bitter commentary on the historical genocide of the indigenous tribes in Latin America and the gradual destruction of their civilization. His 1994 film The Third Bank of the River was entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. Pereira dos Santos' 2006 film Bras√≠lia 18% explores some of the darker aspects of contemporary Brazilian politics such as political corruption, the murder of trial witnesses, and money laundering. Pereira dos Santos was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2006. Death Pereira dos Santos died of multiple organ failure in Rio de Janeiro on 12 April 2018. He was 89.

In 1980 the Cotton Belt began operating the Rock Island's Golden State Route which added the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico to the operation. It operated as a Southern Pacific subsidiary from 1932 until the operation of the Cotton Belt was assumed by Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1992. Corporate history Bond of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, issued 12. February 1891 The Cotton Belt was part of the railroad empire acquired by financier Jay Gould in the last quarter of the 19th century. \\"By 1890 Gould owned the Missouri Pacific, the Texas and Pacific, the St. Louis Southwestern, and the International-Great Northern, one-half of the mileage in the Southwest\\", the Handbook of Texas wrote. The railroad was organized on January 15, 1891, although it had its origins in a series of short lines founded in Tyler, Texas, in 1870 that connected northeastern Texas to Arkansas and southeastern Missouri. Construction of the original Tyler Tap Railroad began in the summer of 1875. On October 18, 1903, the Cotton Belt gained trackage rights over the Missouri Pacific Railroad along the eastern shore of the Mississippi River to reach East St. Louis, Illinois, and then used Terminal Railroad Association trackage rights into St. Louis. The Cotton Belt operated a freight station in downtown St. Louis, but its main base of operations in the area was its yard and a locomotive servicing facility in East St. Louis, just east of Valley Junction, and south of Alton and Southern Railroad's Gateway Yard, and north of Kansas City Southern's East St. Louis Yard. Union Pacific Railroad now operates Cotton Belt Yard, although the engine servicing facilities have been demolished. Cotton Belt boxcar at Texas City, Galveston County, Texas The Cotton Belt and its subsidiary St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas operated 1,607 miles of road in 1945; 1,555 miles in 1965; and 2,115 miles in 1981 after taking over the Rock Island's Golden State Route. In 1925, SSW and SSW of Texas reported a total of 1,474 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 75 million passenger-miles; in 1970 it carried 8,650 million ton-miles and no passengers. The Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) assumed control of the SSW on April 14, 1932 and operated as a subsidiary of SP until 1992, when the Southern Pacific consolidated the Cotton Belt's operations into the parent company. Southern Pacific merged with Union Pacific Railroad in 1996. Passenger service SSW EMD GP60 9673 in Caliente, California The Cotton Belt ran passenger trains from St. Louis to Texas and from Memphis to Dallas and Shreveport, Louisiana. Cotton Belt's Lone Star operated from Memphis Union Station to Dallas Union Terminal with a connecting section from Lewisville, Arkansas, to Shreveport. The Morning Star was the second named train over much of this route, operating out of St. Louis Union Station to Dallas, with a separate Memphis section inaugurated in 1941 to provide a convenient connection with the Southern Railway's Tennessean to and from Washington, D.C., and New York City. The Cotton Belt also operated passenger trains between Mt. Pleasant, Tyler and Waco, and a doodlebug between Tyler and Lufkin. The Cotton Belt began a series of passenger train cutbacks in the early 1950s. The railroad had 25 steam engines and four gas-electric motor cars available for passenger service in 1949. By late 1952 nine diesels had replaced the steam locomotives and motorcars and passenger train mileage had been trimmed considerably. The final operations in Texas involved overnight service between St. Louis and Dallas, with major intermediate stops in Jonesboro, Pine Bluff, Texarkana and Tyler. The Cotton Belt was one of the first Class 1 lines in the southwest to discontinue passenger service. The last Cotton Belt passenger train, #8, operated on November 30, 1959, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to East St. Louis, Illinois.SSW GE B40-8 8067 in Colton, California St. Louis Southwestern No. 819 on an early excursion run in 1986 Notable employees *Louisiana politician Andrew R.

Japanese people themselves are partly descended from populations originating in the Russian Far East.  Russian missions  The Russian Mission, or Orthodox Church of Russia in Japan, dates from 1861. A hospital had been previously built at Hakodate for Russians and Japanese. The Rev. Nikolai Kasatkin (later St Nicholas of Japan), was attached to it as chaplain with a church near the hospital. The hospital was destroyed by fire, though the church remained and Nicholas stayed as a missionary at Hakodate, where he baptized a number of Japanese. In 1870 the Russian minister to Japan obtained a grant of a special territory as a branch of the Russian legation at Surugadai at the very center of Tokyo. Here Father Nicholas established his residence and the center of the Orthodox Church. He began by training well- instructed men and native assistants, for which purpose he had an ordinary college and a school of philosophy and theology; later on he also had a special school for young women. He preached his religion by means of carefully trained catechists and priests. From 1881 he also had a religious review, published twice monthly and a publication committee installed at his house published many books. In 1886 Fr Nicholas was consecrated bishop in Russia and in 1890 he completed the erection of his cathedral. Bishop Nicholas enjoyed a great personal esteem; he founded and governed everything pertaining to his mission. During the Russo-Japanese War the situation was very delicate, but the Christians, at least the greater number of them, did not abandon him. Even during this time he continued all his undertakings unmolested, his house being guarded by Japanese soldiers. Prior to that, he received from the Holy Synod 95,000 yen yearly, but during the Russo-Japanese War, these and other resources from Russia were greatly diminished, while on the other hand the price of everything in Japan increased. The bishop was compelled to diminish his expenses, to dismiss part of his staff and to exhort the Christians to contribute more generously to support their church. After the victories of the Japanese over the Russian armies, the Christians leaders, after having agreed among themselves, declared to Archbishop Nicholas their intention to support themselves, independent of Russia. As Russia has its national church they wished to have also their Japanese National Church. Little has been written concerning the work of the Russians in Japan; even in Russia almost nothing has been published. According to one Protestant reckoning, the Orthodox church numbered 30,166 baptized Christians; according to another only 13,000 (the last figure denotes perhaps practicing members). There were 37 native priests and 139 catechists. Expenses for church and evangelization in 1907 amounted to 55,279 yen; contributions of Christians, 10,711 yen; Churches or places of preaching, 265. Among the Russians, as among Protestants, and everywhere throughout Japan, the tendency was toward independence.From the public domain Catholic Encyclopedia.  Russian Revolution  The site of a former Russian school in Tokyo, now used as commercial space After the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, about 2,000,000 Russian refugees who did not accept the Bolshevik rule entered mostly the United States and Europe. Some of them settled in the Home Islands of Japan. Traditionally these refugees have been known as White Russians, with the corresponding Japanese term being Hakkei- Roshiajin, a term which has been applied to all former residents of the former Russian Empire. Initially the majority of Russians lived in Tokyo and Yokohama. After the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923 a significant number of them moved to Kobe. A white √©migr√© family is depicted in the novel The Makioka Sisters by famed Japanese author Junichiro Tanizaki.  Modern times  As of 2005, the statistics of Japanese government reported 37,000 Russians enter Japan yearly on average, not counting temporary landing permits of seamen and tourists. The number of Russians that stay in Japan longer than 90 days (the maximal duration of a temporary visa in Japan) is about 6,000.

Lake Hodges Bridge is an important part of San Diego's north-south transportation axis. The original bridge was constructed in 1919. The bridge later became integrated into the newly constructed U.S. Route 395. As part of a roadway realignment and improvement project, the original structure was demolished in 1968, and replaced with a new structure in 1969. That bridge was subsequently replaced in 1981, when I-15 was built to supersede US 395. As a traffic bottleneck, the bridge is vulnerable to traffic jams in North San Diego County. The nature of the lake and the surrounding land makes the bridge the singular access into the city of San Diego from inland North County. The only two major ways around the bridge are the Del Dios Highway, a two-lane winding road to Interstate 5 via Del Mar, and the trip through Ramona into Escondido. Although paved access roads through the San Pasqual Valley to the east of Lake Hodges do exist, they are lightly traveled and are not designed to handle heavy traffic. The bridge is thus effectively the only crossing point for drivers on the route. The current bridge is a concrete viaduct. It was widened and replaced in 2006-2009 as part of a project to add managed lanes in the I-15 corridor. Depending on the amount of rainfall in San Diego County, Lake Hodges's water level fluctuates significantly. As such, Lake Hodges Bridge may cross over water or a dry lake bed from time to time. Due to the vast amount of vegetation that springs up when water levels are low, the area below the bridge has been jokingly referred to as \\"Hodges National Forest\\".  Lake Hodges Pedestrian Bridge  The Lake Hodges Pedestrian Bridge, officially named the David Kreitzer Lake Hodges Bicycle Pedestrian Bridge after a retired planning commissioner, is a pedestrian bridge spanning Lake Hodges immediately south of the Interstate 15 span. The bridge was opened to the public on May 15, 2009. The bridge is of a stress-ribbon design, the longest of its type in the world, and only the sixth to have been built in the US. From end to end the bridge measures . This design was chosen for having the least impact on environmentally sensitive habitats in the construction area.

Education and career Born in 1928, in Biloxi, Mississippi, Nixon received a Juris Doctor in 1951 from Tulane University Law School. He entered private practice in Biloxi from 1952 to 1968, interrupted by service in the United States Air Force from 1953 to 1955. Federal judicial service Nixon was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 29, 1968, to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, to a new seat authorized by 80 Stat. 75. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 6, 1968, and received his commission on June 7, 1968. He served as Chief Judge from 1982 to 1989. His service terminated on November 3, 1989, due to his impeachment and conviction. Impeachment Nixon was convicted in 1986 on perjury charges and sentenced to 5 years in prison. The offense stemmed from his grand jury testimony and statements to federal officers concerning his intervention in the state drug prosecution of Drew Fairchild, the son of Wiley Fairchild, a business partner of Nixon. Although the case was assigned to a state court, Wiley Fairchild had asked Nixon to help out by speaking to the prosecutor. Nixon did so, and the prosecutor, a long-time friend, dropped the case. When Nixon was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Department of Justice, he denied any involvement whatsoever. Subsequently, a federal grand jury was empaneled and he again denied his involvement. He was convicted of making false statements to a grand jury. In 1989, he was impeached by the United States House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate, for committing perjury before a grand jury. Upon his conviction by the Senate, he was removed from office. Nixon appealed his impeachment and removal to the United States Supreme Court. In Nixon v.

Along with the competing Tampa Bay Times, the Tampa Tribune was one of two major newspapers published in the Tampa Bay area. The newspaper also published a St. Petersburg Tribune edition, sold and distributed in Pinellas County. It published a Sunday magazine, Florida Accent, during the 1960s and 1970s. The Tampa Tribune also operated Highlands Today, a daily newspaper in Sebring. The Tribune stopped publishing the Hernando Today, which was located in Brooksville, on December 1, 2014, citing \\"a tough newspaper advertising climate.\\" On May 3, 2016, the Tampa Bay Times announced that it had acquired the Tribune, and was combining the Times and Tribunes operations, ending publication of the Tribune.  History  Daily publication of the Tribune started in 1895 when Wallace Stovall upgraded printing from once a week. In 1927, newspaper mogul John Stewart Bryan, of Virginia, and his business partner Samuel Emory Thomason, previously a vice-president with the Chicago Tribune, purchased The Tampa Tribune for $900,000. \\"1927 John Stewart Bryan purchased The Tampa Tribune in partnership with Samuel Emory Thomason.\\" The Tampa Tribune Publishing company grew to include the Tampa Tribune, the Tampa Times, TBO.com, TampaBayOnline.com, WFLA radio, and WFLA-TV. In 1966, the Tampa Tribune, along with sister properties WFLA-AM-FM-TV, was purchased by Richmond Newspapers, becoming Media General in 1969. Since 2000, the Tribune partnered with WFLA-TV and TBO.com in a converged arrangement, all connected with one another under owner Media General. The large media complex is located on Parker Street in Downtown Tampa. The Tribune was a flagship newspaper under the Media General banner until it was sold in 2012. Executive editor Janet Coats left the paper in December 2009 and was not replaced until May 17, 2012, when managing editor Richard \\"Duke\\" Maas was promoted to executive editor. On May 17, 2012, it was announced that investment company Berkshire Hathaway would be acquiring Media General's newspaper division; the purchase did not include the Tribune or its associated regional papers, which were being retained by Media General. No reason was given as to why Media General was retaining the Tribune, but there was speculation that the paper would be sold to another party, such as Halifax Media Group (which owns several papers in Florida) or a completely different owner, or that the paper would merge with the Tampa Bay Times. In October 2012, The Tampa Tribune and its associated print and digital products were acquired by Tampa Media Group, Inc., a new company formed by Revolution Capital Group. On May 3, 2016, the Tampa Bay Times announced that it had acquired the Tribune, and was combining the Times and Tribunes operations, ending publication of the Tribune. The acquisition also includes Highlands Today, weekly newspaper The Suncoast News, and weekly Spanish-language newspaper Centro; all of these will continue publishing under Times' ownership. The Tampa Tribune name will be repurposed as a neighborhood news section of the Times.  Tampa Daily Times trademark  In 1958, the Tribune acquired Tampa's struggling evening newspaper, the Tampa Daily Times. The Tribune published the paper as The Tampa Times until 1982. From then until the Tribune closed down, the Tribune displayed the logo for The Tampa Times in the masthead on the front section. This was part of an effort by the Tribune to keep its trademark on the Tampa Times name, and to avoid confusion with the then-St. Petersburg Times, which long published a Tampa edition. In 2006, it was decided in a lawsuit that the Tribune could keep its exclusive use of the Tampa Times name, but only for five years. This exclusivity ended at the end of 2011, allowing the St. Petersburg Times to rename itself the Tampa Bay Times, effective January 1, 2012. The decision did not restrict the use of The Tampa Times name by the Tribune after the expiration of exclusivity.

The major fires of Chicago in 1871 caused significant further quantities of Greek immigrants to move to the area, inspired by the prospect of rebuilding the town of Chicago. The original Greektown precinct on Halsted Street began with the Jane Addams Hull House, which acted as a meeting point for the Greek population within Chicago and provided a basis for community to be built from 1889. This house was used as a hub for the Greek community, and saw further small business expand within this area, despite small numbers, with 245 Greek people reported as living in Chicago, who were noted as predominantly young men of lower socio-economic background. This saw a slow expansion of restaurants, and various other stores throughout the century, with the Chicago tribune reporting in 1895 that ‚Äòthe Greeks have almost run the Italians out of the fruit business in Chicago not only on a small retail way, but as wholesalers as well‚Äô. Attempts to unite the various Greek restaurants in the area as well as the wider city were made with the establishment of ‚ÄòHermes‚Äô, a Greek business group in 1910. This group initially failed to gain traction amongst business owners. In the longer term, however, it united the Greek community, writing bylaws for its member businesses and organising social events, laying the framework for current regulatory bodies such as the Greektown organisation. By 1930, the area which had become known as the ‚ÄòGreek Delta‚Äô, held a foreign and native-born population of over 30,000. This population continued its growth and expansion with the precinct growing in size and area. This continued until 1960, when the opening of the University of Illinois Chicago campus, as well as the construction and opening of the Eisenhower Expressway, forced the precinct to move North along Halsted street to its location between Van Buren and Madison streets. The majority of functioning organisations and restaurants operating within the Greektown precinct opened within the 1970-1990 period following relocation to the precinct‚Äôs space between Van Buren and Madison streets. The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 saw bars and restaurants within the precinct close for business and events either postponed or cancelled due to public-health related Illinois state laws. Flaming Saganaki was invented at the Parthenon Restaurant in Chicago's Greektown.http://chicago.eater.com/2016/9/7/12835928/parthenon-chicago-greek- closed-flaming-cheese-opahttp://abc7chicago.com/food/parthenon-restaurant- closes-after-48-years-in-greektown/1502411/ Transportation Greektown is easily accessible via public transportation by riding the Chicago \\"L\\"'s Blue Line to the UIC-Halsted station and heading north, or via the #8 Halsted bus route.  Events  There are various events occurring in the Greektown precinct, varying in scale from weekly to annually. ‚ÄòA Taste of Greektown‚Äô is an annual culinary and cultural event held within the Greektown precinct, held in the month of August. The stated aim of the festival is to combine ‚Äòold world traditions with 21st century freshness‚Äô in the Greek cuisine, through the use of local neighbourhood food producers and vendors. The event additionally offers entertainment through Greek bands and entertainment, as well as games for children. This event Is held between Adams Street and Van Buren street on 315 South Halsted street. This event saw the 30th anniversary of its founding occur in 2019. The Greektown precinct organisation also offer various events which occur on a more regular basis, such as monthly Greek dancing classes. Many events scheduled for early 2020, however, such as the ‚Äò12th District CAPS meeting‚Äô for citizens to raise queries and concerns with local police, were either cancelled or postponed due to restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.  Cultural Sites  The prominent cultural site within the Greektown precinct is the National Hellenic Museum, situated on 333 South Halsted street. This museum was established initially in 1983, with its new facility on Halsted street officially opened in 2011. The museum states its purpose as depicting and upholding the legacy of Greek culture within the United States through education. In its depiction of the Greek experience and legacy within the united states, the museum utilises over 20,000 resources. These include texts, artefacts, photographs and newspapers, as well as over 400 recorded accounts. The museum receives regular visits organised through the ‚ÄòOffice of Tourism‚Äôs Chicago Neighbourhoods‚Äô program, as well as over 10,000 public school students from Chicago every year. The museum regularly updates and introduces exhibits, such as the ‚ÄòReaching for the American Dream: The Greek Story in America‚Äô exhibit, gifted by Angela G Paterakis. This exhibit, through utilising firsthand accounts, photographs and artefacts, traces the story of Hellenic culture and its integration into the USA through involvement in major historical events, and establishing businesses and communities. The museum has also taken over exhibits from other museums, such as the Cyprus Museum of Jackson Florida‚Äôs entire collection, which included artefacts numbering over 300.  Strategic Plan  The strategic plan for the Greektown precinct is a document outlining the intended future plan of business operations for the Greektown precinct, compiled by the Lakota group. This process began on December 1, 2017 with surveys, interviews and reviews amongst local businesses and stakeholders. This was followed by more canvassing and stakeholder consultancy, with the final Strategic plan published in March 2019. The overarching purpose behind this plans publication is to outline a clear path for continued economic sustenance for the Greektown district, whilst ensuring that its heritage and cultural significance for the Greek community is not diminished. It is a 123-page document, outlining intentions to ‚Äòenhance Greektown as a compelling cultural destination‚Äô, a ‚Äòvibrant business district‚Äô and as a ‚Äòprosperous and collaborative neighbourhood‚Äô. The report also states its intended methods to achieve these goals, including storefront and fa√ßade decoration enhancements, as well as prioritising various ‚Äòaction items‚Äô in order to increase public engagement with the precinct, such as the introduction of a year long calendar, detailing planned events and promotions within the precinct. These activities have been designed whilst considering the propensity for property ownership and prices, as well as zoning to change in the future.

Video game levels generally have progressively increasing difficulty to appeal to players with different skill levels. Each level presents new content and challenges to keep player's interest high. In games with linear progression, levels are areas of a larger world, such as Green Hill Zone. Games may also feature interconnected levels, representing locations. Although the challenge in a game is often to defeat some sort of character, levels are sometimes designed with a movement challenge, such as a jumping puzzle, a form of obstacle course. Players must judge the distance between platforms or ledges and safely jump between them to reach the next area. These puzzles can slow the momentum down for players of fast action games; the first Half-Lifes penultimate chapter, \\"Interloper\\", featured multiple moving platforms high in the air with enemies firing at the player from all sides. Level design Level design, or environment design,Oxland 2004, pp.21-22,126 is a discipline of game development involving creation of video game levels--locales, stages, or missions.Bates 2004, p.107Brathwaite, Schreiber 2009, p.5Shahrani 2006, part I This is commonly done using a level editor, a game development software designed for building levels; however, some games feature built-in level editing tools. Edge (video game) level layout.pngLayout of a level in the puzzle game Edge Dromfaret levels.jpgDifferent levels in a 2D computer graphics game layout Nexuiz screenshot 05.jpgIn games with 3D computer graphics like Nexuiz, the levels are designed as three-dimensional spaces = History = In early days of video games, a single programmer would create the maps and layouts for a game, and a discipline or profession dedicated solely to level design did not exist.Bates 2004, p.162, \\"A few years ago, [level designer] position didn't exist. .. Now it's a key position on many teams.\\" Early games often featured a level system of ascending difficulty as opposed to progression of story-line. The first game genre that required significant amounts of time to design areas were text-based games,Shahrani 2006, part III such as MUDs. Often, promoted users were assigned to create new paths, new rooms, new equipment, and new actions, often using the game interface itself. 1983's Lode Runner was one of the first titles to ship with a level editor, and its designer, Doug Smith, reputedly paid neighborhood children to design levels for the game. That same year the multiplayer dungeon crawl Dandy was released, and it also shipped with a level editor which was documented in the manual. ZZT (1991) is a later game with user-accessible mapping and scripting. Doom (1993) and Doom II (1994) were two of the first games to attract focused game modding activity, and many WAD level files were made for them. One of the reasons was a clear separation between the level files and game engine itself. Half-Life, Quake 3, and many other games have notable mapping tools and communities focusing on user-generated content. = Process = Level design for each individual level in a modern game typically starts with concept art, sketches, renderings, and physical models.Bates 2004, p.107-110Oxland 2004, pp.132-135 Once completed, these concepts transform into extensive documentation, environment modeling, and the placing of game specific entities (actors), usually with the aid of a level editor. A level editor may be distributed as a complete stand-alone package, at times, rivaling commercial 3D modelling software. There are various steps involved in laying out a map and these steps may vary dramatically across the many different game genres that exist today. General steps include: * Laying out the large-scale features of the map, such as hills, cities, rooms, tunnels, etc., for players and enemies to move around in;Oxland 2004, pp.128-130 * Determining environmental conditions and \\"ground rules\\" such as day/night, weather, scoring systems, allowable weapons or gameplay types, time limits, and starting resources. * Specifying certain regions where certain gameplay activities or behaviors occur, such as resource harvesting, base building, water travelling, etc.; * Specifying non-static parts of a level, such as doors, keys and buttons with associated mechanisms, teleporters, hidden passageways, etc.; * Specifying locations of various entities, such as player units, enemies, monster spawn points, ladders, coins, resource nodes, weapons, save points,Oxland 2004, p.139 etc.; * Specifying the start and exit locations for one or more players; * Adding aesthetic details such as level-specific graphic textures, sounds, animation, lighting and music; * Introducing scripted event locations, where certain actions by the player can trigger specified changes; * Placing pathfinding nodes that non- player characters take as they walk around, the actions they will take in response to specific triggers, and any dialog they might have with the player. The first level of the game usually designed to get players to explore the mechanics of the game, notably in World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. Cut scenes may be triggered by events in a level, but require distinctly different skills, and may be created by a different person or team. The Level Design Process may be iterated several times before achieving the desired outcome. Level designers and/or concept artists may also be required to provide a pre- rendered map of the level (or entire game world) for the player.Oxland 2004, pp.140-141 = Design goals = Level design is necessary for two primary purposes - providing players with a goalBates 2004, pp.111-112 and providing players with enjoyable play experience. Good level design strives to produce quality gameplay, provide an immersive experience, and sometimes, especially in story-based games, to advance the storyline. Skilled use of textures and audio is necessary to produce immersive player experience. = Player directing = Levels are generally constructed with flow control in mind,Bates 2004, pp.113-114 that is directing the player towards the goal of the level and preventing confusion and idling. This can be accomplished by various means. Often the level layouts features power-ups and items aligned in path and combinations that collecting them inevitably progresses the game and advances the story-line. This is one of the basic player direction technique and is most often seen in platformers. Lighting and illumination, as well as distinctly coloured objects are often used to unambiguously steer the player towards the correct path. Similarly, clearly marked choke-points can be introduced. Another method is strategic placement of obstacles and aesthetic environment props, that direct the player's attention to \\"clear\\" paths instead. This is often used in closed, \\"stuffed\\" environments. Levels may be designed to force the players to explore the map and advance. Most RTS maps give each player a starting base, but will have resource distribution and terrain features designed to draw players out of their base and engage each other. Teamplay maps can provide noticeable advantages to one team over another, when designed poorly.  Level designer  A level designer is a game designer who creates environments and scenarios using a level editor and other tools.Moore, Novak 2010, p.76 Level designers will usually work on a level from pre-production to completion; working with both incomplete and complete versions of the game. Video game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use. This eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code. As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community, level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for level consistency and clear layout before required artwork is produced by game artists. Many level designers have skills as both a visual artist and game designers,Bates 2004, p.118 although in recent years the responsibility for visual, structural and gameplay related tasks has been increasingly divided among several specialists.  Level creation tools  A wide variety of tools may be used by someone designing and creating a level. Although it is faster to design models and textures with general purpose multimedia creation tools, games usually require the data to be in a unique format suited for that game's engine. For this, specific compilers and converters of models, textures, and audio data may be required to lay out a level. Sometimes, professional 3D editing software, such as 3D Studio Max, Blender, AutoCAD, Lightwave, Maya, Softimage XSI or Grome is used, usually customized with a special plugin developed for the specific game. = Level editor = A level editor (also known as a map, campaign or scenario editor) is a game development tool used to design levels, maps, campaigns and virtual worlds for a video game. An individual involved with the creation of game levels is a level designer or mapper. In some cases, the creator of a video game includes built-in level editing tools, for example, a track editor for a racing game. Other times they may release an official level editor for the game as a separate application. Sometimes players of the game create fan-made level editors. One of the first 3D games which became popular partially due to level editors and fan-made content was Doom. The creation of various third- party editors led to the birth of an online community trading fan-made maps. A level editor is often limited to creating levels for only a certain game engine. Developing a level editor takes a lot of time and it is more time and cost efficient to release multiple games using the same engine instead of developing a new engine and level editor for each game. Level editors offer some limited scope of content creation, but in the case of gaming industry solutions the scope is very large allowing an entire game to be created without the need for much support from a programming team. To make larger changes to a game than simply adding new levels, a software development kit (SDK) is sometimes needed. Image:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 2.jpgthumb256pxThe level editor of Warzone 2100. File:Warzone 2100 - EditWorld - 1.jpgthumb350pxA level editor in the strategy game Warzone 2100 File:Battle for wesnoth map editor screenshot.jpgthumbrightExample map editor for The Battle for Wesnoth. = Construction set = In the early years of video-gaming, some games came with a utility called a \\"construction set\\". This was similar in many ways to a level-editor. Some games used them to create extra levels, whereas others (like the Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit) used them as a means to create a game rather than be a game in itself.  Tutorial  In the context of video game design, a tutorial is a video game level that teaches players the rules and controls of the game. Some tutorials are integrated into the game itself, while others are completely separate and optional. Games can have both of these at once, offering a basic mandatory tutorial and optional advanced training. Tutorials have become increasingly common due to the decline of printed video game manuals as a result of cost cutting and digital distribution. Tutorials can be important since they are a player's first impression of a game, and an overly tedious tutorial or one that does not allow for player freedom can negatively affect their view of a game. However, the lack of a tutorial can also harm a game by causing the player to become frustrated, since they cannot figure out essential game mechanics. = Types of tutorials = Tutorials range from gently easing the player into the experience, to forcing them to learn via trial and error, only allowing them to proceed when they have mastered the gameplay. The former type is often framed as guidance from a mentor character, such as a wise old man or elderly master, and sometimes even literally depicts the main character growing from a child into an adult as they learn their skills, as in Horizon Zero Dawn. The latter type of tutorial presents the player with increasingly difficult enemies that demonstrate techniques required to overcome them. Other types of tutorials include slowly giving players information over the course of the entire game, as in the Legend of Zelda series. Yet other games break the fourth wall with their tutorials or parody them, using them as a source of comedy. Examples include Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, in which the main character demonstrates his annoyance at being forced to undergo a tutorial, and Undertale, in which the motherly Toriel dotes on the player character so much that she literally holds their hand through dangerous puzzles instead of allowing the player to solve them. = Criticism = Some critics believe that a good tutorial should necessarily allow the player to discover game mechanics for themselves without being told how to do them, as in the original Metroid, as well as Minecraft.  Gameplay alteration  Maps' design can significantly impact the gameplay. For example, the gameplay may be shifted towards a platformer (by careful placement of platforms) or a puzzle gameBates 2004, pp.116Brathwaite, Schreiber 2009, p.48 (by extensive use of buttons, keys, and doors). Some FPS maps may be designed to prevent sniping by not including any long hallways, while other maps may allow for a mix of sniping and closer combat. Gimmick maps are sometimes created to explore selected features of gameplay, such as sniping or fist fighting.Bates 2004, p.108 While they are briefly useful to level designers and interesting to experienced players, they are usually not included in final list of levels of the game because of their limited replay value. = Minigame = A minigame (also spelled mini-game or mini game, sometimes called a subgame or microgame) is a short video game often contained within another video game, and sometimes in application software or on a display of any form of hardware. A minigame contains different gameplay elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be bonus stages or secret levels. They are distinguishable from levels in that a level is an environment bound to a set of mechanics and rules that all defines all other normal levels in a game, whereas a minigame can use different rules and playstyles but may not necessarily be set in a different environment. = Hidden features = Level designers sometimes create hidden rooms and areas that usually require more effort for the player to reach or to notice.Shahrani 2006, part II These usually give some additional rewards, such as ammo or powerups. Casual players usually do not discover these, but these areas are interesting enough to be discovered and documented by dedicated gamers. Sometimes, they serve as easter eggs, containing messages such as the level designers' names or pictures, or political or humorous messages. One of the first games with a 3D engine to feature hidden features was Wolfenstein 3D, where certain walls could be \\"pushed\\" to reveal hidden passages. For example, Quake has many secret areas that reward the player with ammo, weapons, quad damage powerups, and in one hard-to-reach secret area, Dopefish makes an appearance. In fact, the hardest difficulty level, titled \\"Nightmare\\", is only reachable through a secret portal in the fourth dimension's entrance hall. Sometimes, a whole level may be designed as a secret level. = Bonus stage = A bonus stage (also known as a bonus level or bonus round) is a special level within a video game designed to reward the player or players, and typically allows the player to collect extra points or power-ups. Bonus stage either have no enemies or hazards, or replace the normal penalties for being struck by enemies or hazards with simply being thrown out of the bonus stage. Many bonus stages need to be activated or discovered in some manner, or certain conditions must be satisfied to access them. Otherwise, they appear after the player has completed a certain number of regular stages.  Level bugs  There are many map bugs that level designers try to avoid, but sometimes go unnoticed for some time. A player might get stuck in map geometry with no way to escape or to die. A player might be able to find a specific spot where they do not have to move to gain experience, because monsters are constantly spawned but can be easily and immediately killed. In multiplayer maps, a player may be able to reach areas of the map designed to be inaccessible, for example, reaching an advantageous rooftop position and camping other players. In the worst case, a player might be able to fall out-of-bounds of a map where other players cannot reach them. Invisible walls are cited to be level design bugs, and might be \\"left-over geometry\\" from an earlier version of the level or an object's improperly aligned \\"collision box\\". In some cases, specific mapping tools can be designed to automatically detect problems such as falling \\"outside\\" a level, and reaching \\"stuck\\" areas. Careful level designers run these tools as the last step before releasing a new version of a level.Bates 2004, pp.117-118 In most cases, the best way to improve a map is by playtesting it with experienced players, and allowing them to try to exploit any problems.

It was adapted into a film in 1939. While teaching music at Knickerbocker University, Phil \\"Junior\\" Dolan III tries to persuade Sergei Alexandrovich, the director of the Russian Ballet, to stage the jazz ballet Slaughter on Tenth Avenue. After becoming involved with the company's prima ballerina Vera Barnova, Junior is forced to assume the male lead in Slaughter. Trouble ensues when he becomes the target of two thugs hired by Vera's lover and dance partner to kill him. On Your Toes marked the first time a Broadway musical made dramatic use of classical dance and incorporated jazz into its score. Background On Your Toes originally was conceived as a film, and as a vehicle for Fred Astaire. His refusal of the part, because he thought that the role clashed with his debonair image developed in his contemporary films, caused it to be presented initially as a stage production. Richard Rodgers wrote: \\"Astaire at that point in his career was a pretty chic fellow who usually wore white ties and tails, and the producers felt that there was no chance in our script for him to appear that way.\\"Writer's Notes, Richard Rodgers R&H;, accessed May 19, 2009Grimmond, Peter.

Eddie Albert, not known as a dancer in his career, gave a remarkable performance opposite Vera Zorina in the 1939 film.On Your Toes imdb.com, accessed June 3, 2016 Productions The first Broadway production, directed by C. Worthington Miner and choreographed by George Balanchine, opened on April 11, 1936, at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for seven months, then transferred to the Majestic, for a total run of 315 performances. The cast included Ray Bolger, Tamara Geva, and Monty Woolley. The London West End production opened on 5 February 1937, at the Palace Theatre, with Jack Whiting and Vera Zorina as the dancers. The first Broadway revival, directed by Abbott and choreographed by Balanchine, opened on October 11, 1954 at the 46th Street Theatre, where it ran for 64 performances. The cast included Vera Zorina, Bobby Van, Elaine Stritch, and David Winters. The original score was embellished with \\"You Took Advantage of Me.\\" The second revival, directed by Abbott and choreographed by Donald Saddler, started in 1982 with national previews. One of the original cast members, Natalia Makarova, was injured during the preview at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Valentina Kozlova filled in the role, and Leonid Kozlov, her former husband, replaced George de la Pe√±a to complete the previews.Natalia Makarova to Return to 'Toes', The New York Times, February 1, 1983, accessed May 2, 2009 After seven previews, the revival opened on March 6, 1983 at the Virginia Theatre with the original cast, where it ran for 505 performances. The cast included Natalia Makarova, Christine Andreas, George de la Pe√±a, George S. Irving, Dina Merrill, Philip Arthur Ross, Betty Ann Grove and Lara Teeter.On Your Toes, IBDB - Internet Broadway Database, accessed May 2, 2009 Synopsis ;Act I On a vaudeville stage, Phil Dolan II, his wife Lili, and his son Junior perform their nightly routine, but afterwards in the dressing- room, the parents tell Junior that he must go to school. Fifteen years later, as predicted, Junior is a music teacher at Knickerbocker University. He has two talented students: Sidney Cohn and Frankie Frayne. Sidney has written a promising jazz ballet which Frankie catches Junior dancing to alone in the classroom (uncovering his \\"secret past\\"), and she trades an introduction to the Russian Ballet's manager in return for his listening to her song. In the apartment of Vera Baranova, star of the Russian Ballet, Peggy, the manager, enthusiastically tells Sergei, the company's director, about the new jazz ballet. He is not interested in anything new - he doesn't even recognise that the Revolution has happened! Junior arrives as Vera and co-star/unfaithful lover Morrisone are having a Russian screaming match. The others leave, so that Vera and Junior can discuss the new ballet, but that leads to a new entanglement. Back in the classroom, Frankie is jealous of Junior's stories about Vera and the Russians (Peggy has promised him a chance to dance in the corps de ballet), and they both wish they were away from it all. At the opening of the ballet, La Princesse Zenobia, Junior is told that one of the dancers is in jail and he must take his place, but onstage he gets all his steps, rhythms and positions cock-eyed and makes a laughing-stock of the ballet. But the audience loves it, nevertheless. ;Act II Sergei, Peggy, Vera, Morrosine and Junior have listened to the jazz ballet. Opinions are mixed, and Vera and Morrosine are still arguing, as he becomes increasingly jealous of Junior. Poor Junior has got love problems, too: he upsets Frankie by going to lunch with Vera (for business reasons) instead of her, but she is \\"Glad to Be Unhappy\\". Then Peggy, Sergei, and some of the company visit Junior's school. Sergei has come to break the bad news that he will not be doing the jazz ballet, but Peggy persuades him by threatening to pull out the million dollars she has put into the company. After Sergei's announcement that the next production will be Slaughter on Tenth Avenue, the class stages the title number \\"On Your Toes\\", in which the students' jazz and the company's classical routines are deftly combined. At a rehearsal, Morrosine's jealousy of Junior escalates, he fights with Sergei and is knocked‚Äìout, suddenly making Junior the new star. The humiliated Morrosine plots with his gangster friend, Louie, to shoot Junior at the end of the performance. Joe, the stage doorman, overhears and warns Frankie. On-stage, Junior is tipped‚Äìoff and signals to the conductor to avoid the final loud climax which would cover the shot, so he keeps the orchestra playing the last few bars of the music over and over as Junior dances frantically to keep the shooter from firing until the police arrest him. After the curtain call, Frankie embraces Junior and is startled to see his parents waiting to congratulate him. The music-teacher has made it back to his home-ground - the stage.

The film stars ballerina Vera Zorina (billed as Zorina), Eddie Albert, Alan Hale and Frank McHugh, and features Leonid Kinskey, Gloria Dickson, James Gleason, Erik Rhodes, Berton Churchill and Donald O'Connor. Although some of the songs from the Broadway score were used as background music, the film does not have any singing in it. The Slaughter on Tenth Avenue ballet does appear at the end of the film, with choreography by George Balanchine, one of eight films for which he created the dances. Eddie Albert's character dances the lead in the ballet, opposite Zorina. According to John Reid, \\"Albert is no dancer...But with the aid of a visual double for one or two shots plus post- synched taps, he actually manages rather well, and even duets with the great Zorina with reasonable facility.\\"Reid, John.

Life Idelette de Bure came from Flanders and first married John Stordeur from Li√®ge. At some stage they moved to Strassburg where they were recorded as being Anabaptists. Idelette and John Stordeur had two children (Charles, Judith) before Stordeur died after a brief illness, leaving Idelette a widow. Calvin was so caught up in his labors that he did not seem to consider marriage until age 30 or so. He asked friends to help him find a woman who was \\"chaste, obliging, not fastidious, economical, patient, and careful for (his) health\\". His fellow laborer Martin Bucer had known Idelette and recommended her to Calvin in confidence that she would fit the bill. They married in August 1540. Idelette bore Calvin one son and possibly a few daughters, all of whom died in infancy. In response to the slander of Catholics who took this for a judgment upon them for being heretics, Calvin said he was content with his many sons in the faith. Idelette busied herself attending to Calvin in his many illnesses, faithfully visiting the sick and afflicted, and making her home a refuge for those who fled for their lives and their faith. Though she survived the plague when it ravaged Geneva, Idelette died after a lengthy illness in 1549. Upon her deathbed she was patient, and her words, edifying, e.g.: \\"Oh God of Abraham, and of all our fathers, in thee have the faithful trusted during so many past ages, and none of them have trusted in vain. I also will hope\\".

Design and development The LWS-2 was designed as a light ambulance aircraft, for a requirement of the Polish Air Force and the Polish Red Cross (PCK), which was operating military ambulances. A preliminary design was made in 1936 by Zbys≈Çaw Cio≈Çkosz, the main designer of the LWS factory, a detailed design - by Jerzy Teisseyre. It was influenced by RWD-9 and RWD-13 planes of the RWD team, especially their wing construction with rich wing mechanization, that gave it STOL capabilities. The prototype was built using PCK funds. Aircraft was registered SP-ATP and flown in autumn of 1937. The Polish Red Cross ordered six aircraft, but the LWS factory was busy at that time with military production (RWD-14 Czapla and LWS-3 Mewa), and they were not built by the outbreak of World War II. LWS's next design, the LWS-3 Mewa close reconnaissance plane, utilized many features of the LWS-2, and was generally similar. =Description= Mixed construction (steel and wood) braced high- wing monoplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage of a steel frame, canvas covered (engine part with duralumin). Two-spar straight wings of wooden construction, with slats, flaps and flaperons, covered with canvas and plywood (in front), rectangular with rounded tips and narrowing near the fuselage. The wings were supported with V-struts and were folding rearwards. Cantilever empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators). Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. Capacity of four in a closed cockpit: a pilot in front, a doctor behind him, and two lying on stretchers at the back. It had a 9-cylinder air-cooled Avia-built Wright Whirlwind J-5 radial engine delivering 220 hp (164 kW) nominal power and 240 hp (179 kW) take-off power. Two-blade metal propeller Ratier, of variable pitch. A 130-liter fuel tank behind the engine. Cruise fuel consumption 48 l/h. Operational history On May 19, 1938 the prototype was given to the Air Force. Between July 1 and July 4, 1938, the LWS-2 prototype took part in an International Ambulance Aircraft Contest in Esch in Luxembourg, and won first place and a cup for the best accommodation in a cab for the injured. The prototype was later used by the Polish Red Cross. Its fate during the World War II is not clear, as the damaged plane was captured by the Germans on airfield at Krosno.

This was evident in their second and third singles, and released in mid-2003. Both singles focused on rap rather than pop. The latter song attracted attention from Western audiences when it appeared on Adam and Joe Go Tokyo. Halcali with DJ Kimjun performing at Anime Central in Chicago, May 16, 2008  Image  = The new style = In winter 2003, Halcali released their fourth single, the Christmas-themed . This single continued to show the fluctuation between rap and J-pop. After the release of \\"Strawberry Chips\\", Halcali's visual style shifted, along with the layout and lyrical style of their songs. Their fifth single, , was the first to showcase this new style. This change in style is attributed to Halcali's coming-of-age, however it also represents the changing of fads that occurred in Japanese teens at the time and was necessary to retain their fanbase. Their sixth single, \\"Baby Blue!\\", was an instant cult hit. The album art and video featured the character Hanpanda, a trend by Japanese artist Nagi Noda, which has since become popular. = Haruka = , portrays herself to be the more mature of the pair in her PR and personal blog entries. She shows focus for performances, commentating seriously on those commenting on her in TV appearances. She has recently become more focused on fashion, and has appeared in Barfout, a fashion magazine, along with Yucali. = Yukari = In the past, would portray a childlike image, which gave the group's image a more school- aged look. She wore a tilted baseball cap or some other sort of head apparel as was the fad at the time. Her current image is now more adult-like.  Progression and fourth album  Halcali's sound has been progressively and markedly different from their period of inception- initially being focused upon peppy, high-energy beats with equally fast and furious lyrics, moving onto more creative songs which seem to weave between genres and sounds, a la Èü≥Ê®Ç„Éé„Çπ„Çπ„É° (Ongaku no Susume), and more particularly „Çµ„Ç§„Éú„Éº„Ç∞‰ø∫ÈÅî (Cyborg Oretachi), which included musical genres ranging from rap, pop, electrocore and rock. As Haruka & Yukari have matured, they have taken on the role of writing their own rhymes and lyrics and composing their own music. Their third album, „Çµ„Ç§„Éú„Éº„Ç∞‰ø∫ÈÅî (Cyborg Oretachi), featured many tracks which were written or co-written by Halcali. Every single after this album has also been written by or co-written by Halcali as well.

The first storm of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season, Adrian developed on May 17, just two days after the official start of the season, several hundred miles south-southeast of Mexico. Tracking in an atypical northwestward direction, the storm gradually intensified. On May 19, the storm reached its peak strength as a minimal hurricane with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Not long after reaching this intensity, the storm abruptly weakened. By the morning of May 20, the system had weakened to a minimal tropical storm and turned due west. Later that day, the storm made landfall along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras before dissipating several hours later. Meteorological history Hurricane Adrian originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands in early May 2005. Between May 10 and 14, several areas of disturbed weather moved across Central America, contributing to the development of a broad area of low pressure about 520 mi (835 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. On May 15, another tropical wave interacted with the low, resulting in the consolidation of the system. The following day, the developing low was nearly stationary as convection increased. Around 11:00 am PDT (1800 UTC) on May 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression, the first of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. Upon forming, the depression was situated just south of 10¬∞N, making it the 40th known tropical cyclone to do so since 1949.Tropical cyclone records in the Eastern Pacific are available as far back as 1949. Unlike most storms in the eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression One-E tracked towards the northwest in response to a trough over Mexico. Tropical cyclone forecast models at the time anticipated intensification as conditions ahead of the system favored tropical cyclone development. Initially, the system moved at a slow pace of ; however this later increased to . Within six hours of being declared a depression, the cyclone was classified as Tropical Storm Adrian. Over the following days, gradual strengthening took place as Adrian moved through a region of moderate wind shear. By May 18, deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and feeder bands developed along the periphery of the storm. Warm waters, around , ahead of the storm would allow for further strengthening despite wind shear and interaction with the high terrain of Central America. Additionally, some forecasts predicted that Adrian would survive the passage of Central America and enter the Caribbean Sea, possibly becoming the third known storm to cross from the eastern Pacific into the Atlantic basin. By May 19, the storm became relatively disorganized and Adrian only maintained a small area of convection around its center. However, within hours of this disorganization, the system rapidly consolidated and satellite imagery depicted the precursor to an eye forming. Following this, Adrian intensified to a minimal hurricane before attaining its peak intensity around 10:00 am PDT (1700 UTC) on May 19\\\\. At this time, the storm was situated about 85 mi (140 km) and had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 982 mbar (hPa; 29 inHg). Not long after becoming a hurricane, Adrian suddenly succumbed to persistent wind shear off the coast of El Salvador. Operationally, this weakening was not noticed by the NHC, leading to their assessment of the storm making landfall in El Salvador around 11:00 pm PDT (0600 UTC on May 20) as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. In post-storm analysis, it was determined that the center of Adrian never actually crossed the coastline of El Salvador. Rather, convection associated with the system was sheared northward away from the center of circulation. Meteorologists at the NHC stated that Adrian's near-parallel track along the coast of El Salvador contributed to its rapid weakening as well as keeping the low offshore. Later on May 20, the system weakened to a tropical depression and made landfall in Honduras, along the Gulf of Fonseca, around 1:00 pm PDT (2100 UTC) with winds of 25 mph (35 km/h). Several hours later, Adrian dissipated over the mountains of Central America. Preparations Tropical Depression Adrian several hours before landfall in Honduras on May 20 In response to the approaching hurricane, officials in El Salvador initiated the evacuations of about 3,500 families throughout 13 municipalities. Public facilities, as precautionary measures, were closed. The local governments and citizens were mindful of the damages caused to the region by other hurricanes, namely the 9,000 deaths caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. According to President Antonio Saca, roughly 23,000 people evacuated by the storm's arrival. In fears of significant damage, a state of emergency was declared for the entire country, home to roughly 6.5 million people. In nearby Honduras, officials closed schools and public workers were given a half day as a precautionary measure. Small-scale evacuations also took place in parts of Guatemala and Nicaragua. Guatemala also declared a state of maximum alert as heavy rains from Adrian were expected to trigger flooding. Shelters were set up across the country to house roughly 400,000 people at-risk from the storm. Impact Adrian had minor effects in Honduras; only a few poorly constructed building were destroyed and minor floods were reported and there were no known fatalities associated with the storm. In El Salvador, rains from Adrian led to numerous landslides and flash floods, mainly along coastal areas. Fallen trees were reported throughout the country. The floods prompted officials to shut down roads to keep people out of harm's way. Heavy rains up to 16.4 inches (418.6 mm) caused several landslides that damaged roads. Two deaths took place, one due to a plane crash caused by strong winds, the other caused by flooding. In all, damages in El Salvador totaled to $12 million (2005 USD; $ USD). In Guatemala, two people were killed after rains ahead of Adrian caused a ditch to cave in on them. One person was killed due to flooding in Nicaragua.

He represented Pennsylvania from 1777 to 1779 in the Continental Congress. Roberdeau served as a brigadier general in the Pennsylvania state militia during the war. He was a signer of the Articles of Confederation. Family and early life Roberdeau was born in 1727 on the Island of St. Christopher in the West Indies. His father was a Huguenot immigrant named Isaac Roberdeau; his mother, a Scot, Mary Cunningham. After the death of his father, he immigrated to Philadelphia with his mother and sisters. Roberdeau became a timber merchant. Early service Roberdeau was active in establishing Freemasonry in Philadelphia, which brought him to the attention of Benjamin Franklin and other civic leaders. He served on the Board of Managers for Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia in 1756-1757. He was elected to the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly, serving from 1756 to 1760, but then declined further service. Revolutionary War service When war neared, he joined the Associators (as the Pennsylvania rebel militia was known), and was made colonel of his regiment. In May 1776 he presided at several public meetings calling for the existing Pennsylvania delegation to the Continental Congress to be replaced with members who supported a Declaration of Independence. As a result, he was named to the Committee of Safety, and on July 4, 1776 was named a brigadier general in the state militia. Congressional service Roberdeau was first elected to the Continental Congress in February 1777 and served there until 1779. Later that year, when the Continental Army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge, he worked with General Washington to set up a militia support network known as the Flying Camp, and served as its commander. In April 1778, Roberdeau took a short leave from Congress. He had noted the shortage of powder and shot in the army, and used the time off to establish a lead mine in Bedford County. To protect the mine and camp from Indian attacks, he built a palisade, Fort Roberdeau, at his own expense. Historically, Roberdeau's fort was known as the \\"Lead Mine Fort\\". It has been reconstructed near its original site in Sinking Valley, near present-day Altoona, Blair County, Pennsylvania. After the war he moved to Alexandria, Virginia, and eventually settled in Winchester, where he died in 1795. He is buried in the Mt. Hebron Cemetery there. Genealogy of the Roberdeau Family His son, Isaac Roberdeau, became a civil engineer and U.S. Army officer, who helped Pierre L'Enfant lay out the plan for Washington, D.C..

In November 2016, the school announced that her contract had been extended to 2022, which will make her the longest- serving president in the history of the University of Pennsylvania. In 2018, Fortune magazine named Gutmann one of the \\"World's 50 Greatest Leaders\\". She previously worked at Princeton as provost and Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics. While there, she founded Princeton's ethics center, the University Center for Human Values. Her published works are in the fields of politics, ethics, education, and philosophy. Early life and education She was born on November 19, 1949, in Brooklyn, New York, the only child of Kurt and Beatrice Gutmann. She was raised in Monroe, New York, a small town outside New York City. Her father was the youngest of five children in an Orthodox Jewish family in Feuchtwangen, Germany.The Daily Pennsylvanian  Gutmann remembers father's Holocaust experienceAmy Gutmann  Princeton Magazine He was living near Nuremberg, Germany, when Adolf Hitler ascended to power. He fled Nazi Germany in 1934 as a college student. After being denied asylum in the US, he brought his entire family, including four siblings, to join him in Bombay, India, where he founded a metal fabricating factory. Kurt Gutmann was still living in India in 1948 when he came to New York City for vacation. While there he attended a benefit at a Manhattan hotel, Essex House, where he met Beatrice, Amy's future mother, and the two were married weeks later.Amy Aims East - Philadelphia Magazine Gutmann told Adam Bryant of The New York Times in June 2011: Gutmann graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in Monroe, New York. She then entered Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1967 on a scholarship as a math major with sophomore standing. She received membership in Phi Beta Kappa and her Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1971, followed by a Master of Science degree in political science from the London School of Economics in 1972, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in political science from Harvard University in 1976.Penn: Office of the President: Dr. Amy Gutmann: Curriculum Vitae She is the first in her family to graduate from college. Academic career = Princeton University = Gutmann taught at Princeton University from 1976 to 2004. In 1990, she became the first Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor at Princeton and the founding director of its University Center for Human Values, among the first and best-endowed university-wide multi-disciplinary ethics centers in the world. As provost at Princeton University from 2001 to 2004, she oversaw Princeton's plan to expand the undergraduate student body by 10 percent and spearheaded the recruitment from Harvard of star professor K. Anthony Appiah (co-author with Gutmann of Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race).Jacques Steinberg, \\"A Harvard Star in Black Studies Joins Princeton,\\" New York Times, January 26, 2002, pA11 =University of Pennsylvania presidency= In her 2004 inaugural address Gutmann launched the Penn Compact, her vision for making Penn both a global leader in teaching, research, and professional practice; and a dynamic agent of social, economic, and civic progress. In 2017 she renewed and updated her vision with the Penn Compact 2022, recommitting the university to these ideals and outlining the next steps: First, to increase inclusion at the University with increases in faculty and student diversity. Second, to integrate knowledge across academic disciplines with a strong emphasis on innovation: Penn was named No. 4 in Reuters' Top 100 World Innovative Universities in 2017, 2018, and 2019. A third priority through the Compact is to have an impact locally, nationally, and globally to bring the benefits of Penn's research, teaching, and service to individuals and communities at home and around the world, most recently illustrated by one of Penn's biomedical research and clinical breakthroughs, approved by the FDA to treat cancer using a patient's own immune system. The Wall Street Journal also noted that \\"Today the university [Penn] lays claim to having incubated the world's biggest cancer breakthrough.\\" Fundraising and scholarships As president, Gutmann has overseen Penn's largest fundraising campaign ever, Making History. Launched in 2007, the Making History Campaign raised a record $4.3 billion, exceeding its goal by more than $800 million. It achieved its $3.5-billion target 16 months ahead of its December 31, 2012, conclusion. It was an unusually broad-based campaign, attracting gifts from nearly 327,000 donors. Gutmann is the only Penn president to lead two fundraising campaigns: the second, Power of Penn, was launched in March 2018 with a goal of $4.1 billion and priorities including a \\"Penn First Plus\\" initiative, targeted to support first-generation, low-income students. Gutmann has been a leading national advocate for financial aid based on need to promote socioeconomic diversity in higher education. Gutmann made Penn one of the handful of universities in the country that substitute grants for loans for any undergraduate student with financial need. In September 2009, for the first time in Penn's history, all undergraduates eligible for financial aid received grants rather than loans in their aid packages. Students from typical families with income less than $40,000 paid no tuition, fees, room or board. Students from typical families with incomes less than $90,000 paid no tuition and fees. In 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004. She and her husband Michael Doyle have also funded an endowed undergraduate scholarship and an undergraduate research fund at Penn. In 2017, they committed an additional more than $1 million for scholarships, supporting multiple students and matching funds for other donors. In 2014, Gutmann announced Penn Compact 2020 initiatives to create up to 50 new endowed professorships utilizing matching donor funds, and to raise an additional $240 million for undergraduate financial aid on top of the $360 million raised for undergraduate aid during the recently completed Making History campaign. Additionally, Gutmann announced unique and unprecedented awards for undergraduate students \\"with the most promising plans to improve local, national, or global conditions in the year after their graduation\\". In March 2015, Gutmann announced the selection of five students (four projects) as winners of Penn's inaugural President's Engagement Prize. The largest of their kind in higher education, the President's Engagement Prizes provide up to $150,000 annually for graduating seniors to design and implement impactful local, national, and global engagement projects. In its coverage of the first awards, The Philadelphia Inquirer stated, \\"Penn grads win chance to change the world.\\" In October 2015, she announced Penn's President's Innovation Prize, a corollary to the Engagement Prize that is focused on commercial ventures; the first winners were announced in April 2016. Shadrack Frimpong, a 2015 alumnus, used his President's Engagement Prize to start a school for girls, many of whom did not have access to education. Frimpong returned to Penn in 2018 to complete a degree in non-profit leadership and management at Penn to continue his work. Campus development Since arriving at Penn, Gutmann has also spearheaded a major campus development plan, Penn Connects, that includes that Penn purchased from the US Postal Service along the Schuylkill River, which opened as Penn Park in September 2011. Penn Connects is designed to boost the economic, educational and social capacity of Philadelphia and to create seamless gateways between West Philadelphia and Center City across the Schuylkill River. Penn began an expansion east of the Schuylkill River with the purchase of the DuPont Marshall Laboratory in September 2010. Gutmann said that the Marshall Lab property has \\"infinite possibilities\\" as a place to nurture startups and \\"technology transfer\\", where faculty with \\"great discoveries can attract venture capital\\" and bring ideas to market. In Fall 2016, Penn opened its Pennovation Center, the anchor of a 23-acre site that the university has dubbed Pennovation Works, on a Grays Ferry site along the south bank of the Schuylkill which was once home to the DuPont Co.'s Marshall Labs (where workers discovered the substance that led to the development of Teflon). The $35-million project is about 1 1/2 miles from the center of Penn's West Philadelphia campus. A large, red-letter sign reads \\"Pennovation\\" over the three-story, 58,000-square foot facility.Pennovation: Where ideas go to grow up Pennovation includes an addition that resembles a crystal formation, representing the \\"crystallization of ideas\\", and architecture critic Inga Saffron says that its unique design \\"announces the future\\", rather than harkening back to the past.Changing Skyline: At Pennovation, UPenn creates a lab for the social media age Johnson & Johnson announced in July 2018 that Pennovation Works would house J&J;'s first US-based JPOD, a networking hub that seeks to connect J&J; researchers and the local life sciences community. With the announcement, J&J; joined the ranks of global telecom giant Qualcomm and chocolate maker Hershey's, which also selected Pennovation Works to open Philadelphia operations. Protests on campus On December 8, 2014, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported that student protesters concerned about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, disrupted a holiday party for students at Gutmann's home. As a gesture of support for the students' cause, Gutmann joined them in lying on the ground to symbolize the four-and-a-half hours that Brown's body was left lying on the street in Ferguson after his death. Members of the Penn police force publicly responded to the show of support, with the head of the police union writing a public letter criticizing the move and the chief of the police department responding with a letter defending Gutmann's actions. Tenure as president On May 8, 2012, Penn announced that Gutmann's contract had been renewed through 2019. In announcing the extension, David L. Cohen, chair of Penn's Board of Trustees, stated that Penn's \\"Trustees feel very strongly that Amy Gutmann is simply the best university president in the country. Under her superb leadership, Penn is a stronger and more vibrant institution than at any time in its storied history.\\" In November 2016 Cohen, still Board Chairman, announced that Gutmann's contract would be extended until 2022, making her the longest-serving president ever at Penn. In 2017, Gutmann's total compensation was $2.9 million, making her the highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania and fourth highest in the United States. Scholarly career Through her writings, Gutmann has consistently sought to bridge theory and policy to advance the core values of a civil democratic society: liberty, opportunity and mutual respect. In a recent ranking of US political scientists in PhD-granting departments, she is ranked second-highest in citations among all political theorists, eighth-highest among all women political scientists, and has been cited more than any other political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Her first major contribution to political philosophy was her book Democratic Education (1987; revised 1999). The book addresses the central questions in the political theory of education: How should a democratic society make decisions about education? What should children be taught? How should citizens be educated? It was reviewed in Ethics as \\"the finest contribution to the literature on democratic education of the last seventy years\\" and fostered a revival of interest in the relationship between democracy and education. The book also takes on some contemporary scholarly debates: What is the appropriate response of democratic education to the challenge of multiculturalism? Should schools try to cultivate patriotic or cosmopolitan sentiments among students? Gutmann's second major contribution to political philosophy is a theory of deliberative democracy that she developed in collaboration with Harvard political scientist Dennis Thompson. Democracy and Disagreement (1996) calls for more reasoned and respectful argument in everyday politics. Deliberation can inform decision making through reasoned argument and develop society's collective capacity to pursue justice while finding mutually acceptable terms of social cooperation‚Äîeven when disagreements persist. Democracy and Disagreement has been praised as an effective remedy for polarized politics and criticized as impractical, as evidenced in a collection of pro and con essays published in Deliberative Politics, edited by Stephen Macedo. Defenders argue that more and better political deliberation can help all citizens. In her work Gutmann has applied the ideas of deliberative democracy to the US electoral process, President Barack Obama's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and healthcare organization in the United Kingdom. Gutmann's third major contribution to political philosophy is her analysis of group identity and its intersection with justice. In Identity in Democracy (2003), Gutmann argues that identity groups as such are neither friends nor enemies of democratic justice. She analyzes the legitimate but also problematic parts played by group identity in democratic politics and draws distinctions among the various types of identity group politics. She further developed this perspective in her nationally recognized 2018 Penn Commencement speech, \\"Think Uniquely, Stand United,\\" in which she said that \\". . . what makes us unique and what unites us are not starkly opposed. Uniqueness and unity are the twin pillars of a strong pluralism. We thrive when we combine unity of shared values with our unique perspectives on life. It has never been more important that we think uniquely while we stand united.\\" In May 2012, Gutmann published her 16th book, The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It (Princeton University Press), with co-author Dennis Thompson of Harvard. The authors posit that the difficulty of compromise is built into the democratic process itself, but so is the need for it. A better understanding and appreciation of compromise might be especially useful in this time of political polarization. Paul Starr of The New Republic said The Spirit: > Provide[s] grist for thinking through the difficulties of compromise in > [domestic policy], from tragic choices at desperate moments of history to > the routine nastiness in American public life today... Until recently, who > would have thought it necessary to offer Americans advice in the ways of > compromise? We used to enjoy a reputation for being a practical-minded > people, our politicians being regarded as an all-too-flexible species. But > something has changed, and according to Gutmann and Thompson, the change has > to do with the relation of campaigning and governing... Gutmann and Thompson > end their book with recommendations to strengthen the spirit and practice of > compromise.\\" Judy Woodruff of the PBS Newshour called the book \\"a clear-eyed examination of the forces that bring warring political leaders together or keep them apart. I wish every policymaker would read it\\". Gutmann's 17th book, co-authored with Jonathan Moreno, Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven, but Nobody Wants to Die, was published in 2019 by W.W. Norton. Board and leadership positions Gutmann serves on the board of The Vanguard Group since 2006, and has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Berggruen Institute since 2014. In 2009, Barack Obama appointed Gutmann chair of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, and reappointed her in early 2012. The Bioethics Commission has issued ten reports on a range of issues including protections for adult and pediatric participants in medical research, and the ethics of genomics and neuroscience. The commission's meetings all are open to the public and streamed live on the internet‚Äîand all its recommendations to the President were unanimous.Synthetic Biology Does Not Need Regulation Now, Panel Says - The New York Times Its capstone report, Bioethics for Every Generation, focused on the mission of bioethics commissions in advancing democratic deliberation and bioethics education. From 2005 to 2009, Gutmann served on the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, a committee that advises the FBI on national security issues relating to academia. From 2011 to 2013 she was a member of the National Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, which was convened by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2014, the Association of American Universities elected Gutmann as chair of its board of directors for a one-year term. From 2007 to 2019 Gutmann served on the Board of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. She was a member of the Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy from 2017 to 2019. Gutmann is a member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF), which convenes at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Personal life Gutmann is married to Michael Doyle, professor of law and international affairs at Columbia University. They have one daughter, Abigail Doyle, the A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University.

Early life Roberts was born in Jacksonville, Florida. Blind since the age of five due to glaucoma and cataracts, he attended the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida, the alma mater of blind pianist Ray Charles. Roberts began teaching himself to play piano at an early age, had his first lesson at age 12, and then studied the instrument with pianist Leonidas Lipovetsky while attending Florida State University. Career In the 1980s, Roberts replaced pianist Kenny Kirkland in Wynton Marsalis's band. Like Marsalis's, his music is rooted in the traditional jazz of the past. His style has been influenced more by Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller than McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans, with an emphasis on ragtime and stride piano rather than bebop. His album New Orleans Meets Harlem, Vol. 1 (2009) covers music by Scott Joplin, Duke Ellington, Morton, and Waller. He was commissioned by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Savannah Music Festival to write his first piano concerto, Spirit of the Blues: Piano Concerto in C-Minor. He has performed as a soloist in symphony orchestras with Marin Alsop (1992) and Seiji Ozawa. He returned to Japan in September 2014 to share the stage with Ozawa and the Saito Kinen Festival Orchestra. In 2012 he founded the band The Modern Jazz Generation, which released its first album in October 2014. This band has 12 musicians ranging in age from early 20s to 50s. He served as Associate Artistic Director for the Savannah Music Festival as well as the Director of the annual Swing Central high school band competition. He is on the faculty at Florida State. In 2014, Roberts was profiled on the television show 60 Minutes.

In Hindu philosophies, samskaras are a basis for the development of karma theory. In Buddhism the Sanskrit term Samskara is used to describe 'formations'. In Pali it is referred to as Sa·πÖkhƒÅra. According to various schools of Indian philosophy, every action, intent or preparation by an individual leaves a samskara (impression, impact, imprint) in the deeper structure of the person's mind. These impressions then await volitional fruition in that individual's future, in the form of hidden expectations, circumstances or a subconscious sense of self-worth. These Samskaras manifest as tendencies, karmic impulses, subliminal impressions, habitual potencies or innate dispositions.Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, , page 105 In ancient Indian texts, the theory of Samskara explains how and why human beings remember things, and the effect that memories have on people's suffering, happiness and contentment. Etymology and meaning The Sanskrit word sa·πÉskƒÅra (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞) has various context-driven meanings that broadly refer to \\"the putting together, accomplishing well, making perfect, a form of solemn recognition and getting ready\\" and \\"mental impression, recollection\\".saMskAra Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany The first context is at the etymological foundation of Sanskara term for rites of passage, while it is the second context, as a form of disposition, impression or behavioral inclination, that is at the etymological root of Sanskara word as a psychological concept in Indian philosophies. The concept of Samskara is also discussed as Vasana (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‡§æ vƒÅsanƒÅ), particularly in the Vai≈õe·π£ika school of Hinduism. Vasana also means \\"impression, inclination of anything remaining unconsciously in the mind\\".vAsanA Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionary, GermanyStephen Philips (2014), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, , page 134 Context Samskara, or Sankhara, is a significant concept across major schools of Hindu philosophy as well as Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Indian philosophy differ on the specific mechanisms about how samskara operates at the subconscious level. For example, Buddhism considers samskara as \\"causal continua\\" while being consistent with its \\"there is no self, no soul\\" premise, whereas the Vedic traditions within Hinduism consider samskara as \\"relational properties\\" (an impression, mark, impulse, tendency or a form of psychological potential energy within) that rests inside the \\"self, soul\\" of every person. In Yoga, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism, samskara constitute an affective and motivational field that contributes to the value structure within the person. They subconsciously or consciously endorse the basic inner drives that propel a human being in future action, future premises, future thoughts or future judgments.Howard Coward (1983), Psychology and karma, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 33, No. 1, pages 49-60 Das states that the Samskara rites of passage is a subset of actions in a human being's life, where going through the rite within the traditions of Hinduism, affects the individual internally as well as externally in how society perceives the person.L Das (2005), Culture as the Designer, Design Issues, MIT Press, Vol. 21, No. 4, pages 41-53 This occurs in the form of impressions and imprint within, that is samskara. Hinduism The Hindu schools differ in the details, but all posit that samskara are formed in every individual by a number of ways. This includes perceptions (what one sees, hears, touches, tastes, smells), chitta cognition (what one feels and thinks), willful actions, and also intentions before and during the action. Training and study, in these schools, is a form of exposition, introspective realization and in many cases practice or repetition to make the \\"impression, imprint\\" part of one's nature, where the practice reinforces the dispositions (samskara) and dispositions reinforce the practice, in a circular feedback. Scholars state that David Hume's \\"impressions\\" theory is similar to Samskara theory of Hinduism.David Dilworth and Hugh Silverman (1978), A Cross-Cultural Approach to the De-Ontological Self Paradigm, The Monist, Volume 61, Issue 1, pages 82-95, Clare Carlisle (2005), Creatures of habit: The problem and the practice of liberation, Continental Philosophy Review, Vol. 38, Issue 1-2, pages 19-39 The Hindu schools rely on samskara theory as one of the pillars for their epistemology (pramana), wherein they explain how and why man knows anything, remembers anything, expects anything, feels fulfillment, feels frustration, feels freedom and joy, or feels suffering and pain. Samskara are the impressions and dispositions that develop and accumulate deep inside a person, according to these schools, from perception, inference, choices, preparation, practice, interaction with others, thoughts, intent, willful actions and such karma. These manifest, state Hindu philosophies, as habits, behavior, tendencies, psychological predispositions and dispositions.Stephen Philips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 3: Karma Actions, studies, diligent preparation and inner resolutions trigger Samskaras ‚Äì hidden impressions or dispositions ‚Äì in the psyche of an individual, and these influence how the individual acts, perceives self and the manner in which the individual responds or accepts the karmic circumstances and the future. Ian Whicher explains that, in the philosophical theories of Hinduism, every karma (action, intent) leaves a smnskara (impression, impact, imprint) in the deeper structure of human mind. This impression then awaits volitional fruition, in the form of hidden expectations, circumstances or unconscious sense of self-worth. It manifests as tendency, karmic impulse, subliminal impression, habitual potency or innate dispositions.Larson and Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Vol 12, Yoga: India's philosophy of meditation, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 83 =Samkhya-Yoga= In Samkhya and Yoga schools, Sankhara, also spelled as Samskara, are impressions or residues that affect an individual's Gunas (behavior attributes). These impressions constitute part of the mechanistic foundation behind ancient Indian scholars' explanation on how karma theory works in practice. Samskara are explained as dispositions, character or behavioral traits either as default from birth or Samskara are behavioral traits perfected over time through Yoga, through conscious shaping of inner self, one's desire, sense of moral responsibility and through practice.Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, SUNY Press, , pages 99-102 In Yoga school of Hinduism, all actions and intents lead to impressions and memories, whether they are active or hidden, conscious or unconscious. A person may not remember his or her past karma, yet the impressions shape his character, the habits, the circumstances, the essence of that person because of the impressions left by the karma. These tendencies, subtle traces and innate characteristics, states the Yoga school, continue to affect the person's present actions, assumptions, attitudes (bhava), mind (buddhi), moral response and interactions with everyone, everything and self.Gerald Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 244 Vyasa, Patanjali and other ancient Indian scholars refer to these as karmic residues (karmasaya). Personality, states Patanjali, is the sum total combination of all these impressions and subtle traces (samskaras). Individuals tend to do what they did in past, man forms habit and oft returns to those habits, and behaviors tend to repeat because of these samskaras, according to these Yoga scholars. =Vedanta= These are viewed as traces or temperament that evolves through the refinement of an individual inner consciousness and expressed personality, and is a form of \\"being-preparedness\\" in Vedantic psychology. All physical, verbal and mental activity, according to the Vedanta school of Hinduism, creates Samskara, or traces inside a person. These Samskaras together then manifest as inner personality and external circumstances, and depending then on individual's response thereof, these then bear phala (fruit). In the state where an individual realizes Self and reaches jivanmukti (moksha), Shankara, Mandana, Sarvajnatman and other Vedanta scholars suggest that the causes of impressions such as ignorance disappear, the individual reaches inner resolution and complete acceptance of self, thus becoming free of samskaras and consequent blissful state of existence.Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation: Embodied Liberation in Advaita and Neo-Vedanta, State University of New York Press, , pages 10-82 =Nyaya and Vai≈õe·π£ika= In Nyaya school of Hinduism, Bhavana (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§æ) is synonymous with Samskara, a property that manifests as impressions or traces on the soul. It is a key concept in Nyaya philosophy, and it applies the idea to both living and non-living world. For example, the vega (velocity) of vayu (wind) is its samskara, in Nyaya literature.PB Shukla (2000), Metaphysics: Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , page 16 The concept is intimately related to Nyaya's search and reason-driven explanation of causes behind what happens in living and non-living world, and why. All voluntary actions, state Nyayayikas, have a cause, and these are guided by Samskara. For example, a newborn child voluntarily and instinctively acts to reach for the mother's breast. This action, explain Nyaya texts, must have a cause, but the newborn has neither been provided that knowledge nor has the value of the mother's breast been explained by another, nor has the newborn formed any Samskara in the new life. The newborn has that knowledge, that instinct, from some impression, some trace within \\"from a prior experience\\".John Derrett (1977), Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law, BRILL Academic, , pages 106-107 That is an example of Samskara, assert the Nyaya and Vai≈õe·π£ika scholars.Stephen H. Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 4 In Nyaya school of Hinduism, the existence of Samskara cannot be directly perceived, only inferred. Further, not all Samskara are psychological.Stephen Philips (2014), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, , pages 7-46, 134, 163-170 Some simply manifest as memories, premises or beliefs shaped \\"from a prior experience\\".Edward Craig, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, , page 690 Buddhism Sa·πÉskƒÅra or Sa·πÖkhƒÅra in Buddhism refers to mental \\"dispositions\\".David Kalupahana, \\"A History of Buddhist Philosophy.\\" University of Hawaii Press, 1992, page 71. These result from past volitions, and are causes of future volitions. Sa·πÖkhƒÅra also refers to that faculty within a person wherein these dispositions are formed.See, for instance, Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya. Boston: Wisdom Publications. , p. 45 Buddhism emphasizes the need to purify dispositions (Sa·πÖkhƒÅra) rather than eliminate them.David Kalupahana, Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way. Motilal Banarsidass, 2005, page 48. Jainism The activities of mind, speech and body, according to Jain philosophy, lead to Asrava, that is, the influx and imprint of karmic residues to the jiva (soul) of the living being.Anne Vallely (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, , pages 358-364 These residues bind (bandha), forming karma sarira,S Dasgupta (2004), A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 73-74 which can be stopped (sa·πÉvara) and released (nirjara). The operating mechanism, consistent with the dualism premise of Jainism, is not Sa·πÉskƒÅra as latent mental trace,Raj Pruthi (2004), Jainism and Indian Civilization, Vol. 4, , page 205 rather karma bandha to the soul. The rituals and rites of passage, called Samskara in Jainism, are part of the sa·πÉvara and nirjara initiation process, in order to free the soul from the crust of karmic residues.Pravin K.

The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and the broadcast license is held by Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses, Inc. WRGV broadcasts an urban contemporary music format to the greater Pensacola, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama, area. Its studios are located inside the building of unrelated television station WKRG-TV on Broadcast Drive in Mobile, and the transmitter is near Robertsdale, Alabama. History In 1976, 107.3 FM belonged to WAJB-FM, which was a beautiful music station with studios at the Tiger Point Country Club in Gulf Breeze, until it was purchased by Colonial Broadcasting in 1979. The format was changed to country music along with new call letters, WOWW-FM to become known as \\"WOW 107\\", moving its studios to Davis Highway in Pensacola. As the 1980s progressed, \\"WOW 107\\" would rise up to become a country music power house, overthrowing the heritage country station in the market, WXBM-FM, and winning several Billboard Magazine's Station of the Year (small market) awards. It was also known for its full-time News department, winner of multiple AP news awards. As the 1980s ended, so did WOW 107's run of being a ratings king, now owned by Sun Media Group. The 1990s saw several re-imaging attempts, including \\"The New WOW 107.3\\" and \\"107 Thunder Country\\", until its demise as a country station in 1995 when it became \\"New Rock One Zero Seven\\", flipping to alternative rock. Riding the popularity wave of mid-1990s Alternative Music, WOWW debuted at #1 in Arbitron's Persons 18-34, where it remained until the purchase and format flip by Paxson. New Rock 107 staff included Steve Williams-OM/AM Drive, Program Director Joel Sampson-PM Drive, Music Director LaLaine-PM Drive and Suzy Boe-Evenings among others. In 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, WTKX, \\"TK101\\". Two months later, both were purchased by Paxson Communications. After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's PD Joel Sampson, retained Midday personality Mark \\"the Shark\\" Dyba and added a majority of WOWW air staff and re-imaged itself as \\"The Rock Station\\", dropping the moniker \\"The New Rock Alternative\\", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format. After stunting for two days playing \\"Macarena\\" by Los del Rio non-stop, WOWW changed formats to oldies from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to WYCL (think \\"Way Cool\\"). As time went on, they phased out the 1950s music to include more 1970s songs. A billboard in downtown Pensacola advertising the change in format. Then in late 2004, the station's owner, now iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications), switched the music format to \\"My 107.3\\" and played 1970s and 1980s music. However, the \\"My 70s, My 80s\\" positioner was discontinued and the station used \\"My Variety\\" as its main positioner, in order to include a slightly wider variety of music. The playlist remained mostly 1970s and early 1980s, with a fair amount of 1960s and other 1980s songs, making it a basic classic hits format. For three years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the station played breaking news bulletins every hour on top of the hour (first provided by ABC News, then by Clear Channel Worldwide News), as well as \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at the start and close of each workday. Kiss FM logo, 2015-2017 In February 2010, the station ceased the \\"My 107.3\\" format and started airing the format of their sister station, \\"Lite Mix 99.9\\". On February 26, 2010, at 8:00 a.m. WYCL launched a new rhythmic adult contemporary format branded as \\"107.3 The Groove\\". The first song on The Groove was \\"Into the Groove\\" by Madonna. On March 5, 2010, WYCL changed their call letters to WRGV to go with \\"The Groove\\" branding. After a year as a Rhythmic AC, WRGV evolved to Rhythmic Top 40 in April 2011. On September 2, 2011 WRGV changed their format to Top 40 (CHR), branded as \\"107.3 Hit Music Now\\". It features the syndicated Elvis Duran Morning Show and former WABB staffers Reid and Matt McCoy.

PIP is sometimes referred to as \\"no-fault\\" coverage, because the statutes enacting it are generally known as no-fault laws, and PIP is designed to be paid without regard to \\"fault,\\" or more properly, legal liability. That is, even if the person seeking PIP coverage caused the accident, they are entitled to make a claim under the PIP portion of their policy. \\"No-Fault\\" does not mean that insurance premium of the person making the claim will not increase. Typically a PIP claim is made by the insured driver to their own insurance company, however, there are several exceptions that allow persons who have been injured in an accident to make a PIP claim if they do not own a vehicle. The particular state law and policy language of the insurer should be reviewed to see what exceptions exist in that state.  Auto insurance  PIP is a mandatory coverage in some states. PIP coverage may vary from state to state in terms of both what is covered and what types of treatments are considered medically necessary and reasonable. For example, in Utah, acupuncture is a permissible medical treatment, while in California it is not. In Texas, PIP coverage will cover medical expenses, eighty percent of lost wages, and someone to take care of the injured party. PIP insurance is mandatory in the state of Florida because it is considered a No-Fault/PIP state, this means that no matter who's at fault of the accident or if no one is declared ‚Äòat fault‚Äô a drivers PIP insurance is the primary provider of insurance coverage and pays a portion of medical care and treatment. Some states also allow for PIP claims even if a workers' compensation claim exists, while others do not. Some states PIP is the insurance of first resort to pay for medical bills when injured in an automobile accident. In some states, PIP is subrogatable, meaning that your insurance carrier will pay for your loss, regardless of liability, and then recover (or subrogate) what it paid from the liable party's insurance carrier. This generally leaves the claimant/insured in a much better financial position, because his or her medical bills are paid, and the insurance carriers get to fight it out on their own, and after the fact. PIP can cover, within the specified dollar and time limits, the medical and funeral expenses of the insured, others in its vehicle at the time of the loss, and any first party if struck as a pedestrian by any vehicle. The basic coverage is for the insured's own injuries, on a first-party basis, without regard to liability. Again, it is only available in certain states. A pedestrian struck by a vehicle is covered under that vehicles liability. Many states that do not have PIP have auto medical payments (AMP) coverage, and some states have both. AMP is also a first-party coverage, without regard to liability, but is only subrogable in a few states, and generally optional. AMP and PIP limits range from $1,500 to $250,000 depending on the injury and the state, though many insurance providers have a relatively low limit of $5,000. A Michigan no-fault policy provides unlimited medical and rehabilitation benefits.) Claimants involved in an auto accident are wise to submit their own insurance information to their medical providers, as third party carriers are under no legal obligation to pay a claimant's medical bills, while first party carriers are. Third party carriers are subject to payment only after a judgment against them, and any payments prior to that are considered voluntary. Settling a claim with a third party carrier is considered a voluntary payment. =States with mandatory PIP coverage= * Delaware * Florida * Hawaii * Kansas * Kentucky * Maryland (unless a waiver is signed at initial purchase of the policy) * Massachusetts * Michigan * Minnesota * New Jersey * New York * North Dakota *Oregon * Pennsylvania * Utah Certain states require insurance companies to offer PIP coverage, but allow the insured to reject it in writing: * Washington Once you reject the coverage it stays that way until you request it be added or start a new policy. * Texas * Arkansas is optional  Other coverage  Personal injury protection could also refer to personal injury insurance or coverage, which is insurance in any context which includes coverage for personal injury, particularly coverage for emotional distress (typically negligent infliction of emotional distress rather than intentional infliction of emotional distress), libel, or defamation as opposed to coverage for only bodily injury. Home insurance typically includes coverage for liability arising from bodily injury, especially on an insureds' premises, but not from liability arising from mental injury.

It is near the A1 road, 2 miles (3 km) southeast of Prestonpans and about east of Edinburgh. It is one of the oldest towns in East Lothian, and built on a gentle slope, about above sea level. The population of the town is approximately 12,582, an increase of over 4,000 since 2001, making it the second most populated town in East Lothian after Musselburgh. Tranent was formerly a major mining town, but now serves as a commuter town for Edinburgh. Memorial to the Massacre of Tranent in Civic Square The memorial commemorates people who resisted British militia conscription in 1797. History The name is thought to be of Brythonic origin, possibly containing the elements Tre and Nant, meaning town over the stream Travernant. Tranent was once an important mining town, and coal was first worked there in the thirteenth century by the monks of Newbattle Abbey who mined a nearby 2.5m / 7 ft thick coal deposit called the 'Great Seam'. The history of coal mining in Scotland is mirrored in the history of the coal heughs, mines and pits of Tranent. Tranent is now a commuter town supporting the south-east of Scotland and, more specifically, Edinburgh. The Massacre of Tranent took place in 1797, when local people were killed by soldiers after a protest against conscription into the county militia under the Militia Act of 1797. One of the 12 victims, Jackie Crookston, is depicted on the memorial that commemorates the dead in Tranent's Civic Square. In connection with the annual commemoration of the Battle of Prestonpans (originally called the Battle of Gladsmuir, and then renamed the Battle of Tranent, before many decades later being renamed the Battle of Prestonpans) there are plans to recreate a small portion of the Tranent to Cockenzie Waggonway which dates back to 1722. There is a long history of settlement in Tranent, perhaps dating back to prehistory. There are several historic buildings in and around the town, including the ruins of the old parish church, parts of which date from the 11th century and which was demolished in 1797, while a few miles south-west of the town stands Fa'side Castle, sometimes known as Falside or Fawside, a fourteenth-century L-shaped tower house. Isabella Begg nee Burns, the youngest sister of Robert Burns, moved to Tranent from Ormiston with her family after her son William resigned his post as the schoolmaster. She supported her family with the help of her daughters Agnes and Isabella, working as dressmakers. In 1843 she moved to Bridge House in Alloway, South Ayrshire. =Industry= Coal was first mined in Tranent Parish when Robert de Quincy granted rights in the early-thirteenth century to the monks of Newbattle to mine at Prestoungrange, which was then part of that parish. Soon many wealthy families in the parish joined the rush to mine coal. Heughs (surface mines), were being cut throughout the area. Longniddry, St. Germains, Fa'side, Ormiston (much later town) and Elphinstone, all parts of old Tranent, had their collieries and for the next 750 years, the industry prospered. Other industries grew to employ increasing populations: distilleries, breweries, tanneries and metal implement works. Quarries opened providing stone for homes. Farming was modernised and mills opened to provide food. The nineteenth-century saw a slowdown in industrial growth and, gradually, industry centralised and moved to larger centres. The coal industry had peaked and the twentieth century brought about a slow, but terminal decline. The last large deep mine closed in 1961, then in 2000, the opencast mine at Blindwells closed. Literature William Dunbar's poem the Lament for the Makaris includes the name Clerk of Tranent as a poet, probably of the fifteenth century, citing him as an author of the Anteris of Gawain. Some examples of such works exist but he has not been traced. Tranent is the birthplace of Lizzie in Lucy Booth's novel 'The Life of Death', a chilling love story in which Lizzie/Death enters a pact with the devil to regain her life, live and love.  Tranent's Gala  Since 1934 Tranent has held a Gala Week which is arranged by local volunteers who are part of the Gala Committee. Events during the gala week include the crowning of the Queen who is accompanied by 29 other children from the town, the celebrations on the fields at Ross High School and the grand parade which is made up of local groups and people and which goes through the town. Tranent Gala is funded by donations and fundraising. The Gala was first formed in 1934 by the miners of Tranent who aimed to form a special event for people in the town.

Its studios are on Civic Square. Places of Worship Throughout the history of Tranent, there have been several places of Worship. Currently, there is: Tranent Parish Church (Church of Scotland) - The present church at Tranent was built by John Simpson and opened in 1800, as what is believed to be at least the third church in the town. Local legend has it that a chapel dedicated to St. Martin of Tours and was associated with Lindisfarne in the 8th century. The first known mention of a church at Tranent came in 1145 when it was established by the archdeacon, Thor, son of a local landowner. The church was granted by Richard, Archbishop of St Andrews and later confirmed by Saer de Quincy, the local baron. Tranent parish came under the jurisdiction of the canons of Holyrood Abbey and the building was described as being of a higher standard than the normal country church. Although a settlement grew around the church by 1251, it remained in the hands of Holyrood. There are also canonical records of a chapel, dedicated to St. Peter, situated on a ridge overlooking a coal-bearing ravine at Travernant. The church was badly damaged in 1544 and 1547, each time by the forces of the Earl of Hertford during the Rough Wooing. Tranent Parish Church joined the Scottish Reformation when Thomas Cranstoun, the first minister took over from the evicted canons and the last Roman Catholic priest, Thomas Moffat; the church of St. Peter was now a reformed Protestant church. The church remained a ruinous condition, after Somerset's attack, into the 17th century and, though it was refurbished, it is not known when. The church was said to have been restored, extended and improved throughout, but in 1799 the decision was made to build a new church which was opened in 1800, a church which still stands high above the ravine overlooking the Firth of Forth. At a total cost of over 10,000 pounds, the church was extensively refurbished and refurnished in 1954. The congregation had to meet in the town hall during the work, but the church they returned to is much the same as it is today. The church is a category B listed building. Meets at 11 am every Sunday unless intimated at the church located on Church Street. St Martins of Tours (Roman Catholic) - This is the third church building on the site in one hundred years and was built in 1969, to designs by the prolific church architect Charles W Gray, in an octagonal shape using a Scandinavian compressed timber girder design. Contains two rough stained glass windows and an early 20th-century Italian crucifix above the altar. Irish limestone statue of classical design of St Martin as a Roman soldier and an original icon of St Martin in Orthodox style. Sunday Mass 9.30 am; Monday Eucharistic Service, 9.00 am; Tuesday Mass, 7.30 pm; Wednesday Eucharistic Service, 10.00 am; Thursday Mass, 10.00 am; Thursday Mass, 10.00 am; Friday Eucharistic service, 10.00 am Tranent and Cockenzie Methodist Church - Sunday service is at 11.00 am - In 2014, Cockenzie became a class of Tranent Methodist Church. In 2015, Tranent with Cockenzie began to meet and worship together at 28 Edinburgh Road, Prestonpans. The Salvation Army - 10.30am, Sunday Worship. 25 Winton Place, Tranent. Rivers of Fire Ministry - Formally the Fraser centre. Currently, meet and worship with the Salvation Army and are in the process of building a new centre.

It is known by the common names apple-of-Peru and shoo-fly plant. It is thought originally to have been native to western South America, including Peru, and is known elsewhere as an introduced and ruderal species ‚Äì sometimes as a weed ‚Äì in tropical, subtropical and, to a lesser extent, temperate areas all over the world. It has also long been cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers and curious fruits (the latter sometimes dried for use in floral design)Reader's Digest Encyclopaedia of Garden Plants and Flowers, fourth edition,1987. and has been adopted into the traditional medicine of countries far-removed from its original home. Description Plants grow to 1 metre tall and are vigorous with spreading branches and ovate, mid-green, toothed and waved leaves. The flowers are bell- shaped and 5 centimeters or more across, pale violet with white throats (occasionally pure white), opening only for a few hours in the day. The flower becomes lantern-like towards the end of its blooming period, the inflated calyces somewhat resembling those of certain Physalis spp., although in Nicandra (unlike in Physalis) the fruiting calyx is deeply lobed, (the sepals cordate) and not a single, undivided, bladder-like structure. The plant is thought to have insect repellent properties,Plants for a Future particularly in relation to whitefly. N. physalodes seeds have a relatively thick testa (seed coat) and exhibit strong dormancy, which may, however be broken by a combination of warm and cold stratification, involving temperature fluctuation between 15 and 25 ¬∞C. Distribution Nicandra physalodes is native to western South America ‚Äì Northwest Argentina, Bolivia, North and Central Chile and Peru. It has been introduced in many tropical and temperate regions worldwide. In the British Isles, the plant is a frequent casual, found in bare or sparsely grassy places, including cultivated ground, waste places and rubbish tips.Mabey, Richard Flora Britannica pub. Sinclair-Stevenson, an imprint of Reed International Books Ltd. 1996, page 302. Its occurrence is often traceable to the presence of its seeds in commercial brands of bird seed. Stock poison Nicandra physalodes is suspected of having poisonous properties similar to those possessed by certain Physalis species implicated in the poisoning of sheep.Lewis, Walter Hepworth and Memory Elvin-Lewis, P.F. Medical Botany : Plants Affecting Man's Health pub. Wiley-Interscience / John Wiley & Sons Inc. 1977. Some conflicting evidence in respect of these suspicions has emerged from Australia (where the plant is sometimes known as wild gooseberry), in which the plant has been suspected, on rather vague evidence, of poisoning stock at various times, although a feeding test carried out in New South Wales using a sheep and a goat gave negative results. A case was reported from New South Wales in 1970 in which two crossbred ewes died, apparently as a result of consuming this plant. The animals had been left to graze in a paddock of Wimmera ryegrass heavily infested with Nicandra physalodes plants of around 60 cm in height, such that they overtopped the grass. Both ewes died, with symptoms of bloat within 12 hours. At necropsy there were extensive hemorrhages in heart and lungs, but no other apparent abnormalities. The paunches of the ewes were observed to contain large amounts of Nicandra.Everist, Selwyn L. Poisonous Plants of Australia first published by Angus and Robertson, Australia 1974, revised edition published by same house as part of Australian National Science Library 1981, page 641. Uses The literature on the plant features somewhat conflicting accounts of use, as a species both edible and toxic/medicinal, pointing to the conclusion that it should be regarded as suspect and treated with caution. The whole plant is said to be toxic (even, according to some sources,Polunin, Oleg Wild Flowers of Europe, pub. Oxford University Press 1969, pps. 370-371. very toxic) and to be used medicinally as a diuretic, sedative and cough medicine. The tender leaves have, on occasion, been cooked as a leaf vegetable or pot herb (e.g. in the cuisine of Tanzania), yet the decoction of the leaves has been used as an insecticide to treat head lice; while the juice of the fresh leaves has been used to treat amoebiasis. Unspecified medicinal uses of the leaves have also been recorded in the folk medicine of Brazil and Madagascar. The rather dry, brown berries within the papery calyces have an odour reminiscent of cooking oil and, although described in at least one source as being poisonous, are eaten by the Raji people of Nepal. The seeds are said to be edible, but also to be employed as an insecticide and medicinally as an antipyretic, being boiled with water and taken for fever, indigestion and constipation, thus further implying laxative properties. The seeds are used in traditional Tibetan medicine in which system they are described as having an acrid taste and to possess 'a cooling, very poisonous potency' manifested in effects that are analgesic, anthelmintic, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic; being used also to treat toothache, impotence and unspecified 'contagious disorders' and furthermore to 'increase bodily vigour' (i.e. to function as an adaptogen) if consumed in regular doses. Nicandra physalodes is used as a folk remedy in several countries in the Himalaya, including Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Nepal and Sikkim,Polunin, Oleg and Stainton, Adam, Flowers of the Himalaya, pub. Oxford University Press 1984, page 288 although it is not native to the region. This may be due to a popular recognition of a familial resemblance - particularly in regard to calyces inflated at fruiting - to several native Solanaceous plants of the Himalaya long used in traditional medical practices, the genera involved being Anisodus, Physochlaina, Przewalskia and Scopolia (all belonging to tribe Hyoscyameae of subfamily Solanoideae). The much valued (and consequently over-harvested) species Anisodus tanguticus is perhaps particularly relevant in this context.Illustrations of the botany and other branches of the natural history of the Himalayan Mountains and of the flora of Cashmere by J. Forbes Royle.Published London, Wm. H. Allen,1839. In the southern U.S.A. the juice of the plant has been mixed with milk as a poisoned bait for houseflies and blow flies in the same way in which the crumbled caps of the fungus Amanita muscaria were used in parts of Europe.Lumpert (2016). \\"Catching flies with Amanita muscaria: traditional recipes from Slovenia and their efficacy in the extraction of ibotenic acid\\". Journal of Ethnopharmacology. 187: 1‚Äì8. doi:10.1016/j.jep.2016.04.009.Wasson, R. Gordon, Soma : Divine Mushroom of Immortality pub. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. 1968. However, the flies were said to be killed outright, rather than merely stupefied, as in the case of the mushroom/milk infusion. Chemistry Nicandra physalodes contains nicandrenones, a group of the steroidal lactones known as withanolides. The nicandrenones, like certain other types of withanolide, have insecticidal properties. 30 years after their discovery, the first total synthesis of nicandrenones was carried out in the year 2000.Stoltz, B. M.; Kano, T.; Corey, E. J. (2000). \\"Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Nicandrenones\\". Journal of the American Chemical Society. 122 (37): 9044‚Äì9045. doi:10.1021/ja0024892. Amongst its other paradoxical attributes, N. physalodes is also slightly intoxicating,Wink, Michael and van Wyk, Ben-Erik Mind-Altering and Poisonous Plants of the World, pub. Timber Press Inc. 2008. showing a certain degree of psychoactivity of a type similar to that elicited by the tropane alkaloid hyoscyamine (well known as one of the active principles present in the notoriously toxic nightshades Hyoscyamus niger and Atropa belladonna and causing mydriasis - a symptom said also to be caused by the alkaloids present in Nicandra). This property of the plant is reflected in one of the common names given it in France (namely belladonne de pays i.e. 'country belladonna') and likewise in the common name belladona given it in Bolivia.von Reis, Siri and Lipp, Frank J. jr. New Plant Sources for Drugs and Foods from The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium, pub. Harvard University Press 1982. It is not yet known whether this mild psychoactivity is referable to the alkaloid content or the withanolide content (or possibly to both - or indeed a synergy between the two). Like its more toxic relatives, Nicandra physalodes is alkaloidal, analyses having revealed the presence of the tropane alkaloid tropinone and the pyrrolidine alkaloid hygrine (0.1%, in the root). Withanolides are found almost exclusively in plants of the Solanaceae and, while it is noticeable that many psychoactive species belonging to that family contain only, or primarily, such compounds, not a single withanolide has yet been proven to be psychoactive. The compounds are named for the Solanaceous genus Withania, the best-known species of which, Withania somnifera, is, as its specific name suggests, mildly psychoactive to the extent of being sleep-inducing (among other useful medicinal properties). The use of W.somnifera (common name (i.a.) 'Indian ginseng') as a tonic (adaptogen) in Ayurvedic medicine parallels the use of Nicandra as an adaptogen in traditional Tibetan medicine (see above, under 'Uses') and is accounted for by withanolide content.R√§tsch, Christian, The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications pub. Park Street Press 2005, page 867.The Biology and Taxonomy of the Solanaceae edited by Hawkes, J.G., Lester, R.N. and Skelding, A.D. (Linnean Society Symposium Series Number 7) Published for the Linnean Society of London by Academic Press 1979, page 250. Also present in Nicandra are calystegines, a new group of polyhydroxy alkaloids with a nortropane skeleton and named for the bindweed genus Calystegia (Convolvulaceae). Their occurrence has been noted in several species of the Solanaceae, including Atropa belladonna. The biosynthesis of these compounds is thought to take place via the tropane alkaloid pathway, the first metabolite being pseudotropine.

He was also a vital figure in the establishment of professional baseball in Japan. Player Born in San Francisco, California in the Bayview neighborhood, O'Doul began his professional career as a left-handed pitcher with the minor-league San Francisco Seals of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He had some major-league success with the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox from to as a reliever. He pitched in one notable game on July 7, 1923, that would go down in the record books. Relieving for starter Curt Fullerton, O'Doul gave up 16 runs over 3 innings of relief, with 14 of those runs coming in the 6th inning alone. Although errors committed by Red Sox fielders meant that only 3 of the 16 runs were earned, O'Doul set the major league record for most runs allowed by a reliever in one appearance, a record later equaled by St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Johnny Stuart in 1925 and Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Dutch Schesler in 1931 (although both needed 8 innings to allow 16 runs). Following the season, O'Doul developed a sore arm, which forced him to give up pitching. After the 1923 season, the New York Giants returned O'Doul to the Pacific Coast League, where he was converted to a power-hitting outfielder. In 1927, he became the second of only four Pacific Coast League hitters to have hit 30 home runs and stolen 30 bases in a season (with the other three being Tony Lazzeri (1925), Frank Demaree (1934), and Joc Pederson (2014)). O'Doul returned to the majors in 1928, where he batted .319 as a platoon player. In , he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and, teaming up with Chuck Klein, had one of the best offensive years in baseball history, leading the league in batting at .398 with 254 hits, 32 home runs, 122 runs batted in, and 152 runs scored. His hit total broke the previous National League record of 250 by Rogers Hornsby of the 1922 St. Louis Cardinals. The record was tied by Bill Terry in . After batting .383 with 22 homers during the 1930 season, O'Doul was traded to the Brooklyn Robins (now the Los Angeles Dodgers). In , he batted .368 for Brooklyn to win another league batting title. After a slow start in , when he batted just .252 through 43 games, O'Doul was again traded, this time back to the Giants. He rallied to hit .306 the rest of the way that season, but played just one more year before ending his career in . In an 11-year major league career, he was in 970 games played, 34 games as a relief pitcher and the rest as an outfielder, posting a .349 batting average (1140-for-3264) with 624 runs scored, 175 doubles, 41 triples, 113 home runs, and 542 RBI. His on-base percentage was .413 and slugging percentage was .532. In seven seasons between 1928 and 1934, when he became a regular outfielder, he hit .353 (1126-for-3192). O'Doul hit over .300 six times, missing only in 1933 when he hit .284 playing with the Dodgers and Giants. He had 200+ hit seasons in 1929, 1930 and 1932. He had six five-hit games between 1929 and 1933, recording two each in 1929 and 1930 with the Phillies and one each in 1931 and 1933 with the Dodgers. Manager O'Doul then returned to the Pacific Coast League as manager of the San Francisco Seals from to , later managing several other teams in the circuit and becoming the most successful manager in PCL history. One of his outstanding accomplishments while managing the Seals was developing the young Joe DiMaggio, who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the New York Yankees. O'Doul refused to take credit for DiMaggio's success, saying \\"I was just smart enough to leave him alone.\\" Legacy O'Doul was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as the sport's goodwill ambassador before and after World War II. The Tokyo Giants, sometimes considered \\"Japan's Baseball Team\\", were named by him in 1935 in honor of his longtime association with the New York Giants; the logo and uniform of the Giants in Japan strongly resemble their North American counterparts. O'Doul was inducted into the San Francisco Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. He has the highest career batting average of any player eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame who is not enshrined. Contrary to popular belief, his hitting exceeded the standard of his era, had he played his first full season prior to the age of 31, he would have likely been inducted.[personal opinion] O‚ÄôDoul was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2013.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\".

O'Doul's fame and popularity live on in his hometown of San Francisco and are enhanced by the fact that his former team now thrives as the San Francisco Giants. The popular hofbrau-style restaurant and bar he founded in 1958 operated for years after his death as Lefty O'Doul's Restaurant and Cocktail Loungehttps://web.archive.org/web/20180807122310/http://leftysf.com/ on Geary Street, still serving his original recipe for Bloody Mary (although one news account says it was modified in the 1960s by O'Doul's bartender Chuck Davis).

There are approximately 13,000,000 speakers. Unlike Standard Korean, most of the variants of the Gyeongsang dialects are tonal, which is similar to Middle Korean. Gyeongsang dialects vary. A native speaker can distinguish the dialect of Daegu from that of the Busan-Ulsan area although the first city is less than 100 kilometers away from the latter two cities. Dialectal forms are relatively similar along the midstream of Nakdong River but are different near Busan and Ulsan, Jinju and Pohang as well as along the eastern slopes of Mount Jiri. Vowels Most Gyeongsang dialects have six vowels, a („Öè), e („Öî), i („Ö£), eo („Öì), o („Öó), u („Öú). In most areas, the vowels „Öê(ae) and „Öî (e) are conflated, as are „Ö°(eu) and „Öì(eo). W and y are generally dropped after a consonant, especially in South Gyeongsang dialects. For example, soegogi (Ïá†Í≥†Í∏∞) 'beef' is pronounced sogogi (ÏÜåÍ≥†Í∏∞), and gwaja (Í≥ºÏûê) 'confectionery' is pronounced ggaja (ÍπåÏûê). Vowels are fronted when the following syllable has a y or i, unless a coronal consonant intervenes. For example, eomi 'mother' is emi, and gogi 'meat' is gegi.Ho-min Sohn, 2006. Korean language in culture and society Consonants Southern Gyeongsang (specifically, nearby Namhae) dialects lack the tense consonant ss („ÖÜ). Thus, the speakers pronounce ssal (ÏåÄ), meaning \\"rice\\", as sal (ÏÇ¥) meaning \\"flesh\\". Palatalization is widespread: gy-, gi, ki and ky- are pronounced j and ch, e.g. Í∑§ is jul and Í∏∞Î¶Ñ is jileum, while hy- is pronounced s, e.g. Ìûò is sim. Many words have tense consonants where the standard is tenuis. Middle Korean z and Œ≤ are preserved as s and b, as in ÏÉàÎπÑ saebi for Standard Korean ÏÉàÏö∞ saeu \\"shrimp\\" or Í∞ÄÏÉà gasae for Standard Korean Í∞ÄÏúÑ gawi \\"scissors\\". Tone Dialects are classified as North Gyeongsang or South Gyeongsang based on pitch accent. North Gyeongsang has high tone, low tone (short vowel), and high tone (long vowel), whereas South Gyeongsang has high, mid, and low tone. For example, South Gyeongsang distinguishes s√≥ni 'guest', s≈çni 'hand', and s√≤ni 'grandchild'. Pitch accent plays a grammatical role as well, for example distinguishing causative and passive as in j√©p-pida 'make s.o. catch' and jep√≠da 'be caught'. In North Gyeongsang, any syllable may have pitch accent in the form of a high tone, as may the two initial syllables. For example, in trisyllabic words, there are four possible tone patterns:The Prosodic Structure and Pitch Accent of Northern Kyungsang Korean, Jun et al., JEAL 2005[ling.snu.ac.kr/jun/work/JEAL_final.pdf] *Î©îÎàÑÎ¶¨ ('daughter-in-law') *Ïñ¥Î¨¥Ïù¥ ('mother') *ÏõêÏñ¥ÎØº ('native speaker') *Ïò§ÎûòÎπÑ ('elder brother') Grammar The Gyeongsang dialect maintains a trace of Middle Korean: the grammar of the dialect distinguishes between a yes-no question and a wh-question, while Standard Modern Korean does not. With an informal speech level, for example, yes-no questions end with \\"-a (ÏïÑ)\\" and wh-questions end with \\"-o (Ïò§)\\" in the Gyeongsang dialect, whereas in standard speech both types of questions end in either \\"-ni (Îãà)\\" or \\"-eo (Ïñ¥)\\" without a difference between the types of questions. For example: * \\"Î∞• Î≠áÎÇò?\\" [Bap m√∫n-na?] or \\"Î∞• Î¨µÏùèÎÇò?\\" [Bap m√∫geut-na?] as opposed to \\"Î∞• Î®πÏóàÎãà?\\" [Bap meogeot-n√≠?] or \\"Î∞• Î®πÏóàÏñ¥?\\" [Bap meogeo-ss√©o?] (casual greetings in Korean.) ‚Äî \\"Did you have a meal?\\" or \\"Did you eat?\\" * \\"Î®∏ Î≠áÎÖ∏?\\" [Meo mun-no?] as opposed to \\"Î≠ò Î®πÏóàÎãà?\\" [Meol meogeot-ni?] or \\"Î≠ò Î®πÏóàÏñ¥?\\" [Meo meogeosseo?] ‚Äî \\"What did you eat?\\" Notice that the first question can be answered with a yes or no, while the latter question requires detail explanation of the food eaten. This phenomenon can also be observed in tag questions, which are answered with a yes or no. *\\"Eopje, ge√∫jya?\\" (ÏóÖÏ†ú, Í∑∏Ïüà?) as opposed to \\"Eopji, geureotch√≠?\\" (ÏóÜÏßÄ, Í∑∏Î†áÏßÄ?) ‚Äî \\"It isn't there, is it?\\" Sociolinguistics From the Park Chung-hee to the Kim Young-sam governments (1961‚Äì1997), the Gyeongsang dialect had greater prominence in the Korean media than other dialects as all of the presidents (except Choi Kyu-hah) were natives of Gyeongsang province. That is why some South Korean politicians or high-rank officials have been misunderstood for not trying to convert to the Seoul accent, which is considered standard in South Korea. However, when former president Kim Young-sam was in office, his public speeches were the subject of much scrutiny and his pronunciation elicited both criticism and amusement. He once mistakenly pronounced 'Í≤ΩÏ†ú (Gyeongje: meaning 'economy')' as 'Í∞±Ï†ú (Gaengje: a Gyeongsang pronunciation of the older generation for 'Í≤ΩÏ†ú')' and 'Ïô∏Î¨¥Î∂Ä Ïû•Í¥Ä (oemubu-janggwan: meaning 'foreign minister')' as 'Ïï†Î¨¥Î∂Ä Ïû•Í¥Ä (aemubu- janggwan: meaning 'physical intimacy minister')'. A humorous anecdote arose from another of his public speeches where audiences were said to have been surprised to hear that he would make Jeju a world-class 'rape' (Í¥ÄÍ¥ë [gwan gwang, tourism] > Í∞ïÍ∞Ñ [gang-gan, rape]) city by building up an 'adultery' (Í¥ÄÌÜµÌïòÎäî [gwantonghaneun, going-through]) > Í∞ÑÌÜµÌïòÎäî [gantonghaneun, adulterous]) motorway.

Bajaga and the Instructors) are a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band. Founded in Belgrade in 1984 by composer, lyricist and guitarist Momƒçilo Bajagiƒá \\"Bajaga\\", the group possesses a rich discography and a plethora of hit songs that placed them at the top of the former Yugoslav rock scene, alongside other mega- selling bands such as Bijelo Dugme and Riblja ƒåorba. History =1980s= The band's history begins in 1983. At the time Momƒçilo Bajagiƒá \\"Bajaga\\" was the guitarist for the hard rock band Riblja ƒåorba. During his work with Riblja ƒåorba, Bajagiƒá wrote music and both music and lyrics for several Riblja ƒåorba hits, but also wrote a large number of humorous pop-oriented songs that did not fit into Riblja ƒåorba's sound. He decided to release these songs on a solo album, and he started working on the album with a group of Belgrade musicians: vocalist Dejan Cukiƒá (a former Dizel, Tilt, and Bulevar member, and at the time a journalist working in the magazine Rock), bass guitarist Miroslav Cvetkoviƒá \\"Cvele\\" (a former Tilt, Pop Ma≈°ina, and Papatra member), guitarist Nenad Stamatoviƒá (a former Tilt, Zebra, Suncokret, and Bulevar member), and drummer Vladimir Goluboviƒá (a former Tilt and Suncokret member, at the time temporarily replacing Vicko Milatoviƒá in Riblja ƒåorba). During the work on the album, Bajagiƒá wanted only to record a large number of songs he wrote on an album and to remain a member of Riblja ƒåorba.

During their staying in Zagreb Bajagiƒá and Cukiƒá appeared as guests on the recording of Parni Valjak album Uhvati ritam, singing backing vocals on the title track,Uhvati ritam at Discogs which was the sign of gratitude to Parni Valjak for lending them a piece of drum kit for their first concert. The band held the official album promotion, organized by the Rock magazine, in Belgrade Dom Sindikata on April 21, and on this concert the band appeared under the name Bajaga i Instruktori, chosen after the idea of the journalist Peca Popoviƒá, for the first time. The concert featured Valentino and Bezobrazno Zeleno as the opening bands. The concert was well visited (mostly by teenagers) and the band's performance was well received. The success of Bajagiƒá's solo album caused conflicts inside Riblja ƒåorba, and on July 19, 1984, he was excluded from the band. During that summer Bajaga i Instruktori went on a tour, with Rade Radivojeviƒá on keyboards, playing mostly at youth work actions.

The album marked a slight stylistic change in the band's sound: the songs were simpler, without brass instruments, frequent on the band's previous releases, based on acoustic guitars and keyboards, and the songs \\"Plavi safir\\" (\\"Blue Sapphire\\"), \\"Vesela pesma\\", \\"≈Ωivot je nekad siv, nekad ≈æut\\" and \\"Ruski voz\\" featured folk music elements. However, virtually every song on the album became a hit.

At the beginning of 1994, Bajaga i Instruktori planned to perform in Slovenia, and there was a huge interest by the audience for these concerts. However, Slovenian authorities refused to issue visas to the band, which caused a scandal in Slovenian media. After the intervention of the Slovenian president Milan Kuƒçan, visas were issued to the members of the band, and they performed several concerts including a sold out concert in the Tivoli Hall. In March 1994 the band held three concerts in Belgrade's Dom Sindikata, with which they celebrated ten years of existence. After these concerts Bajagiƒá and Dragiƒá ended their cooperation. For a certain time, manager duties were carried on by Bajagiƒá, before Zoran Vuloviƒá, a former U ≈†kripcu keyboardist, became the band's new manager. In November 1994, after a concert in Pri≈°tina, came to conflicts inside the band, and Bajagiƒá excluded Stamatoviƒá and Goluboviƒá from the band, which ended Bajaga i Instruktori activity. At the time Bajagiƒá, with Lokner, wrote music for Mi≈°a Radivojeviƒá's film Ni na nebu ni na zemlji (Neither on the Sky nor on the Earth). The recordings featured members of the starogradska muzika band Legende (in the hit song \\"Moji drugovi\\"), Dragan Jovanoviƒá on acoustic guitar, Sava Latinoviƒá on tarabuka, and Aleksandra and Kristina Kovaƒç on backing vocals. The music was released on the album Ni na nebu ni na zemlji. During the same year Bajagiƒá wrote music for the TV show Otvorena vrata (Opened Door). In 1996, Bajagiƒá reformed Bajaga i Instruktori. The new lineup featured, beside Bajagiƒá, Milenkoviƒá, Cvetkoviƒá, and Lokner, the guitarist Vlada Negovanoviƒá (a former Butik, Doktor Spira i Ljudska Biƒáa, Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá's backing band, Tunel, and Dejan Cukiƒá's Spori Ritam Band member), and the drummer ƒåeda Macura (a former Neverne Bebe, Viktorija's backing band, Legija and Revolveri member). At the end of 1996 the band recorded the album Od bi≈æuterije do ƒáilibara (From Bijouterie to Amber). Bajagiƒá wrote all the songs, except \\"Ne volim zimu\\" (\\"I Don't Like Winter\\"), featuring music written by Milenkoviƒá. The album was produced by the band members, and featured Sa≈°a Habiƒá on cello.Od bi≈æuterije do ƒáilibara at Discogs The album featured hits \\"Silikon (2004)\\" (\\"Silicon (2004)\\"), Tvoja je gajba sigurna\\" (\\"Your Place Is Safe\\"), \\"Jo≈° te volim\\" (\\"I Still Love You\\"), \\"Iza nas...\\" (\\"Behind Us...\\"), \\"Ne volim zimu\\", and \\"≈†to ne mo≈æe niko mo≈æe≈° ti\\" (\\"You Can Do What Nobody Else Can\\").

It was delivered in December 2002. Romanow recommended sweeping changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of Canada's health care system. The proposed changes were outlined in the Commission's Final Report, Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada, which was tabled in the House of Commons on 28 November 2002. Although the Report of the Royal Commission dealt with a wide range of issues, much of the early attention was paid to the recommendations with respect to the financing of health care in Canada and especially transfers from the federal government to provincial and territorial governments. The Report set the stage for another round of federal-provincial/territorial bargaining leading to a significant agreement in September 2004 whereby the Government of Canada agreed to transfer an additional $41 billion over the next 10 years in support of an action plan on health. The new funding is meant to strengthen ongoing federal health support provided through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) as well as focus resources on addressing the fact that Canadians, like citizens in other OECD countries, often have significant wait times for access to essential health care services. Issues highlighted by the Romanow Report =Aboriginal issues= The report identifies significant problems in the way that aboriginal health is managed. Surprisingly, this is largely not due to a lack of funding; there is simply a mismanagement of assets. Funding sources are fragmented and there is no established system to provide care. In addition, there are extensive equity concerns due to this fragmentation of funding and differential care available to different Aboriginal communities. As a result, the report suggests that new administration procedures be put in place. Integration of on-reserve healthcare into the current system is not a popular option amongst aboriginal leaders, although serves as a reasonable option for urban aboriginal healthcare. Specifically, the report suggests the formation of Aboriginal Partnerships that are an administrative authority composed of representatives from different levels of government and the aboriginal community. These partnerships may work in a method similar to a regional health authority. They will serve as an organization with a specific health goal, such as organizing the public health and primary care for a community. The partnership will be granted federal funds to pursue these health goals in a manner that Partnership executives agree upon. Aboriginal representation in the Partnership ensures that these services are fitting with the cultural needs of the Aboriginal community. Partnerships will also interface with the existing health system to coordinate access to resources such as diagnostics and specialized care. In an urban setting, the Partnership will serve as a voluntary health organization that coordinates access to specific health facilities such as primary care and diagnostics. The Partnership will have similar representation from Aboriginal community ensuring that services provided in the urban environment are still sensitive to Aboriginal cultural and linguistic concerns. Partnerships are especially needed in urban settings due to the specific needs of urban Aboriginals for problems such as diabetes and addiction. Furthermore, Partnerships may serve as an additional urban community organization that interfaces with other such Aboriginal organizations to serve as activists for the socioeconomic status of Aboriginals. An important point stressed by the Romanow report is that healthcare initiatives must be accountable towards the taxpayer and consumer. Aboriginal health is no different; Partnerships must be closely monitored and their effect on health outcomes determined. Changes in policy may be necessitated as this is a new approach.The Romanow Report: A new approach to aboriginal health. Romanow's recommendations The conclusion of the Report set out 47 recommendations along with a timetable for their implementation. Recommendation 1 ‚Äì A new Canadian Health Covenant should be established as a common declaration of Canadians‚Äô and their governments‚Äô commitment to a universally accessible, publicly funded health care system. To this end, First Ministers should meet at the earliest opportunity to agree on this Covenant. Recommendation 2 ‚Äì A Health Council of Canada should be established by the provincial, territorial and federal governments to facilitate co-operation and provide national leadership in achieving the best health outcomes in the world. The Health Council should be built on the existing infrastructure of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and the Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment (CCOHTA). Recommendation 3 ‚Äì On an initial basis, the Health Council of Canada should: Establish common indicators and measure the performance of the health care system; Establish benchmarks, collect information and report publicly on efforts to improve quality, access and outcomes in the health care system; and coordinate existing activities in health technology assessment and conduct independent evaluations of technologies, including their impact on rural and remote delivery and the patterns of practice for various health care providers. Recommendation 4 ‚Äì In the longer term, the Health Council of Canada should provide ongoing advice and coordination in transforming primary health care, developing national strategies for Canada‚Äôs health workforce, and resolving disputes under a modernized Canada Health Act. Recommendation 5 ‚Äì The Canada Health Act should be modernized and strengthened by: Confirming the principles of public administration, universality and accessibility, updating the principles of portability and comprehensiveness, and establishing a new principle of accountability; Expanding insured health services beyond hospital and physician services to immediately include targeted home care services followed by prescription drugs in the longer term; Clarifying coverage in terms of diagnostic services; Including an effective dispute resolution process; and Establishing a dedicated health transfer directly connected to the principles and conditions of the Canada Health Act. Recommendation 6 ‚Äì To provide adequate funding, a new dedicated cash-only Canada Health Transfer should be established by the federal government. To provide long-term stability and predictability, the Transfer should include an escalator that is set in advance for five year periods. Recommendation 7 ‚Äì On a short-term basis, the federal government should provide targeted funding for the next two years to establish: a new Rural and Remote Access Fund; a new Diagnostic Services Fund; a Primary Health Care Transfer; a Home Care Transfer; and a Catastrophic Drug Transfer Recommendation 8 ‚Äì A personal electronic health record for each Canadian that builds upon the work currently underway in provinces and territories. Recommendation 9 ‚Äì Canada Health Infoway should continue to take the lead on this initiative and be responsible for developing a pan-Canadian electronic health record framework built upon provincial systems, including ensuring the interoperability of current electronic health information systems and addressing issues such as security standards and harmonizing privacy policies. Recommendation 10 ‚Äì Individual Canadians should have ownership over their personal health information, ready access to their personal health records, clear protection of the privacy of their health records, and better access to comprehensive and credible information about health, health care and the health system. Recommendation 11 ‚Äì Amendments should be made to the Criminal Code to protect Canadians‚Äô privacy and to explicitly prevent the abuse or misuse of personal health information, with violations in this area considered a criminal offense. Recommendation 12 ‚Äì Canada Health Infoway should support health literacy by developing and maintaining an electronic health information base to link Canadians to health information that is properly researched, trustworthy and credible as well as support more widespread efforts to promote good health. Recommendation 13 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should take action to streamline technology assessment in Canada, increase the effectiveness, efficiency and scope of technology assessment, and enhance the use of this assessment in guiding decisions. Recommendation 14 ‚Äì Steps should be taken to bridge current knowledge gaps in applied policy areas, including rural and remote health, health human resources, health promotion, and pharmaceutical policy. Recommendation 15 ‚Äì A portion of the proposed Rural and Remote Access Fund, the Diagnostic Services Fund, the Primary Health Care Transfer, and the Home Care Transfer should be used to improve the supply and distribution of health care providers, encourage changes to their scopes and patterns of practice, and ensure that the best use is made of the mix of skills of different health care providers. Recommendation 16 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should systematically collect, analyze and regularly report on relevant and necessary information about the Canadian health workforce, including critical issues related to the recruitment, distribution, and remuneration of health care providers. Recommendation 17 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should review existing education and training programs and provide recommendations to the provinces and territories on more integrated education programs for preparing health care providers, particularly for primary health care settings. Recommendation 18 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should develop a comprehensive plan for addressing issues related to the supply, distribution, education and training, remuneration, skills and patterns of practice for Canada‚Äôs health workforce. Recommendation 19 ‚Äì The proposed Primary Health Care Transfer should be used to ‚Äúfast-track‚Äù primary health care implementation. Funding should be conditional on provinces and territories moving ahead with primary health care reflecting four essential building blocks ‚Äì continuity of care, early detection and action, better information on needs and outcomes, and new and stronger incentives to achieve transformation. Recommendation 20 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should sponsor a National Summit on Primary Health Care within two years to mobilize concerted action across the country, assess early results, and identify actions that must be taken to remove obstacles to primary health care implementation. Recommendation 21 ‚Äì The Health Council of Canada should play a leadership role in following up on the outcomes of the Summit, measuring and tracking progress, sharing information and comparing Canada‚Äôs results to leading countries around the world, and reporting to Canadians on the progress of implementing primary health care in Canada. Recommendation 22 ‚Äì Prevention of illness and injury, and promotion of good health should be strengthened with the initial objective of making Canada a world leader in reducing tobacco use and obesity. Recommendation 23 ‚Äì All governments should adopt and implement the strategy developed by the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Sport, Recreation and Fitness to improve physical activity in Canada. Recommendation 24 ‚Äì A national immunization strategy should be developed to ensure that all children are immunized against serious illnesses and Canada is well prepared to address potential problems from new and emerging infectious diseases. Recommendation 25 ‚Äì Provincial and territorial governments should use the new Diagnostic Services Fund to improve access to medical diagnostic services. Recommendation 26 ‚Äì Provincial and territorial governments should take immediate action to manage wait lists more effectively by implementing centralized approaches, setting standardized criteria, and providing clear information to patients on how long they can expect to wait. Recommendation 27 ‚Äì Working with the provinces and territories, the Health Council of Canada should establish a national framework for measuring and assessing the quality and safety of Canada‚Äôs health care system, comparing the outcomes with other OECD countries, and reporting regularly to Canadians. Recommendation 28 ‚Äì Governments, regional health authorities, health care providers, hospitals and community organizations should work together to identify and respond to the needs of official language minority communities. Recommendation 29 ‚Äì Governments, regional health authorities, and health care providers should continue their efforts to develop programs and services that recognize the different health care needs of men and women, visible minorities, people with disabilities, and new Canadians. Recommendation 30 ‚Äì The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to attract and retain health care providers. Recommendation 31 ‚Äì A portion of the Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support innovative ways of expanding rural experiences for physicians, nurses and other health care providers as part of their education and training. Recommendation 32 ‚Äì The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support the expansion of telehealth approaches. Recommendation 33 ‚Äì The Rural and Remote Access Fund should be used to support innovative ways of delivering health care services to smaller communities and to improve the health of people in those communities. Recommendation 34 ‚Äì The proposed new Home Care Transfer should be used to support expansion of the Canada Health Act to include medically necessary home care services in the following areas: Home mental health case management and intervention services should immediately be included in the scope of medically necessary services covered under the Canada Health Act; Home care services for post-acute patients, including coverage for medication management and rehabilitation services, should be included under the Canada Health Act; and palliative home care services to support people in their last six months of life should also be included under the Canada Health Act. Recommendation 35 ‚Äì Human Resources Development Canada, in conjunction with Health Canada should be directed to develop proposals to provide direct support to informal caregivers to allow them to spend time away from work to provide necessary home care assistance at critical times. Recommendation 36 ‚Äì The proposed new Catastrophic Drug Transfer should be used to reduce disparities in coverage across the country by covering a portion of the rapidly growing costs of provincial and territorial drug plans. Recommendation 37 ‚Äì A new National Drug Agency should be established to evaluate and approve new prescription drugs, provide ongoing evaluation of existing drugs, negotiate and contain drug prices, and provide comprehensive, objective and accurate information to health care providers and to the public. Recommendation 38 ‚Äì Working collaboratively with the provinces and territories, the National Drug Agency should create a national prescription drug formulary based on a transparent and accountable evaluation and priority-setting process. Recommendation 39 ‚Äì A new program on medication management should be established to assist Canadians with chronic and some life-threatening illnesses. The program should be integrated with primary health care approaches across the country. Recommendation 40 ‚Äì The National Drug Agency should develop standards for the collection and dissemination of prescription drug data on drug utilization and outcomes. Recommendation 41 ‚Äì The federal government should immediately review the pharmaceutical industry practices related to patent protection, specifically, the practices of evergreening and the notice of compliance regulations. This review should ensure that there is an appropriate balance between the protection of intellectual property and the need to contain costs and provide Canadians with improved access to non-patented prescription drugs. Recommendation 42 ‚Äì Current funding for Aboriginal health services provided by the federal, provincial and territorial governments and Aboriginal organizations should be pooled into single consolidated budgets in each province and territory to be used to integrate Aboriginal health care services, improve access, and provide adequate, stable and predictable funding. Recommendation 43 ‚Äì The consolidated budgets should be used to fund new Aboriginal Health Partnerships that would be responsible for developing policies, providing services and improving the health of Aboriginal peoples. These partnerships could take many forms and should reflect the needs, characteristics and circumstances of the population served. Recommendation 44 ‚Äì Federal and provincial governments should prevent potential challenges to Canada‚Äôs health care system by: Ensuring that any future reforms they implement are protected under the definition of ‚Äúpublic services‚Äù included in international law or trade agreements to which Canada is party; and reinforcing Canada‚Äôs position that the right to regulate health care policy should not be subject to claims for compensation from foreign- based companies. Recommendation 45 ‚Äì The federal government should build alliances with other countries, especially with members of the World Trade Organization, to ensure that future international trade agreements, agreements on intellectual property, and labour standards make explicit allowance for both maintaining and expanding publicly insured, financed and delivered health care. Recommendation 46 ‚Äì The federal government should play a more active leadership role in international efforts to assist developing nations in strengthening their health care systems through foreign aid and development programs. Particular emphasis should be placed on training health care providers and on public health initiatives.

Walther was born at Erfurt. Not only was his life almost exactly contemporaneous to that of Johann Sebastian Bach, he was the famous composer's cousin. Walther was most well known as the compiler of the Musicalisches Lexicon (Leipzig, 1732), an enormous dictionary of music and musicians. Not only was it the first dictionary of musical terms written in the German language, it was the first to contain both terms and biographical information about composers and performers up to the early 18th century. In all, the Musicalisches Lexicon defines more than 3,000 musical terms; Walther evidently drew on more than 250 separate sources in compiling it, including theoretical treatises of the early Baroque and Renaissance. The single most important source for the work was the writings of Johann Mattheson, who is referenced more than 200 times. Some further information on Walther can be found in the book Musica Poetica by Dietrich Bartel. On page 22, Bartel quotes Walther's definition of musica poetica, or musical rhetoric, as: :\\"Musica Poetica or musical composition is a mathematical science through which an agreeable and correct harmony of the notes is brought to paper in order that it might later be sung or played, thereby appropriately moving the listeners to Godly devotion as well as to please and delight both mind and soul‚Ä¶. It is so called because the composer must not only understand language as does the poet in order not to violate the meter of the text but because he also writes poetry, namely a melody, thus deserving the title Melopoeta or Melopoeus.\\" (22) Walther was the music teacher of Prince Johann Ernst von Sachsen-Weimar. He wrote a handbook for the young prince with the title Praecepta der musicalischen Composition, 1708. It remained handwritten until Peter Benary's edition (Leipzig, 1955). As an organ composer, Walther became famous for his organ transcriptions of orchestral concertos by contemporary Italian and German masters. He made 14 transcriptions of concertos by Albinoni, Gentili, Taglietti, Giuseppe Torelli, Vivaldi and Telemann. These works were the models for Bach to write his famous transcriptions of concertos by Vivaldi and others. On the other hand, Walther as a city organist of Weimar wrote exactly 132 organ preludes based on Lutheran chorale melodies. Some free keyboard music also belongs to his legacy.

It is located in the town of Gunsan (also romanized as Kunsan), about south of Seoul. Kunsan Air Base is the home of the 8th Fighter Wing, \\"The Wolf Pack,\\" assigned to the Pacific Air Forces Seventh Air Force and the 38th Fighter Group of the Republic of Korea Air Force. About 45 F-16 aircraft are stationed at the base.https://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/Army- Fires-New-Stryker-30mm-Cannon-Preps-for-Major-Land-War-108357646 It is one of two major Air Force installations operated by the United States Forces Korea, the other being Osan Air Base.  History  Seventh Air Force Bases Jet- Assisted Takeoff (JATO) bottles attached to the fuselage. B-26Bs of the 3d Bomb Wing F-84G-25-RE Thunderjet AF Serial No. 52-3249 of the 49th Fighter- Bomber Wing being refuelled over Korea, 1953 The history of Kunsan Air Base dates back to 1938, when Japanese forces occupying Korea built a base near Kunsan for fighter-interceptor aircraft. The United States first used the base in 1945, but on a very small scale. From 1945 to 1950, the Army and later the Air Force intermittently operated small detachments from Kunsan, with these detachments maintaining liaison aircraft. At most these detachments contained a handful of people. When the United States pulled its combat units out of the Republic of Korea in 1949, it left only a Military Assistance Advisory Group in the country, and the periodic detachments at Kunsan became even more infrequent. = Korean War = When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, Kunsan Air Base had no United States flying units assigned. In their rapid advance, the invading North Koreans captured Kunsan Air Base on 13 July 1950. The 24th Infantry Division retook Kunsan in October 1950, and the Chinese intervention that winter failed to push far enough south to put Kunsan in jeopardy. United States forces first operated in significant numbers from the base in 1951. The first USAF unit to be assigned to the base was the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, which arrived on 1 April 1951. The 27th Fighter Escort Wing was one of the first F-84 Thunderjet units to see combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War. Improvements to the base were needed, however, to accommodate jet fighters. The 27th FEW was reassigned at the end April and the Army's 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion built a runway to replace the sod runway constructed by Japanese. This runway was known as Taxiway Charlie (06/24). By August, construction had progressed to the point that heavier units could be based at Kusan and the USAF assigned the 3rd Bombardment Wing to Kunsan. The 3rd Bomb Wing consisting of the 8th, 13th and 90th Bomb Squadrons flew the B-26 Invader bomber during the war, remaining at Kunsan from August 1951 until October 1954. A Marine aviation squadron, VMF(N)-513, arrived in April 1952, and a few months later the base added the 474th Fighter-Bomber Group, which included three squadrons of F-84 fighters, bringing the total size of the operation to one wing, one group, and a Marine fighter squadron. The 474th bombed and strafed such targets as bunkers, troops, artillery positions, bridges, vehicles, airfields, and power plants, and sometimes escorted bombers that attacked munitions factories and other objectives. In April 1953, the 474th Fighter-Bomber Group returned to the United States and was replaced by the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing, also flying the F-84. During the Korean War, the large number of locations used for bases and the similarity of some geographical names prompted the Air Force to use alphanumeric identifiers for bases in addition to their proper designations. Under this system, each base in Korea received a \\"K number,\\" simplifying positive identification when referring to the various bases. Kunsan received the number K-8, while Osan Air Base was also known as K-55. = Cold War = After hostilities ceased, the base began to draw down. The F-84 forces of the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing left in November 1953, and by October 1954 the host unit of the base, the 3d Bombardment Wing, also departed. This left the base with a much-reduced mission. From 1953 to 1954, the 808th and 841st Engineering Aviation Battalions constructed what is today's main runway. For the next several years Kunsan merely hosted periodic rotations of fighter and light bomber squadrons, with base facilities maintained and operated by an air base group. During 1957 and 1958 the base hosted squadrons from Japan temporarily. During 1957‚Äì8 a Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) F-86 Sabre crashed into the Yellow Sea south of the base after having a flame out and a USAF F-100 Super Sabre crashed in the rice paddies north of the base. The base remained a radar site as a back up during this time to Osan, until the Radar site was turned over to the ROKAF in mid 1958. The Osan detachment on the base also maintained a radio relay site from a hill on the base. Then the base remained relatively dormant, hosting temporary deployments of flying units and serving as a safe haven base for aircraft evacuated from Okinawa and Guam during typhoons. In 1965, the ROKAF assigned a squadron of F-86 fighters to the base. This ROKAF unit was the only permanently assigned flying contingent at Kunsan until after the Pueblo incident in 1968. McDonnell Douglas F-4E-34-MC Phantom AF Serial No 67-0231 of the 16th Tactical Fighter Squadron on TDY from Eglin AFB Florida ‚Äì Attached to 354th TFW at Kusan AB South Korea ‚Äì April 1, 1970 At an unknown date in this time frame, the US Army 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade assigned Battery B, 6th Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, a HAWK missile unit to the base. The Tactical Operations site was located on a hill just off the coast, but near the base. Its mission was to defend the base from air attack. The HAWK site and all hardware was turned over to the Korean Army sometime in the early 1990s. After the USS Pueblo was captured by the North Koreans in January 1968 the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing deployed to Korea on January 25, 1968. Under the command of Col. Jack Hayes F-4D Phantom IIs arrived at Kunsan on January 29, 1968 as part of Operation Combat Fox. In March Col. Hayes was replaced by Col. Chuck Yeager, the 4th remained in Korea until replaced by the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing. The 354th TFW consisting of the Kansas Air National Guard, the Ohio Air National Guard, (ANG) and a few members of the District of Columbia Air National Guard flying the F-100, arrived at Kunsan in July 1968, as part of the buildup of forces in Korea. In 1969 the wing began a transition from the F-100 to the F-4 Phantom. The 354th remained until June 1970, when the base again returned to hosting temporary deployments, such as the four-month activation of the 54th Tactical Fighter Wing from June through October 1970. The 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, previously designated the 3d Bombardment Wing, stationed at Kunsan in the early 1950s, arrived in March 1971 to assume control of the base. Like the 354th and 54th, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing flew the F-4 Phantom. Aircraft came primarily from Misawa AB Japan, 475th Tactical Fighter Wing after it was inactivated and as were most of the personnel initially assigned to the 3rd TFW. When it first activated in May, the wing contained the 35th, 36th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In September, the 36th TFS transferred to Osan AB. In September 1974 the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, the \\"Wolf Pack,\\" was transferred from Ubon Air Base, Thailand to replace the 3rd at Kunsan. The move took place in name only, as the 8th moved without personnel or equipment, absorbing all assets of the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing. This included the two flying squadrons, which continued to operate as the 35th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, reuniting the wing with two of its original squadrons. Since then, the 8th has continued to serve as host unit of Kunsan Air Base, continually improving the base's facilities over the years. In February 2018 it was announced that following the completion of construction of hangars and supporting facilities at the base, 12 MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS' will be deployed to Kunsan in March/April 2018. = Major Commands = * US Army Pacific Air Command, (1946‚Äì47) * Far East Air Forces, (1947‚Äì57) * Pacific Air Forces, (1957‚Äìpresent) =Base operating units= * 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, (April ‚Äì May 1951) * 931st Engineering Aviation Group (May ‚Äì August 1951) * 3d Bombardment Wing (August 1951 ‚Äì September 1954) * 6170th Air Base Group (September 1954 ‚Äì April 1956) * 6170th Air Base Squadron (April 1956 ‚Äì March 1959) * 6175th Air Base Group (March 1959 ‚Äì August 1968) * 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (August 1968 ‚Äì June 1970) * 6175th Air Base Group (June 1970 ‚Äì March 1971) * 3d Tactical Fighter Wing (March 1971 ‚Äì September 1974) * 8th Fighter Wing (September 1974 ‚Äì present) =Major USAF units assigned= * 27th Fighter-Escort Wing (April 1951) * 3d Bombardment Wing (August 1951 ‚Äì October 1954) * 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing (July 1952 ‚Äì April 1953) * 49th Fighter- Bomber Wing (April ‚Äì November 1953) * 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (July 1968 ‚Äì June 1970) * 54th Tactical Fighter Wing (June ‚Äì October 1970) * 3d Tactical Fighter Wing (March 1971 ‚Äì September 1974) * 8th Fighter Wing (September 1974‚Äìpresent) Kunsan has provided support for F-84G Thunderjet, B-26 Invader, F-86 Sabre, RF-100 Super Sabre, RB-57 Canberra, F-100 Super Sabre, F-4 Phantom II, and F-16 Fighting Falcon operations.

It was completed in March 1973. He also composed a variation for six marimbas, called Six Marimbas, in 1986. The world premi√®re performance of Six Pianos was in May 1973 at the John Weber Gallery in New York City. The European premi√®re took place in January the next year in Stuttgart, Germany. Reich's idea was originally for a piece titled \\"Piano Store\\" that could be played on all the pianos in a piano store. A friend in New York gave him and his fellow musicians access to the Baldwin Piano and Organ Company's premises during evenings, where they could try out ideas. Reich eventually settled on an ensemble of six upright pianos in close proximity, which would allow very precise timing without being masked by the resonance of grand pianos.  Structure  The piece begins with three pianists playing different notes to the same 8-beat rhythmic pattern. Then two more pianists begin to play the same pattern shifted two beats out of phase. (Phasing is a prominent technique in most of Steve Reich's work.) Different phase shifts of the same motifs fade in and out of the ever-changing musical texture for the duration of the piece. The piece also uses the additive technique of gradually building up parts by substituting notes for rests, and the opposite.Reich, Steve (2002). Writings on Music, 1965-2000, p.73. . Six Pianos is also notable by being one of Reich's only pieces in duple time. The London Sinfonietta performing Six Marimbas in 2005Six Pianos has three sections, separated by relatively sudden changes of tonal center, though they all use the same seven pitch classes of the D major diatonic scale. The first section is in D major, with the tonality anchored in place by a persistent pattern of D and A in the bass. Then that pattern slowly fades out, leaving a B minor tonality which serves as a short transition to the second section in E Dorian. A sudden transition leads to the third section in B natural minor. Six Marimbas follows the same structure, but is transposed down by one semitone so that the piece opens in D flat major and concludes in B flat natural minor. Adapted versions Six Marimbas Counterpoint is a version of Six Marimbas arranged by the Japanese percussionist Kuniko in which one live marimba plays against five pre-recorded marimbas. A recorded version was included in her 2010 album of Reich pieces, Kuniko Plays Reich. Piano Counterpoint is an arrangement of Six Pianos by the pianist Vincent Corver, following the format of Reich's Counterpoint series in which one live instrument plays against pre- recorded versions of the same instrument. This arrangement has four pre- recorded parts and one solo part, combining the two foreground melodic parts of Six Pianos. Piano Counterpoint's sonic difference from the original comes from the use of amplification and from the solo part in which some of the melodic phrases are an octave higher. Corver created this arrangement in 2011. Piano Counterpoint is performed by Corver himself on an album released by the London Steve Reich Ensemble in 2011 and by Vicky Chow (known as pianist in the Bang on a Can All Stars) in an album released in 2014. Chow played the piece at a somewhat slower tempo to give a different feel to Corver's version. Folkwang University of the Arts professor Mie Miki adapted the piece for accordions: the resulting Six Accordions premi√®red in Tokyo in 2010. American DJ Kerri Chandler released a house-music track called Six Pianos that interpolates the Reich piece. Recordings The original version of the piece was recorded in Hamburg (Rahlstedt), Musikstudio 1, in January 1974.

He was responsible for some of the most innovative work on tunnels and bridges in the United Kingdom in the 40-year period centred on World War I. Early career Basil Mott was born in Leicester on 16 September 1859. He was educated at the International School, Switzerland and at the Royal School of Mines where he won the Murchison medal in 1879. He was first employed as a mining engineer with the Neston Colliery Co. in Cheshire but in 1886 was invited by J H Greathead to join the staff of the City & South London Railway (C&SLR;), for which Greathead was Engineer. His work on the C&SLR; gave him a taste for underground construction works that influenced the remaining 40 years of his professional life. He did well at the C&SLR; and was promoted, first to resident engineer (RE) for the extension of the C&SLR; from Stockwell to Clapham, then to RE for the entire line. After the railway opened in 1890, he was retained as Engineer by the operating company: this gave him the opportunity to develop techniques for carrying out reconstruction works during overnight possessions of the tunnels, techniques which are still used on LU today. Shortly after Greathead's death in October 1896, Benjamin Baker formed a partnership with Mott for the design of the Central London Railway. Their association continued with the extensions and rebuilding on the C&SLR; (including the underpinning of St Mary Woolnoth church at Bank) and the widening of Blackfriars Bridge. They worked from the same offices until Baker's death in 1907. Mott, Hay and Anderson 1n 1902, Mott formed what turned out to be a lifelong partnership with another prot√©g√© of Baker's, David Hay. Subsequently, the partnership of Mott and Hay (now Mott MacDonald) worked on extending the Central London Railway, the building of escalators in London Underground and the construction of the Tyne and Southwark Bridges. It also designed the underpinning required to stabilise Clifford's Tower in York. During the first world war, Basil Mott visited France and India, advising the government on solving engineering problems. He was created a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1918 in recognition of these services. The Mersey Tunnel, which he worked on between 1922 and 1934, is his most well-known work. From the outset, it was designed on a large scale; it is still the longest, widest road tunnel in Great Britain. Basil Mott was Engineer for the works, in association with J. A. Brodie, Engineer for the City of Liverpool. His partnership (by then named Mott, Hay and Anderson) designed and supervised the construction of the Mersey Tunnel in its entirety. In 1924, he was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1926 he was hired by Southampton council to investigate the various options for building a fixed crossing across the lower River Itchen. Along with proving costs for a tunnel and a high level crossing he recommended a low level opening span bridge. Basil Mott's other post-WW1 works include the extension to Morden of the Northern line, the enlargement of the original C&SLR; tunnels from 10' 6\\" to 11' 8\\" (using a tunnelling shield which could be worked at night but through which trains could drive during the day), the Jubilee Bridge and work on the Tees Newport Bridge. In 1930, aged 71, he gave evidence to a British government inquiry on the engineering aspects of a proposed Channel Tunnel (which was not built, though Mott, Hay and Anderson designed the bulk of the successful scheme for Channel Tunnel half a century later). In the same year he was created a baronet. In May 1932 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society‚Äîa rare honour for a civil engineer. He died on 7 September 1938, in London. The baronetcy is currently held by his grandson, John Mott.

At the 2006 census, its population was 72,218, in 19,419 families. It is located south of Hamadan, east of Malayer and northwest of Borujerd. Occupied since prehistoric times, Nahavand was bestowed upon the House of Karen in the Sasanian period. During the Arab conquest of Iran, it was the site of the famous Battle of Nahavand.  Name  The name NahƒÅvand is probably ultimately derived from Old Persian *NiŒ∏ƒÅvanta-, related to the Old Persian name NisƒÅya, itself derived from the prefix ni-, meaning \\"down\\" and a second element which is related to Avestan si or say, meaning \\"to lie down\\". It has been spelled differently in different books and sources: Nahavand, Nahavend, Nahawand, Nahaavand, Nihavand, Nehavand, Nihavend, or Nehavend, formerly called Mah-Nahavand, and in antiquity Laodicea (; Arabic Ladhiqiyya), also transliterated Laodiceia and Laodikeia, Laodicea in Media, Laodicea in Persis, Antiochia in Persis, Antiochia of Chosroes (), Antiochia in Media (), Nemavand and Niphaunda. Geography Nahavand is located in western Iran, in the northern part of the Zagros region. It lies kilometers south of Hamadan, from which it is separated by the massif of the Alvand subrange. This massif grants Nahavand and its hinterlands an abundant water supply. Historically, Nahavand was located on a route that led from central Iraq through Kermanshah to northern Iran, and was therefore often crossed by armies. Another historic road, coming from Kermanshah, leads towards Isfahan in central Iran and avoids the Alvand massif. Nahavand also lies on the branch of the Gamasab river which comes from the southeast from the vicinity of Borujerd; from Nahavand the Gamasab river flows westwards to Mount Behistun. Given Nahavand's location, it was the site of several battles, and was considered important in Iranian history during Iran's wars with its western neighbors. Prehistory Excavations conducted in 1931/2 at Tepe Giyan by Georges Contenau and Roman Ghirshman led to the conclusion that Nahavand and its environs have been inhabited since prehistoric times. It showed that the site of Tepe Giyan, which lies kilometers southeast of Nahavand, was occupied from at least 5,000 BC to BC. History Clasp with an eagle and its prey found in Nahavand, believed by Ernst Herzfeld to originally belong to the House of Karen. Nahavand Castle by Eug√®ne Flandin (19th century drawing) Giyan Spring Faresban Spring During the Achaemenid period (550‚Äì330 BC), Nahavand was located in the southernmost part of Media, on the fertile Nisaean plain. The ancient geographer and historian Strabo wrote that it was \\"(re-)founded\\" by Achaemenid King Xerxes the Great (486‚Äì465 BC). It lay kilometers from Ecbatana (modern-day Hamadan), on the trunk road from Babylonia through Media to Bactria. In the Seleucid period, Nahavand was turned into a Greek polis with magistrates and a Seleucid governor. In the 20th century, a stone stele was found near Nahavand. The stele bore an inscription of Seleucid ruler Antiochus III the Great (222‚Äì187 BC), introducing the cult he had created for his wife Queen Laodice III. The stele, dated to 193 BC, revealed the terminus ante quem of the foundation of the Greek polis. According to the polymath Abu Hanifa Dinawari, who flourished in the 9th century, in the Parthian period, Nahavand was the seat of the Parthian prince Artabanus, who later reigned as Artabanus I of Parthia (127-124/3 BC). During the Sasanian period, the district of Nahavand was bestowed upon the House of Karen. There was also a fire temple. In 642, during the Arab conquest of Iran, a famous battle was fought at Nahavand. With heavy losses on both sides, it eventually resulted in a Sasanian defeat, and as such, opened up the doors of the Iranian plateau to the invaders. In the early Islamic period, Nahavand flourished as part of the province of Jibal. It first functioned as administrative center of the Mah al-Basra (\\"Media of the Basrans\\") district. Its revenues were reportedly used for the payment of the troops from Basra that were stationed in Nahavand. Medieval geographers mention Nahavand as an affluent commercial hub with two Friday mosques. When the 10th century Arab traveller Abu Dulaf travelled through Nahavand he noted \\"fine remains of the [ancient] Persians\\". Abu Dulaf also wrote that during the reign of Caliph al- Ma'mun (813‚Äì833), a treasure chamber had been found, containing two gold caskets. In the course of the subsequent centuries, only few events in Nahavand were recorded. The Persian vizier of the Seljuk Empire, Nizam al- Mulk, was assassinated in 1092 near Nahavand. According to the historian and geographer Hamdallah Mustawfi, who flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries, Nahavand was a town of medium size surrounded by fertile fields where corn, cotton and fruits were grown. Mustawfi added that its inhabitants were mainly Twelver Shia Kurds. In 1589, during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590, Ottoman General Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha built a fortress at Nahavand for future campaigns against Safavid Iran. By the Treaty of Constantinople (1590), the Safavids were forced to cede the city to the Turks. In 1602/3, Nahavand's citizens revolted against the Ottoman occupiers. Coinciding with the Celali revolts in Anatolia, the Safavids recaptured Nahavand and expelled the Ottomans from the city, thus restoring Iranian control. The Safavid governor of Hamadan, Hasan Khan Ustajlu, subsequently destroyed the Ottoman fort. In the wake of the collapse of the Safavids in 1722, the Turks captured Nahavand once more. In 1730, they were ousted by Nader-Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah; 1736‚Äì1747). Nader's death in 1747 led to instability. Over the next few years, Nahavand was exploited by local Bakhtiari chiefs. In , Karim Khan Zand defeated the Bakhtiari chieftain Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari at Nahavand.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The brand was originally named for the seaport of Newport, Rhode Island. It is the best-selling brand of menthols in the world. History Newport was originally launched in 1957 by the Lorillard Tobacco Company. The cigarette originated within Ireland and was introduced to the culture mostly for the male drinkers of the time. The spinnaker present on all packs since the late 1950s is meant to capitalize on the association with sailing. The original Newport had a white filter and a hint of mint; both were gone in 1969 and thus the white filter was replaced by a standard filter. The Newport Classic full flavor cigarettes were promoted for many years as a cigarette that allows you to \\"Enjoy a full flavor menthol, without drowning out pure tobacco taste\\". In the mid-1980s, Newport began an advertising campaign that targeted African Americans in urban areas. In two years, Newport became the fifth most popular cigarette on the market.IDEAS & TRENDS; Understanding the Dream World of Cigarette Ads. The New York Times. 24 April 1988. Because of this, Newports have gained a commanding share of the African-American market; a 2005 survey stated that 49.5% of all cigarette sales to African-Americans were Newport cigarettes. Newport has been the second best selling cigarette brand in the United States since 1996, trailing only Altria's Marlboro brand. A 2004 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the percentage of teen Newport smokers doubled between 1989 and 1996. Researcher Karen Gerlach indicated that Newports made the most significant progress with the Hispanic and White American teen markets in those years.Newport cigarettes gain popularity among teens. Biotech Week. 25 Feb. 2004. A 1998 Massachusetts Department of Public Health report indicated that Newports alongside unfiltered Camel cigarettes contained the highest levels of nicotine in cigarettes on the market. In the following six years, Lorillard Tobacco increased the amount of nicotine in Newports by 10%. In 2015, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company acquired Newport and the entire Lorillard Tobacco Company for $27.4 billion. Newports comprise about 35 percent of menthol cigarette sales in the U.S.Newport cigarette maker Lorillard's CEO Martin Orlowsky talks about FDA's menthol study. The Associated Press. 8 Feb. 2010. It has been the most popular mentholated cigarette brand sold in the United States since 1993. Advertisement Lorillard advertised Newport in various ways. TV advertisements were created in the 1960s and 1970s to promote the brand. Once TV adverts were banned in the United States, Lorillard advertised the brand through poster advertisements. The Newport ads in this theme range from 1980 to present day and feature the \\"Newport Pleasure\\" or \\"Alive with Pleasure\\" campaign slogans. The latter slogan provides the viewer with a subconscious health claim. Additionally, the pleasure aspect of these campaigns weighs an important part of youth targeting, portraying Newports as fun and enjoyable and, subconsciously, sexy and sexual. Markets Newport is mainly sold in the United States, but also was or still is sold in Antigua, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Finland and Singapore.

Boston Globe. 11 June 2013. =Newport and targeting of African- Americans= In the 1960s, Lorillard specifically targeted African Americans to sell Newport cigarettes. Lorillard increased its African American market budget by 87% over 1968 due to increased efforts marketing its menthol cigarette, Newport, to the African American market. Government surveys in 2011 revealed that menthol cigarettes dominated 30% of the overall market, and over 80% of black smokers prefer menthol as opposed to 22% of non-Hispanic white smokers. In 2016, it was reported that Newport was the brand of choice for nearly 60% of black smokers. =Newport and targeting teenagers= In September 2016, it was reported that R.J. Reynolds was specifically targeting black teenagers and young adults to sell Newport cigarettes. Reynolds American Inc., the parent firm that owns Newport, was pushing the brand on people in their 20s ‚Äî with pop-ups at music festivals like Las Vegas' Electric Daisy Carnival, a notorious destination for teen-partiers, which was recently pressured to raise its age requirements. Dubbed \\"Newport Pleasure Lounges\\", the air-conditioned party trucks were replete with games like digital darts. Newports could be purchased in these lounges for $1 per pack. Reynolds had set aside $50 million for such initiatives in 2016. A study from the Stanford University School of Medicine had discovered that menthol cigarette manufacturers created very direct marketing campaigns designed to attract young black smokers. Far from being a catchall effort, Reuters says these campaigns were concerted attacks on African-American teens: \\"A recent analysis of the data found school neighborhoods were increasingly likely to have lower prices and more advertising for Newport cigarettes as the proportion of African-American students rose. The same was true of neighborhoods with higher proportions of children aged 10 to 17.\\" =Newport, Nike, and plagiarism= In May 2010, a report was written where the popular sport shoe company Nike copied the Swoosh logo from Newport. The comparison was made, because Newport was introduced in 1957 and used a logo they call the \\"spinnaker\\", while Nike was formed on January 25, 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Philip Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. in 1978. The Nike swoosh is a logo design created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson, over a decade after Newport cigarettes were launched. Despite some claims, no specific evidence has ever been found that Nike stole the logo from Newport. In 2006, Lorillard and Nike sued graphic designer Ari Saal Forman after he released his Ari Menthol 10s shoes, which combined the design of the Nike Air Force 1 with Newport's spinnaker and colors. According to Forman, the shoes were \\"dedicated to the two brands who have taken the most and given the least.\\" As a result of the lawsuit, Forman is not legally allowed to own a pair of Menthol 10s. =Newport marijuana cigarettes= In December 2016, it was reported that R.J. Reynolds would start selling marijuana cigarettes called \\"Newport Nirvana\\". However, Newport did not develop marijuana cigarettes which would be available for purchase in 2017. In November 2016, a site called TMZWorldNews published an article reporting that the cigarette brand Newport planned to introduce marijuana cigarettes dubbed the \\"Newport Nirvana\\". However, Snopes reported that TMZWorldNews is a fake news website appropriating the combined brandings of popular gossip site TMZ and the national newscast ABC World News Tonight. None included a disclaimer warning readers its content consisted entirely of falsehoods. Varieties A soft pack of Newport Menthol cigarettes A pack of Newport Non-Menthol (Red), king size box Surgeon General Cigarette Warning Newport cigarettes come in several varieties: Full Flavor, Medium, and Lights. In the United States, in June 2010, \\"Medium\\" and \\"Lights\\" were re-branded into \\"Blue\\" and \\"Gold\\" respectively. On the box, the words \\"Menthol Box\\" for shorts and \\"Menthol Box 100s\\" for 100s were replaced simply with \\"Cigarettes.\\" Each variety is sold in 85mm soft packs (king size), 80mm hard packs (box), and 100mm soft and hard packs. They are available in standard packs of 20 cigarettes, as well as the more unusual 25s, containing 25 cigarettes. Prior to the signing of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in the late 1990s, they were sold in packs of ten as well. Due to the FDA Tobacco Regulations, the terms \\"Full Flavor,\\" \\"Medium,\\" \\"Light,\\" \\"Mild\\" and \\"Ultra Light\\" have been discontinued. New names for Newport Cigarettes are as follows: * Newport Box (Full Flavor) * Newport Box 100s (Full Flavor 100s) * Newport Smooth Select (Full Flavor) * Newport Smooth Select 100s (Full Flavor 100s) * Newport Menthol Blue (Medium) * Newport Menthol Blue 100s (Medium 100s) * Newport Menthol Gold (Light) * Newport Menthol Gold 100s (Light 100s) * Newport Non- Menthol * Newport Non-Menthol 100s * Newport Non-Menthol Gold * Newport Non- Menthol Gold 100s * Newport Platinum Blue * Newport Platinum Blue 100s * Newport Platinum Silver * Newport Platinum Silver 100s Non-menthol Newports in Full Flavor and Lights were sold in United States during the mid- to late 1990s, possibly as late as 2002; however, they were discontinued until November 2010 in which they re-released them in order to keep up with the non- menthol cigarette smokers in America. The packs are identical in design to standard menthol Newports except the turquoise-colored area is red on the Full Flavors and mustard-yellow on the Lights. Newport Slim 120s (introduced 1998), Newport \\"Stripes\\" and Newport \\"M-Blend\\" were other varieties that have also been discontinued. In some Latin American markets, such as tourist areas of the Dominican Republic, British American Tobacco has released some limited edition varieties and outer packagings including: * Newport Silver (menthol ultra lights) * Newport Freezing Point (10 & 20 count boxes) * Newport Midnight Blast In July 2017, R.J. Reynolds announced they would introduce new flavors called Newport Platinum. It would be released in two variants: Newport Platinum (King Size and 100s) and Newport Platinum Blue (also King Size and 100s).

He gained fame as an actor in The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash, a spoof on the actual history of The Beatles in which he also performed as a member of The Rutles. He is also known for his stint as a member of The Beach Boys between 1971 and 1974. Fataar may also be recognized for his contributions as a record producer, and has worked on projects scoring music to film and television. Music career =The Flames= Fataar's first childhood band was The Flames, a band from his birthplace of Durban, South Africa that began in 1963. He joined the band at the age of nine. The band made several recordings as well as touring all over Southern Africa and before long they became quite popular in South Africa. By the time he was twelve years old he had already won the honour of being voted as the \\"Best Rock Drummer in South Africa.\\" In 1968 the band moved to London and began touring in the United Kingdom. On one of their tours, they were spotted by a founding member of The Beach Boys, Carl Wilson. He was impressed by their talent and offered to sign them to the Beach Boys new record label, Brother Records.Fataar Biography The band moved to Los Angeles, United States, and they recorded and released their 1970 album The Flame with Carl Wilson producing the album. =The Beach Boys= The Flames disbanded in late 1970, and Fataar and his former Flame bandmate Blondie Chaplin were recruited by The Beach Boys, in March 1972. Fataar was asked to play drums for the band after drummer Dennis Wilson suffered a debilitating hand accident. The duo recorded two albums with the Beach Boys, and began touring with them in 1971. The 1972 Beach Boys album Carl and the Passions ‚Äì \\"So Tough\\" featured musical and vocal contributions from Chaplin and Fataar. It also included two songs written by the duo, \\"Here She Comes\\" and \\"Hold On Dear Brother\\". On the band's next album, Holland, released a year later, both musicians recorded, and provided backing vocals, including the hit single \\"Sail On, Sailor\\", on which Chaplin sang as lead vocalist. They additionally collaborated with Carl Wilson and Mike Love on the song \\"Leaving This Town\\". 1973 saw the first live album The Beach Boys in Concert, upon which Fataar performed. It featured a live version of the previously unreleased Chaplin/Fataar/Love collaboration \\"We Got Love\\", which was originally intended to be released on the Holland album, but was removed from the running order to make way for single \\"Sail On, Sailor\\". Both Fataar and Chaplin would later depart the band, with Fataar only appearing on the tracks \\"It's OK\\" and \\"That Same Song\\" off the Beach Boys' next studio album, 1976's 15 Big Ones. Fataar is also credited as having played on the 1980 album Keepin' the Summer Alive. In March 2019, Big Noise's Al Gomes and Connie Watrous presented a plaque from Roger Williams University to Fataar in Providence, RI at a sold-out Bonnie Raitt / James Taylor concert. The plaque commemorates The Beach Boys' September 22, 1971 concert at The Ramada Inn in Portsmouth, RI, now Roger Williams University's Baypoint Inn & Conference Center. The concert was a very significant historic event in The Beach Boys' career ‚Äì it was the very first time Fataar played on-stage as a new member of The Beach Boys, which then led to Chaplin joining the band, and essentially changed The Beach Boys' live and recording act's line-up into a multi-cultural group. =The Rutles= In 1978, Fataar starred in All You Need Is Cash, a mockumentary film known more commonly as The Rutles, a spoof on the real life history of The Beatles, which had a follow up to a Saturday Night Live television sketch. The Beatlesque music for the Rutles was written by Neil Innes, formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo- Dah Band and musical collaborator with Monty Python. Fataar's character was Stig O'Hara, the band's guitarist (analogous to George Harrison). He speaks no dialogue in the film, and indeed is sent up as \\"the quiet one\\" in it. Fataar's then wife, Penelope Tree, also appeared in All You Need Is Cash, as Stig's wife, Penelope. Fataar was less than quiet on the two albums produced by The Rutles, The Rutles and Archeology, which featured him playing guitar, bass, sitar, drums, and singing. He would also go on to record a single with Eric Idle as 'Dirk & Stig' titled, \\"Mr. Sheene\\" / \\"Ging Gang Goolie\\".  Collaborations  With Bonnie Raitt * Green Light (Warner Bros.

Other common names include purple secretia, purple-heart, and purple queen. It is native to the Gulf Coast region of eastern Mexico. Edward Palmer collected the type specimen near Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas in 1907. Names The Latin specific epithet pallida means \\"pale\\". Description Tradescantia pallida is an evergreen perennial plant of scrambling stature. It is distinguished by elongated, pointed leaves - themselves glaucous green, fringed with red or purple - and bearing small, sterile three-petaled flowers of white, pink or purple. Plants are top-killed by moderate frosts, but will often sprout back from roots. Cultivation Widely used as an ornamental plant in gardens and borders, as a ground cover, hanging plant, or - particularly in colder climates where it cannot survive the winter season - houseplant, it is propagated easily by cuttings (the stems are visibly segmented and roots will frequently grow from the joints). As a houseplant, T. pallida has been judged exceptionally effective at improving indoor air quality by filtering out volatile organic compounds, a class of common pollutants and respiratory irritants, an effect known as phytoremediation.Yang, Dong Sik, Pennisi, Svoboda V., Son, Ki-Cheol, Kays, Stanley J.

It is one of two Anglican churches in the town, the other being Holy Trinity. All Saints has existed since Norman times and it is set in the oldest part of the town, near to where the River Aire is crossed by Ireland Bridge. History The history of the church probably dates back to pre-Norman times. It is thought that there might have been a wooden church on this location for many years prior to the Norman conquest, although no records exist. The first records of the church indicate it was rebuilt some time after 1066 by the Lord of the Manor, William Paganel, who gave it, with other possessions of his, to Drax Priory in the time of Archbishop Thurstan (1119‚Äì1140). This building was probably rebuilt many times over the centuries, culminating in the present structure, which was begun during the reign of Henry VIII (1491‚Äì1547). The choir was erected in 1518, when the church was dedicated to All Saints, having previously been dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The current tower was constructed in the 15th century and heightened with a new belfry added in 1739. The two-light bell openings that adorn each side of the tower were 19th century additions. The church received a new clock in 1856 and was renovated in 1870-1871 when the Ferrand Chapel became the vestry and some of the pews that were tied to the local Manor Houses were stripped out. The church has a stained-glass window crafted by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. There is a peal of bells, for many years six in number, with a further two added in 1873. In 1904, a new road was built to the east of the church and cut the churchyard in two. Several gravestones were used to make paths from the exhumed graves. One gravestone that was lost was that of John Nicholson, a poet who had been buried in the churchyard in April 1843. The church was Grade II* listed in 1966. The two gate piers to the south of the church that lead onto the Old Main Street in Bingley, were grade II listed in 1985. The church's setting is in the oldest part of the town that used to have a school and possibly a castle. The Old White Horse Inn and Ireland Bridge are both nearby, and the Old Main Street is still laid out with cobbled stone setts. The parish includes the churches of St. Aidan, Crossflatts and St. Lawrence, Eldwick and is part of the Bingley Group Ministry which includes Holy Trinity Church and St Wilfreds in Gilstead. The benefice used to lie within the Diocese of Bradford, but since 20 April 2014 it is now in the Diocese of Leeds. In October 2018, a special service with the Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, was held to celebrate 500 years of worship at the church.

Description Klein Cura√ßao has a desert climate (in the K√∂ppen climate classification BWh and BWk), a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation. The only structures on the island are an old lighthouse, a beach house, and several huts. Klein Cura√ßao is well known as a beautiful diving spot because of its coral and underwater caves. The island has no permanent inhabitants, only a few palm-frond covered sheds for day trippers from Cura√ßao, and apart from some coconut palms has little vegetation. There are some fishermen's huts where fishermen normally stay for some days. They get water from the Coast Guard of Cura√ßao. The windward side is a graveyard for boats that did not stay out far enough or lost power. A small tanker, the Maria Bianca Guidesman, is gradually being demolished by the constant pounding of the waves since 1988.Bianca Marie (Fundaci√≥n Histarmar ‚àí Historia y Arqueolog√≠a Mar√≠tima, Retrieved 11 May 2020.) The remains of another four or five boats have been washed far onshore. As with Cura√ßao, hurricanes are few, but several storms have left their mark; the 1877 hurricane destroyed the first lighthouse. The next lighthouse, which still survives, was built in the interior of the island. History The island played a part in the slave trade. The Dutch West India Company brought many slaves from Africa to Cura√ßao. Before these slaves came ashore in Cura√ßao, the sick were placed in quarantine at Klein Cura√ßao. The remains of this first quarantine building can still be found in the northwest of the island. The slaves, and other passengers who did not survive the voyage, were buried at Klein Cura√ßao. There are several graves in the southern part of the island. The Dutch West India Company were also given licenses to hunt the now extinct Caribbean monk seals on Klein Cura√ßao. In 1871, John Godden, an English mining engineer, visited the island, discovering there was a significant vein of phosphate on the island. From 1871 onwards until 1886, the Dutch government set up mining operations on the island, with phosphate being mined and exported to Europe. Environment Once the phosphate was mined out, the level of the island dropped, and seabird populations plummeted. Goats were once allowed to roam the island, which contributed to its desertification. The goats were eradicated in 1996, as were feral cats by 2004. Reforestation is being undertaken by CARMABI Marine Research Station, Cura√ßao. The island was designated as a protected Ramsar site in 2018. It has also been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International as a nesting site for least terns, while its shores are used seasonally by large numbers of migratory waders. With the elimination of the goats and cats, the island has the potential to become an important seabird nesting location. Hawksbill, loggerhead and green sea turtles nest on the island's beaches.

It is a conversion of the Intellivision cartridge Frog Bog released earlier that year. In both games, each player controls a frog sitting on a lily pad, attempting to eat more flies than the other. Frogs and Flies is similar to the 1978 Sega-Gremlin arcade game Frogs. Gameplay Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen ‚Äì the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \\"The End\\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner. There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water ‚Äì in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad. Versions Mattel released the game for its Intellivision with the name Frog Bog, and an Atari 2600 version under its M Network label with the name Frogs and Flies. An updated version of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the Intellivision Amico.

Gillick competence is a term originating in England and is used in medical law to decide whether a child (under 16 years of age) is able to consent to their own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge. The standard is based on the 1985 decision of the House of Lords in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority. The case is binding in England and Wales, and has been adopted to varying extents in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Similar provision is made in Scotland by the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991. In Northern Ireland, although separate legislation applies, the then Department of Health and Social Services stated that there was no reason to suppose that the House of Lords' decision would not be followed by the Northern Ireland Courts. The Gillick decision The Gillick case involved a health departmental circular advising doctors on the contraception of minors (for this purpose, under sixteens). The circular stated that the prescription of contraception was a matter for the doctor's discretion and that they could be prescribed to under sixteens without parental consent. This matter was litigated because an activist, Victoria Gillick, ran an active campaign against the policy. Gillick sought a declaration that prescribing contraception was illegal because the doctor would commit an offence of encouraging sex with a minor and that it would be treatment without consent as consent vested in the parent; she was unsuccessful before the High Court, but succeeded in the Court of Appeal. The issue before the House of Lords was only whether the minor involved could give consent. \\"Consent\\" here was considered in the broad sense of consent to battery or assault: in the absence of patient consent to treatment, a doctor, even if well-intentioned, might be sued/charged. The House of Lords focused on the issue of consent rather than a notion of 'parental rights' or parental power. In fact, the court held that 'parental rights' did not exist, other than to safeguard the best interests of a minor. The majority held that in some circumstances a minor could consent to treatment, and that in these circumstances a parent had no power to veto treatment. Lord Scarman and Lord Fraser proposed slightly different tests (Lord Bridge agreed with both). Lord Scarman's test is generally considered to be the test of 'Gillick competency'. He required that a child could consent if he or she fully understood the medical treatment that is proposed: The ruling holds particularly significant implications for the legal rights of minor children in England in that it is broader in scope than merely medical consent. It lays down that the authority of parents to make decisions for their minor children is not absolute, but diminishes with the child's evolving maturity. The result of Gillick is that in England today, except in situations that are regulated otherwise by law, the legal right to make a decision on any particular matter concerning the child shifts from the parent to the child when the child reaches sufficient maturity to be capable of making up his or her own mind on the matter requiring decision. Subsequent developments The decisions In re R (1991) and Re W (1992) (especially Lord Donaldson) contradict the Gillick decision somewhat. From these, and subsequent cases, it is suggested that although the parental right to veto treatment ends, parental powers do not \\"terminate\\" as suggested by Lord Scarman in Gillick. However, these are only obiter statements and were made by a lower court; therefore, they are not legally binding. However, the parens patriae jurisdiction of the court remains available allowing a court order to force treatment against a child's (and parent's) wishes. A child who is deemed \\"Gillick competent\\" is able to prevent their parents viewing their medical records. As such, medical staff will not make a disclosure of medical records of a child who is deemed \\"Gillick competent\\" unless consent is manifest. In a 2006 judicial review, R (on the application of Axon) v Secretary of State for Health,[2006 EWHC 37 (Admin)] the High Court affirmed Gillick in allowing for medical confidentiality for teenagers seeking an abortion. The court rejected a claim that not granting parent's a \\"right to know\\" whether their child had sought an abortion, birth control or contraception breached Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Axon case set out a list of criteria that a doctor must meet when deciding whether to provide treatment to an under-16 child without informing their parents: they must be convinced that they can understand all aspects of the advice, that the patient's physical or mental health is likely to suffer without medical advice, that it is in the best interests of the patient to provide medical advice, that (in provision of contraception) they are likely to have sex whether contraception is provided or not, and that they have made an effort to convince the young person to disclose the information to their parents. In most jurisdictions the parent of an emancipated minor does not have the ability to consent to therapy, regardless of the Gillick test. Typical positions of emancipation arise when the minor is married (R v D [1984] AC 778, 791) or in the military. The nature of the standard remains uncertain. The courts have so far declined invitations to define rigidly \\"Gillick competence\\" and the individual doctor is free to make a decision, consulting peers if this may be helpful, as to whether that child is \\"Gillick competent\\". Some recent legislation appears to explicitly restrict the ability of Gillick competent children to consent to medical treatment outside of clinical settings. For example, parental consent is required for the treatment of children with asthma using standby salbutamol inhalers in schools. These restrictions have yet to be tested in court. Australian law The Australian High Court gave specific and strong approval for the Gillick decision in \\"Marion's Case\\", Secretary of the Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB (1992) 175 CLR 189. The Gillick competence doctrine is part of Australian case law (see, e.g., DoCS v Y [1999] NSWSC 644). There is no express authority in Australia on In re R and Re W, so whether a parent's right terminates is unclear. This lack of authority reflects that the reported cases have all involved minors who have been found to be incompetent, and that Australian courts will make decisions in the parens patriae jurisdiction regardless of Gillick competence. In South Australia and New South Wales legislation clarifies the common law, establishing a Gillick-esque standard of competence but preserving concurrent consent between parent and child for the ages 14‚Äì16.  Confusion regarding Gillick competence  On 21 May 2009, confusion arose between Gillick competence, which identifies under-16s with the capacity to consent to their own treatment, and the Fraser guidelines, which are concerned only with contraception and focus on the desirability of parental involvement and the risks of unprotected sex in that area. A persistent rumour arose that Victoria Gillick disliked having her name associated with the assessment of children's capacity, but an editorial in the BMJ from 2006 claimed that Gillick said that she \\"has never suggested to anyone, publicly or privately, that [she] disliked being associated with the term 'Gillick competent. Fraser guidelines It is lawful for doctors to provide contraceptive advice and treatment without parental consent providing certain criteria are met. These criteria, known as the Fraser guidelines, were laid down by Lord Fraser in the House of Lords' case and require the professional to be satisfied that: *the young person will understand the professional's advice; *the young person cannot be persuaded to inform their parents; *the young person is likely to begin, or to continue having, sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment; *unless the young person receives contraceptive treatment, their physical or mental health, or both, are likely to suffer; *the young person's best interests require them to receive contraceptive advice or treatment with or without parental consent. Although these criteria specifically refer to contraception, the principles are deemed to apply to other treatments, including abortion. Although the judgement in the House of Lords referred specifically to doctors, it is considered to apply to other health professionals, including nurses. It may also be interpreted as covering youth workers and health promotion workers who may be giving contraceptive advice and condoms to young people under 16, but this has not been tested in court. If a person under the age of 18 refuses to consent to treatment, it is possible in some cases for their parents or the courts to overrule their decision. However, this right can be exercised only on the basis that the welfare of the young person is paramount. In this context, welfare does not simply mean their physical health. The psychological effect of having the decision overruled would have to be taken into account and would normally be an option only when the young person was thought likely to suffer \\"grave and irreversible mental or physical harm\\". Usually, when a parent wants to overrule a young person's decision to refuse treatment, health professionals will apply to the courts for a final decision. An interesting aside to the Fraser guidelines is that many regard Lord Scarman's judgement as the leading judgement in the case, but because Lord Fraser's judgement was shorter and set out in more specific terms ‚Äì and in that sense more accessible to health and welfare professionals ‚Äì it is his judgement that has been reproduced as containing the core principles.

Stone axes, so-called thunderstones (ukonvaaja in Finnish), were found in the ground, especially after drenching rains washed away dirt.

Basic structure  The novel concerns World War I, the existence pilots lead and the fear involved in flying early biplanes. Its protagonist, Tom Cundall, plans to leave the Royal Air Force when his service is up and live on a West Country farm with his friends. However, by the time he is due to leave the Air Force, all his friends have \\"gone west\\". This leaves him a broken man. The narrative combination of action, pathos, humour and humility set against the huge casualties of the RAF in 1918 makes Winged Victory one of the classics of Great War literature. The book is semi- autobiographical, V. M. Yeates having served with 46 Squadron flying Sopwith Camels in 1918 and also having lost all his friends in the war. T. E. Lawrence praised it on its release with the words \\"Admirable, admirable, admirable. One of the most distinguished histories of the war ... masterly\\". However, it went out of print due to a lack of a publisher and was soon forgotten. Yeates died in 1934 from tuberculosis. It had a resurgence in popularity with RAF pilots during World War II because of its accurate descriptions of air warfare. The book was reissued with a new preface and a tribute by Henry Williamson in 1961 (it was Williamson who encouraged Yeates to complete the book after World War I). It was reprinted in 1972 in paperback by Richard Clay (The Chaucer Press) Ltd., and republished in paperback in 2004. Yeates wrote in the flyleaf of Williamson's copy of Winged Victory that: \\"I started [writing the book] in April 1933 in Colindale Hospital. I could not write there, so walked out one morning, the doctor threatening death. I wrote daily till the end of the year. My chief difficulty was to compromise between truth and art, for I was writing a novel that was to be an exact reproduction of the period and an exact analysis and synthesis of a state of mind.\\"Williamson, Henry \\"Tribute to V. M. Yeates\\", in Pilot's view from cockpit of Sopwith Camel.  Descriptions of aerial combat  Winged Victory is remarkable for its depictions of World War I aerial combat. \\"They flew over the ghastly remains of Villers-Bretonneux which were still being tortured by bursting shells upspurting in columns of smoke and debris that stood solid for a second and then floated fading away in the wind. All along the line from Hamel to Hangard Wood the whiter puff-balls of shrapnel were appearing and fading multitudinously and incessantly ... A flaming meteor fell out of a cloud close by them and plunged earthwards. It was an aeroplane going down in flames from some fight above the clouds. Where it fell the atmosphere was stained by a thanatognomonic black streak ... Tom sitting there in the noise and the hard wind had the citied massy earth his servant tumbler, waiting upon his touch of stick or rudder for its guidance; instantly responding, ready to leap and frisk a lamb-planet amid the steady sun-bound sheep ... Some of the cloud peaks thrust up to ten thousand feet; in the blue fields beyond there was an occasional flash of a tilting wing reflecting the sun. Mac climbed as fast as he could. In a few minutes they were at ten thousand, and the Huns, a mile above them, were discernable as aeroplanes, bluely translucent ... Rattle of guns and flash of tracers and the Fokker in a vertical turn, red, with extension on the top planes. Tom hated those extensions. He was doing a very splitarse turn for a Hun, but tracers seemed to be finding him. Got him, oh got him: over, flopping over, nose dropping, spinning.\\"  Philosophy about war  In Winged Victory some characters offer a prescient and pessimistic view of the causes of war, far removed from the jingoism of many of Yeates' contemporary writers: \\"For there's one thing financiers cannot or will not see. They have visions of a frontierless world in which their operations will proceed without hindrance and make all human activities dependent on them; but their world is impossible because finance is sterile, and a state living by finance must always have neighbours from which to suck blood, or it is like a dog eating its own tail...an intense war-fever inoculation was carried out by the press. It took rather less than three months, I believe, to make the popular demand for war irresistible...There'll be a famous orgy of money snatching over our bones.\\" Other characters express contrary sentiments - the above argument is rendered a \\"bitter snarl\\" by another. Above all, Yeates reproduces the typical arguments of a 1918 RFC mess, and we see the characters portraying a wide and complex range of views about the war.  Challenging of perceptions of the War in the Air  One of the most notable things about Winged Victory is how it challenges the common perception of the war in the air during the First World War, especially when compared with other contemporary fiction. Unlike most other \\"air\\" novels of the time (e.g. Biggles ), it fits neatly into the canon of so-called \\"Disenchantment\\" novels, which while well regarded in the present day, were largely ignored. While it acknowledges that there are high scoring aces, who seem invulnerable (notably the character of \\"Mac\\"), most of the characters find the war interminably unpleasant, alternatively horrid and dull, enlivened only by regular nihilistic drinking binges. Equally, it acknowledges the serious flaws in allied aircraft by 1918. While many more modern sources (including Wikipedia) list the Sopwith Camel as an excellent, almost unsurpassed aircraft, Yeates, via Cundall, complains that it was too slow, and could not climb high enough - flaws so serious that Cundall's squadron is regularly assigned to ground attack, being covered by SE5as. The desired aircraft is neither the Camel, not its replacements the Sopwith Snipe or Sopwith Salamander (wrongly assumed by Cundall to be a new fighter variant instead of a ground attack aircraft), but instead the all-but forgotten high flying Sopwith Dolphin. This tellingly reveals that excellent pilots such as Yeates and his contemporaries in 46 squadron valued height, and the concurrent ability to strike unseen, running counter to the common image of swirling dogfights.  Trivia  The title, \\"Winged Victory\\", was not Yeates' choice - it was forced on him by his original publisher, who wanted the book to appear more patriotic and exciting. Yeates' original choice of title was the much more apt, bleaker \\"Wingless Victor\\". Yeates was credited with five enemy aircraft shot down in World War I (2 + 3 shared). Some of the characters of the book have real names of pilots who served in 46 Squadron at the time, like ace George Edwin Thomson (21 enemy aircraft shot down, called \\"Tommy\\" in the book, and who is transferred to Home Establishment before April 1918), Harry Noel Cornforth Robinson (called \\"Robinson\\" in the book, 10 aircraft destroyed), and Horace Gilbert Wanklyn Debenham (\\"Debenham\\" in the book, six enemy aircraft destroyed). There are some with names very similar to real names, like Flight Commander \\"MacAndrews (Mac)\\" who is based upon Canadian ace Donald MacLaren (48 enemy aircraft and six balloons shot down), who served in 46 Squadron at the time. Curiously, the Sphere Books 1969 edition of the book and the subsequent Mayflower Books 1972 edition have an illustration of SE5as dogfighting with Fokker D.VIIs on the cover when the only aircraft the main characters fly is the Sopwith Camel. (The 1974 Mayflower reprint shows Sopwith Camels). The 1962 reprint of the Jonathan Cape edition, however, has a fly leaf with two Sopwith Camels depicted. It was a large inspiration in the work of Derek Robinson, particularly the 1971 Booker Prize-nominated Goshawk Squadron.

According to the official record, Witold Urbanowicz was the second highest-scoring Polish fighter ace, with 17 confirmed wartime kills and 1 probable, not counting his pre-war victory. He was awarded with several decorations, among others the Virtuti Militari and British Distinguished Flying Cross. He also published several books of memoirs. Biography Urbanowicz was born in Olszanka, August√≥w County. In 1930 he entered the Szko≈Ça PodchorƒÖ≈ºych Lotnictwa cadet flying school in Dƒôblin, graduating in 1932 as a 2/Lt. Observer. He was then posted to the night bomber squadron of the 1st Air Regiment in Warsaw. Later he completed an advanced pilotage course to become a fighter pilot. In the 1930s he flew with the 113th and No. 111th \\"Ko≈õciuszko\\" Squadron. In August 1936, flying an PZL P.11a, he shot down a Soviet reconnaissance plane which had crossed into Polish airspace. He was officially reprimanded and unofficially congratulated by his superior officer and as \\"punishment\\" in October 1936 was transferred to an air force training school in Deblin where he was nicknamed \\"Cobra\\". =Second World War= During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Urbanowicz was in an improvised Ulez Group, composed of flying instructors, flying obsolete PZL P.7a fighters and covering the Dƒôblin and U≈Çƒô≈º airfields. Despite a few encounters with enemy airplanes the Polish fighters (which could barely match the speed of German bombers) were not able to shoot down any enemy planes. On 8 September the school was evacuated from Ulez and Dƒôblin.King 2010, p.339 He was ordered with the cadets to Romania, where they were told to await re-equipment: British and French aircraft were rumoured to have been sent, but no aircraft arrived. Urbanowicz returned to Poland to continue to fight, but after the Soviet invasion of Poland, he was captured by a Soviet irregular unit. The same day he managed to escape with two cadets and crossed the Romanian border and eventually found his way to France where, after the fall of Poland, a new Polish army was being formed. While in France he and a group of other Polish pilots were invited to join the Royal Air Force in Great Britain. After initial training with 1 School of Army Co-operation at Old Sarum, he was sent to 6 OTU for re-training on fighters in July 1940. In August he was assigned to No. 145 Squadron RAF, and became operational on 4 August 1940. On 8 August he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 Major Joachim Schlichting of V./LG 1 while flying with No. 601 Squadron (although he was never officially attached to the unit) and on 12 August a Junkers Ju 88 of KG 51. On 21 August he was transferred to the Polish-manned No. 303 Squadron, flying a Hawker Hurricane as \\"A\\" Flight commander. On 6 September he shot down a Bf 109 of JG 52. On 7 September he became Squadron Leader, after Zdzis≈Çaw Krasnodƒôbski was badly burned. On 15 September Urbanowicz claimed two Dornier Do. 17's of KG 2. On 18 September 1940 Urbanowicz was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari by the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Forces, General Sikorski. On 24 October, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.King 2010, p.338 On 27 September he was officially credited with shooting down four aircraft: two Ju 88s of KG 77, a Bf 109 and a Bf 110 of 15.LG 1. On 30 September he claimed three Bf 109s (one from stab.JG 26, one of II./JG 53 and one of 4.JG 54) and one Dornier Do 17 of KG 3. Despite his success Urbanowicz was never popular at Polish headquarters and on 21 October he was forced to hand over command of the Squadron to Zdzis≈Çaw Henneberg. During the Battle of Britain, he claimed 15 confirmed kills and 1 probable, which made him one of the top Polish aces (second only to Stanis≈Çaw Skalski) and in the top ten Allied aces of the battle. Between 15 April 1941 and 1 June 1941 he commanded the 1st Polish Fighter Wing based at RAF Northolt, before being posted to staff work at No. 11 Group RAF HQ. In June 1941 he was assigned as the 2nd Air Attach√© in the Polish Embassy in the United States. In September 1943 Urbanowicz joined the USAAF 14th Air Force on attachment in China. On 23 October he joined the 75th Fighter Squadron of the 23rd Fighter Group (Flying Tigers). Flying a P-40 Warhawk he took part in several combat missions. On 11 December he fought against six Japanese Mitsubishi Zeros and claimed two shot down (these were actually Nakajima Ki-44 \\"Tojo\\" fighters of the 85th Sentai ).Aircraft of the Aces 100, Ki-44 \\"Tojo\\" Aces by Nicholas Millman, Osprey Publishing, p.26 According to his reports he also shot other airplanes over China, and destroyed some on the ground but those victories were not officially confirmed.

History  The party was founded in 1998 by Moldovan politician Valery Klymenko. At the legislative election on 6 March 2005, the party won 3.8% of the popular vote, but no seats. The party intended to participate to the 2014 election, but later withdrew its list. In 2015, the party decided to nominate Ilan Shor for Mayor of the town of Orhei. Shor, who was at that point in time under house arrest, won a majority of the votes in the first round of the election and subsequently became the leading figure within the party. On 1 December 2018 the party joined the Alliance of Conservative and Reformists in Europe. In December 2018, the party created a model collective farm based on its own election program in the Orgeev region, dubbing it the \\"Commune of Dreams\\". At the legislative election of 2019, the party 8,32% of votes and elected seven MPs, entering parliament for the first time in its history. The party organized a Victory Day parade in Chi»ôinƒÉu on 9 May 2019. Ideology The party's ideology is based on social conservatism, Moldovan identity and support for establishing a welfare state. The party's 2019 program introduced points such as: * Free Universal health care; * Free education including higher education; * Increasing the size and scope of Disability benefits, maternity benefits and retirement pensions; * The creation of modernised collective farms to work alongside the private sector; * Active state intervention in the spheres of infrastructure, transport, energy, communications, housing, pharmaceuticals, etc.; * The Nationalization of foreign-owned energy companies; * A commitment to law and order including both reinstating the death penalty for particularly dangerous criminals and addressing the underlying socioeconomic issues that may cause crime; * A commitment to Moldovan Independence and Military neutrality. The opening paragraphs of the party's 2008 election program state that it viewed the average person's quality of life as superior under the Soviet Union when compared to modern times. It further stated that it viewed Moldova's socio- economic problems as relating to Moldova's negative relationship with the Russian Federation.

The sea tractor was most popular during the early 1930s, as a unique way to give scenic tours to patrons of waterfront hotels and resorts. In other applications, sea tractors were used simply as a ferry through shallow waters. The use of sea tractors has declined since, as boats, ferries, and other aquatic vessels often serve the same function much more efficiently and comfortably. Examples The South Sands sea tractor docked with a ferry for the transfer of passengers, August 2011 The Talus MB-H amphibious tractor, used for launching rescue lifeboats The boat launching vehicle used by Ballybunion Sea and Cliff Rescue, 2008 The hotel at Burgh Island operates a sea tractor, to carry hotel guests and other visitors the to the island at high tide, when the causeway connecting the island to the Devon mainland is submerged. The current tractor is the third one to be used at this location. A sea tractor is also used at South Sands Beach near Salcombe, Devon. The beach has no jetty or pier and the South Sands Ferry therefore cannot reach dry land to pick up passengers. The sea tractor transports passengers to the ferry waiting a few metres out to sea. The United States Army Corps of Engineers operates a three-wheeled sea tractor called the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy (CRAB). This vehicle consists of a wheeled tripod supporting an operating platform above ground level. It can move at on land and at a somewhat slower speed in water. It was built for scientific research on Beach nourishment. The British and Irish maritime rescue organisation the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operates a number of different amphibious tractors for launching and recovering inshore lifeboats from beaches. These are wheeled or tracked vehicles capable of operating largely submerged, and some have cable winches.

History In the autumn of 1989, the materials of the 18th Stockholm Congress of Socialist International reached Chi≈üinƒÉu from Estonia and did stir up a lot of debates among those dissatisfied with the political realities in Moldovan SSR. The party was founded on May 13, 1990, when was known as the Social Democratic Party of Moldova (). The Founding Conference elected Oazu Nantoi, Ion NegurƒÉ, Alexandru Co»ôelev as the Party Co-Chairpersons.Social-Democratic Party of Moldova Initially, the Social-Democratic Party of Moldova fought for the independence of the Moldovan SSR. That was the first party to promote the values of European social democracy in Moldova.What‚Äôs happening with Social Democratic Party of Moldova? At the third congress of the party, 25‚Äì26 February 1995, Anatol »öƒÉranu was elected as a new head of the party.Partidul Social Democrat (PSD) On the eve of 1996 presidential elections, Social Democrats were the only ones to openly support Petru Lucinschi. During 1996-1998, the party underwent some internal problems generated from within by controversial opinions on the party political course as well as from outside. This internal crisis culminated in 1998, when Gheorghe Sima group left the party. The old team headed by Oazu Nantoi took over the party leadership. Oazu Nantoi was a member of the Government of Moldova, but he resigned from Government in March 2000 and the 7th Congress of the party, 27‚Äì28 May 2000, was just the first step towards launching its own candidate as the president of Moldova. Social- Democratic Party of Moldova was a member of the Socialist International. Incumbent Party Chairperson, Oazu Nantoi, attended in November 1999 the 21st Paris Congress of the Socialist International.XXI Congress of the Socialist International, Paris, 8-10 November 1999, LIST OF PARTICIPANTS At the seventh congress of the party, 1 February 2004, Oazu Nantoi came with a proposition for Ion Mu»ôuc (famous businessman in telecommunications) to take over the party leadership and refused he himself to be designated. In 1999 Social Democrats insisted on Ion Mu≈üuc candidacy for the position of Mayor of Chi»ôinƒÉu. At the legislative elections on March 6th, 2005, the party won 2.9% of the popular vote, but no seats. In December 2007 the party merged with the Social Democracy Party (Partidul Democra≈£iei Sociale, PDS) of former prime minister Dumitru Braghi»ô. Some representatives of the Centrist Union of Moldova joined the new party, too. They didn't agree with the decision of their leader, Mihai Petrache, to abandon the process of negotiation regarding the unification of social democrats that had started some months before.Info- Prim Neo, 23.10.2007: PDS, PSDM to merge by yearend Braghis has become new leader of the merged party. Eduard Mu»ôuc, who was the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova before the fusion congress, has become the new secretary general of the party.DECA Press, 24.12.2007: Dumitru Braghis will lead the unified social-democrats In June 2008 Eduard Mu≈üuc formed a coalition with the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova and Christian Democratic People's Party to become president of the City Council of Chi≈üinƒÉu. The year before the party's president Braghis was heavily criticized by the same communists when he ran for mayor. Some party members saw this as betrayal and left the party for Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (PLDM). In February 2010, it was reported that approximately 11,000 members of the PSD defected to the rival centre-left Democratic Party of Moldova.Large portion of small left- wing party migrates to Democrats Following the 12th party congress, on April 17, 2010, Victor »òelin has been elected as the new party president.

Party switching also occurs quite commonly in Brazil, Italy, Ukraine, India, Malaysia and the Philippines. Australia It is rare in Australia for a member of a major party to switch to another political party. It is more common for a member of parliament to become an independent or form their own minor political party. Notable individual party switchers at federal level include: *Agnes Robertson ‚Äì Liberal to Country, 1955 *Don Chipp ‚Äì Liberal to Democrats (new party), 1977 *Peter Richardson ‚Äì Liberal to Progress, 1977 *John Siddons and David Vigor ‚Äì Democrats to Unite Australia (new party), 1987 *Cheryl Kernot ‚Äì Democrats to Labor, 1997 *John Bradford ‚Äì Liberal to Christian Democrats, 1998 *Julian McGauran ‚Äì Liberal to National, 2006 Mass defections took place on several occasions in the 20th century due to Australian Labor Party (ALP) splits ‚Äì in 1916 (to the National Labor Party, including the sitting prime minister Billy Hughes), in 1931 (to Lang Labor), in 1940 (to the Non-Communist Labor Party), and in 1955 (to the Anti-Communist Labor Party). Italy In Italy, party- switching is more common than in other Western European parliamentary democracies, with nearly 25% of members of the Italian Chamber of Deputies switching parties at least once during the 1996 to 2001 legislative term. A 2004 article in the Journal of Politics posited that party-switching in Italy \\"most likely is motivated by party labels that provide little information about policy goals and that pit copartisans against each other in the effort to serve constituent needs.\\" New Zealand Party switching in New Zealand gained currency during the end of the 1980s, and even more so in the late 1990s after mixed member proportional representation was implemented. In particular, the phrase \\"waka-jumping\\" entered the public consciousness in 1998 when then-Prime Minister Jenny Shipley expelled the New Zealand First party from the ruling coalition government, and several New Zealand First MPs resigned from the party and stayed loyal to the government. In response to these defections, the Electoral Integrity Act was passed in 2001, which later expired in 2005. A proposal to replace the Act failed in 2005 but was successful in 2018. A private members' bill to repeal the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2018 was considered in 2020 and is currently before the Select Committee. Nicaragua In Nicaragua some major party switches occurred between 2002 and 2006 when the two major political parties, the Constitutional Liberal Party and the Sandinista National Liberation Front, formed a pact and members of both parties left to form new parties or make alliances with smaller ones.  Philippines  Party-switching \\"has become the norm, the practice\\" in the Philippines, according to Julio Teehankee, a political science professor in De La Salle University. During midterm elections, politicians usually attach themselves to the party of the ruling president. This has led to transactional dealings, and parties are identified more on personalities instead of platforms. Aside from party-switching, internal squabbles within parties lead to formation of new ones. Vice President Jejomar Binay, elected under PDP‚ÄìLaban, formed his own United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) as his party for his 2016 presidential campaign. Ex-Lakas members who do not want to join the then ruling Liberal Party in 2013 joined together to form the National Unity Party. An example would be boxer Manny Pacquiao's first foray into politics saw him losing in 2007 congressional race in South Cotabato under the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino. He then won as congressman in the neighboring province of Sarangani under the Nacionalista Party in 2010, but switched over to the then ruling Liberal Party. Pacquiao then joined Binay's PDP‚ÄìLaban and followed him to UNA when he won as senator in 2016. Pacquiao then rejoined the now ruling PDP‚ÄìLaban after the elections.  Russia  In the Russian Federation, party switching is considered illegal in the State Duma and is highly frowned upon. After major party switches during the Boris Yeltsin Presidency, party switching was declared illegal in the State Duma, and can result in a forced resignation of the State Duma representative by the chairman of their ex-political party. However, there is an exception. If a member of the State Duma is considered an Independent politician, he or she may be permitted to join and switch to a party at any time. They may not switch after that. After a forced resignation, the State Duma representative can run again in future elections, as their new party's whip. The chairman of the political party can choose to replace the party switcher with whomever they choose. Party merging, however, is not illegal and can be seen when a big amount of political parties merged into United Russia, the current ruling party of Russia.  Turkey  Party switching is not unusual in Turkey, but Kubilay Uygun is known for his repeated switching during his single term in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (1995 - 1999). He resigned from his party seven times and served four different parties, finishing as an independent.  Ukraine  In Ukraine, the imperative mandate provision of the Ukrainian Constitution banned party switching in Parliament from 2004 to 2010. The mandate stipulated that the constitution and laws of Ukraine obliged members of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, to remain members of the parliamentary faction or bloc in which they were elected.Rada Approves Cancellation Of Rule That Bans Deputies From Switching Factions , The Financial (October 8, 2010) This was evident during the 2007 Ukrainian political crisis where members of the opposition crossed party lines with plans to undermine Presidential authority and move towards the 300 constitutional majority. United States Party- switching in the United States Congress (for example, from the Republican Party and Democratic parties, or vice versa) is relatively rare. Over the period 1947 to 1997, there were only 20 members of the House of Representatives and Senate who switched parties. Periods of a high degree of party-switching (among both elected officials and citizens) are linked to periods of partisan realignment.David Castle & Patrick J. Fett, \\"Member Goals and Party Switching in the U.S. Congress\\" in Congress on Display, Congress at Work (ed. William T. Bianco: University of Michigan Press, 2000), p. 231.Antoine Yoshinaka, Crossing the Aisle: Party Switching by US Legislators in the Postwar Era (Cambridge University Press, 2016), p. 12. After the 1994 elections (in which Republicans gained control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in four decades), five House Democrats and two Senate Democrats switched to the Republicans. Another notable switch took place in 2001 when Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont defected from the Republican Party to become a political independent, which placed the Senate in Democratic control.

Prior to assuming that post in January 2008, he had served as Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) from 1998 to early 2007. In January 2017, he became a regular CNN contributor. A native of Chicago, Illinois, he joined the Chicago Police Department as an 18-year-old cadet in 1968. After serving six years as a patrol officer, he was promoted to sergeant in 1977. He was appointed a lieutenant in 1984 and became captain in 1988. He served as Commander of the Narcotics Section from 1989 to 1992 before spending two years as a Deputy Chief of the police force's Patrol Division. In 1994, he was appointed Deputy Superintendent. In 1998, he became the MPDC chief. During his tenure, he was involved in several high-profile cases as chief of police in Washington, D.C., such as the Chandra Levy murder investigation. He has also been in the spotlight since the September 11 attacks focused attention on security issues around Washington, D.C. Ramsey is a graduate of the FBI National Academy and holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois. He has served as an adjunct professor at Lewis University and Northwestern University. Ramsey is a former member of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. Career as Washington, D.C. police chief Ramsey's eight-year tenure as Chief of Police saw crime rates decline about 40%, the expansion of community policing and traffic safety programs, and improved MPDC recruiting and hiring standards, training, equipment, facilities and fleet. He reorganized the department to cut bureaucracy, and created Regional Operations Commands to oversee the quality of D.C. police services. He helped to create a non-emergency 3-1-1 system and made crime information readily available to the public through CrimeReports.com. He and his department assisted the Department of Homeland Security during the state funerals of Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. =Traffic checkpoints= Under Ramsey, the D.C, police instituted traffic checkpoints at which information about motorists who were breaking no law at the time was entered into a database. The move was called an \\"invasion of privacy\\" by an official of the police union. =Pershing Park arrests= On September 27, 2002, the MPD made a mass arrest of a large group of demonstrators who had assembled in DC's Pershing Park to protest the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings. The police enclosed over 400 people in the park and arrested them without ordering them to disperse or allowing them to leave the park. Many of the arrested were not actually demonstrators, but were journalists, legal observers, and pedestrians. On January 13, 2006, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the arrests violated the Fourth Amendment and that Chief Ramsey could be held personally liable for the violations. On August 2, 2007, City officials in Washington agreed to pay $1 million to more than 120 of the protesters, on top of other settlements by the D.C. government, including one for $640,000. Ramsey was represented by Mark Tuohey who generated at least $1.53 million in fees for his law firm Vinson & Elkins. According to testimony given by Detective Paul Hustler, Ramsey himself gave the arrest order, although he has repeatedly denied this. Hustler claims he overheard Ramsey say \\"We're going to lock them up and teach them a lesson.\\"  Retiremant from MPDC  On November 20, 2006, Ramsey announced that he would step down as police chief on January 2, 2007, the inauguration day of Washington, D.C Mayor-Elect Adrian M. Fenty. Fenty selected Cathy Lanier, a 39-year-old commander of the MPDC's Homeland Security Division, as his replacement. Even though Ramsey's official last day was December 28, 2006, he stayed on until January 2, 2007, to deal with security during the state funeral of former president Gerald Ford. Philadelphia Police Commissioner On November 15, 2007, Philadelphia Mayor Elect Michael Nutter nominated Ramsey as Police Commissioner. Ramsey came out of retirement to accept the position, and he was sworn in at the beginning of Nutter's term as Mayor on January 7, 2008. Since Commissioner Ramsey assumed his position, the city's homicide rate has dropped 37 percent and violent crime 31 percent. In the city's nine most dangerous districts, which account for 65% of homicides and 75% of shootings, homicides are down by over 40 percent. Ramsey's tactics have included installing a network of surveillance cameras in the city's most dangerous sections, increasing the number of cops on the beat, and moving police patrols out of their squad cars and onto foot patrols or bicycle patrols. In 2014 President Obama selected Commissioner Ramsey to serve as Co-Chair of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Commissioner Ramsey has also served as President of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) and the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA). On October 14, 2015, Ramsey announced his retirement from the Philadelphia Police Department, effective on January 5, 2016. References External links * Charles H.

He was also made dean of the theology faculty at the new University of Wittenberg when it was founded in 1502. In 1512, while in his fifties, Staupitz resigned his professorship and relocated to the southern part of Germany, resigning his vicar-generalship officially in 1520. In 1522 he accepted an offer from the Benedictines inviting him to join their order, becoming Abbot of St Peter's in Salzburg. As Augustinian Superior, Staupitz first met Martin Luther at Erfurt in April 1506. A young friar plagued by persistent thoughts of spiritual inadequacy, Luther felt compelled to confess to Staupitz everything sinful he had ever done. At least once, Luther spent six hours confessing to Staupitz, who responded to the young man's doubts by counselling him on the Means of Grace and on salvation through the blood of Christ. He also commanded Luther to pursue a more academic career, hoping it would provide a distraction from his recurrent theological brooding. In 1518 after Luther was declared a heretic, Staupitz was appointed promagister of the Augustinian order to plead in protest with Luther, discussing the issue of indulgences in great detail. Staupitz is sometimes categorized as a forerunner of Luther, although his actual words indicate a man driven by anxious suspicions and an encouraging desire to understand Luther's objections. Staupitz perceived Luther's complaints as questions against clerical abuses, rather than as fundamental disputes of dogma. Ultimately, Staupitz released Martin Luther from the Augustinian order, preserving the good name of the order while simultaneously giving Luther freedom to act. His connection with Luther's views was now sealed, and in 1520 Pope Leo X demanded an abjuration and revocation of heresy from Staupitz. He refused to revoke, on the grounds that he had never asserted Luther's heresies himself, but he did abjure and recognize the Pontiff as his judge. Staupitz was no Lutheran, but was thoroughly Catholic in matters of faith, especially as regards the freedom of the will, the meritoriousness of good works, and justification, which has been established by Paulus from the writings of Staupitz. However, Luther perceived his abjuration as a betrayal. In his last letter to Luther in 1524 Staupitz made it clear he was bitter about the direction of the Reformation and its seemingly willful destruction of the unity of the Christian Church. Staupitz also wrote theological works on the topics of predestination, faith, and love. In 1559, Pope Paul IV added these texts to the Index of Prohibited Books, seeing them as perhaps compromised by the friendly relations between Staupitz and Luther during Luther's earlier years. Staupitz died in 1524 at St Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg, where he had become a monk in 1522, rising quickly to the post of abbot. He is now celebrated in the Lutheran liturgical calendar.

She was a noted gardener and a writer and editor of the works of others. Early life Born as Edith Helen Chaplin in Blankney, Lincolnshire, she was the daughter of Henry Chaplin, landowner and Conservative politician and later the 1st Viscount Chaplin (1840-1923), and Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower (1855-1881). After the death of her mother in 1881, Edith was raised largely at Dunrobin Castle, Sutherland, the estate of her maternal grandfather, the third Duke of Sutherland. Public works Lady Londonderry pictured in the uniform of the Women's Legion In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, she was appointed the Colonel-in-Chief of the Women's Volunteer Reserve (WVR), a volunteer force formed of women replacing the men who had left work and gone up to the Front. The WVR was established in December 1914 in response to German bombing raids on East Coast towns during the First World War Lady Londonderry also aided with the organisation of the Officers' Hospital set up in her house, and was the first woman to be appointed to be a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Military Division, upon the Order's establishment in 1917. Lady Londonderry's friendship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, although platonic, was a source of gossip in her time and has since become an iconic friendship of English social history. In 1935 she helped to establish the Women's Gas Council, as its first president, assisted by organising secretary Katherine Halpin. Circe and the Sirens: Group Portrait of the Hon.

It adjoins Woburn Sands in the Borough of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. The Office for National Statistics records both as part of the Milton Keynes urban area.See map at It is centred east southeast of Central Milton Keynes and south of the M1 junction 13. It has its own railway station, three stops from Bletchley, and an historic centre with 29 listed buildings. History =Etymology= Asperele and Aspel are recorded in Letter Patents, Assize Rolls and such documents of the 13th century, with the names Aspelegise appearing in the following century. The name derives from \\"Aspenlea\\" meaning the aspen clearing ‚Äì and from the late medieval period, \\"of the de Guise family\\" when Anselm de Gyse became Lord of the Manor in 1375. Early history The first record of Aspley dates from 969, when land there comprising 15 hides was granted by King Edgar (the Peaceable) to his thegn (thane) Alfwold. By the date of the Domesday Book, 1086, the parish had 25 households, five of which were recorded as serfs. The book notes it covered a large tract of agricultural land, valued at ¬£10 to its overlords, though rendering only ¬£8, and was held before the conquest by Leofeva of Earl Waltheof. Its contemporary manor owner was Acard of Ivry who held of Hugh de Beauchamp, its feudal overlord. In total were 12 ploughlands (larger than average), 10 ploughs of meadow, woodland producing 50 hogs per year, one mill; the book records no church at that date. Its church is mentioned in the records of the diocese in 1223.Church of England (a church near you) =Aspley Manor= Most of the cultivated land was held by the manor in the medieval period. This stayed in Acard's family until his descendant, Reginald de Ivri granted a lease to Falkes de Breaut√©. On confiscation of Falkes's estates in 1225 King Henry III granted the rest of the lease to Henry de Capella, however by 1227 a certain \\"Reginald de St. Valery\\" was free to release the land (entire fee) to his regent, now Henry was a 20-year-old adult, Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent, with an official approval (confirmation of alienation). Similarly however, in 1233 the King confiscated his lands, however Hubert was restored to all his wealth the following year in the Testa de Nevill. By 1267 it is established in the royal returns and copies (literally, rolls) of letters that he had subinfeudated the manor to Anselm de Gyse, in return for knight's service to John de Burgh and heirs. After the middle of the 14th century the heirs of Hubert de Burgh in Aspley seem to have lapsed, and the manor was held directly of the barony of Bedford. The tenancy was in this period that of de Guise. Anselm died in 1295 left as heir a son John, then aged 17 ‚Äì his descendants inherited this tenancy and became direct tenants as mentioned. In 1428 the lord of the manor's lord briefly changed to Giles Bridges, who had married Catherine Gyse, widow, of the previous lord, Reginald Gyse, however this was brief. Nonetheless, Catherine had from her first marriage, male issue and the House of Gyse remained with the manor's possession. As such, Sir John Gyse created a knight by Prince Arthur (Tudor), died holding Aspley Guise Manor in 1501. In 1541, the manor of Aspley Guise was annexed to the newly formed honour of Ampthill, which in 1551 was granted for life to Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I). An extent of the manor in 1560 mentions two windmills, but none survive in the historic ecclesiastical parish. In 1560 she gave this asset by royal grant to Sir Richard Lee, military engineer: summarised as being worth a fairly average ¬£14 13s. d., &c.; (i.e. additionally, impecunious benefits accrued) per year. His daughter Ann, later Mrs Ralph Norwich, received permission to alienate (sell) the manor to Francis Bury, whose heir, Frances, by arrangement or fate married Ann's grandson, Thomas Lee Sadleir. The estate passed down in a straightforward line of Sadleirs to Richard Vernon Sadleir who died in 1810, whose sister Ursula Moody inherited it. The owner in 1912 was accordingly her descendant, a certain Mr F. Moody. The current manor house was built about 1700. =Rectory= As to the church lands and tithes, in 1317 a further confirmation of Simon de Beauchamp's grant of the church and two parts of the tithes was made in favour of Newnham Priory. In 1544, these lands and the advowson were released by John Gyse and Anselm his son and heir to the Crown. In the similarly timed Dissolution of the Chantries (one year before its famed successor) an acre here was appropriated by the crown and its proceeds given to fund a new church window. What remained of the rectory was consolidated the vicarage of Husborne Crawley in 1796 and re-established half a century later. =The Church Charities= The Town Close, administered by the ecclesiastical parish, containing awarded under the Inclosure Act 1761, by 1912 still produced for the poor agricultural produce worth ¬£8 18s. a year, which was expended from time to time on its produce growers' work. 20th century In the early 20th century large brickworks, with clay extraction was the main industry in the parish itself, having ceased by that century the extraction of fuller's earth, on which profit was no longer possible. Agriculture, as today formed a minority of employment. The Rookery, a secluded Victorian mansion in Church Street, was used by intelligence operatives during the Second World War for black propaganda against Germany controlled by Sefton Delmer.The Rookery, Aspley Guise ‚Äì Bedfordshire Record Office, accessed 26 July 2010 Landmarks Aspley has three historic houses of higher architectural classification. Its church, equally, is Grade II* listed. The garden walls and gateway of Aspley House are listed in an entry separate from it,Aspley House's Gateway and Garden Wall giving 30 structures in all identified by English Heritage as worthy of listing. =St Botolph's church= The medieval Anglican church is dedicated to St Botolph and was reworked extensively in the early and late 19th century. Its tower has six bells. Its southern window of a nativity screen was installed during the last major series of renovations and is described by the church as \\"very fine\\". The north aisle has a 15th-century traceried screen, a similarly dated circular font and a tomb chest with effigy of knight, probably Sir William Tyrington, estimated to date to c.1400. In this floor are typical brasses, one to John Danvers or Daweners,http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H4/CP40no605/bCP40ono605dorses/IMG_1170.htm {last entry on page}, as defendant rector, c.1410, another c.1500, probably to Sir John de Gyse/Guise.St Botolph's =Aspley House= This was built in 1695 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren and altered c. 1750 and again later.Aspley House In 1912 this house still contained many fine portraits of the Hervey and Chernock families. =Guise House= In the 18th century, Guise House and its grounds were home to (Aspley) Classical Academy until 1845, a school at its peak rated to rival Eton and Harrow. It has above its fa√ßade a Greek-style open pediment with windows in its tympanum (triangular area). It has a stone parapet tower.Guise House =The Old House= The Old House is timber-frame (of typical Tudor architectural construction) and dates from 1575 with some Georgian alterations. The Old House =Others= The village has 26 other examples of listed architecture, many of them early Georgian. The village is served by Aspley Guise railway station, a small station on the Marston Vale Line running between Bedford and Bletchley. Topography The southwestern area, which includes Aspley Wood has substantial pine trees, the west has a public golf course, accessed from either road to Woburn Sands. In the northern part crops are grown. Aspley Heath, once part of the parish, is now its own village and civil parish and is south of Aspley Wood, relatively distant to the south-west. Elevations range from 75m AOD at the northern boundary marked by the middle of the M1 (with side-by-side, parallel, local road the A422), to the start of village centre which is at between 84m (at the station) and 124m at the Common Farm and Golf course in the southwest, just below which to two sides is most of the village. Streets are steepest between the station developed area and the historic upland area. A spring rises on this slope, east of Church Street, the single road scaling the slope. Localities The parish is today relatively small compared to others and has kept to a main north-south development, with buffer zones and recreational areas to either side ‚Äì see linear development. =Aspley Guise Triangle= The 'Aspley Guise triangle' is its northern area of farmland bounded by the A421 to the north and north-east and the Marston Vale line to the south (which separates it from the developed and recreational areas of Aspley Guise) and Cranfield Road to the west. It had been named with this term in the regional body's Expansion plans for Milton Keynes and identified as an appropriate possibility, being served by a railway station. In the ministerial ruling on the plan, this area was excluded on the technicality that it is not part of the South East of England Region, though with a hint that it might appear again in an East of England regional spatial strategy, which had its own fulfilled plans.Consultation Home > Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) > Proposed Changes for Consultation > Secretary of State's Proposed Changes 23 > Milton Keynes and Aylesbury Vale Commentary on chapter 23(5). Following the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the coalition government cancelled its predecessor's regional housing targets and bodies. The Local Authority (Central Bedfordshire Council) has since put forward a Local Plan that identifies this area of land for development of 3,000 homes plus facilities. Transport =Road= Aspley Guise is centred about south-east of Milton Keynes and south-west of the M1 motorway's junction 13. It has access to both via uncategorised local roads. =Rail= Aspley Guise railway station is on the Marston Vale line between and and has trains hourly Monday-Saturday.

It is found in subtropical or tropical climates. The females can grow up to 24 mm and the smaller males are 12 to 15 mm long. It is winged and a strong flier, pale green to yellowish green in color, with a yellow line running up the sides. The nymphs are brown or black in color and are burrowers. It is usually an outdoor species and is rarely found indoors, so is not considered a pest. The adults can often be found in shrubbery, trees, and plants. The young can be found under logs and other debris. It is often attracted to both indoor and outdoor lights and it is mainly a nocturnal species. It is often a popular pet roach due to its relatively pleasant green color, and because it is not an invasive indoor species. It is also used as food for other pets. The ootheca (egg case) is long, is curved, and has indentations that show where the eggs are located. A study found that they contained 28 to 60 eggs (average 46). The ootheca is carried internally by the female until the eggs hatch. At the eggs hatch in about 48 days, after which male nymphs mature in about 144 days, and female nymphs mature in about 181 days.

He won the gold medal in the 100-metre breaststroke at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Since then Moorhouse, a former pupil of Bradford Grammar School, has translated his sporting success to a successful career in the business world, as managing director of Lane4, a consultancy helping individuals and teams around the world reach their fullest potential. He was voted Best Leader at the Sunday Times Best Small Companies to Work for in 2009 and 2007 and has been listed in HR Magazine's Most Influential UK Thinkers since 2010. He is also a swimming commentator for BBC television. Swimming career Moorhouse was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, attended Bradford Grammar School and went to 4th Shipley Scouts. Moorhouse's inspiration to become seriously involved in national and international competitive swimming came at the age of 12 when he watched David Wilkie win gold at the Montreal Olympics. In 1980 he was selected for the England Junior team and broke the national junior records for both the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke. When he was 15, he was chosen for the national senior squad, number two to the gold medallist at the Moscow Olympics, Duncan Goodhew. Moorhouse became Britain's number one breaststroke swimmer in 1981 when he won a bronze medal for the 200 m in the European Championships in Yugoslavia. The following year he gained his first taste of gold after winning the 100 m breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, in a new British Record of 1:02.93, along with a bronze in the 200m breaststroke. In the World Championships in Guayaquil shortly afterwards, he missed bronze by just 2/100th of a second in the 100m breaststroke behind (future) 1984 Olympic Champions Steve Lundquist (USA) and Victor Davis (CAN), and future world record holder John Moffet (USA). The following year he was back to winning ways taking gold in the 200m breaststroke at the 1983 European Championships in Rome together with a silver in the 100m. At the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, Moorhouse was tipped for a gold medal in the 100 m breaststroke but missed out completely, coming fourth behind Steve Lundquist of the USA who won gold in a new world record of 1:01.65 swimming in the adjacent lane. \\"I was devastated\\", he says. \\"After the Games I convinced myself that I had no talent and that I was never going to win again. I didn't want anything to do with swimming.‚Äù On New Year's Eve 1984, Moorhouse stayed home alone to reflect and decided to train for a competition in April 1985 as a 'last roll of the dice' to see whether he had what it took to conquer the world. His decision was vindicated when he broke the World Short Course (25 m pool) record for the 100 m in a time of 1:00.58, and went on to win the European Championships gold medal in Bulgaria in a time of 1:02.99. The year 1986 was a bittersweet one for Moorhouse. At the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, he narrowly took silver in the 100m breaststroke behind long-time rival Victor Davis of Canada. However, he put his disappointment behind him to turn the tables on Davis in the 200m breaststroke a few days later, an event in which the Canadian had been heavily favoured as the reigning Olympic Champion and world record holder. Overtaking Davis in the second half of the race, Moorhouse took gold in a personal best and new English record of 2:16.35. A month later in Madrid, Moorhouse qualified fastest for the 100m breaststroke final at the World Championships in a new European record of 1:02.28. In the final, he powered to the front in the second 50m to beat Victor Davis convincingly and win the race in another European record of 1:02.01. However, he was then controversially disqualified for an alleged dolphin kick at the turn, promoting Davis to gold. (FINA, swimming's world governing body, changed the breaststroke rules in 2005 to permit a single dolphin kick at the start and turn in recognition of the fact that this is often an unintended and involuntary reaction to the underwater pullout.) Despite his natural disappointment, though, Moorhouse finished the year ranked first in the world for the 100m breaststroke for the first time, a position he retained for the next four years. In 1987, putting the Madrid episode behind him, Moorhouse set a world short-course record, in a competition in Bonn, by becoming the first person to swim 100 m breaststroke in less than a minute, out-swimming the former world record holder, Rolf Beab in a time of 59.75 s. Later that year, at the European Championships in Strasbourg, Moorhouse retained his 100m title in a new European record of 1:02.13, before taking bronze in the 200m breaststroke in a personal best of 2:15.78 for good measure. Moorhouse started Olympic year, 1988, on the right note by winning the 100 m breaststroke at the US Indoor Championships to confirm his status as number one in the world. In September he achieved a lifetime's ambition at Seoul when, following in the footsteps of David Wilkie and Duncan Goodhew, he won Olympic gold in the 100 m breaststroke in a time of 1:02.04, overtaking Dmitry Volkov (URS) and K√°roly G√ºttler (HUN) at the wall, in a characteristic finishing surge, to win by 1/100th of a second in the closest race of those Olympics. Having finally achieved his Olympic dream, Moorhouse entered 1989 with an aura of invincibility. In the heats of the 100m breaststroke at the European Championships in Bonn, he achieved another lifetime's ambition when he set a new world record of 1:01.49. Notably, he broke the record set by Steve Lundquist in the 1984 Olympics, in the lane adjacent to Moorhouse, adding extra significance to his achievement. In the final, he secured his hat-trick of European golds in this event, winning in 1:01.71. In 1990, he equaled his own 100m breaststroke world record of 1:01.49 twice: first, to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland; and second, in the summer's British Championships at a time when the World Championships had initially been scheduled. However, due to the host city Perth (AUS) being in the Southern Hemisphere, the World Championships were postponed until January 1991 to coincide with summer. Here, Moorhouse swam another fantastic time of 1:01.58 but had to settle for silver behind a new world record and breakthrough performance from Hungary's Norbert R√≥zsa. (It is worth noting that the FINA World Championships were moved from a four-year cycle to a two- year cycle a decade later. Had that been the case in the late 1980s, then Moorhouse may well have won two world titles given that he was ranked first in the world for the five-year period from 1986 to 1990.) Later in 1991, he again took silver behind Norbert R√≥zsa in the European Championships in Athens in a time of 1:01.89, his final major medal and his fifth consecutive podium placing in this event. The following year, he qualified for the final of the 100m breaststroke at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but faded in the final to finish 8th to draw the curtain on his illustrious career. In the late 1980s, Adrian Moorhouse was one of Britain's most successful sportspeople, finishing as runner-up in the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year contest in 1988 following his Olympic win. His achievements continued the tradition of successful British men's breaststroke swimming that had started with Olympic golds from David Wilkie in 1976 and Duncan Goodhew in 1980. Moorhouse himself then inspired a new generation of British male breaststroke swimmers, starting with his domestic rival, double Olympic medalist Nick Gillingham, through to 2003 World Champion James Gibson, and more recently 2012 Olympic silver medalist Michael Jamieson, and, most notably, reigning Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth Champion and world record holder in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, Adam Peaty, on whose 2016 Olympic victory Moorhouse commentated for BBC television alongside his former Olympic teammate and butterfly medalist Andy Jameson. Throughout his career he regularly participated in the ASA National Championships and won 16 titles. The 50 metres breaststroke title in 1991 and 1992, the 100 metres breaststroke title in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991 and the 200 metres breaststroke title in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986. Rivalry with Victor Davis Canadian Victor Davis first encountered Moorhouse at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane when Davis took gold in the 200 m breaststroke, and Moorhouse took the gold in the 100 m breaststroke. They met again later at the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, but this time Davis had the upper hand in both events, taking the gold in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. Moorhouse, also in his first World Championships, finished 5th in the 100 m, and 7th in the 200 m. Their next encounter was at the 1984 Olympics and it seemed that both their chances were enhanced by the boycott of East Germany and the Soviet Union. The 1984 Games were perhaps Victor Davis' finest competition, as he took gold in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. Meanwhile, Moorhouse suffered badly. Having had severe tonsillitis just days before the start of the Games, he finished 4th in the 100 m and 6th in the 200 m. Davis, now at the pinnacle of his swimming career, was voted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame. At the time of the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Victor Davis took gold in the 100 m event. Now the European Champion, Moorhouse, surprised Davis by sneaking the gold in the 200 m event. By the time of the 1986 World Championships in Madrid, the world swimming media were hyping up the 100 m breaststroke event as 'the event of the championships', knowing that it would inevitably prove to be another great battle between Davis and Moorhouse. Davis couldn't contain Moorhouse over the final 25 m, and Moorhouse took the 100 m gold in a new European Record of 1.02.01 secs. Davis took the silver in 1:02.71. The officials disqualified Moorhouse for an 'illegal turn', claiming he had used a butterfly kicking action during the underwater phase of the 50 m turn. TV crews from around the world began to analyse the footage of the 'illegal turn' from all conceivable angles, but each time it looked perfectly sound. The call of the 'turn judge' was upheld on appeal and Davis was awarded the gold medal. Davis went on to take silver in the 200 m breaststroke ‚Äì beaten by Hungarian J√≥zsef Szab√≥. Moorhouse withdrew from the 200 m event with a strained adductor muscle. The final encounter between Davis and Moorhouse at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, which proved to be Davis' final international competition. Both had announced before the Games that the 100 m event would be their main priority. Davis had performed poorly at the Canadian Olympic Trials, and had not been selected for the 200 m breaststroke, while Moorhouse was ranked number one in the world, and his lifetime best of 1:01.78 was close to the world record 1:01.65. Davis, still the Canadian record holder at 1:01.99, was only ranked 6th in the world going into the 1988 Olympics and no-one really knew what kind of shape he was going to be in. In the morning heats, Davis looked very impressive. He led the field from the start, and easily won his heat in a time of 1:02.48. Moorhouse was able to qualify in a faster time, winning his heat in 1:02.19. After one false start, Moorhouse looked the more nervous of the two behind the starting blocks. Meanwhile, Davis looked calm. At the second start, both Davis and Dmitri Volkov of the USSR began strongly, leaving Moorhouse slightly trailing. Volkov opened a 2-metre lead over the first 50 m, and Davis was matched stroke for stroke by Moorhouse. Volkov touched first at the 50 m mark in 28.12 s, setting a new 50 metre breaststroke world record. Moorhouse turned 6th in 29.42 s, and Davis turned 7th in 29.46 s. Volkov extended his lead, and as he reached the 75 m mark, he looked a certainty for the gold medal. He was 3‚Äì4 metres ahead of Moorhouse, Davis and K√°roly G√ºttler of Hungary. At this point Davis and Moorhouse closed in on Volkov. Moorhouse took the gold in 1:02.04, just ahead of Guttler's time of 1:02.05. The bronze medal was won by Volkov, in a time of 1:02.20, leaving Davis in 4th place, with a time of 1:02.38. Later career and retirement In 1989 Moorhouse was appointed MBE. He remained as the world number one until 1991 but at the Barcelona Olympic Games he finished eighth in the final and soon retired from swimming. He has since enjoyed a successful career as a Management Consultant, co-founding Lane4 in 1995, where he works with a wide range of organisations to help individuals and teams around the world reach their potential. Moorhouse was chosen as an official Team GB Ambassador for London 2012 Games and was also a torchbearer.

LexA forms de facto a two-component regulatory system with RecA, which senses DNA damage at stalled replication forks, forming monofilaments and acquiring an active conformation capable of binding to LexA and causing LexA to cleave itself, in a process called autoproteolysis. DNA damage can be inflicted by the action of antibiotics, bacteriophages, and UV light. Of potential clinical interest is the induction of the SOS response by antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. Bacteria require topoisomerases such as DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV for DNA replication. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin are able to prevent the action of these molecules by attaching themselves to the gyrate‚ÄìDNA complex, leading to replication fork stall and the induction of the SOS response. The expression of error-prone polymerases under the SOS response increases the basal mutation rate of bacteria. While mutations are often lethal to the cell, they can also enhance survival. In the specific case of topoisomerases, some bacteria have mutated one of their amino acids so that the ciprofloxacin can only create a weak bond to the topoisomerase. This is one of the methods that bacteria use to become resistant to antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin treatment can therefore potentially lead to the generation of mutations that may render bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin. In addition, ciprofloxacin has also been shown to induce via the SOS response dissemination of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants, as well as the activation of integron integrases, potentially increasing the likelihood of acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance by bacteria. Impaired LexA proteolysis has been shown to interfere with ciprofloxacin resistance. This offers potential for combination therapy that combines quinolones with strategies aimed at interfering with the action of LexA, either directly or via RecA. LexA contains a DNA binding domain. The winged HTH motif of LexA is a variant form of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, and it is usually located at the N-terminus of the protein.

It is one of a number of Ba Games played in the streets of towns around Scotland; these are examples of traditional football games which are still played in towns in the United Kingdom and worldwide. Games are played twice a year, normally on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Played in the Royal Burgh of Kirkwall, the two sides are the Uppies and the Doonies, or more correctly, \\"Up-the-Gates\\" and \\"Doon- the-Gates\\" from Norn gata (path or road), although it is also common in Scots. The tradition belongs to Kirkwall and the surrounding area of St Ola, and has always been played by men from those two areas since before records began. In the past 50 years, mainly due to improved transport, the game's popularity has grown to include players from all areas of Orkney, including some of the outer isles. This has not met with universal approval from those associated with the game as its sheer size is becoming a problem from a safety perspective. Scant information is available about the early history but some form of mass football appears to have been practised throughout Scotland and England for at least three centuries. Records from 1797 indicate that \\"Football is the principal diversion of the common people, which they practise with great dexterity\\". There is speculation that the game in Kirkwall may have its roots in folklore based on the tale of Sigurd and the Orkneyinga saga. Boys Ba' The Boys Ba', as the name suggests, is restricted to those aged 15 years and below. There is no restriction on the lower age limit and small boys of sometimes as young as 5 years old can be seen around the edges, making their first tentative steps into the game. The Boys Ba' is thrown up from the Merket Cross on the Kirk Green on front of St Magnus Cathedral at 10.00, the start time recently having been moved from 10.30 due to the Boys Ba' having a tendency to last longer. The Boys game, like the Men's, has grown in size and popularity in recent years and the number of boys participating can number over 100. The Boys Ba' has been known to last as little as 4 minutes (New Years Day 1985) or as long as 6 hours (New Years Day 2019). It can be very fluid, with its outcome often decided by a \\"break\\" whereby one of the faster boys manages to break free of the scrum and runs with the Ba, making valuable ground, sometimes making it all the way to his team's goal, thereby ending the game. Boy's Ba winners, in the sense of the individual boy who is awarded the Ba' after the game as his personal property, will normally be boys playing in their final games prior to turning 16 years old, although there are occasions in history where a younger boy has managed to make off home with it, thereby claiming the Ba as his, despite having further years left to play in the boys game. Nowadays this is generally frowned upon, the conventional wisdom being that younger boys will have other chances to win a Ba, whereas the 15‚Äëyear‚Äëolds will not. Although a great honour, winning a Boy's Ba does not affect status when moving up to the men's game. All young players are considered equal and must prove themselves on their individual performances in the Men's Ba. Indeed, many players who were prominent in the boy's game prove to be otherwise when they step up to the Men's game, and vice versa. Men's Ba' The Men's Ba' is thrown up also from the Merket Cross, when the cathedral bell strikes 13:00. The person chosen to \\"throw up\\" the Ba, or begin the game, is usually an older Ba' stalwart, but the honour is occasionally given to some local public figure. The waiting scrum can number up to 350 men and can be a sight to behold. Once thrown up, the Ba' disappears into the scrum and much surging play occurs while the two sides weigh each other up and determine who has the weight on their side on this occasion. Much exciting surging and turning play often occurs on this wider part of the street, which can frequently determine the final outcome. Occasionally the Ba appears out of the scrum and someone makes a dash through the crowds of spectators. To the casual onlooker this can happen at any moment, but the seasoned Ba watcher can often see what is happening long before the Ba suddenly erupts. Breaks sometimes occur on Broad Street, but can occur anywhere where one side gains sufficient control of part of the scrum. The Doonies have the benefit of a flat push to Albert Street, while the Uppies have a hard push up to the top of Tankerness Lane. The game may also go down one of the flagstone lanes, or down Castle Street onto the open Junction Road. Once there either side may gain the upper hand by means of a smuggle and run, or the scrum may become immobile in one of the many closes and yards. However, if the Uppies manage to enter Victoria Street, or the Doonies Albert Street, the opposition have a much harder time, due to the narrowness and the press of often many hundreds of keen spectators. All the same the Ba may be restricted for several hours in any of the many lanes and neither side ever gives up the struggle until the goal is reached. Women's Ba Immediately after the end of World War II there was a movement to establish a Ba game for women in Kirkwall. There were only ever two Women's Ba games played, on Christmas Day 1945 and New Years Day 1946. The first ever winner of the women's Ba was Barbara Yule who was an uppie. Following her death in 1999 the ball she had kept since she won was returned to Orkney and is on display in Orkney museum in Kirkwall. The second winner was Violet Couper who was also an uppie. The two games played did not follow the pattern of the men's game and were very much running games. The women's game was abolished in subsequent years. History records the reasons for its discontinuation as being a general public dislike for female participation in a very physical and public spectacle, the attitudes of the time being that it was not \\"lady-like\\". Goals The Doonies' goal is the sea, normally within the Basin of the Harbour, but so long as it is immersed in the salt water of Kirkwall Bay, the Ba has gone doon. The Uppies must round the Lang, or Mackinson's corner at the junction of Main Street with New Scapa Road, opposite the Catholic Church, which was the site of the old town gates in bygone times. (The last remains of the town gates were removed in the 1950s, leaving the Uppie goal as the gable end of a house on Mackinson's Corner.) Awarding the Ba Once the Ba has been goaled Up or Doon, lengthy argument often ensues among players on the winning side before a popular individual winner is acclaimed. This winner is awarded the trophy of the game, which is the Ba itself. When the winner is finally decided, he is normally held aloft and carried shoulder-high from the goal by his teammates in celebration, passing into the ranks of Ba winners and into Kirkwall history. To stalwart Ba players the ultimate honour is to be awarded a Ba. To have any chance of this honour, a player generally has to have played consistently well for a long period of time (usually around 20 years minimum). Ba winners range from outstanding players in their early thirties to veterans in their mid to late forties. There are several players who are what is known as a \\"double winner\\" in that they have been awarded both a Boys' Ba and a Men's Ba during their playing careers. Uppie or Doonie? Originally the side any individual played on was decided by whether he was born up or doon the gate but when Kirkwall's Balfour Hospital was built in the 1950s, the majority of babies were born there, thus giving a heavy bias to the Uppies. This led to a swing toward family allegiances, meaning players played the same way as their forebears. This tradition continues to this day. For non-Orcadians or ferryloupers (incomers) or indeed anyone with no family history in the game, and often people from the isles or rural areas, their side is determined by the route taken on their first arrival in Kirkwall. Safety The game has no official rules, but there is a code of honour among players whereby certain acts are considered strictly unacceptable. This code is generally adhered to extremely well by those who play the game and as result the game is self- regulating and self-policing, requiring no intervention from outside parties. The game's popularity in recent times has led to the scrum of men becoming very large with up to 350 men playing at any one time. Forces within the scrum can be enormous, with broken and cracked ribs not uncommon. The scrum will collapse often during the game, at which point players are generally very good at ceasing play and aiding teammate and opponent alike to regain their feet. Camaraderie within the game is excellent, although as with any highly physical male pursuit, tempers can and do flare. Such incidents are quickly extinguished by fellow players and grudges are not held. The participation of visitors in the game is not encouraged, mainly for safety reasons but also as Orcadians are very protective of their tradition and do not wish to see it become a pursuit for \\"adventure tourists\\" as has happened with several other UK traditional ball games. The current scrum has become very large and those associated with the game believe that further players, particularly ones who have no appreciation of the dangers, tactics, allegiances or history of the game, will be no asset from a safety point of view. This view is endorsed almost universally throughout the game.

Poison control centers answer questions about potential poisons in addition to providing treatment management advice about household products, medicines, pesticides, plants, bites and stings, food poisoning, and fumes. In the US, more than 72% of poison exposure cases are managed by phone, greatly reducing the need for costly emergency department and doctor visits.  History  After World War II there was a proliferation of new drugs and chemicals in the marketplace, and consequently suicide and childhood poisonings from these agents drastically increased. Around this time up to half of all accidents in children were poisonings with a substantial number of fatalities. These factors led to the medical community developing a response to both unintentional and intentional poisonings. In Europe in the late 1940s special toxicology wards were set up; initial wards were started in Copenhagen and Budapest, and the Netherlands began a poison information service. In the United States during the 1930s, Louis Gdalman, a pharmacist knowledgeable in the chemistry of harmful substances, set up a poison information service at St. Luke's Hospital (Chicago, Illinois). He became known around Chicago and the country as the person to contact in a poisoning case and would take calls at home around the clock. In the late 1940s, Gdalman began to organize the poison information onto note cards and created a standardized form to collect new information on new toxic substances. By 1953 he had collected an extensive library of information on thousands of poisons and he established the first Poison Control Center along with Edward Press. By 1957 there were 17 poison control centers in the U.S., with the Chicago center serving as a model; these centers dealt mainly with physician enquiries by giving ingredient and toxicity information about products, along with treatment recommendations. Over time the poison control centers started taking calls from the general public. The majority of poison centers were not part of a patient treatment facility; they strictly provided information. In 1958 the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) was founded to promote cooperation between poison centers in different cities and to standardize the operation of these centers. An additional part of the AAPCC's activities was poison prevention and education programs for both physicians and the general public. In 1968 the American Academy of Clinical Toxicologists (AACT) was established by a group of medical doctors. The AACT's main objective was to apply principles of toxicology to patient treatment and improve the standard of care on a national basis. In the 1960s and 1970s a rapid proliferation of poison centers emerged and by 1978 there were 661 centers in the USA. This trend reversed during the 1980s and 1990s with a number of centers closing or merging. In 2000 there were 51 certified centers in the USA. Today there are 55 centers operating in the US. A similar movement evolved in Europe but unlike the American movement the majority were centralized toxicology treatment centers with integrated poison information centers. The French developed an inpatient unit for the treatment of poisoned patients in the late 1950s. In England the National Poison Information Service was developed at Guy's Hospital under Dr Roy Goulding. At around the same time Dr Henry Mathew started a poison treatment center in Edinburgh. In 1964 the European Association for Poison Control Centers was formed at Tours, France. Australasian centers were also established in the 1960s. The New Zealand center started in Dunedin in December 1964, while in Australia, the New South Wales Poisons Information Center was established in 1966. In the EEA, since 2020-2025, hazardous product manufacturers are required to send the formulation of their products to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and to print a Unique formula identifier (UFI) code on their products. This code lets poison centers know the exact formulation of a product, while the formulation is only shared to the ECHA and attached poison control centers.  Today  Poison control centers provide excellent service and savings. Recent research shows that every dollar invested in the poison center system saves $13.39 in health care costs and productivity.https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/member- resources/Value_of_the_Poison_Center_System_FINAL_9_26_2012_-- _FINAL_FINAL_FINAL.pdf While poison control centers have traditionally provided expert consultations by telephone, on 30 December 2014 an online option was launched by a group of U.S. poison centers to meet the growing demand for accurate web-based health information. Based on age, weight and substance implicated, it provides case-specific guidance for poison exposures ‚Äì limited to unintentional, single ingestions of medicines, household products or berries in asymptomatic individuals. The application uses ingredient-based algorithms to generate a recommendation including whether an emergency department visit or call to poison control is required. If it's safe to stay home, then home treatment recommendations, specific symptoms to expect, and symptoms of greater concern that would require a call to poison control or a visit to an emergency department are outlined. Article 45 of the CLP Regulation places the duty upon Member States to appoint \\"bodies responsible for receiving information relating to emergency health response\\". These appointed bodies are often known as Poison Centres.  Countries  = Australia = In Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland have dedicated Poisons Information Centres staffed by specially- trained pharmacists. The Western Australia centre also provides services to South Australia. In Tasmania and other Australian territories, the NSW centre provides equivalent services. All centres are accessed through one number, 13 11 26, and are available 24/7. = Belgium (and Luxembourg) = The Belgian Antipoison Centre (Centre Antipoisons in French, Antigifcentrum in Dutch) is tasked with receiving and answering urgent calls for medical advice regarding cases of poisoning 24/7 and throughout the year. Its hotline can be reached on the telephone number 070 245 245 in Belgium and is available to both medical professionals and the general public. To be able to answer the calls qualitatively, the Antipoison Centre manages a database with formulas of dangerous mixtures provided by the industry, and a database of relevant scientific literature in the field of toxicology. The Antipoison Centre is also responsible for keeping a stock of certain rare or expensive antidotes, and managing a network of hospital pharmacies that also have certain antidotes in stock. Lastly, the Antipoison Centre has a mission of toxicovigilance, meaning it warns relevant authorities (such as the FPS Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment or the FAMHP) about new and emerging risks of chemicals and pharmaceuticals involved in cases of poisoning. Since 2015, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has an agreement with Belgium to have the Antipoison Centre also function as the poison control center for Luxembourg. Medical professionals and members of the public from Luxembourg can reach the Antipoison Centre on the telephone number 8002 5500. = Egypt = The Poison Control Centre of Ain Shams University (PCC-ASU) was established in 1981. It is one of the earliest poisoning treatment facilities to be established in the Middle East. It has its own inpatient department, ICU and Analytical Toxicology unit. It serves between 20 and 25 thousand cases a year. = Germany = German states designate poison control centers. There are currently 8 different centers, some of them serving several states. = India = In April 2018, a Poison Information Center was established in Kolkata, in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at R. G. Kar Medical College. The Center usually caters to patients as well as the doctors from the entire state of West Bengal, in addition to other parts of India. The toll free number is 1800 345 0033. = Italy = The Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (ISS) (National Institute of Health) is responsible for poison control in Italy. = Netherlands = The National Poisons Information Centre (NVIC) of the University Medical Center Utrecht provides a 24/7 hotline service (030-2748888), staffed by poison information specialists (SPIs). It is open to medical professionals only and is not available to the general public. Since 2011 the NVIC also provides a web-based exposure analysis and poison information system.http://www.vergiftigingen.info As with the webPOISONCONTROL system, this is a free-of-charge, fully confidential web application that enables medical professionals to quickly and efficiently assess the potential risks of (mixed) exposures, as well as their clinical signs and symptoms, and possible therapeutic interventions. As with the other online options worldwide, it remains advisable to consult the NVIC if the exposure is to a larger number of substances. The NVIC can, on request, also provide specific training to emergency medical personnel (GMTs), emergency departments, physicians and their assistants, and other interested parties with regards to exposure prevention and management. The NVIC was part of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment until 2011. It was then transferred to the University Medical Center Utrecht. = Palestinian Territories = The Palestinian Poison Control and Drug Information Centre was established in 2006, by Ansam Sawalha. = Saudi Arabia = The poison control department in King Fahad Medical City provides its service for healthcare professionals 24/7 throughout the year. = Sweden = Giftinformationscentralen (Swedish Wikipedia) is responsible for poison control in Sweden. = United Kingdom = The National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) provides toxicological information to health professionals to ensure patients receive appropriate treatment.http://www.npis.org/ NPIS do not take calls from the general public,http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical- classification/classification/poison-centres.htm who are instead advised to contact the non-emergency 111 number for specific information on poisons, or 999 in an emergency. = United States = The American Association of Poison Control Centers manages a 24-hour hotline (1-800-222-1222), which is continuously staffed by pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and poison information specialists who have received dedicated training in the field of toxicology. Calls to the number are automatically routed to the poison control center that covers the territory from which the call is placed. It has a TTY/TDD number for the hearing impaired. Poison educators across the country also offer poison prevention training and education sessions to community institutions, along with educational materials. = Other countries = A worldwide directory of poison centers is available from the World Health Organization's website.

Note the visible break in the ulna. (right forearm) A coronary stent ‚Äî in this case a drug-eluting stent ‚Äî is another common item implanted in humans. An implant is a medical device manufactured to replace a missing biological structure, support a damaged biological structure, or enhance an existing biological structure. Medical implants are man-made devices, in contrast to a transplant, which is a transplanted biomedical tissue. The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone, or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases implants contain electronics e.g. artificial pacemaker and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents.  Applications  Implants can roughly be categorized into groups by application: =Sensory and neurological= Sensory and neurological implants are used for disorders affecting the major senses and the brain, as well as other neurological disorders. They are predominately used in the treatment of conditions such as cataract, glaucoma, keratoconus, and other visual impairments; otosclerosis and other hearing loss issues, as well as middle ear diseases such as otitis media; and neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and treatment-resistant depression. Examples include the intraocular lens, intrastromal corneal ring segment, cochlear implant, tympanostomy tube, and neurostimulator. =Cardiovascular= Cardiovascular medical devices are implanted in cases where the heart, its valves, and the rest of the circulatory system is in disorder. They are used to treat conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia, valvular heart disease, angina pectoris, and atherosclerosis. Examples include the artificial heart, artificial heart valve, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac pacemaker, and coronary stent. =Orthopedic= Orthopaedic implants help alleviate issues with the bones and joints of the body. They're used to treat bone fractures, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, and chronic pain. Examples include a wide variety of pins, rods, screws, and plates used to anchor fractured bones while they heal. Metallic glasses based on magnesium with zinc and calcium addition are tested as the potential metallic biomaterials for biodegradable medical implants.Nowosielski R., Cesarz- Andraczke K., Sakiewicz P., Maciej A., Jak√≥bik-Kolon A., Babilas R., Corrosion of biocompatible Mg66+XZn30-XCa4 (X=0.2) bulk metallic glasses, Arch. Metall. Mater. 2016 vol. 61 iss. 2, s. 807-810 Patient with orthopaedic implants sometimes need to be put under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine for detailed musculoskeletal study. Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the loosening and migration of implant, heating of the implant metal which could cause thermal damage to surrounding tissues, and distortion of the MRI scan that affects the imaging results. A study of orthopaedic implants in 2005 has shown that majority of the orthopaedic implants does not react with magnetic fields under the 1.0 Tesla MRI scanning machine with the exception of external fixator clamps. However, at 7.0 Tesla, several orthopaedic implants would show significant interaction with the MRI magnetic fields, such as heel and fibular implant. = Electric = Electrical implants are being used to relieve pain and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The electric implant is embedded in the neck of patients with rheumatoid arthritics, the implant sends electrical signals to electrodes in the vagus nerve. The application of this device is being tested an alternative to medicating sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis for their lifetime. =Contraception= Contraceptive implants are primarily used to prevent unintended pregnancy and treat conditions such as non-pathological forms of menorrhagia. Examples include copper- and hormone- based intrauterine devices. =Cosmetic= Cosmetic implants ‚Äî often prosthetics ‚Äî attempt to bring some portion of the body back to an acceptable aesthetic norm. They are used as a follow-up to mastectomy due to breast cancer, for correcting some forms of disfigurement, and modifying aspects of the body (as in buttock augmentation and chin augmentation). Examples include the breast implant, nose prosthesis, ocular prosthesis, and injectable filler. =Other organs and systems= AMS 800 and ZSI 375 artificial urinary sphinctersOther types of organ dysfunction can occur in the systems of the body, including the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urological systems. Implants are used in those and other locations to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroparesis, respiratory failure, sleep apnea, urinary and fecal incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. Examples include the LINX, implantable gastric stimulator, diaphragmatic/phrenic nerve stimulator, neurostimulator, surgical mesh, artificial urinary sphincter and penile implant. Classification =United States classification= Medical devices are classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under three different classes depending on the risks the medical device may impose on the user. According to 21CFR 860.3, Class I devices are considered to pose the least amount of risk to the user and require the least amount of control. Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held surgical instruments. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested. Class III devices include replacement heart valves and implanted cerebellar stimulators. Many implants typically fall under Class II and Class III devices. Materials =Commonly implanted metals= A variety of minimally bioreactive metals are routinely implanted. The most commonly implanted form of stainless steel is 316L. Cobalt-chromium and titanium-based implant alloys are also permanently implanted. All of these are made passive by a thin layer of oxide on their surface. A consideration, however, is that metal ions diffuse outward through the oxide and end up in the surrounding tissue. Bioreaction to metal implants includes the formation of a small envelope of fibrous tissue. The thickness of this layer is determined by the products being dissolved, and the extent to which the implant moves around within the enclosing tissue. Pure titanium may have only a minimal fibrous encapsulation. Stainless steel, on the other hand, may elicit encapsulation of as much as 2 mm. =List of implantable metal alloys= Stainless Steel * ASTM F138/F139 316L * ASTM F1314 22Cr-13Ni‚Äì5Mn Titanium Alloy * ASTM F67 Unalloyed (Commercially Pure) Titanium * ASTM F136 Ti-6Al-4V * ASTM F1295 Ti-6Al-7Nb Cobalt Chrome Alloy * ASTM F90 Co-20Cr-15W-10Ni * ASTM F562 Co-35Ni-20Cr-10Mo * ASTM F1537 Co-28Cr-6Mo Tantalum * ASTM F560 Unalloyed Tantalum Complications Complications can arise from implant failure. Internal rupturing of a breast implant can lead to bacterial infection, for example. Under ideal conditions, implants should initiate the desired host response. Ideally, the implant should not cause any undesired reaction from neighboring or distant tissues. However, the interaction between the implant and the tissue surrounding the implant can lead to complications. The process of implantation of medical devices is subjected to the same complications that other invasive medical procedures can have during or after surgery. Common complications include infection, inflammation, and pain. Other complications that can occur include risk of rejection from implant-induced coagulation and allergic foreign body response. Depending on the type of implant, the complications may vary. When the site of an implant becomes infected during or after surgery, the surrounding tissue becomes infected by microorganisms. Three main categories of infection can occur after operation. Superficial immediate infections are caused by organisms that commonly grow near or on skin. The infection usually occurs at the surgical opening. Deep immediate infection, the second type, occurs immediately after surgery at the site of the implant. Skin-dwelling and airborne bacteria cause deep immediate infection. These bacteria enter the body by attaching to the implant's surface prior to implantation. Though not common, deep immediate infections can also occur from dormant bacteria from previous infections of the tissue at the implantation site that have been activated from being disturbed during the surgery. The last type, late infection, occurs months to years after the implantation of the implant. Late infections are caused by dormant blood-borne bacteria attached to the implant prior to implantation. The blood-borne bacteria colonize on the implant and eventually get released from it. Depending on the type of material used to make the implant, it may be infused with antibiotics to lower the risk of infections during surgery. However, only certain types of materials can be infused with antibiotics, the use of antibiotic-infused implants runs the risk of rejection by the patient since the patient may develop a sensitivity to the antibiotic, and the antibiotic may not work on the bacteria. Inflammation, a common occurrence after any surgical procedure, is the body's response to tissue damage as a result of trauma, infection, intrusion of foreign materials, or local cell death, or as a part of an immune response. Inflammation starts with the rapid dilation of local capillaries to supply the local tissue with blood. The inflow of blood causes the tissue to become swollen and may cause cell death. The excess blood, or edema, can activate pain receptors at the tissue. The site of the inflammation becomes warm from local disturbances of fluid flow and the increased cellular activity to repair the tissue or remove debris from the site. Implant-induced coagulation is similar to the coagulation process done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from proteins that become attached to the implant surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack the implant to remove the foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where the implant is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate the implant as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating the implant in fibrinogen and platelets. The encapsulation of the implant can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent the implant from performing the desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics may not be able to reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove the bacteria, the implant would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of the implant and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, the implant would have to be removed. Failures The many examples of implant failure include rupture of silicone breast implants, hip replacement joints, and artificial heart valves, such as the Bjork‚ÄìShiley valve, all of which have caused FDA intervention. The consequences of implant failure depend on the nature of the implant and its position in the body. Thus, heart valve failure is likely to threaten the life of the individual, while breast implant or hip joint failure is less likely to be life- threatening. Devices implanted directly in the grey matter of the brain produce the highest quality signals, but are prone to scar-tissue build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain. In 2018, Implant files, an investigation made by ICIJ revealed that medical devices that are unsafe and have not been adequately tested were implanted in patients' bodies. In United Kingdom, Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, concludes: \\"All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term.\\"  See also  * Biofunctionalisation * Implantable devices * List of orthopedic implants * Medical device * Prosthesis * Implant Files scandal by ICIJ, November 2018.

The animals are less than ¬Ω mm wide, with sac- like bodies, and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their three-stage life cycle. Classification and naming They are so unlike any known animal that its discovery by Danish scientists in 1995 led to the creation of a new phylum. The phylum Cycliophora, from the Greek for 'carrying a small wheel', was named after the creature's circular mouth. Two other members of that phylum have since been discovered. Symbion refers to the animal's symbiotic relationship with its lobster host while the specific epithet pandora refers to the part of the organism's life cycle that reminded Funch and Christensen of the mythical Pandora's box. Description Symbion pandora has a bilateral, sac-like body with no coelom. There are three basic life stages: *Asexual feeding stage ‚Äì At this stage, S. pandora is neither male nor female. It has a length of 347 Œºm and a width of 113 Œºm. On the posterior end of the sac-like body is a stalk with an adhesive disc, which attaches itself to the host. On the anterior end is a ciliated funnel (mouth) and an anus. *Sexual stage **Female ‚Äì S. pandora has a length of 84 Œºm and a width of 42 Œºm during this stage. Its digestive system collapses and reconstitutes itself as a larva. **Male ‚Äì S. pandora is the same size as the female in this stage. It has no mouth or anus, which signifies the absence of a digestive system. It also has two reproductive organs. Reproduction Symbion pandora can reproduce both asexually by budding and sexually. The sexual reproductive cycle is triggered when the host crustacean molts its skin in order to grow: a feeding stage buds a male, which attaches to another feeding stage and triggers it to bud a female, which it impregnates. The female is able to swim, and finds another host crustacean, where the larva in her develops. The female dies, and the larva escapes, spawning another feeding stage on the new host.

Born in Washington, North Carolina, Bonner attended school in Warrenton. He served in the United States Army during World War I, and worked as a salesman, a farmer, and then as secretary to Congressman Lindsay Warren from 1924 to 1940. Upon Warren's resignation from Congress in 1940, Bonner was elected simultaneously to complete the unexpired term, and was elected to the 77th Congress for a full term. He served for twelve full terms, from November 5, 1940 until his death from cancer in Washington, D.C. on November 7, 1965. During the 79th Congress, he chaired the Committee on Election of President, Vice President, and Representatives in Congress, and in the 84th through 89th Congresses, he chaired the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. Bonner died in office in 1965 in Washington, D.C.; he is buried in Washington, N.C. Legacy A former bridge spanning Oregon Inlet on the Outer Banks was named in honor of him and his service to the state of North Carolina. When the bridge was replaced in 2019, 1,000 ft of the Bonner bridge was left to be used a pier and retains the Bonner name. The M/V Herbert C. Bonner, a 25 car ferry was also named for him. The 112 ft. vessel was built in 1970 for the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division to cross Hatteras Inlet between Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands on the outer banks of North Carolina.The ferry was taken out of service and sold by NCDOT. The Bonner was purchased by A&R; Marine and now operates on Narragansett Bay where it crosses between Bristol and Prudence Island. Bonner was the namesake of the former Herbert C. Bonner Scout Reservation, commonly known as \\"Camp Bonner\\", located near Washington, NC. This is now known as the East Carolina Scout Reservation.

The revenue recognition principle is the basis of making adjusting entries that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under accrual-basis accounting. They are sometimes called Balance Day adjustments because they are made on balance day. Based on the matching principle of accrual accounting, revenues and associated costs are recognized in the same accounting period. However the actual cash may be received or paid at a different time. Types of adjusting entries Most adjusting entries could be classified this way: { border=\\"0\\" ----- align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"cadetblue\\"  width=\\"10%\\"   width=\\"44%\\"  Prepayments (Deferral - cash paid or received before consumption)  Accrual - cash paid or received after consumption -----  bgcolor=\\"cadetblue\\"  Expenses  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"tan\\"  Prepaid expenses: for expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"tan\\"  Accrued expenses: for expenses incurred but not yet paid in cash and not yet recorded -----  bgcolor=\\"cadetblue\\"  Revenues  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  Unearned revenue: for revenues received in cash and recorded as liabilities before they are earned  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"silver\\"  Accrued revenues: for revenues earned but not yet recorded and not yet received in cash } =Prepayments= Adjusting entries for prepayments are necessary to account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services. When this cash is paid, it is first recorded in a prepaid expense asset account; the account is to be expensed either with the passage of time (e.g. rent, insurance) or through use and consumption (e.g. supplies). A company receiving the cash for benefits yet to be delivered will have to record the amount in an unearned revenue liability account. Then, an adjusting entry to recognize the revenue is used as necessary. Example Assume a magazine publishing company charges an annual subscription fee of $12. The cash is paid up-front at the start of the subscription. The income, based on sales basis method, is recognized upon delivery. Therefore, the initial reporting of the receipt of annual subscription fee is indicated as: Debit  Credit \\\\---------------- Cash $12  Unearned Revenue  $12  The adjusting entry reporting each month after the delivery is: Debit  Credit \\\\---------------- Unearned Revenue $1  Revenue  $1  The unearned revenue after the first month is therefore $11 and revenue reported in the income statement is $1. =Accruals= Accrued revenues are revenues that have been recognized (that is, services have been performed or goods have been delivered), but their cash payment have not yet been recorded or received. When the revenue is recognized, it is recorded as a receivable. Accrued expenses have not yet been paid for, so they are recorded in a payable account. Expenses for interest, taxes, rent, and salaries are commonly accrued for reporting purposes. An income which has been earned but it has not been received yet during the accounting period. Incomes like rent, interest on investments, commission etc. are examples of accrued income. =Estimates= A third classification of adjusting entry occurs where the exact amount of an expense cannot easily be determined. The depreciation of fixed assets, for example, is an expense which has to be estimated. The entry for bad debt expense can also be classified as an estimate. =Inventory= In a periodic inventory system, an adjusting entry is used to determine the cost of goods sold expense. This entry is not necessary for a company using perpetual inventory.

The oft-quoted one relates to a poor village boy nicknamed Gouzhai. At 14, he became an apprentice at a food store. Thereafter, he set up his own shop specialising in selling steamed, stuffed baozi. His supposedly very delicious baozi soon gained immense popularity in a short period of time. As a result, Gouzhai got too preoccupied with his business to converse with his customers. So, they started to complain, \\"Gouzhai does not talk to people.\\" (which loosely translates as ). In another similar story, there was a boy named Gao Guiyou who had a terrible attitude and could ignore people for days if he was angered. Thus, he was named by his mother Goubuli (his nickname \\"Gou\\" with \\"Buli\\" meaning \\"ignores\\"). At 14, Gou was sent by his father to Tianjin where he gained apprenticeship at a food shop and, after mastering his skills, setup his own shop named \\"Goubuli\\".

Common kinds of compositions are objects used in object-oriented programming, tagged unions, sets, sequences, and various graph structures. Object compositions relate to, but are not the same as, data structures. Object composition refers to the logical or conceptual structure of the information, not the implementation or physical data structure used to represent it. For example, a sequence differs from a set because (among other things) the order of the composed items matters for the former but not the latter. Data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and many others can be used to implement either of them. Perhaps confusingly, some of the same terms are used for both data structures and composites. For example, \\"binary tree\\" can refer to either: as a data structure it is a means of accessing a linear sequence of items, and the actual positions of items in the tree are irrelevant (the tree can be internally rearranged however one likes, without changing its meaning). However, as an object composition, the positions are relevant, and changing them would change the meaning (as for example in cladograms).  Programming technique  Object-oriented programming is based on objects to encapsulate data and behavior. It uses two main techniques for assembling and composing functionality into more complex ones, sub-typing and object composition. Object composition is about the combining objects within compound objects, and at the same time, ensuring the encapsulation of each object by using their well-defined interface without visbility of their internals. In this regard, object composition differs from data structures, which do not enforce encapsulation. Object composition may also be about a group of multiple related objects, such as a set or a sequence of objects. Delegation may enrich composition by forwarding requests or calls made to the enclosing composite object to one of its internal components. In class-based and typed programming languages, types can be divided into composite and non-composite types, and composition can be regarded as a relationship between types: an object of a composite type (e.g. car) \\"has\\" objects of other types (e.g. wheel). When a composite object contains several sub-objects of the same type, they may be assigned to particular roles, often distinguished by names or numbers. For example, a Point object might contain 3 numbers, each representing distance along a different axis, such as 'x', 'y', and 'z'. The study of part-whole relationships in general, is mereology. Composition must be distinguished from subtyping, which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type. For instance, cars may be a specific type of vehicle: car is a vehicle. Subtyping doesn't describe a relationship between different objects, but instead, says that objects of a type are simultaneously objects of another type. The study of such relationships is ontology. In prototype-based programming languages such as JavaScript, objects can dynamically inherit the behaviors from a prototype object at the moment of their instantiation. Composition must be distinguished from prototyping: the newly instantiated object inherits the composition of its prototype, but it may itself be composed on its own. Composite objects may be represented in storage by co-locating the composed objects, by co-locating references, or in many other ways. The items within a composite object may be referred to as attributes, fields, members, properties, or other names, and the resulting composition as composite type, storage record, structure, tuple, or a user-defined type (UDT). For details, see the aggregation section below. UML modeling technique Object composition using UML properties to compose objects In UML modeling, objects can be conceptually composed, independently of the implementation with a programming language. There are four ways of composing objects in UML: property, association, aggregation and composition: * A property represents an attribute of the class. * An association represents a semantic relationship between instances of the associated classes. The member-end of an association corresponds to a property of the associated class. * An aggregation is a kind of association that models a part/whole relationship between an aggregate (whole) and a group of related components (parts). * A composition, also called a composite aggregation, is a kind of aggregation that models a part/whole relationship between a composite (whole) and a group of an exclusively owned parts. The relationship between the aggregate and its components is a weak \\"has-a\\" relationship: The components may be part of several aggregates, may be accessed through other objects without going through the aggregate, and may outlive the aggregate object. The state of the component object still forms part of the aggregate object. The relationship between the composite and its parts is a strong ‚Äúhas-a‚Äù relationship: The composite object has sole \\"responsibility for the existence and storage of the composed objects\\", the composed object can be part of at most one composite, and \\"If a composite object is deleted, all of its part instances that are objects are deleted with it\\". Thus in UML, composition has a more narrow meaning than the usual object composition. UML notation for association, composition and aggregation The graphical notation represents: * the property as a typed element in the box of the enclosing class, * the association as a plain line between the associated classes, * the aggregation as an unfilled diamond on the side of the aggregate and a solid line, * the composition as a filled diamond on the side of the composite and a solid line.  Special forms  =Containment= Composition that is used to store several instances of the composited data type is referred to as containment. Examples of such containers are arrays, associative arrays, binary trees, and linked lists. In UML, containment is depicted with a multiplicity of 0..* or 1..*, indicating that the composite object is composed of an unknown number of instances of the composed class. =Recursive composition= Objects can be composed recursively, and their type is then called recursive type. Examples includes various kinds of trees, DAGs, and graphs. Each node in a tree may be a branch or leaf; in other words, each node is a tree at the same time when it belongs to another tree. In UML, recursive composition is depicted with an association, aggregation or composition of a class with itself. = Composite pattern = The composite design pattern is an object oriented design based on composite types, that combines recursive composition and containment to implement complex part-whole hierarchies. Composite types in C This is an example of composition in C. struct Person { int age; char name[20]; enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student} employment; }; In this example, the primitive (noncomposite) types \`int\`, \`enum {job_seeking, professional, non_professional, retired, student}\` and the composite array type \`char[]\` are combined to form the composite structure \`Person\`. Each \`Person\` structure then \\"has an\\" age, name, and an employment type. Timeline of composition in various languages C calls a record a struct or structure; object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk, and C++ often keep their records hidden inside objects (class instances); languages in the ML family simply call them records. COBOL was the first widespread programming language to support records directly; ALGOL 68 got it from COBOL and Pascal got it, more or less indirectly, from ALGOL 68. Common Lisp provides structures and classes (the latter via the Common Lisp Object System). ;1959 ‚Äì COBOL 01 customer-record. 03 customer-number pic 9(8) comp. 03 customer-name. 05 given- names pic x(15). 05 initial-2 pic x. 05 surname pic x(15). 03 customer- address. 05 street. 07 street-name pic x(15). 09 house-number pic 999 comp. 05 city pic x(10). 05 country-code pic x(3). 05 postcode pic x(8). 03 amount- owing pic 9(8) comp. ;1960 ‚Äì ALGOL 60 Arrays were the only composite data type in Algol 60. ;1964 ‚Äì PL/I dcl 1 newtypet based (P); 2 (a, b, c) fixed bin(31), 2 (i, j, k) float, 2 r ptr; allocate newtypet; ;1968 ‚Äì ALGOL 68 int max = 99; mode newtypet = [0..9] [0..max]struct ( long real a, b, c, short int i, j, k, ref real r ); newtypet newarrayt = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, heap real := 7) For example, a linked list might be declared as: mode node = union (real, int, compl, string), list = struct (node val, ref list next); For ALGOL 68 only the type name appears to the left of the equality, and most notably the construction is made ‚Äì and can be read ‚Äì from left to right without regard to priorities. ;1970 ‚Äì Pascal type a = array [1..10] of integer; b = record a, b, c: real; i, j, k: integer; end; ;1972 ‚Äì K&R; C #define max 99 struct newtypet { double a, b, c; float r; short i, j, k; } newarrayt[10] [max + 1]; ;1977 ‚Äì FORTRAN 77 Fortran 77 has arrays, but lacked any formal record/structure definitions. Typically compound structures were built up using \`EQUIVALENCE\` or \`COMMON\` statements: CHARACTER NAME*32, ADDR*32, PHONE*16 REAL OWING COMMON /CUST/NAME, ADDR, PHONE, OWING ;1983 ‚Äì Ada type Cust is record Name : Name_Type; Addr : Addr_Type; Phone : Phone_Type; Owing : Integer range 1..999999; end record; Ada 95 brought OOP concepts through tagged types (the equivalent of a C++ class), Ada 2012 added support for substitution verification through class-wide contracts. ;1983 ‚Äì C++ const int max = 99; class { public: double a, b, c; float &r; short i, j, k; }newtypet[10] [max + 1]; ;1991 ‚Äì Python max = 99 class NewTypeT: def __init__(self): self.a = self.b = self.c = 0 self.i = self.j = self.k = 0.0 # Initialise an example array of this class. newarrayt = NewTypeT() for i in range(max + 1)] for j in range(10)] ;1992 ‚Äì FORTRAN 90 Arrays and strings were inherited from FORTRAN 77, and a new reserved word was introduced: type type newtypet double precision a, b, c integer*2 i, j, k * No pointer type REF REAL R end type type (newtypet) t(10, 100) FORTRAN 90 updated and included FORTRAN IV's concept called NAMELIST. INTEGER :: jan = 1, feb = 2, mar = 3, apr = 4 NAMELIST / week / jan, feb, mar, apr ;1994 ‚Äì ANSI Common Lisp Common Lisp provides structures and the ANSI Common Lisp standard added CLOS classes. (defclass some-class () ((f :type float) (i :type integer) (a :type (array integer (10))))) For more details about composition in C/C++, see Composite type. Aggregation Aggregation differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply ownership. In composition, when the owning object is destroyed, so are the contained objects. In aggregation, this is not necessarily true. For example, a university owns various departments (e.g., chemistry), and each department has a number of professors. If the university closes, the departments will no longer exist, but the professors in those departments will continue to exist. Therefore, a University can be seen as a composition of departments, whereas departments have an aggregation of professors. In addition, a Professor could work in more than one department, but a department could not be part of more than one university. Composition is usually implemented such that an object contains another object. For example, in C++: class Professor; // Defined elsewhere class Department { public: Department(const std::string& title): title_(title) {} private: // Aggregation: Professors may outlive the Department. std::vector> members_; const std::string title_; }; class University { public: University() = default; private: // Composition: Departments exist only as long as the faculty exists. std::vector faculty_ = { Department(\\"chemistry\\"), Department(\\"physics\\"), Department(\\"arts\\"), }; }; In aggregation, the object may only contain a reference or pointer to the object (and not have lifetime responsibility for it). Sometimes aggregation is referred to as composition when the distinction between ordinary composition and aggregation is unimportant. The above code would transform into the following UML Class diagram: 417px =Aggregation in COM= Aggregation in COM In Microsoft's Component Object Model, aggregation means that an object exports, as if it were their owner, one or several interfaces of another object it owns. Formally, this is more similar to composition or encapsulation than aggregation. However, instead of implementing the exported interfaces by calling the interfaces of the owned object, the interfaces of the owned object themselves are exported. The owned object is responsible for assuring that methods of those interfaces inherited from \`IUnknown\` actually invoke the corresponding methods of the owner. This is to guarantee that the reference count of the owner is correct and all interfaces of the owner are accessible through the exported interface, while no other (private) interfaces of the owned object are accessible.

Crotty (born August 30, 1948 in Dobbs Ferry, New York) is the former Mayor of Orange County, Florida, United States.  Biography  Crotty grew up in Orlando. He graduated from Valencia Community College in 1970 and University of Central Florida in 1972, and he also attended Florida State University.Educational background After three years doing waste manage consultation under contract from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, he was selected to the Orlando Chamber of Commerce's first \\"Leadership Orlando\\" program. In 1978, he was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives. Later he served in the Florida Senate as the Republican Floor Leader. The first piece of legislation he co-sponsored was the law that changed the name of FTU, his alma mater, to the University of Central Florida. He was the prime sponsor of the law that created the \\"Florida Prepaid College Tuition Program\\", the first and largest of its kind in the United States. One of the last pieces of legislation he sponsored was the \\"Junny Rios-Martinez Act\\" in 1992, named after the victim of former Florida Death Row inmate Mark Dean Schwab, which denied parole and early release to violent sexual predators. After 14 years of service in Tallahassee, Crotty returned to Orlando and was elected the Orange County Property Appraiser in 1992. He began the upgrade of the office to include modern personal computer technology in its tasks. On January 23, 2001, after the confirmation of Orange County Chairman (former name of the position of Mayor) Mel Martinez as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Florida Governor Jeb Bush appointed Crotty to replace Martinez. Crotty was subsequently elected to the position in 2002, and re-elected in 2006, receiving 73% and 70% of the vote, respectively. The position of Orange County Mayor carries a term limit of two terms, but since Crotty was appointed in the latter half of Martinez's term, he was permitted to run for two full terms. On September 10, 2010, it was confirmed that Armando Gutierrez and Crotty had negotiated the potential move of the Tampa Yankees to Orlando. Crotty was a key supporter of an aggressive expansion project for Orange County Public Schools, which was passed by Orange County voters in 2002. Crotty was a significant fundraiser for George W. Bush during the 2004 election.

Like the usual composition of functions in mathematics, the result of each function is passed as the argument of the next, and the result of the last one is the result of the whole. Programmers frequently apply functions to results of other functions, and almost all programming languages allow it. In some cases, the composition of functions is interesting as a function in its own right, to be used later. Such a function can always be defined but languages with first-class functions make it easier. The ability to easily compose functions encourages factoring (breaking apart) functions for maintainability and code reuse. More generally, big systems might be built by composing whole programs. Narrowly speaking, function composition applies to functions that operate on a finite amount of data, each step sequentially processing it before handing it to the next. Functions that operate on potentially infinite data (a stream or other codata) are known as filters, and are instead connected in a pipeline, which is analogous to function composition and can execute concurrently. Composing function calls For example, suppose we have two functions f and g, as in z=f(y) and y=g(x). Composing them means we first compute y=g(x), and then use y to compute z=f(y). Here is the example in the C language: float x, y, z; // ... y = g(x); z = f(y); The steps can be combined if we don't give a name to the intermediate result: z = f(g(x)); Despite differences in length, these two implementations compute the same result. The second implementation requires only one line of code and is colloquially referred to as a \\"highly composed\\" form. Readability and hence maintainability is one advantage of highly composed forms, since they require fewer lines of code, minimizing a program's \\"surface area\\"., pp. 15‚Äì17 DeMarco and Lister empirically verify an inverse relationship between surface area and maintainability., pp. 133‚Äì135. On the other hand, it may be possible to overuse highly composed forms. A nesting of too many functions may have the opposite effect, making the code less maintainable. In a stack-based language, functional composition is even more natural: it is performed by concatenation, and is usually the primary method of program design. The above example in Forth: g f Which will take whatever was on the stack before, apply g, then f, and leave the result on the stack. See postfix composition notation for the corresponding mathematical notation. Naming the composition of functions Now suppose that the combination of calling f() on the result of g() is frequently useful, and which we want to name foo() to be used as a function in its own right. In most languages, we can define a new function implemented by composition. Example in C: float foo(float x) { return f(g(x)); } (the long form with intermediates would work as well.) Example in Forth: : foo g f ; In languages such as C, the only way to create a new function is to define it in the program source, which means that functions can't be composed at run time. An evaluation of an arbitrary composition of predefined functions, however, is possible: #include typedef int FXN(int); int f(int x) { return x+1; } int g(int x) { return x*2; } int h(int x) { return x-3; } int eval(FXN *fs[], int size, int x) { for (int i=0; i First-class composition In functional programming languages, function composition can be naturally expressed as a higher-order function or operator. In other programming languages you can write your own mechanisms to perform function composition. =Haskell= In Haskell, the example given above becomes: foo = f . g using the built-in composition operator (.), which can be read as f after g or g composed with f. The composition operator itself can be defined in Haskell using a lambda expression: (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c f . g = \\\\x -> f (g x) The first lines describes the type of (.) - it takes a pair of functions and returns a function. Note that Haskell doesn't require specification of the exact input and output types of f and g, only the relations between them (f must accept what g returns). This makes (.) a polymorphic operator. =Lisp= Variants of Lisp, especially Scheme, the interchangeability of code and data together with the treatment of functions lend themselves extremely well for a recursive definition of a variadic compositional operator. (define (compose . fs) (if (null? fs) (lambda (x) x) ; if no argument is given, evaluates to the identity function (lambda (x) ((car fs) ((apply compose (cdr fs)) x))))) ; examples (define (add-a-bang str) (string-append str \\"!\\")) (define givebang (compose string->symbol add-a-bang symbol->string)) (givebang 'set) ; => set! ; anonymous composition ((compose sqrt negate square) 5) ; => 0+5i =APL= Many dialects of APL feature built in function composition using the symbol \`‚àò\`. This higher-order function extends function composition to dyadic application of the left side function such that \`A f‚àòg B\` is \`A f g B\`. foo‚Üêf‚àòg Additionally, you can define function composition: o‚Üê{‚ç∫‚ç∫ ‚çµ‚çµ ‚çµ} In dialect that does not support inline definition using braces, the traditional definition is available: ‚àá r‚Üê(f o g)x r‚Üêf g x ‚àá =Raku= Raku like Haskell has a built in function composition operator, the main difference is it is spelled as \`‚àò\` or \`o\`. my &foo; = &f; ‚àò &g; Also like Haskell you could define the operator yourself. In fact the following is the Raku code used to define it in the Rakudo implementation. # the implementation has a slightly different line here because it cheats proto sub infix:<‚àò> (&?, &?) is equiv(&[~]) is assoc {*} multi sub infix:<‚àò> () { *.self } # allows \`[‚àò] @array\` to work when \`@array\` is empty multi sub infix:<‚àò> (&f;) { &f; } # allows \`[‚àò] @array\` to work when \`@array\` has one element multi sub infix:<‚àò> (&f;, &g; \\\\--> Block) { (&f;).count > 1 ?? -> args { f g args } !! -> args { f g args } } # alias it to the \\"Texas\\" spelling ( everything is bigger, and ASCII in Texas ) my &infix;: := &infix;:<‚àò>; =Python= In Python, a way to define the composition for any group of functions, is using reduce function (use functools.reduce in Python 3): # Available since Python v2.6 from functools import reduce def compose(*funcs) -> int: \\"\\"\\"Compose a group of functions (f(g(h(...)))) into a single composite func.\\"\\"\\" return reduce(lambda f, g: lambda x: f(g(x)), funcs) # Example f = lambda x: x + 1 g = lambda x: x * 2 h = lambda x: x - 3 # Call the function x=10 : ((x-3)*2)+1 = 15 print(compose(f, g, h)(10)) =JavaScript= In JavaScript we can define it as a function which takes two functions f and g, and produces a function: function o(f, g) { return function(x) { return f(g(x)); } } // Alternatively, using the rest operator and lambda expressions in ES2015 const compose = (...fs) => (x) => fs.reduceRight((acc, f) => f(acc), x) =C#= In C# we can define it as a Func which takes two Funcs f and g, and produces a Func: // Call example: // var c = Compose(f, g); // // Func g = _ => ... // Func f = _ => ... Func Compose(Func f, Func g) => _ => f(g(_)); =Ruby= Languages like Ruby let you construct a binary operator yourself: class Proc def compose(other_fn) ->(*as) { other_fn.call(call(*as)) } end alias_method :+, :compose end f = ->(x) { x * 2 } g = ->(x) { x ** 3 } (f + g).call(12) # => 13824 However, a native function composition operator was introduced in Ruby 2.6: f = proc{x x + 2} g = proc{x x * 3} (f << g).call(3) # -> 11; identical to f(g(3)) (f >> g).call(3) # -> 15; identical to g(f(3)) Research survey Notions of composition, including the principle of compositionality and composability, are so ubiquitous that numerous strands of research have separately evolved. The following is a sampling of the kind of research in which the notion of composition is central. * directly applied function composition to the assemblage of building blocks known as 'monads' in the Haskell programming language. * addressed the software reuse problem in terms of composability. * formally defined a proof rule for functional composition that assures a program's safety and liveness. * identified a strengthened form of compositionality by placing it into a semiotic system and applying it to the problem of structural ambiguity frequently encountered in computational linguistics. * examined the role of compositionality in analog aspects of natural language processing. *According to a review by , formal treatment of composition underlies validation of component assembly in visual programming languages like IBM's Visual Age for the Java language. Large-scale composition Whole programs or systems can be treated as functions, which can be readily composed if their inputs and outputs are well-defined pipelines allowing easy composition of filters were so successful that it became a design pattern of operating systems. Imperative procedures with side effects violate referential transparency and therefore are not cleanly composable. However if you consider the \\"state of the world\\" before and after running the code as its input and output, you get a clean function. Composition of such functions corresponds to running the procedures one after the other. The monads formalism uses this idea to incorporate side effects and I/O into functional languages.

They are native to the island of Madagascar, which is off the African mainland, where they are known to be found inside of rotting logs. It is one of some 20 known species of large hissing roaches from Madagascar, many of which are kept as pets, and often confused with one another by pet dealers; in particular, G. portentosa is commonly confused with G. oblongonota and G. picea.Delfosse, E. (2004) Les blattes souffleuses de Madagascar. Insectes 153: 19-22. Unlike most cockroaches, they are wingless. They are excellent climbers and can scale smooth glass. Males can be distinguished from females by their thicker, hairier antennae and the very pronounced \\"horns\\" on the pronotum. Females carry the ootheca internally, and release the young nymphs only after her offspring have emerged within her. As in some other wood-inhabiting roaches, the parents and offspring will commonly remain in close physical contact for extended periods of time. In captivity, these insects have been known to live up to 5 years. They feed primarily on vegetable material. Hissing As the common name suggests, the Madagascar hissing cockroach is characterized by their hissing sound, which is produced when they forcefully expel air through the specially-adapted respiratory openings (spiracles) on the fourth segment of their body, though spiracles are found on all segments of their abdomen. The Madagascar hissing cockroach is only one member of a group of roaches that can hiss; this exact mode of sound production is atypical, as most insects that make sound do so by rubbing together various body parts (\\"stridulation\\"), such as legs. Some long-horned beetles, e.g., the giant Fijian long-horned beetle, hiss by squeezing air out from under their elytra, but this does not involve the spiracles. In hissing roaches, the hiss takes three forms: the disturbance hiss, the female- attracting hiss, and the aggressive fighting hiss. All cockroaches from the fourth instar (fourth molting cycle) and older are capable of the disturbance hiss. Only males use the female-attracting hiss and fighting hiss; the latter is used when challenged by other males (males will establish a dominance hierarchy, and a submissive male will back down to end a fight). The hissing makes them a popular pet. Associations with other animals Hissing cockroach The mite species Gromphadorholaelaps schaeferi lives on this species of cockroach along the undersides and bases of the legs and takes some of its host's food as well as consuming particulates along the host's body. As these mites do not harm the cockroaches they live upon, they are commensals, not parasites, unless they build up to abnormal levels and start starving their host. Recent studies have shown that these mites also may have beneficial qualities for the cockroaches, in that they clean the surfaces of the cockroaches of pathogenic mold spores, which in turn increases the life expectancy of the cockroaches. Popular culture The Madagascar hissing cockroach has been known to be featured in Hollywood movies, prominently in Bug (1975) as cockroaches who could set fires by rubbing their legs together and, in Damnation Alley (1977), as post-nuclear-war mutant armor-plated \\"killer\\" cockroaches. In Starship Troopers, a movie about a war against an enemy called \\"The Bugs\\", a teacher is shown encouraging her students to step on this species as part of a TV propaganda broadcast. A Madagascar hissing cockroach was used by artist Garnet Hertz as the driver of a mobile robotic artwork. They were frequently used in the reality television series Fear Factor, where in one episode of the 2002 series, featuring Celebrities competing for charity, the host, Joe Rogan, ate one as part of a wager with contestant Alison Sweeney of \\"Days of Our Lives\\" after she had what Rogan has since described as 'the greatest freak-out in \\"Fear Factor\\" history' after panicking during a stunt. While normally she would be eliminated, as the show was for charity, it was decided that if she ate 3 worms she would advance to the final stunt regardless. In addition, Rogan would eat a cockroach as part of the bet. The species also made an appearance in the movie Men in Black in 1997. This was later parodied in the comedy Team America: World Police (2004), where one emerges from Kim Jong-il's body after his death, enters a tiny spaceship, and flies away. thumb In September 2006, amusement park Six Flags Great America announced that it would be granting unlimited line-jumping privileges for all rides to anyone who could eat a live Madagascar hissing cockroach as part of a Halloween-themed FrightFest. Furthermore, if a contestant managed to beat the previous world record (eating 36 cockroaches in 1 minute), he would receive season passes for four people during the 2007 season. Raw cockroaches contain a mild neurotoxin that numbs the mouth and makes it difficult to swallow. The promotion ended on October 29, 2006. In January 2016 and 2017, Bronx Zoo held a roach-naming program themed for Valentine's Day, allowing their cockroaches to be named by benefactors. Funds raised were donated to Wildlife Conservation Society. As pets Hissing roaches kept as pets Madagascar cockroaches can be kept as exotic pets. They require a small living area with an area for them to hide because they dislike light sources. The cockroaches prefer warmth and they cannot function in cold weather. Due to their propensity to climb, the living area must be tested to see if they can climb it as they do in their natural environment. Fish tanks with screens work best but it is also wise to coat the first few inches with petroleum jelly to keep them from getting out of the habitat that they are kept in. They can live on fresh vegetables along with any kind of pellet food that is high in protein, such as dry dog food. In the USA, some states require permits before this species can be kept as a pet or in breeding colonies. The state of Florida requires such a permit. In fact, during outreach programs, the University of Florida's Department of Entomology and Nematology, which has such a permit, allows only males to be taken out of the laboratory. This is to prevent the possible introduction of a pregnant female into the environment. It is also possible to raise them to feed other pets, as they are reasonably high in protein. Reptiles are often given roaches as food.

His son, Chip Sansom, who started assisting on the strip in 1989, is the current artist. The strip is distributed by Newspaper Enterprise Association. The Sansoms won the 1987 National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award and the 1990 Newspaper Comic Strip Award.NCS Awards National Cartoonist Society, 2008, Retrieved November 30, 2010 History Art Sansom created The Born Loser after spending 20 years churning out the illustrations on his syndicate's serious strips. He originally titled it The Loser, but under the urging of the syndicate, renamed it The Born Loser. The dailies started May 10, 1965 while the Sundays premiered on June 27. Initially, the strip had no recurring characters but now focuses on the Thornapple family and the few people in their lives. Characters  =Main characters= Brutus P. \\"Thorny\\" Thornapple ‚Äì As the name of the comic implies, he's a born loser. He simply can't get a break, whether it involves his job, his family, or just plain every day life. He's rather old fashioned, perhaps explaining why the modern times seem to be running him over. His birthday is November 29, 1951, though the May 10, 2011 edition proclaimed it to be his 46th birthday. Gladys \\"Hornet\\" Thornapple ‚Äì Brutus's wife, she's even more old fashioned than Brutus and doesn't seem to be very bright, especially with popular culture or technology. Taller than Brutus, with blond hair, she's rather similar to Edith \\"Dingbat\\" Bunker. She can be a bit scolding of Brutus, and often gets into fights with him that he simply cannot win. Nevertheless, their relationship always seems to be intact. Wilberforce Thornapple ‚Äì The son of the Thornapple family, he's a very curious boy who looks up to his father and often turns to him for advice. He is friends with his neighbor Hurricane Hattie, and enjoys baseball, but he's not very good at it. He currently wears his blond hair in a crew cut but in the 1970s, when boys and men tended to wear much longer hair, he wore his hair in sausage curls, and wore sailor-type suits with shorts. His appearance looked much more boyish with the new hairstyle as his wardrobe was updated with jeans, sweatshirts, and tennis shoes. =Secondary characters= Rancid W. \\"Rank\\" Veeblefester ‚Äì Brutus's boss, a rich tycoon. A very cranky, unpleasant man, he works in an office surrounded by money bags and doesn't seem to do any real work. He always scolds Brutus for being incompetent and seems to enjoy tormenting him. He loves to give a seemingly nice remark to Brutus to get his hopes up, and then turns it around as an insult (one example being that the only empty cubicle in the entire office belongs to Brutus). It's often a wonder how Brutus, who dubs him \\"Chief,\\" manages to escape being fired by him; this implies that Rancid is satisfied with Brutus' work and simply enjoys terrorizing him. Even in their home lives, nothing changes (such as when Brutus wants to borrow the lawnmower and Veeblefester tells him not to take it out of the yard). Deserves to be dragged out into the street and shot, by way of his sadistic nature. His wife's name is \\"Lividea\\", a play on the word \\"livid\\"; presumably she is as unpleasant as her husband. The character's name is a variation on veeblefetzer, a word popularized in the 1950s by Harvey Kurtzman in early issues of Mad. Ramona Gargle ‚Äì Gladys's mother. A stereotypical mother in law, she often visits to pepper Brutus with insults and emotional anguish and criticizes Brutus over his weight. However, Brutus does occasionally gets his own jibes back at \\"Mother Gargle\\". Hurricane Hattie O'Hara ‚Äì The mischievous girl next door, she delights in menacing pretty much any adult she encounters, namely Brutus and her teacher. Other characters regularly featured are the Thornapple family dog, Kewpie; Miss Fungus, Wilberforce and Hattie's school teacher; and Wastrel P. Gravesite, a bum who regularly hounds Brutus for money. Kewpie the Dog- Voice of reason, basically the Thornapple version of Garfield. Uncle Ted- The Uncle of Brutus who often visits Brutus and hangs out with him at dinner and watches TV with him. Elmer Twit- Elmer Twit is Brutus cousin who passed away and sent Brutus a letter.https://www.pinterest.com/pin/194851121366030657/ References * The Born Loser's Guide to Life, 1990.

Another variation is the inner struggle in characters (and by extension, humans in reality) between good and evil. Classical tragedy The form of tragedy described as best by Aristotle and exemplified by Oedipus Rex is, properly, concerned more with the tragic operations of fate than with a thematized conflict between good and evil. Nevertheless, the conflict between the good and the flawed aspects of the tragic hero form an important part of tragic catharsis in Aristotle's theory. There is, moreover, the form of tragedy with a happy ending that, although denigrated from Aristotle, was quite common in antiquity. This form, perhaps best exemplified by the Alcestis of Euripides, ends with a hero or god decisively beating an evil character. Northrop Frye has suggested that this form of \\"tragedy\\" is, in fact, the basic template for melodrama.

Sometimes referred to as \\"The Good War,\\" the Second World War has arguably come in western discourse to signify the very idea of a just war between Good (The Allies) and Evil (The Axis), in both popular and at times even academic spheres. Jewish and Christian literature Writers from the earliest times have thematized the conflict between good and evil, understood, of course, in religious terms. In the Old Testament, Yahweh asks the prophet Jeremiah: \\"The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse‚Äîwho can understand it?\\" (, NRSV). Compare also the Book of Job. In addition to explicating classical myth and stories to reveal a hidden conflict between good and evil in them, they wrote into their own texts different versions of the conflict. The basic forms may be described as the apocalyptic, in which the writer describes real, social events (whether historical or imagined) as manifestations of the eternal conflict between God and Satan, good and evil -- a struggle that, if controlled in the end by God's omnipotence, was nevertheless of deep importance for humans. In a different way, Christian writers could focus on the internal struggle to find or maintain belief. This literature is exemplified by the Psychomachia of Prudentius, whose title continues to signify great psychological turmoil, and supremely by Augustine of Hippo's Confessions, the model for countless later psychological biographies. Special mention might also be made of the Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, a work that combines Platonic, Christian, and Stoic thought on the nature of suffering.  The inner evil conflict  Joseph Conrad defined all humans as having an \\"inner evil\\" or Heart of Darkness in his novella of the same name. While certainly not as widely seen as the direct good vs. evil conflict, the concept of \\"individual vs. self\\" is often much more compelling to a reader/watcher, especially if it is the protagonist. In both literature and film, it requires well-written character development in order to truly succeed. Joseph Conrad's version of the inner evil conflict, known as the Heart of Darkness, is a human's struggle with their own morals, and their own battle with their hidden evil. Although first chiefly used in the novel, this improved device was commonly used, as opposed to the old devices used in literature before the turn of the century. It is a conflict that exists outside of literature as well, making it a universal truth of the human condition.

He is a leader in applying mathematical approaches to biology. He is the John Franklin Enders University Professor at Harvard University.  Education and early life  Kirschner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 28, 1945. He graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in chemistry in 1966. In 1971, he received his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley.https://kirschner.hms.harvard.edu/people/marc-kirschner Career and research He held postdoctoral positions at UC Berkeley and at the University of Oxford in England. He became assistant professor at Princeton University in 1972. In 1978 he was made professor at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1993, he moved to Harvard Medical School, where he served as the chair of the new Department of Cell Biology for a decade.

In his eclectic lab, developmental work on the frog coexists with biochemical work on mechanism of ubiquitination, cytoskeleton assembly or signal transduction. At Princeton, his early work on microtubules established their unusual molecular assembly from tubulin proteins and identified the first microtubule-stabilizing protein tau, later shown to be a major component of the neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. In studies at UC San Francisco of the frog embryo as a model system of cell development, Kirschner identified the first inducer of embryonic differentiation, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), an early finding in the field of signal transduction. Kirschner's lab is also known for uncovering basic mechanisms of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells. Working in Xenopus (frog) egg extracts, Kirschner and Andrew Murray showed that cyclin synthesis drives the cell cycle Pulverer, Bernd \\"Milestones in cell division (12): Surfing the cyclin wave\\" Nature Publishing Group (retrieved 16 May 2012) and, later, that ubiquitin regulates levels of cyclin by marking the cell-cycle molecule for destruction.Brooksbank, Cath \\"Milestones in cell division (20): Disappearing Act\\" Nature Publishing Group (retrieved 16 May 2012) His lab discovered and purified many of the components involved in cell cycle progression, including anaphase promoting complex (APC), the complex that ubiquitinates cyclin B. A second notedLewin, B \\"Great experiments: Dynamic instability of microtubules - Marc Kirschner and Tim Mitchison\\", CELLS! The web site accompanying the Cells textbook (Jones and Bartlett Publishers (2007) finding was his discovery, with Tim Mitchison, of the dynamic instability of microtubules, In mitosis, for example, microtubules form the spindle that separates the chromosomes. The first step in spindle formation is the nucleation of microtubules by microtubule-organizing centers, which then grow in all directions. Microtubules that attach to a chromosome are stabilized and are therefore retained to form part of the spindle. Because of dynamic instability, some individual microtubules that are not stabilized are at risk of collapse (or ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù as Kirschner named it), allowing re-use of the tubulin monomers. This recognition of self-organization in biological systems has been highly influential, and helped shape the view of the cytoplasm as a collection of dynamic molecular machines. Kirschner is also interested in the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate body plan. Together with John Gerhart, he was instrumental in developing the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii into a model system that could be used to study the divergence between hemichordates and chordates, and the evolution of the chordate nervous system. Kirschner is a pioneer in using mathematical approaches to learn about central biological questions. For example, a model of the Wnt pathway he developed in collaboration with the late Reinhart Heinrich showed that new properties and constraints emerge when the individual biochemical steps are combined into a complete pathway. A talk he gave on mathematics and the future of medicine at a retreat for Department Chairs at Harvard Medical School in 2003 inspired the Dean, Joseph B. Martin, to found a new Department, the Department of Systems Biology, with Kirschner as founding chair. Since then, Kirschner's lab has attracted many students and post-docs from theoretical backgrounds who wish to make the transition into biology. His lab is now a leader in using mathematical tools to analyze signaling pathways, cell size control, and the selectivity of drugs. In two books co-authored with John Gerhart, Kirschner has described the cellular and developmental underpinnings of the evolution of organisms, and the concept of \\"evolvability\\". In the most recent book, Kirschner and Gerhart proposed a new theory of \\"facilitated variation\\" that aims to answer the question: How can small, random genetic changes be converted into useful changes in complex body parts? = Public service = Kirschner has been an advocate for federal biomedical research funding and served as first chair of the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy, a coalition of scientific societies he helped create in 1993 to educate the U.S. Congress on biomedical research and lobby for public funding of it.Speech for the American Society for Microbiology National Meeting by Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, New Orleans, 11 December 1993 (retrieved 16 May 2012).

The character has been depicted as an Australian mutant with the ability to teleport objects and people from one location to another. He is considered an unofficial member of the X-Men. Publication history Gateway first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #229 (May 1988), and was created by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri. Fictional character biography Much of Gateway's past remains a mystery to this day, including where exactly he was born and even his name. He is an Aboriginal man who appears to have grown up in the Outback. He serves the criminal group the Reavers in repayment for an undisclosed favor they did him. As extra assurance of his loyalty, they threaten to destroy an Aboriginal holy place if he betrays them. They call him \\"Gateway\\" in reference to his ability to create gateways between two points in space. Some time later, the X-Men appear in the Outback and attack the Reavers' headquarters. Though Gateway helps the Reavers Skullbuster, Bonebreaker, and Pretty Boy escape, the X-Men realize he is not a Reaver.Uncanny X-Men #229 The X-Men take up residence in the Reavers' former hideout, and Gateway begins voluntarily using his powers to assist them. Initially, since he seems unable or unwilling to speak, Psylocke uses her telepathic powers to communicate to Gateway where the X-Men wish to go.Uncanny X-Men #230 However, they soon realize he always knows their desired destination without being told.Uncanny X-Men #231 He also used the Dreamtime to observe the growing corruption of the X-Men‚Äôs ally, Madelyne Pryor, by Limbo demons, yet did neither intervene nor alert any of the X-Men to the growing danger in their backyard just because that was not his purpose in the scheme of things.Uncanny X-Men #234 When Gateway teleported the female X-Men to the Hollywood Mall in Los Angeles, their unusual arrival was noticed by Jubilee, an orphaned teenage mallrat, who happened to be a mutant herself. Admiring the four beautiful ladies, Jubilee secretly followed them the entire day and was eventually rescued by them from a bunch of mutant hunters.Uncanny X-Men #244 When Gateway transported the X-women back to Australia, he deliberately left his portal open longer than necessary. Jubilee saw this and jumped through after them, finding herself welcomed by Gateway.Uncanny X-Men Annual #13 He then pointed her to a secret hide-out underneath the Reavers‚Äô base and for some time Jubilee lived right under the X-Men‚Äôs noses without them noticing.Uncanny X-Men #247 Shortly thereafter, the Reavers ‚Äì now led by Donald Pierce ‚Äì returned to reclaim their base. They made their move when the X-Men were away on a mission, but Gateway managed to contact Psylocke nonetheless. Through the Dreamtime, Gateway sent the telepathic X-Man a precognitive vision, alerting her of the cruel fate the Reavers had in store for them.Uncanny X-Men #250 Psylocke took the warning seriously and, by the time Gateway teleported the X-Men back to the Outback, she convinced the other X-Men to step through the Siege Perilous, a magical crystal portal that was to send them to a new life.Uncanny X-Men #251 Though robbed of their revenge, the Reavers still captured the unsuspecting Wolverine when he returned from a short leave of absence a few days later. They tortured him for days, with Gateway unable to help him, as he was once again forced to obey the Reavers. However, Wolverine managed to escape with the help of Jubilee, revealing in the process that he deliberately arranged for Jubilee to be around for this very purpose.Uncanny X-Men #252 More recently, he appears at the Xavier Institute in Massachusetts, where Generation X is training, with a young girl. When he encounters Banshee, he simply speaks the word, \\"Penance\\", which is assumed to be the girl's name.Generation X #1 Gateway would continue to appear sporadically around Generation X for some time, often in the presence of the fused St. Croix twins Nicole and Claudette, with whom he apparently had a teacher-student relationship.Generation X #1-2, 5, 7 Gateway appears briefly to Storm's X-Treme X-Men team, shortly after the death of Psylocke, and reveals that he is the ancestor of Bishop and Shard.X-Treme X-Men #4 He is one of the mutants to have retained his powers after the M-Day.X-Men: The 198 Files It is revealed to Iceman and Cannonball that Gateway was one of the targeted mutantsX-Men #202 the Marauders were killing, along with Cable, Vargas and The Witness due to his powers giving him the ability to see into the future. The Marauders are later seen reporting to Mister Sinister to have killed Gateway, the Witness and Vargas.X-Men #200 Gateway survives the assassination attempt and becomes the teacher of Eden Fesi, a young man with the power to manipulate reality.Secret Warriors #4 In Uncanny X-Force #27, Fantomex is murdered by Skinless Man and this severs the connection between him and Ultimaton, the guardian Weapon XV who watched over The World and helped raise Evan. Ultimaton returns to his basic sentinel programming to kill all mutants and snaps Gateway's neck before exploding into a nuclear inferno, destroying Cavern X. Psylocke is able to use her telepathic powers to allow Gateway to create one last portal before dying and save the X-Force. Gateway is seen as one of the many resurrected mutants now residing on the island nation of Krakoa. Powers and abilities Gateway is a mutant with teleportation and psychic abilities. Gateway creates wormholes which allow travel through space, time and dimensions. He opens these gateways by whirling his bullroarer over his head. The gateways can be used for both observation and transport. No limits have been shown to Gateway's teleportational range or the mass he can transport. He has, for example, transported the X-Men from Australia to the United States and back using his powers, as well as transporting them trans-dimensionally to another Earth. He also opened up gateways to the past.Wolverine, vol. 2, #104Wolverine, vol. 2, #35 Gateway is additionally able to enter people's dreams.

It forms part of a standard weather station and holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dewcell, a barometer, and a thermograph. Stevenson screens may also be known as a cotton region shelter, an instrument shelter, a thermometer shelter, a thermoscreen, or a thermometer screen. Its purpose is to provide a standardised environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dewpoint, and atmospheric pressure. It is white in color to reflect direct solar radiation. The common type of Stevenson screen has a maximum and minimum thermometer for daily readings. History American variant (Cotton Region shelter) It was designed by Thomas Stevenson (1818‚Äì1887), a Scottish civil engineer who designed many lighthouses, and was the father of author Robert Louis Stevenson. The development of his small thermometer screen with double-louvered walls on all sides and no floor was reported in 1864. After comparisons with other screens in the United Kingdom, Stevenson's original design was modified.A History of the Thermometer and Its Uses in Meteorology, W.E. Knowles Middleton, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1966 The modifications by Edward Mawley of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1884 included a double roof, a floor with slanted boards, and a modification of the double louvers. This design was adopted by the British Meteorological Office and eventually other national services, such as Canada. The national services developed their own variations, such as the single-louvered Cotton Region design in the United States.The Effect of Thermometer Screen Design on the Observed Temperature, W.R. Sparks, WMO-315, World Meteorological Society, Geneva, 1972 Composition The traditional Stevenson screen is a box shape, constructed of wood, in a double-louvered design. However, it is possible to construct a screen using other materials and shapes, such as a pyramid. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) agreed standard for the height of the thermometers is between and above the ground. Size Interior of a Stevenson screen The interior size of the screen will depend on the number of instruments that are to be used. A single screen may measure and a double screen . The unit is either supported by four metal or wooden legs or a wooden post. The top of the screen was originally composed of two asbestos boards with an air space between them. These asbestos boards have generally been replaced by a laminate for health and safety reasons. The whole screen is painted with several coats of white to reflect sunlight radiation, and usually requires repainting every two years. Siting The siting of the screen is very important to avoid data degradation by the effects of ground cover, buildings and trees: WMO 2010 recommendations, if incomplete, are a sound basis. World Meteorological Organization Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation, Fifteenth session, (CIMO-XV, 2010) WMO publication Number 1064 In addition, Environment Canada, for example, recommends that the screen be placed at least twice the distance of the height of the object, e.g., from any tree that is high. In the northern hemisphere, the door of the screen should always face north so as to prevent direct sunlight on the thermometers. In polar regions with twenty-four-hour sunlight, the observer must take care to shield the thermometers from the sun and at the same time avoiding a rise in temperature being caused by the observer's body heat. A special type of Stevenson screen with an eye bolt on the roof is used on a ship. The unit is hung from above and remains vertical despite the movement of the vessel. Future In some areas the use of single-unit automatic weather stations is supplanting the Stevenson screen and other standalone meteorological equipment.

The village is centred on the point where the R125 and R155 regional roads meet. The Broad Meadow River () flows through the village. As of the 2016 census, there were 9,533 people living in Ratoath. Name Ratoath gives its name to a village, a townland, a parish, an electoral division and to a barony. The derivation or meaning of the word is uncertain. Two alternative Irish forms are cited: R√°th-T√≥gh and R√°th-T√°bhachta. These place names occur in Irish manuscripts and scholars say that the writers were referring to Ratoath. Evidently they were trying to give a phonetic rendering of a name that was unfamiliar to them. Mruigtuaithe occurs in the Book of Armagh as the name of one of these places in Meath where Saint Patrick founded a church and Eoin MacNeill identifies it as Ratoath. If this is correct it would seem that the second portion of the word comes from the Irish word tuath which means a territory belonging to a family or sept. Mruig means a grazing plain. R√°th is the Irish for a ringfort. In a royal grant of the manor of Ratoath to Sir Robert Bold in 1468 it was described as Rathonth. Amenities Ratoath has its own secondary school known as Ratoath College. Ratoath has a number pubs, shops, restaurants, and takeaways offering Italian, Chinese, Thai and Indian Cuisine. Population and demographics In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Ratoath increased nearly 10-fold, from 1,061 in 1996 to 9,533 by 2016. According to the 2016 census report, 87% of the town's houses (2,437 of 2,790 households) were constructed between 1991 and 2010. Ratoath is a commuter town with most of its adult population commuting to Dublin to work. More than three quarters of the population travel to work by car. In 2011, 10.9% of the workforce was unemployed compared to the national average of 19%. As of 2011, social class A, employers and managers constituted 717 of the 2,751 households. In April 2011 Ratoath had a population of 9,043, consisting of 4,520 males and 4,523 females. The population of pre-school age (0‚Äì4) was 1,158, of primary school going age (5‚Äì12) was 1,582 and of secondary school going age (13‚Äì18) was 724. There were 313 persons aged 65 years and over. The number of persons aged 18 years or over was 5,677. Non-Irish nationals accounted for 9.7 per cent of the population of Ratoath in 2011 compared with a national average figure of 12.0 per cent. UK nationals (168 persons) were the largest group, followed by Lithuanians (120 persons). 3,676 persons could speak the Irish language and of these 1,702 spoke the language daily. 1,025 persons spoke a language other than Irish or English at home and of these 137 could not speak English well or at all. French was the most common foreign language spoken at home with 131 speakers. There were 7,843 Roman Catholics in the area at census time. A further 649 were adherents of other stated religions, while 420 persons indicated that they had no religion. Sport Sean Eiffe Park the Ratoath GAA grounds Just outside the town is the horse racing track Fairyhouse racecourse, where the Irish Grand National is held. Ratoath has a long history with horse racing, with many jockeys coming from the area. These include Keith Flood, the founder of Fairyhouse racecourse, and holder of the record for the most Grade 1 wins in Ireland and the UK. In 2016, for the first time in their history, Ratoath GAA hurlers got into a Leinster final after they defeated Rosenallis.

Some authors allow any real n, whereas others require that n not be 0 or 1. It is named after Jacob Bernoulli, who discussed it in 1695. Bernoulli equations are special because they are nonlinear differential equations with known exact solutions. A famous special case of the Bernoulli equation is the logistic differential equation. Transformation to a linear differential equation When n = 0, the differential equation is linear. When n = 1, it is separable. In these cases, standard techniques for solving equations of those forms can be applied. For n eq 0 and n eq 1, the substitution u = y^{1-n} reduces any Bernoulli equation to a linear differential equation. For example, in the case n = 2, making the substitution u=y^{-1} in the differential equation \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\\\frac{1}{x}y=xy^2 produces the equation \\\\frac{du}{dx} -\\\\frac{1}{x}u=-x, which is a linear differential equation.

Then we have that y(x) := [z(x)]^{\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha}} is a solution of :y'(x)= P(x)y(x) + Q(x)y^\\\\alpha(x)\\\\ ,\\\\ y(x_0) = y_0 := [z(x_0)]^{\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha}}. And for every such differential equation, for all \\\\alpha>0 we have y\\\\equiv 0 as solution for y_0=0. Example Consider the Bernoulli equation :y' - \\\\frac{2y}{x} = -x^2y^2 (in this case, more specifically Riccati's equation). The constant function y=0 is a solution. Division by y^2 yields :y'y^{-2} - \\\\frac{2}{x}y^{-1} = -x^2 Changing variables gives the equations :u = \\\\frac{1}{y} :u' = \\\\frac{-y'}{y^2}. :-u' - \\\\frac{2}{x}u = - x^2 :u' + \\\\frac{2}{x}u = x^2 which can be solved using the integrating factor :M(x)= e^{2\\\\int \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\,dx} = e^{2\\\\ln x} = x^2. Multiplying by M(x), :u'x^2 + 2xu = x^4,\\\\, The left side can be represented as the derivative of ux^2. Applying the chain rule and integrating both sides with respect to x results in the equations :\\\\int (ux^2)'\\\\,dx = \\\\int x^4\\\\,dx :ux^2 = \\\\frac{1}{5}x^5 + C :\\\\frac{1}{y}x^2 = \\\\frac{1}{5}x^5 + C The solution for y is :y = \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\frac{1}{5}x^5 + C}.

The band consists of Craig Finn (vocals, guitar), Tad Kubler (guitar), Galen Polivka (bass), Bobby Drake (drums), Franz Nicolay (keyboards) and Steve Selvidge (guitar). Noted for their \\"lyrically dense storytelling,\\" and classic rock influences, the band's narrative-based songs frequently address themes such as drug addiction, religion and redemption, and often feature recurring characters based within the city of Minneapolis. Formed four years following the break-up of Finn and Kubler's former band, Lifter Puller, The Hold Steady released the debut album Almost Killed Me in 2004. They came to prominence with the release of their third studio album, Boys and Girls in America, in 2006. In 2010, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Franz Nicolay left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, Heaven Is Whenever (2010). During the band's subsequent tour, the band became a five piece, once more, with the addition of guitarist Steve Selvidge. The band released their sixth LP, Teeth Dreams, on March 25, 2014. Nicolay re-joined the band on May 4, 2016, and the band has since embarked on several concert residencies in the US and the UK. To coincide with each new event, The Hold Steady releases stand-alone singles, marking the first recorded material of the six-piece line-up. The band's seventh LP, Thrashing Thru the Passion, was released in August 2019. History In 2003, Minnesota-raised singer, writer, and guitarist Craig Finn and New York City bartender and bassist Galen Polivka began talking about starting a band. Finn and lead guitarist Tad Kubler (both formerly of Lifter Puller) developed the idea of The Hold Steady when, while watching The Band concert film The Last Waltz, Finn asked Kubler, \\"Dude, why aren't there any bands like this anymore?\\" The Hold Steady's 2004 debut album Almost Killed Me, released on Frenchkiss Records, was a sleeper hit among music critics, reaching No. 31 in the Pazz & Jop critics poll that year, an achievement which Finn described as \\"like being nominated for an Oscar or something.\\" In May 2005, they were the first rock band to grace the front page of The Village Voice in 15 years . They were Blender's 2006 \\"Band of the Year\\". The band released its second album, Separation Sunday, on May 3, 2005. The album was a loose concept album following the exploits of a character named \\"Holly\\" (short for \\"Hallelujah\\") and her quest to find a balance between Catholicism and rock and roll through drugs and a metaphorical resurrection. The album was critically lauded, and its religious overtones were picked up by many critics, such as Joe Gross of the Village Voice, who dubbed it \\"the most egregiously American Catholic album since X's Under the Big Black Sun, Springsteen's Tunnel of Love, or that Jewish new waver Billy Joel's The Stranger.\\" =Boys and Girls in America (2006‚Äì2007)= After Separation Sunday, the band moved from the Frenchkiss Records imprint to Vagrant Records. Released October 3, 2006, Boys and Girls in America was ranked No. 8 on the Rolling Stone Best Albums of 2006 list, and first by The A.V. Club. Pitchfork Media's Scott Plagenhoff wrote of the album, \\"[Craig Finn] not only has a commanding, rousing voice but he also says something worth hearing, displaying gifts for both scope and depth that are all too rare in contemporary rock ‚Äî indie or mainstream.\\" In 2006, they released a music video for \\"Chips Ahoy\\", directed by Moh Azima and starring Avital Ash. In 2007, the band recorded a modified version of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\" to be played during the seventh-inning stretch at Minnesota Twins home games. They also contributed a cover of the Bob Dylan and The Hawks/The Band song Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window? to the motion picture I'm Not There. =Stay Positive (2008‚Äì2009)= The band's fourth album, Stay Positive, was released in the UK on July 14, 2008 and in the U.S. on July 15. The album was recorded in Hoboken, New Jersey and Wild Arctic studio in Queens, New York with producer John Agnello during January and February that year. Guests on the sessions included Ben Nichols from Lucero, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Emilyn Brodsky, and Doug Gillard, who played guitar in Guided By Voices. Finn has said that he believes the album \\"captures a band hitting their creative peak, as well as enjoying each other's creativity and company.\\" The album is more expansive than previous releases, including talk-box solos, harpsichord, and tuneful vocals (the notoriously gruff-voiced Finn started taking voice lessons). \\"There are some bands that do five records that all sound similar,\\" says guitarist Tad Kubler. \\"We've tried to avoid that.\\" Many familiar elements ‚Äì sing-along choruses, extended piano and guitar solos and lyrics that deal with faith, crime, rumor, loss and love ‚Äì remain. In April 2009, the band released a two-disc documentary and live album set entitled A Positive Rage. =Nicolay's departure, Heaven Is Whenever and the addition of Selvidge (2010‚Äì2011)= On January 20, 2010, Franz Nicolay confirmed on his official website that he had left the band. Regarding his departure, vocalist and guitarist Craig Finn stated: \\"Franz is a real ambitious guy, and I think he wanted to do a lot of different things, and we want to really follow this one Hold Steady thing to its logical end. And it takes up a lot of time. It was an amicable departure, and I think we all wish him the best. He‚Äôll do a lot of interesting, cool things.\\" Nicolay had said that he considered his work with the Hold Steady to be completed, saying \\"I‚Äôm proud of the work we did together. In the end, I felt I completed the work I needed to do with them. I‚Äôd prefer to think of it as a closed book.\\" The Hold Steady announced the release of Heaven Is Whenever on Feb. 23, 2010. The album was released May 4 on Vagrant Records in the U.S. and May 3 on Rough Trade in Europe. The band's subsequent tour featured additional musicians Steve Selvidge, formerly of Big Ass Truck and Lucero, on guitar and Dan Neustadt, of In Cadeo and The World/Inferno Friendship Society. Neustadt had previously played keyboards on Heaven is Whenever, but eventually left the touring band by 2011. In 2011, Selvidge was added to the band's official line-up, with Craig Finn stating, \\"We added [Steve Selvidge], we are a five piece. We are rolling without keys right now. We did some shows without keys and we really liked it. It sort of opened things up for us. We have two pretty amazing guitar players in our band, and it's really fun to have that space and spread out. They can sort of work against each other/with each other. Steve's been a great addition to the band. We came across Steve many years ago and we always kind of said, 'Man, if things open up and we can get him in the band, we want him.' [...] Steve, lives in Memphis. So wherever we record this time, someone's not going to be at home.\\" In July 2011, during a five-month break from the band, Craig Finn recorded a solo album, entitled Clear Heart Full Eyes, which was subsequently released in January 2012. =Hiatus (2012‚Äì2013)= The band recorded a track for the Game of Thrones episode \\"Walk of Punishment\\", entitled \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\", and released it, alongside a new track, \\"Criminal Fingers\\", for Record Store Day 2013. Regarding the release, guitarist Tad Kubler stated, \\"Steve [Selvidge] ‚Äì our guitar player wasn‚Äôt in the band when we did the last record so we haven‚Äôt formally released anything that he‚Äôs played on ‚Äì other than an iTunes session or something like that. Having been away for a few years, we thought this would be a great opportunity to reintroduce the newest version of the band.\\" =Teeth Dreams (2014-2015)= On January 8, 2014, The Hold Steady announced the release of their sixth LP entitled Teeth Dreams. The album was released on March 25 via Washington Square, a new imprint of record label Razor & Tie. In addition, the band announced the release of a covers EP entitled RAGS, whose proceeds go towards the K + L Guardian Foundation to benefit the children of deceased super fan Mike \\"Jersey Mike\\" Van Jura. =Nicolay's return, concert residencies, and Thrashing Thru the Passion (2016‚Äìpresent)= In 2016, Nicolay rejoined the band, expanding its lineup to a six-piece. The band soon began performing three-night residencies in specific cities, as opposed to embarking on full tours. In 2016, they performed residencies in Chicago and Brooklyn, and returned to both the following year for the named events, Chicago Seemed Wired Last Night and Massive Nights, before performing over three nights in London for Boys & Girls in London in 2018. In late 2017, to coincide with the band's 2017 Massive Nights residency, the band released two new songs, \\"Entitlement Crew\\" and \\"Snake in the Shower\\", with two further tracks, \\"Eureka\\" and \\"Esther\\", from the same recording sessions accompanying Boys & Girls in London. The recordings are the first to feature the full six-person Hold Steady line-up. On March 4, 2019 the band released their first song of 2019; The Last Time She Talked To Me. On June 18, 2019 the band announced their seventh album, Thrashing Thru the Passion. The album was released on August 16, 2019 via Frenchkiss Records. Influences In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Craig Finn outlined the band's influences: Reception The Hold Steady have received almost universal praise by the press for their performances and early records. Their more recent releases have seen a slight decline in their reception. The Hold Steady appeared in the Season 3 Finale episode of Showtime's Billions series as themselves performing at a party for Axe Capital. The Hold Steady's star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First AvenueThe Hold Steady has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Kubler and Finn's previous group Lifter Puller also has a star.

An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the data logger, rechargeable battery, telemetry (optional) and the meteorological sensors with an attached solar panel or wind turbine and mounted upon a mast. The specific configuration may vary due to the purpose of the system. The system may report in near real time via the Argos System and the Global Telecommunications System, or save the data for later recovery. In the past, automatic weather stations were often placed where electricity and communication lines were available. Nowadays, the solar panel, wind turbine and mobile phone technology have made it possible to have wireless stations that are not connected to the electrical grid or hardline telecommunications network. Sensors RWIS station Most automatic weather stations have * Thermometer for measuring temperature * Anemometer for measuring wind speed * Wind vane for measuring wind direction * Hygrometer for measuring humidity * Barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure Some stations can also have * Ceilometer for measuring cloud height * Present weather sensor and/or visibility sensor * Rain gauge for measuring liquid-equivalent precipitation * Ultrasonic snow depth sensor for measuring depth of snow * Pyranometer for measuring solar radiation Unlike manual weather stations, automated airport weather stations cannot report the class and amount of clouds. Also, precipitation measurements are difficult, especially for snow, as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as fog patches, remain unobserved. The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non- climatic change in the climate record.Begert, M., Schlegel, T., and Kirchhofer, W.: Homogeneous temperature and precipitation series of Switzerland from 1864 to 2000. Int. J. Climatol., 25, 65‚Äì80, 2005. The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location can lead to a jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by homogenization. Data-logger Data-logger for automatic weather station The data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station. In high quality weather stations, the data-logger may be designed by the supplier to be the perfect solution for a particular meteorological client. Indeed, usually data-loggers found in the market don't fit the requirement in terms of power consumption, inputs, communication, protection against animals (ants, rats, etc.), humidity, salty air, sand, etc. The main functions of a data-logger are: * Measurement: the data-logger collects the information from every sensor and archives it. * Calculation: the data-logger processes most of the meteorological data for the users (avg, min, max...). * Data storage: the data-logger saves all the data either on its own memory or on uSD memory card. * Power supply: the data-logger manages the power supply of the Automatic Weather Station, using a solar panel for instance. * Communication: the data-logger manages the communication protocols with the remote server. The different communication protocols are usually GSM, GPRS, RTC, WiFi, uSD, and RS232. Enclosures Enclosure with solar panel for data-logger of weather station Enclosures used with automatic weather stations are typically weather proof fiberglass, ABS or stainless steel, With ABS being the cheapest, cast aluminium paint or stainless steel the most durable and fiberglass being a compromise. AWS Power supply The main power source for an automatic weather station depends on its usage. Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels connected in parallel with a regulator and one or more rechargeable batteries. As a rule of thumb, solar output is at its optimum for only 5 hours each day. As such, mounting angle and position are vital. In the Northern Hemisphere, the solar panel would be mounted facing south and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere. The output from the solar panels may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid. Most automated airport weather stations are connected to the commercial power grid due to the higher power needs of the ceilometer and present weather sensors, which are active sensors and emit energy directly into the environment. Mast The standard mast heights used with automatic weather stations are 2, 3, 10 and 30 meters. Other sizes are available, but typically these sizes have been used as standards for differing applications. *The 2 meter (6.6 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect a human subject. The mast height is referenced to head height. *The 3 meter (9.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect crops (such as wheat, sugar cane etc.) The mast height is referenced to crop top. *The 10 meter (32.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters without interference from objects such as trees, buildings or other obstructions. Typically the most important weather parameter measured at this height is wind speed and direction. *The 30 meter (98.4 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters over stratified distances for the purposes of data modelling. A common application is to take measurements of wind, humidity and temperature at 30, 10, and 2 meters. Other sensors are mounted around the 2 meter or lower height.

Overview  The bill was introduced and published on 25 November 2004 and received Royal Assent on 7 April 2005. The act implemented the institutional changes published in the Department for Transport's White Paper on rail of 15 July 2004, principally: * Abolished the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), transferring some of its functions to the Secretary of State, some (consumer protection ones) to the Office of Rail Regulation, and some to the devolved administrations. * Reduced the financial jurisdiction of the Office of Rail Regulation, imposing a Treasury-determined cap on its financial powers and requiring the Secretary of State for Transport to specify what he wants in return for the public subsidy which goes into the railway industry. * Established Passenger Focus as a single national consumer representation body, replacing the geographically separated Rail Passengers Council. * Set up a new regime for the closure of railway facilities and services. Government defeat During the final Parliamentary stages of the passage of the Railways Act 2005, the Government sustained a defeat in the House of Lords over an amendment which would have protected passenger and train operators against a diminution of infrastructure quality or performance - or being held rigidly to their contracts for the provision of railway services which assumed no such diminution - if the Secretary of State for Transport restricted funds available to Network Rail. However, the amendment was reversed the same day in the House of Commons with a much weaker provision substituted for it. The House of Lords did not insist on their original amendment, and the legislation was passed without the protections which the train operators needed. Critics regarded this as an unjustified interference in an inter-dependent contractual matrix, contrary to the legitimate expectations of private investors in the railway.

The Larne gun-running was a major gun smuggling operation organised in April 1914 in Ireland by Major Frederick H. Crawford and Captain Wilfrid Spender for the Ulster Unionist Council to equip the Ulster Volunteer Force. The operation involved the smuggling of almost 25,000 rifles and between 3 and 5 million rounds of ammunition from the German Empire, with the shipments landing in Larne, Donaghadee, and Bangor in the early hours between Friday 24 and Saturday 25 April 1914. The Larne gun-running may have been the first time in history that motor-vehicles were used \\"on a large scale for a military- purpose, and with striking success\\".  Background to the gun-running  In November 1910 the Ulster Unionist Council formed a secret committee to oversee the creation of a force in Ulster to fight against the imposition of Home Rule, which was proposed to give Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Council approached Major Frederick H. Crawford to act as its agent to purchase the guns needed to equip such an organisation. Crawford wrote to five arms manufacturers, including the Austrian Steyr and the German Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, seeking quotations for the purchase of 20,000 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition. In January 1913, the Ulster Unionist Council instituted the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), consisting of men who had signed the Ulster Covenant. They wanted to co-ordinate the paramilitary activities of Ulster‚Äôs unionists, as well as to give military backing to the threats of the Ulster Covenant to resist implementation of the Third Home Rule Bill, which had been introduced on 11 April 1912 by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. These threats had been regarded as a \\"gigantic game of bluff and blackmail\\" by Irish nationalist leader John Redmond as well as most Liberal MPs, including Winston Churchill. UVF membership grew to around 90,000 members, led by retired officers of the British Army, with the organisation under the charge of Lieutenant-General Sir George Richardson KCB, a veteran of the Afghan Wars. By 1913 the UVF had over ¬£1 million pledged to it, and ¬£70,000 invested in attempts to import arms. Throughout 1913 Major Crawford, with the use of aliases and disguises, had attempted to smuggle in arms bought in Great Britain and Imperial Germany, but vigilant customs officials had seized the goods at the docks. In one instance, patrol boats thwarted a gun-running attempt to Carrigart in northern County Donegal carried out by Lord Leitrim. Lord Leitrim had been carrying out a weekly small-scale gun-smuggling operation since February 1913, run by his chauffeur. In early June 1913, around seven thousand rifles being stored by Crawford in a disused inn in Hammersmith were seized by police. The inn was being rented out to Crawford by a brother-in-law of staunch Unionist Sir William Bull, 1st Baronet. One week later, with the intention of forcing the government to accept that there was a real risk of armed resistance to Home Rule in Ulster., Crawford openly transported weapons to Belfast from several locations across England. These were intercepted by customs officials, Major Crawford convinced the Ulster Unionist Council that he could provide the weapons and ammunition needed \\"to equip the entire UVF\\". In February 1914, when Crawford spoke with Edward Carson in London, Carson said \\"I'll see you through this business even if I should go to prison for it. You are the bravest man I have ever met.\\"  Preparations and transport  Major Crawford and arms dealer Benny Spiro, March 1914. The man on the far right of the back row is Richard Toomath, of John Milligan & Co. Coal Merchants. The firm was Crawford's link to the Clydesdale Steamship Company. Crawford secured the services of the SS Fanny to transport 216 tons of guns and ammunition which he had purchased from Benny Spiro, an arms dealer in Hamburg. Included in this cache was; 11,000 Mannlicher rifles brought from the Steyr works in Austria; 9,000 Gewehr 1888s; 4,600 Italian Vetterli-Vitali rifles; and 5 million rounds of ammunition in clips of five ‚Äî much of which was transported from Hamburg via the Kiel Canal. On 30 March 1914, these weapons were being loaded onto the SS Fanny on the Baltic island of Langeland when Danish customs officials seized the papers of the ship. The customs officials suspected that the cargo might contain weapons to arm militant Icelandic home rulers who sought independence from Denmark. The SS Fanny managed to escape into a gale and sailed outside Danish territorial waters. In covering the incident on 1 April, The Times newspaper predicted that the guns were destined for Ulster rather than Iceland. In a bid to evade the authorities as the SS Fanny neared Ireland, Major Crawford purchased the SS Clyde Valley in Glasgow. On 19‚Äì20 April off Tuskar Rock, County Wexford, the entire cache of weapons was transferred from the SS Fanny onto the SS Clyde Valley. On 24 April, the SS Clyde Valley was renamed the \\"Mountjoy II\\", with the use of strips of canvas painted with white letters on a black background. This referred to the Mountjoy that broke the boom across the River Foyle during the Siege of Derry in 1689, providing historic symbolism for unionists. In Ulster, the UVF were given instructions for a full test-mobilisation. The UVF Motor Corps was summoned by the County Antrim commander, General Sir William Adair, and instructed as follows: This was all part of a \\"meticulous\\" and \\"elaborate\\" plan to ensure that the operation succeeded; only 12 people knew the full details and reason for the mobilisation of the UVF members. This was officially only a \\"test mobilisation\\". Captain F. Hall, the military secretary to the UVF recorded details of these plans in a memorandum. These included tapping of the private telephone line connecting Hollywood Barracks to Exchange, as well as the short-circuiting of phone and telegraph wires into Larne after the last train, and the \\"shorting\\" of the main rail lines. On the date of the landings, UVF members manned pickets and patrols along the length of the coast road between Belfast and Larne, as well as the roads leading to the towns of Ballyclare, Ballymena, and Glenarm amongst others. The men at these pickets were to give directions to any who needed them and were provided with reserve supplies of petrol and tools for repairing any vehicle that had problems. In Larne, UVF members wearing armlets stood \\"in line silent as soldiers on parade\\", and manned cordons that blocked the roads, preventing vehicles without a special permit from entering or departing Larne. Captain James Craig took command of the operations in Bangor, with Adair taking command in Larne. Sir George Richardson, overall commander of the UVF, remained in Belfast on the night of the landings and was kept fully informed of proceedings by dispatch-riders.  Hoax and real landings  On the date for the UVF Motor Corps \\"test\\" operation, a decoy ship, the tramp steamer SS Balmerino, was dispatched into Belfast Lough as a decoy to attract attention from authorities, to investigate it for smuggled armaments, in what the UVF leadership called the Hoax. In addition, the UVF arranged for a large truck to be waiting at the Belfast docks as if for an incoming load. The captain of the SS Balmerino ensured that by making his ship's approach as suspicious as possible, the authorities would be alerted. Once the ship was docked, the captain set about stalling the authorities for as long as possible with excuses, and the authorities believed that they had intercepted the real cargo. Eventually the authorities searched the ship's contents, discovering its papers were in order and it was carrying only coal as described. Whilst this was happening, twenty miles away the \\"Mountjoy II\\" brought the real arms cache into Larne harbour unhindered. After the \\"Mountjoy II\\" docked, a motor- boat came alongside and cranes transferred \\"thousands\\" of rifles to it. After it had motored away, a second vessel came up to receive more arms. These vessels transported their loads to Donaghadee. Larne harbour present day There the weapons were transferred to the motor vehicles; each batch was counted and its destination noted by counting clerks. Due to the volume of weapons, temporary arms-dumps had been set up in the surrounding districts so that the vehicles could return as quickly as possible to receive another load. The Belfast Evening Telegraph remarked that all present \\"put their backs into it\\" and that it \\"illustrated the old adage, 'One Volunteer is worth three pressed men'\\" and they \\"toiled like galley slaves\\". The local population of Larne were noted as having lined the streets exchanging salutes and running makeshift canteens to supply the workers with refreshments throughout the night. At 5 am the Mountjoy set sail from Larne harbour for Bangor to unload the rest of its cargo. Three cheers for \\"The King\\" and three more for \\"the Volunteers\\" were let out by the ship's skipper and its crew as they stood to attention, with the cheers reportedly reciprocated by all those ashore. By 8:30 am the \\"Mountjoy II\\" had completed its mission, and it set course for the River Clyde to confuse any coast-guards. On its way, crew cut away the canvas sheets bearing the name Mountjoy II, revealing the ship's real name, and it proceeded south along the Irish Sea. After offloading Major Crawford at Rosslare, County Wexford, the SS Clyde Valley set sail for the Baltic Sea, travelling along the coasts of France and Denmark. It rendezvoused with the SS Fanny to bring back the Ulstermen contingent of its crew. After that was done, the SS Fanny was disposed of at Hamburg.  Aftermath and consequences  Mural in Island Street, East Belfast, 2001, depicting two of those involved in the Larne gun- running; Captain Craig (far-left) and Major Crawford (second from left) One of the key figures in the operation was Captain Wilfrid Spender, a member of the UVF headquarters staff who is alleged to have been responsible for the entire scheme and helped in the Hoax masquerade. His wife recorded details of the landing in her diary for the dates 24‚Äì25 April: The Belfast Evening Telegraph reported on the events on April 25: For the Unionist leaders, the Larne gun- running was even more of a political coup than a military feat. The Ulster Volunteers remained inadequately armed, as the weapons shipment contained three types of weapon and insufficient proper ammunition for them. Other historians consider that the Mauser 1898 model was advanced for its time, and the Larne delivery markedly increased the amount of arms for the UVF. Many much smaller weapons purchases had resulted in the UVF as having just over 37,000 rifles by June 1914.ATQ Stewart The Ulster Crisis (Faber & Faber, London 1967; reprinted 1969; Gregg Revivals 1993; Blackstaff Press 1997); see appendix for numbers and sources. . The Larne gun-running put the gun back into Irish politics. The Irish Volunteers had been working on their own plan to acquire weapons, and the success at Larne heightened nationalist suspicions that the authorities were acquiescent towards unionist militants in Ulster. After the events in Larne, the nationalist Irish Volunteers, formed in late 1913, attracted many new members. At the outbreak of the First World War, the government requested all arms and ammunition of the UVF for the war effort. By 1916 the ammunition had largely been transferred, but none of the rifles. In 1920 after the outbreak of the Irish war of Independence, the rifles were used to arm the new Ulster Special Constabulary that was formed (by the same Wilfrid Spender). The USC was largely recruited from former Ulster Volunteers. In 1940 the rifles were released to arm the British Home Guard after the Battle of France. They were first fired in action during the East African Campaign of 1940-41, arming the militias of Haile Selassie I.ATQ Stewart, op. cit., appendix. The Irish Volunteers arranged their own gun-running operation in July 1914, transporting the guns on a private yacht and unloading in daylight at the harbour, in front of a crowd. The Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP), aided by troops of the 2nd King's Own Scottish Borderers, tried unsuccessfully to confiscate the weapons. On their return to their barracks in Dublin, some troops, baited by a hostile crowd, killed three people and wounded 38. A fourth man died later. Some nationalists interpreted the contrast between the inactivity of the police and military in Larne (which operation took place in the middle of the night) and the heavy-handed response in the middle of the day in Dublin that authorities were biased in favour of the UVF. The whole episode heightened tensions in Ireland, pulling it closer to the brink of civil war.

The kipunji has a unique call, described as a 'honk-bark', which distinguishes it from its close relatives, the grey-cheeked mangabey and the black crested mangabey, whose calls are described as 'whoop-gobbles'. Though it was originally thought to be a member of the Lophocebus genus genetic data later placed it as its own separate genus Rungwecebus. The kipunji is the first new monkey genus to be discovered since Allen's swamp monkey in 1923. The kipunji was independently discovered by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Georgia, and Conservation International, in December 2003 and July 2004, making it the first new African monkey species discovered since the sun-tailed monkey in 1984. Originally assigned to the genus Lophocebus, genetic and morphological tests showed that it is more closely related to the baboons (genus Papio) than to the other mangabeys in the genus Lophocebus, and that Lophocebus was diphyletic, meaning that species with differing genealogies have been mistakenly lumped together. Scientists have assigned it to a new genus, Rungwecebus, named after Mount Rungwe, where it is found. Zoologists were initially skeptical of the existence of the kipunji until its discovery, as traditional tales of the Nyakyusa people described the monkey as both real and mythical. Physical description Adult male kipunjis have been observed at an average length of 85 to 90 cm and are estimated to weigh between 10 and 16 kg. The kipunji's relatively long pelage is light or medium brown with white on the end of the tail and the ventrum. Pelage close to the hands and feet tends to be a medium to dark brown. Hands, feet, and face are all black. These primates do not appear to show any sexual dimorphism in relation to pelage coloration. One feature, in combination with their pelage coloration, that helps to separate kipunjis from their Cercocebus and Lophocebus relativess is the broad crest of hair on the crown of their heads. Distribution Around 1,100 of the animals live in the highland Ndundulu Forest Reserve, a forest adjacent to Udzungwa Mountains National Park, and in a disjunct population 250 miles away on Mount Rungwe and in Kitulo National Park, which is adjacent to it. The forest at Rungwe is highly degraded, and fragmentation of the remaining forest threatens to split that population into three smaller populations. The Ndundulu forest is in better shape, but the population there is smaller. Conservation The kipunji is classified as an endangered species by the IUCN. In 2008, a Wildlife Conservation Society team found that the monkey's range is restricted to just 6.82 mi2 (17.7 km2) of forest in the two isolated regions, the Ndundulu forest and the Rungwe-Livingstone forest. The Ndundulu forest is the smaller of the two and was found to support a population of 75 individuals, ranging from 15 to 25 individuals per group. The Rungwe-Livingstone forest is suspected to contain 1,042 individuals in Rungwe-Kitulo, ranging from 25 to 39 individuals per group. All areas where the kipunji is found are considered protected areas, but no management operations are currently in effect. Several factors contribute to the projected decline of the species, including predation, habitat destruction, and hunting. The kipunji has only two known predators: crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). The biggest threats to the species come from human activities. Logging for timber and charcoal production are the most prominent threats, but locals are also known to hunt the kipunji due to its crop-destroying habits or simply as a food source. Continued habitat loss is anticipated to cause a loss of the Bujingijila Corridor that links two populations in the Mount Rungwe and Livingstone forests. The species was included in the list of \\"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates\\" in 2006 and 2008.

Despite its uncharacteristically mainstream sound the album failed to chart. Production and legacy Having no musical training or instrumental experience, throughout his career Van Vliet had relied on a musical director within the band who could translate his often unorthodox ideas into a form that was musically playable. This role had been successively filled by Alex St. Clair, John French, and Bill Harkleroad on his previous albums. With the entire Magic Band having quit after the recording of his previous album he no longer had such an intermediary. As a result, the album is generally considered the nadir of Van Vliet's musical career. One of the musicians, Micheal Smotherman, said \\"Don was just as confused as he could be throughout the whole process ... I would push his face up to the microphone and he would start singing. And when it was time to stop I would pull him back gently.\\" The album does, however, have its influence: an early White Stripes EP entitled Party of Special Things to Do (2001) contains three Beefheart covers, including this album's opening track. Kate Bush in a Smash Hits interview considered this one of her top ten albums. Mercury Rev covered \\"Observatory Crest\\" for a BBC session in 1999, which was released as B-side on their \\"Little Rhymes\\" single in 2002. John French listened to the album again in 2017, his apparent first listen since the album's release, and exclaimed that Van Vliet sounded almost lost in places, as if he didn't \\"really know exactly where to sing\\" ‚Äì and that \\"it must have been difficult for him to function in that environment\\". According to French, Van Vliet said himself that the only good part about the album was the cover art by his cousin, Victor Hayden.

Unlike many similar yet independent companies, Fiat Group-owned Ferrari continued to thrive after the death of its charismatic founder and is today one of the most successful sports car companies in the world. In January 2016, Ferrari officially split off from its former parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. 1929-1937 - Scuderia Ferrari Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. The Scuderia bought, prepared and fielded racing cars for gentleman drivers. It rapidly became a technical-racing outpost of Alfa Romeo and effectively took over as its official racing department in 1933 when Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team. The Scuderia was then supplied with Alfa Romeo P3 monopostos and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. The Ferrari's monopostos were now sporting the Prancing Horse shield on the engine cover. In 1935 the Ferrari's workshop designed and built its first race car, the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, taking the first steps on the route to become a car manufacturer. Moreover, during 1937 the first examples of Alfetta 158 were assembled in Modena under Enzo Ferrari's supervision. In 1938 Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milano and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department. At the same time the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded. 1939-1946 - Auto Avio Costruzioni On September 6, 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision that he won't use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. A few days later he founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, headquartered in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari in Modena. The new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft parts but in 1940 Ferrari did in fact build two examples of a race car ‚Äì the Auto Avio Costruzioni 815, based on a Fiat 508C platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943 the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. During the war the company's focus was mostly on fabricating grinding machines which were copies of original German tooling machines. The factory was bombed by the Allies between 1944 and 1945, but it was quickly rebuilt. In late 1945, after the war ended, Ferrari commissioned Gioacchino Colombo the design of a new V12 engine. In December 1946 Ferrari released to the press the specifications and drawings of his new car. 1947-1961 - The beginning The first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 125 Sport, powered by a 1.5 L V12 engine. On March 12, Enzo Ferrari took the car out for its first test-drive on the open roads. Two examples debuted on May 11, 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit, driven by Franco Cortese and Nino Farina. This was the first time a Ferrari-badged car was entered in a race. In 1950, Ferrari fielded racing cars in the Monaco Grand Prix, the first World Championship event held there. Jos√© Froil√°n Gonz√°lez won the first Grand Prix for Ferrari in 1951, and Alberto Ascari secured Ferrari's first World title in 1952, a task he would repeat the following season. In 1957 the company changed its name to Auto Costruzioni Ferrari. The same year, the Dino marque was introduced. 1961 - The great walkout Enzo Ferrari's strong personality had served his company and racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, well for decades. Internal tensions reached boiling point in November 1961. Long-time sales manager Girolamo Gardini had long chafed at the involvement of Enzo's wife, Laura, in the company. The two frequently argued, and their dispute became a crisis for the company when Gardini, together with manager Romolo Tavoni, chief engineer Carlo Chiti, experimental sports car development chief Giotto Bizzarrini, made an ultimatum to Ferrari, demanding the removal of his wife from the company in a letter. As a result, Ferrari called a meeting where Gardini, Tavoni, Chiti, Bizzarrini and a number of others who stood by them were ousted. All were tremendous losses to the company, and many thought this might be the end of Ferrari. Indeed, the defectors immediately formed a new company, ATS, to directly compete with Ferrari on the street and the track, and took with them Scuderia Serenissima, one of Ferrari's best racing customers. This \\"great walkout\\" came at an especially difficult time for Ferrari. At the urging of Chiti, the company was developing a new 250-based model to defend its honor against the Jaguar E-Type. Development of this car, the 250 GTO, was at a critical point, with the chassis development and styling left incomplete. Even if the car could be finished, it was unclear if it could be raced successfully without Tavoni and his lieutenants. Into this void stepped young engineer Mauro Forghieri and long-time racing bodyman Sergio Scaglietti. Forghieri successfully honed the GTO's handling and Scaglietti designed an all-new body for the car. The GTO went to Sebring with driver Phil Hill and placed first in class. It continued winning through 1962, brushing aside the challenge from Jaguar and becoming one of the most famous sports cars in history. This shakeup, and Forghieri's engineering talent, made the 1960s even more successful for Ferrari than the previous decade. The mid- engined Dino racers laid the foundation for Forghieri's dominant 250-powered 250 P. On the street, the Dino road cars sold strongly, and legendary models like the 275 and Daytona were on the way. 1963-1967 - The US rivals The big V8-powered Shelby Cobra challenged the Ferraris in the early 1960s. By the mid 1960s, Ford tried to buy Ferrari but no agreement was reached. Instead, the Ford GT40 ended the dominance of Ferrari Prototypes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 when GT-40 Mark IIs finished 1-2-3. Ford dominated Le Mans again in 1967 in the Mark IV. 1968 - Ferrari boycott After the performance of the big V8-powered Ford at the 1967 Le Mans, the FIA banned prototypes over 3000cc, which also affected the 330Ps. The change was announced in late 1967 and came in effect for 1968; for that season, the Scuderia did not take part in sports car racing in protest. 1969-1971 - The challenge with Porsche  These years saw a new challenger. Formerly competing with smaller cars only, the Germans entered the new 3-litre sports car prototype class in 1968 with the Porsche 908, while Ferrari raced the Ferrari 312P in only few events in 1969. In March, the presentation of the 5 litre Porsche 917, built in advance in 25 exemplars, had surprised also Ferrari, which answered later that year with the production of 25 Ferrari 512S, funded from the money gained by the FIAT deal. At that time, Porsche had almost a full season of experience with their new car, and took the World Sportscar Championship where Ferrari was only 4th. The 1970 season saw epic battles between the two teams and the many cars they entered, yet Porsche won every event except Sebring, where the victorious car and its drivers Ignazio Giunti/Nino Vaccarella/Mario Andretti had their origins in Italy. Ferrari decided to give up the 512 in 1971 in order to prepare the new 312PB for the 1972 season, when only 3 litre class would be allowed. In addition to Porsche, the old national rival with its Alfa Romeo T33/3 also had won two races in 1971, and thus was ranked second in the World Championship, above Ferrari. 1969 - Fiat Early in 1969, Fiat S.p.A. took a 50% stake in Ferrari. An immediate result was an increase in available investment funds, and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from Fiat's Turin plant of the Ferrari engined Fiat Dino. New model investment further up in the Ferrari range also received a boost. Less positive was the effect on industrial relations at Ferrari's Maranello plant. In June a visiting journalist witnessed a group of workers suddenly running out of a workshop in response to the blast of a whistle: this was part of an industrial stoppage originating at the main Fiat plant in Turin, and contrasted with the relatively smooth state of production that the writer had witnessed at competitor plants nearby. While increased Fiat influence was quickly felt in the development, production and marketing of road cars, the racing department remained initially little touched by Fiat's new status within the company as chief investor. 1972-1973 - dominance, defeats and fare-well The 312PB dominated the World Sportscar Championship in 1972 against a rival Alfa Romeo, as the Porsche factory did not compete after the rule changes, and Matra focused on Le Mans only. In their home race, the French won, as Ferrari did not enter in 1972 due insufficient reliability over 24 hours, in order not to blemish their otherwise perfect record in that season. In 1973, though, the Matra team also challenged for the championship which Ferrari eventually lost with two wins, compared to Matra's five, while Alfa Romeo had not entered that year. In addition, Ferrari was now forced to race also at Le Mans, despite concerns that even the modified engine would not last. Yet, one car survived and scored an unexpected and honourable 2nd place. Ferrari then retired from Sports car racing to focus on the railing F1 effort. 1974-1987 - Niki Lauda and the 1980s Ferrari enjoyed a successful spell in Formula 1 in the 1970s, with Niki Lauda winning the World Championship in 1975 and 1977, and Jody Scheckter in 1979. In the 1980s, however, the team entered a period of crisis, culminating with the death of Gilles Villeneuve in Belgium in 1982 and a nearly-fatal accident for Didier Pironi in Germany the very same year. 1988 - The death of Enzo Enzo Ferrari died in 1988, at the age of 90. The last new model he commissioned was the specialist F40. Fiat increased its stake in Ferrari to 90% after buying the shares of its founder. Former Sporting Director Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was appointed President in 1991. 1996 - Champion Schumacher to Scuderia Ferrari The hiring of Jean Todt as Sporting director in 1993 and Michael Schumacher in 1996 triggered a comeback of the F1 team, with three wins in 1996, and close yet eventually losing challenges to the driver's championship in the years 1997 to 1999. 2000-2004 - Schumacher Dominates F1 In an unprecedented and record-setting fashion, Schumacher and Ferrari dominated F1 winning the World Driver's championship from 2000 through 2004 and the Constructors' Championship from 1999 through 2004. 2002-2010 - New shareholders In June 2002 Fiat sold 34% of Ferrari to a Mediobanca-led consortium of banks for ‚Ç¨775.2 million. The consortium comprised Commerzbank (who got a 10% stake for ‚Ç¨228 million), Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (1.5%) and Compagnie Mon√©gasque de Banque (1%). Mediobanca retained a 21.5% stake. In July 2005 Mediobanca sold 5% of Ferrari to Mubadala Development Company, an investment company wholly owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi. The deal saw Mubadala pay ‚Ç¨114 million to purchase the five percent stake. In October 2006 Fiat bought back the 29% stake still owned by the consortium, paying ‚Ç¨892 million. At the time of the transaction, Mediobanca owned an 11.7% stake, Commerzbank the 8.5%, ABN AMRO the 7,5% and Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna the 1,3%. In November 2010 Fiat paid ‚Ç¨122 million to buy back the last 5% stake owned by Mubadala Development. With this transaction, Fiat's stake in the luxury Italian car maker returned to 90%. 2014-2016 - The spin-off In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced its intentions to separate Ferrari from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari. The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of a 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the remainings steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with a 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari. On January 3, 2016, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and Ferrari N.V. announced the completion of separation of the Ferrari business from the FCA group on the same day, with trading on the Mercato Telematico Azionario set to begin on January 4, 2016, under the RACE ticker symbol and the ISIN code NL0011585146. 2017 - The Ferrari 70th Anniversary Ferrari celebrated the 70th anniversary of its foundation in 2017. 2019 - Scuderia Ferrari's 90th Anniversary Ferrari celebrated the 90th anniversary of its Scuderia.

The standard model was introduced in October 1969,and produced through 1979. The \\"Special\\" cruiser model was introduced in 1978 and produced through 1985. The XS650 began with the 1955 Hosk SOHC 500 twin. After about 10 years of producing 500 twin, Hosk engineers designed a 650 cc twin. Later the Hosk company was acquired by Showa Corporation, and in 1960 Yamaha had bought Showa with Hosk's early design of 650 cc twin. When the Yamaha XS 650 was launched in October 1969 it had one of the most advanced engines in its class of large parallel twin motorcycles. The engine and gearbox are unit construction with the crankcase split horizontally for ease of assembly whereas almost all contemporaries in its class in 1969 are either unit construction with a vertically split crankcase or pre-unit construction with separate engine and gearbox. The XS650's engine was used in AMA Professional Dirt Track Racing by national champion Kenny Roberts. In 1969 only the Laverda 750S, and the Honda CB350, also launched that year, matched the XS 650's modernity of unit construction and SOHC valve operation. Model history The 1970 model was designated the XS-1. Subsequent Yamaha Xs650 modelsYamaha Xs650 model ID table, Code, Serial Number, Year, Color(s) - Xs650chopper - Retrieved 2013-07-24 were XS-1B (1971), XS-2 (1972), then TX650/XS2B (1973), TX650-A (1974), XS650B (1975), XS650C (1976), XS-D (1977), XS-E (1978), XS-F (1979). 1979 was the last year of the so-called \\"Standards\\" (an unofficial term commonly used to differentiate it from the \\"Special,\\" which has pullback bars, a teardrop tank, and other differences in appearance). The Es and Fs also came in Special form: XS-SE (S for Special) and XS-SF. From then on they were Specials only to XS- SG, XS-SH, XS-SJ, XS-SK. There was a Special II (Two) model designation in 1978 (unknown) in 1979 (XS-SF-II), 1980 (XS-G), 1981 (XS-H) which were models with fewer chrome parts decals instead of plated plastic on the side covers as well as drum rear brake and wire wheels versus disc rear brake or cast wheels. The Special II was offered until 1985, the last year for the XS 650. The first two model years (XS-1 and XS-1B) were kick start only, with an electric starter added from the 1972 model year on. This had a compression release added to the front left exhaust tappet cover resulting in a square versus triangular cover found on the other exhaust and intake covers. Upon removal of the compression release mechanism in 1974 due to updated starter, the square cover at the left exhaust valve was continued. Brake modification notes: * Drum fronts on early models cannot be changed. * Pre '77 & post '77 fronts have different (offset) brake discs, the wheels swap but not the discs. * Drum rear wheel into rear disc frame needs the rear drum frame swingarm too. * Disk rear wheel into rear drum frame needs the rear disc frame swingarm and also needs brake master-cylinder lugs welded to the frame. Handling differences on swapping rear wheels:- * Standard rear tire is 110/90-18. Special rear tire is 130/90-16. Because the Standard tire is narrower it will tend to steer a bit more quickly. Because the Special tire is wider it will tend to be a bit steadier in a straight line. Overall gearing is not changed from the Standard, as the two tires are essentially the same outside diameter. Prior to the XS-B model, the bike had a reputation for speed wobbles but adjustments to the 1975 setup overcame these. 1976 models had the front brake caliper moved to the right fork leg, behind the fork as opposed to in front of the fork. This placed the brake caliper nearer the steering pivot center-line, requiring slightly less effort to steer. Mid-'77 the front forks had a major redesign: fork tube diameter increased from 34 to and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a dual piston cast iron design for the fork to a aluminum single piston floating caliper for the forks. The brake caliper mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the and forks so the calipers can't be swapped. =End of production= The XS 650 was produced until 1985. The last model year was 1983 in the United States, with Canada, Europe and other markets continuing into 1984 and 1985. However, many US models remained unsold for some years due to overproduction and an economic recession and brand new 1982 and 1983 models could still be purchased in 1987 at some dealerships. Design =Engine= Like the contemporaries in its class the XS 650 has a 360¬∞ crank angle. This provides an even firing interval between the two cylinders, but also generates some vibration caused by the two pistons rising and falling together. This vibration is particularly noticeable at idle. Because of a long-acknowledged vibration issue, starting with the 1974 models, vibration damping modifications were made to the engine and handlebar mountings. The XS 650s valves are operated by a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) whereas almost all contemporaries in its class have pushrod valvegear . The 360 degrees crankshaft uses three roller bearings and a ball bearing. The camshaft uses four ball bearings, and rolling bearings are used throughout the rest of the engine. Connecting rods turn on needle bearings. Since the engine is SOHC, there are no pushrods to operate the valves. The camshaft gets its drive from a single-row chain running from the center of the crankshaft. Chain tension is maintained by a spring-loaded guide, which also takes up unnecessary slack. The initial intake valve timing was changed in 1973 (EPA mandated) from a longer duration to a milder duration, this and other changes stifled the later models somewhat, the compression ratio also became lower over the years to match the milder cam timing, the flywheel is lighter than British contemporaries, this has the effect that the engine tends to pick up revs more rapidly when the throttle is opened quickly. During the later developments of the engine compression ratios were lowered, then raised. Pistons were lightened 20 percent along with connecting rods to reduce the reciprocating mass inside the engine. Aluminum pistons are slightly domed with valve pockets. Pistons have three rings installed, two compression and one oil control ring. Horizontal split of the crankcases offers the advantages of oil tightness through the elimination of vertical joints and one-step access to both the lower end and the gearbox. Oil pressure is provided by the trochoidal pump, driven by a steel spur gear off the crankshaft. The main bearings, transmission main shaft, clutch bushing, shifter fork guide bar, and rocker arms are lubricated by pressurized oil, whereas the rest of the engine is lubricated by ‚Äúoil splash, this includes the big ends .‚Äù =Carburetion= Pre-1980 models use the twin constant velocity Mikuni carburetors that can be tuned by moving the needle clip position, or by replacing jets. In the carburetors the velocity of the fuel mixture through the venturi, regulated by the opening of the butterfly valves and engine speed, causes a pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the carburetor pistons. This pressure difference raises and lowers the carburetor slides, increasing or decreasing engine output accordingly. Post-1979 models use smaller Mikuni CV carbs with needles that seem to be listed in parts menus as being 'fixed' position,(in other words a needle that may only have one clip position). The pilot and main jets can be changed for different sizes. If the CV carb needles only have one fixed clip position. =Ignition= The models up to 1979 use points ignition. Two sets of points are located on the upper left of the cylinder head. On the right side cylinder head, an advance mechanism is located. An advance mechanism is used to retard the timing for easy starting and smooth idle. Post-1979 models use electronic ignition systems. =Performance= Cycle World tested the XS650 in March 1979.This article originally appeared in \\"Cycle World\\" magazine March, 1979 It ran the standing- start quarter mile 13.86 seconds with a terminal speed of .

The first program was installed back in the 1960s, to help architects save time instead of drawing their blueprints. Computer-aided design also known as CAD was originally the type of program that architects used, but since CAD could not offer all the tools that architects needed to complete a project, CAAD developed as a distinct class of software.  Overview  All CAD and CAAD systems employ a database with geometric and other properties of objects; they all have some kind of graphic user interface to manipulate a visual representation rather than the database; and they are all more or less concerned with assembling designs from standard and non-standard pieces. Currently, the main distinction which causes one to speak of CAAD rather than CAD lies in the domain knowledge (architecture- specific objects, techniques, data, and process support) embedded in the system. A CAAD system differs from other CAD systems in two respects: *It has an explicit object database of building parts and construction knowledge. *It explicitly supports the creation of architectural objects. In a more general sense, CAAD also refers to the use of any computational technique in the field of architectural design other than by means of architecture-specific software. For example, software which is specifically developed for the computer animation industry (e.g. Maya and 3DStudio Max), is also used in architectural design. These programs can produce photo realistic 3d renders and animations. Nowadays real-time rendering is being popular thanks to the developments in graphic cards. The exact distinction of what properly belongs to CAAD is not always clear. Specialized software, for example for calculating structures by means of the finite element method, is used in architectural design and in that sense may fall under CAAD. On the other hand, such software is seldom used to create new designs. In 1974 Caad became a current word and was a common topic of commercial modernization. Three-dimensional objects CAAD has two types of structures in its program. The first system is surface structure which provides a graphics medium to represent three-dimensional objects using two-dimensional representations. Also algorithms that allow the generation of patterns and their analysis using programmed criteria, and data banks that store information about the problem at hand and the standards and regulations that applies to it. The second system is deep structure which means that the operations performed by the computer have natural limitations. Computer hardware and machine languages that are supported by these make it easy to perform arithmetical operations quickly and accurately. Also an almost illogical number of layers of symbolic processing can be built enabling the functionalities that are found at the surface. Advantages Another advantage to CAAD is the two way mapping of activities and functionalities. The two instances of mapping are indicated to be between the surface structures and the deep structures. These mappings are abstractions that are introduced in order to discuss the process of design and deployment of CAAD systems. In designing the systems the system developers usually consider surface structures. A one-to-one mapping is the typical statement, which is to develop a computer based functionality that maps as closely as possible into a corresponding manual design activity, for example, drafting of stairs, checking spatial conflict between building systems, and generating perspectives from orthogonal views. The architectural design processes tend to integrate models isolated so far. Many different kinds of expert knowledge, tools, visualization techniques, and media are to be combined. The design process covers the complete life cycle of the building. The areas that are covered are construction, operations, reorganization, as well as destruction. Considering the shared use of digital design tools and the exchange of information and knowledge between designers and across different projects, we speak of a design continuum. An architect's work involves mostly visually represented data. Problems are often outlined and dealt with in a graphical approach. Only this form of expression serves as a basis for work and discussion. Therefore, the designer should have maximum visual control over the processes taking place within the design continuum. Further questions occur about navigation, associative information access, programming and communication within very large data sets.

Bruno Taut's best-known building, the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion of which only black and white images survive today, was in reality a brightly colored landmark. Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer designed a model factory for the exhibition. The Belgian architect Henri van de Velde designed a model theatre. Berlin-based Margarete Knuppelholz-Roeser designed the controversial Haus Der Frau. The exhibition happened mainly on the initiative of the later German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, then a 36-year- old aspiring inventor, Werkbund member and local politician at Cologne. The city spent the luxurious sum of 5 million Goldmarks (equivalent to million ‚Ç¨) on the event. Planning began in earnest in 1912, and construction work started in early 1914. The exhibition was opened to the public by Van de Velde on May 15th, 1914. Scheduled to last until the end of October, it was prematurely shut down on August 8th, in reaction to the outbreak of World War I a week earlier; the exhibition buildings were dismantled shortly afterwards. There were two more Werkbund Exhibitions after the war. The second was the Stuttgart Exhibition of 1927, which included the Weissenhof Estate. At that time, the third Werkbund Exhibition had been tentatively scheduled for 1937, but the plan was shelved in 1932 because of the Great Depression and could not be taken up again since the Nazis opposed and ultimately outlawed the Werkbund. It finally took place on a reduced scale in 1949, back in Cologne, and turned out to be the last Werkbund Exhibition.

The band was formed in 1981 by the composer and pianist Kristian Blak, who has written most of the material for the group. From the very beginning, Yggdrasil has included musicians from other countries, having varied musical backgrounds, mainly in jazz, but also in ethnic, folk, rock and classical music. Most works have been created in relation with other forms of art: visual art, poetry, ballet, opera - or in some cases, with nature (concertos in sea caves).

UDLs are generally located in large cities throughout the United States and work predominantly with minority students. History =Early years= There were various initiatives surrounding debate in urban areas in the early 1980s in Atlanta, Detroit, and Philadelphia. The 1960s saw a rapid expansion of interscholastic forensics - competitive speech and debate. Rapid growth by the National Forensic League and the forensic community as a whole was matched by a growing number of metropolitan leagues intended to increase tournament opportunities in areas where a number of speech and debate programs existed. The Philadelphia Senior High School Debate League was started in the School District in the mid-1960s. By 1965, a large Metro Forensic League which included speech, theater, and debate competition developed in Nashville, Tennessee. Many of those programs simply merged into the overall forensics community, but some continued to flourish as specialized, localized communities. By the early 1980s, approximately 30 Philadelphia teams were meeting once a week after school at Olney High School doing Policy Debate. The league became the Philadelphia Scholastic Debate League in 2007 with the support of the After School Activities Partnerships (ASAP) and switched to Public Forum debate in 2008. In the 1980s, the face of high school debate began to change. A growing awareness of the unequal access to debate spurred some individuals to focus on the need to expand access to disadvantaged groups in urban areas. Traditionally left out by financial constraints, many inner-city school students were completely excluded. The Detroit Public Debate League began in 1984 as an after-school partnership between the Detroit Gifted and Talented Program and Wayne State University Director of Debate George Ziegelmueller.Ziegellmueller, George. ‚ÄúThe Detroit Experience,‚Äù Contemporary Argumentation and Debate 19 (1998): 85. While developed as a \\"gifted\\" program, it was open to all Detroit communities and brought many socio-economically disadvantaged students into the activity. In Atlanta, the Urban Debate League was born as a graduate school research paper in 1983 that explored the hypothesis that debate might be a tool to level the playing field in education, and that words might be used to reduce violence in America‚Äôs cities. The initial Atlanta UDL was formed as a partnership between the Barkley Forum of Emory University and the Atlanta Public Schools. The concept took root and flourished, and by 1985, it was a fully established league.\\"The Atlanta Urban Debate League: A Case Study in Sustainability\\", Seventh Diversity Recruitment and Retention in Debate Ideafest, Open Society Institute, New York, New York, June 2002. Early program support for urban debate initiatives was granted through the National Forensic League and Phillips Petroleum by the early 1990s. Significant seed funding was then provided by the Open Society Institute (OSI) in the Spring of 1997 to take the initiative national, and OSI chose the Atlanta Urban Debate League model as the template to model in other cities.Building Open Societies: Soros Foundations Network 1997 Report: 166. As a result, Atlanta has traditionally been thought to be the basis for the urban debate network. By 2010, more than 40,000 urban public school students had competed in UDL tournaments, coming from over 400 high schools. The once predominantly white, suburban activity has changed to more accurately reflect American society. And the tireless efforts of the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues, the Associated Leaders of Urban Debate, and the National Debate Project continue to promote, support, and assess this important educational reform movement. =The Open Society Institute and New Leagues= The most crucial component in making the Urban Debate League a national education reform movement was seed funding from George Soros‚Äô Open Society Institute. In the spring of 1997, OSI launched its High School Debate Grantmaking Program, the purpose of which was to support initiatives that seek to institutionalize competitive debate opportunities in high schools in traditionally underserved communities. OSI already had a tradition of supporting high school debate through its network of foundations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where OSI had demonstrated that participation in debate fostered the skills that empower young people to actively participate as citizens of open society.Breger, Beth. ‚ÄúBuilding Open Societies Through Debate,‚Äù Contemporary Argumentation and Debate 19 (1998): 66. After the successful establishment at a successful Urban Debate League in New York City based on the Atlanta model, OSI continued its support for the Atlanta and New York City leagues. By 2000, OSI had provided seed and support funding for leagues in Detroit, Tuscaloosa, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, the San Francisco Bay area, Baltimore, Providence, and Southern California. Before ending the program, they had provided funding for the establishment of UDLs, adding Los Angeles, and Newark. All of those leagues are still operating in 2010, and continue to serve students and provide educational opportunities that would otherwise not exist. That continued operation shows that the OSI initiative has been a great success in creating a program that would be able to gain public and private support in order to continue even when the initial OSI grants ended. The contributions of OSI and other funders has led multiple other donors to bring to fruition Urban Debate Leagues in their own cities. For instance, Friends of the Miami Dade Urban Debate League‚Äîa group of individuals, corporations, and foundations‚Äîestablished an Urban Debate League in Miami in 2005. In 2006, a league formed in Boston. Since that time, it has received support from The Boston Public Schools, the Boston Foundation, The Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation, Social Venture Partners, Edvestors, The Mentor Network, The Harbus Foundation, the GMA Foundation, and the A.C. Ratshesky Foundation. Also, the Einhorn Charitable Trust provided funding to found a UDL in Milwaukee in 2006.Einhorn Family Charitable Trust Establishes Debate Program in Milwaukee Schools Milwaukee Debate League. Retrieved September 1, 2008. As of October 2008, the Milwaukee program is no longer administered through or associated with Marquette University. In 2007, the Dallas Urban Debate Alliance brought debate to the Dallas Independent School District. In 2008, a group of former high school and college debaters founded the Houston Urban Debate League to bring debate to at risk students in Houston. The Houston Independent School Board partnered with that group to support the start up of a 15 school league for the 2008-2009 school year. Also in 2008, a former parochial high school debater with the assistance of the NAUDL formed the Memphis Urban Debate League Advisory Board and partnered with Memphis City Schools to establish a 15 school league for the 2008-2009 school year (www.memphisdebate.org). The Community Education Initiative is leading an effort to establish a new UDL in Nashville for the 2010-2011 school year. The league being formed represents a collaboration between the Community Education Initiative, the Metro Nashville Public Schools, the Metro Forensic League, the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues, and the National Debate Project. All over the country, funders, universities, and individuals who are called to make a difference in their communities are partnering to bring the benefits of debate to disenfranchised youth. in 2015, a new Urban Debate League was formed in Washington D.C. (WUDL) to further expand the network.http://www.urbandebatewashingtondc.org =UDLs today= With the growth of Urban Debate Leagues across the country, there are several national entities that are committed to reaching as many students as possible with the power of debate. In 2002 the National Association for Urban Debate Leagues was created to provide national leadership of the Urban Debate Network. The National Debate Project (NDP)‚Äîa consortium of Emory University, Georgia State University, Tennessee State University, Clark Atlanta University, and New York University‚Äîworks in the field of education reform, and promotes debate as a tool for empowering urban and rural youth living in America‚Äôs most socio- economically challenged communities. In 2003 urban debate moved into national prominence with an article in U.S. News & World Report and a feature story on 60 Minutes about the Baltimore Urban Debate League. The sudden attention and the reduction of OSI support led to the formation of the National Debate Project in Atlanta and domestic activities by the International Debate Education Association (IDEA). At about this time Urban Debate Leagues began to develop their connections with the growing after-school programs movement: in 2004 and 2005 the NAUDL was invited to make presentations at the National Institute for Out of School Time and the Alliance for Excellent Education annual conferences.Alliance for Excellent Education, Second Annual High School Policy Conference, Oct. 5, 2004 . Retrieved September 1, 2008. In 2005, the Associated Leaders of Urban Debate (ALOUD) was formed, led by New York University (NYU) President John Sexton and Pitney Bowes CEO Michael Critelli. Major press coverage of the Urban Debate League movement and NDP projects has been featured in the New York Times, U.S. News and World Report, Seattle Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Teacher Magazine, Chronicle for Higher Education, Christian Science Monitor, the White House official website, and on CBS' 60 Minutes.In the news NDP website (hosted by Georgia State University).

Current UDLs and associations Funding The goal of the OSI's Urban Debate Program was to offer initial support to fund debate programs within urban communities, develop local stakeholders (e.g., university partners, community funders and school system support) and then to exit the equation. The concept was once local actors see the value of the program, sustaining investment in debate would become easier. Today, Urban Debate Leagues are funded primarily by one of three local institutions: urban public school systems, non-profit organizations dedicated to establishing a local UDL, or university debate programs engaged in community outreach. How it works Most UDLs function in their own unique way, and use different teaching methods to familiarize urban students with the format and application of policy debate. Most urban debate leagues recruit and train urban educators as coaches, though many also use university debaters or former debaters within the community to serve as assistant coaches. While all UDLs attempt to recruit volunteer support (e.g., tournament judges, tournament tab room coordinators, and lecturers at debate workshops for students), certain core costs of a UDL must be funded in order for the program to be sustainable including coach stipends, debate materials, and transportation to tournaments. Local debate programs have spawned other methods to integrate debate into their communities. Urban debate has expanded to include debate across the curriculum (as a classroom learning tool), public debates (partnering with community-based organizations), debates in prisons, and middle school competitions. UDLs have demonstrated a very high level of cost-effectiveness, averaging less than $650 per student for a year's involvement in a program that researchers and media observers have widely recognized as unusually intensive in its academic focus, relative to other after-school programs.

Potter then told him about Betsy, and the vigilante responded that he might be able to stop Fisk from hurting anyone else, including Betsy, with Melvin's help. Melvin agreed to make him a new suit and the vigilante asked him to make a symbol. Melvin started working on a body armor that could offered protection without giving away speed and agility, also adding small Devil horns to the mask.

A Lorentz scalar may be generated from e.g., the scalar product of vectors, or from contracting tensors of the theory. While the components of vectors and tensors are in general altered under Lorentz transformations, Lorentz scalars remain unchanged. A Lorentz scalar is not always immediately seen to be an invariant scalar in the mathematical sense, but the resulting scalar value is invariant under any basis transformation applied to the vector space, on which the considered theory is based. A simple Lorentz scalar in Minkowski spacetime is the spacetime distance (\\"length\\" of their difference) of two fixed events in spacetime. While the \\"position\\"-4-vectors of the events change between different inertial frames, their spacetime distance remains invariant under the corresponding Lorentz transformation. Other examples of Lorentz scalars are the \\"length\\" of 4-velocities (see below), or the Ricci curvature in a point in spacetime from General relativity, which is a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor there. Simple scalars in special relativity =The length of a position vector= World lines for two particles at different speeds. In special relativity the location of a particle in 4-dimensional spacetime is given by : x^{\\\\mu} = (ct, \\\\mathbf{x} ) where \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{v} t is the position in 3-dimensional space of the particle, \\\\mathbf{v} is the velocity in 3-dimensional space and c is the speed of light. The \\"length\\" of the vector is a Lorentz scalar and is given by : x_{\\\\mu} x^{\\\\mu} = \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} x^{\\\\mu} x^{ u} = (ct)^2 - \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ (c\\\\tau)^2 where \\\\tau is the proper time as measured by a clock in the rest frame of the particle and the Minkowski metric is given by :\\\\eta^{\\\\mu u} =\\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. This is a time-like metric. Often the alternate signature of the Minkowski metric is used in which the signs of the ones are reversed. :\\\\eta^{\\\\mu u} =\\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. This is a space-like metric. In the Minkowski metric the space-like interval s is defined as : x_{\\\\mu} x^{\\\\mu} = \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} x^{\\\\mu} x^{ u} = \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} - (ct)^2 \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ s^2 . We use the space-like Minkowski metric in the rest of this article. =The length of a velocity vector= The velocity vectors in spacetime for a particle at two different speeds. In relativity an acceleration is equivalent to a rotation in spacetime The velocity in spacetime is defined as : v^{\\\\mu} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {dx^{\\\\mu} \\\\over d\\\\tau} = \\\\left (c {dt \\\\over d\\\\tau}, { dt \\\\over d\\\\tau}{d\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\over dt} \\\\right ) = \\\\left ( \\\\gamma c, \\\\gamma { \\\\mathbf{v} } \\\\right ) = \\\\gamma \\\\left ( c, { \\\\mathbf{v} } \\\\right ) where : \\\\gamma \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ { 1 \\\\over {\\\\sqrt {1 - {{\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} } \\\\over c^2} } } } . The magnitude of the 4-velocity is a Lorentz scalar, : v_{\\\\mu} v^{\\\\mu} = -c^2\\\\,. Hence, c is a Lorentz scalar. =The inner product of acceleration and velocity= The 4-acceleration is given by : a^{\\\\mu} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {dv^{\\\\mu} \\\\over d\\\\tau} . The 4-acceleration is always perpendicular to the 4-velocity : 0 = {1 \\\\over 2} {d \\\\over d\\\\tau} \\\\left ( v_{\\\\mu}v^{\\\\mu} \\\\right ) = {d v_{\\\\mu} \\\\over d\\\\tau} v^{\\\\mu} = a_{\\\\mu} v^{\\\\mu} . Therefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation: : {d E \\\\over d\\\\tau} = \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot { \\\\mathbf{v}} where E is the energy of a particle and \\\\mathbf{F} is the 3-force on the particle. Energy, rest mass, 3-momentum, and 3-speed from 4-momentum The 4-momentum of a particle is : p^{\\\\mu} = m v^{\\\\mu} = \\\\left ( \\\\gamma m c, \\\\gamma { m \\\\mathbf{v} } \\\\right ) = \\\\left ( \\\\gamma m c, { \\\\mathbf{p} } \\\\right ) = \\\\left ( {E \\\\over c } , { \\\\mathbf{p} } \\\\right ) where m is the particle rest mass, \\\\mathbf{p} is the momentum in 3-space, and : E = \\\\gamma m c^2 \\\\, is the energy of the particle. =Measurement of the energy of a particle= Consider a second particle with 4-velocity u and a 3-velocity \\\\mathbf{u}_2 . In the rest frame of the second particle the inner product of u with p is proportional to the energy of the first particle : p_{\\\\mu} u^{\\\\mu} = - { E_1} where the subscript 1 indicates the first particle. Since the relationship is true in the rest frame of the second particle, it is true in any reference frame. E_1 , the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle, is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, : { E_1} = \\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2 m_1 c^2 - \\\\gamma_2 \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}_2 in any inertial reference frame, where E_1 is still the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle . =Measurement of the rest mass of the particle= In the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is : p_{\\\\mu} p^{\\\\mu} = - (mc)^2 \\\\,. Therefore, the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated. In many cases the rest mass is written as m_{0} to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is \\\\gamma m_{0} =Measurement of the 3-momentum of the particle= Note that : \\\\left ( p_{\\\\mu} u^{\\\\mu} /c \\\\right ) ^2 + p_{\\\\mu} p^{\\\\mu} = { E_1^2 \\\\over c^2 } -(mc)^2 = \\\\left ( \\\\gamma_1^2 -1 \\\\right ) (mc)^2 = \\\\gamma_1^2 { {\\\\mathbf{v}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}_1 } }m^2 = \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}_1. The square of the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the particle as measured in the frame of the second particle is a Lorentz scalar. =Measurement of the 3-speed of the particle= The 3-speed, in the frame of the second particle, can be constructed from two Lorentz scalars : v_1^2 = \\\\mathbf{v}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}_1 = { { \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{p}_1 c^4 } \\\\over { E_1^2 } } . More complicated scalars Scalars may also be constructed from the tensors and vectors, from the contraction of tensors (such as F_{\\\\mu u}F^{\\\\mu u}), or combinations of contractions of tensors and vectors (such as g_{\\\\mu u}x^{\\\\mu}x^{ u}).

When the high-society organised the first Vienna ball in the Vilnius City Hall, he organised a party for the poor people in the square just outside the building. The Vienna ball did not take place the following year, which many people regarded as a victory for ≈†ustauskas, as the idea became unpopular among members of high society. These events raised the popularity of the Lithuanian Liberty Union, as many poorer people already saw high society as a den for corrupt thieves; the ideology which was propagated during communism, and was supported by several scandals in the 90s. The fact that ≈†ustauskas sold his car and invested much of his own funds into these parties for poor people also helped his popularity. However, his and Liberty Union's popularity distribution over Lithuania was very uneven: it was most popular in ≈†ustauskas's hometown Kaunas, but was lacking elsewhere in the country. The Lithuanian Liberty Union gained a majority in Kaunas city municipality council, and ≈†ustauskas became mayor of Kaunas. Later he was elected to the parliament of one of the electoral districts of Kaunas city. After this his popularity dwindled, as little was achieved, and there were several scandals concerning one member of his party, Enrikas Daktaras, son of Henrikas Daktaras (godfather of local mafia).

Publication history Smasher first appeared in X-Men #107 (October 1977-February 1978), and was created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum. A new Smasher, named Isabel Kane, appears as a member of the Avengers in the Marvel NOW! relaunch. Her name was originally given as \\"Isabel Dare\\", but the collected edition of her first appearance said her surname was \\"Kane\\". According to editor Tom Brevoort, this change was deliberate; he even stated that \\"Dare was a mistake in the first place,\\" as the character was intended to be Captain Terror's granddaughter from her first appearance.New Brevoort Formspring Yet more Smashers, operating directly under Imperial control, appear in the 'Infinity' crossover.Wolverine and the X-Men Annual #1 (Nov. 2013) Fictional character biography The title of Smasher has been used by three different humanoid aliens who served in the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. =Vril Rokk= The first Smasher was Vril Rokk, who had a long, distinguished service with the Guard. He was also romantically linked with fellow Guardsman Plutonia. In Untold Tales of Captain Marvel ‚Äî which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men ‚Äî Smasher, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree all meet. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls. They later are involved with a confrontation against the Brood.Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel #1-3 (1997) When Cassandra Nova was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress Lilandra. Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed. He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her. Smasher is later killed by Vulcan, a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire. =Salac Tuur= Vril Rokk is soon replaced with another Smasher, Salac Tuur. The new Smasher was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld during the wedding of Crystal and Ronan the Accuser. During the battle, Smasher was slain by the Inhuman Karnak.War of Kings #1 (March 2009) =Third Smasher= The uniform and title of Smasher has since been passed onto an unidentified member of the original's race.War of Kings #3 (May 2009) However, the newest version of Smasher was killed by Gladiator during a raid performed by Starjammers and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Strontian praetor killed Smasher as a sign of defecting to Lilandra. =Izzy Kane= A new Smasher appears in the Marvel NOW! relaunch as part of Captain America's new Avengers line-up.Avengers vol. 5 #1 (December 2012) She joins the Avengers to help fight Ex Nihilo on Mars.Avengers vol. 5 #2 She is revealed to be Isabel \\"Izzy\\" Kane, a college student and astronomer from Iowa. After finding a pair of high-tech goggles that had been left behind in a cornfield by Vril Rokk when he crashed to the Earth to warn the X-Men about Cassandra Nova, Izzy becomes the new Smasher and Earth's first member of the Imperial Guard. Izzy is introduced to Captain America by her grandfather Dan Kane, an acquaintance from World War II.Avengers vol. 5 #5 As part of the Avengers, Izzy meets the Guardians of the Galaxy when their ship is ambushed and crashes into a mall's parking lot.Guardians Team Up #1-2 (May 2015) When the source of mysterious seismic events was revealed to be A.I.M.

Troopers.Avengers World #1 Smasher was chosen by Andrew Forson and Jude the Entropic Man to become his Messenger for the secret of the universe, that \\"Everything dies.\\" Smasher is made to do so by Andrew Forson.Avengers World #2 She is later seen eight months in the future as seen in the Time Runs Out storyline having started a family with teammate Sam Guthrie.Avengers #35 (Sept. 2014) She later rejoins with an Avengers team headed by Roberto DaCosta and Thor. Their goal is to find the threat causing the slow death of the multiverse and to kill it. This brings Smasher in direct opposition with Captain America's group.Avengers #39 - #40 Sometime later, Smasher is seen with Cannonball and their son on another planet discussing about their future together, which leads to Cannonball deciding to quit the U.S.Avengers so that he could be with his family full time.U.S.Avengers #5 In the aftermath of the Secret Empire storyline, Smasher arrives on Earth and tells Sunspot that Cannonball, who was believed to be dead, is alive on another planet.U.S.Avengers #10 =Monster= A new Smasher not affiliated with the Imperial Guard was introduced in Monsters Unleashed. This version is a creation of Kid Kaiju that is composed of him and his five monsters Slizzik, Hi-Vo, Aegis, Scragg and Mekara. They come together to battle the Leviathon Mother when the Leviathon Tide invaded Earth.Monsters Unleashed Vol. 2 #5 Powers and abilities Like his predecessors, Smasher could naturally absorb cosmic radiation from his environment in order to increase his strength to superhuman levels. Smasher wore special goggles called \\"exospex\\" that enabled him to \\"download\\" additional superhuman powers. Via the exospex, he could obtain \\"penta-vision\\" (a form of X-ray vision), superhuman durability, even greater physical strength, and the ability to travel into hyperspace (\\"4-space\\"). Smasher was only capable of downloading one superpower at a time. Smasher wore small anti-gravity \\"flight patches\\" that enabled him to fly. Flight patches are standard issue for Imperial Guardsmen who lack the power of flight.

The daughter of Scott Lang, the character first appeared in Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979) as Cassie Lang, in Young Avengers #6 (May 2006) as Stature and in Astonishing Ant-Man #6 (May 2016) as Stinger. A member of the Young Avengers and The Initiative, she has the same powers as her father, the ability to shrink and grow in size; however, she manifested her powers long after her first exposure to Pym Particles. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, the character was portrayed by Abby Ryder Fortson in Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and by Emma Fuhrmann in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Publication history Created by David Michelinie and John Byrne, Cassie Lang first appeared in Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979). She first appeared as Stature in Young Avengers #6 (May 2006), and adopted the identity of Stinger in The Astonishing Ant-Man #6 (May 2016). Fictional character biography =Ant-Man's daughter= Cassie Lang is introduced to the Marvel Universe as the ill daughter of Scott Lang. Her congenital heart condition forces her father to steal Hank Pym's Ant-Man equipment and Pym Particles, which he uses to rescue Doctor Sondheim, the only doctor able to cure Cassie's condition, from Cross Technological Enterprises.Marvel Premiere #47 After the divorce of her parents, Cassie lives for most of her childhood with her father, whom she loves and admires greatly. Although Scott tries his best to keep his superhero life secret, Cassie gradually finds out that he is Ant-Man, and secretly experiments with his Pym Particle supplies on her own.Young Avengers #3 (2005) She is fascinated by her father's life as a superhero, and generally has a good relationship with her father's colleagues; when she was younger, she even called Tony Stark \\"Uncle Tony\\". Scott's time as an engineer for the Fantastic Four brings Cassie to the team's then-headquarters of Four Freedoms Plaza. In the spectacular environment Cassie calls home, she forges a strong friendship with the former ward of Doctor Doom, Kristoff Vernard. During the time they share a home with the Fantastic Four, Cassie helps Kristoff adjust to life outside of Doom's castle, and she develops a crush on him. It is also during this time that she meets her father in his Ant-Man identity, and confesses that she had known about it for a long time.Fantastic Four Vol.1 #405 (October 1995) After the Fantastic Four go missing and Cassie's father finds himself without a job, Scott takes employment at Oracle, Inc. with the Heroes for Hire (H4H). While working with the Heroes for Hire, Cassie has further adventures, accidentally activating the Super-Adaptoid and receiving horrifying visions of things to come. The H4H easily defeated Super-Adaptoid, and Cassie's participation in these dark events help her father and his allies defeat Master of the World in a battle for the fate of the Earth. All of these adventures give Cassie a taste for the action-filled life of a superhero, but it causes her mother to take sole custody from Scott. As a result of Cassie being kept away from her father Scott, she grows more and more bitter toward her mother, and even more so toward her stepfather Blake Burdick. As a police officer, he cannot stand the world of superheroes the young girl loves, and he unsuccessfully tries to keep Cassie and Scott apart. For years, Cassie visits her father whenever possible, much to her mother and stepfather's chagrin, until the events of \\"Avengers Disassembled\\", when Scott is killed due to the actions of an insane Scarlet Witch.Avengers #500 Cassie retreats into herself, blaming Blake for being unable to understand her as her father always did. Blake tries unsuccessfully to be a caring stepfather, despite being sometimes distant toward her, seeing his stepdaughter as a \\"less than brilliant\\" girl. Some time after her father's death, and after another confrontation with her mother and stepfather, Cassie decides to run away to Los Angeles to join the Runaways, but after seeing the \\"Young Avengers\\" on television just before leaving, she subsequently changes her plans, as she later tells Jessica Jones.Young Avengers #2-3 (May‚ÄìJune 2005) =Young Avengers= Cassandra Lang in her first costume from Young Avengers Special #1 (December 2005). Art by Neal Adams. Iron Lad, a younger version of classic Avengers foe Kang the Conqueror, desperate for help against his future self after learning what he will become, uses the Vision's database to track and recruit young superpowered individuals connected to the Avengers' history; however, Cassie Lang is not one of the individuals on the list. Wishing to join the Young Avengers, she and Kate Bishop meet the young heroes at the Avengers Mansion; when they refuse to let them join or to let her take her father's gear, she angrily rebukes them, only to discover much to her own shock that by doing so she had increased her size. She later confesses that she had repeatedly stolen Pym particles from her father for years, but until then it seemed they never had any effect on her. Cassie later displays the ability to also shrink.Young Avengers Vol. 1 # 2-5 Iron Lad assures her that if Vision had known she had developed powers, she would have been part of his plans for the Young Avengers, thus accepting her as a teammate; she then takes part in the battle against Kang, which ends in the villain's defeat. However, as the altered timeline causes several of them to disappear, Iron Lad realizes that he must return to his own time and accept the fact that he will become Kang, much to Cassie's sorrow, as she had fallen in love with him.Young Avengers Vol. 1 # 5-6 While Captain America and Iron Man order the team to disband, both Cassie and Kate refuse and convince the others to keep the team active; after initially considering Ant-Girl or Giant- Girl, she ultimately adopts the codename Stature, along with a new costume based on her father's. Despite this, she feels guilty when overhearing her mother and stepfather discussing the possibility of her being a member of the team, also showing that rage or guilt make her respectively grow or shrink, metaphorically reflecting her being a shrinking violet about her family issues.Young Avengers Vol. 1 # 6-7 After deciding to continue her life as a superhero, Cassie overhears her stepfather talking to her mother. They suspect that she is secretly Stature, but refuse to believe it. Later, Jessica Jones talks to Cassie's mother and confirms Cassie's dual identity. Cassie's mother is overwhelmed by this news and begs Jessica not to tell her husband about this due to his hatred of superheroes; she also worries that although Cassie was cured of her heart condition, her heart might not be able to handle the strain of continuous size-changing.Young Avengers Vol. 1 # 7 When Jessica Jones asks Cassie if there isn't even a small part of her wishing for a normal life, Cassie replies, \\"Ms. Jones, my dad was Ant-Man. I never had a normal life.\\" Young Avengers Special #1 In the Civil War limited series, Cassie, along with her fellow Young Avengers, join Captain America's resistance to the Superhero Registration Act; she and the rest of her team stay at a safe house, while Nick Fury arranges new secret identities for them. During this time, she participates in a rescue effort, which turns out to be a trap laid by Iron Man: during the subsequent battle, Goliath is killed by a clone of Thor and her teammate Wiccan is captured. Afterwards, Cassie opts to leave Captain America's side and to register, citing her reasons as wishing to fight villains rather than cops and other heroes.Civil War #4 =The Initiative= Cassie Lang joins the Initiative, as a trainee. Along with fellow Initiative members Dusk, Tigra, Silverclaw, and Ara√±a, she is ensnared by the Puppet Master.Ms. Marvel vol 2 #18 Although she (along with the others) is mentally controlled into fighting Ms. Marvel, she is eventually freed from the mind control.Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #20 Her time at Camp Hammond brings her in to contact with her father's successor as Ant-Man: Eric O'Grady. O'Grady makes several disparaging remarks about her father, not realizing that she is within earshot; this causes a literally giant-sized brawl between the two as both grow to their giant forms. After O'Grady picks up a bus and hits Lang with it, Henry Pym intervenes. Taskmaster breaks up the fight by attacking their now giant-sized Achilles tendons, bringing all three crashing to the ground.Avengers: The Initiative #8 Later, the Vision visits Cassie, disguising himself as Tony Stark in order to take her out on a date. After fighting off an attempt by A.I.M. to steal the Vision, he confesses that because he was programmed based on Iron Lad's mental patterns, he shares Iron Lad's attraction to her, and hopes that she can love him; Cassie is unsure, but does not reject him, telling him to give her time to sort things out.Young Avengers Presents #4 Cassie accidentally injures her stepfather Blake while stopping the Growing Man. Her guilt causes her to continue shrinking down, and the other Young Avengers attempt to snap her out of it before she shrinks into non-existence. With the help of Patriot, she comes to terms with the responsibilities and risks of her position as part of the Young Avengers and the Initiative, reasoning that Blake also faces the risks as a policeman.Young Avengers Presents #5 =Secret Invasion= Stature fights against the Skrull invasion of Manhattan as part of the Initiative.Secret Invasion #3 She grows larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket and punches him out.Secret Invasion #7 =Dark Reign= In the aftermath of the Skrull invasion, Cassie Lang leaves the Initiative at the start of the Dark Reign storyline and rejoins the Young Avengers. Cassie and Vision (now seemingly in a relationship) fly to the Avengers Mansion ruins, having been summoned by Wiccan with warnings of a great magical threat. After finding their teammates turned to stone, they encounter the Scarlet Witch transporting them away to be a part of the Mighty Avengers, led by Hank Pym.Mighty Avengers Vol. 1 #21 (March 2009) Despite her evident and vocal distrust of Scarlet Witch, whom she holds responsible for her father's death, she remains on the team. During a confrontation with the Fantastic Four for a device of the late Bill Foster, she refuses to participate in the attack and instead warns them about what was really happening, citing her reluctance to fight those she feels are like family to her.Mighty Avengers #25-26 (July, August 2009) Eventually, Cassie's distrust of Scarlet Witch leads her to expose her as Loki in disguise.Mighty Avengers #27-30 (Dec. 2009) While part of the team, Lang also fights a demi-god at Mount WundagoreMighty Avengers Vol. 1 #23 (May 2009) and a homicidal ancient Inhuman.Mighty Avengers Vol. 1 #28 (October 2009) Norman Osborn later mounts a full-scale attack on Asgard. Teaming up with the rest of the Mighty Avengers one last time, Cassie and Vision help stop the Thunderbolts from delivering Odin's Spear (an Asgardian weapon of virtually limitless power) to the Iron Patriot; in the battle, she also fights the new Ant-Man again.Siege #1-4 (January 2010 - May 2010)Thunderbolts Vol. 1 #141-143 =Heroic Age= At some point, Cassie applies for a babysitter job with Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, though more in the hope of eventually finding her way into the ranks of the New Avengers rather than any dedication to babysitting itself; she is dismissed in favor of Squirrel Girl.New Avengers #7 =The Children's Crusade and death= When Wiccan's uncontrolled magical energy nearly kills several members of the Sons of the Serpent, the Avengers begin to fear that he might become another Scarlet Witch; they explain to the Young Avengers how the Scarlet Witch went insane after the loss of her twin boys, resulting in the death of the original Vision and Scott Lang, and rendering nearly all of the world's mutants powerless. When Wiccan feels unsure about what to do, Cassie suggests that they try to find the Scarlet Witch, believing that if they can show her that her children are alive, she may be able to reverse everything she has done, including her father's death. During the team's search in Latveria, Cassie is reunited with Iron Lad, and, when he takes the team back to the period of Avengers Disassembled, she is able to bring her father forward in time to the present, avoiding his original death from the attack by Jack of Hearts. After she manifests her powers in front of him, Scott tells her he's proud of her. After the Scarlet Witch is found, Dr. Doom steals her reality warping powers and fights the combined forces of the Avengers and X-Men. As Doom seemingly kills her father (who actually managed to shrink down and escape with minor wounds), a distraught Cassie charges the super-powered dictator, gaining time for Scarlet Witch and Wiccan to prepare a joint spell to remove his new powers; however, Doom retaliates by blasting Cassie with an explosive spell, killing her. Although Iron Lad offers to take her into the future to save her, his offer is rejected by the other Young Avengers, as it is more in line with what Kang would do than what an Avenger should do. While contemplating rebuilding the Vision (who Iron Lad destroyed in rage when he protested against his plans to save Cassie), the Young Avengers realize that they would have to tell a restored Vision about Cassie's death, and thus decide not to follow through with the rebuilding. Kate expresses her desire to believe that Vision and Cassie are somehow together in the afterlife. The team disbands and a statue of Cassie and the Vision's is built in their honor in the gardens of the mansion. =Resurrection= Cassie Lang from Avengers World #16 (December 2014). Art by Ramon Rosanas. Bentley 23 (a clone of Wizard) of the Future Foundation later postulates that, due to the unstable nature of Pym Particles, Cassie's body could conceivably regenerate into an ionic form similar to the resurrection of Wonder Man; he suggests digging up the corpse to check, stating that he is sure his classmates are thinking the same thing.FF (vol. 2) #16 During the AXIS storyline, Doctor Doom is transformed into a more heroic, altruistic form as a result of the battle with the Red Skull that involved a spell that inverted heroes and villains' personalities. Seeking redemption for his past crimes, but only able to draw on enough power to alter one key event, Doom chooses to use that power to resurrect Cassie. She is then seen tearfully reuniting with her father and his new girlfriend Darla Deering.Avengers World #16 In the Ant-Man ongoing series, she is shown living a normal life as a middle-school student. Worried that Scott's lifestyle and actions might attract more danger to her, Cassie's mother decides to relocate to Miami despite Cassie's reluctance. Scott nonetheless decides to relocate there as well to stay near his daughter.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #1 She is later kidnapped by Crossfire on behalf of Augustine Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises; Cross believes that Cassie's Pym Particle- irradiated heart can sustain Darren Cross's sickly body.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #3-4 Scott didn't arrive in time to prevent the transplant of Cassie's heart (which caused the revived Darren Cross to shrink uncontrollably) and so Dr. Sondheim was forced to transplant another one in Cassie's body, with Scott slowing down her immune system enough to make sure it is not rejected. While Cassie survived, not knowing herself what had happened to her, Scott was so shaken up by that experience that he decided to leave her, reasoning that he cannot risk to put her in harm's way again and that she deserves a normal and happy life he cannot provide.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #5 A now depowered Cassie struggles with her everyday activities, while feeling frustrated by her current status; feeling resentful over Scott's seeming disappearance, she is later shocked and outraged to find out that he was secretly following her around, watching over her. One day, she is reunited with Kate, who has found out about her resurrection; despite her lack of powers, she follows her friend to a Secret Empire hideout, but almost gets killed, which further fuels her frustration, despite Kate's assurances that she is still special her own way. However, Cassie ultimately decides to turn to the new Power Broker to regain her powers; although he realizes that she has no intention of actually becoming a supervillain, he tells her about Darren Cross having stolen her heart and that her father hid it from her. Power Broker offers a deal, in which he will grant her wish if she infiltrates Cross' base to shut him down; Cassie accepts, and adopts the new codename Stinger.Astonishing Ant-Man #1-6 When Scott learns about her disappearance, he rushes to help her, but ends up captured in her place; however, Cassie manages to get his crew to help him escape. In the end, though, because of Darla's show, they end up discovered by the police; to protect his daughter, Scott takes the blame and claims he kidnapped and forced her to help him. Cassie captures Power Broker shortly after her father's arrest.Astonishing Ant-Man #7-11 When Cassie finally confesses to her mother what she did, Peggy takes her to the trial, where Darren Cross in the Yellowjacket suit and his henchmen (Crossfire and Egghead) burst into the courtroom to get revenge on Scott. Cassie rushes to help her father, and the two make amends during the fight, which ends with Cassie defeating Cross. Cassie's mother is called as the final prosecution witness, but surprisingly she declares that Scott was innocent, as he always looked after Cassie and has always been her hero, admitting that he took the blame for what she did; this allowed Scott to be acquitted. Afterward, Cassie finally receives her mother's blessing as a superhero, and joins her father as a new crimefighting duo.Astonishing Ant-Man #13 Powers and abilities Cassie Lang alongside her gigantic alter ego Stature. From The Astonishing Ant-Man #6. Art by Mark Brooks Cassie Lang has the ability to increase and decrease her size. She can become roughly tall and can shrink to the size of an ant. Her abilities seemed to be fueled by her emotions. She grows when she gets angry and shrinks when she feels guilty. Cassie seems to have become more powerful since first demonstrating her powers, as she has in recent issues surpassed her previous growth limit. At first she struggled to shrink to 6 inches and grow to 10‚Äì15 feet.Young Avengers #2-6 She has been seen growing larger than the Skrull Yellowjacket, who could grow to at least tall.Secret Invasion #7 It was established that she and Hank Pym share an upper limit of somewhere around in height, and that, if she keeps her bigger dimensions for too long, Cassie will suffer from strains that will eventually force her to shrink back down.Mighty Avengers #24-31 As Stinger, she has a helmet similar to that of Ant-Man, which allows her to communicate with and control \\"over five thousands species of ants and insects\\"; she also sports a suit with bio-synthetic wings that allow her to fly, and that can fire bio-electric blasts from the wrists.Astonishing Ant-Man #6-10 Other versions =MC2= Cassie Lang as Stinger from A-Next #1. In MC2, Cassandra Lang is now a doctor and operates under the name Stinger on the group A-Next. Although she is the oldest member of A-Next, in her mid-20s, and the only one on the original team with a professional life and a scientific background, she is still doted on by her father, who constantly worries about her newfound superhero life. She possesses many abilities originally engineered by Henry Pym, including resizing, flying, communication with insects, and firing bioelectric \\"stinger\\" blasts (as well artificial \\"stingers\\" sedative darts), all based on her costume and helmet. She does not seem to be capable of increasing her size and strength, unlike her main continuity version. =Avengers Fairy Tales= In issue 3 of Avengers Fairy Tales, Cassie Lang is portrayed as Alice of Alice in Wonderland. She encounters Wonderland versions of the Young Avengers. At first, her emotions cause her to grow and shrink beyond her control. She also meets Wonderland versions of Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Tigra.Avengers Fairy Tales #3 =What If?= *In the What If story \\"The Leaving\\", which takes place fifty years into an alternate future, Cassandra is a nursemaid for the elderly Scarlet Witch.What If? vol. 1 #38 (1983) *In \\"What If Iron Man Lost the Armor Wars\\", Cassie is taken hostage by Justin Hammer to force Scott Lang's cooperation against his benefactor Tony Stark.

In the film, Scott Lang resorts to burglary to pay for child support to see Cassie again. She is threatened by Yellowjacket in the film's climax after Scott's team were responsible for ruining Darren Cross's business, but she is saved by Ant-Man from Yellowjacket. She is shown to enjoy ugly and terrifying objects such as the stuffed rabbit Scott gave her as a birthday present, and the giant ant Scott accidentally made while fighting Yellowjacket in her room, the latter of whom she keeps as a pet. * Fortson reprises her role in the 2018 sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp. In the film, she spends some time with Scott who is under house arrest, but sometimes she covers her father's back by preventing Jimmy Woo from catching Scott by saying she wants to be a superhero like her father. In the end, it was her first time to shrink like an insect, spending time with her father and Hope van Dyne, as they watch a movie on a laptop as if they were in a drive-in theater. * Emma Fuhrmann portrays a teenage Cassie Lang in Avengers: Endgame. In the film, five years after Thanos's snap (as seen in Avengers: Infinity War), she is seen still living in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, believing her father to have been one of the decimated. Once Scott escapes from the quantum realm, he visits Cassie and they share a tearful reunion together. After Thanos's defeat, she is shown watching the celebration with Scott and Hope together. =Video games= * The character appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel's Avengers as both Stature and the Ant-Man version of Cassie Lang. * Stinger appears as a premium playable character in Marvel Avengers Academy as part of the Young Avengers event. =References in other works= * Cassie Lang is referenced in the mc chris song \\"Nrrrd Grrrl\\": \\"Wanna conquer her like Kang, When you kiss like Cassie Lang.\\"Ward, Chris. \\"Nrrrd Grrrl.\\" Lyrics. mc chris is dead. mc chris LLC, 2008.

It is named after the botanist John Bellenden Ker Gawler. Located south of Cairns near Babinda, it is adjacent to Mount Bartle Frere, the state's highest peak, part of the Bellenden Ker Range which is also known as the Wooroonooran Range. The two mountains dominate the Josephine Falls section of the Wooroonooran National Park. Both peaks are made of resistant granite and are remnants of an escarpment that has been eroded by the Russell and Mulgrave Rivers. Several television transmitter towers have been built on the mountain. The only access to the television transmitter site and the mountain top weather station is by a privately owned cable car. History In 1873, Walter Hill, Queensland's first Colonial botanist, undertook an expedition to northern Queensland to collect native plants and included a trip to Mount Bellenden Ker. In the same year Robert Arthur Johnstone climbed the peak while exploring the coastal lands south of Cooktown with George Elphinstone Dalrymple. Another expedition to the summit, led by Archibald Meston (1851-1924), was conducted in early February to early March 1889.

They released the album Riddles Are Abound Tonight in April 1994 through the Interscope Records imprint Prawn Song Records. Sausage reunited on December 31, 2019 to perform for the first time in 25 years. History =Primus= Primus was formed in 1984 by singer and bassist Les Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth. The two of them played with a number of drummers before eventually settling on Tim \\"Curveball\\" Wright two years later. At this time, Jay Lane was playing with The Uptones, and later the Freaky Executives, for whom Claypool acted as a roadie. Claypool was a huge fan of Lane's, and when Wright left Primus in the summer of 1988, Lane was asked to suggest his replacement. Lane accepted the position himself, as the Freaky Executives were, in Claypool's words, \\"in record company hell. They were somehow getting dicked around by their record company\\". After recording a demo together, which they titled Sausage, Lane left Primus at the end of 1988 when \\"something good happened\\" with the Freaky Executives' record deal. Huth also left shortly after, wishing to dedicate more time to his family as he had just had a son and was expecting another. Claypool continued Primus, replacing Huth and Lane with Larry LaLonde and Tim Alexander, respectively. =Riddles Are Abound Tonight= In 1994, Claypool, Huth, and Lane reunited to record the album Riddles Are Abound Tonight under the name Sausage, inspired by the demo they had recorded together in 1988. The album was released in April 1994 by Prawn Song Records, a vanity label owned by Claypool and subsidiary of Interscope Records, and was supported by a short tour during which the band opened for Helmet and Rollins Band. Track listing Critical reception In his review for Allmusic, Bret Love compared the album to Primus' output favourably in some respects, describing Sausage as \\"a tighter, more focused groove machine\\" with a \\"more accessible sound\\", but also noted that the lack of \\"instrumental virtuosity, strange time signatures, and almost constant left-field changes\\" would likely leave Primus fans generally unsatisfied. Music video Claypool, Lane and Huth in the \\"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\\" video. A music video was made for the title track, \\"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\\", co-directed by Claypool and Mark Kohr and filmed at the Oakland Scottish Rite Clinic for Childhood Language Disorders. It shows the band members playing their instruments in close proximity while each wearing a hooded blue leotard featuring a small lightbulb on the end of an antenna, similar to that of an anglerfish. These tops are then revealed to all be connected at the waist and part of a larger sheet of fabric that stretches out to cover the top of a three-tiered scaffold structure surrounded by various lamps and stage lights. Under the sheet, the band are pedalling stationary bicycles that in turn run a vast series of gears powering the lights. The middle layer of the scaffold structure houses a go-go dancer, and below her a woman in a Victorian dress uses sign language while children in similar attire perform a baroque dance around the structure.

It is blue-green in appearance, depicted as a terrestrial planet with humanoid inhabitants, and characterized by a peaceful culture. It is the home planet of Princess Leia Organa, one of the lead characters in the film series. In the original 1977 film, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star's superlaser. Depiction Early drafts of the Star Wars story include references to at least two planets which later evolved into the concept of Alderaan. Star Wars author George Lucas included a planet called Alderaan in early treatments; in The Star Wars (1973), Alderaan is a city-planet and the capital planet of the galaxy (prefiguring the planet Coruscant which later featured in the films). The draft script opens with a scene in which an \\"eerie blue-green\\" planet called Aquilae is threatened by an armed space fortress. In Lucas's 1975 draft, Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars, the capital planet of Alderaan is described as a floating city in the clouds, \\"suspended in a sea of cirrus methane\\". A planet described in Lucas's draft script as being \\"under siege by the Imperial Legions of Alderaan\\" and which is later destroyed is named as Ogana Major. Early sketches commissioned by Lucas from conceptual illustrator Ralph McQuarrie show a design which very closely resembles Cloud City, as featured in the later sequel, The Empire Strikes Back. In Lucas's third draft, the Imperial City of Alderaan has become the home world of the Sith Lords, and Darth Vader holds Princess Leia captive here. Lucas continued to hone his script, aided by screenwriters Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz; names of planets and characters were revised and the narrative was improved, and by the fourth draft, scenes on the Imperial capital planet had been moved to a space station called the Death Star and the peaceful world destroyed by the Empire had taken the name Alderaan. The on-screen depictions of Alderaan in the Star Wars films are scant; the distant planet is seen momentarily in Star Wars (1977) prior to its destruction, and in Revenge of the Sith (2005) a short scene shows a city amid a snow-covered, mountainous landscape. =Film= Mountain scenery in Grindelwald, Switzerland, used to depict Alderaan Composite image based on a shot of Lake Thun, depicting Alderaan Alderaan was originally featured in the first film, Star Wars, released in 1977. The opening scene depicts the capture of a small spaceship from Alderaan, the Tantive IV, by the Galactic Empire, and introduces the character of Princess Leia Organa, a princess of the Royal House of Alderaan who is played by Carrie Fisher. Alderaan appears in a later scene in the film, but is only shown on-screen in a distant view from space as the Empire's gigantic space station, the Death Star, moves into orbit around the planet. The battle station's commander, the Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders the Death Star's superweapon to be fired at the planet. Alderaan explodes instantly in a ball of fire. It is later shown that the shattered planet has been reduced to a cloud of asteroids as the Millennium Falcon spaceship attempts to visit the planet. The destruction of Alderaan meant that it was not depicted in subsequent Star Wars films until the series of prequel films was produced. The planet made its first on-screen appearance since 1977 in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005), appearing briefly at the end of the film. The adoptive father of Princess Leia, Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) is seen piloting a starship to the planet's surface, which is shown as a mountainous, alpine region covered in snow. Landing his ship in a citadel among the mountains, he brings the newborn Princess Leia into his royal palace. The backdrop for these scenes was created by compositing landscape footage of Grindelwald in Switzerland with CGI images of the city. The planet is not featured in the 2016 film Rogue One, but the character Bail Organa makes an appearance, stating that he will return to Alderaan to wait for his daughter, Leia, to bring the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. This precedes the narrative of the 1977 film, A New Hope.It is assumed he dies when the Death Star destroys the planet. =Television= In an episode of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars entitled \\"Assassin\\", Ahsoka Tano has premonitions of Padm√©'s death on Alderaan. The mercenary Carasynthia \\"Cara\\" Dune, in The Mandalorian, is a former Republican Shock Trooper from Alderaan, according to Moff Gideon. =Comics= The comic series Star Wars: Princess Leia (2015) deals with Princess Leia and Evan (a female rebel pilot also native from Alderaan), rescuing survivors from Alderaan's destruction. It also features a brief flashback to Leia's childhood on the planet and her relationship with her adoptive father Senator Bail Organa. In Star Wars #33 (2017), Leia tells Luke that sometimes she can see Alderaan among the stars as, from certain perspectives in the galaxy, its light has not ceased to emit. =Legends= Alderaan is mentioned frequently and also serves as a location in several works in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the collection of books, comics and other material considered outside official canon, now branded Star Wars Legends. In various stories, Alderaan is presented as the home of the characters Tycho Celchu, and of Ulic Qel Droma who fought in the Great Sith War in 4000 BBY. Radio drama The 1981 NPR/BBC radio drama adaptation of Star Wars features scenes set on Alderaan, in which Princess Leia discusses her mission to acquire the Death Star plans from agents of the Rebel Alliance with her father, Bail Organa (Prestor Organa). In a later scene, she is confronted by the Imperial commander Lord Tion and accused of treason. It is established that Alderaan has a strict policy against weapons. Novels In Michael A. Stackpole's 1998 novel, I, Jedi, Alderaan features as the sanctuary of the Caamasi when their home world of Caamas is devastated by the Galactic Empire. Alderaan is featured in a 1991 role-playing game, Graveyard of Alderaan (part of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game). It describes how, after the Clone Wars, Alderaan's massive war machine was dismantled, and the weapons were placed aboard an armory warship called Another Chance. The ship was programmed to continually jump through hyperspace until called home by the Alderanian Council. Bill Slavicsek, who wrote the game's sourcebook, later drew from it for his edition of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe. Comics In the Dark Horse comic Dark Empire (1991‚Äì1992), New Alderaan is a Rebel Alliance colony planet populated by Alderaanians who were off-world when Alderaan was destroyed. Mon Mothma's daughter lives there.  Description  Alderaan (Core Worlds) illustrated on a map of the fictional Star Wars galaxy In Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of the original film, Alderaan is described as a \\"small green gem of a world\\". The planet appears more substantially in Star Wars reference guides to fictional locations. According to Kevin J. Anderson's The Illustrated Star Wars Universe (1995) and Wallace, Kolins and McKinney's Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons (1998), Alderaan is covered by wild grasslands, plains, forests and mountain ranges. The planet has no ocean, but has a semi-frozen polar sea, and thousands of lakes and rivers. It is rich in biodiversity, populated by a wide variety of flora and fauna, such as the nerf and the thranta. Human life on the planet is evidenced by a number of cities, built to harmonize with the natural environment such as on canyon walls, on stilts along the shoreline or under the polar ice. The capital city, Aldera, has been built on a small island in the center of a caldera. The Alderaanian people value arts and education highly, and place high importance on their participation in the Galactic (later Imperial) Senate and the promotion of peace through demilitarization. The largely democratic society is formed as hereditary constitutional monarchy, ruled by the King or Queen of Alderaan from the Royal House of Antilles and later, due to marriage, the House of Organa. The planetary government is the High Council of Alderaan, presided over by a First Chairman and Viceroy. Cultural analysis The destruction of Alderaan is considered by some as an artistic depiction of the danger of nuclear weapons during the Cold War and some claim it is used as a example of inadequate political and military action leading to negative effects.Ed.

The first recorded permanent white settler in northern Colorado, he founded the town of Laporte in 1858. Biography Janis was born in Missouri to a French father and a mulatto mother. As a young man, in his early years Antoine traveled with his father on trading caravans from Missouri to the Green River. In 1836 he may have traveled with his father on a caravan along the Cache la Poudre River valley in present-day Larimer County. It is possible but not established that the river obtained its name during this trip. In 1844 he journeyed west on his own, working with brother Nicholas as a scout and interpreter out of Fort Laramie, where he married First Elk Woman of the Oglala Sioux tribe. While returning from a trip to Mexico, he passed through present-day Colorado along the Poudre Valley, arriving at the spot where the Poudre emerges from the foothills. He was particularly taken by the valley, calling it \\"the loveliest spot on earth.\\" At the time, the area was not open to settlement but was part of the hunting territory of the Arapaho and Cheyenne. Janis staked out a squatter's claim on the river bottom just west of present-day Laporte, in June 1844; with the expectation of returning to homestead there once it was possible to legally file the claim. Janis with a group of Sioux and Arapaho, 1877. Friday, seated at lower right, often camped with his band along the Poudre River near where Janis staked his claim. The opening up of the western Nebraska Territory to homesteading allowed Janis to return to the area 1858 with his claim filed. He was accompanied by a party of other homesteaders from Fort Laramie, including John B. Provost, his brothers Francis and Nicholas Janis, Antoine LeBeau, Tood Randall, E.W. Raymond, B. Goodman, Laroque Bosquet (aka: Rock Bush) and Oliver Morrisette. His arrival to the area with his wife came one year before the flood of prospectors in the 1859 Colorado Gold Rush. Janis settled in the area with approximately 150 lodges of Arapaho, who accompanied him to the spot. With the other members of his party, he founded the town of Colona, which later became Laporte, the first white community in Larimer County. The following year he erected a small wooden house on the south side of Poudre River where he kept a grocery and saloon. He continued to live in the area until 1878, when a general order from the federal government forced his wife to move to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Janis sold his cabin and accompanied his wife to the reservation, where he died in 1890. In 1939, Janis' wooden homestead cabin was moved from Laporte to its present location adjacent to the Fort Collins Museum and Discovery Science Center in Fort Collins. The cabin is part of the museum grounds open to the public and has been partially restored for tours.

A veteran of the American Revolution, Haynes was the first black man in the United States to be ordained as a minister. Haynes was a native of West Hartford, Connecticut, and was the son of an African American man and a white woman. He spent much of his childhood as an indentured servant in the house of a Granville, Massachusetts farmer. A regular churchgoer, he began to preach as a boy. He served in the militia during the American Revolution, including garrison duty at the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. Haynes also became an anti-slavery activist. In addition to arguing against involuntary servitude and preaching against the slave trade, Haynes also advocated against the colonization movement, arguing that people of African descent living in the United States should be entitled to the same rights as other citizens, and that having them resettle in Africa would not be beneficial. Ordained in the Congregational church in 1785, Haynes pastored a church in Torrington, Connecticut for three years. In 1788, Haynes accepted a call to pastor the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he remained for the next 30 years. He then moved to a temporary pastorate at Manchester, Vermont, and finally to South Granville, New York, where he was pastor of South Granville Congregational Church. Haynes died in South Granville in 1833, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville. Early life and education Haynes was born on July 18, 1753 in West Hartford, Connecticut, reportedly to a Caucasian mother of some status and an unknown man who was African or African-American. The identity of Haynes's mother has long been the subject of debate among historians and theologians. The most prevalent theory is that she was a servant named Lucy or Alice Fitch who worked for the John Haynes family of West Hartford. Another theory suggests that Fitch was a stand-in, willing or unwilling, for his real mother. According to this theory, Haynes's mother was a member of the prominent Goodwin family of Hartford who tried to avoid the scandal associated with giving birth while unmarried by staying with the Haynes family. Both theories suggest that Lucy (or Alice) Fitch was fired by the Haynes family after she attested to or was accused of being the mother. She named her son Haynes, either to give him respectability or to take revenge against the Hayneses for firing her. At the age of five months, Lemuel Haynes was given over to indentured servitude to Deacon David Rose, a blind farmer of Granville, Massachusetts. Part of the indenture required Rose to see to Haynes's education, and by accompanying Rose to church, he became exposed to Calvinistic religious doctrine, including the works of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and Philip Doddridge, who all became strong influences on Haynes' religious outlook.Anyabwile, Thabiti M. The decline of African American theology: from biblical faith to cultural captivity. InterVarsity Press, 2007. pp. 67-68 According to Haynes, while David Rose fulfilled his indenture obligations to Haynes, Rose's wife Elizabeth (Fowler) Haynes (d. 1775) was especially devoted to his upbringing, to the point of treating him as though he was her own child. Military service Freed in 1774 when his indenture expired, Haynes joined the minutemen of Granville. In 1775, he marched with his militia company to Roxbury, Massachusetts, following the news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1776, he accompanied them in the garrisoning of the recently captured Fort Ticonderoga. He remained on garrison duty until contracting Typhus, which caused him to return home. Writings During the American Revolution, Haynes began to write extensively, criticizing the slave trade and slavery. He continued these activities after the war, and also began to prepare sermons, family prayers and other theological works. The Scripture, abolitionism, and republicanism affected his published writings, in which Haynes argued that slavery denied black people their natural rights to \\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\". Paralleling the recent American experience with oppression to the slave experience, Haynes wrote: \\"Liberty is equally as precious to a black man, as it is to a white one, and bondage as equally as intolerable to the one as it is to the other\\". Ministry Haynes' last home, in South Granville, now a National Historic Landmark After his militia service, Haynes studied theology with members of the clergy in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He received his license to preach in 1780, along with a position as temporary 'supply' to his home congregation in Middle Granville. About the same time, he began his many years of service as a missionary in the wilderness of the New Hampshire Grants, soon to be known as the independent Vermont Republic and finally the American state of Vermont. Haynes was ordained in 1785 and settled at Hemlock Congregational Church in Torrington, Connecticut. He was the first African American ordained in the United States. On March 28, 1788, Haynes left his pastorate at Torrington to accept a call at the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now West Rutland's United Church of Christ), where he led the mostly white congregation for 30 years. Haynes continued to write and speak about slavery. His contemporary white republican and abolitionist thinkers did see slavery as a liability to the new country, but most argued for eventual slave expatriation to Africa. The American Colonization Society (founded in 1817) was the largest colonization group. Included among its supporters were people such as James Madison, James Monroe, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. The ACS was strongly supported in Vermont. In contrast, Haynes continued to passionately argue along Calvinist lines that God's providential plan would defeat slavery and lead to the harmonious integration of the races as equals. After asking for and accepting dismissal from West Rutland in 1818, he took a temporary post at Manchester.Cooley, p. 209 His final pastorate was in South Granville, New York where he was minister of the South Granville Congregational Church from 1822 to 1833.Cooley, p. 253 Death and burial Haynes died in South Granville, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville. He had composed his own epitaph, which was included on his gravestone as he had requested. Family While living in Middle Granville in the early 1780s, Haynes met and married Elizabeth Babbitt (1763-1836), a white schoolteacher. Their children included: i. Elizabeth (b. November 1785 Granville, Mass, 6 Sep 1866 Rutland) ii. Eunice (b. 3 March 1789 Rutland, d. 2 January 1859 Granville, New York) iii. Louis (b. 1790 Rutland, d. 12 January 1828 Granville, New York) iv.

PLRU usually refers to two cache replacement algorithms: tree-PLRU and bit-PLRU. Tree-PLRU Tree-PLRU is an efficient algorithm to select an item that most likely has not been accessed very recently, given a set of items and a sequence of access events to the items. This technique is used in the CPU cache of the Intel 486 and in many processors in the PowerPC family, such as Freescale's PowerPC G4 used by Apple Computer. The algorithm works as follows: consider a binary search tree for the items in question. Each node of the tree has a one-bit flag denoting \\"go left to find a pseudo-LRU element\\" or \\"go right to find a pseudo-LRU element\\". To find a pseudo-LRU element, traverse the tree according to the values of the flags. To update the tree with an access to an item N, traverse the tree to find N and, during the traversal, set the node flags to denote the direction that is opposite to the direction taken. Pseudo LRU workingThis algorithm can be sub-optimal since it is an approximation. For example, in the above diagram with A, C, B, D cache lines, if the access pattern was: C, B, D, A, on an eviction we would chose B instead of C. This is because both A and C are in the same half and accessing A directs the algorithm to the other half that does not contain cache line C. Bit-PLRU Bit-PLRU stores one status bit for each cache line. These bits are called MRU-bits. Every access to a line sets its MRU-bit to 1, indicating that the line was recently used. Whenever the last remaining 0 bit of a set's status bits is set to 1, all other bits are reset to 0. At cache misses, the leftmost line whose MRU-bit is 0 is replaced.

Linola was developed in the early 1990s by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It was developed and released in Australia in 1992 and first commercially grown in 1994.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 Australian Linola varieties are named after Australian lakes. Genesis This variety was developed to provide a source of edible linseed oil with a low alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content of approximately 2%, as compared to 50% in the wild type variety. It was done to improve the storage quality of linseed when used as a bulk livestock feed. Linseed's previous main use had been linseed oil for use as a paint ingredient, with the ALA (omega-3 fatty acid) being a quick drying component. With the advent of \\"plastic\\" water-based paints, the linseed market fell into decline, but when marketed as a stock feed, the omega-3 content also deteriorated quickly in storage. Compared to normal linseed, linola has a lower level of ALA, which increases the oxidative stability of the oil/seed, which means it remains edible much longer when stored. Linola has a correspondingly higher content of the linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acid, around 65% to 75%. The seed colour was also changed from the wild type dark brown seed to a light yellow seed, which consequently gives an oil of a light colour, easily distinguished from the darker linseed oil.  Health Claims  Linola oil likely has the same functional food and health benefits as linseed oil. Linola is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ~~Linola can specially help against neurodermatitis.~~ (No published scientific evidence was found to support this claim.)  Agricultural Distribution  Linola substitutes for flax in cropping rotations; it is claimed to have lower production costs than canola, but brings prices comparable to canola or other edible oils. Linola is produced in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and in the U.S. states of Washington and Idaho. All Canadian cultivars of Linola were deregistered for sale and use as of August 1st, 2013.

Early life  Matenopoulos was born in Richmond, Virginia, of Greek ancestry. She is the daughter of Efrosini, a hair stylist, and Nicolaos T. Matenopoulos, a furniture maker, She also has an older sister, Maria, and older brother, Ike. Her birth name is Thespina Matenopoulos, named after her grandmother. Thespina was later anglicized to Debbie. Matenopoulos went to John Randolph Tucker High School, and then attended Virginia Commonwealth University for one year before transferring to the Journalism Department at New York University. She was a member of the women's fraternity Alpha Omicron Pi. While at NYU she also worked at MTV as an intern. She quickly moved up the ranks, soon becoming story coordinator for UnFiltered.  TV career  In 1997, Matenopoulos was an MTV production assistant\\"The View dumps young co-host\\". Associated Press via the Ottawa Sun, January 8, 1999: 34. and, after a chance meeting with Barbara Walters was invited to audition and was cast, at age 22, as the youngest co-host on Walters's new talk show, The View. She was parodied on Saturday Night Live by Ana Gasteyer, Claire Danes, Cameron Diaz, and Sarah Michelle Gellar as being an uninformed ditz and eventually invited to appear on SNL as a guest, where she played herself. In January 1999, her contract with the show was not renewed, and she was replaced by Lisa Ling. Later that same year, she joined the TV Guide Channel as one of their first on-air hosts. Matenopoulos starred in the claymation show Celebrity Deathmatch as herself. In January 2004, Good Day Live brought in Matenopoulous (along with Arthel Neville) to co-host the nationally syndicated program. On September 29, 2004, she was hospitalized for an injury that was the result of a stunt she attempted for a segment of Good Day Live. The segment was focused on firefighter training, in which she practiced a fall from a three-story building at a Los Angeles fire station. She landed incorrectly on an airbag and was rushed to the hospital for a possible head injury. It was a closed head wound and she was temporarily blind. Despite massive promotion, including a mall-tour featuring Matenopoulous and Arthel Neville, Good Day Live was canceled by its syndicators in March 2005. In January 2006, Matenopoulos joined E!'s coverage of the Golden Globe Awards. In April of that same year, she became one of the three hosts on E!'s weeknight celebrity gossip and pop culture series, The Daily 10, a position she held until August 2009. While at E!, Debbie also hosted Fashion Police, Live from the Red Carpet, and the Style Network's Instant Beauty Pageant. On July 25, 2006, over seven years after her last appearance on The View, she was invited back as a special guest co-host for a day, the first of many subsequent guest appearances she has made on the show over the years. Matenopoulos has also been a frequent contributor to VH1 specials, including I Love the 90s and I Love Toys. She has also been a guest judge on RuPaul's Drag Race 3. Debbie's first critically acclaimed and bestselling cookbook, It‚Äôs All Greek to Me, was initially released in the Spring of 2014. Calling the book her love letter to her family's native Greece, Debbie journeyed to Greece to write and photograph the book and is proud to share her family's favorite classic Greek recipes right from their own kitchens. A revised paperback edition was released in 2018. On July 6, 2015, Matenopoulos was named the co-host of The Insider, a position she held until the show's cancellation on September 9, 2017. Debbie was subsequently named as a Special Correspondent for Entertainment Tonight. In 2016, while still co-host of The Insider, Matenopoulos became co-host of The Home and Family Show, replacing Cristina Ferrare.  Personal life  On July 5, 2003, Matenopoulos married Jay Faires, the president of Music at Lions Gate Entertainment and founder of Mammoth Records.

The Via Cassia was an important Roman road striking out of the Via Flaminia near the Milvian Bridge in the immediate vicinity of Rome and, passing not far from Veii, traversed Etruria. The Via Cassia passed through Baccanae, Sutrium, Volsinii, Clusium, Arretium, Florentia, Pistoria, and Luca, joining the Via Aurelia at Luna. The Via Cassia intersected other important roads. At mile 11 the Via Clodia diverged north- north-west. At Sette Vene, another road, probably the Via Annia, branched off to Falerii. In Sutrium, the Via Ciminia split off and later rejoined. The date of its construction is uncertain: it cannot have been earlier than 187 BC, when the consul Gaius Flaminius constructed a road from Bononia to Arretium, which must have coincided with a portion of the later Via Cassia. It is not mentioned by any ancient authorities before the time of Cicero, who in 45 BC speaks of the existence of three roads from Rome to Mutina: the Flaminia, the Aurelia and the Cassia. A milestone of AD 124 mentions repairs to the road made by Hadrian from the boundary of the territory of Clusium to Florentia, a distance of . Via Amerina The Via Amerina was a road that broke off from the Via Cassia near Baccanae, and held north through Falerii, Tuder, and Perusia, rejoining the Via Cassia at Clusium. When the incursions of Faroald, the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, cut the Via Flaminia, the lifeline between Rome and Ravenna, the Via Amerina was improved and fortified at intervals, works that represented some of the last road-building carried out in Italy in Late Antiquity.

It is endemic to New South Wales in Australia and is the floral emblem of that state. No subspecies are recognised, but the closely related Telopea aspera was only recently classified as a separate species. T. speciosissima is a shrub to high and wide, with dark green leaves. Its several stems arise from a pronounced woody base known as a lignotuber. The species is well renowned for its striking large red springtime inflorescences (flowerheads), each including hundreds of individual flowers. These are visited by the eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), birds such as honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and various insects. The floral emblem for its home state of New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has featured prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T. oreades and T. mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.  Description  alt=Several open banana-shaped seedpods hang down from an old flower spike. Within them a few beige seeds are still attached. Telopea speciosissima, the New South Wales waratah, is a large, erect shrub up to in height with one or more stems. Arising vertically or near vertically from a large woody base, or lignotuber, the stems are little branched. In late spring, there is a spurt of new growth after flowering, with new shoots often arising from old flowerheads. The dark green leaves are alternate and usually coarsely-toothed, ranging from in length. Enveloped in leafy bracts, the flowerheads develop over the winter and begin to swell in early spring,Nixon, p. 23. before opening to reveal the striking inflorescences. The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas.Nixon, p. 27. Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn.Nixon, p. 24. Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure in diameter. They are cupped in a whorl of leafy bracts which are long and also red. Variations are not uncommon; some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome- shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red. The tips of the stigmas of some inflorescences may be whitish, contrasting with the red colour of the rest of the flowerhead.Nixon, p. 25. An individual flowerhead reaches full size about two weeks after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another two weeks before the flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened‚Äîand the flowerhead retains a compact shape‚Äîbefore they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma at the end of the style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore. The seed pods grow to long. As the pods mature, they range from green, to yellow and finally turn russet red-brown. The pods become leathery before splitting open during early winter,. The pods contain winged seeds inside. In the wild, only two or three seed pods develop per flowerhead, but there may be anywhere from 5 to 50 in cultivated plants.  Taxonomy  Hand-coloured engraving of Telopea speciosissima by alt=An old colour drawing of a single red flowerhead on a stem Telopea speciosissima, the New South Wales Waratah, was first described by botanist James Edward Smith in his 1793 book A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland, from \\"very fine dried specimens sent by Mr. White\\". He gave the species its original binomial name of Embothrium speciosissimum. The specific epithet is derived from the superlative of the Latin word speciosus \\"beautiful\\" or \\"handsome\\", hence \\"very-\\" or \\"most beautiful\\". Embothrium had been a wastebasket taxon at the time, and Robert Brown suggested the genus Telopea for it in 1809, which was published in 1810. Richard Salisbury had published the name Hylogyne speciosa in 1809, but Brown's name was nomenclaturally conserved. Telopea speciosissima is one of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. Its closest relative is the very similar Gibraltar Range waratah (T. aspera) from northern New South Wales, which was only recognised as a separate species in 1995, having previously been considered an unusual northern population of T. speciosissima. The genus is classified in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the tree waratahs (Alloxylon) from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance must predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago.Nixon, p. 19. Although no subspecies are recognised within Telopea speciosissima itself, geographical variations within its range have been noted. Forms toward the northern limits of its range have more prominently lobed leaves. A population from Waterfall has darker red, wider inflorescences, and a population at West Head in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park has paler inflorescences. Leaf shape varies widely. The common name waratah was first applied to this species before being generalised to other members of the genus Telopea and, to a lesser extent, Alloxylon. Waratah is derived from the Eora Aboriginal people, the original inhabitants of the Sydney area. The Dharawal people of the Illawarra region knew it as mooloone, and mewah is another aboriginal name. A former common name from around 1900 is \\"native tulip\\", possibly derived from Telopea.  Distribution and habitat  Distribution of Telopea speciosissima (highlighted in red) within Australia The species is found in New South Wales (Australia) from the Watagan Mountains southward to Ulladulla, with a relatively widespread distribution in the Central Coast region. It usually occurs as an understory shrub in open forest on sandy soils in areas with moderately high rainfall, receiving on average around a year.Nixon, p. 40. Dappled shade from eucalyptus (Eucalyptus) trees reduces sunlight by around 30%. Much of its range occurs in the Sydney Basin, an area with one of the highest human populations and most intense development in Australia. The impact of habitat fragmentation and decreased fire interval (time between bushfires) on the gene pool of Telopea speciosissima, which relies on outcrossing, is unclear. Although largely protected within National Parks and conservation reserves in the Sydney area, most populations are small, numbering under 200 plants, and are often located near urban developments.  Ecology  alt=A shrub with a brilliant red flowerhead growing above grass among gum trees with blackened trunks from a bushfire Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-flowering species, relying on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, it is one of the slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests.Nixon, pp. 25‚Äì26. Flowering may be prolific at this time. Fully mature flowerheads with opened florets, like this specimen from the alt=A red dome-shaped flowerhead made up of hundreds of red flowers in late afternoon sun in bushland The prominent position and striking colour of Telopea speciosissima and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae both in Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years.Nixon, p. 19. Honeyeaters, in particular the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the crescent honeyeater (P. pyrrhopterus),Nixon, plate 3. are frequent visitors. However, a field study conducted at Barren Grounds showed New Holland honeyeaters to carry relatively little pollen. The eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus) also forages among the flowerheads. The New South Wales waratah had been considered to be protandrous (that is, with male parts concluding sexual activity before female parts become receptive on the same plant), but analysis of the timing of pollen viability and stigma receptivity has shown significant overlaps. The species has been shown to be self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with plants of other genotypes to reproduce successfully.  Cultivation  alt=two green bushes growing in a garden bed next to a driveway The New South Wales waratah was a popular garden plant at the beginning of the 20th century. It had been introduced early (1789) into the United Kingdom, and was reported flowering for the first time in 1809 at Springwell, the villa of one E. J. A. Woodford Esq. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded it an Award of Merit in 1914, and a First Class Certificate in 1922. Initially, waratahs were picked from the bushland for market, but by the early 20th century, a few plantsmen grew concerned at the development of urban areas at the expense of bush, particularly areas noted for wildflowers. Percy Parry of Floralands in Kariong developed the idea of \\"Preservation by Cultivation\\" and investigated the commercial cultivation of waratahs and other native plants. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Government was looking to curb flower and plant collecting from the wild, and considered prohibition in 1944, but after witnessing the ability of Parry to manage and develop cultivation, introduced compulsory licences for wildflower collecting the following year. With his wife Olive, Percy promoted and developed knowledge over fifty years and received the Order of Australia medal in 1981.Nixon, p. 41. Following on from the Parrys were Howard Gay and Arch Dennis, who pioneered growing waratahs at Monbulk in the Dandenong Ranges in the 1940s, Sid Cadwell and Frank Stone, who did likewise in Dural and the Blue Mountains respectively.Nixon, p. 42. The growing movement for cultivating and preserving native plants led to the establishment of the Society for Growing Australian Plants in 1957, and the waratah was featured heavily in the first edition of its journal Australian Plants. Today, New South Wales waratahs are grown commercially in Australia north of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, where they have been grown since 1961. One major challenge in commercial production is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water. Although they grow naturally on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates the plants and promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds.Nixon, p. 58. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to- type. Several species of fungi infect the roots of waratahs, causing significant plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part or all of the plant, or lack of proteoid roots.Nixon, p. 56. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi,Nixon, p. 57. which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi are less likely to be the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions. The larvae of the Macadamia leafminer (Acrocercops chionosema), a moth, burrow along and disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly a problem in lowering the value of cut flower crops. More problematic is the larger caterpillar of another moth, the Macadamia twig girdler Macadamia twig girdler (Xylorycta luteotactella) which can burrow into and disfigure the developing flowerhead. = Cultivars = alt=A pale pink flowerhead made up of hundreds of pinkish flowers still a little greenish in the centre is nestled among its bracts and leaves. A number of natural variants of Telopea speciosissima have been selected for cultivation as follows: * Telopea 'Brimstone Blush' is a shrub of smaller size than the species, reaching a metre (3 ft) tall, and was originally found growing on a property of Ben Richards in Oakdale, southwest of Sydney. Flowering takes place in October. The flowerhead is globular with a pink crown and has 160 individual flowers, the styles of which are pink and white towards the ends. Three rows of whorled dark red bracts surround the flowerheads.Nixon, p. 33. * Telopea 'Cardinal' is a form originally found on the property of Lucille Pope in Werombi, from where it was propagated and made available commercially. The original plant was a vigorous specimen reaching and producing 100 to 120 flowerheads each year. It is named for its large dome-shaped cardinal red flowerheads, which bear 210 individual flowers and are surrounded by two rows of dark red bracts. These blooms have long vase life.Nixon, pp. 33‚Äì34. * Telopea 'Corroboree', a form with longer styles, has compact inflorescences measuring high and wide, and is a vigorous grower. It was selected for commercial propagation in 1974 by Nanette Cuming of Bittern, Victoria, and registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1989. It is grown principally for the cut flower industry. * Telopea 'Fire and Brimstone' is a vigorous form with large inflorescences selected by waratah grower and author Paul Nixon of Camden, New South Wales. It is a shrub which may reach 3‚Äì4 m tall and 2 m wide, with large leaves with more heavily toothed margins. Each flowerhead is cone-shaped and has up to 240 florets. The stigmas are a light red and tipped with white. The bracts surrounding the flowerheads are relatively small, while the leaves are large and can reach in length.Nixon, p. 34. The cultivar is thought to be tetraploid. With a long vase life of 17 days, the cultivar is suitable for the cut flower industry. * Telopea 'Galaxy' has flowerheads with pinkish red tepals and white tips to the styles, surrounded by large bracts. * Telopea 'Olympic Flame' is a form with prominent bracts around the flowerheads. It has large leaves with toothed margins and flowers in early spring. Also known as 'Sunburst', it arose as a seedling in a breeding program conducted by Cathy Offord, Peter Goodwin and Paul Nixon under the auspices of the University of Sydney. * Telopea 'Parry's Dream' was a chance seedling in the early 1970s. It gave rise to this cultivar, a vigorous plant with red-pink flowerheads which reach a diameter of surrounded by pink bracts. * Telopea 'Shade of Pale' is an unusual pale-pink flowered form of T. speciosissima. It is less vigorous than the parent plant. It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in a registered cultivar name. * Telopea 'Sunflare' is an early-flowering form. It has large leaves with toothed margins and flowers in early spring. It also arose as a seedling in the same breeding program by the University of Sydney mentioned above. Selected in 1981, it has red flowerheads with white-tipped styles which reach in diameter. alt=an overhead closeup view of a waratah flowerhead, this time a greenish white in colour * Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' is a white form from Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but none had been previously preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant.Nixon, p. 38. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which grew on water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the Macadamia twig girdler. In addition, a number of interspecific Telopea hybrids have also been produced. These have been bred or used as more frost- or shade-tolerant plants in cooler climates such as Canberra, Melbourne or elsewhere. * Telopea 'Braidwood Brilliant' is a frost- tolerant hybrid between a male T. speciosissima and female T. mongaensis. Dr Boden of the Canberra Parks Administration began investigating this hybrid in 1962, and it was registered in 1975 by Richard Powell. It is a lignotuberous shrub to high and has oblanceolate leaves to long. The red blooms are in diameter, intermediate in size between the parent species. It has grown well in cooler climates such as Canberra.Nixon, p. 32. alt=a red flowerhead nestled among green foliage in a park setting * Telopea 'Canberry Coronet' is a cross between T. speciosissima from Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains and T. mongaensis intended for increased cold tolerance. It has red flowerheads to in diameter. Reaching high, it is a larger plant than 'Braidwood Brilliant'. It was bred by Doug Verdon of the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra. * Telopea 'Champagne' is a cultivar registered under Plant Breeders Rights (PBR) in 2006. Its creamy yellow flowerheads appear from October to December. It is a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. * Telopea 'Golden Globe' is a cultivar registered under PBR in 2006. Larger than 'Champagne', it is also a three-way hybrid between T. speciosissima, T. oreades and the yellow-flowered form of T. truncata. It has been propagated and sold as 'Shady Lady Yellow'. It was originally bred in the Dandenongs east of Melbourne. * Telopea 'Shady Lady' is a larger shrub which may reach high and wide. A hybrid of T. speciosissima and T. oreades, it arose by chance in a Melbourne garden. The flowerheads are smaller and lack the bracts of the speciosissima parent. As its name suggests, it tolerates more shade. It is vigorous and more reliable in temperate and subtropical areas, and grows in semi-shade or sun. 'Shady Lady Crimson', 'Shady Lady Red' and 'Shady Lady Pink' are three selected commercially available colour forms. * Telopea 'Shady Lady White' is a white hybrid between T. speciosissima and T. oreades.  Symbolic and artistic references  Waratah - Lucien Henry, 1887 Drummoyne. An early 20th century work, it depicts Australian native flowers, the red waratah, emblem of the state of New South Wales; flannel flowers, Christmas bells and wattle (Acacia). The inscription reads \\"The heavens declare the glory of God. The firmament showeth his handiwork\\"alt=a small round stained glass window surrounded by twelve panels featuring floral designs of large red and small white flowers The New South Wales waratah featured prominently in the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest.Nice, p. 6. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She fell in love with a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah.Nixon, pp. 15‚Äì16. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering. The striking form of the New South Wales waratah became a popular motif in Australian art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and was incorporated in art nouveau designs of the time. Matchboxes, paperweights and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. Arnott's often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s.Nice, p. 54. Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in Broken Hill, also displayed it on their label. The French artist Lucien Henry, who had settled in Sydney in 1879, was a strong proponent of a definitive Australian art style incorporating local flora, particularly the waratah.Nice, p. 20. His most famous surviving work is a triptych stained glass window of Oceania flanked by numerous waratahs overlooking the Centennial Hall in Sydney Town Hall. In 1925, artist Margaret Preston produced a hand-coloured woodcut depicting waratahs. The species also appeared on an Australian 3 shilling stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968. The Sydney suburb of Telopea takes its name from the Waratah, as does the Newcastle suburb of Waratah and the Super Rugby team, the Sydney-based NSW Waratahs. After Australian federation in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle Acacia pycnantha, and debate raged between proponents of the two flowers. The economist and botanist R. T. Baker proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence of its flowers.Nixon, p. 85. He was nicknamed the \\"Commander in Chief of the Waratah Armed Forces\\".Nice, p. 30. The South Australian Evening News also supported the bid, but to no avail. Decades later, in 1962, Telopea speciosissima was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of New South Wales by the then-governor Sir Eric Woodward, after being used informally for many years.Nixon, p. 86. The species has also been adopted by others, including the New South Wales Waratahs rugby union team since the 1880s, and the former department store Grace Bros in a stylised form for their logo in the 1980s. Contemporary clothing designers Jenny Kee and Linda Jackson produced waratah-inspired fabric designs in the 1970s and 1980s during a resurgence of Australian motifs.Nice, p. 56. From 1956 the annual Waratah Festival was held in Sydney, run by the Sydney Committee. It took place from late October to early November, coinciding with the blooming of the waratahs. It was an important cultural event which included a parade, a popular art competition, beauty contests, exhibitions and performances.The Australian, Triumph of the Artificial, 02-08-2008 A highlight was the Lord Mayor's reception at the Sydney Town Hall for which the floral displays were made of hundreds of waratahs culled by Park Rangers from the national parks. In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, Nathan Rees, commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales Waratah.

The United States of Africa is a hypothetical concept of a federation of some or all of the 54 sovereign states and two disputed states on the continent of Africa. The concept takes its origin from Marcus Garvey's 1924 poem \\"Hail, United States of Africa\\". Origins Marcus Garvey in 1924 The idea of a multinational unifying African state has been compared to various medieval African empires, including the Ethiopian Empire, the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire, the Benin Empire, the Kanem Empire, and other historic nation states.Would a United States of Africa work?, from Le Monde diplomatique (English edition), September 2000 During the late 19th and early 20th century the majority of African land was controlled by various European empires, with the British controlling around 30 per cent of the African population at its peak. The term \\"United States of Africa\\" was mentioned first by Marcus Garvey in his poem Hail, United States of Africa in 1924. Garvey's ideas and formation systems deeply influenced former Africa leaders and the rebirth of the African Union. =2009‚Äì11 proposals= Muammar al-Gaddafi in 2003 In February 2009, upon being elected chairman of the 53-nation African Union in Ethiopia, Gaddafi told the assembled African leaders: \\"I shall continue to insist that our sovereign countries work to achieve the United States of Africa.\\" The BBC reported that Gaddafi had proposed \\"a single African military force, a single currency and a single passport for Africans to move freely around the continent\\". Other African leaders stated they would study the proposal's implications, and re-discuss it in May 2009.AU summit extended amid divisions, from BBC News, 4 February 2009 The focus for developing the United States of Africa so far has been on building subdivisions of Africa - the proposed East African Federation can be seen as an example of this. Former President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, had indicated that the United States of Africa could exist as early as 2017. The African Union, by contrast, has set itself the task of building a \\"united and integrated\\" Africa by 2025.United States of Africa - A Wishful Thinking , from AfricaLoft, republished 4 February 2009 Gaddafi had also indicated that the proposed federation may extend as far west as the Caribbean: Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other islands featuring a large African diaspora, may be invited to join.United States of Africa may take off in 2017, says Wade , from Guardian Newspapers, published 13 February 2009 Gaddafi also received criticism for his involvement in the movement, and lack of support for the idea from among other African leaders.Gadhafi pledges 'United States of Africa', from NBC News, 2 February 2009 A week before Gaddafi's death during the Libyan Civil War, South African President Jacob Zuma expressed relief at the regime's downfall, complaining that Gaddafi had been \\"intimidating\\" many African heads of state and government in an effort to gain influence throughout the continent and suggesting that the African Union will function better without Gaddafi and his repeated proposals for a unitary African government. =After the death of Gaddafi= Gaddafi was ultimately killed during the Battle of Sirte in October 2011. While some regard the project to have died with him, Robert Mugabe expressed interest in reviving the project. Following the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'√©tat, Mugabe resigned as President. On 6 September 2019, Mugabe died. National views The nations of Eritrea, Ghana, Senegal, and Zimbabwe, have supported an African federation. Others such as South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria have been more skeptical, feeling that the continent is not ready for integration. North African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, and post-revolution Libya who have traditionally identified more with rival ideologies like Arab nationalism, Berberism and Islamism have shown less interest in the idea. Support appears to be inversely proportional to a nation's power and influence. Doubts have been raised about whether the goal of a unified Africa can ever be achieved while ongoing problems of conflict and poverty persist throughout the continent.'United States of Africa' Still an Idea Ahead of Its Time, from World Politics Review, 13 July 2007 Demographics The proposed federation would have the largest total territory of any state, exceeding the Russian Federation. It would also be the third most populous state after China and India, and with a population speaking an estimated 2,000 languages. In fiction In the fictional Star Trek universe, the United States of Africa exist as part of the United Earth Government. Commander Uhura and Lieutenant Commander La Forge originate from Kenya and Somalia respectively, both within the United States of Africa. In the fictional Halo universe, the United States of Africa exist as a nation of the United Earth Government, within the United Nations Space Command. Arthur C. Clarke's 1987 science fiction novel 2061: Odyssey Three features the formation of a United States of Southern Africa.

The distance this zone extends from the firefront is highly dependent on terrain, windspeed, fuel type and composition, relative humidity and ambient temperature, and can range from under 100 m to well over 1 km. Project Vesta The term dead man zone was coined by members of the CSIRO research team in Australia who were investigating the spread of bushfires (Project Vesta). Project Vesta, headed by scientist Phil Cheney, found that when the wind changes direction, the line of fire will move out at its maximum rate of spread almost immediately, and that that speed was nearly three times what was previously thought. Project Vesta's research into bushfire behaviour makes up the majority of what is known about bushfires today.  Outcomes  Outcomes from Project Vesta have been integrated into firefighter training in Australia, and are beginning to appear in the United States. Firefighters try to stay out of the dead man zone at all times, working from safe points such as burnt ground or a large area of non-burnable ground, such as a cricket or Australian rules football oval, or a large car park. This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. (Were they to attack fires at the head of the fire, they risk having spot fires start behind them. They would also risk changes in wind behaviour accelerating the spread of the fire.) The result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone, and that they should always keep 250 litres of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.

The axis of rotation is tilted by the magic angle Œ∏m with respect to the direction of B0. In nuclear magnetic resonance, magic-angle spinning (MAS) is a technique often used to perform experiments in solid-state NMR spectroscopy and, more recently, liquid Proton nuclear magnetic resonance. () () By spinning the sample (usually at a frequency of 1 to 130 kHz) at the magic angle Œ∏m (ca. 54.74¬∞, where cos2Œ∏m=1/3) with respect to the direction of the magnetic field, the normally broad lines become narrower, increasing the resolution for better identification and analysis of the spectrum. In any condensed phase, a nuclear spin experiences a great number of interactions. The main three interactions (dipolar, chemical shift anisotropy, quadrupolar) often lead to very broad and featureless lines. However, these three interactions in solids are orientation-dependent and can be averaged by MAS. The nuclear dipole-dipole interaction, between magnetic moments of nuclei averages to zero only at the magic angle, Œ∏m . The chemical shift anisotropy, a nuclear-electron interaction, averages to a non-zero value. The quadrupolar interaction is only partially averaged by MAS leaving a residual secondary quadrupolar interaction. In liquids, e.g. a solution of an organic compound, most of these interactions will average out because of the rapid time-averaged molecular motion that occurs. This orientation averaging in solution is mimicked by MAS of a solid. This causes the signal to become much narrower, giving rise to the isotropic value (which is of interest for structural determination of solid materials and compounds) and spinning sidebands which occur at multiples of the spinning speed and can be used to determine the chemical shift anisotropy of the nuclei. The physical spinning of the sample is achieved via an air turbine mechanism. These turbines (or rotors) come in a variety of diameters (outside diameter), from 0.70‚Äì15.0 mm, and are usually spun on air or nitrogen gas. The rotors are made from a number of different materials such as ceramics e.g. zirconia, silicon nitride or polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyoxymethylene (POM). The cylindrical rotors are axially symmetric about the axis of rotation. Samples are packed into the rotors and these are then sealed with a single or double end cap. These caps are made from number of different materials e.g. Kel-F, Vespel, zirconia or boron nitride depending on the application required. Magic-angle spinning was first described in 1958 by Edward Raymond Andrew, A. Bradbury, and R. G. Eades and independently in 1959 by I. J. Lowe. The name \\"magic-angle spinning\\" was coined in 1960 by Cornelis J. Gorter at the AMPERE congress in Pisa. Variations =High Resolution Magic-Angle Spinning (HR- MAS)= HRMAS is usually applied to solutions and gels where there is some internal molecular motion, but the dipole-dipole interactions are insufficiently averaged by such motion. Under these conditions, HRMAS can dramatically average out the dipole-dipole broadening and result in spectra similar to high resolution NMR. This permits the kind of quantitative analysis of components practiced in solution NMR, e.g. =Cross Polarization Magic- Angle Spinning (CP-MAS)= By combining cross polarization with MAS, high resolution spectra can be obtained for rigid solids. =Solution Magic Angle Spinning= Use of Magic Angle Spinning has been extended from solid-state to liquid (solution) NMR.

It is the junction between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. It is a plane synovial joint. Structure =Ligaments= The joint is stabilized by three ligaments: * The acromioclavicular ligament, which attaches the clavicle to the acromion of the scapula. Superior Acromioclavicular Ligament This ligament is a quadrilateral band, covering the superior part of the articulation, and extending between the upper part of the lateral end of the clavicle and the adjoining part of the upper surface of the acromion. It is composed of parallel fibers, which interlace with the aponeuroses of the Trapezius and Deltoideus; below, it is in contact with the articular disk when this is present. Inferior Acromioclavicular Ligament This ligament is somewhat thinner than the preceding; it covers the under part of the articulation, and is attached to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones. It is in relation, above, in rare cases with the articular disk; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus * The coracoacromial ligament, which runs from the coracoid process to the acromion. The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong triangular band, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. It is attached, by its apex, to the summit of the acromion just in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its broad base to the whole length of the lateral border of the coracoid process. This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms a vault for the protection of the head of the humerus. It is in relation, above, with the clavicle and under surface of the Deltoideus; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus, a bursa being interposed. Its lateral border is continuous with a dense lamina that passes beneath the Deltoideus upon the tendons of the Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus. The ligament is sometimes described as consisting of two marginal bands and a thinner intervening portion, the two bands being attached respectively to the apex and the base of the coracoid process, and joining together at the acromion. When the Pectoralis minor is inserted, as occasionally is the case, into the capsule of the shoulder-joint instead of into the coracoid process, it passes between these two bands, and the intervening portion of the ligament is then deficient. * The coracoclavicular ligament, which consists of two ligaments, the conoid and the trapezoid ligaments. The Coracoclavicular Ligament serves to connect the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula. It does not properly belong to the acromioclavicular joint articulation, but is usually described with it, since it forms a most efficient means of retaining the clavicle in contact with the acromion. It consists of two fasciculi, called the trapezoid ligament and conoid ligament. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius and Deltoideus; behind, with the Trapezius. =Variation= An X-ray study of 100 shoulders in US soldiers found considerable variation in the size and shape of the joint.URIST, M. R. (1946). COMPLETE DISLOCATIONS OF THE ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT: The Nature of the Traumatic Lesion and Effective Methods of Treatment with an Analysis of Forty-One Cases. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am.28: 813 - 837. The articular surfaces were notably different in size and form. On some they are separated by a meniscus attached to the superior acromioclavicular ligament. This meniscus may be a blade of fibrocartilage that extends nearly halfway into the joint or it may form a complete disc that divides the joint into two parts. In other joints no synovial joint is present with the joint being made by a pad of fibrous tissue attached to the outer end of the clavicle, and no articular cavity. Function The acromioclavicular joint provides the ability to raise the arm above the head. This joint functions as a pivot point (although technically it is a gliding synovial joint), acting like a strut to help with movement of the scapula resulting in a greater degree of arm rotation. Clinical significance =Injury= A common injury to the AC joint is dislocation, often called AC separation or shoulder separation. This is not the same as a \\"shoulder dislocation,\\" which refers to dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Acromioclavicular joint dislocation is particularly common in collision sports such as ice hockey, football, Judo, rugby and Aussie rules, and is also a problem for those who participate in swimming, horseback riding, mountain biking, biking, snow skiing and skateboarding. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on the tip of the shoulder or FOOSH (Fall On OutStretched Hand). Acromioclavicular joint dislocations are graded from I to VI. Grading is based upon the degree of separation of the acromion from the clavicle with weight applied to the arm. Grade I is slight displacement of the joint, and a badly stretched or partially torn AC ligament. It has the normal separation of <4 mm. Grade II is a partial dislocation of the AC joint with a complete disruption tear of the AC joint and a partial disruption of coracoclavicular ligament. The AC gap is >5 mm. Grades I and II never require surgery and heal by themselves, though physical therapy may be required. Grade III is complete disruption of AC and CC ligaments. On plain film the inferior aspect of the clavicle will be above the superior aspect of the acromion. This can also be assessed with an MRI scan, which will also demonstrate disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments (the degree depending on the severity of AC joint disruption) as well as tearing of the joint capsule. The joint will be very tender and swollen on examination. Grade III separations most often do not require surgery and shoulder function should return to normal after 16‚Äì20 weeks. However, there will be some physical deformity of the shoulder with a noticeable bump resulting from the dislocation of the clavicle. Grades IV-VI are complications on a 'standard' dislocation involving a displacement of the clavicle, and will almost always require surgery. Dynamic US is critical to detect mild (grade I) dislocations, especially because they may present as a normal joint in static images. Doppler US may also be used to increase diagnostic confidence to detect low-grade injuries because it depicts reparative process to injured ligament.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013 =Osteoarthritis= Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is not uncommon. It may be caused by a prior trauma (secondary osteoarthritis) or occur as a chronic degenerative disorder often co-existing with subacromial impingement.

During the night, eight homeless people, including six minors, were killed by a group of men beside the Candel√°ria Church. Several of the men were members of the police and were tried for the killings, but only two were convicted. Background The Candel√°ria Church is a famous historic Roman Catholic church in central Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The church itself and the buildings around it in Pius X Square became known as a popular location for possibly hundreds of Rio de Janeiro's street children to form a makeshift home at night. The church's personnel provides food, shelter, education and religious advice to as many of these children as possible. Many of the homeless children are involved with the illegal drug trade and prostitution, and because many of these children also live around the church during the day, police keep a constant watch on the church's surroundings. In the early 1990s, the area around the Candel√°ria Church developed a high crime rate as street children increasingly began to commit criminal activities such as pickpocketing and robbery. Massacre According to survivors, on the morning of July 22, 1993, the day before the massacre, a group of children threw stones at police cars, with some of the policemen allegedly saying \\"don't worry, we will get you soon!\\" to threaten them. As the children from the Candel√°ria Church area were usually only given warnings by policemen, the young perpetrators left without worrying too much about the threat. At midnight, several Chevrolet Chevette cars with covered license plates came to a halt in front of the Candel√°ria Church, and the occupants began shooting at the group of roughly seventy street children sleeping in the vicinity of the church. =List of those killed= *Paulo Roberto de Oliveira, 11 years old *Anderson de Oliveira Pereira, 13 years old *Marcelo C√¢ndido de Jesus, 14 years old *Valdevino Miguel de Almeida, 14 years old *\\"Gambazinho\\", 17 years old *Leandro Santos da Concei√ß√£o, 17 years old *Paulo Jos√© da Silva, 18 years old *Marcos Ant√¥nio Alves da Silva, 20 years old Aftermath Six children and two adults were killed and numerous others were wounded outside the Candel√°ria Church. Subsequently, during the investigations the shots were found to be fired by policemen, and fifty officers were accused of the massacre. One of them, Mauricio da Concei√ß√£o, died during a shootout as he was about to be arrested in 1994. Two others, Marcos Emmanuel and Nelson Cunha, were handed sentences equivalent to life sentences. However, they could potentially avoid the imprisonment, as Brazilian law says that anyone who gets a sentence of twenty or more years in jail, automatically qualifies for a second trial. One of the children that survived that attack was supposedly shot several times before he could testify against policemen that were to go to trial, and ended up fleeing from Brazil in order to save his life. The international community severely condemned the attack, and many in Brazil asked for the prosecution of those who shot the Candel√°ria Church children. The event also was mentioned in the song The Candelaria Massacre recorded by a Brazilian death metal band Lacerated And Carbonized (from the 2013's album The Core of Disruption). =Survivors= A social worker who later tracked the fate of these homeless survivors of the Candel√°ria massacre found out that eventually 39 of them were either killed by police or by elements of street life, and discusses this in Bus 174, centered around the Nascimento incident.

It was named by Queensland Rail in 1914. Prior to this, the area was known as Four Mile and Pryns Station. Woree State School was opened on 5 May 1925 and closed circa 1953. In October 1954, it was decided to relocate its buildings which were relocated to Holloway's Beach to establish a school there (which opened in 1955). The present Woree State School opened in January 1980. Saint Mary's College opened 1 January 1986. Woree State High School opened on 29 January 1985.

The dam is located in the range immediately west of Cairns. History Originally Cairns' water needs were met with water drawn from Freshwater Creek and Behana Creek. It was evident to even the earliest settlers that a larger source of water would need to be secured as Cairns grew. With this in mind, one of the city's engineers, F Morris, explored the Lamb Range to the west of the city to find a place to build a dam. In 1935 he found a site at Copperlode falls, near the headwaters of Freshwater Creek, that he thought would be suitable. Many years later, after a series of surveys confirmed the site's suitability, the Queensland Government approved the site for construction of an earth and rock fill dam. The State Government originally set aside A$3 million for the dam, but by the time the dam was completed on 25 March 1976, the total cost had risen to approximately $6.5 million. The reservoir holds 45,000 megalitres of water (in comparison to Lake Tinaroo's 407,000 megalitres). The reservoir is named Lake Morris after Cairns City engineer Frank Roland Morris who discovered its site, but the dam itself is named after the waterfalls it replaced - Copperlode Falls.

(born 1 January 1972), is a Belgian musician and film director. Barman studied at the film school of St.-Lucas in Brussels, but didn't finish his studies because he wished to pursue a career in music. In 1989, he began by forming the rock band, dEUS, in Antwerp. Although he had chosen music over his interest in film, his experience aided him in directing his own music videos for dEUS, and he made a short film in 1996 titled Turnpike. He also directed videos for other Belgian musicians including Axelle Red and Hooverphonic among others. He is of Norwegian descent from his father's side. In the summer of 2002 shooting started in Antwerp for his first feature film Any Way the Wind Blows which was released in Belgian cinemas in the summer of 2003. In February 2004, he released \\"The Body Gave You Everything\\", the debut album by Magnus, his dance-oriented project with techno producer CJ Bolland. Barman has explored the other side of the camera as well. He agreed to a \\"leading role\\" allowing directors, Manu Riche and Renaat Lambeet to film a documentary derived by Barman's everyday life, entitled Tempo of a Restless Soul. After showing at the Ghent Film Festival one reviewer from Flanders Today ranked the film with a split score. He feels the film should receive three of five stars for fans only, and two stars for others. Deus fans already familiar with Barman, he pointed out, may be interested in the backstage, personal nature of the man due to the everyday \\"fly on the wall\\" view of the film. However, he cautioned, it might be confusing to find the semi-retiring rock frontman behind scenes. Barman is again playing with Deus. In 2006, Barman was one of the driving forces behind the 0110 concerts. Barman was involved in polemics in Belgium, when after expressing strong opposition towards male sexual harassment on Belgian national TV, a Dutch woman referred to meeting him some 15 years ago, where Barman insisted her to give him a blowjob in order to have access to a toilet. Barman excused himself for this.

ECOSOCC is made up of civil society organizations from a wide range of sectors including labour, business and professional groups, service providers and policy think tanks, both from within Africa and the African diaspora. The Interim President of ECOSOCC was Kenyan Nobel Prize winner Prof. Wangari Maathai. In 2008, she was replaced as President by Cameroonian lawyer Akere Muna of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU). Legal framework ECOSOCC is provided for in the African Union Constitutive Act, but does not have its own protocol, relying rather on Statutes approved by the AU Assembly. The ECOSOCC Statutes provide for four main bodies: * A 150-member General Assembly, made up of 144 elected representatives (two from each Member State, ten operating at regional level, eight at continental level and 20 from the diaspora) and six representatives of CSOs nominated by the AU Commission, to be the highest decision-making body of the organ. * A 15-member standing committee with representatives from the five regions of Africa to coordinate the work of the organ. * 10 sectoral cluster committees for feeding opinion and inputs into the policies and programmes of the AU. * A five-person credentials committee for determining the eligibility of CSO representatives to contest elections or participate in the processes of the organ. The 10 Sectoral Cluster Committees are: *Peace and Security Committee *Political Affairs Committee *Infrastructure and Energy Committee *Social Affairs and Health Committee *Human Resources, Sciences and Technology Committee *Trade and Industry Committee *Rural Economy and Agriculture Committee *Economic Affairs Committee *Women and Gender Committee *Cross-Cutting Programs Committee =Membership criteria= The criteria established by the ECOSOCC Statutes for membership include that candidates should: * Be national, regional, continental or African diaspora CSOs, without restriction to undertake regional or international activities. * Have objectives and principles that are consistent with the principles and objectives of the Union. * Be registered in a Member State of the African Union and/or meet the general conditions of eligibility for the granting of observer status to non governmental organizations. * Show proof that the ownership and management of the CSO is made up of not less than 50% of Africans or African diaspora. * Show that the resources of the organisation derive at least 50% from contributions of the members of the organization. The requirements on funding from membership contributions mean that many African NGOs are not eligible for membership of ECOSOCC. Establishment Interim ECOSOCC structures were established in 2005. Elections to replace these structures were finally held in 23 African states and at continental level in late 2007. Although elections had not been completed in the remaining countries, the official launch of the new ECOSOCC General Assembly took place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 9 September 2008. The Citizens and Diaspora Office (CIDO) in the AU Commission acts as secretariat for ECOSOCC. =Membership of interim structures= The council also has four vice presidents.

Bedwas RFC was a founding member of both the Junior Monmouthshire League (1903) and the Rhymney Valley League (1906), and in 1910 applied for and succeeded in joining the Welsh Rugby Union. At the outbreak of World War I (1914) rugby ceased in most of South Wales and this was true of Bedwas. After the war a period of rebuilding occurred with the club based initially at the Church Inn before moving to Bridge End Inn during the 1920‚Äì21 season. During this period Bedwas RFC enjoyed connections with local colliery owner and airline magnate Sir Samuel Instone.Rugby in Wales 1926 saw a great economic depression in South Wales and as local young men left to find work in more prosperous areas, rugby in Bedwas waned. Post World War II saw a rebuilding of rugby in Bedwas and in 1947 the club acquired Bridge field and an ex-Ministry of Works long hut which became the club house. In 1960 the club formed a youth team. Bedwas also have a very successful seconds side which remains undefeated in the 2007‚Äì08 season. In 2007, Bedwas were the only club in the Welsh Premier League to be threatened with relegation due to them initially failing a facilities review conducted by the WRU.

The series is notable for being the last in a series of three comedies by co-writer David Croft to use many of the same actors, starting with Hi-de-Hi! and followed by You Rang, M'Lord? and was also the last full series written by David Croft.  Introduction  Oh, Doctor Beeching! focuses on the small fictional branch line railway station of Hatley, which is threatened with closure under the Beeching Axe. The programme was filmed on the Severn Valley Railway. Arley SVR station in Upper Arley was used as Hatley station.  Plot  Set in 1963, at a rural branch line railway station called Hatley, Jack Skinner (Paul Shane) the porter is acting stationmaster until a replacement is found. Jack deeply loves his wife May (played by Sherrie Hewson in the pilot episode, with her scenes re-recorded by Julia Deakin when repeated as the first episode of the regular series) who runs the station buffet, but is prone to becoming very jealous of her around other men. Without a station master the station has become rather disorganised: for instance the eternally miserable signalman Harry Lambert (Stephen Lewis), is so underworked that he is running several sidelines from his signalbox ‚Äì including hair- cutting, selling fruit and vegetables, repairing bicycles and taking bets ‚Äì seeing his signalling duties as an unwelcome distraction; he frequently speaks of \\"ruddy trains\\". The station is part run by the eccentric and easily flustered booking clerk Ethel Schumann (Su Pollard), who is always on the lookout for a new man in her life and whose son Wilfred (Paul Aspden), the product of a relationship with a now deceased American soldier during the war, is the station dogsbody. Wilfred often comes across as stupid, but sometimes displays signs that he is brighter than he appears ‚Äì for instance in the episode \\"The Van\\", he finds Arnold's missing wife Jessica. Also present are Vera Plumtree (Barbara New), who has no particular role, but seems to do various jobs around the station and acts as Mr Parkin's housekeeper. Her late husband used to work on the railway, as she frequently reminds the other members of staff; her catchphrase is \\"he was an engine driver you know\\". She very often muddles her words and seems to be fond of Harry (who always ignores her advances) and Gloria (Lindsay Grimshaw), Jack and May's pretty teenage daughter, who loves wearing short skirts, much to the chagrin of her father. She shows an interest in men, but Jack is over-protective and will not let any man take her out. Several other members of railway staff appear, including an older engine driver Arnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts); his inexperienced fireman Ralph (Perry Benson), who is training to be a driver; and the flirtatious guard, Percy (Terry John), with whom Ethel appears to be quite besotted at times. He returns her advances, but seems to prefer Gloria's friend, Amy Matlock (Tara Daniels), who appears in most episodes, albeit usually briefly. Richard Spendlove, one of the writers and the co-creator, also appeared in several episodes as Mr Orkindale, the district inspector. Soon the new stationmaster arrives in the guise of Cecil Parkin (Jeffrey Holland), a stern, well spoken man. He is amazed to learn that the caf√© is run by May (then called Blanchflower), with whom he had a passionate fling during the war before she married Jack ‚Äì although we later learn that she was seeing both of them at the same time. Although Jack is in the dark as to May and Cecil's history, he takes an instant dislike to the new stationmaster. A running subplot to the series is the question of whether Gloria is actually Jack's daughter, or the result of May's fling with Cecil (although in the second series episode \\"Father's Day\\", it is generally concluded that Jack is her father). Meanwhile, at the end of the episode a newspaper article is found threatening the station with closure under the Beeching Axe, which begins the series. A running gag in the series is Vera almost finding out about Cecil and May's relationship. Mr Parkin steals every moment he possibly can with May, often sneaking into the kitchen near the beginning of the day, before anyone else has arrived and Vera catching them almost every time. The series ran for two series, although the final episode did not conclude by answering whether the station was going to be closed, as it was unknown at the time of production whether a third series would be produced or not. The series was axed due to unsatisfactory viewing figures, later blamed on the BBC for constantly altering the time of broadcasting as one episode was broadcast in August due to the broadcast of the 1997 Athletics World Championship in Athens on 3 and 10 August, The Great Antiques Hunt broadcast on 24 August and the wall to wall coverage of the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 August. Episodes Main cast Cecil Parkin (Jeffrey Holland) Stationmaster ‚Äì the new stationmaster at Hatley who appears midway through the first episode. He is a perfectionist and is determined to make the station the best on the line. On the surface, he seems refined, but it turns out that he knows the station's buffet manager because they had a passionate affair, which was going on behind her boyfriend (later husband) Jack Skinner's back. He still has lecherous thoughts about her and in several episodes he tries his best to get her to leave Jack. The station staff react to him in different ways ‚Äì most are tolerant of him, but Jack and Harry, the signalman, take an intense dislike to him, which only slightly mellows as the series goes on. Jack Skinner (Paul Shane) Head Porter and Deputy Stationmaster ‚Äì He is deeply in love with his beautiful wife, May, but gets very jealous whenever she comes into close contact with other men, especially Cecil. He heartily dislikes Cecil and shows it. He is an ex-soldier with a limp from a wound he supposedly received during the war - only in Episode 9 we learn that his leg was wounded when he was thrown out of a pub and the landlord's wife slammed the door on his foot, not during a battle, although Ethel changed the story to him jumping on a German tank to shove a land mine down it and a big German trapped his foot in the door. Ethel Schumann (Su Pollard) Ticket Clerk ‚Äì She is scatter-brained and sometimes muddles her words. She often gets frustrated with Jack for his jealousy of May. She is also a flirt ‚Äì she has a son from her marriage to a now deceased American soldier named Earl, whom she frequently refers to in the earlier episodes. She is desperate for another boyfriend and frequently makes advances to the station's guard, Percy, who appreciates her advances, but seems more interested in the regular commuter, Amy. She is the only one who knows of Cecil and May's war-time fling once May tells her. Harry Lambert (Stephen Lewis) Signalman ‚Äì He is eternally miserable, with Stephen Lewis portraying the character very much like \\"Blakey\\" in On the Buses. He never smiles and often sees the down side of things, never being seen happy. He hates his job, often calling the trains \\"ruddy\\". Because trains come through Hatley only a few times a day, he operates numerous sidelines from his box: growing vegetables, mending bikes and clocks, rearing farm animals (pigs, turkeys and chickens) for the staff's dinners, giving haircuts and taking bets. They are all illegal, yet all the staff, including Gloria know about them, are customers and keep their mouths shut. Cecil does not know, as he would make it stop. There is a recurring gag, where Harry will say, \\"if they poke their noses around, they will get the flat end o' my tongue\\", that person comes and he starts sucking up to them. He often resists Vera's advances. May Skinner (n√©e Blanchflower) (Julia Deakin) Buffet Manageress ‚Äì She had a passionate affair with Cecil Parkin before she married Jack, which ended when Cecil was called up to serve in the Army. She appears to genuinely love Jack, but she seems to still have buried feelings for Cecil. She frequently resists Cecil's advances, but occasionally relents, even letting him kiss her in Episode 10, but states that it must never happen again. In early episodes it is hinted that Cecil is the father of her daughter, Gloria, but this is proved to be false in Episode 11. Vera Plumtree (Barbara New) Cleaner ‚Äì She helps the staff by cleaning their homes and washing linen for them. She has a lot in common with Ethel: she muddles her words and frequently talks about her unnamed late husband, who was an engine driver. She is fond of Harry, but he is not interested in her. Wilfred Schumann (Paul Aspden, credited as Paul Aspen) Porter ‚Äì Ethel's son. Most of the time he comes across as extremely stupid. He is often verbally abused and hit around the head by Jack. Wilfred joins the Army in one episode so as to allow Ethel to elope with her new American airmen boyfriend, but she ends the relationship. Wilfred was born in 1946, making him 17. Gloria Skinner (Lindsay Grimshaw) ‚Äì Jack and May's daughter. A rebellious teenager, very fond of short skirts and the company of older men. She has a crush on Cecil Parkin, the new station master and Percy, the guard. Jack is over-protective however and will let no man in the station take Gloria out. Gloria was born in February 1945, making her 18. Percy (Terry John) Guard ‚Äì the main station flirt. He flirts with every woman he comes into contact with, except Vera. But he seems to prefer Amy above others: he takes her out on several dates during the series, often leaving Ethel in the lurch. We learn in Episode 14 that he keeps promising to take Ethel out, but never does. Arnold Thomas (Ivor Roberts) Train Driver ‚Äì An older train-driver. He is the star of the penultimate episode, where he goes to great lengths to make sure he is not sacked. He has a wife called Jessica, who appears to be forgetful. He alludes to her in almost every episode, but she only appears briefly in an uncredited role in Episode 13. The actress was Ivor Roberts' real life wife also. Ralph (Perry Benson) Fireman and Trainee Driver ‚Äì Works with Arnold ‚Äì the two often engage in comic banter. Ralph can be as daft as Wilfred and is slow at learning to drive ‚Äì but he drives the train perfectly in the final episode. One episode centres around him ‚Äì in Episode 14 he threatens to go on strike. It is also revealed that he has a crush on Gloria. Amy (Tara Daniels), best school friend of Gloria's, she appears in most of the episodes. She is often the object of Percy's desires. Mr Orkindale (Richard Spendlove) District Inspector ‚Äì Senior to Parkin, calls staff by Christian names and fancies May. Dislikes Mr Parkin as much as everyone else and in Episode 17 cheats him out of a place on the bowls club outing just so he can have a few extra drinks. Guest appearances Other actors who had previously collaborated with David Croft made guest appearances. A former Hi-De-Hi! regular Felix Bowness made a number of appearances as train guard Bernie Bleasdale. Windsor Davies appeared in the final episode as the Mayor of Clumberfield, when the station staff re-enacted the station's opening for its 100th anniversary. James Pertwee, son of the actor Bill Pertwee, made an appearance as a photographer in this final episode also. Sally Grace appeared in Episode 7 as Mr Parkin's fianc√©e, Edna. Hugh Lloyd made an appearance in one episode as a chauffeur. Featured locomotive The LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 No 46521 from the Severn Valley Railway was used on the film set and carried the name \\"Blossom\\". At the time of filming the engine normally resided on the Severn Valley Railway. Blossom was subsequently sold to the Loughborough Standard Locomotive Group, which is based at the Great Central Railway. The engine was on loan to different railways before having an overhaul, after which it returned to service with a main line 'ticket'.  Title and music  The title was a reference to the music hall song and Will Hay film Oh, Mr Porter! and a modified version was sung as the end titles by actress Su Pollard: :Oh, Dr Beeching what have you done? :There once were lots of trains to catch, but soon there will be none, :I'll have to buy a bike, 'cos I can't afford a car, :Oh, Dr Beeching what a naughty man you are!  Home release  The first series was released on VHS and DVD in 2004 and the second series on DVD only, in 2005. The packaging of the first series was slightly misleading by stating that it \\"included the pilot\\", but it really contained the revised first episode and not the original version of the pilot. Edits are made to certain episodes because of copyright music issues. A complete box set containing both series and all 19 episodes (also including the original pilot) was made available, distributed by Acorn Media UK in 2009. It was later discontinued but it was made available again in 2017.

It has been confused with B. smithi; both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas. Many earlier sources referring to B. smithi either do not distinguish between the two species or relate to B. hamorii. B. hamorii is a terrestrial tarantula native to the western faces of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges in the Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n. The species is a large spider, adult females having a total body length over and males having legs up to long. Mexican redknee tarantulas are a popular choice for enthusiasts. Like most tarantulas, it has a long lifespan. Description St. Louis Zoo Brachypelma hamorii is a large spider. A sample of seven females had a total body length (excluding chelicerae and spinnerets) in the range . A sample of 11 males was slightly smaller, with a total body length in the range . Although males have slightly shorter bodies, they have longer legs. The fourth leg is the longest, measuring in the type male and in a female. The legs and palps are black to reddish black with three distinctly colored rings, deep orange on the part of the patellae closest to the body with pale orange‚Äìyellow further away, pale orange‚Äìyellow on the lower part of the tibiae, and yellowish-white at the end of the metatarsi. Adult males have light greyish-red around the border of the carapace with a darker reddish-black marking from the middle of the carapace to the front of the head; the upper surface of the abdomen is black. Adult females vary more in carapace color and pattern. The carapace may be mainly black with a brownish- pink border, or the dark area may be broken up into a \\"starburst\\" pattern with pale orange‚Äìyellow elsewhere. Taxonomy Brachypelma hamorii was initially misidentified as the very similar B. smithi, a species originally described in 1897. In 1968, the holotype of B. smithi was found to be an immature male, and in 1994, A. M. Smith redescribed B. smithi using two adult specimens. The specimens cannot now be found, but his description makes it clear that they actually belonged to what is now B. hamorii, not B. smithi. B. hamorii was first described by Marc Tesmoingt, Fr√©d√©ric Cleton and Jean Verdez in 1997. They stated that it was close to B. smithi, but could be distinguished by a number of characteristics, including the spermathecae of the females. However, following Smith's description, B. hamorii continued to be misidentified as B. smithi until the situation was clarified by J. Mendoza and O. Francke in 2017. The two species have very similar color patterns. When viewed from above, the chelicerae of B. hamorii have two brownish-pink bands on a greyish background, not visible on all individuals. B. smithi lacks these bands. Mature males of the two species can be distinguished by the shape of the palpal bulb. When viewed retrolaterally, the palpal bulb of B. hamorii is narrower and less straight than the broad, spoon-shaped one of B. smithi. It also has a narrower keel at the apex. In mature females of B. hamorii, the baseplate of the spermatheca is elliptical, rather than divided and subtriangular as in B. smithi; also, the ventral face of the spermatheca is smooth rather than striated. =DNA barcoding= DNA barcoding has been applied to Mexican species of Brachypelma. In this approach, a portion of about 650 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I is used, primarily to identify existing species, but also sometimes to support a separation between species. In 2017, Mendoza and Francke showed that although B. hamorii and B. smithi are similar in external appearance, they are clearly distinguished by their DNA barcodes. Longevity B. hamorii grows very slowly and matures relatively late. The females of this species can live up to 30 years, but the males tend to live for only 5 years or so. Molting Like all tarantulas, B. hamorii is an arthropod, and must go through a molting process to grow. Molting serves several purposes, such as renewing the tarantula's outer cover (shell) and replacing missing appendages. As tarantulas grow, they regularly molt (shed their skin), on multiple occasions during the year, depending on the tarantula's age. Since the exoskeleton cannot stretch, it must be replaced by a new one from beneath for the tarantula to grow. A tarantula may also regenerate lost appendages gradually, with each succeeding molt. Prior to molting, the spider becomes sluggish and stops eating to conserve as much energy as possible. Its abdomen darkens; this is the new exoskeleton beneath. Normally, the spider turns on its back to molt and stays in that position for several hours, as it pushes fluids just beneath its old exoskeleton and wiggles its limbs to loosen off the old and reveal the new exoskeleton. Once this has been accomplished, the tarantula does not eat for several days to weeks, and not uncommonly for up to a month after a molt, as its fangs are still soft; the fangs are also part of the exoskeleton and are shed with the rest of the skin. The whole process can take several hours and sheaths the tarantula with a moist, new skin in place of an old, faded one. Behavior Like most New World tarantulas, they kick urticating hairs from their abdomens and their back legs if disturbed, rather than bite. They are only slightly venomous to humans and are considered extremely docile, though, as with all tarantulas, their large fangs can cause very painful puncture wounds, which can lead to secondary bacterial infection if not properly treated and allergies may intensify with any bite.Schultz, Stanley A. and Schultz, Marguerite J. (2009) The Tarantula Keeper's Guide: Comprehensive Information on Care, Housing, and Feeding (Revised Edition). Barrons. Distribution and habitat thumbupright=1.5Distribution of some Brachypelma species in Mexico: ‚ñà‚ñà B. hamorii ‚ñà‚ñà B. smithi These two were formerly often treated as the same species under the name B. smithi. B. hamorii and the very similar B. smithi are found along the Pacific Coast of Mexico on opposite sides of the Balsas River basin as it opens onto the Pacific. B. hamorii is found to the north, in the states of Colima, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n. The natural habitat of the species is in hilly deciduous tropical forests. It constructs or extends burrows under logs, rocks, and tree roots, among thorny shrubs and tall grass. Their burrows were described in 1999 by a source that did not distinguish between B. hamorii and B. smithi. The deep burrows keep them protected from predators, such as the white-nosed coati, and enable them to ambush passing prey. The females spend the majority of their lives in their burrows, which are typically located in, or not far from, vegetation, and consist of a single entrance with a tunnel leading to one or two chambers. The entrance is just slightly larger than the body size of the spider. The tunnel, usually about three times the tarantula's leg span in length, leads to a chamber that is large enough for the spider to safely molt. Further down the burrow, via a shorter tunnel, a larger chamber is located where the spider rests and eats its prey. When the tarantula needs privacy, e.g. when molting or laying eggs, the entrance is sealed with silk, sometimes supplemented with soil and leaves. Conservation In 1985, B. smithi (then not distinguished from B. hamorii) was placed on CITES Appendix II. Wild-caught specimens shipped for the Chinese market were decreasing in size. The smaller sizes were suspected to be a consequence of a declining population due to excessive export. Exporting is not the only threat, though; some local people have reportedly made a habit of killing these spiders in a nearly systematic way using pesticides, pouring gasoline into burrows, or simply killing migrating spiders on sight. The reasons for these actions seem to be an irrational fear based on myth surrounding B. hamorii and related species. Thus, whether the listing strengthened the wild population or not remains uncertain. The species has been bred successfully in captivity. In 1994, all remaining Brachypelma species were added to Appendix II. Large numbers of Mexican redknee tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico. At least 3,000 specimens of Mexican tarantulas were reported to have been sent to the United States or Europe a few years prior to 2017, most of which were Mexican redknee tarantulas.

He was also considered an accomplished Neo-Confucian and Taoist scholar (especially in the I Ching), and was a distinguished contributor to the theory of internal martial arts through his many published works. Biography He was born in Hebei and was named Sun Fuquan () by his parents. Years later, his Baguazhang teacher Cheng Tinghua () gave him the name Sun Lutang. (It was common in old China for people to have multiple names). He continued to use his original name in some areas, including the publishing of his books. He was also well-versed in two other internal martial arts: xingyiquan (hsing-i ch'uan) and baguazhang (pa-kua chang) before he came to study taijiquan (t'ai chi ch'uan). His expertise in these two martial arts were so high that many regarded him as without equal. Sun learned Wu (Hao)-style t'ai chi ch'uan from Hao Wei-chen. Sun started studying with Hao relatively late in his life, but his accomplishments in the other two internal arts led him to develop his t'ai chi abilities to a high standard more quickly than is usual. He subsequently was invited by Yang Shao-hou, Yang Chengfu and Wu Chien-ch'√ºan to join them on the faculty of the Beijing Physical Education Research Institute where they taught t'ai chi to the public after 1914.

It has a total enrollment of about 680 pupils ages 11 to 18. Bedwas High School was inspected by Estyn, the office of Her Majesty's School Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales, in 2007 and the school received a favourable report with five 2s and two 1s. In 2015-16 the school was ranked in the red support category by the Welsh categoristion system. This is the lowest of the 4 possible ratings. There are approximately 680 pupils in attendance at the school including those in the sixth form. The school was officially opened in May 1962 (although pupils had been attending since the previous September) to move the Tyn-y-Wern Secondary School from Trethomas. Originally, the school was a community school under Monmouthshire County Council but when county boundaries were revised in 1973, it became one of 46 comprehensive schools in Mid Glamorgan. As a result of local Government reorganisation in 1996, it became one of 16 comprehensive schools in Caerphilly County Borough. From September 2007, as the result of closure of two of the secondary schools in the Borough (Bedwellty in 2005 and St Ilan in 2007), it became one of 14 secondary schools. The school serves the community to the east of the River Rhymney. This is made up of the villages of Bedwas, Trethomas, Graig-y-Rhacca and Machen. The school has five feeder schools in its designated catchment area (including Plasyfelin from September 2007) but, in addition, approximately 10% of the pupils come to Bedwas High School from outside the catchment area. Estyn report from April 2013 =Context= Bedwas High School is an English-medium 11 to 18 mixed comprehensive school situated to the east of Caerphilly. The school serves the communities from the villages of Bedwas, Trethomas, Graig-y-Rhacca and Machen. The number of pupils has increased from 694 at the time of the last inspection to the current 752. Around 26% of pupils are entitled to free school meals, which is higher than the national average of 17.4%, and 41% of pupils live in 20% most deprived areas of Wales. The pupils entering the school represent the full range of ability and around 22% have a special educational need. This figure is higher than the national average of 18.6%. Around 3% of pupils have statements of special educational needs. This compares with 2.6% for Wales as a whole. A very few pupils receive support to learn English as an additional language and a very few pupils come from minority-ethnic backgrounds. A very small number of the pupils speak Welsh as their first language. The headteacher has been in post since September 2008. Following the retirement of the school's deputy headteacher Mrs Sue Rivers, the school appointed a new deputy headteacher, Mr Tom Stancombe, in September 2012.http://www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6764093/ www.estyn.gov.uk/english/provider/6764093 In March 2019, the school came out of special measures, which followed the 2017 Esytn inspection,https://www.estyn.gov.wales/sites/www.estyn.gov.wales/files/documents/Bedwas%20High%20School.pdf and moved into monitoring.https://www.estyn.gov.wales/sites/www.estyn.gov.wales/files/documents/Monitoring%20Report%20Bedwas%20HS.pdf References External links *Bedwas High School - Official Website *Caerphilly Borough Council listing for Bedwas Comprehensive Category:Secondary schools in Caerphilly County Borough Category:Educational institutions established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in Wales ","title":"Bedwas High School"},{"id":"1911967","text":"Rajnold Suchodolski (1804 ‚Äì 8 September 1831, Warsaw) was a Polish poet.

It was superseded by the Mark 46 torpedo, beginning in the late 1960s. The Royal Australian Navy, however, continued to use it alongside its successor for a number of years, because the Mark 44 was thought to have superior performance in certain shallow-water conditions. It has been deployed by many navies and air forces including the USN, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Air Force from various launch vehicles. These include long-range maritime patrol aircraft, e.g. P-3 Orion, RAF Nimrod, Canadair Argus, LAMPS and other embarked naval helicopters, ASROC missiles, Ikara missiles. Development AD-4 Skyraider launching Mark 44 torpedo During the 1950s the US Navy ordered development of a new generation of lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. Two programs were started, the EX-2A at the Naval Ordnance Test Station Pasadena (NOTS-Pasadena) and the EX-2B at General Electric Ordnance Department, Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The EX-2A was to have its counter-rotating propeller driven directly by an electric motor, while the EX-2B was to use a gas turbine connected to a gearbox. After an accident with the proposed fuel for the EX-2B (Propyl Nitrate) the US Navy ordered the halting of its use. This resulted in the EX-2B development team shifting to an electric motor using the design for a jet engine starter motor as the basis to give the high torque and RPM the counter-rotating gearbox needed. The shroud design around the control surfaces of the EX-2B was also redesigned, as it was discovered that having the shroud around the control surfaces themselves reduced their effectiveness, as a result the length of the shroud was reduced. After several evaluations the EX-2B was selected and designated the Mark 44 Mod 0. After some fine tuning of the design, an enhanced version the Mark 44 Mod 1 entered United States service in 1956. However shortly after the torpedo entered service it became apparent that newer Soviet submarines were both faster and deeper diving, and could potentially both outrun and out-dive the Mk.44 which was designed to attack targets with a maximum speed of only 17 knots. To address this an operational requirement was issued in 1960 resulting in the acceptance into service of the Mk.46 torpedo in 1963, when it began to replace the Mk.44 in U.S. service. A number of upgrade packages have been offered for the torpedo, a 1986 Honeywell kit replaced the magnetostrictive transducers with ceramic transducers in a planar array, and the replacement of the analogue guidance electronics with a digital system. The overall effect of these changes was to triple the searched volume of the torpedo by increasing detection range by 75% and reducing the minimum shallow water search depth by 47%. With this modification the torpedo is known in South Korea as the KT44. A South African package offered an extensive upgrade, replacing the warhead with a 45 kilogram shaped charge device capable of penetrating 40 millimeters of steel behind a 1.5 meter water filled double hull. The package also included a comprehensive digital electronics upgrade tripling the target acquisition range to 1,000 meters in ideal conditions, and containing a number of counter-counter measures along with a variety of attack modes. The torpedo is, however, coming to the end of its usable life as the batteries have expired in many of the torpedoes. The New Zealand navy retired its Mark 44s in 1993 because it decided against renewing the batteries. Description The Mark 44 is a modular design, consisting of four main sections. The blunt nose contains the active sonar seeker with the 75-pound (34 kg) high-explosive warhead immediately behind it. The second section contains the guidance and gyroscopes. The third contains the 24 kilowatt seawater battery which uses silver chloride and magnesium electrodes with seawater acting as the electrolyte. Finally is the propulsion section which houses the electric motor, four rectangular control fins and two contra-rotating propellers. The vacuum tube-based guidance system is more sophisticated than earlier torpedoes, using pre-launch settings enabling an initial search depth of 50, 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet as well as a search floor at 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet as well as a maximum dive/climb angle of 4.5, 6 or 7 degrees. On impacting the water the torpedo either runs out for 1,000 yards or performs a dive at a 30-degree angle to the search depth. After completing this it may perform a flat turn and begins a helical search pattern proceeding up or down until it hits either the minimum depth of 50 yards or the search floor. When it hits either top or bottom, it performs a flat turn and begins to execute the search in reverse. It continues executing this search until it either finds a target or exhausts its six-minute endurance. The guidance system could drive the active sonar at either a slow rate or a fast rate, which it used when the target drew near to obtain a precise proximity and rate of closure. The air dropped version of the torpedo is fitted with a parachute retarding system to slow entry into the water, and the nose is protected from the impact by a fairing which is immediately discarded upon entering the water. The propellers are covered by a ring fairing.

Introduced by the German firm Flettner, servo tabs were formerly known as Flettner tabs. Servo tabs are not true servomechanisms, as they do not employ negative feedback to keep the control surfaces in a desired position; they only provide a mechanical advantage to the pilot. Servo tabs A servo tab moves in the direction opposite to the desired movement of the control surface. It deflects airflow, generating force on the whole control surface in the desired direction. The tab has a leverage advantage, being located well aft of the control surface hinge line, and thus its airflow deflection moves the control surface in the opposite direction, overcoming the resistance generated by the airflow deflection of the control surface. This has the effect of reducing the control force required from the pilot to move the controls.Crane, Dale. Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, p. 456. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. From the Ground Up, 27th Revised Edition, Aviation Publishers, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, 1996, p. 14. In some large aircraft, the servo tab is the only control that is connected to the pilot's stick or wheel, as in the Bristol Britannia and its Canadian derivatives. The pilot moves the wheel, which moves the servo tab; the servo tab with its mechanical advantage moves the elevator or aileron, which is otherwise free- floating. With the \\"geared spring tab\\" variant, a pilot is able \\"to maneuver a vehicle weighing as much as 300,000 pounds flying at an airspeed of 300 miles per hour or more\\".W.H. Phillips, A Career at NASA Langley Research Center. Chapter 6, \\"The Quest for Reduced Control Forces\\"; and NACA Rep. 794 (1944) Anti-servo tabs American Aviation AA-1 Yankee. An anti-servo tab, or anti-balance tab, works in the opposite way to a servo tab. It deploys in the same direction as the control surface, making the movement of the control surface more difficult and requires more force applied to the controls by the pilot. This may seem counter-productive, but it is commonly used on aircraft where the controls are too light or the aircraft requires additional stability in that axis of movement. The anti-servo tab serves mainly to make the controls heavier in feel to the pilotStick force per g and also to increase stability.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, p. 34. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. An anti-servo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve control pressure and maintain the stabilator in the desired position.

It is unusual for its experimental style, expanding even further on the jazz fusion sound of Mitchell's Hejira from the year before. Mitchell has stated that, close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, she allowed this album to be looser than anything she'd done previously.Joni Mitchell Biography from jonimitchell.com Retrieved August 22, 2008 Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was released in December 1977 to mixed reviews, but managed to peak at No. 25 on the Billboard charts and attained gold record status within three months. Background and content Much of the album is experimental, but especially so are: \\"Overture,\\" played with six simultaneous guitars, some in different tunings from others, with vocal echo effects; \\"The Tenth World,\\" an extended-length instrumental of Latin percussion; and \\"Dreamland,\\" which features only percussion and voices (including Chaka Khan). Most experimental of all is \\"Paprika Plains,\\" a 16-minute song played on improvised piano and arranged with a full orchestra; it takes up all of Side 2. In it, Mitchell narrates a first-person description of a late-night gathering in a bar frequented by Indigenous peoples of Canada, touching on themes of hopelessness and alcoholism. At one point in the narrative, the narrator leaves the setting to watch the rain and enters into a dreamstate, and the lyrics ‚Äì printed in the liner notes but not sung ‚Äì become a mixture of references to innocent childhood memories, a nuclear explosion and an expressionless tribe gazing upon the dreamer. The narrator returns inside after the rain passes. In speaking to Anthony Fawcett about working on \\"Paprika Plains,\\" Mitchell said: > \\"The Improvisational, the spontaneous aspect of this creative process ‚Äì > still as a poet ‚Äì is to set words to the music, which is a hammer and chisel > process.

Oregon's portion of the Interstate Highway System totals .Oregon Department of Transportation, [www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Data/Documents/OMR_2006.pdf 2006 Oregon Mileage Report], July 2007 Transfers of highways between the state and county or local maintenance require the approval of the Oregon Transportation Commission (OTC), a five-member governor-appointed authority that meets monthly.Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Transportation Commission, accessed September 2007 These transfers often result in discontinuous highways, where a local government maintains part or all of a main road within its boundaries.Oregon Department of Transportation, Transferring Roads: Handbook for Making Jurisdictional Transfers, accessed September 2007 Two separate numbering systems are used; routes (e.g. Interstate 84, U.S. Route 26, and Oregon Route 140) are those used by the general public, and their shields are posted on guide signs and maps. These comprise the Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and Oregon state routes (e.g. OR 201). Highways, on the other hand, are used internally by ODOT; they are named and numbered (e.g. Pacific Highway No. 1, Willamette Highway No. 18). The two systems, while largely overlapping, are not congruent. Many routes are signed on streets which are maintained by counties and cities, and thus are not part of the state highway system at all, e.g. OR 8, whose eastern- and westernmost portions, Canyon Road and Gales Creek Road, are not actually state highways. On the other hand, some state highways are not signed as routes at all; the Beaverton‚ÄìTualatin Highway No. 141 has an official route designation (OR 141), but remains entirely unsigned. Signed routes may comprise several highways; for instance, OR 47 is overlaid on the Mist‚ÄìClatskanie Highway No. 110, Nehalem Highway No. 102, and Tualatin Valley Highway No. 29. Likewise, highways may consist of several routes; Tualatin Valley Highway No. 29 comprises parts of OR 8 and OR 47. Every highway is fully state-maintained, and every route is at least partially state-maintained. The OTC designates the paths of these routes as they follow state highways and local roads;Oregon Department of Transportation, Descriptions of US and OR Routes, July 2007 any U.S. Route or Interstate numbers must also be approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Route signs are maintained by the same agency as the roads they are posted along. If a local government maintains a numbered route, it signs an agreement with the state to keep the signs posted, thus keeping a continuous route for the benefit of travelers. History 1918 state highway map The initial primary state highway system was designated in 1917, initially consisting of 36 named and numbered highways,Oregon State Highway Commission, Proposed State Highway System, November 27, 1917 including some designated earlier that year by the Oregon State Legislature and others added to the network by the Oregon State Highway Commission, the predecessor to the OTC.Oregon Department of Transportation, History of State Highways in Oregon, January 2007 The first signed routes were the U.S. Routes, in 1926. It was not until 1932 that Oregon Routes were numbered by the OTC and marked by the Oregon State Highway Department;Oregon Department of Transportation, ODOT Approved Terms & Definitions , accessed September 2007 every primary state highway that was not already part of a U.S. Route received a route number at that time. Starting in late 1931, the state took over maintenance of many county \\"market roads\\", which became secondary state highways with three-digit numbers; some of these were assigned route numbers in 1935, but many others remained unsigned. 1940s-style sign for Oregon Route 50, incorporating the Seal of Oregon The primary, two-digit route numbers were laid out in a grid system, similar to the Interstate Highway System. Odd-numbered routes were north-south and increased in number bearing west, ranging from OR 3 in Wallowa County to OR 53 in Clatsop and Tillamook counties. Even-numbered routes were east-west and increased in number bearing south, ranging from OR 6 in Tillamook and Washington counties to OR 70 in Klamath County. East-west highways in eastern Oregon were given route numbers between OR 74 and OR 86, again increasing in number to the south. Despite this pattern, the internally used highway numbers for primary highways remained ad-hoc. A few route numbers were added after the 1930s, and broke these patterns for continuity reasons: OR 99, OR 126, OR 138, and OR 140. Secondary route numbers, three digits starting with 2, were laid out to generally increase bearing west. They ranged from OR 201 in Malheur County to OR 240 in Yamhill County. The internally used highway numbers for secondary highways were also three digit numbers, but were designated by county, from No. 10X in Clatsop County, No. 11X in Columbia County, No. 12X in Multnomah County, etc., until No. 45X in Malheur County. In 2002 and 2003, ODOT decided to assign route numbers to most of the previously unsigned secondary highways. Typically, these new route numbers were identical to the old highway numbers, and range from OR 103 to OR 454. In cases where the highway number was already in use by a different route, the first digit of the new route number was changed to 5 (e.g. Cape Arago Hwy No. 240, designated OR 540 in 2003). Most of these new route numbers are unsigned as of 2015. Two state highways lack route numbers: Century Drive Hwy No. 372 and Midland Hwy No. 420.

It provides outpatient services, inpatient facilities, intensive care and a 24-hour emergency care service for children referred by GPs and other specialists. It is managed by the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. The hospital originally stood on Dyke Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton. Local architect Thomas Lainson's red-brick and terracotta building, in the Queen Anne style, was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1881. It remained in use for more than a century before being replaced by a new building at the main Royal Sussex County Hospital site. The new facility opened in June 2007, and has won architectural awards for its innovative design. The future of the Dyke Road site has been uncertain since the move to the new premises was first considered in 2001; Lainson's buildings and their later additions were threatened with demolition until 2009, when a developer was refused planning permission to replace the hospital with flats. Brighton & Hove City Council's latest planning briefs state that any redevelopment of the site should incorporate Lainson's original building. History =Western Road and Dyke Road= Hospitals dedicated to the treatment of children have existed in England since the mid-19th century: the first opened in Liverpool in 1851. By this time, Brighton was a rapidly growing town with a history of proactively establishing social, educational and medical institutions. In response to a meeting at Brighton Town Hall on 23 June 1868, local doctor R.P.B. Taaffe founded the town's first children's hospital, the Brighton Hospital for Sick Children, at 178 Western Road on 3 August of that year. Two years later, it moved to the former Church Hill School, a disused building on Dyke Road; Bishop of Chichester Richard Durnford conducted the reopening ceremony on 14 July 1871. Although this had 20 beds in the main ward, an eight-bed ward for bone disorders and an isolation ward for infectious diseases, within ten years it was felt necessary to move to another larger building. Thomas Lainson, who entered practice in the early 1860s, was a prolific and eclectic local architect. By 1880, his works included residential terraces in the Italianate style, places of worship in diverse styles (Romanesque Revival and Neo-Byzantine), a High Gothic working men's club and an Italianate villa. His buildings often incorporated multicoloured brick and dressings of terracotta. In about 1881, he went into partnership with two of his sons, Thomas J. and Arthur, who worked together as Lainson & Sons. Lainson won the commission for the new hospital in 1880 by submitting a design for a Queen Anne style building of red brick and terracotta. His sons joined him in designing and building it; this lasted until 1881 and cost ¬£10,500 (¬£ in ), and the hospital was formally opened on 21 July 1881. The Prince and Princess of Wales and their daughters Princess Louise, Princess Victoria and Princess Maud were in attendance; Dr Taaffe changed the name of the hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children in honour of the Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark). The new building stood at the junction of Dyke Road and Clifton Hill in the Montpelier area of Brighton. The building was added to many times; none of these changes were by Lainson & Sons. Nurses' quarters were built in 1896; a two-storey extension, with isolation and outpatient facilities, opened in 1904, increasing the capacity to 114 patients; additional wings were added in 1928 and 1945 (the latter opened by Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth II); and the nurses' quarters became another ward in 1966. =Plans for a new hospital= The first proposal to relocate the hospital came in 2001, when the Secretary of State for Health Alan Milburn allocated ¬£28 million to move its services to the Royal Sussex County Hospital site in Eastern Road in the Kemptown area. The money was part of a ¬£1,100-million hospital-building programme which the Labour government intended to fund through the use of public‚Äìprivate partnerships. The scheme was put on hold for nearly a year until February 2002, when the government confirmed that ¬£25 million was available and permitted the NHS trust responsible for the Royal Alexandra (at the time, the Brighton Health Care NHS Trust) to seek a private finance partner. In August 2002, the trust put the contract for the new hospital's design and construction out to competitive tender. Applications were received from 26 companies; the trust selected a shortlist of four from these in October 2002. Architecture firm Building Design Partnership and the European division of Japanese company Kajima were selected for the design and construction processes respectively. =Recent history of the Dyke Road site= Thomas Lainson's former hospital building on Dyke Road was last used in 2007. Details of the new building were announced in January 2004‚Äîat which point it was also stated that Lainson's buildings on the Dyke Road site would be demolished. Three operating theatres, an intensive care unit, X-ray facilities and 100 beds were planned. Meanwhile, developers expressed interest in the Dyke Road site, hoping to acquire and demolish the hospital and redevelop the prime central location with flats. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey paid ¬£10 million for the site in December 2006, and planned to build a mixture of houses and flats (including some affordable housing); they submitted a planning application for a 149-unit development incorporating a doctor's surgery, but Brighton & Hove City Council refused planning permission in December 2008 and again (on appeal) in June 2009. The planning officer who made the decision stated that the proposed development was too large in scale for the site, affected nearby open space and appeared \\"bulky [and] overbearing\\". The majority of local residents wanted the old buildings to be retained, according to a locally produced survey earlier in 2006, and a residents' association applied to English Heritage for the granting of listed status, which would have given protection against demolition and significant alteration. This was not granted, because Lainson's original building had been altered so much that its original architectural character had been lost, but its situation within the Montpelier and Clifton Hill conservation area still gave some protection. (The Council's Conservation Area Character Statement of 2005 stated that the hospital was \\"an important part of Brighton life and a well known local landmark\\".) In March 2010, the council published a planning statement which required the main building (Lainson's original) to be retained as part of any future redevelopment of the site. Later buildings, such as the former nurses' accommodation, were not covered by this. Taylor Wimpey submitted new plans to retain Lainson's main building but use most of the site for housing. These were approved by Brighton and Hove City Council in February 2011. Work could not start, though, until the council reached agreement with the company over ¬£350,000 of funding towards educational and transport improvements. Several months later, when development had still taken place, the building was falling into decay and was reportedly close to collapse, as squatters and thieves regularly broke in to occupy the building and strip lead from the roof. This prompted the council to serve notice on Taylor Wimpey to tidy the site, make it secure and improve the appearance of the buildings. =Royal Sussex County Hospital site= Construction of the new hospital started in July 2004 and cost ¬£36 million. The new building opened in June 2007, and the Dyke Road site was officially closed on 22 June 2007. To make way for the new facilities, the Royal Sussex County Hospital's renal unit had to be demolished; it was rebuilt on top of the multi-storey car park. On 31 January 2012, comedian Steve Coogan opened a paediatric accident and emergency unit‚ÄîSoutheast England's first such department dedicated to children. The accident and emergency department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital had previously treated both adults and children. The new hospital won an award for the \\"Operational Project with the Best Design\\" at the Public Private Finance Awards in 2008, and won the 2008 Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award‚Äîa government award sponsored by the Office of Government Commerce and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Judges considered that the design was cleverly executed on a difficult site, and incorporated elements appropriate to its seaside setting. As of , the Royal Alexandra Hospital is one of seven children's hospitals in Great Britain. Architecture The curved building has sea views and windows at \\"child height\\". Thomas Lainson's building of 1880‚Äì81 was in a Shavian interpretation of the Queen Anne style, which he and his sons used again in later buildings in the area (such as the Belgrave Hotel of 1882 and in their work on the Vallance Estate in Hove in the early 1890s). The three- storey building is mostly of red brick with some terracotta dressings. Lainson made extensive use of ornate decorative mouldings on the east-facing main fa√ßade, which is not symmetrical and has a Dutch gable. Another decorative feature was a cartouche which commemorated the Royal Family members present at the opening. The south-facing secondary fa√ßade has conventional gables, large chimneys and a pair of cupola-topped turrets at one end. Another local firm, Clayton & Black, added a colonnade on this side in 1906. In 1927, the north side was extended in a style which matched Lainson's work: W.H. Overton's design included gables with half-timbering and tile-hanging. The 1904 extension, consisting of isolation facilities and outpatients' accommodation, was in the Vernacular/Domestic style with half-timbered gables with jettying, prominent mullions and transoms to the bay windows, and a small tower. The new hospital, designed by Building Design Partnership, is in the form of an ark, and has a \\"nautical theme\\" appropriate to the seafront location. The exterior has curved corners and is clad in white precast concrete, intended to evoke the painted stucco which is closely associated with Brighton's seafront Regency architecture. The fenestration is irregular: many windows are at a low level to improve visibility for children. The building has a naturally lit central atrium. Patron Since 1954, the hospital's patron has been Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (styled Princess Alexandra of Kent until 1963).

Life and work Spendlove was born in Carlton in Nottinghamshire. He worked for British Railways for 35 years, and in 1963 was appointed Relief Station Master at Ely in Cambridgeshire. He retired from the railways in 1989 at the age of 50, to pursue a career in broadcasting. With David Croft he wrote and created a BBC TV comedy series, Oh, Doctor Beeching!, which ran on BBC One between 1995 and 1997. From 18 March 1989 until 6 May 2017, Spendlove worked for BBC Local Radio as the host of his long-running Saturday night music and phone-in show, which was simulcast from BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and also broadcast on the Eastern Counties radio stations, Radio Norfolk, Radio Suffolk, Radio Essex, BBC Three Counties Radio, Radio Northampton and Radio Kent. In January 1994, an Early day motion tabled in the House of Commons after a break in its broadcasting received a total of fifteen signatures. It was believed to be the longest continually running phone-in chat show on British Radio. He also presented in the afternoons on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire until 16 June 2017, his 78th birthday. Since then, the Saturday night show format has returned on and off. From 4 December 2017 to 25 March 2018, Spendlove returned to broadcast the show on Mildenhall, Suffolk based community station Zack FM, on Monday nights and later Sunday nights. From late 2018 to May 2020, the show was broadcast live, on and off, on selected Saturday and later Sunday evenings online, and had a dedicated Facebook page. Spendlove was awarded the MBE for \\"Services to Regional and Local Radio Broadcasting\\" in 2000. In 2016, the BBC was critical of his use of his show to gain support for a convicted Royal Marine murderer. Spendlove lives in Harston, Cambridgeshire with his wife Betty, who sat opposite him in the studio during his Saturday night show's entire run on the BBC. They married in November 1960.

History Founded in 1880, and for many years known as the Evening Argus, the newspaper is owned by Newsquest (since 1999, part of the US Gannett media group) which in 1996 bought the Argus and its sister Westminster Press titles from the provincial papers group's parent, the Pearson Group. The Argus reached a peak circulation of 100,000 in the early 1980s but, like most of its counterparts in the British regional press, has since experienced a considerable decline in sales. In the period December 2010 to June 2011, the paper had an average daily circulation of 24,949 but by the period January to June 2013, average daily sales had dropped to 16,622. For the period July to December 2017 average daily circulation had fallen to 10,581. In October 2012, the Argus's cover price was increased by 45% to 65p on weekdays and 85p on Saturday, taking readership to an all-time low, but attempting to make more money because of the increased cover price. Controversies In February 2018 the Argus was found by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) to have breached its Editors' Code of Practice with regard to a story which it had published the previous September. IPSO found that the newspaper had behaved in a discriminatory way in its reporting of a court case by describing the plaintiff as an \\"amputee\\" in a headline and referring to his disability in the body of the article, in spite of the fact that the crime of which he was accused was \\"plainly irrelevant to his physical disability\\". The committee found the reportage to be \\"a serious and unjustified breach of the Code\\" and was \\"extremely concerned\\" by the \\"serious failure in relation to both staff training and editorial oversight of material published by the newspaper.\\" Further, IPSO was \\"deeply concerned about the newspaper‚Äôs handling of the complaint\\" and found that \\"the newspaper‚Äôs decision to make its offer to remove the material conditional on the complainant agreeing not to pursue his complaint further, was not a suitable or satisfactory response.\\" As remediation, the newspaper was ordered to publish IPSO's findings both on its website and in its print edition. In March 2018, the paper was forced to publish an apology after it used the photograph of an unrelated man to illustrate a news story. In October 2018 Newsquest paid \\"a substantial sum\\" in compensation and legal costs to a Shoreham businessman whom the Argus had wrongly claimed was connected with the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing and falsely alleged was an \\"ISIS sympathiser\\". The complainant's barrister asserted that he had been caused \\"very great distress, anxiety and damage to his reputation\\". Following the High Court verdict, a Newsquest representative admitted the report was \\"wholly false\\" and apologised. In November 2018 the paper was forced to publish an apology after falsely reporting that a man had supplied drugs to Geordie Shore star Aimee Spencer before she fell to her death.

These roads fall into one of three categories: Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways. Interstate and U.S. Highways are continuous with surrounding states, while state highways are not (though Oklahoma and another state's department of transportation may coordinate numbering). The majority of the numbered highways within Oklahoma are maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT). The only exceptions are sections of Interstate 44 (I-44) and U.S. Highway 412 (US 412), which run along turnpikes maintained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA). (I-44 runs along the H.E. Bailey, Turner, and Will Rogers turnpikes; US 412 is signed along the Cimarron and Cherokee turnpikes.) Individual counties may establish a numbering system to apply to roads that they maintain. These highways are not listed here. State highways Oklahoma's state highways serve as the second-lowest tier on the Oklahoma road system. They are marked with a number contained inside an outline of the state, having been formerly marked inside a white circle in a black box until January 2006. SH-81 has not been issued for a state highway so that is not confused with US Highways and Interstates bearing the same number designation. SH-35 has been issued, but it is only for a short spur, far from I-35. SH-60, SH-62, SH-69, and SH-75 were once assigned but these designation have since been revoked. Other two-digit highways that have yet to be assigned include: SH-12, SH-13, SH-21, SH-41, SH-57, SH-61, SH-68, and SH-90. SH-40 was once issued, but was absorbed into U.S. Highway 177; see SH-40A. SH-41, which was an east-west route across west-central Oklahoma that began at the intersection of S.W. 29th and May Avenue in Oklahoma City and veered southwest to Mustang, Union City and Minco before continuing west through Binger, Eakly, Cordell and Sayre and then crossing the Texas border near Sweetwater, was redesignated as SH-152 over its entire length in 1955. Across the Texas Panhandle, the highway continues as TX-152 to Dumas, Texas. SH-61 had a strange east-west route across south-central Oklahoma that started at SH-13 (Now SH-3W). Where it headed south, passing through Vanoss and then to Roff, where it turned east to Fittstown. It then headed south with SH-99 until turning east again. The road turned north in Jessie. It went north until it turned back east north of Stonewall It turned east again until it ended on SH-48 in Luna. Many Oklahoma state highways have short spur routes connecting them to towns which lie off of the main route. Many times, these bear the same number as the parent highway, with a letter suffix. Some state highway spurs and loops from US highways have designations that are drawn from the parent US Highway designation. As higher-level roads replaced sections of some routes, those sections sometimes had their designation revoked. This led to some highways being fragmented, missing one or more sections in the middle of the road. There are also a few unrelated highways that are designated in completely different parts of the state with the same number.

The show was originally created by Graham Griffith, and first broadcast on September 17, 2001, to provide special coverage in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The show's popularity led to it becoming a standalone program, first broadcasting under the On Point name on 4 February 2002. It was originally a two-hour call-in show, but the show transitioned to its current one-hour format in October 2020. Tom Ashbrook Tom Ashbrook was the long-running host from 2002 to 2017. Prior to that he was a foreign editor at Boston Globe. Ashbrook hosted most weeks during his time with the show, but went on medical leave in November 2007, to undergo heart bypass surgery. He resumed full-time broadcasting January 2, when he discussed his medical journey in a show with his doctors and nurses. On November 5, 2014, Ashbrook announced a period of personal leave to care for his wife, Danielle, who had been suffering from cancer. She died the next day, November 6, 2014, at age 60. After nearly two months away, Ashbrook returned to On Point on January 2, 2015. Ashbrook was put on leave from On Point at the beginning of December of 2017, when a group of current and former WBUR employees alleged he created a \\"toxic and emotionally unsafe work environment\\" for staff through bullying and publicly humiliating colleagues. Specific allegations filed by initially 11 (and later \\"at least 23\\" ) staffers included \\"Tirades directed at young women in the studio, name-calling, belittling critiques of show ideas during meetings, 'creepy' sex talk, inappropriate touching, hugs and back or neck rubs after a dressing down.\\".

Election commentators included Donna Brazile, Tom Brokaw, Bob Shrum, Dana Milbank, Tony Fabrizio, Joe Klein, EJ Dionne, Pat Buchanan, Peter Hart, and Hendrik Hertzberg. The show traveled to both the Democratic and Republican conventions, broadcasting live in the morning and at night.  Time and location  On Point is broadcast live from Boston, Massachusetts on WBUR FM (90.9 MHz) from 10 to 11 a.m. ET, occupying the former time slot of The Connection, and repeats from 7 to 8 p.m. Friday's show almost always consists of an analysis of the previous week's news headlines. The Friday news analysis segments usually feature senior editor of The Atlantic Monthly and historian Jack Beatty as a news analyst, as well as, typically, two or three other guest commentators. Jane Clayson, former CBS morning anchor and correspondent, is commonly the show's fill-in host; NPR's Jacki Lyden, John Harwood, Anthony Brooks, Jessica Yellin, James Hattori, and Ray Suarez have also hosted. It is led by senior producer Karen Shiffman and directed by Eileen Imada. The On Point theme music, \\"Everything Is Alright\\", comes from the Four Tet album Pause.

They are often grown as an ornamental in front yards, parks, gardens, buildings etc. due to their bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. They are also known as Golden wonder tree, American cassia, Popcorn tree, Cassia excelsa, Golden shower tree or Archibald's cassia. The plant has become an invasive alien species in parts of Africa such as Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda after it was introduce for resources such as firewood as well as to help combat deteriorating ecosystems affected by deforestation and desertification. Currently, S. spectabilis is overtaking native tree species of forestry ecosystems around the world because of its ability to grow quickly.. Taxonomy and systematics S. spectabilis was long placed in Cassia, or in the non-monophyletic Cathartocarpus assemblage, or separated ‚Äì together with its relative Senna peralteana ‚Äì in Pseudocassia.

The plant can be used as a treatment for ringworm and skin diseases. After extracting a leaf on alcohol there was significant antifungal activity, which suggests it can be used with infections caused by Candida albicans. The plant is effective against food borne pathogen B. Senna spectabilis also produces several substances that we deem necessary for metabolism, in which they are also used as a medicine or pharmaceutical drug. Pharmaceuticals that can produce piperidine alkaloids, pentacyclic terpenoids, and anthraquinones. It is also used in both eastern and western traditional medicine treating several different diseases and symptoms. S. spectabilis is also used as a medicinal plant in Cameroon by traditional healers to treat epilepsy, constipation, insomnia, and anxiety. In a recent study, the anticonvulsant effects of S. sepctabilis was observed on mice undergoing seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES), pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and pilocarpine (PC). It was discovered that the mice undergoing PTZ induced seizures were protected 100% of the time when administered the lowest plant dose. In another experiment on differing doses, the plant offered protection up to 75% of the time on antagonized seizures induced by PC. The study concluded that Senna spectabilis contains anticonvulsant activity, most likely acting on the GABA complex receptor.Gisele Claudine Nkamguie Nkantchoua, Jacqueline Stephanie Kameni Njapdounke, Jean Jules Fifen, Germain Sotoing Taiwe, Lucie Josiane Ojong, Antoine Kavaye Kandeda, Elisabeth Ngo Bum, Anticonvulsant effects of Senna spectabilis on seizures induced by chemicals and maximal electroshock, Journal of Ethnopharmacology, Volume 212, 2018, Pages 18‚Äì28, Other non medical related uses, S. spectabilis is used in agroforestry as a shade tree. The species is useful for fodder, mulch, fuelwood, and as a source of honey. The heartwood is brown and the sapwood is white-ish. The wood is heavy, soft, and hard, when kept dry can be resistant to termites. For this reason S. spectabilis is often used for economic reasons. The wood is used for tool handles, boxes, furniture, lumber and other construction materials. The wood is also used as fuel wood and to make charcoal. Also, S. spectabillis was introduced to Africa as an ornamental and a boundary marker. It's not highly valued but it does produce good quality firewood. Senna spectabillis can invade disturbed forests, forest edges, and gaps where it can establish and suppress the regeneration of native species.https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/eafrinet/weeds/key/weeds/Media/Html/Senna_spectabilis_(Spectacular_Cassia).htm Fruits  Description  Senna spectabilis S. spectabilis is a shrub or deciduous tree that can grow anywhere from 15‚Äì20 ft in height and 15‚Äì20 ft in width. S. spectabilis have a rounded vase-shaped crown, which is dense and symmetrical. S. spectabilis is pollinated by bees and has a very fast growth rate. =Foliage= A rounded, evergreen foliage, arranged alternatively. The leaf type is odd-pinnately compound with pinnate leaf venation and 4‚Äì15 pairs of leaflets each growing up to be 7.5 cm. The leaves are green and yellow in color and remains as so year around. The leaf blades grow between 2‚Äì4 inches long and experience a circadian rhythm or nyctinasty, closing at night and opening at dawn. =Flower and fruit= Bright yellow inflorescence 10‚Äì50 cm long containing a corolla 3.5-4 cm in diameter with five unequal petals. The flowers are very showy producing elongated pod shaped fruits about 6‚Äì12 inches in length. The fruit is a dry dehiscent, black/brownish in color containing numerous flat brown seeds, 0.5 cm in diameter. =Trunk and branches= Multiple trunks with diameters of up to about 30 cm. The branches are droopy with smooth grey bark having horizontal markings. As the plant matures it develops many warts and broad vertical bands of lenticels . In the first year of development the stem is finely hairy.  Distribution  S. spectabilis ' is native from South America first found in eastern tropical Brazil and coastal Ecuador, eventually migrating throughout Central America as well as the West Indies in forests from up to 2000 m of altitude. ' Their habitats include rain forest, semi-deciduous and dry forest, montane forest, and dry valleys. The plant requires full sunlight and well-drained soil to grow. S. spectabilis can flourish in a variety of different soils from moist, clay, sand, loam, slightly alkaline, and acidic soils even in poor black cotton soils. However it has difficulties adapting to soils with high aerosol salt concentrations. There are no known diseases that affects the plant. Today the species can be found all around the world due to its invasive nature.

This species is sometimes called the Guyana pinktoe, common pinktoe, or South American pinktoe. The mature pinktoe tarantula has a dark-colored body and pinkish feet, hence its name. Juvenile specimens, however, have pinkish bodies and dark-colored feet. Pinktoe tarantulas undergo a reversal in their coloration as they approach adulthood at 4‚Äì5 years. They are sit-and-wait predators, with limited activity.1\\\\. J. L. Cloudsley‚ÄêThompsona & C. Constantinou. 1985. Diurnal rhythm of activity in the arboreal tarantula Avicularia avicularia (L.) (Mygalomorphae: Theraphosidae). Journal of Interdisciplinary Cycle Research. Retrieved January 25, 2012. Being arboreal species, they require a relatively tall habitat with plenty of climbing space in captivity. They require a lot of moisture, along with ample ventilation to prevent molds from developing. They have a short lifespan and usually live between 7-9 years. They are known to lure in their victims through the process of stationization, the act of remaining in a trance-like state until moment of attack. A full grown pinktoe tarantula can grow up to six inches in length. Their first reaction when threatened is usually to run or leap away, but they may react defensively if provoked (as with any theraphosid). Their venom is considered mild, even compared to other new-world tarantulas. Although this species is often rumoured to be communal, housing them in groups will almost inevitably lead to cannibalism over time.

Polygonal modeling is well suited to scanline rendering and is therefore the method of choice for real-time computer graphics. Alternate methods of representing 3D objects include NURBS surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and equation-based representations used in ray tracers.  Geometric theory and polygons  The basic object used in mesh modeling is a vertex, a point in three-dimensional space. Two vertices connected by a straight line become an edge. Three vertices, connected to each other by three edges, define a triangle, which is the simplest polygon in Euclidean space. More complex polygons can be created out of multiple triangles, or as a single object with more than 3 vertices. Four sided polygons (generally referred to as quads) and triangles are the most common shapes used in polygonal modeling. A group of polygons, connected to each other by shared vertices, is generally referred to as an element. Each of the polygons making up an element is called a face. In Euclidean geometry, any three non-collinear points determine a plane. For this reason, triangles always inhabit a single plane. This is not necessarily true of more complex polygons, however. The flat nature of triangles makes it simple to determine their surface normal, a three-dimensional vector perpendicular to the triangle's surface. Surface normals are useful for determining light transport in ray tracing, and are a key component of the popular Phong shading model. Some rendering systems use vertex normals instead of face normals to create a better-looking lighting system at the cost of more processing. Note that every triangle has two face normals, which point to opposite directions from each other. In many systems only one of these normals is considered valid ‚Äì the other side of the polygon is referred to as a backface, and can be made visible or invisible depending on the programmer‚Äôs desires. Many modeling programs do not strictly enforce geometric theory; for example, it is possible for two vertices to have two distinct edges connecting them, occupying exactly the same spatial location. It is also possible for two vertices to exist at the same spatial coordinates, or two faces to exist at the same location. Situations such as these are usually not desired and many packages support an auto-cleanup function. If auto-cleanup is not present, however, they must be deleted manually. A group of polygons which are connected by shared vertices is referred to as a mesh. In order for a mesh to appear attractive when rendered, it is desirable that it be non-self- intersecting, meaning that no edge passes through a polygon. Another way of looking at this is that the mesh cannot pierce itself. It is also desirable that the mesh not contain any errors such as doubled vertices, edges, or faces. For some purposes it is important that the mesh be a manifold ‚Äì that is, that it does not contain holes or singularities (locations where two distinct sections of the mesh are connected by a single vertex).  Construction of polygonal meshes  Although it is possible to construct a mesh by manually specifying vertices and faces, it is much more common to build meshes using a variety of tools. A wide variety of 3D graphics software packages are available for use in constructing polygon meshes. One of the more popular methods of constructing meshes is box modeling, which uses two simple tools: * The subdivide tool splits faces and edges into smaller pieces by adding new vertices. For example, a square would be subdivided by adding one vertex in the center and one on each edge, creating four smaller squares. * The extrude tool is applied to a face or a group of faces. It creates a new face of the same size and shape which is connected to each of the existing edges by a face. Thus, performing the extrude operation on a square face would create a cube connected to the surface at the location of the face. A second common modeling method is sometimes referred to as inflation modeling or extrusion modeling. In this method, the user creates a 2D shape which traces the outline of an object from a photograph or a drawing. The user then uses a second image of the subject from a different angle and extrudes the 2D shape into 3D, again following the shape‚Äôs outline. This method is especially common for creating faces and heads. In general, the artist will model half of the head and then duplicate the vertices, invert their location relative to some plane, and connect the two pieces together. This ensures that the model will be symmetrical. Another common method of creating a polygonal mesh is by connecting together various primitives, which are predefined polygonal meshes created by the modeling environment. Common primitives include: * Cubes * Pyramids * Cylinders * 2D primitives, such as squares, triangles, and disks * Specialized or esoteric primitives, such as the Utah Teapot or Suzanne, Blender's monkey mascot. * Spheres - Spheres are commonly represented in one of two ways: ** Icospheres are icosahedrons which possess a sufficient number of triangles to resemble a sphere. ** UV spheres are composed of quads, and resemble the grid seen on some globes - quads are larger near the \\"equator\\" of the sphere and smaller near the \\"poles,\\" eventually terminating in a single vertex. Finally, some specialized methods of constructing high or low detail meshes exist. Sketch based modeling is a user-friendly interface for constructing low-detail models quickly, while 3D scanners can be used to create high detail meshes based on existing real-world objects in almost automatic way. These devices are very expensive, and are generally only used by researchers and industry professionals but can generate high accuracy sub- millimetric digital representations.  Operations  There is a very large number of operations which may be performed on polygonal meshes. Some of these roughly correspond to real-world manipulations of 3D objects, while others do not. Polygonal mesh operations include: * Creations - Create new geometry from some other mathematical object ** Loft - generate a mesh by creating a shape along two or more profile curves ** Extrude - creates a surface by sweeping a profile curve or polygon surface along a straight or linear line ** Revolve - generate a mesh by revolving (rotating) a shape around an axis ** Marching cubes - algorithm to construct a mesh from an implicit function * Binary Creations - Create a new mesh from a binary operation of two other meshes ** Add - boolean addition of two or more meshes ** Subtract - boolean subtraction of two or more meshes ** Intersect - boolean intersection ** Union - boolean union of two or more meshes ** Attach - attach one mesh to another (removing the interior surfaces) ** Chamfer - create a beveled surface which smoothly connects two surfaces * Deformations - Move only the vertices of a mesh ** Deform - systematically move vertices (according to certain functions or rules) ** Weighted Deform - move vertices based on localized weights per vertex ** Morph - move vertices smoothly between a source and target mesh ** Bend - move vertices to \\"bend\\" the object ** Twist - move vertices to \\"twist\\" the object * Manipulations - Modify the geometry of the mesh, but not necessarily topology ** Displace - introduce additional geometry based on a \\"displacement map\\" from the surface ** Simplify - systematically remove and average vertices ** Subdivide - smooth a course mesh by subdividing the mesh (Catmull-Clark, etc.) ** Convex Hull - generate another mesh which minimally encloses a given mesh (think shrink-wrap) ** Cut - create a hole in a mesh surface ** Stitch - close a hole in a mesh surface * Measurements - Compute some value of the mesh ** Volume - compute the 3D volume of a mesh (discrete volumetric integral) ** Surface Area - compute the surface area of a mesh (discrete surface integral) ** Collision Detection - determine if two complex meshes in motion have collided ** Fitting - construct a parametric surface (NURBS, bicubic spline) by fitting it to a given mesh ** Point-Surface Distance - compute distance from a point to the mesh ** Line-Surface Distance - compute distance from a line to the mesh ** Line-Surface Intersection - compute intersection of line and the mesh ** Cross Section - compute the curves created by a cross-section of a plane through a mesh ** Centroid - compute the centroid, geometric center, of the mesh ** Center-of-Mass - compute the center of mass, balance point, of the mesh ** Circumcenter - compute the center of a circle or sphere enclosing an element of the mesh ** Incenter - compute the center of a circle or sphere enclosed by an element of the mesh  Extensions  Once a polygonal mesh has been constructed, further steps must be taken before it is useful for games, animation, etc. The model must be texture mapped to add colors and texture to the surface and it must be given a skeleton for animation. Meshes can also be assigned weights and centers of gravity for use in physical simulation. To display a model on a computer screen outside of the modeling environment, it is necessary to store that model in one of the file formats listed below, and then use or write a program capable of loading from that format. The two main methods of displaying 3D polygon models are OpenGL and Direct3D. Both of these methods can be used with or without a 3D accelerated graphics card.  Advantages and disadvantages  There are many disadvantages to representing an object using polygons. Polygons are incapable of accurately representing curved surfaces, so a large number of them must be used to approximate curves in a visually appealing manner. The use of complex models has a cost in lowered speed. In scanline conversion, each polygon must be converted and displayed, regardless of size, and there are frequently a large number of models on the screen at any given time. Often, programmers must use multiple models at varying levels of detail to represent the same object in order to cut down on the number of polygons being rendered. The main advantage of polygons is that they are faster than other representations. While a modern graphics card can show a highly detailed scene at a frame rate of 60 frames per second or higher, surface modelers, the main way of displaying non-polygonal models, are incapable of achieving an interactive frame rate (10 frame/s or higher) with a similar amount of detail. With sprites, another alternative to polygons, every required pose must be created individually, while a single polygonal model can perform any movement if the appropriate motion data is applied, and can be viewed from any angle.  File formats  A variety of formats are available for storing 3D polygon data. The most popular are: * .3ds, .max, which is associated with 3D Studio Max * .blend, which is associated with Blender * .c4d associated with Cinema 4D * .dae (COLLADA) * .dxf, .dwg, .dwf, associated with AutoCAD * .fbx (Autodesk former.

She is best known for being the co-creator (along with Tony Holland) of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, also working as a director and the first producer of the series.  Early career  London-born Smith became involved in television production when she directed the series Suspense in 1962. She went on to direct popular BBC shows such as Z Cars (in 1962) and Doctor Who (in 1966), for which she directed the stories The Smugglers and The Underwater Menace. In 1967 she directed an adaptation of The Railway Children with Jenny Agutter that was successful enough for it to lead to the fondly remembered 1970 film in which Agutter reprised her role of Roberta. While working on Z Cars she had met Tony Holland, who was a writer for the show. The two of them became an established producer/script-editor team and went on to work for the BBC's long-running hospital drama Angels (1975) from 1979 to 1983. = EastEnders = In 1983 the BBC contacted Smith and Holland to create a new popular bi-weekly serial drama. Two ideas were given to them, one about a caravan site, the other about a shopping arcade. Neither of them liked either of the ideas and demanded to be able to create something about what they knew‚Äîin the words of Smith‚Äî\\"London - today!\\" Together they came up with the idea of a serial set in the East End of London in a Victorian Square. When casting for the show, Smith had the guideline 'Only genuine Eastenders need apply'; it was this that gave her the idea for the name of the show, which would be called EastEnders after other names were rejected. Originally the show was to be called Eastenders, but Jonathan Powell, then Head of Drama at the BBC who had commissioned the show, made the tentative suggestion that the second \\"e\\" didn't look good on paper, and said that perhaps it should be capitalized. It was, for which Smith later said \\"...we were eternally grateful to him!\\" Traditionally, the end music to EastEnders begins with dramatic drums, but occasionally, especially when a character departs, a piano introduction is used. This is called Julia's Theme, after Julia Smith. Her final contribution to EastEnders, along with that of fellow creator Tony Holland, came in early 1989, amid a dispute with BBC bosses as to whether the character of Den Watts (played by Leslie Grantham) could ever return to the show after being shot and supposedly killed. The character would ultimately return to the series, having apparently survived the shooting, but Smith would not live to see this happen. =Eldorado= After the success of EastEnders, Smith and Holland collaborated again on the ill-fated BBC soap opera Eldorado. Holland created the series -- based on an original idea by Verity Lambert‚Äîand Smith was producer. Eldorado was produced by Lambert through her own company Cinema Verity Productions. The BBC obviously hoped that, after EastEnders, Smith and Holland could make drama gold again; however, the series was cancelled by the new controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob. Smith was blamed for the programme's shortcomings and was fired, which left her bitter towards the BBC, who she believed had not given Eldorado a chance to establish itself. Corinne Hollingworth took over as series producer after Smith left the show, but the series was ended after only one year. Death Following the demise of Eldorado, Smith retired from television work. She died of cancer in Kensington and Chelsea, London, in 1997. Several stalwart cast members of EastEnders, including Wendy Richard, attended her funeral.

Early life At the early age of 5 B√∂hler ‚Äì son of a family of craftspeople ‚Äì knew he wanted to become a surgeon.Inge Lehne: Lorenz B√∂hler. Die Geschichte eines Erfolges. Maudrich, Wien 1991, , p. 14. When he was a little boy he used to anatomize small birds and squirrels. On 6 December 1896 an X-ray of a hand by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen was published in Das interessante Blatt magazine. Lorenz B√∂hler saw it, cut it out and stuck it on his reading book. In 1896 he attended the f√ºrsterzbisch√∂fliche Knabenseminar in Brixen. After two years he left that school and attended secondary school in Bregenz, where he had to repeat the third grade. He graduated in 1905. He started his studies in medicine in 1905 at the University of Vienna. In 1910 he met his wife‚Äîa nurse‚Äîat Bregenz's hospital where he was working as a trainee. On 1 July 1911 B√∂hler became Doctor of Medicine at Vienna's University. Occupational activity until 1914 For a short time (1911‚Äîand then again in 1919, 1920) Lorenz B√∂hler was working at the clinic of surgeon Julius Hochenegg, who was his Professor at University. Hochenegg was one of the first doctors who had a department for accident surgery in his clinic. Since September 1911 B√∂hler worked as a physician on a ship for a few months, until he started to work at the garrison's hospital at Ragusa, where he became a k. u. k. substitute medical assistant. There he mostly did bacteriological work. In Autumn 1912 he became an assistant doctor at the hospital in Brixen and in April 1913 he became assistant doctor in Tetschen an der Elbe. In 1914 Lorenz B√∂hler went to an international surgeons congress in New York City. On his way to the congress he met Belgian doctor Albin Lambotte, who told him about surgical methods of fracture treatment. Afterwards B√∂hler spent some time at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, where he met Charles Horace Mayo. Mayo told him about the centres of fracture treatment at London and Liverpool. There was nothing like this in the German-speaking part of Europe. Mayo gave B√∂hler a commendatory letter for Arbuthnot Lane in London, who was one of the leading European doctors in surgical fracture treatment, but the breakout of World War I made it impossible for B√∂hler to visit Lane. B√∂hler's career during World War I Shortly after conscription B√∂hler wanted to work as a surgeon and so he did: From 1914‚Äì1916 he was working as a surgeon at the Divisions-Sanit√§ts- Anstalt Nr. 8 der Tiroler Kaiserj√§ger and in August 1916 he became the leading surgeon at a military hospital for minor casualties in Bozen. Though he wasn't allowed to treat shot fractures he managed to get soldiers with broken bones and was able to treat them very successfully so he finally was allowed to treat them and the military hospital was expanded to a special station for bone fractures and renamed \\"Spezialabteilung f√ºr Knochenschussbr√ºche und Gelenksch√ºsse\\". There Lorenz B√∂hler was able to realize some of his most groundbreaking ideas: everything got specialized and standardized, records were kept for later (statistic) analyses, the most important information got written on the plaster and the patients got sorted according to their kind of physical injury, and those who were able to do some kind of work had to help at the military hospital. B√∂hler had seen the chaos in other military hospitals where patients were lying higgledy-piggledy which of course caused difficulties in treating them. For a short time in 1918 B√∂hler was in Italian war captivity and had to work as an advisory surgeon for Italian military hospitals. The interwar years ‚Äì the founding of the AUVA hospital Webergasse 2‚Äì4: the AUVA-hospital in Vienna Back in Austria B√∂hler wanted to establish special stations for casualty treatments. Therefore, he approached the Arbeiterunfallversicherungsanstalt (AUVA) (labourer's accident insurance) in Vienna and tried to explain the (both medical and economic) advantages which it would have if the AUVA would have an own specialized hospital. Though the AUVA agreed with B√∂hler the project wasn't realized until 1925. The AUVA- hospital opened on 1 December 1925 in Vienna Webergasse 2‚Äì6. B√∂hler (meanwhile he was working as a surgeon in Bozen and Brixen) became the head of the hospital. B√∂hler's reputation as a surgeon increased, especially abroad, while some of his colleagues in Vienna rejected him. Encouraged by the American Medical Association of Vienna (A.M.A.) he wrote the first edition of his book on bone fractures and modern techniques to deal with them called Treatment of fractures ‚Äì which became his classic work ‚Äì in 1929. On 29 March 1930 B√∂hler was promoted to professor at the University of Vienna. There he was teaching surgery and accident treatment.Lorenz B√∂hler's personnel file, University of Vienna archive, Med. PA 52 Sch. 7 Bl. 2. On 3 August 1936 he became an associate Professor. B√∂hler during World War II Little is known about Lorenz B√∂hler's life during the Second World War. On 25 May 1938 he became a member of the NSDAP (No. 6.361.999).Peter Voswinkel (Ed.): Biografisches Lexikon der hervorragenden √Ñrzte der letzten f√ºnfzig Jahre. Bd. 3 (Aba-Kom). Olms, Hildesheim u.a. 2002, , p. 147-148. In the summer of 1939 he was one of the 13 physicians of Vienna's University (7 professors and 6 private lecturers) who signed a protest letter against the suggested move of the A.M.A. from Vienna to London claiming \\"... that we the undersigned, know of not one case of persecution of a professor for his racial or religious adherence. ... It could rather be said that by the removal of certain influences a trend of charlatanism, which was beginning to damage the reputation of the Vienna medical clinics in the eyes of serious medical men, was eliminated\\".Ebenda, S. 147.Michael Hubenstorf: Medizinische Fakult√§t 1938‚Äì1945.

During World War II B√∂hler was inter alia working as an advisory surgeon for the Wehrmacht and at the Rudolfspital in Vienna, where he was the head of the surgery department and of a specialized military hospital for bone fractures. After 1945 B√∂hler was one of the scientists who continued a successful career as Professor (in 1954 he became a professor) and physician (publishing many medical papers), despite his membership in the Nazi Party. He remained the head of the AUVA-hospital Until 1963. His son J√∂rg B√∂hler, also a surgeon, was the head of the AUVA-hospital from 1970 to 1983.  B√∂hler's treatment principles  Exlibris showing his book \\"Die Technik der Knochenbruchbehandlung\\" (‚ÄûTreatment of Fractures‚Äú) and patients doing work out in an exercise room. B√∂hler's aim was to: *save life *save the part of the body *save its function. This should be achieved by: *a fast diagnosis *painless adjusting *immobilize the injured body part *active movement of all other body parts but trying to avoid causing pain. B√∂hler rejected the methods of treatment which had been popular at this time: electricity, hot air and massage.

The new building for the Accident Hospital opened in 1972, and was named after him (Emergency Hospital Vienna Lorenz B√∂hler).Unfallkrankenhaus Lorenz B√∂hler (in German). A street in Vienna's 20th District (Brigittenau) was also named for him. He been an honorary member of 33 worldwide associations.Voswinkel (2002), p. 148.

Medical specialist printers refused to publish it, so B√∂hler asked the bookseller Wilhelm Maudrich (jun.) to help him. B√∂hler had to pay the printing cost and finally the book ‚Äì though it was criticized by some of B√∂hlers colleagues ‚Äì became a top seller. Wilhelm Maudrich then became a medical specialist printer Verlag Maudrich. It was translated into eight languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Hungarian, Polish and Chinese.

History The parish was established by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco in 1900 and describes itself as \\"an inclusive Catholic community ‚Äì embracing all people of good faith ‚Äì Catholics as well as those people interested in learning about the Catholic experience ‚Äì regardless of their background, gender, race, social status or sexual orientation.\\" In The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, Randy Shilts mentions the church several times. The church was later vandalized by anti-Proposition 8 protesters, although many churchgoers were opposed to the ballot initiative. For many years, Most Holy Redemer was the home of Father William Young, one of the very few priests in the Bay Area qualified to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Father Young celebrated this weekdays at Most Holy Redeemer, and each Sunday at St. Vincent's Holy Rosary Chapel in Marinwood. Ministry to LGBT people and AIDS outreach In the 1980s, the neighborhood was deteriorating and the parish with it. Property values fell and a largely gay population moved in. Seeing the change in the neighborhood, Archbishop John R. Quinn appointed Fr. Tony McGuire as pastor of the church in 1983. McGuire brought together the largely older women who made up most of the remaining congregation and the few gay men who joined the parish. Together they began an outreach to the new gay population of the neighborhood. As the AIDS epidemic hit the gay community, the parish began providing services to those in need. The parish paired parishioners with people suffering from AIDS in the neighborhood to give them rides to the doctors, help around he house, or to meet other needs. The older women in the parish were instrumental in this ministry. It became a place \\"that helped save souls and helped save lives.\\" In 1986, a scroll was begun with the names of parishioners who had died of AIDS. Framed photos of some of them line the church. Quinn regularly visited this parish, especially during the annual 40 Hours Vigil held throughout the 1980s in support of those who were HIV-positive and their caregivers. , the AIDS support group is active again, though it is smaller than it was in the 1980s.

The band was formed in 1979 in Droitwich, England, by guitarist Nick Bowcott. History =Early years (1979‚Äì1984)= The band formed in Worcestershire and initially featured Paul de Mercado on vocals. Their first album demo tape was called Bleed 'Em Dry and had an album's worth of material. After developing a following in the north west and Yorkshire they caught the attention of Heavy Metal records, who added a re-recorded version of The Reaper from the demo. A positive write up in the Kerrang! 'Armed and Dangerous' section preceded a breakup of the initial lineup, with only Nick Bowcott remaining. He recruited Dave Wanklin on bass, Lee Harris on Drums and most importantly, Steve Grimmett on vocals. This lineup won a 1982 Battle of the Bands competition featuring over 100 bands, winning studio time to demo new material. Grimmett was then the unofficial vocalist for Cheltenham's Chateaux, who were signed to Darryl Johnston's Ebony Records label, so he handed them the Grim Reaper demo tape and the band was signed. Their debut album was See You in Hell. The album was released in 1984 and was distributed worldwide through RCA Records. =Commercial success (1985‚Äì1986)= Grim Reaper soon became readily identifiable with Bowcott's guitar work and lead vocalist Steve Grimmett's head voice vocals. Their successful world tour included a support show at Texxas Jam playing to over 20,000 people. Their 1985 follow-up, Fear No Evil, showed improvement on the production front and also enjoyed moderate success in both the United States and Europe. =Legal battles and later years (1987‚Äì1988)= Legal battles with Ebony Records delayed the release of the band's third album Rock You to Hell by almost two years. The album was released directly through RCA Records in 1987. However, by this time Grim Reaper's melodic heavy metal sound had fallen out of favor as much of the metal market moved toward heavier fare like thrash metal and speed metal. Even the major label distribution and popular video for the title track could not save the band. With the production of their fourth studio album (reportedly to be called Nothing Whatsoever to Do with Hell) about to start, another round of legal action from Ebony Records effectively dealt the death blow to Grim Reaper, subsequently disbanding in 1988. =Side projects (1988‚Äì2006)= Grimmett went on to front Onslaught and Lionsheart, as well as perform on several tribute albums. Bowcott became a freelance music writer, and later staff contributor, for publications like Circus and Guitar World. Bowcott also worked with Marshall Amplification's United States division. He also played in the band Barfly who recorded an album with Jack Ponti producing and Michael Wagener mixing for RCA records. =Current (2006‚Äìpresent)= In 2006, Eddie Trunk announced on Metal Mania that the band has reformed. The \\"original\\" lineup of Grim Reaper (without Nick Bowcott) played the Keep It True VI festival in Lauda-K√∂nigshoffen on 8 April 2006. The band played the annual MetalBrew festival in London's Mill Hill on Saturday 18 July 2009. Later they were scheduled to play at the Play it Loud IV in Bologna, Italy, in September 2009. The festival was then cancelled when the promoter forfeited, but the band (urged on by a crowd of fans who had already bought tickets) managed to play the date along with a number of originally billed acts (as a single-day event instead of a weekend-spanning one). In 2008 Derek \\"train wreck\\" Smallstick quit. It seems that it was a long time coming. His major complaint was that his instrument, the triangle, was constantly buried in the mix on studio recordings and live appearances. He would often be heard complaining and screamimg, in his words; \\"Whats the point?!\\". The band didn't realize he had quit until 2010, further adding insult to injury. The band made a successful appearance at the British Steel festival in Bolognia Italy in November 2010 at the Estragon venue on a bill that included other classic bands of the NWoBHM era - Diamond Head, Girlschool, Demon and Angelwitch. They also played at the Academy Birmingham with the band Jameson Raid. The current line-up continues to tour the UK and Europe. They did a short tour of Greece and Cyprus in November 2011 and released the Limited Edition \\"Live in Europe 2011\\". Festival appearances in 2012 included Sweden's \\"Muskelrock\\" and headlining Germany's Sword Brothers. In spring 2013, Steve Grimmett's Grim Reaper released a new studio album, their first since 1987. The band were headliners of that year's British Steel festival in London in June but had to pull out at the last minute. and co-headliners of Belgium's Heavy Sound Festival in November with Tokyo Blade. More European Festivals and a US tours followed in the coming years. In April 2014, Grim Reaper played their first show in the US since 1987, joined by original guitarist Nick Bowcott, and featured several tracks from the forthcoming album, From Hell. On 17 January 2017 Grimmett was hospitalized following a show at Piedrahits & Pedro Moncayo in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Surgery followed, which was unsuccessful in defeating an infection in his right leg, so a portion of this leg was amputated on 18 January 2017. The band continues to play, and played an emotional headlining set at Hard Rock Hell's NWOBHM Christmas gig in Sheffield in December that year. On 25 July 2019 it was announced that Grim Reaper will be releasing an album of all new material in October 2019. the album titled At The Gates is due on 11 October 2019 with a special album launch show to follow the next night, 12 October, at London's Boston Music Rooms.

They are known as the Duor by other communities occupying the savanna lands of the White Nile. The Bari speak the Bari language as a mother tongue, which belongs to the Nilotic family. Overview Late 1870s portrait of Bari man Bari homestead late 1870s The Bari of the Nile are sedentary agro-pastoralist. They exploit the savanna lands along the river Nile, and up to 40 miles east and west of the Nile. The Bari economy is based on subsistence mixed farming; their domestic livestock (small and large) are mainly raised for supplementing food, but mostly as a socio-economic and financial investment. Notably, livestock are exchanged as gifts in marriages, and other social functions or sacrificed in celebrations, and funerals; and whenever the need arises they are sold for cash. The Bari are consistently under pressure: now from modern urbanization annexing their green lands and infusing different cultures into their lifestyles; and historically the Baris have been devastated by slave traders, and forced by Belgians (especially from the Lado Enclave) into labor camps and used as porters to carry ivory tusks to the Atlantic coast. The two Sudanese Civil Wars (1955‚Äì1973; 1983‚Äì2005) have also affected the Bari social, economic and financial dynamics. War (intertribal or resisting foreigners) is not alien to Bari history. Generally, the Bari have co-existed well with the neighboring ethnic groups, but have had to pick up arms to defend their land against slave traders, and plundering warriors. There is documentation of Bari resistance against invasion by Dinka, Azande (Zande), and numerous encounters with Turkish slave traders. Traditionally the Baris believe in one almighty God and existence of powerful spirits (good and evil). Today the Bari's demography is made up of Christians (Catholics and Protestants), Muslims, and followers of traditional religions (not organized). In the past it was a fashion among the Bari to undergo initiation ceremonies. Both boys and girls subjected themselves to removal of lower front teeth. The girls, in addition got tattoos: around the belly area, the flank, the back, and the face (on the temple) in the form of arrow shapes, or simple flowers. Along the banks of the Nile, in the heart of the Bari land, lies the historical villages of Mongalla, Lado, Gondokoro (Kondokoro), and Rejaf (Rageef). The capital city of South Sudan, the town of Juba, is also in the Bari land, situated ten miles to the south of Gondokoro, and seven miles to the north of Rejaf. Origin of the Bari Based on Bari folklore, the Bari people settled in their current lands prior to the end of the grand trans-migration in Africa. By the time the Luo ethnic groups invaded and migrated through the Bari lands about 1650, the Bari were already sedentary agro-pastoralists, living, and trading with the neighboring ethnic groups. Bari forced into slavery The second Expedition to discover the source of the White Nile entered the Bari lands on 24 January 1841. Unfortunately with this progress in the quest for knowledge, came undesirable invaders in the form of European and Turkish traders looking for slaves and ivory. This was the first time Bari encountered Europeans travellers. The Bari were lucky in this encounter, as the Turkish army assigned to protect the Nile explorers behaved, unlike the brutality they unleashed on the ethnic groups (Mondari, Dinka, Shilluk) to the north of the Bari, Pojulu, Kakwa to the South and Kuku to the South-East. However, subsequent expeditions were different. The third expedition (1841‚Äì42) to discover the source of the White Nile also discovered that Ivory was abundant in the Bari area. From thence onwards, the rush for ivory tusks in the White Nile valley escalated. Initially, both European and Arab traders began sponsoring trips to Gondokoro for ivory. And for a decade the Bari freely sold ivory tusks and other artefacts to the traders without intimidation, and no incidents of slavery was reported by that point in time. In April 1854, the peaceful relationship between the traders/explorers and the Bari came to an end when a Turkish trader, without provocation, fired his guns into a crowd of Bari at Gondokoro. Accordingly, the Bari mounted a counterattack that was devastating to both sides. Subsequent to this the Bari became defensive and less friendly, and the traders (mostly Arabs, and Turks) resorted to violent means to procure ivory tusks, but also started taking people (young men and women) as slaves. Girls were raped, or taken as wives by force. Some of the merchants even built fortified depots near Gondokoro where people were kept awaiting shipment down the White Nile. Diaries of European missionaries in the region, indicate that in the market of Cairo (Egypt), the number of slaves to be sold to Europe from the White Nile area increased from 6,000 between 1858 and 1862, to approximately 12,000-15,000 per annum. These numbers reflected mostly, Bari, Dinka, and Mundari; but also included people of other ethnic groups neighboring the Bari, and beyond were hunting for elephant tusks was intense during that time. By 1863 when Sir Samuel White Baker arrived at Gondokoro, also on an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile, boats of buccaneers (even one flying an American flag) were anchoring at Gondokoro, with the sole purpose of picking up slaves to the new world. By 1865 about 3000 slaves at any one time could be found waiting at Gondokoro to be carried down the Nile. Baker returned in 1869 with the express purpose of stamping out the slave trade. By this time, the Bari people and land were already devastated. Bari folklore tells us of how long ago the land flanking the Nile was full of strings of villages spread out to the horizon, as far as the eye could see. Baker concurs, in his book \\"Ismailia\\" (1874), that this had been so when he first visited the area. However he describes how, by the time of his next expedition, the slave traders had reduced the Bari villages to a miserable few. Neither could he obtain co-operation from the Bari, who had been persuaded by Abou Saood, the chief slaver of Agad and Company, who had a government monopoly for trade and slaving, that it was in their best interests to help the slavers and hinder Baker. Ever since then, recovery has been difficult, considering also the fact that the civil wars in 1955-1973; and 1983-2005 have further taken their toll on the Bari. Courtship and marriage In the past, it was not uncommon for the Bari to use intermarriage to form bonds between two families. Although these arrangements were sometimes made when the children were very young, the bride price was not necessarily paid until the betrothed children reached marrying age. Today, marriage among the Bari more often involves a period of courtship followed by consent of the families involved. After a period of courtship, the male suitor usually declares his intent to marry (nyara in Bari) by presenting himself at the house of the girl's parents, accompanied by a few close relatives and friends. Before the wedding ceremony (budu, typically several months later), the families meet in the bride's parents' house to negotiate the bride price that the bridegroom is obligated to offer; the parents of the bride and bridegroom are never directly involved in these negotiations, though they may be involved indirectly and behind the scenes. Because the Bari have long been agro- pastoralists, the bride price is traditionally paid in the form of live animals. A typical bride price might be composed of two dozen cattle and 40 head of sheep and goats. When the use of animals is too difficult, such as in the case of drought or natural disaster, bride prices in the form of cash may also be acceptable. Behaviors considered disrespectful may increase the bride price during negotiations (though it is also possible for civil courts to get involved); these can include premarital sex, eloping, and aggression towards in-laws. Once the negotiations are successful, both families bless the marriage and commence in a feast that involves drinking and dancing. After the feast, the bridegroom returns home alone, but after about two weeks, the bride arrives to take charge of her house. For Bari who have converted to Christianity, an additional step occurs wherein the marriage also receives a church blessing. Ideally, this would occur before the husband and wife begin living together. However, because of the financial burden of having both a Bari traditional wedding feast and a Christian wedding ceremony, the trend has been to first have the traditional feast and then put off the Christian wedding for a year or longer while the couple saves up money for the occasion. This can be problematic when couples do not also wait to have children, which may be perceived as producing children out of wedlock. While the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) declaration opened the door for adaptation of some African traditional practices into the church, this has not yet led to the formation of a single wedding ceremony for Bari Christians. Bari language The Bari people speak the Bari language as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Eastern Nilotic subdivision of the Nilo-Saharan family. Bari is a tone language. It has vowel harmony, subject-verb-object word order, and agglutinative verbal morphology with some suppletion. References *Crabites, Pierre.

The Delaware Department of Transportation is responsible for maintaining numbered roads in Delaware. State routes in Delaware use the circular highway shield. Delaware's numbering system mirrors that of U.S. Highways in that odd numbered highways travel north-south and even numbered routes go east-west. The numbers increase in value as one goes south and west respectively. There are some exceptions, however, mainly with routes from other states keeping their number as they enter Delaware, hence breaking the pattern. __TOC__ History The first numbered routes in Delaware came in 1925 with the designation of the U.S. Highway System, in which US 13, US 40, and US 113 were legislated to run through the state. In 1930 and again in 1932, the Delaware State Highway Department recommended giving numbers to state roads to supplement the existing U.S. Highway System. By 1936, Delaware began assigning numbers to state routes. In 1956, the Interstate Highway System was created, with under 40 miles of Interstate highway legislated in New Castle County.

Established by an occupation of mohawk warrior's in the late 1970s, it is a rare case in which an indigenous people reclaiming land from the United States succeeded. Issues of sovereignty and governmental relations have not been settled. History In May 1974 traditionalist Mohawks repossessed land near Old Forge, New York, occupying Moss Lake, a girls' camp. They claimed the land under the concept that it had been part of their historic territory in the area, and that New York had made an illegal treaty in 1797 when purchasing land from their leader Joseph Brant.\\"Indians Seeking Support for Their Land Claims\\", The New York Times, 15 Dec 1975, accessed 27 Feb 2010 These Mohawk had left the Akwesasne, Kahnawake, and other reservations to rebuild traditional lives. The land dispute (as Altona residents and government objected to the Mohawk claim of sovereignty) has not been fully settled.Gail Landsman, \\"Ganienkeh: Symbol and Politics in an Indian/White Conflict\\", American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 87, No. 4 (Dec., 1985), pp. 826-839, accessed 27 Feb 2010 The action was related to rising Native American activism, and specific land claims being filed against New York State by separate nations of the Iroquois. As allies of the defeated British, they had been forced to cede their historic lands to the state after the American Revolution, but the US Senate had never ratified the treaty, making it invalid under the constitution. Some believe that the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua give the Iroquois nations continuing rights to land in the present-day state. The Oneida won a lands claim case, and others continued in negotiation in the late 20th century. At the same time, the founding of Ganienkeh was related to Mohawk local issues, as some families wanted to leave the reservation environment. They found it had problems with alcohol and substance abuse, among other issues. Gail Guthrie Valaskakis, Indian Country: Essays on Contemporary Native Culture, Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2005, p.57, accessed 27 Feb 2010 The three-year armed occupation of the camp ended in 1977 after nearly 200 negotiation sessions with New York state leaders. The Mohawk agreed to move to the territory at Miner Lake, which was offered by New York State through an intermediary trust. Unlike at the ten reservations within the borders of the state, in which federally recognized tribes have a relation with the federal government and the state has no authority over them, the jurisdictional relationships between the tribe and New York have not been defined at this territory. By 1990, the Mohawk still prohibited outsiders from entering the territory.SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, \\"Standoff Ends, but Not Mohawk Defiance\\", The New York Times\\", 14 Apr 1990, 27 Feb 2010 This became the settlement of Ganienkeh, with originally about 25 families, about from the Canada‚ÄìUS border.

The people claim that the Two Row Wampum (Guswhenta) guarantees Ganienkeh the right to exist as a sovereign entity within the international community. They note that as a sovereign people they may not be taxed by New York or the federal government.Suzanne Moore, \\"Ganienkeh must be treated as sovereign, spokesman insists\\", Press Republican News, 18 Apr 2005, on Infoshop News, accessed 25 Feb 2010 In 1990 Ganienkeh introduced tax-free bingo, and its 1500-person hall is often filled to capacity. This activity has generated income which the community has invested in economic development projects. (See below.) They also sell cigarettes tax free, thus underselling local retailers. They established the Ganienkeh Holistic Center, which provides classes and education to everyone in the larger community. They also opened the nine-hole Ganienkeh Golf Course, available to players for a fee. These businesses are communally operated for the benefit of the Territory. Through regular convened community meetings, every resident of Ganienkeh may participate in the day-to-day government of the community.

The Egyptians attacked the settlement several times throughout May 19 and May 20, but failed to capture it. A final attack was launched on May 23, in which the Egyptians succeeded in capturing part of Yad Mordechai, following which the Israeli defenders withdrew. Yad Mordechai finally fell to the Egyptians on May 24 after hours of bombardment of the vacated kibbutz. The kibbutz residents, aided by twenty Hagannah fighters, imposed a five-day delay on the Egyptians. This gave Israeli forces time to prepare for the Egyptians' northward advance, and they succeeded in halting the Egyptian advance at Ad Halom less than a week later. Background Yad Mordechai is a small kibbutz in southern Israel, founded in the 1930s and renamed in 1943 after Mordechaj Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The kibbutz, perched on a hill, dominated the coastal road midway between Gaza and Majdal (today Ashkelon). Egypt had dispatched an expeditionary force of around 10,000 men under the command of Major General Ahmad Ali al-Mwawi to Palestine in April 1948. Mwawi had separated his forces into two parts, one to march towards Jerusalem, the other to advance up the coast to Tel Aviv. The \\"Yad Mordechai\\" Kibbutz children were evacuated by these improvised armored cars, only hours before the Egyptian attack on 19/5/1948 The Egyptians had bypassed several settlements along their route of advance, but on reaching Yad Mordechai on May 16, Mwawi decided that the settlement was too large and well defended to be simply bypassed. The Egyptians had the benefit of armor, artillery and air support. They also mustered 2,500 soldiers for the assault, far outnumbering the commune's 130 defenders. An assembly of the kibbutz members decided on the evacuation of the women and children. On the night of May 18‚Äì19, a small Israeli armored column reached the kibbutz and extracted its 92 children. Left behind were 110 members (twenty of them women) and two squads of Palmachniks, equipped with light weapons, a medium machine gun and a PIAT hand-held anti- tank weapon. Battle Kibbutz members at a military briefing in Yad Mordechai (Abba Kovner standing at right) The Egyptians prepared for their assault for two days. Just after dawn on May 19, two battalions of infantry and one armored battalion attacked the village with artillery support. The Egyptians succeeded in breaching the perimeter fence, but after three hours of heavy fighting, were repulsed, leaving behind dozens of dead; the kibbutz suffered five dead and eleven wounded. Cairo radio announced prematurely that the settlement had fallen. The following day the Egyptians launched several more attacks (four according to Pollack, seven according to Morris), all of which were repulsed. Thirteen more Israelis died and twenty were wounded; dozens of Egyptians died as well. That night the Palmach sent in a platoon of reinforcements, including six deserters from the British military, with another PIAT and three machine guns. The Egyptians were hampered by the ineffectiveness of their artillery, and the difficulty in coordinating infantry and armor. After the attacks on May 20, the Egyptians reorganized as Mwawi improved the coordination between his forces. The Egyptians spent May 21‚Äì22 shelling the kibbutz. The Egyptian air force prevented a relief column from reaching the site. The settlement's buildings were leveled and the defenders had become \\"inhabitants of caves and tunnels\\". By May 22, with dozens of wounded, the defenders were pleading for permission to withdraw. The final Egyptian attack on May 23 saw the armor providing much better support for the infantry, and the Egyptians occupied a part of the settlement. At night, the Israeli defenders, exhausted from the fighting and low on ammunition, withdrew from the settlement. The Israeli withdrawal was unknown to the Egyptians and the following day, they opened up with a four-hour artillery barrage on the now empty kibbutz. Following the barrage, they occupied the settlement, ending the battle. Aftermath The Israeli delaying action at Yad Mordechai bought the newly established Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) time to organize a defensive line against the northward Egyptian drive toward Tel Aviv. On November 5, in the days following Operation Yoav, Israeli forces retook the ruins of the kibbutz.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 335. The village grew from the earlier settlement of Dam (still inhabited, with a number of houses and farms) at the conjunction of Perrydale and Damdale. There is an inn, a church and a primary school.Peak Forest CofE Primary School Its name probably derives from the Forest of High Peak. The village is at the heart of the old royal forest and was formerly known as Chamber of Campana. The nearby Chamber Farm or Chamber Knoll may have been the exact location of the residence and meeting place of local forest officials. Its church is dedicated to 'Charles, King & Martyr' (King Charles I of England, executed in 1649).Peak Forest, Genuki, accessed 1 January 2009 First erected in 1657, it was replaced in 1878 as a gift from the Duke of Devonshire. Until an Act of Parliament was passed in 1754 its minister was able to perform marriages without the need for reading the banns, and the village was known as the Gretna Green of Derbyshire. The Peak Forest Canal, although originally aiming for the limestone quarries in Great Rocks Dale just to the south of the village, never reached nearer than Buxworth, seven miles away, where it terminates at Bugsworth Basin. Instead, a horse-drawn tramway, the Peak Forest Tramway, was constructed in the late 18th century to connect the canal with the quarries between Dove Holes and Peak Forest. The original limestone-carrying purpose of the canal was replaced long ago by the Great Rocks mineral railway line serving the quarries around Buxton and joining the Manchester‚ÄìSheffield line, via the diverging Chapel Milton Viaduct over the Black Brook valley at Chapel Milton (between Chapel-en-le-Frith and Chinley). Its railway station (now closed) was built by the Midland Railway, two miles away at Small Dale. This was on its extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, part of the main Midland Line from Manchester to London. It was also the northern junction for the line from Buxton. Stage 1 of the Peak District Boundary Walk runs from Buxton to Peak Forest.

It tolerates a tropical lowland climate better than its relatives Annona reticulata and Annona cherimola (whose fruits often share the same name) helping make it the most widely cultivated of these species. Annona squamosa is a small, semi-(or late) deciduous, much branched shrub or small tree to tall similar to soursop (Annona muricata). Description Flower Seedling Branches The fruit of A. squamosa (sugar-apple) has sweet whitish pulp, and is popular in tropical markets. ;Stems and leaves: Branches with light brown bark and visible leaf scars; inner bark light yellow and slightly bitter; twigs become brown with light brown dots (lenticels ‚Äì small, oval, rounded spots upon the stem or branch of a plant, from which the underlying tissues may protrude or roots may issue). :Thin, simple, alternate leaves occur singly, to long and to wide; rounded at the base and pointed at the tip (oblong- lanceolate). Pale green on both surfaces and mostly hairless with slight hairs on the underside when young. The sides sometimes are slightly unequal and the leaf edges are without teeth, inconspicuously hairy when young. :Leaf stalks are to long, green, and sparsely pubescent. ;Flowers: Solitary or in short lateral clusters of 2‚Äì4 about long, greenish-yellow flowers on a hairy, slender long stalk. Three green outer petals, purplish at the base, oblong, to long, and to wide, three inner petals reduced to minute scales or absent. Very numerous stamens; crowded, white, less than long; ovary light green. Styles white, crowded on the raised axis. Each pistil forms a separate tubercle (small rounded wartlike protuberance), mostly to long and to wide which matures into the aggregate fruit. :Flowering occurs in spring-early summer and flowers are pollinated by nitidulid beetles.McGregor, S.E. Insect Pollination Of Cultivated Crop Plants USDA, 1976 Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.Walker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1-130. ;Fruits and reproduction: Aggregate and soft fruits form from the numerous and loosely united pistils of a flower which become enlarged and mature into fruits which are distinct from fruits of other species of genus (and more like a giant raspberry instead). :The round or heart-shaped greenish yellow, ripened aggregate fruit is pendulous on a thickened stalk; to in diameter with many round protuberances and covered with a powdery bloom. Fruits are formed of loosely cohering or almost free carpels (the ripened pistels). :The pulp is white tinged yellow, edible and sweetly aromatic. Each carpel containing an oblong, shiny and smooth, dark brown to black, to long seed. Distribution Annona squamosa is native to the tropical Americas and West Indies, but the exact origin is unknown. It is now the most widely cultivated of all the species of Annona, being grown for its fruit throughout the tropics and warmer subtropics, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan; it was introduced to southern Asia before 1590. It is naturalized as far north as southern Florida in the United States and as south as Bahia in Brazil, Bangladesh, and is an invasive species in some areas. ;Native :Neotropic ::Caribbean: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Puerto Rico, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Virgin Islands. ::Central America: El Salvador Guatemala ::Northern South America: Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, Venezuela ::Western South America: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru ::Southern South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay ;Current (naturalized and native) :Neotropic ::Caribbean: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Florida, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Puerto Rico, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Virgin Islands. ::Pacific: Samoa, Tonga ::North America: Mexico ::Central America: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama ::Northern South America: French Guiana, Guyana, Venezuela ::Western South America: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru ::Southern South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay :Afrotropic: Angola, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zanzibar, Kenya :Australasia: Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands :Indomalaya: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam :Palearctic: Cyprus, Greece, Lebanon, Malta, Israel Climate and cultivation Like most species of Annona, it requires a tropical or subtropical climate with summer temperatures from to , and mean winter temperatures above . It is sensitive to cold and frost, being defoliated below and killed by temperatures of a couple of degrees below freezing. It is only moderately drought-tolerant, requiring at least 700 mm of annual rainfall, and will not produce fruit well during droughts. It will grow from sea level to and does well in hot dry climates, differing in its tolerance of lowland tropics from many of the other fruit bearers in the Annona family. It is quite a prolific bearer, and it will produce fruit in as little as two to three years. A five-year-old tree can produce as many as 50 sugar apples. Poor fruit production has been reported in Florida because there are few natural pollinators (honeybees have a difficult time penetrating the tightly closed female flowers); however, hand pollination with a natural fiber brush is effective in increasing yield. Natural pollinators include beetles (coleoptera) of the families Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae and Scarabeidae. In the Philippines, the fruit is commonly eaten by the Philippine fruit bat (kabag or kabog), which then spreads the seeds from island to island. It is a host plant for larvae of the butterfly Graphium agamemnon (tailed jay). Uses In traditional Indian, Thai, and American medicine, the leaves are used in a decoction to treat dysentery and urinary tract infection. In traditional Indian medicine, they are also crushed and applied to wounds. In Mexico, the leaves are rubbed on floors and put in hens' nests to repel lice. Chemical constituents The diterpenoid alkaloid atisine is the most abundant alkaloid in the root. Other constituents of Annona squamosa include the alkaloids oxophoebine, reticuline, isocorydine, and methylcorydaldine, and the flavonoid quercetin-3-O-glucoside. Bayer AG has patented the extraction process and molecular identity of the annonaceous acetogenin annonin, as well as its use as a biopesticide. Other acetogenins have been isolated from the seeds, bark, and leaves. References External links Annona squamosa L.

A distinguished staff officer and an ardent Venizelist and anti-royalist, Pangalos played a leading role in the September 1922 revolt that deposed King Constantine I and in the establishment of the Second Hellenic Republic. In June 1925 Pangalos staged a bloodless coup, and his assumption of power was recognized by the National Assembly which named him Prime Minister. As a \\"constitutional dictator\\" he ruled the country until his overthrow in August 1926. From April 1926 until his deposition, he also occupied the office of President of the Republic. Pangalos withdrew from public life for a while, but remained active in the Venizelist military circles. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, Pangalos and military officers close to him played a role in the establishment of the Security Battalions and was widely suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Cleared by a postwar court, he ran unsuccessfully for political office and died in 1952. Early career Pangalos with Konstantinos Nider, commander of the 1st Infantry Division, at the Macedonian front during World War I. Pangalos was born on the island of Salamis on 11/23 January 1878. His mother was descendant of the local Arvanite fighter of the Greek Revolution, Giannakis Meletis (Hatzimeletis), while his paternal side came from an aristocratic family of Kea island. He graduated from the Greek Army Academy on 16/29 July 1900 as an Infantry Second Lieutenant, and continued his studies in Paris, France. During the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 he served as a staff officer in the 6th Infantry Division. He was head of the forces that entered Sidirokastro (Demir Hisar) during the second Balkan war. In 1916 he joined Eleftherios Venizelos' Provisional Government of National Defence against King Constantine I, and was tasked with recruiting the 9th Cretan Regiment for the new government. He did not have a chance to lead it to battle though, because when King Constantine abdicated and Venizelos took over the governance of all of Greece in June 1917, he was appointed chief of the personnel department in the Ministry of Military Affairs. In early 1918 he went to the front as Chief of Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in the Strymon sector of the Macedonian front. In late 1918 he was appointed chief of staff of the General Headquarters, holding the post until the electoral victory of the pro-royalist and anti-Venizelist United Opposition in November 1920, when he was dismissed from the army. In 1922, Pangalos supported the 11 September 1922 Revolution, led by Nikolaos Plastiras, which abolished the monarchy and declared the Second Hellenic Republic, and played a major role in the rapid establishment of the regime in Athens, while Plastiras and the army were still sailing from Chios. His first job was to prosecute a number of prominent pro-monarchist government leaders by military court in what became known as the Trial of the Six. On 14/27 November he was named Minister for Military Affairs and tasked with reorganizing the Greek army in Macedonia and Thrace, as the war with Turkey was not over, and an attack in the region was feared to be imminent. The reorganization of the \\"Army of Evros\\", which he commanded from mid- December, was so successful that the Greek High Command prepared for a possible advance into Eastern Thrace in the face of the Turkish demands in the Lausanne peace talks. The military threat posed by Pangalos' army helped the Turks back down, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed. A staunch nationalist, Pangalos objected to the terms of the treaty, and declared that his troops would attack Turkey nonetheless in order to block the deal. He was forced to resign, but his stance made him popular with the many segments of Greek society that objected to the treaty. During the period of political instability that followed, Pangalos jumped into the fray, gaining and losing a number of ministerial positions as governments came and went. He assisted in the suppression of the failed Leonardopoulos‚ÄìGargalidis coup d'√©tat attempt in October 1923, and was elected to Parliament for Thessaloniki in December. He was appointed Minister for Public Order in the cabinet of Alexandros Papanastasiou on 31 March 1924, holding the post until 18 June, when he became once more Minister for Military Affairs, retaining the post until the cabinet's resignation on 25 July 1924. In power Soldiers on the streets of Athens during Pangalos' 1925 coup d'√©tat. Pangalos shortly after his successful coup On June 24, 1925, officers loyal to Pangalos, fearing that the political instability was putting the country at risk, overthrew the government in a coup and forced President Pavlos Kountouriotis to appoint Pangalos as Prime Minister. Pangalos immediately abolished the young republic and began to prosecute anyone who could possibly challenge his authority, including his old chief, Plastiras. Freedom of the press was abolished, and a number of repressive laws were enacted (including a law dictating the length of women's skirts - no more than 30 cm above the ground), while Pangalos awarded himself the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. Pangalos declared a state of emergency on 3 January 1926 and assumed dictatorial powers. In April 1926, he had himself elected president as well in a rigged election. On the economic front Pangalos attempted to devalue the currency by ordering paper notes cut in half. His political and diplomatic inability however became soon apparent. He conceded too many rights to Yugoslav commerce in Thessaloniki, but worst of all, he embroiled Greece in the so-called War of the Stray Dog, harming Greece's already strained international relations. Soon, many of the officers that had helped him come to power decided that he had to be removed. Regarding relations with Turkey, he still was not agreed with the treaty of Lausanne and tried to form an alliance with fascist Italy in a war against Turkey, with no success. On 29 August 1926, a counter-coup led by General Georgios Kondylis deposed him, and Kountouriotis returned as president, while Pangalos was imprisoned for two years in the Izzeddin Fortress. After his rule In 1930, Pangalos was sent to prison for a building scandal. He remained in prison for two years and was released during a period when a number of amnesties were given by Veniz√©los. He never regained the popular support he had before the coup, and never again played a role in Greek politics. After Greece fell to the Germans in 1941, Pangalos and other Venizelist officers moved to support the new collaborationist regime. He also played an important role, albeit from behind the stage, in the establishment of the Security Battalions, which he hoped to use against both the Communist- dominated National Liberation Front and against a possible return of King George II and the royal government from exile. Ambitious, tough and able, Pangalos was also widely distrusted for his rashness, megalomania and for being generally \\"half mad\\". Through Pangalos did not formally take a position with the Security Battalions, but he ensured his followers were given key positions in the Security Battalions. Pangalos was especially close to SS- Standartenf√ºhrer Walter Blume, who was regarded as the most extreme and violent of all the SS leaders in Greece. Blume intrigued in the summer of 1944 to have Pangalos appointed prime minister of the puppet Hellenic State to replace Ioannis Rallis, who was very close to a nervous breakdown by that point. He was accused of collaboration, but was cleared of all charges in September 1945. He unsuccessfully ran for parliament in 1950 and died in Kifissia two years later. His grandson, also named Theodoros Pangalos, served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Greece. He is a member of the PASOK socialist party. In popular culture Theodoros Pangalos is mentioned in the song Stin epohi tou Pangalou (In the times of Pangalos, ) by Giorgos Mitsakis, originally sung by George Dalaras.

Background  The Shura Council (, , \\"consultative council\\") was the upper house of the formerly bicameral Parliament of Egypt. Its name roughly translated into English as \\"the Consultative Council\\". The lower house of parliament is the House of Representatives. The council was abolished by the 2014 constitution. The Shura Council was created in 1980 through a Constitutional Amendment. The Council was composed of 264 members of which 176 members were directly elected and 88 were appointed by the President of the Republic for six-year terms. Membership was rotating, with one half of the Council renewed every three years. A legal challenge concerning the constitutionality of the Shura Council was to have been considered on 2 December 2012 by the High Constitutional Court, but the court postponed the verdict in response to protests. Mohamed Morsi's constitutional declaration issued in November 2012 bars the Shura Council from being dissolved by the judiciary. The constitutional declaration issued by Morsi in December 2012 allowed the Shura Council to be dissolved by the judiciary. The High Constitutional Court referred the lawsuit to the State Commissioners' Board, which is the advisory board of the High Constitutional Court, on 15 January 2013. The board of commissioners will review the lawsuit on 10 February 2013; after lawyers give the required documents, the board will create a report on the constitutionality of the election law. The report was received 22 April 2013. The formation of the Shura Council was ruled unconstitutional on 2 June 2013. As of early July 2013, 30 members of the Shura Council have resigned. The Shura Council was dissolved on 5 July 2013. The amendments that followed the 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum made the parliament a bicameral body, with the Shura Council abolished in 2014 restored as the Senate, which would consist of 120 elected members and 60 appointed by the president.  Members  The Shura Council comprised 264 members, two-thirds (176) of whom were elected by direct ballot, and the remaining third appointed by the President of the Republic. Half of all members were required to be farmers or workers. = Term of membership and activities = The term membership of the Shura Council was six years. However, renewed election and appointment of 50% of the total number of members was required every three years, and re-election and re-appointment was possible for those members whose terms were expiring. The Constitution provided many guarantees to protect the Council, including: * The Council may not be dissolved except by a Presidential decree and only in case of necessity. * Members of the Council have parliamentary immunity. = Candidates criteria = In accordance with the law, any candidate wishing to be elected to the Shura Council shall meet the following conditions: * Hold the Egyptian nationality as well as being the son/daughter of an Egyptian national. * Be not less than 35 years old upon election or nomination. * Have completed military service or be exempted therefrom. The Shura Council member is elected by the absolute majority of valid votes cast in the elections.  Powers  Although the powers of the Shura Council were not as extensive or effective as the People‚Äôs Assembly, its jurisdiction as provided by Articles (194) and (195) of the Constitutions of 1971 and 2012 covers the studying and proposing of what is deemed necessary to preserve the principles of the 23 July revolution and the 15 May 1971 Corrective Revolution. The Shura Council consulted on the following (Article 195): The council must ratify: * Constitutional amendment bills. * All treaties or agreements affecting Egypt‚Äôs territorial integrity or sovereignty. In case of disagreements with the People‚Äôs Assembly, a combined committee is formed composed of both chambers‚Äô chairmen and seven members from each chamber. The proposed bill is reconsidered in both chambers. If either still disagrees, the issue is once again in a joint session of both chambers to reach a common statement. The council is considered on a consultative capacity for: * Drafts, and general plans for social and economic development. * Bills referred to the Council by the President of the Republic. * All matters relating to the state‚Äôs general policy or international issues referred to the Shura Council by the President of the Republic. In this case, the council submitted its decision to the president and the People‚Äôs Assembly. Parliamentary elections There are currently many recognized political parties covering a broad political spectrum. However, the formation of political parties based on religion is prohibited by the Constitution. Opposition and political pressure groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, are active in Egypt and make their views public, and they are represented at various levels in the political system. The November 2000 parliamentary elections are generally regarded to have been more transparent and better executed than past elections. This is due to the new law put into force establishing universal judicial monitoring of polling stations. On the other hand, opposition parties continue to lodge credible complaints about electoral manipulation by the government. There are significant restrictions on the political process and freedom of expression for non-governmental organizations, including professional syndicates and organizations promoting respect for human rights. 2008 fire On 19 August 2008, a huge fire seriously damaged most of the 19th-century palace that houses the Shura Council in Cairo. At least thirteen people were hurt in the fire, which destroyed the parliamentary archive room and several meeting chambers. According to the Egyptian Channel 1, 99% of the documents were destroyed in the fire.

It showed many citizens of the state of Tennessee to be without sufficient access to colleges and universities, and led to the allocation of $200,000 in 1963 to implement the recommendations of the report. The State Board of Education developed a plan to locate community colleges in the underserved regions of Tennessee within a reasonable distance of travel to the majority of residents in each region. In 1965, the Tennessee General Assembly certified the establishment of the first wave of these institutions. In 1970, Walters State Community College became the sixth college created in this process. Walters State was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges in 1972, and received reaffirmation of accreditation in 1976, 1987 and 1997. =Presidents= *Dr. James W. Clark, was appointed as the first president of Walters State Community College in 1969 and served in that capacity until 1974. While classes were held in temporary quarters in Morristown during the first year of the college's operation, Dr. Clark oversaw the completion of The College Center, the first building built on the campus and opened in 1971. *Dr. Jack E. Campbell, who was hired in 1974 to succeed Clark, was considered one of the youngest college presidents at the time. Under his leadership, the campus expanded from the one campus location in Morristown with a population of 1,736 students to having four campuses with a total student population of 6,000 credit degree-seeking students and 5,000 students in non-degree, job training and continuing education courses at the time of his retirement in 2005. The College Center would be renamed in Dr. Campbell's honor. *Dr. Wade B. McCamey, who had previously been the president of Roane State Community College and previously served as vice-president of academic affairs at Walters State Community College, was selected in 2005 and has served in that capacity until June 2016. During his tenure, the college experienced more growth and expansion through the building of additional facilities on the Sevierville Campus, the Morristown campus(with one of the facilities named the Dr. Wade B. Campbell Student Services building upon his retirement) and the Greeneville campus. *Dr. Anthony (Tony) Miksa, was named the fourth president of Walters State in May 2016, and his tenure began on June 1.

Sir Herbert Ashcombe Walker, General Manager London and South Western Railway Early life Walker was born in London in 1868, the son of a doctor. He was educated at the North London Collegiate School and at Bruges.http://www.steamindex.com/people/managers.htm#surnw He then passed the Apothecaries' Hall exam. Career However, for family reasons, Walker joined the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) as a clerk at Euston in April 1885. In January 1889 he became outdoor assistant to the Superintendent of the Line. In 1893 he was made Assistant District Superintendent, North Wales Division and 10 months later was moved to the same job in the Southern Division (covering London to Stafford); in 1902 he became District Superintendent Euston, when he visited the US to study American practice. In October 1909, he became Assistant to the Superintendent of the Line and in July 1910 Outdoor Goods Manager for the southern half of the LNWR. From 1 January 1912, he became General Manager of the London and South Western Railway,Klapper p.12 where he instigated the programme of third-rail electrification. He received a knighthood in March 1915. In January 1917, he was acting chairman of the Railway Executive Committee, for which he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). After a frustrating year of indecision on the part of the Southern Railway's Board, he was appointed General Manager there in 1923, where he encouraged the electrification programme. In this respect, he was a major influence on steam locomotive development, or the lack of it, on the Southern. On his retirement in 1937, he served as a Director of the Southern Railway until the end of its existence in 1947. He died in London on 29 September 1949.Klapper p.20 Character Walker was physically well made, having stamina and a commanding presence. He looked what he was, a man who knew his job and meant to do it and had a remarkable memory. There is a memorial to him, including a stone cameo portrait, set in the stonework at Waterloo station, commemorating his involvement in the rebuilding of the station, completed in 1922 and the electrification of the Southern Railway. He was a strong advocate of the Channel Tunnel.

In 2001 they had a population of 13,271.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Urban Areas : Table KS01 : Usual Resident Population Retrieved 2009-08-26 Lying within the historic boundaries of County Durham, the villages are first recorded in print in 1170. Their names evolved from the words \\"Bold\\" or \\"Botl\\", meaning a building, and \\"dun\\", meaning a hill. In 1866, work began sinking a pit that began producing coal in 1869, and was then known as Boldon New Winning. The village that developed nearby in the 1870s became known as Boldon Colliery. When the mine was deepened and extended in the 1910s, further housing to accommodate the workforce was built to the south of the pit in an area known as Boldon New Town. Until 1974 the area was administered as an urban district of County Durham, but since then has been part of the borough of South Tyneside. In 1976, the Boldon Colliery Band appeared in episode 13 of the television series When the Boat Comes In. The mine closed in 1982 but more jobs became available when an Asda supermarket opened in 1987. Recent developments include Boldon Business Park. Boldon Colliery also has its own multi-screen cinema operated by Cineworld. The main secondary school in the area is Boldon School, a specialist sports college. Housing and environment The Boldons form part of the suburban fringe of South Tyneside and are completely surrounded by green belt. There are conservation areas within the historic village centres of East and West Boldon. East Boldon is considered the more affluent sought after area of the Boldons. With a reputation competing with nearby Cleadon, East Boldon attracts a young professional family market and residents to this day have created a very much desired family, village environment. The three schools are very much sought after, they provide nursery, infants and juniors, who work together via the PTA. The village has its own community Facebook page and Friends of East Boldon Parks hold annual community events such as party in the park and Halloween trails etc. The East Boldon Scouts is one of the largest in the UK with over 200 attendees. House prices are higher than national average and sell quickly due to their desirability. Despite the relatively small geographical area, there are a significant number of older buildings considered as being of architectural merit including churches, public houses and former country houses, as well as modern additions. St. Nicholas Church in West Boldon is a Grade I listed building; much of the stonework dates from the thirteenth century, but the foundation of the building dates from the Saxon period.Church website The area includes a wide range of housing styles, from Edwardian villas to Victorian terraces, post-war housing to more recent smaller-scale developments. The first street built in Boldon Colliery was Cross Row (also known as Sinkers Row) which was constructed to house the men who were initially employed to sink the shaft. Several years later, other major housing projects were started and terraced housing such as that at Arnold Street and Charles Street were built. After the colliery was closed the former industrial land lay derelict for many years. In 2000, Colliery Wood was created with over 2,500 trees planted. The wood is popular with the local community and provides a habitat for animals such as pheasants, squirrels, woodpeckers and otters. Colliery Wood provides six new paths, which are also suitable for cycling and link to East Boldon, and Brockley Whins and Whiteleas in nearby South Shields. Boldon Flats is another site important for nature conservation, which contains an area of damp pasture. The flats are flooded from each October to March and attract a wide array of bird life and a large population of common frogs. West Boldon Lodge, constructed by the National Grid, is situated amongst a range of habitat, including wetland, grassland and woodland. Locally rare orchids are present at one site. The River Don traverses Boldon and is the last stronghold of water voles in South Tyneside. Development View through the front window of Tyne and Wear Metro train 4089 approaching Boldon West Junction Recent/proposed projects include: * the introduction of the Metro light rapid transit system connecting Boldon to the rest of Tyne & Wear * a new state-of-the-art senior school * new housing developments * an expansion to the ASDA Walmart superstore - one of the largest in northern England * a new Pizza Hut and Nando's restaurant and Starbucks at the leisure park * further growth of the business park * road and cycle way improvements * a new skate park, and * community woodland projects The new ¬£17.5 million Boldon School opened on 6 November 2006. It has been funded by a private finance initiative and was constructed by Gleeson Building Company as well as other small businesses. The new school boasts a ¬£750,000 theatre, top-of-the-range arts facilities, a four-lane 25-metre swimming pool and other new sports facilities such as five-a-side football pitches gymnasium. Computerised technology has been incorporated into the school's meals service, with school pupils using an electronic card system to purchase meals. The recently built Quadrus Centre at Boldon Business Park houses entrepreneurial businesses and acts as a gateway to South Tyneside on the main A19 trunk road. The building features a modern design within its lakeside setting. The building is illuminated at night in a range of colours and has won many awards for its iconic design. Sport Boldon has produced many notable sports personalities, among them former Newcastle United footballer Wes Saunders. Charlton Athletic goalkeeper Sam Bartram, their record appearance holder, who played 800 games for the London club, was signed from Boldon Villa in September 1934 and played in four successive Wembley cup finals from 1944 to 1947. Full back Jack Shreeve moved from the Villa to Charlton in 1935 and was a colleague of Bartram's in their 1947 FA Cup winning team. A Sam Bartram Memorial Cup competition was introduced at Boldon in February 2008 aimed at inspiring current footballing youngsters in the Boldon area. Other notable sportsmen from Boldon are cricketers Simon Brown and current England rugby youth player Robert Bell, Darlington striker Shaun Reay and Spennymoor Town midfielder Jamie Chandler. There are private tennis and golf clubs at Dipe Lane as well as other pursuits on offer within local schools, community centres and parks. The Jarrow Roofing Boldon Community Association F.C. was founded in 1987 and plays at The Boldon C.A. Sports Ground. Politics East Boldon and Cleadon was previously the only ward in South Tyneside to elect three Conservative councillors. However, in the 2011 Local Elections Labour candidate Joan Atkinson unseated the sitting Conservative councillor, reducing the number of Conservatives on South Tyneside Council to one. Boldon Colliery usually elects three Labour councillors. The Boldons are within the Jarrow constituency, which also includes Jarrow, Hebburn and parts of east Gateshead. The local MP is Kate Osborne of the Labour Party. In the earlier part of the 20th century, a famous son of the community was the Labour politician Jack Lawson.

It is also one of the least known works of Shigeru Miyamoto. The game was re- released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in all major regions throughout 2012.  Gameplay  In the game, Muddy has to move a black ball to a gate at the end of the screen in order to get to the next screen. He can push, pull, and throw the black ball. Muddy can also dig into soft ground to find underground paths around obstacles. Choosing where to dig is a crucial element of the game's various puzzles, as creating holes in the wrong areas could hinder the player's efforts to advance. Dropping the ball into a hole would cause it to return to its starting point. Given the nature of Muddy's ability to move the ball, digging holes in the wrong places could make reaching the gate with the ball completely impossible, requiring Muddy to leave the screen and then return to try again. Along the way, there are many obstacles, such as moving enemies, pipes, barrels, weights, and bosses.  Characters  Players play as a mole named Muddy Mole (known in Japan as , whose wife and children have been kidnapped by the farmer, Jinbe. Muddy must find and rescue his wife and seven children by navigating his way through the seven worlds of Jinbe Land; avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, stealing cabbages, and defeating the boss of each world. Freeing his loved ones one by one before coming face-to- face with Jinbe himself. Jinbe, a cabbage farmer and ruler of Jinbe Land, serves as the main antagonist to Muddy. He is depicted with a Mario-esque appearance and stature, wearing red overalls and a green shirt. His face is obscured by a full beard and he is seen wearing a brimmed gardener's hat. Jinbe Land is home to a wide variety of enemies sent by Jinbe to intercept Muddy before rescuing his family. These enemies include Yoshi-like dinosaurs as well as two unnamed \\"plumber sons\\" that Muddy must defeat later in the game. It is unknown if Mole Mania is canonically in the same universe as Mario. It has been speculated that Jinbe and Mario are related in some way.  Reception  Jason Cipriano of MTV praised the games' short and to-the-point puzzles. 1UP.com had compared the game to Adventures of Lolo when it comes to gameplay.

The first signs used by the state featured an all white square with a black outline of the geographic state of South Carolina with black numbers located in the center. In 1948, a more simple design was established; still using a white square with just the numbers and the initials \\"S.C.\\" at the top; a variant wider side was used for three-digit numbers.

It is a perennial, herbaceous climbing plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to a cold-hardy rhizome in autumn. It is dioecious (separate male and female plants). Hops are sometimes described as bine plants rather than vines because they have stiff downward facing hairs that provide stability and allow them to climb. These shoots allow H. lupulus to grow anywhere from . Hops have fragrant, wind-pollinated flowers that attract butterflies. The female cone shaped fruits from H. lupulus are used by breweries to preserve and flavor beer, and so H. lupulus is widely cultivated for use by the brewing industry. The fragrant flower cones, known as hops, impart a bitter flavor, and also have aromatic and preservative qualities. H. lupulus contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins, and resin.  Etymology  The genus name Humulus is a medieval name that was at some point latinized after being borrowed from a Germanic source exhibiting the h‚Ä¢m‚Ä¢l consonant cluster, as in Middle Low German homele. According to Soviet Iranist V. Abaev this could be a word of Sarmatian origin which is presented in modern Ossetian language () and derives from proto-Iranian hauma- arayka, an Aryan haoma.–ê–±–∞–µ–≤ –í. –ò. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∫–æ-—ç—Ç–∏–º–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –æ—Å–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞. –¢. 4. –ú.‚Äî–õ., 1989. –°. 261-262. From Sarmatian dialects this word spread across Eurasia, thus creating a group of related words in Turkic, Finno-Ugric, Slavic and Germanic languages (see , Chuvash —ÖƒÉ–º–ª–∞, Finnish humala, Hungarian koml√≥, Mordovian –∫–æ–º–ª–∞, Avar —Ö–æ–º–µ–ª–ª–µ–≥). The specific epithet lupulus is Latin for \\"small wolf\\". The name refers to the plant's tendency to strangle other plants, mainly osiers or basket willows (Salix viminalis), like a wolf does a sheep. Hops could be seen growing over these willows so often that it was named the willow-wolf. The English word hop is derived from the Middle Dutch word , also meaning Humulus lupulus.  Description  Humulus lupulus is a perennial herbaceous plant up to 10 meters tall, living up to 20 years. It has simple leaves with 3-5 deep lobes that can be opposite or alternate . The staminate (male) flowers do not have petals, while the pistillate (female) flowers‚Äô petals completely cover the fruit. The cones found on female plants are called strobili. The fruit of H. lupulus is an achene, meaning that the fruit is dry and does not split open at maturity. The achene is surrounded by tepals and lupulin-secreting glands are concentrated on the fruit. Humulus lupulus grows best in the latitude range of 38¬∞-51¬∞ in full sun with moderate amounts of rainfall. It uses the longer summer days as a cue for when to flower, which is usually around July/ August. Humulus lupulus can cause dermatitis to some who handle them. It is estimated that about 1 in 30 people are affected by this.  Varieties  'Golden' hop The five varieties of this species (Humulus lupulus) are: * H. l. var. lupulus ‚Äì Europe, western Asia * H. l. var. cordifolius ‚Äì eastern Asia * H. l. var. lupuloides (syn. H. americanus) ‚Äì eastern North America * H. l. var. neomexicanus - western North American. * H. l. var. pubescens ‚Äì midwestern and eastern North America Many cultivated varieties are found in the list of hop varieties. A yellow-leafed ornamental cultivar, Humulus lupulus 'Aureus', is cultivated for garden use. It is also known as golden hop, and holds the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (AGM).  Domestication  Humulus lupulus is first mentioned in 768 CE when King Pepin donated hops to a monastery in Paris. Cultivation was first recorded in 859 CE, in documents from a monastery in Freising, Germany.  Use in brewing  The chemical compounds found in H. lupulus are main components in flavoring and bittering beer. Some other compounds help with creating foam in beer. Chemicals such as linalool and aldehydes contribute to the flavor of beer. The main components of bitterness in beer are iso-alpha acids, with many other compounds contributing to the overall bitterness of beer. Until the Middle Ages, Myrica gale was the most common plant used for brewing beer. H. lupulus took off as a flavoring agent for beer because it contains preserving agents, making the beer viable for longer.

Their brother, David Barnes, is an artist and has designed most of the band's artwork for albums since the release of The Gay Parade. of Montreal Barnes and bandmates on stage in San Francisco, 2007. of Montreal consists of various musicians, with Barnes being the only continuous member. The group has recorded sixteen studio albums, beginning with Cherry Peel, and, most recently, UR FUN, which was released on January 17, 2020 on Polyvinyl. While melodic pop has always been Barnes' primary vehicle, their style has managed to transform significantly since the 1997 release of Cherry Peel. The acoustic tendencies of early albums gradually transformed into a more electronic, funk, and overall eclectic sound. One of the features which often appears in Barnes' songwriting is their penchant for composing upbeat melodies to gloomy lyrics and morose subject matter. At different periods in the band's career they have dealt with subjects both personal and fictional. Barnes is prolific lyricist with a tendency to employ unusual words and phrases and complicated wordplay. Lyrics Kevin sings for of Montreal in San Francisco, 2007. Kevin Barnes' writing has encompassed many styles over the years. Of Montreal's first album Cherry Peel dealt mainly with personal issues of unrequited love, as in the songs \\"Baby\\" or \\"Montreal\\", or humorous mundane situations, as in \\"Tim I Wish You Were Born a Girl\\". Their style then shifted to story-telling, often involving dialogues, as in \\"Good Morning Mr. Edminton\\" from the album Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse, or fictional characters, such as Rose Robert or Jacques Lamure, or even fictional mythological creature, like the Efeblum. The albums The Gay Parade, The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy and the referred Coquelicot are constructed as concept albums. By 2004, though, Barnes was starting to revert to more personal lyrics, even incorporating the names of the people close to them and using them as characters in their own songs: *Their daughter Alabee, in \\"So Begins Our Alabee\\" and \\"Miss Blonde Your Papa Is Failing\\". *Eva, an acquaintance and resident of Athens, in \\"Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider\\". Kevin Barnes has fluctuated between writing personal and fictional lyrics over the course of their career, in part because negative reviews their first album received deterred them from writing about themself for a period of time. They explained: > \\"I think if you only write about yourself and your personal life it feels > maybe a bit narcissistic, but I think it‚Äôs inevitable that there will always > be some aspect of your personal life or your personal emotions coming > through, even if you write about something that would seem like fiction.\\" Their lyrics, though mostly concerned with dark themes, often portray a certain fondness for: *French literature, especially the works of Jean Genet, Guillaume Apollinaire or Georges Bataille; *Avant-garde cinema, mentioning Luis Bu√±uel's Phantom of Liberty in \\"Lysergic Bliss\\", Jaromil Jire≈°' Valerie and Her Week of Wonders in \\"St. Exquisite Confessions\\", or Wong Kar-wai in \\"Rapture Rapes The Muses\\"; *Greek mythology ‚Äì\\"Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse\\", \\"Rapture Rapes the Muses\\" with references to \\"antediluvian Troy\\", or their frequent use of antonomasia (Petrarch and Dido in \\"So Begins Our Alabee\\", \\"Cato As a Pun\\"). Despite common assumption, Barnes does not use recreational drugs or psychedelics to aid in their writing, composing, or recording. On stage Barnes playing a solo set at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery Masonic lodge in 2014 With of Montreal, Barnes has always tried to cross the bridge between their love of theater, comedy, and music, often resulting in interludes between songs‚Äîskits, slow-motion sword fights and surreal interaction between band members. However, since the release of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, Barnes has been performing as their on- stage glam rock alter ego, Georgie Fruit, first mentioned in \\"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal.\\" Kevin has said that the album shows their transformation to Georgie Fruit, as is evident in the variation in musical style from in album leading up to \\"The Past Is a Grotesque Animal\\" and the two songs after. They have described Georgie Fruit as a black man in his forties who has undergone multiple sex changes. Georgie, Kevin told Pitchfork Media, was in a funk-rock band called Arousal back in the seventies. Barnes has performed in unusual circumstances such as on a white horse and while completely nude. Other projects *A Pollinaire Rave is a comedy tour by Kevin Barnes, their brother David Barnes and ex-wife, Nina. A CD with the same name was sold, and five of the seven songs on the EP became songs on the Montreal album Satanic Panic in the Attic. *They also played keyboard on \\"The Difference in the Shades\\", and did the background vocals on \\"A Poetic Retelling of an Unfortunate Seduction\\" on Bright Eyes' album Letting Off the Happiness.  Personal life  In 2003, Barnes married Nina Aimee Gr√∏ttland, a graphic artist and former Ethnobabes member. They separated in December 2013. They have one daughter, Alabee, born in Oslo on December 29, 2004. Barnes identifies as bisexual, non-binary and genderqueer, and uses they/them, he/him, or she/her pronouns.

It is home to the Quad Cities River Bandits, a Class-A affiliate of the Houston Astros. Since 1987, St. Ambrose University plays all of its home baseball games there as well. Located on the banks of the Mississippi River, in the shadow of the Centennial Bridge, home run balls to right field often land in the river. History As night games became more necessary, Davenport teams were playing at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, without lights. The city of Davenport realized a lighted stadium, downtown, on the riverfront, would be ideal. Proposed by the Davenport Levee Commission, Municipal Stadium opened May 26, 1931, within LeClaire Park. The ballpark was built at a cost of $185,000. The first night game was June 4, 1931. Expansions in the 1940s and in 1962 brought capacity up to 6,200 and 8,500 respectively. It is one of the oldest ballparks still in use in all of the minor leagues, although it underwent a major renovation before the 1989 season, lowering the seating capacity to 5,200 and before the 2004 season that brought the ballpark up to modern professional baseball standards and a seating capacity of 4,024. John O'Donnell Stadium, May 5, 2001 On May 27, 1971, the stadium was renamed John O'Donnell Stadium in honor of the longtime sports editor of the Davenport Times-Democrat, shortly following his death. John O'Donnell Stadium was renamed Modern Woodmen Park on December 12, 2007, after Rock Island-based Modern Woodmen of America purchased the naming rights to the facility. O'Donnell's name remains on the ballpark's press box. Football tenants For many years, Modern Woodmen Park played host to football games in the fall. Both Assumption High School (a private Catholic high school in Davenport) and Saint Ambrose College called the field home until 1987, when both schools began playing at Brady Street Stadium in 1988. The football bleachers and press box along left field were removed in 1989. 2000s‚Äìpresent renovations Renovations done before the 2004 season included a nine-foot-high berm that provided a lawn seating area for fans. The berm also acted as a flood wall around the entire stadium. Until that point, the facility had no protection from Mississippi River flooding, which caused the team to play home games at other parks during river floods. During the Great Flood of 1993, photos of water creeping across the playing field at the ballpark made national publications and became somewhat of a symbol of the flood. In spring 2019, the surrounding area was flooded but the ballpark remained above water. After the 2007 season, new owners Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt of Main Street Baseball reinvigorated both the ballpark and the franchise. They sold naming rights to Modern Woodmen in a record 20-year deal, changed the name of the franchise back to \\"River Bandits\\", and made numerous improvements to the ballpark. In 2008, the club added a hot tub deck in right field, as well as a \\"tiki village\\", featuring three tiki bars, a covered tiki lounge, and a king-sized tiki bed beyond the right field wall. They also excavated a gravel area along the left-field foul line and planted field corn; by mid-season the corn grows high enough so that the home-team players are introduced at the beginning of the game and come running out of the corn field, just like in the movie Field of Dreams. Modern Woodmen Park from the Centennial Bridge For 2009, Main Street Baseball continued to make improvements, adding a new , HD ribbon board along the right field fence and installing four new concourse-level \\"loge boxes\\" to accommodate small groups of people. Prior to the 2010 season, the City of Davenport and Main Street Baseball replaced the entire field, to facilitate proper drainage and minimize rain-outs. Other changes for 2010 included a new concession stand on the Picnic Plaza level and a new group terrace next to the Tiki Village beyond the right-center field fence. Modern Woodmen Park Ferris wheel, 2014 In 2014, the facility received another addition, as a Ferris wheel was constructed just beyond the left field wall. In 2017, the park added a double-decker carousel purchased from Pier 39 in San Francisco. Joshua Hill pitch, Centennial Bridge from the Ballpark 2003 Awards For both the 2008 and 2009 seasons, Modern Woodmen Park won the \\"Best Ballpark Improvement\\" Award from Ballparkdigest.com, the industry's leading publication. In 2013, the park was voted as the top minor-league ballpark in the United States in a USA Today and 10best.com reader poll. Modern Woodmen Park beat second place Louisville Slugger Field by around 2,000 votes. In 2018, Modern Woodmen Park finished third in the \\"Best View in the Minors\\" competition, finishing behind El Paso's Southwest University Park and Altoona's Peoples Natural Gas Field. Notable events The River Bandits (then known as the Swing of the Quad Cities) defeated the Burlington Bees, 1‚Äì0, in the first game at the renovated Modern Woodmen Park on April 29, 2004. The 2006 and 2011 Midwest League All-Star Games were held at Modern Woodmen Park. Previously, the ballpark hosted Midwest League All-Star Games in 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 1982 and 1990, giving the facility a total of eight. In summer 2007, portions of the film Sugar were shot at the park. This included 800‚Äì1,000 people a night showing up to be extras. The movie follows the path of a young man from the impoverished Dominican Republic as he chases dreams of baseball stardom in America. The stadium was the site of the \\"Rumble on the Riverbank\\" boxing match on May 10, 1991. Michael Nunn, a Davenport native, lost the IBF middleweight title to James Toney. \\"Mississippi River Jam II\\" was held on June 3, 1979, featuring AC/DC, Heart, UFO TKO and Nazareth. The facility has hosted many concerts by many artists, including: Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Johnny Winter, Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, REO Speedwagon, Blue √ñyster Cult, Eddie Money, Edgar Winter Group and Lonestar. Johnny Cash played at the stadium twice, in 1974 and 1976, drawing over 10,000 each time and playing for free. On October 1, 1936, an exhibition game featuring major- league players and Negro National League All Stars included Baseball Hall of Fame players Satchel Paige, Cool Papa Bell, Rogers Hornsby and Johnny Mize.

They were signed during a massively followed general strike initiated after the election of the Popular Front in May 1936, which had led to the creation of a left-wing government headed by L√©on Blum (SFIO). Also known as the \\"Magna Carta of French Labor\\", these agreements were signed at the H√¥tel Matignon, official residence of the head of the government, hence their name.  The May‚ÄìJune general strike and the Matignon agreements  The negotiations, in which participated Beno√Æt Frachon for the CGT, Marx Dormoy (SFIO) as under-secretary of state to the President of the Council, Jean-Baptiste Lebas (SFIO, Minister of Labour), had started on 6 June at 3 PM, but the pressure from the workers' movement was such that the employers' confederation quickly accepted the unions' terms. A general strike had been initiated in Le Havre on 26 May, accompanied by factory occupations to prevent lock outs, and had quickly spread to all of France. More than a million workers were on strike. The social movement immediately followed the electoral victory of the Popular Front, in order to reach this position of force. Interior Minister Roger Salengro publicly announced the following day the success of the negotiations. Without having to organize strike in each factory in order to gain some advantages for them, all of the workers benefited with these agreements of: *the legal right to strike *the removal of all obstacles to union organization (including the right to have representatives, named d√©l√©gu√©s du personnel, elected by secret ballot, which may not be fired without approval from the labour inspection - inspection du travail - and thus are protected from pressures by the employers *and a blanket 7-12 percent wage increase for all workers (it is thus the reverse of deflation, and is an economic policy based on demand) (the female workers in Verdun even succeeded in obtaining a 400% wages increase) Furthermore, Blum's government deposed on 5 June five law projects, prepared by the Minister of Labour Jean-Baptiste Lebas, which were easily adopted during the month. These laws granted: *paid vacations (two weeks - for the first time in France) (voted by the National Assembly on 20 June 1936) *40-hour work week paid 48 (adopted by the Assembly on 21 June 1936). *collective bargaining (adopted by the Assembly on 24 June 1936) *the repeal of the 1935 decree-laws concerning the wages of public servants and the taxes on World War I veterans' pensions. On 11 June, Maurice Thorez, national secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF), stated that \\"one must know how to finish a strike, at the moment that the main points have been obtained.\\" His declaration was published in L'Humanit√©, the press organ of the PCF. Alluding to Marceau Pivert's famous statement, he recalled that \\"Not everything was possible but the slogan is still: 'Everything for the Popular Front!' 'Everything by the Popular Front'\\" French: \\"il faut savoir terminer une gr√®ve, d√®s l'instant o√π les revendications essentielles ont √©t√© obtenues\\".. \\"Tout n'est pas possible mais le mot d'ordre reste Tout pour le front populaire! Tout par le Front populaire!\\". Work was resumed at the Renault factories on 13 and 15 June and in the steelworking industry.

The author was an Icelandic priest, Ari √ûorgilsson, working in the early 12th century. The work originally existed in two different versions but only the younger one has survived. The older contained information on Norwegian kings, made use of by later writers of kings' sagas. The priest J√≥n Erlendsson in Villingaholt (died 1672) in the service of bishop Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson made two copies of √çslendingab√≥k (now AM 113 a fol and AM 113 b fol at the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies), the latter one because the bishop was unhappy with the first version. The original copied from is assumed to have dated to ca. 1200. It was lost in the course of the late 17th century, and when √Årni Magn√∫sson looked for it, it had disappeared without a trace. Style and sources √çslendingab√≥k is a concise work which relates the major events of Icelandic history in terse prose. While the author is forced to rely almost exclusively on oral history he takes pains to establish the reliability of his sources and mentions several of them by name. He avoids supernatural material and Christian bias. The prologue of the book explicitly states that whatever might be wrong in the account must be corrected to \\"that which can be proven to be most true\\". Due to these qualities of the work and the early time of its writing, historians consider it the most reliable extant source on early Icelandic history. Content Apart from a prologue and a genealogy at the end, √çslendingab√≥k is split into ten short chapters. =Prologue= =1. Settlement of Iceland= Iceland is settled in the days of Harald I of Norway by immigrants from Norway. The first settler, Ing√≥lfur Arnarson, arrives in Reykjav√≠k. When the first settlers arrive Iceland is said to be forested \\"from the coast to the mountains\\". =2. Bringing of laws from Norway= When Iceland had largely been settled a man named √ölflj√≥tr becomes the first man to bring laws there from Norway. Another man, Gr√≠mr Goatshoe (or possibly Goatbeard), investigates all of Iceland before Al√æingi (Parliament) can be established. Ari's text is somewhat unclear here. Presumably Gr√≠mr explored the country to find a good meeting place. =3. Establishment of Al√æingi= The Al√æingi is established on √ûingvellir, which becomes public property - it was confiscated from a man who had killed a slave. After 60 years the settlement of Iceland is complete. Ulflj√≥tr becomes the first Lawspeaker. =4. Fixing of the calendar= The wisest men of Iceland notice that the calendar is slowly moving out of sync with the seasons. The problem lies in the fact that the calendar in use had 52 weeks to the year, only 364 days. As people come to the conclusion that something like a day is missing they are still reluctant to use a year which doesn't contain a whole number of weeks. A man named √ûorsteinn surtr comes up with an ingenious solution - a whole week should be added once every seven years. The proposal is enacted into law by the assembly around 955. =5. Partition of Iceland into judicial quadrants= The system of ad hoc local judicial assemblies becomes unwieldy and a need is felt for standardization. A man named √û√≥r√∞r gellir describes to Al√æingi his recent difficulties in prosecuting a certain case in a local assembly. He suggests that the country should be split into judicial quadrants, each of which should contain three assemblies. Each quadrant, then, should contain a special assembly for appeals. The motion passes with the amendment that the northern quadrant should have four assemblies, since the northerners couldn't agree on any three. =6. Discovery and settlement of Greenland= Greenland is discovered and settled from Iceland around 985. Erik the Red gave the country its pleasant name to encourage people to move there. The Norse settlers find remnants of previous human habitation and deduce that the people who lived there were related to the skr√¶lingjar of V√≠nland. =7. Conversion of Iceland to Christianity= King Olaf I of Norway sends the missionary priest √ûangbrandr to Iceland to convert the inhabitants to Christianity. He has some success in baptizing chieftains but also meets opposition and ends up killing two or three men who had composed libellous poetry about him. He returns to Norway after one or two years with a litany of complaints and tells the king that he has little hope that the country can be converted. The king is furious at hearing the news and threatens to hurt or kill Icelanders in Norway. Two of the Icelandic chieftains previously converted by √ûangbrandr meet with the king and pledge their aid in converting the country. In the summer of 999 or 1000 the issue of religion reaches a crisis point at the Al√æingi. The Christian faction and the pagan faction do not want to share the same laws and the Christians choose a new lawspeaker for themselves, Hallr √° S√≠√∞u. He reaches an agreement with √ûorgeirr Lj√≥svetningago√∞i, the pagan lawspeaker, that √ûorgeirr will find a compromise acceptable to everyone. √ûorgeirr goes to his camp and stays under a skin for the remainder of the day and the following night. The day after he gives a speech at L√∂gberg. He says that the only way to maintain peace in the country is for everyone to keep to the same laws and the same religion. {  :√ûat mon ver√∞a satt, es v√©r sl√≠tum √≠ sundr l«´gin, at v√©r monum sl√≠ta ok fri√∞inn.  \\"It will prove true that if we tear apart the laws we will also tear apart the peace.\\"  } Before reciting the compromise he has come up with √ûorgeirr gets his audience to pledge themselves to a solution with one set of laws for all the country. √ûorgeirr then decrees that everyone not already baptized must convert to Christianity. Three concessions are made to the pagans. # The old laws allowing exposure of newborn children will remain in force. # The old laws on the eating of horsemeat will remain in force. # People can make pagan sacrifices in private. Some years later those concessions are abolished. =8‚Äì10.

Old Icelandic Literature and Society, Cambridge University Press, 2000. Namesake A website named islendingabok.is contains a full genealogy of 720,000 Icelanders starting with the information contained in √çslendingab√≥k. The genealogy was started by an Icelandic programmer, Fridrik Sk√∫lason using a DOS program called Esp√≥l√≠n in 1988. In 1997 K√°ri Stef√°nsson and his company deCODE genetics created a website with Sk√∫lason which has been expanded using genetic analysis to cover 95% of the Icelanders who have lived in the last three centuries. It has given rise to a popular app which young Icelanders use to check whether they are related. References * Finnur J√≥nsson (editor) (1930). Are hinn fr√≥√æe √ûorgilsson : √çslendingab√≥k.
