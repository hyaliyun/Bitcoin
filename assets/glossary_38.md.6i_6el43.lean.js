He is Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Vice-President (Research) at La Trobe University and a Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne, Australia specialising in X-ray optics and near-field optics. He was born in Bath, England. He received a first class honours degree from the University of Adelaide and his postgraduate degree from the Australian National University in Canberra. In 1989 Professor Nugent in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Wilkins pioneered a form of X-ray optics known as lobster-eye optics. Using the capillary structure found in lobster eyes, Nugent and Wilkins were able to design telescopes with a 360 degree view of the sky. This was initially planned to be used in a LOBSTER satellite which would, indeed, conduct 360 degree surveys of the sky, though never came to fruition. NASA currently have plans to use the technology to view space objects and phenomena from the International Space Station. In 2001 Nugent was made a Federation Fellow by the Australian Government. This position was renewed in 2006. He also chairs the Sciences Advisory Board of IATIA, a company designed to commercialise some of his inventions. Nugent is a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA). He sits on the Advisory Board of the Australian Synchrotron. Since 2005 Nugent has been director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, based at the University of Melbourne, where he has driven the development of coherent X-ray diffraction methods for imaging biological structures. His other research focusses on the complete recovery of phase from intensity and the applications of this to imaging. This work is currently being used to monitor wear in car engines and has potential for research into the treatment of cancer.

Written in 1906, it premiered April 13, 1910 and was revised in 1956. The origin to Arnljot is a melody that Wilhelm Peterson-Berger created when he first visited J√§mtland in 1898. When he journeyed over Storsj√∂n he was inspired by the nearby mountains, Oviksfj√§llen. The opera consists of three parts and the historical foundation of the opera is the character Arnljot Gelline that is mentioned in Snorri Sturluson saga about Olav Haraldsson (den Helige, Rex perpetuus Norvegiae) and the writings on Fr√∂s√∂stenen, the rune stone that is placed on Fr√∂s√∂n. Out of these components, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger wrote his drama. Performance history The original performance of Arnljot as an opera was put on on April 13, 1910 at the Royal Theater in Stockholm.History of the Royal Swedish Opera (retrieved Sep 11, 2007) However, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger had already two years earlier allowed amateurs to perform parts of the texts and music on Fr√∂s√∂n on a midsummer night eve. Nearly 3.000 persons witnessed this amateur performance of the Arnljot play. Today, each summer the Arnljot play (the opera is performed as a play, but the texts and music remains the same) staged in an outdoor environment on the island of Fr√∂s√∂n, close to where the actual premiere took place in 1908. The background of the stage is a panoramic view over Storsj√∂n and Oviksfj√§llen; thus, when the audience hears the introduction tune of the opera, they see the same view as Wilhelm Peterson-Berger did when he created the opera. 2012 is the 73rd summer with Arnljot on Fr√∂s√∂n since 1935. Famous passage from the drama The quote below serves as an inspiration for the present-day independence movement (an established cultural institution) that exists in the Swedish province of Jamtland. \\"Listen Jamtar ('J√§mts') to what I have to say for a while. Not even eighty winters have passed since Jamtland was still free and in charge of its own business. Back then, no taxes was given away to foreign kings. Why we settled being enslaved, at first under Norway and then under Svitiod [a reference to Sweden], are something that I have never understood. This country, being protected by forests, bogs and mountains, is difficult to raid and easy to defend. There are plenty of fighting men among us and more such men can be brought here if paid by goods. Therefore, I now advise you - end this dispute of which kingdom we belong. Let us refuse all foreign attempts to make us a county, no matter who demands this from us. Let us again seize our former freedom and elect a chief for all of our country, a king who will lead our struggle if the struggle is needed to defend our homes and our land.\\" / Sigurd in Slandrom, one of the chieftains in J√§mtland supporting Arnljot as king, at the \\"thing\\" on Fr√∂s√∂n, act I, June 1025.

The family is recorded in France from the 10th century, as Barons in Britain from the 11th century, as Lairds in Scotland from the 14th century and later in Orkney. In the 17th century they were prominent in Northern Ireland and also spread to various parts of the United States including the Cajun community. Other branches of the family settled in Argentina in the 19th century, and in the British Colonies.  France  The name is French. Goidfrid de Traillie came to England and held land in Bedford and on the Scottish border, both under William the Conqueror. The Traills held land at Trelly in France and later in Bordeaux. Before 1391, Sir John Trailly was appointed Mayor of Bordeaux. Some Traills still reside in France.http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C9294370The Controversy between Sir Richard Scrope and Sir Robert Grosvenor in the Court of Chivalry A.D. MCCCLXXXV - MCCCXC, by Sir N. Harris Nicholas K.H., Vol II, p. 223 ff. ( in Internet Archive) The similarity to the name Tyrell raises the question whether the families are related, but the Tyrell family are descended from the family of the Count de Poix, of which the senior branch remained in France in the area known as Picardy. There is no known relationship between the two families in England: the Tyrells held land in the South in Devon and Somerset, unlike Goidfrid de Trailli (see above).  Scotland  The family started to leave England for Scotland and France after the death of Sir John Treyl in 1360, although his son John did return for periods and served as a member of the House of Commons of England. A few years before this Sir John's death in 1401, his son Reginald returned from Bordeaux and had sold up the English estates by his own death in 1404. Earlier in approximately 1385, Sir John's brother, Walter Treyl, Bishop of St Andrews, bought Blebo from the Church and later willed it to his nephew, Thomas. William Dunbar in his Lament for the Makaris writes \\"He hes Blind Harry and Sandy Traill / Slaine with his schour of mortall haill / Whilk Patrik Johnestoun myght nocht fle\\",, lines 69‚Äì71 citing him among a roll call of poets chiefly from the fifteenth century, but nothing else is known of Sandy Traill and no works have been traced. Robert Traill of Greyfriars was born in 1603. He was son of Colonel James Traill, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. He graduated with an M.A. from St Andrews on 21 July 1621. He later studied at the Protestant College of Saumur. He was an English tutor in France to the sister of the Duke of Rohan in 1628. Blebo, a large rural property, was subdivided in 1609 by the Laird of the period, John Traill, in agreement with his eldest son in order to help his younger brother Thomas. The smaller portion became known as Blebo Hole. In the 16th century another brother of the same family, George Traill, migrated to Orkney, Scotland and thence to Co. Antrim, Ireland, now Northern Ireland. In 1722, lead and silver were discovered on the Blebo property. The area around the estate (Blebo Hole) is currently known as the community of Blebo Craigs. In Central Fife, Blebo lies three miles (five km) east of Cupar and comprises the village of Blebo Craigs, located a quarter-mile (0.4 km) northeast of Blebo House, together with the farms of Milton of Blebo, Blebo Mains, and Newbigging of Blebo. Kemback lies a quarter-mile (0.4 km) to the northwest and Pitscottie a half-mile (0.8 km) to the southwest. A group of Trails came from Birsay on Orkney including Samuel Trail and his son James W. H. Trail. Thomas Stewart Traill was from Kirkwall.

United States  In the mid 17th century, Trails acquired and settled land in the North America, in Massachusetts and in Maryland. The Maryland area, New Scotland Hundred, eventually became the city of Washington DC. The Maryland Trails also held estates in what are now Montgomery County and Frederick County. The name also spread to Louisiana, Alabama, and other parts of the southern United States. The name \\"Traille\\" is recorded in the Cajun community in the southern United States.  Later dispersion  In the 19th century the sons of Robert Traill settled in Argentina, where his grandson Johnny Traill became the first Irish-Argentine 10-goal polo player. Other branches of the family settled in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  In literature  The book Silver RiverSilver River, Fourth Estate, 2007https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview11 by Daisy Goodwin gives a partly fictionalised account of the fortunes of her branch of the Traill family from her great-great-great-grandfather, Rector Robert Traill of Skull during the Great Famine of Ireland via their emigration to Argentina to herself in an attempt to understand her relationship with her mother, Jocasta Innes.

It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in the parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District. History The Music Room The engraving of Œø·Ωê œÜœÅŒøŒΩœÑ·Ω∂œÇ over doorway The small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century. The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription Œø·Ωê œÜœÅŒøŒΩœÑ·Ω∂œÇ (\\"Why Worry\\"). It is now a Grade II* listed building as \\"Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)\\"; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015. Lawrence first rented the cottage in 1923 while stationed at nearby Bovington Camp with the Tank Corps. He made it habitable with the help of a friend, then bought it in 1925 and used it as a holiday home. He described it as an earthly paradise and wrote \\"Nothing in Clouds Hill is to be a care upon the world. While I have it there shall be nothing exquisite or unique in it. Nothing to anchor me.\\" The cottage had no electric lights and three living rooms, described as an eating room, book room and music room. For heat insulation Lawrence had the eating room lined with asbestos that was covered in aluminium foil, and he kept his food under glass domes. In the book room he installed a large leather divan, and in the music room above it he had his gramophone \\"with a huge amplifier horn\\", a leather sofa and chair. In 1935 Lawrence left the Royal Air Force and lived at Clouds Hill. A few weeks later, at the age of 46, he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident close to the cottage, and died in the Bovington Camp hospital on 19 May 1935. The following year, his heir, his brother A. W. Lawrence, gave Clouds Hill to the National Trust. It is now a museum, dedicated to Lawrence. It is open to visitors from March to the beginning of October, seven days a week, from 11am to 5pm. The cottage remains largely as Lawrence left it at his death. It features an exhibition detailing Lawrence's life, and most of his original furniture and possessions. The cottage reflects his complex personality and links to the Middle East. The circular Lawrence of Arabia Trail starts and finishes at Bovington's The Tank Museum, taking in Clouds Hill and the churchyard of St Nicholas' Church in Moreton, Lawrence's final resting place.Lawrence of Arabia Trail Sleeping bags The rear of the cottage alt= Lawrence reserved a sleeping bag for visitors who stayed overnight. His own sleeping bag was marked meum ('mine' in Latin) and the bag for a guest, tuum ('yours'). In 1965 the visitor's bag was stolen. Its disappearance coincided with the release of the film Lawrence of Arabia and it was thought the theft could have been inspired by the publicity generated by the film. The sleeping bag was returned anonymously in 2001.

Haplogroup L1 is a human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. It is most common in Central Africa and West Africa. It diverged from L1-6 at about 140,000 years ago ( 95% CI). Its emergence is associated with the early peopling of Africa by anatomically modern humans during the Eemian, and it is now mostly found in African pygmies. Distribution Haplogroup L1 is found most commonly in Central Africa and West Africa. It reaches its highest frequency among the Mbenga Pygmies. It is likely that it was formerly more widespread, and was constrained to its current area as a result of the Bantu migration (which is largely associated with haplogroup L2). Haplogroup L1 has been observed in specimens from the island cemetery in Kulubnarti, Sudan, which date from the Early Christian period (AD 550‚Äì800). An ancient Beaker culture individual at the Camino de las Yeseras in Spain (San Fernando de Henares, Madrid; [I4245 / RISE695] F) has also been found to carry the L1b1a mitochondrial haplogroup.I√±igo Olalde et al.

University of Virginia, Department of Physics. and John Locke. Overview Corpuscularianism is similar to the theory of atomism, except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards the production of gold by transmutation. Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: \\"secondary\\" qualities as distinguished from \\"primary\\" qualities.The Mechanical Philosophy - Early modern 'atomism' (\\"corpuscularianism\\" as it was known) Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory for centuries and was blended with alchemy by early scientists such as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton in the 17th century. In his work The Sceptical Chymist (1661), Boyle abandoned the Aristotelian ideas of the classical elements‚Äîearth, water, air, and fire‚Äîin favor of corpuscularianism. In his later work, The Origin of Forms and Qualities (1666), Boyle used corpuscularianism to explain all of the major Aristotelian concepts, marking a departure from traditional Aristotelianism. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes used corpuscularianism to justify his political theories in Leviathan. It was used by Newton in his development of the corpuscular theory of light, while Boyle used it to develop his mechanical corpuscular philosophy, which laid the foundations for the Chemical Revolution. Alchemical corpuscularianism William R. Newman traces the origins from the fourth book of Aristotle, Meteorology.Late medieval and early modern corpuscular matter theories Volume 1 of Medieval and Early Modern Science, Christoph L√ºthy, J. E. Murdoch, William R. Newman BRILL, 2001, p. 306 The \\"dry\\" and \\"moist\\" exhalations of Aristotle became the alchemical 'sulfur' and 'mercury' of the eighth-century Islamic alchemist, JƒÅbir ibn HayyƒÅn (721‚Äì815). Pseudo-Geber's Summa perfectionis contains an alchemical theory where unified sulfur and mercury corpuscles, differing in purity, size, and relative proportions, form the basis of a much more complicated process. Importance to the development of modern scientific theory Several of the principles which corpuscularianism proposed became tenets of modern chemistry. *The idea that compounds can have secondary properties that differ from the properties of the elements which are combined to make them became the basis of molecular chemistry. *The idea that the same elements can be predictably combined in different ratios using different methods to create compounds with radically different properties became the basis of stoichiometry, crystalography, and established studies of chemical synthesis. *The ability of chemical processes to alter the composition of an object without significantly altering its form is the basis of fossil theory via mineralization and the understanding of numerous metallurgical, biological, and geological processes.

It was designed and built by NSW Government Railways. It is also known as Valley Heights Railway Station and Locomotive Depot and The Valley. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The Valley Heights railway station . The Great Western Railway went through Valley Heights in 1867. The platform opened in 1875 to service the private residence, The Valley Inn, of the Colonial Treasurer, the Hon. Geoffrey Eager M.L.A. / M.L.C. The station opened in May 1875 as Eagers Platform. Public facilities and a waiting shed were erected in 1877 and the name was changed from Eagar's Platform to The Valley in 1877; and again to Valley Heights on 19 August 1880.Valley Heights Station NSWrail.net The line was duplicated in 1902, when the present brick platform building opened. Virtually every station between Emu Plains and Lithgow received the same style of Federation structure when the Western line was duplicated between 1898 and 1912. Valley Heights formerly had a yard and locomotive servicing facilities. Until January 1989 it provided locomotives to assist trains up the heavily graded section of the line to Katoomba. The western line was electrified to Valley Heights on 23 October 1956. From 2 February 1957 steam operations from Valley Heights were replaced by the 46 class electric locomotives which assisted trains from Valley Heights to Katoomba. From that train all steam hauled trains, both freight and passenger were electrically assisted to Katoomba, until complete electrification saw steam removed from the scene. The former depot still exists and is now maintained as the Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum. The pedestrian bridge dates from 1901. The deck is supported by steel beams but the stringers are supported by a truss. The bridge underwent upgrading work in 1992 with a concrete deck and stairs. The station originally had a gatekeeper's cottage which was demolished after 1902. The brick and timber signal box was opened in 1913 but badly destroyed by bush fire in 1951. The interlocking frame was moved to a lower level and the box continued operating until 1995. The signal box has continued to be occupied by a branch of the NSW Rail Transport Museum. Valley Heights Locomotive Depot (VHLD) was also completed in 1913, and officially opened on 31 January 1914. The establishment of a new locomotive depot allowed for assistant engines to be attached there (instead of Penrith) for the climb to Katoomba. The engines at Valley Heights not only piloted over the longest distance in NSW, but also had the distinction of having to operate over the longest continual and most steeply graded mainline in Australia. During the peak of the steam era an average of 30 trains during any 24 hour period required a pilot engine from the depot. From 1913, Valley Heights became an important railway centre and most of the buildings that exist in the depot date from the opening and early period; the ten stall sector roundhouse, a 60' turntable and new offices and sidings were built in 1913, followed by a Station Master's residence and a night-officer's house in 1914. The depot also includes a water tank and archaeological remains of various structures. The depot continued in operation as a steam locomotive depot until February 1957 when electric locomotive running commenced. The change to electric traction (46 class locomotives) was associated with the electrification of the Main Western line to Lithgow which was completed in late 1957. While the role of the depot in providing pilot engines remained unchanged, the now redundant steam servicing facilities were removed. The pilot engine role of the depot continued into the early 1980s until the placing in service of more powerful electric locomotives (the 85 and 86 classes). Over the intervening years the role of the depot had expanded to include servicing, repair and overhaul of electric locomotives and also goods wagons. In 1989 the depot was closed and was used to store and service track maintenance material until 1993 when the State Rail Authority (SRA) vacated the site. In 1994 the Blue Mountains Division of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum established the Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Railway Museum with the aim of preserving the depot to provide historical, educational and recreational facilities and opportunities for the benefit of the Blue Mountains community and visitor to the region. The Valley Heights Steam Tramway was established in 1997 by the Stream Tram and Railway Preservation (Co-Op) Society Limited. The locomotive depot continues to be occupied by the NSW Rail Transport Museum. Platforms and services Valley Heights train station platform sign Valley Heights has one island platform with two sides. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow.  Description  The station precinct comprises a type 11, initial island/side platform brick station building, erected in 1902; a brick lamp room/store, erected in 1902; a signal box, erected in 1910. Other station precinct structures include a concrete over brick face platform, erected in 1902; and a standard steel beam on trestles footbridge, over the main up line track and platform, erected in 1901 and modified in 1992. The locomotive depot precinct comprises a 10 road roundhouse, erected in 1913 and extended 1973; a machine workshop; a members' room/meal room; a members' locker room/toilet; a passageway; a former chargeman's office/district locomotive engineer's (DLE) office, erected in 1913; a former amenities building, erected in 1930; a toilet block, erected in 1965; an air compressor shed; a red brick fuel store, erected in 1970; and a shed, erected in 2008. Other locomotive depot structures include a steel turntable, erected in 1914 and modified in 1967; an ash disposal tunnel and pits, erected in 1913; locomotive watering facilities, erected in 1924; trackwork, completed in 1914; trestling foundations, erected in ; and overhead catenary masts, erected in 1957. Station precinct ;Station building (1902) External: Constructed of face brick with corrugated metal gabled roof extending as an awning in the form of broken back to both platforms, the Valley Heights station building is an early phase type 11 initial island/side platform building in standard Federation free classical style design. It has a 6 bay linear arrangement along the platform with tuckpointed brickwork and engaged piers between the bays. Distinctive features are red face brickwork with rendered and moulded two rows of string courses to both rail elevations, timber framed windows and doors with contrasting decorative rendered trims and sills, standard iron brackets over decorative corbels supporting ample platform awnings, fretted timber work to both ends of awnings and gable ends, two tall corbelled chimneys one of which with terracotta pots, timber framed double-hung windows with multi-paned and coloured upper sashes and toughened glass bottom sashes, and timber door openings with multi-paned fanlights with coloured glazing. A face brick privacy wall screens the Men's toilet entry at the eastern end of the building. Two roof vents also exist above the toilet bays. All windows and doors are secured by metal gates and grills. An air-conditioning unit has been installed on the fanlight of the Station Master's office door. Internal: The station building appears to have maintained most of its original detailing and finishes despite the changes over the time. The original floor layout remains including parcels office and Station Master's office with ticket window looking over the general waiting room, and toilets including an accessible toilet at eastern end. The interiors generally feature custom orb ceilings with ceiling roses, enclosed or adapted fireplaces, moulded picture rails and cornices to the general waiting room, decorative cast iron wall vents, later floor tiling or carpet finish, and timber bead style moulded cornices. All toilet and light fittings are relatively new. The Platform 1 door of the general waiting room and the ladies toilet door have also been fitted with a solid panel at the back. ;Lamp room / store (1902) External: A small square shaped brick shed featuring moulded and rendered string course detailing similar to the main station building. It is located on the west side of the station building towards the end of the platform and is separated visually from the main station building by the stairs leading to the footbridge. The shed features a gabled corrugated metal roof with timber bargeboard and narrow eaves with exposed rafters, contrasting rendered moulded trim above two single doors on east and west side elevations and a band of string course throughout all elevations. There are no other openings on the building and the existing doors have been secured by metal gates. Internal: The former lamp room is currently used as a storage area and features face brick walls with exposed roof truss structure within the corrugated metal roof. The timber boarded door is in the form of a sliding loading door with a fanlight above. ;Signal box (1910) The signal box was originally built in 1910, constructed with three storeys, two in brick with the upper level constructed in timber cladding. The building was accessed via an external timber stair, on the western side of the building. It was severely damaged by fire in 1951 and the top floor collapsed. A roof was placed on top of the remaining brickwork and a new frame was placed into service on the ground floor. The first floor level of brickwork was removed in 1987 and steel / urethane sandwich addition was added at the same time for staff amenities. Use of the signal box was discontinued in 1994 and given to the museum. Corrugated metal roofing fabric is relatively new. The signal equipment including CTC panel and 37 lever interlocking frame inside are extant. The building currently presents a single-storey box with shallow hipped roof. The face brickwork with engaged piers has been painted over in places and the three arched windows along the railway side are intact, although the panes have been painted over and many are broken. The 1987 steel / urethane sandwich extension addition is extensively damaged by white ants. ;Platform (1902) Valley Heights station has an island platform in elliptical curved form, which is wide at the centre and narrow at both ends of the platform. This form is typical of Blue Mountains stations dictated by the topography and the deviation of the railway line. The platform is concrete faced (possible rendered over brick retaining wall) with concrete projecting edge at the top and asphalt finish to the deck. Modern platform furniture including light fittings, signage, timber bench seating and aluminium palisade fencing at both ends of the platform are other features along the platform. ;Footbridge (1901, 1992) Valley Heights Station footbridge is a modified standard steel beam bridge supported on steel trestles extending from the street ramp over the highway and over the Up main tracks with stairs to the island platform between the main station building and the lamp room. The sections beyond the Up main tracks over the highway are a later addition constructed in c.1992 of concrete beam with concrete columns. With the exception of original steel structure and trussed stair stringers (balustrade), it appears that all components of the bridge have been replaced during the 1992 upgrading works.  Locomotive depot  ;Roundhouse (1913, extended 1973) External: The roundhouse building comprises a 1913 main roundhouse and a workshop annex. The roundhouse consisted of 10 bays for the stabling and servicing of steam locomotives, which remains intact to date. The design style of the building incorporates a symmetrically shaped, peaked roof profile with a relatively small ventilating ridge or clerestory gable roof at the centre of the roof peak, approximately 2 feet (600mm) above the main roof. The roundhouse is approximately 65 feet 4 inches in depth (front columns to rear wall). It is constructed with an Oregon timber structural frame with hardwood timber supporting posts (ironbark). The roof is covered by corrugated iron which was originally covered with asbestos tiles or slates, and later with super 6 corrugated fibro. Internal: Flooring is bedded dry pressed common brick, topped in cement slurry, and there is a section of the flooring where the original brickwork is exposed in bay 10 adjacent to the easternmost wall. The brickwork of the pit walling was originally bagged with lime slurry and featured drainage outlets to all pits. Some of the pits have since been infilled in association with the change to electric over steam locomotives. Smoke chutes were provided at the front and rear but the front were removed prior to 1950 leaving only chutes on the southern or western side of the building enabling ventilation as all locomotives were first taken into the shed. Further ventilation is aided by the clerestory roof. The end walls are fully sheeted with corrugated iron, as is the rear wall below the 7 foot level. Above the iron on the rear walls are Oregon timber window frames, in a multi light awning style (hopper) operated on Austral stays. These sashes alternate with multi light fixed sashes. The bulk of the window frames had been removed for repair and reinstatement. Some windows have also been removed at the western portion of the roundhouse, in association with the construction of the lean to additions. ;Machine workshop (1973) The workshop is constructed in timber and clad in corrugated iron wall and roof sheeting. Sited to the rear of bay 1 of the Roundhouse as an annex, the rail line and track has been extended into the workshop allowing access to rolling stock for repair. The workshop also features a single storey concrete element at the rear and southern side, currently used as a tool store. This is to become a welding bay. The workshop houses machinery used for the restoration of exhibits, e.g. lathes, drills, gantry crane, mills and grinders etc. ;Members' room / meal room The members' room is located to the rear of Bay 5. Like most of the 1960s lean to additions, the room is clad externally in corrugated sheeting and also features timber framed vertically proportioned and double hung hopper windows. Internally the room is clad in hard board sheeting with plasterboard ceiling. Examination of the fabric of the room suggests a further extension to the rear though the dating of this further addition is unknown. The room is used largely as a meeting and meal room for members, with full kitchen facilities installed. ;Members' locker room / toilet The walls and roofing of the shower and toilet are clad in fibro sheeting, with a timber structure supporting the roof cladding. The walls and roofing of the locker room are clad in hard board sheeting, some of which is hanging down exposing insulation. The area is currently used for storage of ladders and other materials. ;Passageway The walls and roofing of the corridor are clad in corrugated iron, with timber structure supporting the roof cladding. The area is currently used as a store; however the space was originally constructed as an external access from the rear of the roundhouse on the south side of the site. The timber door is extant however unused. ;Former charwoman's office / District locomotive engineer's (DLE) office (1913) External: The former office building has recently been restored and now accommodates the museum displays. It is constructed of an Oregon timber frame, supported by brick piers and with A gable roof clad in corrugated steel sheeting. It is rectangular in shape and features simple bargeboards and timber framed louvered ventilation window to the gable ends. A skillion roofed corrugated steel verandah supported on steel round posts covers the front of the building over a concrete slab. The front elevation is fenestrated by three identical timber doors with fanlight. The windows on the rear elevation are also timber framed with a box frame hardwood sill. Internal: The office maintains its original layout of three rooms that originally were separate but now are connected to each other by door openings. The internal features include tongue and grooved hardwood floor with carpet finish, timber weatherboard wall cladding to full wall height with a splayed and chamfered profile, simple timber skirting and timber board ceiling linings. Security bars are fixed to the interiors of the windows in order to ensure the safety of the collections. Metal picture rails are fixed to the walls for the exhibition of the picture collections. The light fittings are modern pendant style. ;Former amenities building (, extended 1960) The building is constructed of rusticated weatherboard with a hipped, corrugated steel roof. Originally rectangular, the building now forms a U-shape with wings and a courtyard. Double-hung windows with multi-pane fenestration are generally vertically proportioned (some in groups) and the frames are timber box frame type with hardwood sills. The main entry is via a projecting skillion roofed partially enclosed porch with original timber framed and glass panelled doors. A brick chimney is the only feature of the roofscape. A metal picket fence separates the courtyard from the track, which is used for the visitors' locomotive experience within the yard. Internal: Internally the walls and ceilings are lined with plasterboard panels with Oregon timber architraves and skirtings. The floors are concrete with linoleum and carpet finish. The internal doors are later fabric and are made of lightweight hollow core panels with timber frame. The amenities building consists of five rooms, used in the current facility as a library, museum shop for the sale of books, souvenirs and ephemera, a general storage room, a refreshments room, model railway room and one room is used for local Historical Society displays. The building has been adapted and extended from the former amenities facility which was a much smaller building incorporating a locker room, meal room and office facilities. ;Toilet block (, extended 2006) A rectangular part face brick part timber framed utility building with corrugated steel gabled roof. It comprises male, female and disabled toilets with privacy walls/partitions to the front. Floors are concrete with tile finish and the fittings are generally new. The majority of the partition walls were replaced as part of the 2006 restoration works and the building was repainted. ;Air compressor shed (2005-6) The air compressor shed is located at the top of the bank adjacent to the Main Western Line and overlooking the Roundhouse. The simple building, which features concrete block flooring, steel structural framing and galvanised iron wall and roof cladding, with pitched roof form, is of recent construction. The building features two roller doors to the western elevation, with aluminium louvered ventilation at the eastern elevation. The shed building replaced an earlier termite damaged building of the same purpose on the site. ;Fuel store (1970) The building is of 1970s red brick construction, with flat roof form, sited to the rear of the open storage yard behind the machine workshop and roundhouse. The building houses dangerous and flammable liquids and accordingly is set well back from the main building zone at the site. Internal access was not available (2009). ;Workshop shed (2008) New large steel framed corrugated steel shed with corrugated steel gabled roof featuring a lantern along the ridgeline for additional ventilation and light. Sections of the roof are of clear corrugated sheeting for improved light. The shed is essentially a large single space in portal style framing with large multi-paned steel windows on both long side elevations while the narrow elevations featuring roller doors to allow easy entry for the locomotives via two sets of siding. ;Turntable (1914, 1967) The 60-foot turntable enables the locating of locomotives onto the respective roads in the roundhouse or for the turning of the locomotives. The turntable is constructed in steel and features timber sleepers at the perimeter of the turning circle. The element is manually operated and is still in use. It is the third such turntable to be used at the site, having been relocated from Katoomba in the 1960s. Examination of the fabric of the infrastructure suggests some repair to the steel plating of the turntable. The turntable pit originally featured tracks on the northern side of the circle, enabling the locomotive to overshoot the turning circle with no damage to the locomotive. The tracks and associated timbers, however, were removed after the circle was damaged as a result of vandalism. ;Ask disposal tunnel and pits (1913) The ash disposal tunnel is a below-ground-level structure constructed between the running rails of the access and departure roads with two covered ground-level pits. The tunnel was constructed to facilitate the removal of ash from the smoke boxes of the steam locomotives. This required the ash to be raked and shovelled out by hand. The ash would then drop into the tunnel, and a narrow gauge line with hand- operated trolleys was provided in the tunnel for removing the ash as it dropped from the pits. The pits were in use until 1957, when steam operations ceased in the mountains. The tunnel is extant, along with the internal track work for the trolley, and recent landscaping works have uncovered two sets of stone stairs either side of the tunnel entry. The external entry was painted, and it is also likely that the internal brickwork was originally painted or lime-washed. ;Locomotive watering facilities (1924) The complete assemblage of the watering facilities still awaits re-instatement. The water tank has been relocated from ELCAR Workshops and is a 5,000 gallon example. Of standard local design, the tank is of high technical significance and is representative of the many tanks formally seen at depots around the former NSWGR system. The tank would likely have been constructed by the railways in Newcastle. The water column is of a standard pattern though of later design and is representative of the post WWII railway. The restoration of the column on its restored piers and adjacent to the 1914 drainage pit is proposed in near future. ;Trackwork (1914) The current track diagram is a remnant of the former depot layout from the steam era. They are proposed to be restored by reconnecting the arrival and departure roads to a more closely resemble the trackwork of the steam era. ;Trestling foundation () These are remnant foundations of the former coaling plant and demonstrate the scale, design and context of the former coaling plant. ;Overhead catenary masts (1957) The remnant overhead masts are a type of overhead system used in the form of the 46-class electric locomotives demonstrating the arrival of modern motive power in the depot. The masts in the yard are of the first generation design; fabricated, riveted, mild steel preserved with a micaceous paint system. ;Moveable items The following moveable items have been observed at Valley Heights Station: * A safe (ID #749) with no brand name dating possibly from the 1960s is located in the booking office. * Two early timber bench style seats in the General Waiting Room. * An early ticket window desk in the ticket office. There are a large number of moveable items that belong to the Valley Heights Museum. A Seth Thomas clock has been observed in the model rail room of the Former Amenities Building. ;Landscape features Apart from a couple of garden beds with shrubs and small plantings along the north and south ends of the platform there is no landscaping at the station. The existing station landscaping is not considered significant. The locomotive depot site has built up gradually with deposits from the ash spoil dump and the site features large concrete retaining walls reinforced with railway sleepers along the southern portion of the site adjacent to the access road. The site incorporates a number of established mature tree and shrub plantings as well as many new plantings dating to the period of occupation of the current tenants. There are also a high proportion of established trees concentrated on the southern side of the Roundhouse. Plantings include a wide variety of native and non indigenous species, including wattle, eucalypts, angophora floribunda (rough barked apple), grevillea and callistemon (bottlebrush) as well as some pine and cedar species. ;Potential archeological features There is high archaeological potential within the locomotive depot site due to the existence of remnant sidings, ash tunnels and trestles foundations.  Condition  The station building is generally in good condition with minor repair work requirements for repointing and repainting; the lamp room/store is generally in good condition. Some cracks are evident on the eastern wall at the lock height have been observed - possibly result of incompatible cement mortar repairs. The signal box is in moderate to poor condition; the platform and footbridge are both in good condition. The locomotive depot is generally in good condition. Despite being vacant for a number of years prior to the current tenants, the RTM has subsequently undertaken a systematic program of restoration works over time. The roundhouse has undergone some roof replacement, and replacement of the glass in some of the windows. The Chargeman's Office has recently undergone significant restoration works and is in very good condition. The former amenities building, toilet block, and air compressor shed are all in very good condition. The fuel store is in good condition. The workshop shed is in very good condition. The turntable, ash disposal tunnel and pits, locomotive watering facilities, trackwork, trestling foundations, and overhead catenary masts are all in moderate condition. The station buildings are intact externally with minor changes to the internal finishes. The station has a high degree of integrity. The locomotive depot site maintains a reasonable level of integrity in terms of the composition and layout of its buildings and structures, though some changes have taken place. Roundhouse: Externally, the building retains its typical and original appearance. Even though its original purpose (the servicing of steam locomotives) has been altered to suit newer motive power, with a subsequent change to work methods and equipment, the integrity of the roundhouse has been retained. Internally, the building retains a high degree of integrity due to the retention of original construction features and details. The Chargeman's Office is of moderate integrity; the former amenities building is of high integrity; the toilet block is of moderate integrity; the air compressor shed, fuel store, workshop shed, turntable, and the ash disposal tunnel and pits are all of high integrity; the locomotive watering facilities are of moderate integrity; the trackwork is of moderate integrity; the trestling foundations are of moderate integrity; and the overhead catenary masts are of moderate integrity.

Transport links Blue Mountains Transit operates one route via Valley Heights station: *690P: Springwood station to Penrith station  Heritage listing  As at 18 November 2010, the Valley Heights railway station is of state significance as part of the early construction phase of railway line duplication and deviation between Glenbrook and Springwood demonstrating the technological and engineering achievements in railway construction at the beginning of the 1900s. The station has strong associations with the adjacent Locomotive Depot and is also evidence of development in Valley Heights maintaining its landmark quality within the non-urban townscape. The station building together with the matching lamp room is a good example of a standard island platform building and demonstrates typical architectural elements of the Federation free classical style station buildings that were built across the Blue Mountains with the duplication of the railway line in 1902. The Valley Heights Locomotive Depot is of state significance as an important locomotive depot, and the principal service and maintenance facility for bank engines working over the Main Western line between Sydney and Lithgow for almost 80 years. The collection of buildings and structures including the roundhouse, former chargeman's office, amenities building, turntable, ash disposal tunnel and pits, locomotive watering facilities, trackwork, trestling foundations and overhead catenary masts provide insight into the workings of an important transport and freight hub at the height of its operation. The place also has a strong industrial aesthetic quality and is of technical and research significance providing valuable information about the age of steam. The roundhouse building is rare in NSW, being the third roundhouse constructed by the NSW Government Railways, and now the oldest of only seven other remaining roundhouses in the state. This style of building is unique to the railways and there are some building elements of the roundhouse that are unique, principally the roof form, which was not used at any of the other roundhouse sites. The site has a high level of social significance given its contribution to the development of the town historically, and more importantly, as demonstrated by the strong and continued community interest and involvement with the site. The depot is affiliated with three community and volunteer groups, indicating a strong sense of community involvement and ownership of the site. Valley Heights railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Depot was the first modern depot in NSW. It is the only complete depot built at one time in NSW. The Depot is the only depot built on a curve and in such a restricted area. It was the first depot to have an elevated coal stage on the Western line in NSW. The Depot was the only Depot to utilise parachute style water tanks for watering locomotives on the Western line. The ash disposal method utilised was the most modern in use at the time of being built and is unique to Valley Heights.The NSW Rail Transport Museum, 2000 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Valley Heights railway station is aesthetically significant as a good example of the Federation free classical style as used for public and institutional buildings. The station includes both the main building and the lamp building which have been built in matching style and details. Valley Heights Locomotive Depot is aesthetically significant because of the original fabric and intact architectural features of the 1914 built roundhouse. This style of building is unique to railway buildings and there are some building elements of the site and roundhouse that are unique even to the Valley Heights site, principally the roof form, which was not used at any of the other roundhouse sites. The building also has an aesthetic quality characteristic of roundhouse sites and strongly reflects the industrial character of the site and the occupation by the Railways. The associated buildings and structures including former Chargeman's office, former amenities building, turntable, trackwork, overhead catenary masts, and trestling foundations contribute to the overall aesthetic quality and setting of the depot. The landscaping enhances the setting with its highly established leafy surroundings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Valley Heights Locomotive Depot has social significance because when the site was vacated by the NSW government, there was significant community interest in retention and conservation of the site as a museum and restorative facility. The site is now tenanted by the Blue Mountains Division of the Rail Transport Museum and is staffed almost entirely by volunteers, indicating a strong local community attachment and interest. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The locomotive site is of technical and research significance because the roundhouse and its equipment are the remnants of a past era, located in an area of the state where railways played so much a part in development and essential transport of goods and passengers. As one of the very few surviving railway roundhouses, the complex gives valuable information about the age of steam. The depot at Valley Heights provides an insight into the workings of an important transport and freight hub at the height of its operation. The signal box is also of research significance due to its ability in providing evidence of its associated signalling equipment and very limited ability on the construction techniques and architectural character of an originally three-storey brick signal box via its remnant ground floor structure. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Valley Heights Station Group is a representative example of an island platform with footbridge created in response to the duplication of the line in 1902 incorporating a good example of a group of Federation free classical style standard station buildings. This type of island platform station building with lamp room were commonly used later during 1910s and 1920s. The footbridge, although refurbished, is representative of steel footbridges with trussed stair stringers that survive today. The signal box is no longer representative of its type as its original form has been lost. Valley Heights Locomotive Depot is a representative example of such a facility reflecting typical composition of a locomotive depot and principal characteristics of associated buildings, including form, construction methods, materials and operating components. The site reflects a typical locomotive depot layout and composition, and while the site has been compromised to some extant through the removal of certain elements and the addition of new facilities, it is still possible to ascertain the original workings of the depot. Valley Heights roundhouse represents a class of industrial building which has almost disappeared from the state. The associated buildings and structures including former Chargeman's office, former amenities building, turntable, trackwork, overhead catenary masts, trestling foundations are all individually representative of their type.

Released in Germany for MS-DOS in April 1996, and in the United Kingdom and North America in August, it is the second game in The Settlers series, following The Settlers (1993). In December, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers II Mission CD, featuring new single-player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, and a map editor. In October 1997, they released The Settlers II: Gold Edition, containing the original game, plus the Mission CD expansion, along with minor graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks. The Gold Edition was also ported to Mac OS in 1997. In 2006, an enhanced remake, The Settlers II (10th Anniversary), was released for Microsoft Windows. In 2007, the Gold Edition was ported to the Nintendo DS, under the title The Settlers, released in Germany in July, and in the United Kingdom and North America in August. Although adapted for the dual-screen display of the DS, and with controls specifically programmed for use with the DS stylus, the gameplay, game mechanics, graphics and storyline are unaltered. In 2009, the original Gold Edition was released on GOG.com, and in 2018, it was re-released for Microsoft Windows as The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici - History Edition. The game can be played in either single-player campaign mode or in \\"Free game\\" mode; individual scenarios with predetermined rules set by the player, which can be played with or against either another player, the computer, or both another player and the computer. In the single-player campaign, the player controls a group of Romans who are shipwrecked on an uncharted island. Led by their captain, Octavius, they must use a series of magical portals to try to find their way back to the Empire. During their travels, they come into conflict with Nubians, Vikings and Japanese. In the single-player campaign included with the Mission CD, the player controls Octavius's great-grandson as he attempts to conquer the entire world. In making The Settlers II, Blue Byte wanted to improve upon the first Settlers title to as much of an extent and in as many ways as they could. To this end, they sought fan feedback from the first game, and hired Thomas H√§user, who had worked on quality assurance for The Settlers, as the lead designer. Although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same as in the first game, many other aspects of the gameplay and game mechanics have been altered. For example, the sound effects and graphics have been enhanced, with more on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, and with four aesthetically distinct races; the economic system is more complex; the battle system is more strategic, with the player able to use scouts and stationary offensive weaponry; and a story-driven single-player campaign has been included. The original game received positive reviews, with critics especially praising the supply and demand gameplay, the complex economic system and the graphics. The most common criticisms were the lack of direct control during combat, and the absence of an online multiplayer mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over 600,000 units worldwide, considerably more than the original Settlers. The DS remake received negative reviews, with many critics arguing it tarnished the legacy of the original, citing unresponsive controls, a poorly implemented HUD, and, especially, game breaking bugs. Gameplay The Settlers II is a city-building game with real-time strategy elements, in which the primary goal on each map is to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of either the entire map, or a certain predetermined section of it. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. The game is controlled via a point and click interface, and features a HUD navigated primarily through \\"windows\\" modeled on Windows 95. Game modes The game can be played in one of two modes; \\"Campaign\\" or \\"Free Game\\". In the single-player Campaign mode, the player must complete a series of missions, the goal of each of which is to defeat the computer controlled opponent or opponents by gaining possession of the territory in which the mission objective is located. In the original release of the game, there were ten missions, with the player limited to controlling the Romans. The Mission CD expansion added a new campaign of nine missions, with the player once again confined to controlling the Romans. In Free Game mode, the player chooses a map on which to play, and then refines the game in various ways, such as selecting the number of races (from two to four), choosing which race to control (Romans, Nubians, Vikings or Japanese), selecting the victory conditions (how much of the map must be controlled), refining the amount of raw materials available to each player at the start of the game, and determining if each race begins in a predetermined spot, or is instead placed randomly on the map. The player can also select the type of game to be played, choosing from \\"Every man for himself\\", \\"Human vs. Computer\\" and \\"People vs. People\\". This allows for a variety of different game types, such as two human controlled races against one computer controlled race (and vice versa), two human controlled races against two computer controlled races, two human and two computer controlled races all fighting one another, and two human controlled races competing against one another. Games involving two human players are played in split screen, with the second player using a mouse on the same PC. Settlers and transportation Whether playing in Campaign or Free Game mode, each game begins the same way; the player has one building, a warehouse/headquarters, in which are a set amount of raw materials and tools. The basic gameplay revolves around serfs (the titular \\"settlers\\") who transport materials, tools and produce, and who populate and perform the requisite task of each building. As the player constructs buildings and thus requires settlers to occupy them, the settlers automatically emerge from the warehouse as needed. As the settlement continues to grow in size, the warehouse's quota of settlers will eventually be reached, and the player will need to build an additional warehouse to generate more settlers. At no point does the player directly control any individual settler - instead, general orders are issued (such as ordering the construction of a building), with the AI handling the delegation of orders to specific settlers. Screenshot of The Settlers II, showing the \\"Activity window\\", which allows players to construct buildings. The HUD also shows part of the player's settlement, with the various buildings linked by roads. The roads are demarcated by waypoints (blue flags), which function as hubs for the distribution of goods, with a single settler operating between each flag. An important game mechanic is the construction of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, select the \\"build road\\" option, and then place another flag. The computer will then automatically find the best route between the two and build the road, although the player is also free to build the road manually. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and set it down, at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of boats (can transport goods over small stretches of water), and ships (can transport goods across oceans). Economy The economy is under the player's control throughout the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting how much of a given resource is transported to a given building, under six separate headings; foodstuff, grain, iron, coal, boards and water. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a bakery, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, a rolling pin will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. Military The player's territory can only be expanded by building a military complex near the territory border. Each complex must have at least one soldier garrisoned for the territory to expand. Soldiers are automatically created from the pool of existing settlers in the headquarters, with each individual soldier requiring a sword, shield, and one unit of beer. Once soldiers are garrisoned, gold coins can be transported to the building to increase their rank. The player can also build lookout towers, which can see for great distances, but don't grant new territory. The player also has control over the structure of their military, and is free to change the number of settlers who become soldiers, the rank of first-line defence soldiers, how many soldiers from each building can be used offensively, how many soldiers counter the enemy if nearby buildings are attacked, and how many soldiers take up positions in buildings in the settlement's centre, further out, and on the borders. In order for the player to attack an enemy building, they must click on that building, and select both the number of units and what rank they wish to use to carry out the attack. If the player's units defeat all soldiers stationed in the building, they will occupy it, with the player's territory increasing according to the building's radius. The player can also use catapults to attack enemy military buildings. Catapults are immobile, and fire stones at enemy buildings within their range, with each successful hit killing one occupying soldier. If all soldiers are killed, the building burns down, and the enemy loses the territory controlled by that building. Defense of the player's military buildings is automatic; as enemies attack, any soldiers stationed in the building defend. Plot The game begins in the fourth year of the reign of Emperor Travianus Augustus Caesar, as Octavius, a captain in the Roman navy, is sailing his ship, the Tortius, through the dangerous \\"Sea of Storms\\" to the \\"Latonic Provinces\\". However, the ship is hit by a sudden storm, thrown off-course, and, after several days, driven onto the coastline of an island, marooning the crew. Octavius quickly deduces the island is unknown to the Empire, and thus, rescue is unlikely. However, seeing a plentiful supply of food, the crew decide to settle on the island. Setting out to explore, they discover a gateway-like structure with a Latin inscription, \\"Consiste ut procederas\\" (\\"Settle down in order to make progress\\"). Perplexed at the contradictory nature of this message, they continue to build up their settlement. Thirteen months later, a portal opens in the gateway, and Octavius concludes the inscription means that for the gateway to function, they must first construct a vibrant settlement. Entering the portal, they are transported to another island, and after several months, find evidence of Nubian inhabitants. The Nubians greet the Romans peacefully, telling them about their \\"holy relic\\", which Octavius realises is another portal. He asks for access to it, but the Nubians refuse, and Octavius determines to take it by force. After five months of fighting, the Romans defeat the Nubians, and enter the portal. Over the next few years, as they use a series of portals to jump from island to island, they come into conflict with more Nubians, as well as Vikings and Japanese, before eventually emerging on what they believe to be the final island on their journey home. Ten years after being shipwrecked, they locate the final portal, but are shocked to learn it is guarded by hostile Romans. However, they are able to fight their way through, finally returning to the Empire. Development Blue Byte had always intended to make a sequel to The Settlers if it proved successful. A commercial success, by June 1996, the original game had sold over 215,000 units, considerably more than expected, and so Blue Byte immediately began development on a second game, with a total of twelve people working on the project. As well as enhancing the graphics and sound effects, and increasing the complexity of the supply and demand-based gameplay, there were also certain aspects of the original with which Blue Byte had been unhappy, and which they hoped to address in the sequel. They also sought feedback from fans of the first game, and worked to deal with anything the fanbase disliked or felt could be improved upon. However, Volker Wertich, who had designed and programmed the original, was not involved with the second game, because, as he describes it, \\"after two years programming The Settlers, I didn't really want to see those little men for a while.\\" It was Blue Byte's desire to improve upon any aspects of the first game which they felt didn't work which led to Thomas H√§user becoming project manager. When the first game was in development, H√§user was newly employed by Blue Byte, and had done quality assurance work on it. In this capacity, he had made a list of possible gameplay improvements for the developers, who told him there was no time to implement his changes, as the game was almost ready for release. However, they had been impressed with his ideas, and, when the second game was greenlit, they suggested he apply his ideas to this game. This ultimately led to H√§user, a programmer by trade, working as the lead designer on the sequel. Amongst the graphical enhancements in The Settlers II are more on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, with four aesthetically distinct races. Gameplay improvements include a more strategic battle system, which allows players to send out scouts, and utilise a stationary offensive weapon in the catapult. Additionally, there is a story-driven single-player campaign, replacing the narratively-unconnected missions from the first game, which simply got harder as the player progressed, without any kind of connective plot. Initially, the team took the concept of a single-player storyline too far, designing maps which placed tight limits on what the player could and couldn't do, and featured time-sensitive scripted incidents. They quickly realised, however, that this went too much against the principles of the game mechanics established in the first game, and so changed the level design accordingly. According to H√§user, Despite the team's efforts to make The Settlers II as good as they possibly could, however, speaking in 2006, H√§user comments that, as with the original game, there were elements with which he was unhappy; \\"things like the help system. There was none, to be honest. The player had to work really hard to get into the game, and there's lots of details in the game you have to learn the hard way. It would have been a great help to a new gamer if we had some put in.\\" He also agreed with many fans of the game that the shipping system didn't work very well, even after it was patched in the Gold Edition; \\"it didn't work as we wanted it to work. I remember the ships did not transport the things you wanted to other islands, we couldn't solve this problem at the time. Because at this time, the development systems were much more difficult to use and we didn't have the ability to debug code as we do today. It was just not working as we wanted it to work.\\" When The Settlers III went into development in 1997, Blue Byte again sought feedback from fans, and one of the most requested aspects for the new game was that the shipping system from The Settlers II be reprogrammed. Mac OS version In August 1997, Blue Byte announced that they would be releasing the game for Mac OS later that year. H√§user explained, \\"we could not and would not ignore any longer the constant requests from Mac users. However, converting such a complex game as The Settlers II over to the Macintosh meant breaking new ground, not only for ourselves, but also for the industry. It was not easy to find programmers capable of not only replicating The Settlers high quality, but also meeting the reputed demands of Mac users.\\" Alexander B. Christof of Austrian conversion specialists, Similis, stated, \\"because the Mac has a completely different processor structure, the complex Settlers animation - with its thousands of animation phases - have had to be totally redesigned. The landscape routines which have been optimised for Intel processors have also had to be reconstructed.\\" However, in April 1998, Blue Byte CEO and producer of The Settlers II, Thomas Hertzler, announced that the company would not be releasing any further titles on Mac, citing poor sales and lack of support from Apple Inc.; \\"we have recently reviewed the situation and feel that due to the small number of sales for The Settlers II on Macintosh, it would not be beneficial for Blue Byte to continue developing and publishing titles for the Macintosh. As a huge Mac fan, I was disappointed that we didn't receive support from Apple when working on this title.\\" Nintendo DS version Screenshot of The Settlers on Nintendo DS, showing the use of the DS's dual screens, with the game's Activity Window on the top and the animated gameplay on the bottom. The Activity Window currently shows the HQ stats, whilst the bottom shows the game's graphics unchanged from its original MS-DOS incarnation. In July 2006, Ubisoft, who had acquired Blue Byte in February 2001, announced they would be releasing The Settlers II for Nintendo DS, the first time any game in the series had been released for a system other than a home computer. Whilst the press release referred to the game as The Settlers, the description of the port clarified that it was The Settlers II: Gold Edition, with references to \\"Roman or World Campaigns\\". However, although Ubisoft and Blue Byte were simultaneously working on a remake of The Settlers II for Microsoft Windows, The Settlers II (10th Anniversary), The Settlers for Nintendo DS would rather be a 1:1 re-release of the original Settlers II, with updated controls and a slightly modified interface. For example, the game would use one of the DS's screens for the various menu functions and Activity Windows, and the other would display the main action. Players would be able to swap which screen displayed what, whilst the game would be completely touch controlled, with the DS stylus substituting for the mouse on both views. Although the idea of doing a straight re-release of the game initially seemed like a straightforward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS. For example, to get the graphics to look identical to their 1996 incarnation, they had to be completely rewritten for the new device; behind the replication of the original's 2D isometric graphics, a 3D game engine is running, which must convert the graphics in real time. In March 2007, German gaming website Gameswelt published an interview with Blue Byte in which they discussed adapting the game to a handheld device. Speaking of the logistics of the port, they stated, Explaining why they had chosen the DS as the platform to which to port the game, they explained, They also pointed out that aside from the use of the stylus and the two screens, the gameplay and graphics were unaltered from the original. Reception The Settlers II received positive reviews, with an aggregate score of 84% on GameRankings, based on four reviews. The Nintendo DS re-release received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, with a score of 39 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on six reviews, and 38% on GameRankings, based on seven reviews. PC Games Petra Mauer√∂der scored the game 91%, giving it a \\"PC Games Award\\", naming it Game of the Month, and calling it \\"world class.\\" Her main criticisms concerned the notification system, which she felt wasn't entirely reliable when reporting on attacks, the \\"imposed arbitrariness\\" of where woodcutters work, and the absence of online multiplayer mode. However, she praised the graphics and gameplay, concluding, \\"this game will inspire you - regardless of whether you are among The Settlers veterans, or are usually rather sceptical about playing this particular genre.\\" PC Gamers James Flynn scored it 89%, and was especially impressed with the balance between city-building and combat. He particularly praised the economic system on which the game is built, calling it \\"so sound that everything you do makes perfect sense.\\" He also lauded the graphics and variety of animations. His main criticism was that he felt it was not overly different from the first title, writing \\"Blue Byte have not fundamentally altered the game in the same way that MicroProse did with Civilization II.\\" PC Players J√∂rg Langer scored it 4 out of 5, giving it a \\"Gold Player\\" award. Although he was critical of the \\"indirect control\\" over combat, and felt that \\"diplomacy has not been implemented in the slightest,\\" he praised the graphical improvements over the first game, the complexity of the economic system, and the story-driven single-player campaign, concluding \\"Settlers 2 is just as suitable for the patient casual player as for strategy experts - there is no more constructive, more relaxing strategy game.\\" Computer Gaming Worlds Tim Carter scored it 4 out of 5, praising the game's character and the complexity of the economic system, especially lauding the focus on economics over combat; \\"winning or losing is rooted in economics, and it will be hard to compensate for economic weakness with superior military tactics.\\" He concluded by calling the game \\"a fun and engrossing experience that challenges your brain without getting on your nerves.\\" Arcanes Andy Butcher rated it 8 out of 10, writing, \\"as well as adding new buildings and resources, Settlers 2 also has improved graphics and supports multi-player games. Big fans of the original will find more than enough new stuff to keep them occupied, while the simplicity of the game's controls enable newcomers to easily get to grips with it. Settlers 2 is a great strategy game that's deceptively addictive and absorbing.\\" GameSpots Trent Ward scored it 7.3 out of 10, writing, \\"there really isn't enough to do to make long-term world-building very satisfying.\\" Whilst he praised the graphics and the economic system, especially the complex relationship between the different buildings, he was critical of combat, concluding, \\"those who are looking for a more open-ended game may find that Settlers IIs low number of construction options and snore-inducing combat keep the game well within the bounds of strategy game mediocrity.\\" Stephen Poole scored the Gold Edition 6.6 out of 10. He too praised the economic system, but, like Ward, he was critical of combat. He also lamented the absence of online multiplayer, concluding, \\"the game is definitely not for everyone, but for those who think they're up to the challenge of lording over a sprawling empire, the Gold Edition is an excellent deal.\\" Sales and awards The game was a commercial success, considerably outselling the first Settlers title. In the German market alone, by November 1996, it had sold 150,000 units. By August 1997, it had sold over 500,000 units worldwide, and roughly 600,000 by May 1998. In August 1998, it was awarded the \\"Platinum Award\\" by the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland e.V. (VUD); an award given to titles costing DM55 or more, which sell over 200,000 units nationally within the first twelve months of their release. The game was nominated for Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1996 \\"Real-Time Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, losing to Command & Conquer: Red Alert. In 1997, PC Gamer (UK) ranked it at #27 on their \\"PC Gamer Top 100\\" list, calling it \\"an outstanding cerebral challenge.\\" Nintendo DS IGNs Jack Devries scored the DS version 4 out of 10, calling it \\"tedious, and [...] not even a functional game.\\" He was critical of the saving and loading times, which he argued were so bad as to discourage players from saving. He also criticised the touchscreen as unresponsive, the \\"frequent\\" crashes, and the pace of the gameplay. He concluded, \\"games like these usually get classified as \\"only for the hardcore fan,\\" but that's an insult to fans of The Settlers. The biggest fans of the game will be the ones that are most disappointed.\\" GameSpots Kevin VanOrd scored it 3.5 out of 10, calling it \\"a buggy mess.\\" He criticised the touchscreen as unresponsive, and the map and menu scrolling as \\"sluggish\\". He was also highly critical of the bugs, citing a mission which couldn't be completed until the sound effects were turned off, and another which crashes when the player zooms in or out. He concluded, \\"when it functions, The Settlers can be laid-back fun. But given that you never know how far you're going to get before the next crash, why bother?\\" Pocket Gamers Mark Walbank scored it 3 out of 10, citing \\"unforgivable technical issues.\\" He found the touchscreen unresponsive, the map scrolling \\"jerky,\\" and the menu icons too small. He also found the number of bugs \\"staggering\\", citing the disappearance of icons, intermittent inability to attack enemies, stored resources disappearing, and zooming directly after saving causing the game to crash. Although he praised the core gameplay, he concluded \\"The Settlers emerges as a real botched job, and one that desecrates the good name of the series.\\" Eurogamers Dan Whitehead scored it 1 out of 10, calling it \\"one of the most clumsy and broken games to [ever] receive a commercial release.\\" He criticised the touchscreen as unresponsive, the overly small icons, and the jerky map and menu scrolling. His biggest criticism concerned the bugs, concluding, \\"Settlers II is a great game. A classic. This version isn't. It's a travesty, and one that should never have been released. Without the fatal bugs it'd be a disappointing but passable conversion, but you can't play a game not knowing when, or if, the game will actually work the way it's supposed to.\\" Expansions=Mission CD The Settlers II Mission CD was released in Germany in December 1996. The expansion features nine new single-player campaign missions in which the player again controls the Romans, this time under the command of Octavius's great-grandchild, as he attempts to conquer the entire world. It also features twelve new maps for Free Game mode, now renamed \\"Limitless Play\\", and a map editor. Gold Edition Released in October 1997, The Settlers II: Gold Edition contains the original game plus the Mission CD. It also features minor graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks. Additionally, the single-player campaign from the original release has been renamed \\"Roman Campaign\\", and the Mission CD single-player campaign has been renamed \\"World Campaign\\". In 2009, the Gold Edition was released on GOG.com. Legacy The Settlers II has given rise to two free, open source games released under the GNU General Public License. Widelands, written in C++ and built on the SDL libraries, is an ongoing project begun in 2001. Inspired by and based upon The Settlers and, to a larger extent, The Settlers II, Widelands is itself a new game with its own storyline, races, buildings, graphics and gameplay. In a 2009 review of Build13 for Linux Journal, John Knight wrote, \\"Widelands is a breath of fresh air in an extremely stale genre, whose roots ironically stem from way back in the past in RTS history. Whether you're chasing a fix of that original Settlers feel or just want a different direction in RTS, this game is well worth a look. Return to Roots (originally Settlers 2.5), also written primarily in C++, is an attempt to recreate the original Settlers II, whilst introducing elements not found in the original game, such as online multiplayer, as well as allowing it run natively on operating systems later than Windows XP, as well as Linux and MacOS. Begun in 2005, Return to Roots still requires the original game files to work, but features higher resolution OpenGL-rendered graphics, reprogrammed sounds, new maps, new missions, and a new race (the Babylonians). Remake and re- release In 2006, an enhanced remake with a new storyline was released for Microsoft Windows under the title The Settlers II (10th Anniversary) (). Thomas H√§user, lead designer of the original Settlers II, chose to remake that particular game as it seemed to be the favourite of fans of the Settlers series. The biggest decision regarding the remake was to renovate the game rather than reinvent it; In November 2018, Ubisoft re-released the Gold Edition as both a standalone History Edition and as part of The Settlers: History Collection. Optimised for Windows 10, the re-release contains both the original game and Mission CD expansion, and features autosave, 4K monitor support, dual monitor support, options for mouse and keyboard inputs, key mapping for keyboard input, and different device support for split-screen. Available only on Uplay, the History Collection also includes re-releases of The Settlers, The Settlers III, The Settlers IV, The Settlers: Heritage of Kings, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, and The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom.

From 1998 to the present Hotel X has been mining the musical wealth of Africa and Latin America by using rhythms and melodies inspired by traditional music and contemporary composers from those regions. The 2003 self-produced/released seventh album by Hotel X titled Hymns for Children marks the departure from the group's earlier more electric, harmolodic adventures into the organic, world music-inspired band of today. In 1994 Hotel X contributed an original composition, \\"One Way Street\\" (released on the CD Ladders in 1995), to the trailer of the film Hands of Fate by Chris Quinn which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. Quinn's documentary film God Grew Tired of Us is the winner of both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.

It was designed by NSW Government Railways and built from 1883 to 1884 by John White, Chas. & Wm. Coghill & Thos. Proull. It is also known as Springwood Railway Station Group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 11 July 1867.Springwood Station NSWrail.net It previously had a passing loop to the east of Platform 1.  History  When the first railway line over the Blue Mountains was constructed in 1867 under the direction of John Whitton, a station at Springwood was opened. This location has been an important railway station for over 140 years, with several trains to and from Sydney starting and terminating here. The present brick main station building was constructed in 1884, at the same time as stations were built at Wentworth Falls and Lawson. In the 1880s, the Blue Mountains started to become a popular holiday destination and this was reflected in the provision of new, brick platform structures to replace the initial timber buildings. Springwood received in 1886 the finest building on the Blue Mountains, apart from Mount Victoria. It was also a rare example of local, official involvement in the building design, with the District Engineer, Fred Avery, approving the architectural details. A gate keepers cottage was located west of the station building (now privately owned) and is not part of this listing. Bathurst Road crossed the railway line on the western side of the station and the resident gatekeeper was responsible for manning the gates at the level crossing. A footbridge provided pedestrian access across the line. With only one line across the mountains at this stage, the station building faced north to the line and to the crossing loops that were then in place on the north side of the main line. The railway line over the Blue Mountains was duplicated in 1902 necessitating alterations to most of the platforms on that line. In most cases a new station was built, but in the case of Springwood Railway Station, a new platform wall was built on the south side of the main station building and alterations to the main station building were undertaken to provide a shelter on that side of the station. This was probably when the building was also extended one bay to the east. The level crossing was replaced by a subway and the residence to the west of the railway station was removed to make way for the footbridge which provided access from the north and south sides of the station to the platform. A men's toilet block was built to the east of the main station building. It is not clear whether the footbridge was a modification of the earlier footbridge or a new construction.The footbridge which existed prior to the 1902 modifications was not the original footbridge of 1879 A signal box was opened in 1935 within the building envelope. In 1995 the room in which the interlocking frame is situated was changed. From the 1940s onward, Springwood was an important watering station for steam locomotives proceeding to Sydney. Whilst taking on water there, however, it was extremely difficult for locomotives to be positioned in the necessarily precise location because of the falling gradient. Few changes were made to the station between 1902 and 1997. In 1998, station upgrading works were undertaken including the construction of a subway to provide pedestrian access from the north and south to the platform, replacing the 1902 footbridge, a lift between the subway and the main station building, and a new canopy over the west end of the platform to provide shelter to the subway and platform. Pedestrian access to the station is via a staircase, or elevator for the disabled, that connects to an underpass tunnel that connects to Macquarie Road to the south-east, and the station's multi- story parking structure to the north-west. The underpass is a relatively recent modification to the station, added in the late 1990s. Previously, station access was via an overpass bridge that likewise doubled as both access to the station and as a rail crossing. Platforms and services Springwood has one island platform with two sides. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow with 2 evening services to Bathurst. Some services from Sydney terminate at Springwood. One late night westbound service each day departs from platform 1, in order to perform a points cleaning move, which ensures both sets of points near the station are in working order.  Description  The complex includes a type 3 second-class station building, built in 1884; with a signal box, completed in 1935; and a brick lavatory building (male toilet), completed in 1944. Other structures include a face brick island platform, completed in 1884 and 1902; and a pedestrian subway, completed in 1997-8. Station building External: Constructed (1884) of face brick with corrugated steel roof which extends on both sides to form an awning over both platforms. The Springwood station building is an early second class single storey island building in the Victorian Carpenter Gothic style. The extension at the east end of the building, breaking the symmetry, has a hipped roof behind the parapet. Two chimneys on the ridgeline of the main roof are rendered with wide rendered and moulded corbels. The existing chimney pots are not original. The walls of the original building are Flemish bond tuckpointed brickwork with sandstone capping to the parapets and sandstone quoins to the external corners and reveals to openings. An arch on the centre of the original parapets has a stone infill carved with \\"ERECTED 1884\\". Sandstone finials top the gables and bull's-eye vents in the gables are edged with sandstone. The east extension of the building is in stretcher bond brickwork but is finished with sandstone detailing matching the original construction. The brickwork has been painted. The building has three panelled doors with fanlights and dentilated transoms. Doors to the centre of the building are similar but have two panels. Windows are double hung and finished with sandstone label moulds. The original wide awning on the north side of the building is supported on timber stop chamfered columns with capitals and pattern carved on the centre of the columns. Cast iron brackets provide further embellishment to the columns. Awnings on the south side of the building are typical of the 1902 railway stations in the Blue Mountains with a wide low pitched roof supported on steel brackets supported on stone corbels. The ends of both awnings are finished with a timber boarded valance. A train mural by artist Vernon Treweeke is located on the eastern side of the main station building covering the privacy wall to the male toilet. Other murals by the same artist are located at Katoomba and Woodford Railway Stations. Internal: The building appears to have maintained few of its original detailing and finishes due to the upgrade works of 1997/98. However, the original floor layout including a waiting room, ticket office, parcels office and signal box and ladies room are still present in addition to early double panelled timber framed windows and timber doors. Light fittings and carpet finish are relatively new. The 1902 extension to the southern side of the building is clearly apparent forming a corridor along the building. The 1935 signal box within the station building's envelope survives with its signage and no longer operates (lever frame and CTC panel removed). It is currently a storage room with exposed roof structure and painted brick walls. Lavatory building External: A simple gabled building (1944, 1998) on axis with the platform with a clearstory ventilated roof. The roof is of corrugated steel with exposed purlins to the gable ends and exposed rafters. The walls are Flemish bond tuckpointed brick work. Entry is at east end through an arched door behind a brick screen with the Mural on the outer side. Windows in the north wall have stone sills. Internal: All toilet and light fittings date to 1998 upgrade works with painted brick walls and fibrocement ceiling panels. Island platform Springwood Railway Station has an island platform (1902) in a curved shape towards the east. The platform is brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. A small square portion of grass has been inlayed into the platform surrounded by concrete west of the lavatories. A few potted plants are located on the north side of the platform under the station building awning, near the booking office and either side of the station level lift entrance. No garden beds are present. Entrance to the subway is located at the east end of the platform between the lift and station building. Period and modern light fittings and timber bench seating in addition to modern and early signage, aluminium palisade fencing between the station building and the lavatories and at both ends of the platform. Pedestrian subway The pedestrian subway (1997/1998) is marked by a long gabled corrugated roof on the Macquarie Road footpath and a low pitched gabled roof over the west end of the platform with cantilevered awnings connected to the awnings of the main station building. The walkway is most prominent from the western Macquarie Road approaches to the station than from the more eastern approaches. Access to the platform is via a ramped access way from both sides of the subway towards a central stairway on the west side of the subway and a lift at the east wall. The internal walls of the subway are tiled from floor to ceiling. The station is a prominent element in the Macquarie Road streetscape, overlooking a bend in the road making it a local landmark. Moveable items * A Milners' Patent safe (no number) has been observed at the station office. * Several original station signage depicting \\" Station Master\\", \\"Waiting Room\\", \\"Booking Office\\", \\"Parcels Office\\", \\"Signal Box\\" etc. * 2 x commemorative plaques (1984 & 1998) on Platform 1 elevation of the station building. * Early light fittings on platform Landscape features A brick 1902 retaining wall runs along the edge of the Macquarie Road footpath, elevating the railway line and platform from the street.  Condition  As at 10 September 2008, the station building was generally in good condition. Also in good condition were the lavatory building, the island platform and the pedestrian Subway. The station group has a high degree of integrity with minimal changes to the exterior of the buildings. The overall integrity of the station has been reduced due to the 1990s upgrade works, which obscure views to the roofscape of the building and impact on the setting.

The main station building is the second oldest surviving station building in the Blue Mountains and is an unusual example of a Victorian Gothic railway station building. It is one of three stations in the Blue Mountains upgraded in 1880s demonstrating increase of tourism activity (the others being Lawson and Wentworth Falls) and is the only station building surviving from this period. Modifications to the building resulting from the duplication of the railway line in 1902 retained the elegant Victorian Gothic character of the station. With the intact lavatory building it is an important element in the chain of railway stations across the Blue Mountains. The size of the main station building and its solid well detailed construction suggests the growing importance of the village of Springwood in the 1880s. Springwood Railway Station Group is important to the local townscape forming a landmark at the curve in Macquarie Road towards the western end of the shopping centre. Springwood railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

Springwood station building is a rare extant example of a railway station building in the Victorian Gothic style with upgrade works in the 1880s. Springwood station building is the only surviving building from this style as the other two station buildings from this era at Lawson and Wentworth Falls have been demolished. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The main 1880s station building is classified as a \\"type 3\\" second-class station building and is one of approximately 40 other similar station buildings across NSW and has representative significance for demonstrating widespread 19th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW.

It was founded by the People of Praise in 1981 with fewer than 30 students. Since then it has developed a strong educational presence that attracts students from all parts of northwest Indiana and southwest Michigan, as well as international students. Located at 107 South Greenlawn Avenue in South Bend, Indiana, it offers classical Christian education to students. It is accredited by the Independent School Association of the Central States (ISACS). The Greenlawn campus has two sister schools, Meadow View and River Ridge. The schools are independent and are owned and operated by Trinity Schools, Inc. Faculty John Lee is Head of School at the Greenlawn campus. Erica Price is the Dean of Academics. Matthew Bartek is Dean of Boys and Danielle Svonavec is the Dean of Girls. Mr. Jon Balsbaugh is the president of Trinity Schools, Inc. Trinity also employs other teachers. Classes Students at Trinity School at Greenlawn take a multitude of classes that have been lauded by the United States Department of Education, including a 6-year writing course and a 4-year Latin course. Athletics Trinity School at Greenlawn hosts athletic teams for its students. Their mascot is the Titans. The sports for girls are soccer and basketball. The sports for boys are soccer and basketball. Greenlawn has posted its best records in boys' basketball and girls' soccer. The school's home games are normally located at the Trinity School Athletic Center. Greenlawn has also hosted golf, fencing and boxing. Extracurricular activities Students of Trinity School at Greenlawn participate in a wide variety of sponsored extracurricular activities. Students engage in the Mock Trial program which averages 4‚Äì5 teams per year. Students take part in a number of other clubs and committees including: Chamber Choir, Women's Choir, Men's Choir, Art Club, Volunteer Club, Student Life Committee, the Trinity School Review, Computer Science Club, Math Club, and Yearbook, though there can be others. Most of the clubs vary from year to year depending on the interest of the students; this is partly due to the fact that most clubs are student-led. Facilities Trinity School at Greenlawn occupies part of a complex of buildings initially named Elm Court, site of the opulent mansion home of Clement Studebaker, Jr., and his family. Studebaker sold the property to Vincent Bendix, one of South Bend's most prestigious businessmen. Bendix never resided in the mansion, preferring to live in Chicago, but he renovated parts of the building to accommodate glamorous parties for air race pilots and Hollywood celebrities. In those days the property became known as Chateau Bendix. After Bendix declared bankruptcy, the mansion was unoccupied for a time. In the late 1940s the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis purchased the site for use as their motherhouse. The sisters preserved the original mansion, with renovations, and added a new three-story building adjacent to the mansion with a magnificent chapel, numerous classrooms and residence space for the order's members. When their ministries shifted geographically away from Indiana, the sisters relocated their motherhouse. The People of Praise community acquired the property in August, 1982, for dual use by Trinity School and by the community's international headquarters. At that point the school became known as Trinity School at Greenlawn, with reference to the address on Greenlawn Avenue. Though there is some overlap, People of Praise offices are situated in the original mansion, and Trinity School leases space in the parts of the building constructed by the sisters.

It is also known as Lawson Railway Station Group and Christmas Swamp; Blue Mountain. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 11 July 1867 as Blue Mountain, being renamed Lawson on 21 April 1879.Lawson Station NSWrail.net A passing loop exists north of Platform 1. As part of widening work to the Great Western Highway, a siding south of Platform 2 was removed and a new submerged siding constructed west of the station.  History  There was a halt at Lawson from the beginning of the railway through the mountains in 1867, bearing the name Blue Mountain initially after Wilson's \\"Blue Mountain Inn\\" 400 metres away. In 1879 when the station changed its name to Lawson, a brick platform and station building were added and this remained unchanged until 1902. Like most stations between Emu Plains and Lithgow, duplication of the line in 1902 brought a new island platform and station buildings in Federation style. The 1879 platform opposite remained for Down trains. Various modifications to the refuge siding and loop were made in 1907 and 1915. At the Lithgow end of the main structure, the roof was extended to provide a shelter for a signal interlocking frame, which was installed in 1915, though the signal levers were not enclosed with a signal box until 1921. In 1944 the island platform was extended to the west end and it was at this time that subway access was provided to the platform from the Sydney-bound side. This accorded with the traditional NSW practice between 1900 and 1920 of providing only single-side subway access. Lawson became an important station as locomotives took on water at that location. Lawson had a large water-tankLN 026 and an unusual number of water columns since it was the principal watering-halt for Down trains. Recent widening of the Great Western Highway has revealed the remains of what appears to be an underground tank of unknown use. The station was accompanied by a Station Masters residence which was built in , and replaced by the existing Station Master's residence in . When Chief Commissioner E.M.G. Eddy, was appointed in 1888, he undertook to increase substantially the number of official residences for staff of the Traffic Branch. Over 100 residences were built in his term and that at Lawson is one of them. Residences very roughly reflected the status of the proposed occupant. The example at Lawson (10 Loftus Street) is an example of the largest type that was used in the period 1890-1914. It contained three bedrooms. The asymmetrical plan of the structure predates Eddy's arrival and was first used in 1885. Adjacent to the Sydney-bound side of the rail corridor is an electrical traction sub-station and electrical depot containing a mixture of buildings originally clad in corrugated Fibro. The substation was built in 1956 in preparation for the complete electrification of the Main Western line from Penrith to Lithgow in 1957. This was the major extension of the metropolitan electrified system after World War II and the first designed to handle the electric haulage of rail freight trains, predominantly coal trains, as well as long distance electric passenger train services. The substation was the last of the large brick substations built for the rail electrified system and the largest on the Main Western line past Penrith. Modern solid state rectifier technology has now largely superseded the need for this type of substation building. It is associated and adjacent to the large Lawson electric line works maintenance depot that still operates with administration offices. The substation was designed by New South Wales Government Railways and built in 1956. It suffered some fire damage in 2003. Platforms and services Lawson has one island platform with two sides. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow.  Description  The complex comprises a type 11 brick station building, initial island side building, erected in 1902, incorporating a fibrocement clad signal box, completed in 1921; and a brick out shed, completed in 1902. Other structures included a brick-faced island platform, completed in 1902; a remnant timber paling facing side platform, completed in , and a pedestrian subway, completed in 1944. Other structures include the Station Master's Residence at 10 Loftus Street, type 11, brick, tile roof, erected in 1896; and electrical depot site with the former District Engineer's Office - brick (1956) and the workshops - brick base, corrugated iron walls (1957); as well as the signals and earthworks depot (1956-7); and a face brick substation (1956). Station building (1902) and Signal Box (1921) External: Constructed of face brick with corrugated metal gabled roof extending as an awning to both platforms, Lawson station building is a single storey early phase \\"type 11\\" island platform building in standard Federation style design. It is an 8-bay long building featuring 7 bays to the original face brick section and 1 long bay to the signal box extension and has a linear arrangement along the platform with tuckpointed red brickwork and engaged piers between the bays. The extended bay at the southwest end has painted fibrocement wall panels on rendered brick base with 6-pane horizontal sliding windows and a timber door with decorative fanlight. Other features include rendered splay course to plinth, moulded cornice, two horizontal moulded rendered string courses at corbel height, timber framed double-hung windows with multi-paned coloured glass upper sashes, timber framed and panelled doors with multi-paned coloured glass fanlights, contrasting decorative trims and sills around windows and doors, standard iron brackets over decorative corbels supporting ample platform awnings, fretted timber work at the end of awnings and gable ends, timber cross finial to gable end, two tall face brick corbelled chimneys with rendered tops. A modern corrugated metal gable roof with flat awning has been extended off the southwest end of the station building to provide shelter over the subway entrance and extended platform shelter area for commuters. It is supported by steel beams and posts. Another gabled roof with corrugated clear sheeting and corrugated metal awnings on both sides extends above the men's toilets entry. All windows and doors are fitted with metal security grills and gates. Internal: In 1994 the building underwent internal fabric alterations, however it maintains its original linear floor layout, which from Up end to Down end incorporates a former signal room, combined Station Master's office and booking office, general waiting room, ladies' waiting room and toilets, and men's toilets. Original features include timber panelled doors with multi-paned coloured glass fanlights in the ladies room and work station areas, moulded architraves to all external and internal doors and the ticket window. Light fittings, fans and floor covering including carpet finish in the offices and tiles in the toilets and the waiting room. Plasterboard ceilings are from the upgrade works. Doors have been clad with fire rated panels from inside. The former signal box within the station building is now used for storage purposes, however its interlocking 16 lever frame and the CTC panel are still extant. Out-of shed (1902) External: A small square shaped detached face brick shed featuring moulding and rendered string course detailing similar to the main station building. It is located on the northeast (Up) side of the station building. The shed features a gabled corrugated metal roof with timber bargeboard and narrow eaves with exposed rafters, contrasting rendered moulded trim above the fanlight over a single door on northeast side elevation and two double - hung windows with multi-paned upper sash featuring multi-coloured glass panes similar to the station building on both of the side elevations. There are two rows of string course throughout all elevations. There is no opening on the south-western (Down) elevation of the building. Internal: Currently used as a storeroom with a timber cupboard and shelving, the out-of shed consists of a concrete floor with painted brick walls, exposed timber roof structure with ceiling joists, rafters and relatively new corrugated metal roofing, and one single modern light fitting. Island platform (1902) Lawson Railway Station has an island platform in a curved shape with slightly pointed ends. The platform is brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. Garden beds are located along the length of the platform planted with low to medium height shrubs and plantings. One mature tree is present on the platform at the northeast end. The platform also features period and modern light fittings, timber bench seating, an early bubbler, modern signage and aluminium palisade fencing located around three sides of subway cavity for safety and at both ends of the platform. Side platform () The original side platform is no longer clearly visible as a former platform rather it presents a garden bed like appearance, with a raised flat surface with timber paling edgings and earth infill. The end of the down siding, which was only used occasionally until recently to store track machines when waiting to start or be collected after trackwork, has been partially removed and completely covered with aggregate as part of upgrading works along the road boundaries of the rail corridor. Only two posts of the end timber stopper remain. Pedestrian subway (1944) Access to the island platform is via an asphalt ramped access way from the Great Western Highway and Loftus Street (and commuters' car park) which leads to the face brick vaulted subway and a central stairway to the station platform on the southwest side of the main station building. The entry to the pedestrian subway on the island platform has brick walls with stone capping and metal palisade fence between the iron posts supporting the new corrugated metal gabled roof with awnings on both sides. The underpass tunnel extension towards the Great Western Highway exit features a flat ceiling with curved edges unlike the Loftus Street tunnel and painted with graffiti all-around. Light fittings and security cameras are other features of the subway. Station Master's residence (1896) External: The site of the residence is located between the Electric Depot and the Signals and Earthworks Depot. It is a single-storey cottage of painted brick construction with a stone base, a tiled-hipped roof with square flat apex, three tall chimney stacks with corbelled tops, timber front and rear off set concrete verandahs supported on timber posts with pitched corrugated iron awning and a rear brick skillion wing extended with timber weatherboard addition. The residence does not conform to any standard design although has similarities to a standard J3 design. Segmental arched vertically proportioned windows feature rendered sills, some with skillion timber awnings. All openings have been boarded up. Internal: The original floor layout remains containing three bedrooms, two open into a corridor and the other into the living room, and a separate sitting room off the corridor. A wing accessed via an enclosed verandah (and from one of the bedrooms by later opening) includes a kitchen with a later timber extension for a laundry and internal bathroom. Most of the original elements have either been replaced or removed including all fireplaces. Early features include timber framed double-hung windows with moulded timber architraves and skirting, ventilation panels in some rooms, timber panelled front door with fanlight and an early kitchen shelf above the boarded fireplace. The kitchen has been fitted with modern cupboards and the bathroom fittings are modern. Exposed rendered brick walls are present in the kitchen and timber floor ceiling boards are exposed in some of the rooms where the later fibro ceiling panels are damaged. The residence is currently unoccupied. Electrical depot site Located to the northwest of Lawson Station adjacent to the laneway and subway entrance, the Electrical Depot site is a combination of the former District Engineer's Office and a series of brick and corrugated iron workshops and stores that were built in the 1950s as part of the electrification of the railway to Lithgow. The buildings appear to be original and demonstrate an important component of the electrification project. The workshops and the stores are placed at the railway and street boundaries of the site while the L-shaped office block is located on the northern corner next to the entrance to the depot. The areas between the buildings are used for the storage of dangerous goods containers, ladder storage, truck waiting, steam cleaning and water treatment areas. The surface of the site is bitumen. Former district engineer's office (1956) External: A large one to two-storey brick office building with hipped terracotta tiled roof, in an L-shaped form and accommodates administration and amenities and facilities for the engineers and field/admin staff. The building's fenestration includes a series of regularly placed tall timber sash windows and doors generally facing the courtyard. Internal: Interiors were not inspected (2009). However, the original drawings indicate a linear floor layout with offices around the perimeters opening into a central corridor. The main entrance to the building separates the building into two distinct layout with offices and staff amenities on one side and the general exchange and depot/services rooms on the other. Workshops (1957) External: There are seven workshops and stores on the depot site all of which are generally of similar construction with utilitarian appearance in various sizes and one or two storeys in height. They are constructed of brick bases with corrugated metal walls to about 1200mm high above with corrugated metal gabled roofs. All have timber framed multi-paned vertically proportioned windows and doors. They accommodate an electrical workshop, blacksmith and carpenter workshop, and stores for various goods. Internal: Interiors were not inspected (2009). Signals and earthworks depots Two adjoining sites at the western side of the Station Master's residence and contain only demountable corrugated metal sheds and containers with carport and garages in between. They appear to be replaced over the years with relatively new fabric. Sub-station (1956) External: Located at the most western portion of the depot site, the substation is a two-storey face brick building in rectangular form with gabled roof covered with corrugated metal tray roof sheets. The substation combines a large relatively square shaped control house and a rectangular rectifier house at the back. The building elevations are strongly modelled with large vertical engaged piers. The gable end to the control house is parapeted with piers projecting horizontally. The rectifier house has a ventilation tower at the centre of the gable apex below which is a large roller shutter. All windows are steel framed with horizontal panes. The building is screened from the road by banks of outside transformers. Internal: Interiors were not accessed (2009). However, it is noted to have a steel truss exposed roof structure and concrete slab floors with painted wall finishes to the essentially large warehouse type spaces. Moveable items Lawson Railway Station houses a number of movable items including: *A Milners' 2'2 Patent floor safe in the ticket office below the ticket window desk *A bubbler on platform next to the subway entrance *Three bench seats (2 in the waiting room, 1 in the ladies room) *16 lever frame and CTC panel in the disused signal box *A work bench for booking window Landscape features The setting of the station within the rock escarpment is the typical natural setting of the Blue Mountains stations. The island platform and stations buildings are a prominent aspect of the landscape and a local landmark. Most garden beds are built up with treated pine edges containing low to medium-sized shrubs. One mature tree exists at the northeast end of the platform. Brick dwarf walls to the subway tunnel entries on both sides of the trucks together with the low height plantings add to the overall setting of the site. Potential archaeological features There are no known potential archaeological elements on the station site with the exception of a remnant side platform and siding on the Down side. The recent findings during the widening of the Great Western Highway indicate the potential existence of surviving remnants of the former Goods Yard along the Highway. The Electrical Depot Site containing the substation and other associated structures may also have archaeological potential.  Condition  *Station Buildings and platform structures - Good *Island Platform- Good *Side Platform - No longer presents as a platform but in its garden bedlike form is in good condition *Subway - generally Good condition *Station Master's residence - Moderate externally, Very Poor internally *Electrical Depot Site - Generally Good externally *Signals and Earthworks Depot - Good externally *Substation - Good The station building and associated shed are intact externally and maintain their overall integrity. The Station Master's residence has lost most of its internal and some of its external fabric. Its integrity is therefore moderate. The buildings within the Electrical depot have a high level of integrity and intactness externally. While most equipment originally installed has been removed from the Substation the building is relatively intact despite the fire damage in 2003.  Modifications and dates  *1970s: Mercury arc rectifiers in the substation replaced with solid state equipment *1994: Internal fabric of station building was altered. *2000: The collection of old electric metres were relocated to Strathfield Depot September. *2003: Substation damaged by fire. *N.d: Modern platform canopy has been added. Modern platform fence and station seats. Roof extended over the platform entry to the pedestrian underpass. Brick screen to lavatory at east end of main building. Fence to underpass entry from platform. Side platform has been significantly modified and Down siding removed (in part) and covered with aggregate recently. *N.d: The original roof of the Station Master's residence, with an ornate ridge, has been replaced at an unknown date; internally, virtually all original fabric has been removed.  Further information  Modern demountable buildings within the depot sites are excluded from the listing. A (1907) Monier Arch overbridge lies outside the curtilage and is located northeast of the island platform. It consists of a concrete arch with abutments set in rock cutting. The bridge was widened in 2009. Excluded from listing. Another 1907 Monier Arch bridge (used for pedestrian access) - 1 km east of station near Somers Street and GWH overbridge has separate S170 listing. Transport links Blue Mountains Transit operates one route via Lawson station: *690K: Springwood to Katoomba  Heritage listing  As at 9 November 2010, Lawson Railway Station Group is of state significance as an important railway location along the Main Western Line and is significant for its important historical role associated with locomotive servicing facilities and the change to electric traction power supply at this steepest part of the Blue Mountains. The place is unique and has research potential for its combination of buildings and structures that demonstrate a large railway complex of railway station, accommodation, service, depot and administration facilities. The station building demonstrates the period of line duplication across the Blue Mountains and is a good example of a standard 1902 Federation style design station building with matching detached shed. The Lawson Station Master's residence is significant for its ability in demonstrating the custom of providing accommodation for railway staff, and is a representative example of the simple architectural forms employed in other railway residences in NSW. The buildings of the Electrical Depot including the former District Engineer's office and the associated stores and sheds have historical and research significance to demonstrate the former administration and railway electrical supply facilities along this section of the Blue Mountains. The Lawson substation is the last major rail electric substation built for the Sydney metropolitan network and the largest such building on the Main Western line between Penrith and Lithgow. While the original function of the building has been superseded by modern technology, the substation represents one of the final phases in the development of the electrified railway system for the Sydney Metropolitan area. Lawson railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lawson Station Group is historically significant as part of the early station buildings built during the duplication of the Western rail line across the Blue Mountains combining a standard 1902 Federation style design station building and matching detached shed. It demonstrates the technological and engineering achievements in the early 1900s and is an important part of the townscape of the Lawson historic village and is highly visible from the main road. The site has further historical significance due to its continued rail use since 1880, with the Station Master's cottage demonstrating the custom of providing accommodation for railway staff and the importance of the station as a key terminus for locomotive facilities with its large number of water columns and tanks. The Electrical Depot site demonstrates another major phase in the historical development of Lawson Station precinct featuring buildings built in the 1950s as part of the electrification of the railway to Lithgow. The substation is the last major rail electric substation built for the Sydney metropolitan network and the largest such building on the Main Western line between Penrith and Lithgow. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lawson Station Group is of aesthetic significance as a representative example of an intact Federation free classical style railway station, which has retained its former lamp building (Out of Shed) which is designed in the same style as the main station building. It is one of a group of stations built to the same pattern across the Blue Mountains following the duplication of the railway line. The Station Master's residence has an unusual architectural style as it does not conform to any standard design although has similarities to a standard \\"J3\\" design. The buildings of the Electrical Depot including the former District Engineer's office and the associated stores and sheds collectively form a cohesive character within the landscape of the station precinct. The substation is a landmark in the precinct and rail corridor as well as the Great Western Highway. The depot buildings have limited aesthetic or architectural value due to there utilitarian design. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lawson Station Group has research potential for its combination of buildings and structures that would provide information on the elements of the equipment contemporary with the electrification of the Main Western line over the Blue Mountains. The Electrical Depot contains a number of technically important electrical engineering equipment such as the large rectifier. The area along the Great Western Highway has potential for surviving remnants of the former goods yard and the former Down side platform and siding. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Electrical Depot site is rare in the railway network, which includes the substation, one of a small number of such building and one of the largest remaining on the system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Lawson Station Group is a representative example of a standard design larger station building group demonstrating the construction techniques and characteristics of commonly used railway designs. The Station Master's residence is a representative example of simple architectural forms of other similar railway residences. The substation is a good example of rail substations built in Sydney after 1926 including Hurstville, Lewisham, Sutherland, Hornsby and Belmore.

The route extends north of Bristol as a secondary route into the town of Burlington. Route 69 is in total length. Route description Route 69 begins in the Amity neighborhood of New Haven as the continuation of Whalley Avenue, splitting off from Route 63, which continues along Amity Road. It soon crosses under the Wilbur Cross Parkway with an interchange at the Woodbridge town line. Past the Parkway, the road becomes known as Litchfield Turnpike and heads northward along the western side of West Rock. Route 69 then enters the town of Bethany, where the route leaves the Litchfield Turnpike to head along Carrington Road. Several miles later, Route 69 enters the town of Prospect with the road becoming known as New Haven Road. North of Prospect center, the road becomes Prospect Road as it heads towards the city of Waterbury. In Waterbury, the road continues along Hamilton Avenue, meeting with I-84, then turning right onto Silver Street, later becoming Meriden Road. Route 69 leaves Meriden Road following Woodtick Road and Stillson Road, then turns right onto Wolcott Street. Wolcott Street becomes Wolcott Road as Route 69 crosses from Waterbury into the town of Wolcott. Route 69 intersects with Route 322 in the town center then continues north towards the city of Bristol. In central Bristol, the route turns onto West Street, intersecting with Route 72 and U.S. Route 6. After a brief overlap with Route 6, Route 69 continues its northward journey along Burlington Avenue. After the junction with Route 6, the road becomes a secondary, minor arterial road as it heads into the town of Burlington. In Burlington, the road name changes to Milford Street and eventually ends at a junction with Route 4 near the town center of Burlington. History Parts of modern Route 69 belonged to two separate state highways in the 1920s. The road from Prospect to Waterbury was designated as State Highway 348, while the road from Waterbury to Bristol was known as State Highway 172. Route 69 was created in the 1932 state highway renumbering as a direct route from New Haven to Waterbury. It used the southernmost portion of the old Litchfield Turnpike (local name for the Straits Turnpike) from the Amity section of New Haven to Bethany, then former town roads from Bethany to Prospect (Carrington Road and New Haven Road), and then former State Highway 348 from Prospect to East Main Street (then Route 14) in Waterbury. The section from Waterbury to Bristol (former State Highway 172) was renumbered to Route 119 in 1932. In 1934, Route 69 was extended to Bristol (at Route 6), taking over former Route 119. In 1962, a further extension north to Burlington (at Route 4) using former unsigned SR 787 was made. At the same time, the route in Waterbury was shifted slightly east (from Wolcott Street to Woodtick Road) for better through traffic flow.

Licensed to Niagara Falls, New York, United States, the station serves the Niagara Falls area from studios in Kenmore. The station is currently owned by William Yuhnke, through licensee Kenmore Broadcasting Communications, Inc. History=As WJJL WJJL's logo during the ownership of M.J. Phillips (1990s to 2019). WEBR originally went on the air as WJJL (after its founding owner John J. Laux) in December 1947, and it serves Western New York and Southern Ontario, Canada. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Canadian native Thomas Talbot worked for Laux as a salesperson at the station. Eventually, Talbot became sales manager and then owner of WJJL, which was incorporated as the Niagara Frontier Broadcasting Corp. He also owned WBNY (now WMSX) in Buffalo. Talbot began one of the first radio ‚Äútwo-way‚Äù telephone talk shows in the United States in the early 1950s, which was called Party Line. There was an eight-second delay in order to avoid potential problem calls. The mid- morning show was renamed Viewpoint in the 1960s and continues to be hosted by longtime Niagara Falls fixture and former news director Tom Darro. Talbot died in 1976, and the station was taken over by his widow, Norma Talbot. An 18-year-old aspiring country musician named Ramblin' Lou Schriver was one of the station's first on-air personalities; he eventually earned fame in the Buffalo area and bought his own station, WXRL, in 1970.http://buffalo.com/2016/01/18/featured/138184/ In WJJL‚Äôs heyday, the station was locally-programmed for Niagara Falls with a full line-up of live, local personalities and a local news department, which covered Niagara Falls, New York and the surrounding Niagara County. The station aired a number of live ethic and specialty programs on weekends, including the Spanish language Ecos Borincanos program aimed at the Puerto Rican community - which enjoyed a 40-year run, the Italian Mattinata D‚ÄôOro and Pit Stop for auto-racing fans. Later, the Italian Casa Rico, the nation‚Äôs longest running ethic language program moved to WJJL, and it continues today on WEBR. WJJL was a launching pad for many future top talents. These include former News Director and Viewpoint host Dave McKinley, now an Emmy Award-winning reporter for WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. John Murphy, the current radio voice of the Buffalo Bills, worked there early in his career, as did long-time WMSX/Buffalo Morning Host Joe Chile, and national voice-over artist Jeff Laurence. Former WGN Radio-Chicago VP/General Manager Tom Langmyer worked there as a summer fill-in personality, news reporter and anchor while in college. Other noted WJJL alumni include George ‚ÄúHound Dog‚Äù Lorenz, Barry Lillis, Dorothy Shank, WBEN Buffalo talk show host Tom Bauerle, WBFO Buffalo Reporter Dave Debo, Tony Magoo, John Jarrett, Jon Park, David J. Miller, Bob O'Neil, WKBW-TV Buffalo Anchor Melanie Pritchard, WGR Buffalo‚Äôs Howard Simon, former WIVB-TV Buffalo personality Craig Nigrelli and Cumulus Media Networks, Red Eye Radio, Nationally Syndicated Talk Host and former WBEN Talk Host Gary McNamara. The Talbot family sold WJJL to M.J. Phillips, who owned the station from the 1990s until 2020 and operated it as an oldies music station. Unlike other oldies stations, WJJL maintained its focus on 1950s and early 1960s music throughout Phillips's ownership, resisting the format drift to classic hits that most other oldies stations experienced. In the 21st century, Phillips encountered financial problems (for a time he was listed as a debtor in possession of the WJJL license) and frequently tangled with a vexatious litigant named Joann who made repeated false filings with the FCC in a failed attempt to wrest control of the station from Phillips. After WJJL‚Äôs Niagara Falls offices and studios were destroyed in a fire in 1999, Phillips moved the station to West Seneca, a Buffalo suburb, which is 30 miles from Niagara Falls. In 2009, WJJL's morning show began broadcasting from a satellite studio in the Niagara Arts and Cultural Center in Niagara Falls. From 2000 to 2009, WJJL broadcast weekly games of the City of Buffalo Public School's Harvard Cup football league. The Harvard Cup championship was traditionally played on Thanksgiving. WJJL continued its weekly coverage of Western New York High School Football with a ‚ÄúGame of the Week,‚Äù focusing on the teams of the former Harvard Cup League.City broadcasts, sadly, will be silenced.

The WEBR call-letters were previously used in Buffalo from 1924 until 1993. Don Angelo, a longtime radio programmer and former part-owner of WBBZ-TV, began as general manager. The format change marks the return of adult standards to the Niagara Frontier for the first time since WECK dropped the format in 2017. WJJL's oldies format remains in the form of a three-hour block on Sunday afternoons. The station added a morning show hosted by Gail Ann Huber (most recently at WECK) and Bob Stilson (formerly at WBEN).

The Great Western Railway was intended to initially reach Bathurst but, beyond that town, its terminus was not stated. The Katoomba station opened in 1874 as \\"The Crushers\\". A sandstone quarry suitable for producing ballast for the construction and maintenance of the line was developed just to the north of the line, and from 1874 The Crushers was a stopping-place for trains with quarrymen, equipment and wagons for transporting ballast. A platform was provided in 1877 close to the level-crossing keeper's cottage (demolished in 1902). In 1881, a new timber platform and station were built, to the west of the level-crossing. The goods yard between the stations and Bathurst Road (then the Great Western Highway) was developed in 1883‚Äì4. This expansion was necessary because of Katoomba's growth in the 1880s and 1890s as a tourist and local commercial centre. The goods yard contains a valuable collection of traditional railway structures, including the 5 ton jib crane (no. T171), the goods shed 54' x 12' dating in part from 1881 and an unusual curved timber loading platform. There is also an office for the yard gatekeeper and for a signalman, all dating from the early 1900s. In 1891, the 1881 station building was moved to the improved goods yard to the south. The Katoomba Times reported on 10 October 1891 that \\"the old Katoomba station building is to be the goods shed, and was put into position last Wednesday (7 October 1891)\\", with the 1884 crane adjacent to the east. Around 1921 the goods yard was altered, the siding was realigned and the goods shed (the former station of 1881) was moved 18 metres to the east, where it still resides. The 1884 five-tonne crane was moved along with the shed to its present position. The present island platform and building at Katoomba date from 1891 and was constructed for ¬£6,922 (including the subway) by builders Quiggan and Kermode. They are unusual for two reasons. Firstly, the timber building is curved and, secondly, the building design was only used in the Sydney metropolitan rail system. It is the only such building constructed outside the Central-to -Parramatta line. It is one of four such structures remaining extant from a number of stations containing Type 10 buildings including Newtown, MacDonaldtown, Ashfield, Lewisham (all demolished - possibly other examples) and Summer Hill, Homebush and Croydon (extant). Extensions to the building in the same style were carried out in 1913 for ¬£216. Its dominant feature is the extension of the roof bearers to form awnings on both sides and the position of small ornate brackets under the awning beams, marking a transition from the use of posted verandas to cantilevered awnings. The platform was reached by the use of a pedestrian subway constructed in 1891, which were rare outside Sydney. The other main platform building is the elevated, timber signal box, which was commissioned in 1903. The signal box contains a cam and tappet 40 lever interlocking machine that was installed in 1945. It is typical of the construction time and is similar to boxes at Mount Victoria, Newnes Junction, Lithgow Yard and Exeter. The line was duplicated in 1902. A two-room timber building was built on the western end of the platform in 1909 for an inspector and an electrician and this building was extended in 1945 for use as a staff meal room. An \\"out-of\\" shed completed the platform structures. At the entrance to the Station are the \\"Progress Buildings\\" which are shown on a plan as part of a new \\"Booking and Parcels Office Building\\" dated 20 December 1938. The buildings are a single storey group of three shops facing south to Bathurst Road with an additional shopfront facing east to the exit from the railway station subway. The easternmost shop, 283-285 Bathurst Road, retains its original brass shopfront, albeit with some modification, and tiled piers between, the shop entries are recessed from the street with splayed shopfront reveals. The tiled and marble threshold records the name \\"MARX\\" an early Katoomba businessman who used the premises. The Progress Buildings are still owned by Transport Asset Holding Entity and leased for private business. The railway residence at 8 Abbotsford Road was sold in 1964.  Description = Station building (1891)  External: The station building is a unique type 10 \\"Standard Eddy\\" design, with its curved form along the platform. The building is a single storey building of rusticated weatherboards with a hipped corrugated steel roof largely hidden behind the encircling cantilevered awning with a deep valance of fretwork timber boards. This building type is one of the first major buildings to have a cantilevered awning. The building and awning are constructed on a curve following the platform shape. Cast iron decorative brackets on timber moulded posts support the awning along both of the platforms. Fenestration includes timber double-hung windows with multi- paned upper sashes (coloured glazing), frosted glazing to bottom sashes, and timber panelled doors with multi-paned fanlights (coloured glazing). The building retains its original/early external configuration and fenestration. Internal: The interiors of the station building generally retain the original layout combining (from west to east) a waiting room, booking office, staff room, clock room, station managers office, ladies toilet and gentlemen's toilets. The overall finishes include timber board wall and ceiling linings, moulded timber cornices and dado line, ceiling roses, fluorescent lighting, a fireplace in the SM's office with cast iron grate timber surrounds and tile hearth, and tile, linoleum or carpet floor finishes. Toilet fittings are modern.  Signal box (1902)  External: The signal box is a small timber structure on brick base with corrugated iron gabled roof and curved corrugated iron awning to all sides. It is long x wide located on the country end of the platform. The operating floor is above the platform level with L-shape stair access from the eastern side. Tall multi-paned ribbon windows all around the building provide a visual connection with the other platform structures. A small gabled timber panelled relay room with brick base and concrete steps is located just off the west elevation of the signal box. Internal: The internal finishes of the signal box are similar to the main station building with timber board ceiling and wall linings and timber skirtings. A 40 lever type A PL interlocking machine with associated signalling equipment is the major element in the space and is still in operation. Access to the relay room is prohibited.  \\"Out of\\" shed ()  External: A small rusticated weatherboard out-of-shed with gabled corrugated metal roof is located to the west of the signal box. It is used for flammable liquid storage and has only a timber board door with fanlight and a band window on the opposite elevation. Simple timber bargeboards and finials complete the gable ends. Internal: Timber framed structure with no internal wall and ceiling lining exposing the underside of the corrugated metal roofing and rusticated weatherboard. The floor is concrete.  Former inspector/electrician's office (1909 & 1945)  From 2009, this was used as a CCTV and meals room. External: Combining the 1909 two-room former inspector/electrician's office structure and the 1945 staff meal room extension, the shed is the most western structure on the platform. It is of a rectangular rusticated weatherboard building with corrugated metal gabled roof. Skillion corrugated metal awnings with timber brackets above a window and main door. Vertically proportioned sash windows are placed equally on the long sides while the shorter sides have a window and a door opening with awning. Security grilles installed to the windows. Internal: Internal features and finishes of the Shed are contemporary consisting of plaster board walls and ceilings with simple cornices. The kitchen of the staff meal room has a wall with rusticated weatherboard.  Island platform (1891)  Katoomba Railway Station has a curved island platform running approximately east‚Äìwest. It is brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. A number of garden beds and hanging pot plants together with remnant railway equipment/tools scattered between the buildings further enhance this unique curved station's setting. Modern lighting, timber bench seating, and signage are the other typical features of the platform. A new glass canopy is attached to the subway canopy at the eastern end.  Subway and awning (1891 & 1920)  The subway was constructed in 1891 with the awning added in 1920. The subway is constructed of face brick and displays unusual and well detailed construction with a curved flight of stairs leading from Bathurst Road. The scale of the subway is consistent with the importance accorded to Katoomba in the early 1890s. An exposed gabled roof in clearstory form with original/early iron truss roof structure and new corrugated metal roofing covers the ramp to the platform. Notable murals are located on both walls of the subway tunnel.  Signals branch office (1910) and yard office (1881/1891)  These two structures located adjacent to each other at the entrance to the yard form part of a relatively intact yard group. They are still used for railway purposes. They also have a close relationship to the railway station buildings. The structures are of a small scale with detailing consistent with the platform buildings. Signals Branch Office: The signals branch office is a single storey weatherboard building to the northwest of the Progress Building. It is a simple rusticated weatherboard shed with a gabled roof and a vaulted roof vent running along the ridge of the roof. The original windows are small multi- pane double-hung sashes. A large double hung window and a door opening with a skillion roof on timber brackets has been added on the west wall. Internally it appears to have been recently reclad with plasterboard panels and painted. It is not in regular use at this time (2009). Yard office: The yard office is also a weatherboard building with a simple gabled roof immediately south of the signals branch building. It is elevated on brick piers with no mortar and steel posts where the brick pier is missing. Two small four-pane casement windows are located on the side elevations while an unused door is located on the Station side of the shed. The shed appears to have been accessed from the Signals Branch Office (access was locked). An elevated ventilation roof at the ridge level with louvered sides and a skillion roofed timber lean-to the rear are other features of the Yard office.  Progress Building (1938)  The Progress Building is a single storey group of three shops facing south to Bathurst Road with an additional shopfront facing east to the exit from the railway station subway. The building has a rendered parapet wall to the street with curved elements and a simple cornice. Panels in the parapet wall indicate the names of the shops. The easternmost shop, 283-285 Bathurst Road, retains its original brass shopfront, albeit with some modification, and tiled piers between, the shop entries are recessed from the street with splayed shopfront reveals. The tiled and marble threshold records the name \\"MARX\\" an early Katoomba businessman who used the premises. The building has a skillion roof behind the parapet. The rear walls are of fibro with a weatherboard spandrel and have paired 2 pane casements windows with fanlights.  Goods shed (1881, altered 1884, moved 1891)  External: The goods shed is a standard building with significant alterations. The original structure was built around 1881 as the original station building with extension in 1891. The additions illustrate the increased freight handling of the yard. The goods shed is a simple gabled timber building on an east‚Äìwest axis sited close to the south side of the yard. It is clad in weatherboard and elevated on brick piers and dwarf walls with timber floor. There is evidence of window openings being changed. A number of timber framed four-pane sash windows in various sizes are placed to the end of the front elevation and the side elevations. Two timber boarded double loading doors with timber docks and a timber panelled office door in the centre with timber ladder are also located on the front elevation. Internal: Access to the interiors was not available (2009).  Timber platforms (1881)  A timber loading platform supported on brick piers and timber beams with a rail siding is attached to the western side of the Goods Shed. A timber corrugated metal awning widened by steel truss awning covers the entire platform. Another timber loading platform on timber posts is also attached to the eastern side of the Goods Shed just to the west of the Crane.  Crane (1884, moved 1891)  The crane is a Class 1, standard 5 tonne jib hand crane, No. T171, fixed on a stone base adjacent to the western timber platform. The stone base was not widely used. It is still in use irregularly and in fair condition.  Yard and gates (1883-4)  The material and form of the original 1891 gates appear to have been removed and replaced with wire mesh and pipe gates at an unknown date. The yard is no longer used for regular loading and goods yard purposes. A sandstone retaining wall raises the railway boundary of the site, behind the goods shed, extending the Yeaman Bridge at the west. Another sandstone retaining wall raises along the railway site above Goldsmith Place on the northern side.  Eastern store shed (modern)  Located to east of platform is a large shed building, painted with a mural and corrugated iron roof. It does not form part of the heritage listing.  Moveable items  The following moveable items have been observed: * 2 x Seth Thomas clocks: in the Booking office and the Signal Box * A number of railway equipment, machinery and tools are scattered within the site including Simmos Siding display. * 40 lever interlocking machine and signalling tools in the Signal Box * First generation railway steel container at the station site * Road tanker TBX from Hamilton Depot at the station site * An early timber station naming sign attached to timber posts is located on the north side of the store.  Landscape features  A number of platform garden beds with shrubs and small trees and hanging pot plants exist along the platform. The Signal Box is adorned with hanging plants, memorabilia and stone edged planter beds, which form part of the significance of the station precinct.Longworth, 2012, 7 The most significant landscape elements of the station are the brick walls around the station with sandstone retaining walls between the Progress Building and the Goods Yard. A mural by Vernon Treweeke below the Great Western Highway overbridge and the murals in the subway tunnel enhance the setting of the station group.  Potential for Archaeology  The goods yard has archaeological potential in providing evidence of the first station buildings and structures as well as the operational elements of the yard.  Modifications and dates  The following modifications were undertaken over the years: * 10 Sep 1898 Platform extended. * 21 Aug 1901 Platform extended at the eastern end. * 1 Nov 1907 Platform extended at the western end. * 7 Jul 1917 Up Refuge siding extended. * 10 May 1920 Awning erected between station building and steps. * 4 Aug 1923 Additions made to station building and booking office and electric light fitted to the station. * 15 Sep 1925 Up Refuge siding extended. * 1964 Residence at 8 Abbotsford Rd sold * 9 Jul 1977 Transfer of \\"F\\" level crossing lights to signal box which was in the gate cabin WN27, and installation of closed-circuit television to view the level crossing. * 1981 Gate house at 109.817 km demolished * Unknwown date: Level crossing closed, replaced by an overbridge further west. * Unknown date: Entrance to station considerably altered. Numerous changes to other buildings on the platform and in the goods yard.  Heritage listing  As at 23 September 2010, Katoomba Railway Station and Yard is of state significance as a unique railway site in NSW developed around a former ballast quarry and is significant for demonstrating Katoomba's growth in the 1880s and 1890s as the first tourist and local commercial centre in the Blue Mountains, before the duplication of the Western line in 1902. The 1891 station building is significant as one of few surviving timber railway station buildings known as \\" Standard Eddy\\", designed under Commissioner Eddy, and demonstrating the introduction of island platform buildings in NSW. Katoomba station building is the only known example of this station type outside the inner city area and is unique to the other examples for its curved form along the platform. The adjacent signal box with its garden beds and planting is also an important and integral element within the station group and is a rare example of a timber on-platform signal box. The site of the goods yard is of particular significance as it was part of the original Katoomba station precinct dating from 1878, which was used for locomotive turning and minor servicing and stabling of trains. While fulfilling a minor railway use at present for per way maintenance, it contains two relatively rare items, which are the former 1881 timber station building as its goods shed and the 1891 crane. The station group comprises a homogenous collection of timber structures adding significance to the townscape and streetscape with direct relationships to both. Situated at the focal point of Katoomba, the station is connected visually and physically to the town's commercial heart by the pedestrian subway and landscaped surrounds. The adjacent Progress Buildings from part of the station group and contribute to the early 20th Century character of the commercial precinct of Katoomba with their largely intact shopfronts. Katoomba railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The station has historical association with Commissioner Eddy due to his involvement in the design of the 1891 station building known as \\"The Standard Eddy\\" design. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Katoomba Railway Station is of aesthetic significance as one of few surviving timber railway station buildings known as \\"The Standard Eddy\\" (as it was designed under Commissioner Eddy) outside of the Sydney metropolitan area including Newtown, MacDonaldtown, Ashfield, Lewisham (all demolished) and Summer Hill, Homebush and Croydon (extant). Katoomba station building features an unusual deep timber valance to the awnings and it is unique to the other examples for its curved form along the platform. The tunnel connection with its gabled roof and associated glazing makes a pleasant sheltered walkway connecting the station to the town's commercial heart. The sandstone retaining walls to the north and south of the site are well built solutions to the perpetual problems of dealing with the Katoomba's topography and contribute to the character of the townscape. The Progress Building contributes to the character of the commercial precinct of Katoomba with their intact shopfronts and simple weatherboards and fibro character to the rear. The signal box is also an important and integral element within the station-scape of Katoomba. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Katoomba Station and Yard Group is of research significance for its demonstrative ability in providing evidence of construction techniques and form of a station and yard in the 1880s and 1890s before the Western railway line duplication. The goods yard has archaeological potential in providing evidence of the first station buildings and structures as well as the operational elements of the yard. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Katoomba Station and Yard Group is representative of Victorian era station development combining unique station buildings and yard demonstrating the close relationship between the yard and station as well as reflecting the direct relationship between the station layout and the growth of the local area.

Around 1930, he founded the Khaksar Movement, aiming to advance the condition of the masses irrespective of any faith, sect, or religion.S. Shabbir Hussain, Al-Mashriqi: The Disowned Genius, Lahore, Jang Publishers, 1991 Early years=Background Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi was born on 25 August 1888 to a Rajput family in Amritsar.Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947, page 3. Mashriqi's father Khan Ata Muhammad Khan was an educated man of wealth who owned a bi-weekly publication, Vakil, in Amritsar. His forefathers had held high government positions during the Mughal Empire and Sikh Empires. Because of his father's position he came into contact with a range of well-known luminaries including JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, and Shibli Nomani as a young man. Education Mashriqi was educated initially at home before attending schools in Amritsar.Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947, page 43. From an early age, he showed a passion for mathematics. After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree with First Class honours at Forman Christian College in Lahore, he completed his master's degree in Mathematics from the University of the Punjab, taking a First Class for the first time in the history of the University.Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947, page 45. In 1907 he moved to England, where he matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, to read for the mathematics tripos. He was awarded a college foundation scholarship in May 1908.The Times, 23 June 1908, page 12. In June 1909 he was awarded first class honours in Mathematics Part I, being placed joint 27th out of 31 on the list of wranglers.The Times, 16 June 1909, page 9. For the next two years, he read for the oriental languages tripos in parallel to the natural sciences tripos, gaining first class honours in the former, and third class in the latter.The Times,17 June 1911, page 6.M. Aslam Malik,Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi, page 3. After three years' residence at Cambridge he had qualified for a Bachelor of Arts degree, which he took in 1910. In 1912 he completed a fourth tripos in mechanical sciences, and was placed in the second class. At the time he was believed to be the first man of any nationality to achieve honours in four different Triposes, and was lauded in national newspapers across the UK.Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947, page 46. The next year, Mashriqi was conferred with a DPhil in mathematics receiving a gold medal at his doctoral graduation ceremony.The Times, 13 June 1912, page 7 He left Cambridge and returned to India in December 1912.M. Aslam Malik,Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi, page 4. During his stay in Cambridge his religious and scientific conviction was inspired by the works and concepts of Professor Sir James Jeans.S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980 Early career On his return to India, Mashriqi was offered the premiership of Alwar, a princely state, by the Maharaja. He declined owing to his interest in education. At the age of 25, and only a few months after arriving in India, he was appointed vice principal of Islamia College, Peshawar, by Chief Commissioner Sir George Roos-Keppel and was made principal of the same college two years later. In October 1917 he was appointed under secretary to the Government of India in the Education Department in succession to Sir George Anderson.Hira Lal Seth, The Khaksar Movement Under Search Light And the Life Story of Its Leader Allama Mashriqi (Hero Publications, 1946), p 16 He became headmaster of the High School, Peshawar on 21 October 1919. In 1920, the British government offered Mashriqi the ambassadorship of Afghanistan, and a year later he was offered a knighthood. However, he however refused both awards.Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947, page 30. In 1930, he was passed over for a promotion in the government service, following which he went on medical leave. In 1932 he resigned, taking his pension, and settled down in Ichhra, Lahore.Shan Muhammed, Khaksar Movement in India, Pub. Meenakshi Prakashan, Meerut, 1973 Nobel nomination In 1924, at the age of 36, Mashriqi completed the first volume of his book, Tazkirah. It is a commentary on the Qur'an in the light of science. It was nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1925, subject to the condition it was translated into one of the European languages. However, Mashriqi declined the suggestion of translation. Political life=Mashriqi's philosophy A theistic evolutionist who accepted some of Darwin's ideas while criticizing others,Dr Sarfraz Hussain Ansari, \\"The Modern Decalogue: Mashriqi‚Äôs Concept of a Dynamic Community\\", ISSRA Papers 2013, pp. 10-11 he declared that the science of religions was essentially the science of collective evolution of mankind; all prophets came to unite mankind, not to disrupt it; the basic law of all faiths is the law of unification and consolidation of the entire humanity. According to Markus Daeschel, the philosophical ruminations of Mashriqi offer an opportunity to re-evaluate the meaning of colonial modernity and notion of post-colonial nation-building in modern times.Markus Daeschel, Scientism and its discontents: The Indo-Muslim \\"Fascism\\" of Inayatullah Khan Al-Mashriqi, Modern Intellectual History, 3: pp. 443‚Äì472, Cambridge University Press. 2006, Retrieved 22 January 2018 Mashriqi is often portrayed as a controversial figure, a religious activist, a revolutionary, and an anarchist; while at the same time he is described as a visionary, a reformer, a leader, and a scientist-philosopher who was born ahead of his time. After Mashriqi resigned from government service, he laid the foundation of the Khaksar Tehrik (also known as Khaksar Movement) around 1930.Khaksar Tehrik Ki Jiddo Juhad Volume 1. Author Khaksar Sher Zaman Al- Islah (Khaksar Tehrik weekly) Mashriqi and his Khaskar Tehrik opposed the partition of India. He stated that the \\"last remedy under the present circumstances is that one and all rise against this conspiracy as one man. Let there be a common Hindu-Muslim Revolution. ... it is time that we should sacrifice‚Ä¶in order to uphold Truth, Honour and Justice. Mashriqi opposed the partition of India because he felt that if Muslims and Hindus had largely lived peacefully together in India for centuries, they could also do so in a free and united India. Mashriqi saw the two-nation theory as a plot of the British to maintain control of the region more easily, if India was divided into two countries that were pitted against one another. He reasoned that a division of India along religious lines would breed fundamentalism and extremism on both sides of the border. Mashriqi thought that \\"Muslim majority areas were already under Muslim rule, so if any Muslims wanted to move to these areas, they were free to do so without having to divide the country.\\" To him, separatist leaders \\"were power hungry and misleading Muslims in order to bolster their own power by serving the British agenda.\\" Imprisonments and allegations On 20 July 1943, an assassination attempt was made on Muhammad Ali Jinnah by Rafiq Sabir who was assumed to be a Khaksar worker.Jinnah of Pakistan, Calendar of events, 1943 The attack was deplored by Mashriqi, who denied any involvement. Later, Justice Blagden of the Bombay High Court in his ruling on 4 November 1943 dismissed any association between the attack and the Khaksars.Akbar A. Peerbhoy, Jinnah Faces An Assassin, Bombay: Thacker & Co., 1943 In Pakistan, Mashriqi was imprisoned at least four times: in 1958 for alleged complicity in the murder of republican leader Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (popularly known as Dr. Khan Sahib); and, in 1962 for suspicion of attempting to overthrow President Ayub's government. However, none of the charges were proven, and he was acquitted in each case. In 1957, Mashriqi allegedly led 300,000 of his followers to the borders of Kashmir, intending, it is said, to launch a fight for its liberation. However, the Pakistan government persuaded the group to withdraw and the organisation was later disbanded.Obituary, The Times, 29 August 1963 Death Mashriqi died at the Mayo Hospital in Lahore on 27 August 1963 following a short battle with cancer.The Pakistan Times, Lahore Reports, \\"Allama Mashriqi laid to rest\\", August 29 (PT 1963, Aug. 30) His funeral prayers were held at the Badshahi Mosque and he was buried in Ichhra.

It was designed by NSW Government Railways and built from 1902 to 1922. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 21 January 1880 as Browns Siding Pulpit Hill, and was renamed Medlow on 1 March 1883 and Medlow Bath on 1 October 1903.Medlow Bath Station NSWrail.net  History  The single track main line from Katoomba to Blackheath was opened in 1868. A halt stop was established at Medlow Bath in 1881. Its initial name was Brown Siding, because of Brown's pioneering sawmill close by in Railway Parade. The station became Medlow in 1883 and Medlow Bath in 1903 with the opening of Mark Foy's Hydro. The 1881 platform was 30 metres (100 feet) long and was situated on the down side of the single line where the present station is located. Additions to the station buildings were made in 1899, but duplication of the line in 1902 prompted the replacement of the original platform by the present island platform. The existing buildings date from that time and like most stations between Emu Plains and Lithgow, Medlow Bath received a standard Federation style brick building. Also on the platform is a small timber signal box. An open interlocking frame was erected on the platform in 1909 but evidence suggests that the frame was not covered by the existing structure until . It was taken out of service in 1957 but continued to be used as a store. It is now a rare example of a separate platform level signal box. An additional siding was built in 1926 and in 1942 the platform was extended at the Sydney end. The gatekeepers cottage is now privately owned. Platforms and services Medlow Bath has one island platform with two sides. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow.Medlow Bath Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage  Description  The complex comprises a type 11, island station building \\"A8\\" design, brick, completed in 1902; and a gabled roof, timber signal room, completed in . Other structures include a brick faced island platform, completed in 1902; and a footbridge, completed in 1901 and 1994. Station building (1902) Constructed of face brick with corrugated metal gabled roof extending as an awning to both platforms, the Medlow Bath station building is an early phase island building in standard \\"A8\\" Federation style design. It features 6 bays with linear arrangement along the platform with tuckpointed red brickwork with engaged piers between the bays. Other features include rendered and moulded two rows of string courses, moulded cornice, timber framed windows and doors with contrasting decorative trims and sills, standard iron brackets over decorative corbels supporting ample platform awnings, fretted timber work to both ends of awnings and gable ends, timber finials to gable apex, tall corbelled chimneys, timber framed double-hung windows with multi-paned and coloured upper sashes, and timber door openings with multi-paned fanlights with coloured glazing. Medlow Bath Station is an unattended station and its interiors are in an abandoned state. The floor layout of the building comprises a booking office, waiting room, ladies waiting and toilets and male toilets with access from the south end of the building. The interiors generally feature custom orb ceilings with ceiling roses, fireplaces with no grates, timber floor boards to main rooms and tiling to toilets, beaded dado line and timber bead style moulded cornices. Toilet fittings are modern. Signal room () A small timber building at the booking office end of the station on axis with the platform. Historical evidence suggest that this weatherboard building covered an interlocking frame, which was originally erected as an open frame. It appears to be used as a store room after being taken out of service in 1957. It has a steep gabled corrugated metal roof, rusticated timber boarding with small four-paned windows on three elevations, and a four-panelled timber door with timber awning on the south elevation. Island platform (1902) A typical island platform running north-south, with the buildings located approximately at the centre. The platform is brick faced with a concrete deck and asphalt finish. Two raised round shaped slabs are located to the south of the station building probably for access to the services below the platform. A number of garden beds along the axis of the platform enhance the setting of the station. Modern platform furniture including light fittings, signage, timber bench seating and aluminium palisade fencing at both ends of the platform are other features along the platform. Footbridge (1901, 1994) A standard concrete slab structure supported on original brick abutments and two steel trestles with new stairs to the platform and bridge with new concrete deck over the tracks spanning between the Great Western Highway and Railway Parade. The footbridge marks the northern end of the station. A concrete level crossing with relatively new fabric is also located on the southern end of the station. 1994 metal balustrades provides safety along the edges of the stairs and the bridge. Moveable items Two timber bench style seats in the waiting room.  Condition  As at 3 December 2008, the condition was assessed as follows: *Station Building - Good externally, however; internally it is in poor condition. *Signal Room - Good externally, internal condition unknown *Island Platform - Very Good *Footbridge - Very Good The station building has a high degree of integrity externally, however; the interiors have lost their intactness due to the poor condition. The timber signal room is intact. The footbridge is relatively intact as it retains its original steel superstructure.  Modifications and dates  * - 1909 interlocking frame covered by timber Signal box *1926 - additional siding built *1942 - platform extended at the Sydney end *1957 - line electrified *1994 - footbridge upgraded with new deck, stepway, and the superstructure cleaned and repainted. Transport links Blue Mountains Transit operates two route via Medlow Bath station: *698: Katoomba to *698V: Katoomba to Mount Victoria  Heritage listing  As at 15 April 2013, Medlow Bath Railway Station is significant as part of the early construction phase of railway line duplication on the upper Blue Mountains demonstrating the technological and engineering achievements in railway construction at the beginning of the 1900s. Constructed in anticipation of a boom period in the mountains particularly in connection with large holiday resorts such as the Hydro-Majestic Hotel, Medlow Bath station building is a good example of a Federation free classical railway station. The station building demonstrates typical architectural elements of the standard Federation style island platform buildings that were built between Penrith and Lithgow when the line was duplicated. Medlow Bath railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Medlow Bath Station Group is of historical significance as part of the early construction phase of railway line duplication on the upper Blue Mountains demonstrating the technological and engineering achievements in railway construction at the beginning of the 1900s.

Medlow Bath station building is a good example of a standard design island platform building and demonstrates typical architectural elements of Federation period standard buildings that were built between Penrith and Lithgow following the duplication of the railway line. It maintains its overall architectural quality and setting. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The timber signal room is a rare example of a separate platform level signal box as the majority of the signal rooms along Blue Mountains Line are incorporated into the main station building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The station building is one of the early examples of a large number of standard railway designs that were commonly used in the 1910s-20s after a decade from the construction of Medlow Bath station building.

It was designed and built by NSW Government Railways and built from 1897 to 1985. It is also known as the Blackheath Railway Station Group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 28 December 1869.Blackheath Station NSWrail.net  History  The contract for extending the railway from Lawson to Blackheath was awarded in 1863 to W. Watkins, who completed the track a year ahead of schedule in 1866, although the ballasting of the line by a separate contractor took longer. Blackheath was to be the temporary terminus because of its level site and good water supply, but before the station was finished the destruction of the road bridge over the Nepean River at Emu Plains in the flood of 1867 prompted John Whitton, in charge of railways, to open the line as far as Wentworth Falls to assist stranded travellers to the west. Wentworth Falls, therefore, was for a short time the terminus. In the meantime, Watkins had won the contract to extend the line from Blackheath to Mount Victoria and the completion of this stretch in May 1868 led to Wentworth Falls being replaced by Mount Victoria, not by Blackheath, as the temporary terminus of the Western line. Plans to build a two-storied station at Blackheath were abandoned and this grander building was erected instead at Mount Victoria.Blue Mountains Heritage Register Review, 1999. Blackheath station opened in 1868 as a \\"halt\\" and as a platform in 1869. The Great Western Railway was intended to initially reach Bathurst but, beyond that town, its terminus was not stated. The line was duplicated between Blackheath and Mount Victoria in 1898 and the present platform building was erected on an island platform to serve both lines at that time. A signal frame was provided at the Sydney end of the building and would appear to have been open-air, later enclosed. When duplication extended from Medlow Bath to Blackheath in 1902, a new platform building was not provided. The Footbridge at Blackheath Station that provides access to the platforms was built in 1911. Its twin beam construction is typical of NSWGR practice. Since 1990, every component of the bridge, except the steel structure, has been replaced. Then Chief Executive, David Hill, authorised in 1985 the reconstruction of the 1897 building when fire virtually destroyed much of the platform building. The Blackheath reconstruction, together with the restoration of Mortuary station, marked the start of heritage management in the NSW railway organisation. Platforms and services Blackheath has one island platform with two sides. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow.  Description  The complex comprises a type 11 station building, completed in 1898 and partially reconstructed 1985. Other structures in the complex include the brick-faced island platform, completed in 1898; and the steel-framed footbridge, completed in 1911 and partially replaced in 1990. Station building External: This station building is a rare example of a large (type 11) timber island platform building. It has eight bays with cantilevered bracketed awnings to each platform elevation. Verandah brackets are plain with standard circular bracing sitting on decorative timber supports. Detailing is generally restrained with rusticated weatherboard siding and V-jointed timber panelled gable ends. Doors and windows are panelled with decorative architraves and sills, similar in design to rendered details on brick buildings from the period. A corrugated iron roof with timber fretwork gables with decorative finials to flying gable ends is a distinctive feature of the building. Two brick chimneys with corbelled tops are extant. Internal: The internal original layout of the building as well as a number of original finishes remain, however the Station Master's office together with the parcels office (at the Sydney end) have been reconstructed after the 1985 fire. The planning is linear with booking office, Station Master's office, parcels office (formerly enclosed signal box with no surviving equipment), ladies waiting and toilet and at the far end with access from the gable wall, the men's toilet. Original features include decorative moulded pressed metal ceiling to the general waiting room, double-hung sash windows with multi-paned upper sashes and coloured glazing, timber panelled doors with multi-paned fanlights, and chimney breasts. Later modifications included changes to all other room finishes including plasterboard ceilings with simple cornices, tile and carpet flooring and new toilet fittings. Island platform Blackheath Station has an island platform, completed in 1898, in slightly curved form, which is wide at the centre and narrow at both ends of the platforms. This form is typical of Blue Mountains stations dictated by the topography and the deviation of the railway line. The platform is brick faced with brick projecting edge at the top and asphalt finish to the concrete deck. Platform furniture including period light fittings, and modern signage, timber bench seating and aluminium palisade fencing at both ends of the platform are other features along the platform. A number of small garden beds with small plantings and shrubs are scattered along the northern end of the platform. Footbridge A modified standard steel beam bridge, erected in 1911, supported on steel trestles with bracing extending from the street ramp over the highway and over the Up main tracks with stairs to the island platform and to both streets. With the exception of original steel structure all components of the bridge have been replaced since the 1990s. The footbridge has contemporary canopies and metal balustrades. Landscape Station gardens, mature trees and landscaped surrounds within property boundaries adjoining the Council landscaped gardens. The plantings on the platform are not considered significant. Shops 266 Great Western Highway consists of a pair of similarly scaled and configured retail buildings. Both have gabled roofs that assume a broken backed form above verandahs that span the footpath on the eastern sides of the buildings. The external surface walls are of textured cement render and symmetrical facades are designed with central doors flanked by large display windows. The varandah roofs are supported off similarly detailed chamfered timber posts. The roof of the northern building is covered with fibro slates and features terracotta cresting and rams horn finials along the ridge. The display windows on the eastern side of the building have architraves and sills of cement render, the sills being formed into decorative scrolls and the heads being wide and splayed at each end. The door is partially glazed and divided into a number of glazed and solid panels; both door and windows have highlights over. The window at the southern end of the building is set into an arched opening and has a multi paned highlight over the main sash. The word \\"Auctioneer\\" has been formed in the cement render lining the northern wall. The roof of the southern building is covered with terracotta tiles. The architrave around the windows and door in the eastern facade are more simple in design than those of the northern building, while the building has windows in each end consisting of casement type sashes with highlights over.  Condition  As at 8 September 2008, the station building was in a good condition. Also in good condition were the platform and the footbridge. Potential archaeological features There are no known archaeological features. Although intact, the building has partially been reconstructed after the 1980s fire. Thus its integrity is moderate. Similarly, other than its steel beam structural elements the fabric of the footbridge has also been replaced in 1990 and has moderate integrity. The overall integrity of the station as a group is moderate.  Modifications and dates  *: original timber platform building was severely burnt and approximately 40% of the structure that is extant today (at the Sydney end of the building) is new fabric. *post 1990: footbridge upgraded with covered deck etc.  Further information  Also see separate listing for Blackheath Railway Station - Shops (266 Great Western Highway). The Relay Hut is not considered to be of significance and has been excluded from the listing. The nearby railway residence is in private ownership and is not part of this listing. Constructed in s the Station Master's residence is a type 5 standard railway residence (officially known as the \\"J1\\" or 'K1'). It is of brick construction with two corrugated metal hipped roofs over the main structure and the projecting bay presenting an asymmetrical facade with a side verandah featuring hipped awning supported on turned timber posts. Fenestration includes narrow tall sash windows with segmental arch lintels. Transport links Blue Mountains Transit operates two routes via Blackheath station: *698: to Katoomba *698V: Katoomba to Mount Victoria  Heritage listing  As at 22 February 2012, Blackheath Railway Station is of state significance as part of the early construction phase of railway line duplication on the upper Blue Mountains, demonstrating the technological and engineering achievements in railway construction at the end of the 19th century. The building is significant for its contribution to the scenic qualities of the Blue Mountains railway landscape, forming part of a cohesive group of intact stations along the line. The platform building at Blackheath station is an excellent representative example of a standard Federation era railway building and is one of only two timber railway buildings along the Blue Mountains line. Partial reconstruction of the building following a fire in 1985, together with the restoration of Mortuary station, marked the beginning of heritage management in the NSW railways. The place is also significant for its local setting within well landscaped gardens and adjacent to the historic town centre. The Blackheath Railway Station Shops have historical significance as an important and distinctive component of the precinct around Blackheath Railway Station. The buildings have some aesthetic significance as small Federation-era buildings with similarities in scale, detail, and form and are important elements in the local townscape. The buildings are also of significance for their associations with the prominent and influential identity Tomas Rodriguez, former Station Master at Blackheath Railway Station. Blackheath railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Blackheath Railway Station is of historical significance as part of the early construction phase of railway line duplication on the upper Blue Mountains demonstrating the technological and engineering achievements in the railway construction at the end of the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Blackheath Railway Station is a good representative example of a Federation Free Classical style railway station. The building predates the issue of standard plans, but is similar to a standard design known as Type 11 (standard A8-A10) island platform buildings. It is one of only two timber railway stations in the Blue Mountains and adapts the standard elements found in other Blue Mountains island platforms such as the wide cantilevered awning supported on steel brackets to a timber construction. The place is also significant for its local setting within well landscaped gardens and adjacent to the historic town centre. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Blackheath Railway Station has limited research potential due to its partial reconstruction and being an example of well documented type of railway structures from this period. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Blackheath Station building is a rare timber \\"type 11\\" station building, and is one of two timber railway stations in the Blue Mountains, the other is Katoomba. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Station is a representative example of a group of stations associated with the construction and duplication of the railway across the Blue Mountains. The footbridge is also a representative example of a standard steel beam structure with trestle supports dating from the early 1900s.

The treaty stipulated that the term \\"Turkey\\" in it meant the territories included in the National Oath, which had been adopted by the Ottoman Parliament on 28 January 1920. Article VI declared all treaties that had been concluded between Russia and Turkey to be null and void. Under Article II, Turkey ceded Batum and the adjacent area north of the village of Sarp to Soviet Georgia (the Kars Oblast went to Turkey). Article III instituted an autonomous Nakhichevan district under Soviet Azerbaijan's protectorate. Under Article V, the parties agreed to delegate the final elaboration of the status of the Black Sea and the Turkish Straits to a future conference of delegates of the littoral states if the \\"full sovereignty\\" and security of Turkey and \\"her capital city of Constantinople\\" were not injured. Turkey's borders, as well as those of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, as defined by the treaty as well as the nearly-identical Treaty of Kars (signed on October 13, 1921), are still in existence. After the shootdown of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24 over the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border in November 2015 and the rise of Russian‚ÄìTurkish relations, members of the Communist Party of Russia proposed annulling the Treaty of Moscow. Initially, the Russian Foreign Ministry considered that action to send a political message to the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. However, Moscow ultimately decided against the idea in its effort to de-escalate tensions with Ankara. ReferencesExternal links *\\"Treaty of Moscow.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2017.

He has variously earned praise for his industry and efficiency, and notoriety for his brutality and use of torture. He was known to be ruthless and \\"uncompromising with detainees\\". Early life Born in Derry in 1881, Tegart was the son of a Church of Ireland clergyman, Rev. Joseph Poulter Tegart of Dunboyne, County Meath. He was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen and briefly at Trinity College, Dublin. Career in India He joined the Calcutta Police in 1901, becoming head of its Detective Department. He served almost continuously in Calcutta for a period of thirty years until he was appointed a member of the Secretary of State's Indian Council in December 1931. He was the first officer of the Indian Police (IP) in the organisation and on his report the Special Branch was created. He was awarded the King's Police Medal in 1911. He became Superintendent of Police in 1908, Deputy Commissioner in 1913, Deputy- Inspector General (Intelligence) in 1918, and Commissioner of Calcutta Police from 1923 to 1931. He earned notoriety amongst the Bengal opponents of British rule, especially from independence activists. In their eyes, he was an obdurate opponent of Indian nationalism to the point of illegality. Charles Tegart was involved in a skirmish with Indian revolutionaries led by Jatindranath Mukherjee at Balasore in Orissa on 9 September 1915. Tegart was reported to have survived six assassination attempts in India and in spite of the danger he continued to drive around in an open-top car with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier riding on the bonnet. The assassination attempts included: * On 12 January 1924, at Chowringhee Road in Calcutta, by Gopinath Saha, an Indian revolutionist, who erroneously shot down a white man, Mr. Ernest Day, whom he mistook for Tegart. * On 25 August 1930, at Dalhousie Square in Calcutta, by throwing a bomb into the car in which Tegart was travelling, but Tegart shot down the revolutionary and escaped unhurt. Tegart's efficiency in curbing the revolutionary activities of the Indians came in for praise from Lord Lytton, then Governor of Bengal. He was awarded the KCIE in the 1937 Coronation Honours. Prior to his roles in India, he served as chief assistant to Ormonde Winter, the head of British intelligence operations in Ireland during the Black and Tan period. As a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin he retained contacts there and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1933. Career in Palestine In view of his expertise, the British authorities sent him to the British Mandate of Palestine, then in the throes of the Arab Revolt, to advise the Inspector General on matters of security. He arrived there in December 1937. In due course he advised the construction of 77 reinforced concrete police stations and posts which could be defended against attack, and of a frontier fence along the northern border of Palestine to control the movement of insurgents, goods and weapons. His recommendations were accepted and 62 new \\"Tegart forts\\",Anton La Guardia, \\"Jericho Jail Creates Own Modern History\\", Arab News, 24 March 2006. as they came to be known, were built throughout Palestine, however all but a few located along the Lebanese border were built after the Arab Revolt, in 1940‚Äì41.Seth J. Frantzman, \\"Tegart‚Äôs shadow\\" , Jerusalem Post, 21 October 2011. Many of them are still in use, some by Israeli forces and others by Palestinian ones, while others were destroyed in various rounds of fighting. It is recorded that suspects underwent brutal questioning by the Mandatory police, involving humiliation and the Turkish practice of falaka (beating prisoners on the soles of their feet), but a Tegart researcher concluded that there is no proof to be found in Tegart's personal papers in support of the accusations that he built interrogation centres or that he developed new torture techniques. World War II In 1942, Tegart headed up operations at the Ministry of Food in wartime Britain to combat the black market. Personal life For some time, Tegart kept a defused bomb as a paperweight to remind him of the attempts on his life. He once threw the bomb in a moment of anger, only to have it explode against the wall of his office, an incident he reportedly considered amusing. Tegart died at his home of age-related disease.

It was designed by NSW Government Railways and built from 1868 to 1913 by Allan McClean and James Barrie . It is also known as Mount Victoria Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station opened on 6 September 1869.Mount Victoria Station NSWrail.net The Platform 2 building dates from 1869 with a railway refreshment room added in 1884. The Platform 1 building dates from 1911 when the line was duplicated. An extensive yard including a locomotive depot existed west of the station.  History  Mount Victoria has always been an important railway centre since its opening in 1868. It was the first platform structure made of material other than timber built after Penrith station. The original station building still remains and was to a design consistent with the time of John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways. Further additions were carried out in 1899 to the ladies' toilet and other areas. The parcels office was added in 1911 to the Sydney end of the building. In 1884, the two level stone addition containing the Railway Refreshment Room was built under the supervision of George Cowdery, Engineer-in-Chief for Existing Lines and was built by George Dengate. The Refreshment Room contained on the upper level eight bedrooms for travellers and quarters for the Manager and family, again typical of NSW practice. Alterations to the Refreshment Room occurred in 1919 and additional bedrooms were built at the rear in 1943. The Refreshment Room closed in 1957. A locomotive depot existed at Mount Victoria in 1897 and was greatly expanded in 1911-13 when duplication of the line through Mount Victoria was completed. The depot was home to the locomotives and crews who worked the famous \\"The Fish\\" commuter train to Sydney. Mount Victoria also was the destination of the Caves Express from Sydney, which conveyed holidaymakers to the Blue Mountains. The construction of accommodation for enginemen, train guards and other on-board staff has been provided by the NSW Government Railways from the 1880s. In the late 1890s, a standard design of barracks was approved. Those at Mount Victoria reflected a standard arrangement with rows of four bedrooms on each side of the building. There was also a central kitchen and meal room, reflected in the roofscape by a large transverse gable. A toilet and Attendant's Room completed the plan. It continues also to be used for non-overnight purposes, for meals and locker accommodation. Also on the Lithgow-bound platform is an elevated signal box. It was constructed in 1911 and continues in service (2009). It is built to the typical elevated signal box design dominant between 1910 and 1920. A free-standing male toilet was built towards the western end of the Lithgow-bound platform in 1900. The verandah posts which supported the original platform awnings on the Lithgow- bound platform were removed in 1927. This was part of a programme to modernise the appearance of platform buildings by the use of large brackets which had begun in the 1890s under Chief Commissioner, E.M.G. Eddy. The present Sydney- bound platform was built to serve the duplication west to Hartley in 1911, and the present buildings provided. It featured a second Railway Refreshment Room with the traditional lantern roof, which closed in 1957. The 1911 Up platform building is roofed with slates. This is possibly the last station to utilise slates as a roofing material. The station's history is closely linked to Jenolan Caves. The station was the destination for the famous \\"Caves Express\\" which operated between the 1920s and 1942 conveying holidaymakers to the Blue Mountains. It was also the nightly destination of the famous \\"The Fish\\" train from Sydney. It was the only destination on the NSW railway system to have two named trains terminate one for commuters and the other for tourists. The pedestrian footbridge linking both platforms was of truss form and built in 1911, replacing an earlier c.1896 bridge. It is largely in original condition and is typical of the design used throughout the NSW railway system. A Station Master's Cottage was also constructed in 1868 and was similar to another 11 residences on the Blue Mountains built in stone. The structure was demolished over 30 years ago but the keystone showing the date of construction is still extant. It is now located in the Baden Powell Park, Mount Victoria. The history of the cottage is important as it illustrates that residences not always reflected the status of the occupant. In this case, the Station Master received the same type and size structure as did Gatekeepers on the line. Platforms and services Mount Victoria has two side platforms. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services travelling from Sydney Central to Lithgow. Some services terminate at Mount Victoria and stable in the sidings west of the station. The Bathurst Bullet operates 2 evening services to Bathurst. Journey Beyond's weekly Indian Pacific also passes through Mount Victoria, but stops when traveling towards Sydney only.  Description  The complex includes a type 3, second class, sub-type 1, stone station building for platform 2, erected in 1869 with a refreshment room, erected in 1884; and a type 11, brick station building for platform 1, erected in 1913; platform 1 Lavatory Block 1 (); platform 2 Lavatory Block (); a signal box - type E, 48 lever, brick on platform 2 (1911); barracks/Rest house, brick (1911-1913); and the site of the former Station Master's Cottage (1868). Other structures include a part stone and part brick faced platform 1, erected in the 1870s; a brick faced platform 2, erected in 1911; a footbridge (1911); and various other structures. Station building platform 2 (1869, 1884) External: Constructed of stone with a slate roof the station building on Platform 2 is a \\"type 3\\", second class station building altered to include refreshment rooms on the upper level with later brick extensions to both Up and Down ends. Its key features include a large two-storey central stone building flanked by attached stone and brick single-storey wing structures, a hipped slate roof to main building, gambrel roof to the Up end wing and flat roof to Down end wing, timber framed double-hung windows and timber panelled doors with standard iron brackets over decorative corbels supporting wide platform awnings, fretted timber work to both ends of awnings. The main two- storey central building features four tall brick chimneys with stone base and tops (one with chimney pot), bracketed eaves and segmental arched tall windows to the upper level. The single-storey sandstone south wing is part of the original station building with pitched slate roof and brick extension with corrugated metal gambrel roof and a brick chimney. The stone eaves of the original south wing are visible over the later platform awning. The south wing (ladies room) is a painted brick on the platform side and face brick on the car park side featuring tall face brick chimneys with corbelled tops and double-hung timber framed windows. An enclosed cantilevered balcony is located on the west side of the central wing, supported on cast iron brackets with iron lace (mostly removed). A ground floor brick and weatherboard skillion addition with a tall brick chimney is also located on the west side of the central wing. Internal: The original layout of the station building in its extended form remains. The room arrangement on the ground floor includes combined station master's office, ticket office and booking office, general waiting room, and ladies room. The upper level accommodates the local museum with entry via the rear staircase. The station refreshment rooms no longer function. The original internal finishes include decorative plaster ceiling and moulded plaster cornices to the waiting room and ladies waiting room, moulded timber architraves to original building joinery, plasterboard ceilings to amenities, and tile and carpet floorings. All fireplaces have been enclosed. Station building platform 1 (1913) External: A single-storey building with slate gabled roof, gabled lantern roof to the centre and terracotta ridge capping. The walls are of face brick with black tuckpointed red brick jack arches to the openings. The walls have a brick plinth with red splay bricks. The south 5 bays are recessed with red bricks to the head of the recesses. The platform side of the building has timber framed double-hung windows with multi-paned upper sashes and double doors with coloured multi- pane fanlights. A double-hung ticket window is also located at the south end of the building. The building has various gabled wings at the rear. A cantilevered awning over the platform is supported on steel brackets on stanchions. It returns around the south side of the building and extends north to link with the lavatory building. A fretwork valance finishes the bay between the platform building and the lavatory. The half timber panelled gable end is visible behind the awnings. Internal: The Platform 1 building is generally used by station staff and consists of two locked rooms and a general waiting room in the centre. The waiting room features decorative plaster ceiling, moulded timber architraves to window and door surrounds, a timber moulded dado above rendered dado line, timber skirting board and bricked in fireplace. Staff rooms were not accessible. Platform 1 Lavatory Block () External: A single-storey face brick men's lavatory building with a parapeted gable on the platform side featuring roughcast frieze between moulded string courses. The roof is of corrugated metal with exposed rafters. The other features include a four-panelled door with arched fanlight, a louvered/fixed window on the north side with segmental brick arch and decorative stone sill, and a double window on the platform elevation with louvered upper sashes, segmental arch and decorative stone sill. Platform 2 Lavatory Block () External: A single storey face brick gabled building with a brick screen wall on the south side providing privacy to the men's' toilet entry. The building has a corrugated metal roof and plain bargeboards. The door and window openings have segmental arch lintels with louvers to the windows on east side and slots for ventilation in the gable ends. Signal box (1911) External: A large two-storey face-brick and timber signal box with a corrugated iron gabled roof featuring simple bargeboards, turned timber finial and boxed eaves. The gable end is clad with rusticated weatherboards and has a timber vent. The signal box is located on the Platform 2 (Down side) with the floor level raised above platform level. It has 6-pane horizontal sliding band windows on the upper floor some with internal steel security mesh. There are 9-pane arched windows on the ground floor with rendered sills. Access is via steel stairs to a landing on the south elevation. Internal: The signal box retains many of its original/early equipment within a refurbished and interiors including plasterboard panelled ceilings, modern light fittings, vinyl floor coverings, modern kitchen facility and cupboards. Early timber panelled walls in the store room still exist. The 48 lever interlocking machine is still in operation. Barracks/Rest House (1911 - 1913) External: Located to the northeast of the station near No.26 Patrick Street, the barracks building is a single-storey gabled building on north-south axis with enclosed verandahs on the east and west elevations. The building is constructed of face brickwork, stretcher bond to the end walls, and Flemish bond under the verandahs. The gables have plain bargeboards with fretted timber boards to enclosed verandah ends. The large roof has been sheeted with corrugated metal. A large brick gable on the east side facing Patrick Street marks the original entry and is emphasized by a breakfront in the verandah. The verandah feature fibrocement panels to the bottom with brick base and band single-pane louvered windows to the upper portion. A brick chimney is located on the kitchen side of the building. Internal: The floor layout of the barracks has been altered. An outer passageway exists, which was formally the verandah and external facades. Double-hung windows with simple concrete window sills, timber doors and simple face-brick walls are evident with ventilation grilles along the concrete base. The interior consists of six bedrooms, and a communal kitchen and lounge room area. Floors are tiled and modern fluorescent lights have been installed. Rooms were refurbished with modern skirting boards, architraves, bathroom amenities, and kitchen facilities. Site of former Station Master's Cottage (1868) The site of former Station Master's Cottage was built in 1868 and was constructed of stone similar to the pointsman's cottage at Glenbrook. The cottage was located a short distance to the south of the station and continued to be occupied by successive station masters until the twentieth century. It was demolished in 1934 when it became redundant and in poor condition due to vacancy for a long period. The site of the former cottage is now in a park named after Errol Barden, a Blue Mountains Shire Council employee who took a special interest in the environment of Mount Victoria. Platform 1 (1870) Platform 1 is a curved side platform and constructed of part stone and part brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. The platform is highly vegetated along the eastern side rocky escarpments with various mature trees, shrubs and potted plants along the length of the platform. The platform also features period and modern light fittings, timber bench seating, a number of early and modern signage and aluminium palisade fencing to both ends of the platform. Platform 2 (1911) Platform 2 is a roadside platform and constructed of brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. It was widened at the time of duplication and the addition of the new awning. This platform is also highly vegetated with various mature trees, shrubs and potted plants along the length of the platform. It also features period and modern light fittings, timber bench seating, early and modern signage, an early bubbler and aluminium palisade fencing to both ends and along the street side of the platform. Footbridge (1911) The footbridge is a standard Warren truss trestle and stairway with Hardie board long plank timber deck and channel iron stair stringers. The railing is supported on curved mild steel brackets. The footbridge connects both platforms and as the station is situated in a cutting, it extends on one side to the top of the embankment to connect to Patrick Street in the east and Station Street to the west. The balustrades to the stairs are timber post and handrail with wire mesh infill while the sides of the bridge enclosed with corrugated metal sheeting.

The station features a numerous collection of flora ranging from mature trees, shrubs and potted plants along both platforms, adding to the historic character of the station group. Potential archaeological features There are no known potential archaeological elements on the station. However, a number of remnant sidings, levers and giants from the earlier electrification system exist along the rock escarpment of Platform 1 and may have archaeological potential. The site of the former Station Master's cottage also has archaeological potential.  Condition  *Platform 1 Station Building - Good *Platform 2 Station Building - Generally Good Condition (cement render at the bottom of the stone walls detrimental to the stone walls) *Lavatory Blocks - Very Good externally *Signal Box - Very good *Barracks/Rest House - Generally in Good condition *Site of former SM's cottage - not inspected *Platforms - Good *Footbridge - Generally Good with evidence of natural wear & rusting The overall integrity of the station and its buildings is high. The majority of the buildings at the station are intact with minor changes to their exteriors. Although modified, the barracks maintains their overall integrity at a moderate level. The footbridge has high integrity and intactness.  Modifications and dates  *1868 - 1884: Platform 2 station building extended to provide refreshment rooms with extended awning, rear awning removed *1891: Minor renovations and extension to awning of Platform 2 station building. *1898: Additions and repairs to Platform 2 station building. *1902: Improvements to Platform 2 station building. *1993: Internal upgrade works to Platform 1 and Platform 2 station buildings *N.d: Ticket window at south end of Platform 1 station building bricked up and the cantilevered balcony has most cast iron removed and is infilled with fibro and louvred windows. *N.d: Flush doors added to barracks building, internal layout altered, and the verandah enclosed with fibro and louvres.

Transport links Blue Mountains Transit operates one route to and from Mount Victoria station: *698V: to Katoomba  Heritage listing  Mount Victoria Railway Station Group is of state significance as a large complex of buildings illustrating clearly the pattern of development of railway facilities in the Blue Mountains area. It is the most substantial railway station complex in the Blue Mountains and indicates the former importance of the location with the former locomotive depot (now demolished) to service terminating trains for railway tourism associated with Jenolan Caves and handling goods trains over the steep grades of the Blue Mountains, particularly the section to Lithgow. The structures indicate the importance of Mount Victoria as a health and holiday resort, the RRR accommodation provided in the station building reinforcing this. The Mount Victoria Railway Station Group has a high degree of research potential for its ability to demonstrate construction techniques and architectural character of various types of buildings in one station. The station is a fine example of railway architecture including Victorian Regency and Federation buildings and is an important landmark in the townscape of Mt Victoria being located at the lower end of the town at the termination of the main street vista. The Mount Victoria Railway barracks is an unusual surviving example of a purpose built rest-house still used by the railways for staff accommodation. The signal box is one of a few examples of brick on platform elevated signal boxes that remain in operation in the state. The footbridge is rare as an intact example of a standard Warren Truss trestle and stairway with channel iron stair stringers. The overall aesthetic character of the station is further enhanced by the setting of the station within the rock escarpment, a typical natural setting of the Blue Mountains stations, featuring a collection of numerous flora ranging from mature trees, shrubs and potted plants along both platforms. The Mount Victoria Railway Station is associated with John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways, as the original station building was built to a design from his time, and with George Cowdery, Engineer-in-Chief for Existing Lines, as the two-level stone addition containing the Railway Refreshment Room was built under his supervision. Mount Victoria railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The historical importance of Mount Victoria Railway Station Group as a railway location is demonstrated by a variety of high quality buildings which clearly show the development of the Station over time, particularly between 1872 and 1912, illustrating clearly the growth and decline of railway facilities in the Blue Mountains area. Mt Victoria was a convenient place to construct a locomotive facility (now demolished) to service terminating trains to serve railway tourism associated with the Jenolan Caves and handling goods trains over the steep grades of the Blue Mountains, particularly the section to Lithgow. The structures indicate the importance of Mt Victoria as a health and holiday resort, the Railway Refreshment Rooms and accommodation provided in the station building reinforcing this. The Mount Victoria Railway Rest- House (Barracks) is associated with the duplication of the railway line over the Blue Mountains in 1910 and is significant for its continued use as accommodation. The Station Group is the most substantial railway station complex in the Blue Mountains, demonstrating clear layers of growth from its original construction as a terminus station, through its growth at the turn of the century to the duplication of the railway line. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Mount Victoria Railway Station is associated with John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways, as the original Station building was built to a design from his time, and with George Cowdery, Engineer-in-Chief for Existing Lines, as the two-level stone addition containing the Railway Refreshment Room was built under his supervision. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Mount Victoria Railway Station Group is of aesthetic significance for its cohesive group of Victorian Regency and Federation buildings and is an important landmark in the townscape of Mt Victoria, being located at the lower end of the town at the termination of the main street vista. While contemporary with the majority of station buildings surviving on the Blue Mountains railway line, the Platform 1 building and adjoining lavatory building do not derive from the standard pattern used for those buildings as it has been built for a side platform rather than an island platform. It has high quality detailing with its brick detailing, clearstory window and use or roughcast render. The signal box on Platform 2 is a representative example of its type, adapted to suit the side platform rather than the more typical island platform. It is a well detailed building designed and orientated to maximize views of the lines in each direction. The Mount Victoria barracks has a simple gabled form with wide verandahs and has been modified significantly yet still provides an example of a former rest-house facility established within close proximity of the railway line. The overall aesthetic character of the station is further enhanced by the setting of the station within the rock escarpment, a typical natural setting of the Blue Mountains stations, featuring a collection of numerous flora ranging from mature trees, shrubs and potted plants along both platforms. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Mount Victoria Railway Station Group has a high degree of research potential for its demonstrative ability in providing construction techniques and architectural character of various types of buildings in one station. The station building on Platform 2 is of particular research significance for its staged construction over time to accommodate different staff and passenger needs. The site of the former SM's cottage also has archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Mount Victoria Station group is a rare Victorian era railway station combining a number of individually significant buildings and structures. The signal box is one of a few brick on platform signal boxes remaining in the state. The Railway Refreshment Rooms, though no longer used for their original purpose, are rare examples of such railway facility associated with the station's important location. The barracks are relatively rare in the metro area (8 in 2009) though at least 37 remain in NSW. While of later construction it is representative of the late 1890s standard design of rest-house that provided accommodation to railway staff. The footbridge is rare as an intact example of a standard Warren Truss trestles and stairway with Hardie Board long plank timber deck and channel iron stair stringers as almost all similar footbridges have been replaced with concrete. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Mount Victoria Railway Station Group is a representative example of a substantial railway station complex combining various types, periods and styles of buildings dating from the 19th Century and early 20th Century, each individually representing their standard designs and types. The footbridge is an intact representative example of a standard Warren Truss trestle footbridge with stairway, Hardie Board long plank timber deck and channel iron stair stringers. The barracks, although modified still demonstrates the key characteristics of standard accommodation for railway staff constructed during the early 20th Century.

The 1922 partition of Ireland left Northern Ireland with a large Irish nationalist minority, mostly in the south and west, but with significant numbers in Belfast and some smaller communities in the north and east, whilst Irish unionists constitute a majority of the population in the north and east, with some smaller communities in the south and west. The geographical area in which unionists are a majority is less than half of Northern Ireland, but eastern areas have a much higher population density. Northern Ireland is divided between Unionist, Nationalist and 'Other' designations. Overt Unionist parties secured just eight of the 18 seats in the 2019 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland (compared with eleven in the 2017 UK general election). (Nationalists secured nine seats and the non-aligned Alliance party, one). The (overtly) Unionist parties's share of the vote fell again, to 42.5%. For demographic reasons, the traditional Unionist vote is expected to continue to decline and the Nationalist vote to increase but the expectation that people will vote along sectarian lines is no longer as strong as it once was. , none of the proposals for repartition are supported by any registered political party in Ireland. A map showing the current Irish border  1920 to 1969  A de facto border was established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, in which the British Government established (or attempted to establish) two devolved administrations within the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. The former consisted of north-easterly six of the nine counties of Ulster; the latter of the remaining 26 (including three of Ulster). In 1925, the Irish Boundary Commission was established to consider whether a more appropriate border might be drawn. On 7 November 1925 an English Conservative newspaper, The Morning Post, published leaked notes of the negotiations, including a draft map. The overall effects of the Boundary Commission's recommendations would have been the transfer of 286 square miles to the Free State and 77 square miles to Northern Ireland.'The Irish Border: History, Politics, Culture' By Malcolm Anderson, Eberhard Bort, pg. 96 The leaked report included, accurately, the Boundary Commission recommendation that parts of east Donegal would be transferred to Northern Ireland, plus several other small tracts (see list here). Only 1 in every 25 Northern Irish Catholics would have been placed under Free State rule. The Boundary Commission's recommendations would have shortened the border by 51 miles (approx. 18%). The press leak effectively ended the Commission's work.Paul Bew \\"Ireland: The Politics of Enmity, 1789‚Äì2006\\" (Oxford University Press, 2007) p.447. The three governments, however, determined another agreement on 6 December 1925 (subject to parliamentary approval) which confirmed the existing boundary of Northern Ireland, along with other matters.D√°il √âireann - Volume 13 - 7 December 1925: TREATY (CONFIRMATION OF AMENDING AGREEMENT) BILL, 1925. Line 1300 This new agreement was approved by the D√°il (the lower house of the Free State parliament) by a vote of 71 to 20,D√°il √âireann - Volume 13 - 10 December 1925: PRIVATE BUSINESS. - TREATY (CONFIRMATION OF AMENDING AGREEMENT) BILL, 1925‚ÄîSECOND STAGE (Resumed). Line 1769 and in Westminster by the \\"Ireland (Confirmation of Agreement) Act\\" that was passed unanimously by the British parliament on 8‚Äì9 December. The Agreement was then formally registered with the League of Nations on 8 February 1926. The 1937 Constitution of Ireland described the whole island of Ireland as the \\"National Territory\\", but this irredentist claim was dropped by the Nineteenth Amendment that permitted the Irish government to ratify the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  1969 to 1980  To the left is a map showing the religious divisions in Ireland in 1991 (based on the census of both states, the United Kingdom and the Census#Republic of Ireland). Areas in which the majority of the population was Protestant/unionist/loyalist are shown in green, whilst areas in which the majority of the population was Catholic/nationalist/republican are shown in blue. To the right is an image of a proposed settlement of a repartitioned island. Many areas of Northern Ireland would have been ceded to the RoI. Those areas which would remain part of Northern Ireland (and thus stay in the UK) are shown in green, while those areas which would have formed the enlarged Republic are shown in blue. Red lines denote county boundaries. Repartition resurfaced as a possible option with the start of the Troubles. In 1972, the Conservative MP Julian Critchley published a pamphlet for the Bow Group advocating repartition, titled Ireland: A New Partition. In the mid-1970s Northern Ireland Secretary Merlyn Rees considered the possibility of ceding the IRA stronghold of South Armagh to the Republic, deciding against the matter as the Dublin authorities would likewise be unable to stop IRA activity in the area.Harnden, Toby. Bandit Country: the IRA and South Armagh, pg. 148-49. Conservative MP David James pressed Prime Minister Harold Wilson to approach the Republic to see if they would be willing to swap South Armagh for areas of northern County Monaghan; Wilson was apparently keen on the idea, but thought that the government in Dublin would be unenthusiastic.Harnden, Toby. Bandit Country: the IRA and South Armagh, pg. 149. In 2003 secret plans were published for the first time, revealing that in 1972 civil servants in London had prepared a \\"last-ditch\\" plan for possible use in the event of a full-scale civil war, which would have seen Roman Catholic inhabitants of the northeast forcibly moved to Fermanagh, southern Londonderry, Tyrone, South Armagh and South Down. Protestant inhabitants of those areas would have been moved into North Down, Antrim, Northern Londonderry and North Armagh. The nationalist areas would then have been ceded to the Republic of Ireland. An alternative plan simply involved \\"moving individual Catholics from their homes in Northern Ireland to new homes in the Republic\\". In a 2006 essay, Garret FitzGerald, the Republic's Foreign Minister in 1974, revealed his government's opinions on repartition or a complete British withdrawal. 1980 to 1998 Pollsters have rarely asked the population of Northern Ireland about their attitudes to repartition but it was asked twice in the early 1980s. In June 1981 and February 1982, the percentages of Protestants agreeing to repartition was 9% and 8%; the percentages for Catholics were 22% and 24%.John Whyte, Interpreting Northern Ireland (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 82. Research by Paul Compton of Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) fed into a secret 1984 briefing paper prepared by the Northern Ireland Office for then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which examined various repartition schemes, the most extensive transferring to the Republic half of Northern Ireland's territory and one- third of its population, with West Belfast a \\"walled ghetto\\" enclave. The plans were quickly dismissed as impractical and politically unworkable. Later in 1984, then-Taoisaeach Garret FitzGerald spoke against repartition as reinforcing partition. In 1986, QUB economic historian Liam Kennedy published a book-length study of repartition called Two Ulsters: A Case for Repartition. During the late 1980s, repartition was repeatedly proposed by assorted individuals and small groups. It became popular in some sections of the Ulster nationalist movement, who were keen to establish a state with a large Protestant majority. Conversely, the Ulster Movement for Self-Determination proposed an enlarged state of Ulster, including all the historic province. This state, were it to have been created, would have had almost equal numbers of nationalists and unionists. In early January 1994, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) released a document calling for repartition combined with ethnic cleansing, with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant.Wood, Ian S. Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Pages 184‚Äì185. The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. The vastly Irish Catholic and nationalist areas would be handed over to the Republic, and those left stranded in the \\"Protestant state\\" would be \\"expelled, nullified, or interned\\". The story was printed in the Sunday Independent newspaper on 16 January. The \\"doomsday plan\\" was based on the work of Liam Kennedy, though he had not proposed ethnic cleansing. Sammy Wilson, then press officer for the Democratic Unionist Party and later the MP for East Antrim, spoke positively of the document, calling it a \\"valuable return to reality\\" and lauded the UDA for \\"contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity\\". Margaret Thatcher said in 1998 that when it became obvious that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was in trouble, she too had considered repartition, although she had not pursued the idea.

Dweik, as speaker of the PLC, is recognized by many Palestinians including those living in Gaza, as being the Interim President of the Palestinian National Authority since 19 October 2016 when the national unity government was dissolved. He was also recognized as the interim president from 15 January 2009, when the elected term of Mahmoud Abbas officially expired, until 2 June 2014, when the national unity government was formed. Education and family life Prior to becoming involved in political office, Dweik was a professor of urban geography at An-Najah National University in Nablus on the West Bank. He holds a PhD in Regional and Architecture Planning from the University of Pennsylvania. Dweik is married, with seven children. One of his daughters is a school principal, and three of his other children are students of medicine or pharmacy. Dweik's wife runs a daycare centre out of the family's house named Marj al-Zohour, after the place in Lebanon where her husband spent a year in exile in 1992. Political views Dweik has told journalists that he views the Hamas charter's call for the creation of a Palestinian state in all of Palestine, including Israel, to be \\"nothing but a dream, and unrealistic,\\" and he believes that Hamas is aiming for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. He has never been accused of involvement in terrorism. His primary focus since his release from prison has been reconciling the Hamas and Fatah factions who have been engaged in a civil conflict, the result of which has been a split in the ruling PNA government, with Hamas ruling in Gaza and Fatah in the West Bank. Political career Duweik has been associated with The Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas since as early as 1992. At that time, Hamas was an organization that had been banned by Israel and he never admitted to being a member, though he spoke to Western journalists about Hamas as someone who held knowledge of the organization and its aims. Duweik was careful to dissociate himself from the military actions carried out by Hamas, even though Hamas's early military raids, described as \\"effective, and deadly,\\" were directed at Israeli occupation forces, not at civilians.Suicide bombings were only adopted as a tactic by the armed wing beginning in 1994 and were officially foresworn by 2005. In 1992, a separate military wing was established called the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades so that the political wing of Hamas could be distinguished from the military one. Exile to Lebanon In 1992, Dweik was among 415 Palestinians associated with Hamas or the Islamic Jihad who were arrested and exiled to southern Lebanon by the Israeli administration of Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin acknowledged that those exiled were not armed militants, but people who represented the Hamas \\"infrastructure\\". Driven to the northern border with Lebanon, he and the others were dropped off in the de-militarized zone between the two countries and warned not to come back. Lebanon refused to allow them entry, so Duweik and his compatriots remained in no-man's land. They lived in tents and built their own showers and also set up an organized hierarchical system whereby Duweik was in charge of the deportees from the West Bank, while Abdel Aziz al- Rantisi was in charge of those from the Gaza Strip. After a year, Rabin agreed to let them come back. 2006 elections Duweik ran for a position in the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in the January 2006 elections on the Change and Reform list, made up primarily of Hamas members. The victory of Hamas in the elections prompted Israel and the United States to cut off ties to the new government, maintaining contact only with Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority, and not Ismail Haniyeh, its new prime minister, or any other elected parliamentarians from Hamas, including Duweik. The US immediately suspended aid to the new government, and some other Western governments were considering the same, when Duweik was sworn in as Speaker of the House on 29 March 2006. During the proceedings, which were held by video conference due to a ban on travel instituted by Israel and affecting Hamas members, among the things Duweik said were: \\"A hungry man is an angry man [...] We hope the world will not allow the Palestinian people to suffer, because this will only make people more radical.\\" He also said: \\"My message to Israel is to put an end to the occupation, and then there will be no fighting.\\" In an April 2006 interview with Ynet, the Israeli media outlet, Duweik responded to a question regarding Israel's announcement of a plan to collapse the new government using economic and other means as follows: > \\"I say that the occupier has, according to treaties, obligations to the > occupied. I also say that the money the Israelis say they don't want to > transfer [$55 million in tax revenues] is not Israeli money, it is > Palestinian money that Israel collects from the Palestinians, and which it > is obligated to give to the Authority. If Israel preserves this stance, then > the law will have to decide between us over this issue. This plan is another > Israeli attempt to harm the democratic process and its outcomes, a process > that was free, transparent, and which took place before the whole world's > eyes. This is an attempt to harm us, but we are lions, not ants. It's not > easy to harm us.\\" 2006 arrest Dweik was arrested by Israel on 29 June 2006 as part of Israel's Operation Summer Rains. He was later released and then rearrested 6 August 2006. Dweik says he was severely beaten while in custody, and his lawyers say that he was held in unsanitary conditions. In August 2006, Dweik was charged in Israel for being a member of Hamas and for being in contact with Khaled Mashal, the exiled secretary-general of Hamas. He expressed his view that this was a \\"political trial\\" and stated that he did not recognize it. He accused Israel of using \\"political blackmail\\", and said that his arrest was in violation of international law. Dweik (along with a number of other Palestinian ministers and parliament members) was imprisoned in spite of his parliamentary immunity.\\"The Council of Europe‚Äôs parliamentary assembly president, Rene van der Linden, slammed yesterday Israel's arrest of the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council, Aziz Dweik, and called for his immediate release. 'All legitimately elected parliamentarians enjoy parliamentary immunity unless and until they are divested of it by their own parliaments,' van den Linden said.\\" Support up for Hamas vow to destroy Israel 2009 release Israel released Dweik two months before the end of his three-year sentence. Released from Hadarim prison near Tel Aviv, he was then transferred to an Israeli military checkpoint outside the city of Tulkarm. He stated, \\"Any person deprived of his freedom feels an enormous hardship.\\" Dweik's release came after a military tribunal near Ramallah which rejected an application by prosecutors to keep him detained, presumably because of his bad health.Hamas parliament Speaker released BBC News.

His first appearance was in the comic book Hellboy: Seed of Destruction issue #1 (1994). Fictional character biography An English academic well versed in the supernatural, Trevor Bruttenholm was a member of the British Paranormal Society. He was an advisor to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt when the Allies realized that the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was racing to use the occult to turn the tide of World War II. Project Ragna Rok, a plan to use black magic to win the war, was put in place by the supposedly deceased mystic Rasputin. However, on December 23, 1944 in East Bromwich, England, a youthful demon came into the possession of Bruttenholm, not Rasputin. Rasputin retreated to the Arctic and Bruttenholm named the creature 'Hellboy'. Bruttenholm and Hellboy developed a very strong emotional bond like that of a father and son, and both joined the U.S. Government's new Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. The two worked closely together to combat supernatural threats to the world. Bruttenholm eventually retired from the Bureau and returned to field work. His position was taken over by Tom Manning, who is the current Bureau director. An aged Bruttenholm disappeared in 1992 during the Cavendish expedition to the Arctic Circle. Bruttenholm turned up, alive, in 1994 during the Seed of Destruction arc. Before he could explain himself to Hellboy, he was murdered by a 'frog monster', the first of thousands of such beasts the Bureau would eventually face. Bruttenholm's death signalled the first contact Hellboy would have with emissaries of the Ogdru Jahad. The man who was ultimately responsible for Bruttenholm's death was a revitalized Rasputin, whom Bruttenholm had encountered in the North. Hellboy stopped Rasputin's plans to free the Ogdru Jahad and saw the mystic burn alive for his crime. In other media=Live action filmHellboy (2004)= Trevor Bruttenholm appears in the 2004 motion picture Hellboy, first as a young man in 1944 (played by Kevin Trainor), then as the B.P.R.D.'s aging director in the 2000s (played by John Hurt). In the film, \\"Broom\\" accompanies the team of American commandos to stop Rasputin from initiating Project Ragna Rok. He receives a bullet in the leg from Karl Ruprecht Kroenen that causes him to limp for the rest of his life, but throws a hand grenade under the portal machine that both destroys the machine and maims Kroenen as he is attempting to retrieve it. When the infant Hellboy appears, Broom adopts him and dedicates himself to raising Hellboy as a human, despite his demonic origins. The film makes the father-son relationship between the two characters more explicit, with Hellboy always calling Broom \\"Father.\\" As the movie begins in the present, Broom discovers that he is dying of cancer, and selects the young agent John Myers to serve as Hellboy's new liaison. He is killed by Rasputin as part of a plot to lure Hellboy to Rasputin's grave, where he can fulfil the purpose he was summoned to Earth for. Before he is killed, Rasputin taunts him, saying that Broom has effectively nurtured a creature with the power, and the destiny, to bring about the Apocalypse, and also shows him a vision of the post-apocalyptic remains of New York City, with the Ogdru Jahad looming overhead and Hellboy, with regenerated horns, standing in the center. Broom returns that he will always see Hellboy as his son, Rasputin respectfully promises the death will be quick and Broom accepts his fate and allows Kroenen to kill him. When Hellboy is about to unlock the key that will release the Ogdru Jahad from their prison as Anung un Rama, Myers stops him by throwing him a rosary that belonged to Broom, a reminder that Broom raised him to choose his own path - upon which Hellboy tears away his re-grown horns and kills Rasputin rather than turn the final key. The creators of the comic book have stated in interviews that Hurt's portrayal of Bruttenholm was uncanny, as though he had been the original model for the comics character. =Hellboy II: The Golden Army= Bruttenholm only appeared in the sequel film's flashback prologue, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, played again by Hurt. Taking place in 1955, the middle-aged Bruttenholm is raising the young Hellboy in secret on a U.S. Air Force base in New Mexico. On Christmas Eve, he reads his \\"son\\" a story about the creation of the Golden Army. In the present, Hellboy wears his father's rosary beads on his wrist, like a bracelet. =Hellboy (2019)= Ian McShane portrayed Professor Trevor Bruttenholm in the film reboot Hellboy. This version of Trevor was a narrator in the prologue, and Hellboy does not take orders from him after he meant to kill him when he came from hell, but instead raised him as his \\"son\\" to be the best Hellboy himself. Later, in the climax, Broom was killed by Nimue when Hellboy refuses to withdraw Excalibur that enrages him to. While demons are spreading around the world, Alice Monaghan channels Broom's spirit to encourage Hellboy to decapitate Nimue, returning her and demons to hell. After revealing the truth about Hellboy's arrival, Broom bids farewell to his \\"son\\". Animated filmsHellboy Animated: Blood and Iron= Trevor Bruttenholm also appeared in the straight-to-DVD animated film Hellboy: Blood and Iron, voiced as a young man by James Arnold Taylor, and as an elderly man by Hurt again. In the film, a series of flashbacks (in reverse chronological order) show the young Bruttenholm traveling to Eastern Europe to combat Erzebet Andrushko, an evil vampiress who has been terrorizing Transylvania. He emerges victorious, though the only survivor of his team. Sixty years later, he is still a member of the Bureau, though no longer Director of Field Operations. Experiencing recurring nightmares of Erzebet's resurrection, he suggests that the entire team be sent on an apparently trivial mission in the Hamptons, where Erzebet's disciples are indeed working to bring her back. Despite the dangerous creatures fought by the other members of the team, it is Bruttenholm who confronts Erzebet, alone, and manages, despite his age, to outwit and destroy her again.

History The Glad brand originated in the United States in 1963 when Union Carbide owner and CEO, David Darroch, launched Glad Wrap, a polyethylene film used as a food wrap. Douglas G. Taylor was transferred that same year from the Union Carbide facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to spearhead the Glad Wrap project. Taylor headed sales and marketing for Glad products until he was retired from Union Carbide in 1985 after putting together the sale of Union Carbide's Home and Automotive Products division to First Brands Corporation. At the time of the sale, Taylor was Senior Vice President of the Home and Automotive Products division as well as the head of STP brands. He died in Hilton Head, South Carolina on August 13, 1996. The brand originally belonged to Union Carbide, but was divested in 1985 to First Brands Corporation (Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad, Simoniz, and Prestone) in the United States. In 1998, First Brands Corporation was acquired by Clorox. In 2002, Clorox allowed Procter & Gamble to buy a 10% share in Glad Products Company, thus making it a joint venture. Three years later, P&G; exercised its option under the agreement to increase its ownership to 20%, the maximum allowed under the joint venture agreement. Australian history Glad Wrap was invented in Australia by Union Carbide's research chemist, Douglas Lyons Ford, in the early 1960s, working in Union Carbide Australia's Rhodes plant in Sydney. The film was made from polyethylene with a stickifier added, produced as a continuous tube by the blown-film method, the tube then slit to make flat material that was put on rolls, and recently released in a newly designed \\"Easy Cut Dispenser\\". It was first introduced to the American market in 1963 in competition with Saran Wrap. Glad Wrap and Glad Bags were introduced in Australia in 1966; Glad was the first to introduce cling-type wrap to the Australian market. In order to promote the product, a competition was run in The Australian Women's Weekly asking readers to write in with suggested uses for the product. The winner of the competition was Lady Gwynnedd Casey, the wife of Lord Casey, the then Governor-General of Australia, who suggested it could be used to cover the hors d'ouvres before guests arrived at her garden party. Second prize went to a woman from western Sydney, who suggested it could be used to wrap up different kinds of buttons in her sewing kit to keep them separate from one another. Union Carbide purchased the Brisbane company, OSO, and in 1968, launched the OSO brand in competition with its own Glad brand. The OSO brand was made to be cheaper than, and inferior to, the Glad brand. In Australia, the Glad brand was acquired by Industrial Equity Limited in 1988, and then was floated as part of National Foods in 1991. In 1997, First Brands acquired the Glad brand from National Foods, thus consolidating worldwide ownership of the brand. Clorox took over ownership of Glad in Australia in 1998 as part of its acquisition of First Brands. The \\"Man from Glad\\" The Man from Glad is the Glad company's spokesman featured in many of their advertisements. He is an older gentleman with white hair and is always dressed in a white suit. In the 1960s, he was known as the \\"Man From Glad\\", and was summoned to various households in order to save housewives from their domestically challenged spouses. He wore a trenchcoat and would arrive in a wild variety of spy type contraptions (such as a jet pack or gyroglider), in the style of The Man from U.N.C.L.E and Mission: Impossible. He has been portrayed by several actors over the years, most famously Tom Bosley. The trash bags' slogans were \\"Why Take Chances, Get Glad!\\" and \\"Don't get mad! Get Glad!\\" Mardi Gras 2006 In 2006, following Hurricane Katrina, Glad became the first official sponsor of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. In addition to its significant program commitment, Glad worked with the City of New Orleans Department of Sanitation in the carnival's sanitation maintenance and clean-up efforts, which would otherwise have mounted a considerable expense for the municipality. Glad also was a major sponsor of the 2007 Mardi Gras. Year Of Glad In the novel Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace the final year of commercially subsidized time is referred to as the \\"Year Of Glad\\" in reference to the company. Additionally, James O. Incandenza, Sr. (whose son James O. Incandenza, Jr., and grandsons Orin, Mario, and Hal Incandenza are major characters) is mentioned as having played the Man from Glad in his time as an actor in the timeline of the book.

It was the 14th and most recent time overall that Chicago hosted the Republican National Convention, more times than any other city. The convention nominated Vice President Richard M. Nixon for president and former Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. of Massachusetts for vice president. The Presidency By the time the Republican convention opened, Nixon had no opponents for the nomination. The highlight of the convention was the speech by U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona removing himself from the race, in which he called on conservatives to \\"take back\\" the party. Nixon won easily, earning 1,321 votes to 10 for Goldwater. At the convention, Nixon promised that he would visit every state during his campaign. The Vice Presidency After winning the presidential nomination, Nixon considered several candidates for the vice presidential nomination. Incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower strongly supported Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Though Lodge was not viewed by Republicans as a charismatic speaker, his foreign policy experience made him an appealing candidate. Lodge was unpopular with the conservative wing of the party, who regarded him as a Northeastern moderate. As a result of the conservatives' coolness toward Lodge, Nixon strongly considered conservative Minnesota Representative Walter Judd and U.S. Senator Thruston Morton of Kentucky, an establishment Republican who was more moderate than Judd but had a high profile as chairman of the Republican National Committee. Other candidates Nixon considered include: * Robert B. Anderson, U.S. Treasury Secretary from Texas * Prescott S. Bush, U.S. Senator from Connecticut * Everett M. Dirksen, U.S. Senate Minority Leader from Illinois * Arthur S. Flemming, U.S. HEW Secretary from Ohio * Gerald R. Ford, U.S. Representative from Michigan (Would become Nixon's Vice President in the future) * Barry M. Goldwater, U.S. Senator from Arizona * Alfred M.

Stratton, Governor of Illinois * Philip Willkie, son of Wendell Willkie, the party's 1940 presidential candidate and member of the Indiana House of Representatives After deciding on Lodge, Nixon participated in a closed session with party leaders, who concurred with his preference. After the session, Nixon announced his choice publicly, and the convention ratified it. General election The Nixon-Lodge ticket lost the 1960 election to the Democratic ticket of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

Unsupervised visitation is the most common type, when the parent may take the child to his or her home or enjoy any outing with the child. In supervised visitation, another adult must be present, and there is sometimes a court order to occur at a predetermined supervised child contact centre. Virtual visitation uses video-conferencing technology to allow contact when a child lives far away from the parent. Concept In most jurisdictions the nature of a couple's relationship is established when a child is born to that relationship. In law, there may be differences in the consequences depending on whether the relationship is opposite-sex or same- sex, and whether it is in the form of a marriage, a civil union or registered partnership, or cohabitation without marriage. When one parent has sole custody of a child, there is usually court ordered contact/visitation with the non-custodial parent. The purpose is to ensure that the child can continue to maintain a relationship with both parents after divorce or separation, as well as in situations where the parents have never lived together. A common contact schedule is that the child spends every other weekend with the non-custodial parent, one weekday evening, certain holidays and a few weeks of summer vacation.See, e.g., Children are subject to the authority of their parents during the early years of their life, during what is termed their minority. States impose a range of incapacities until the children reach an age when they are deemed sufficiently mature to take responsibility for their own actions. Issues of access and custody interact and overlap, and represent all of the aspects of care and control that parents may exercise in relation to their children. The extent to which the courts have jurisdiction to regulate access will depend on the nature of the parents' relationship. In the event of the breakdown of the relationship between a minor child's parents, a court may define or modify a parent's access rights to the child within the context of proceedings for legal separation, annulment, divorce or child custody. Custody and access rights may be established in other manners, such as adoption or legal guardianship. In some cases a court may appoint a guardian ad litem appointed to represent any child's interests within the context of custody litigation.  Residential parent  Residential parent is that parent with whom the children are staying in the majority of the time. This term started to be used since the implementation of the joint custody since both parents have the custody of the child but, usually the child lives in the house of one of them the majority of his or her time.  Non-residential parent  The non-residential parent is that parent that has been granted with the child custody but only accommodates the child in their house for limited periods of time. Supervised visitation Under supervised visitation, another adult must be present during the contact hours. It is used to ensure the safety of the child while still allowing for a child-parent relationship. It may for example be used if there is a history of domestic violence, child abuse or child neglect, or, if the parent has a substance abuse problem or a mental illness. Supervised visitation may have no location restrictions, or, it may be ordered to occur at a specific child contact centre. Supervised visitation can be temporary in nature and changed to unsupervised visitation if, for example, the parent overcomes a substance abuse problem or completes anger management counseling.Custody X Change, Supervised Visitation Virtual visitation With virtual visitation, the child communicates with the parent through video conferencing, video mail, email or instant messages. It can be ordered by a court and it is often used when the child lives far away from a parent. It may also be used if a parent is in prison. Virtual visitation is meant to complement rather than to replace standard physical contact time.FindLaw, Virtual Visitation, 2019Lindsey Cramer, Margaret Goff, Bryce Peterson, Heather Sandstrom, Parent-Child VisitingPractices in Prisons and Jails: A Synthesis of Research and Practice, Urban Institute, April 2017. Policy background As a specific application of parens patriae (see public policy and the concept of best interests), most states treat the interests of any children caught up in litigation as their first and paramount concern. Usually, the children are not directly the parties to the lawsuit, so the courts have a range of options including the power to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect their interests. This is particularly important in cases involving the breakdown of any family relationship where questions relating to the welfare of the children will become significant in sometimes acrimonious disputes. At a supranational level, the Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasises the need to allow children a voice in any proceedings affecting their welfare. Significantly, it also suggests a change to the terminology, replacing \\"custody\\" and \\"access\\" with the concepts of \\"residence\\" and \\"contact\\". However, the most common legal outcome to cases involving the issues of care and control reinforces the sexual stereotype that a mother is always the better qualified person to care for younger children. Whereas some jurisdictions formally prefer joint custody arrangements in situations where there has previously been a stable family relationship, many states have a formalised rebuttable presumption in favour of the mother. European Union law The European Union has set up machinery for the mutual recognition of Family Law judgments through Council Regulation 2201/2003 which continues the harmonisation of the rules on jurisdiction and on the recognition and enforcement of all judgments on parental responsibility. The intention is to ensure that parental responsibility orders can be recognised and enforced through a uniform procedure. The courts in the Member State where the child is habitually resident have the primary jurisdiction to rule on parental responsibility. The courts in the other Member States shall enforce those judgments unless: *this infringes public policy in the given Member Statean extremely unlikely eventuality; *the child has not been given the opportunity to be heard except in cases of genuine urgency (in all cases, the fundamental right of every child to be heard and for his or her views to be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity, is provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which also states that the child's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all cases affecting their interests, whether initiated by public authorities or private institutions); *the person claiming that the judgment infringes his or her rights of parental responsibility has not been given an opportunity to be heard, or was not allowed a reasonable time to prepare his or her defense (see natural justice); and *the judgment is irreconcilable with a second subsisting judgment (under certain conditions). Following a proposal from the Commission in May 2002, a regulation on parental responsibility which was adopted on 27 November 2003 and applies from 1 March 2005: *ensures the right of the child to maintain contact with both parents even when the parents live in different Member States by allowing automatic recognition and enforcement of judgments on access rights, and *seeks to prevent parental child abduction within the Community. The courts of the Member State of the child's residence before abduction always have the jurisdiction. Some parents have abducted children to their own states in the hope of receiving more favourable treatment. The courts of the abducting parent's nationality can only refuse to return the child immediately if this is necessary: ::either because there is a grave risk that the child would be in danger if he or she returned, or ::if the child has attained a certain age and maturity and does not want to return. :But the court in the state where the child resided before the abduction takes the final decision as to where the child shall stay, and such decisions must be respected in the state of current residence. England Contact Orders are made under s8 Children Act 1989 to require the person(s) with whom a child lives to allow that child to visit, stay or have contact with a person named in the order. Orders continue until the child is 16 years. So long as the child is not under the care of a local authority, the following people can apply for a Contact Order: #the parent or guardian of a child (s10(4)(a)); #anyone who holds a Residence Order in respect of that child (s10(4)(b)); #a married stepparent of the child where the child lived with the stepparent as a child of the family (s10(5)(a)); #anyone with whom the child has lived for at least three years (this period need not have been continuous but must have been recent) (s10(5)(b)); #anyone who: :a) where there is already a Residence Order in place has the consent of every one who holds that order or :b) who has the consent of the local authority where the child is in their care or :c) has the consent of every one who has parental responsibility for the child. If an applicant cannot apply for the order as of right they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant the leave the court will consider under s10(9), amongst other things: #the nature of the application; #the applicant's connection with the child; #the risk there might be if the proposed application disrupting the child's life to such an extent that they should be harmed by it. Under s11, the court must attempt to avoid delay in making an Order. The court will only make contact orders for children over sixteen years old in exceptional circumstances. Contact can either be direct e.g. face-to-face meetings with a person or indirect e.g. by letter, video, exchange of greeting cards etc. Some orders will be very specific as to times, dates and arrangements for contact, other orders will be more open with detailed arrangements to be made between the parties by agreement. These orders are not just obtained by parents for contact with their children, there can also be orders for contact between siblings or the child and wider family members. Sometimes the order will give directions that the contact is to be supervised by a third person. The order may also only be for a specific period or contain provisions which operate for a specific period. These are Orders of the court and a failure to comply can be a contempt of court with serious consequences. Contact represents a change in fundamental concept to disputes involving the upbringing of children. Prior to The Children Act 1989 in the jurisdiction of England & Wales [and in Scotland in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995], an adult was usually granted 'access to' a child; now a child is to be allowed 'contact with an adult' [or stepbrother/sister]. Sixteen years after the Children Act 1989 became law, judges and the media in England still on occasion refer to 'custody and access' instead of 'residence and contact', and some judges are making orders such as 'father to have contact with the child' contrary to 'the child be allowed contact with father' as it argued by certain legal establishments the difference is minimal and in nomenclature only. The law is quiet clear that 'a residence order' undoubtedly gives additional rights to the residential parent, and does diminish the parental responsibility of the non-residential parent, in various ways. \`[b Hoggett]\`. Therefore, custody and residence, or contact and access can be in some circumstances be interchangeable concepts in family law. The argument that 'winner no longer takes all' in contact/residence access/custody disputes does not hold water. Japan In Japan, there is no legal guarantee of access by a noncustodial parent. Despite this, courts do often grant access rights to a noncustodial parent in the event of a divorce, or to the father of a child born out of wedlock, who by law is declared noncustodial by default. However, these court ordered visits are often only for several hours once a month, and in some cases, only once a year. Further, courts will not enforce these access provisions when the custodial parent is not co-operative. Several groups are working to change related laws and provide more detailed information on these laws and alternatives. United States Generally speaking, visitation is considered only a privilege granted to the non-custodial parent of any child of the family. The standard short-distance parenting plan by the family court in most U.S. states consists of alternating weekends and some holidays, there are also medium and long-distance parental plans that allow to combine these visits into a longer stretches of time to reduce traveling. Parents normally can make variations to the state standard parenting plan or develop a different custom plan if judge approve the changes. In most of the states there is a law required that court-ordered parenting plans must set forth the minimum amount of parenting time and access a noncustodial parent is entitled to have. However, the child, at or around the age of 13, depending on the state, may have a right to testify in court about custody and parenting plan arrangements that may have a big impact on court decision. Parents (and in most States Grandparents) frequently believe that they have \\"a right\\" to visitation or access. However, when custodial parental interference with visitation occurs, civil courts in the U.S. do not enforce their own court orders. Usually citing, \\"best interests of the child\\" and reasoning punishment of the custodial parent to enforce the visitation order would further harm the child(ren) in question. Some States are looking at changing that by making visitation interference a criminal offence. Most noncustodial parents have visitation orders that allow the child to visit with them without any supervision, away from the custodial residence. But sometimes when there are safety problems or child abuse history, the court can set up a supervised or \\"safety-focused\\" parenting plan. Also, court can order the visitation to be supervised by a social worker, parenting coordinator, guardian ad litem, or other third party while the noncustodial parent visits with the child. This is called supervised visitation. Parents may also agree share custody and agree to allow visitation without of going to court. In these situations, so it is seem like a court order may not be needed, it should be obtained to forestall later disputes about what the parents had previously agreed to, and to allow the courts to have some oversight over the children (which they normally have under statute and under the parens patriae power). If the parenting plan agreed by parties before the court hearing, it is called \\"stipulated\\". Judge can approve the stipulated parenting plan without of any court hearing. Judges are normally encourage parties to reach the agreement, rather than go to hearing. By statistic, most family law cases (90‚Äì95%) settle before the judge rules on them. In 27 states, a rapist who got their victim pregnant, can legally sue for visitation, and in some cases even custody.

It was designed and built by New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1924 to 1925. It is also known as Lithgow Railway Station Group and Residence and Eskbank East. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013. The station has frequent NSW TrainLink services running to and from Sydney Central. History The first Lithgow station. With the completion of the Lithgow Zig Zag in 1869, the Western railway's terminus moved from to Bowenfels, signifying the successful crossing of the Blue Mountains. Whilst the railway would continue west, Lithgow proved to be an important destination in itself due to coal and iron ore deposits. The line opened in 1869 but there was no station for Lithgow until 1877. The first station at Lithgow was located east of the present site in June 1877. The former 1877 railway platform is still extant. The line was duplicated in 1880.AM consulting, 2014, 2. In the first half of the 1920s, it was decided to expand Lithgow as a regional headquarters for the NSW Railways. Apart from the new large locomotive depot, the Railways selected a new site west of Eskbank station for the development of a new passenger station to replace Eskbank Station, which remains but is unused. Like most stations between Emu Plains and Lithgow, Lithgow received a standard Federation style set of two platform structures, a main face brick building and a detached brick \\"out-of\\" shed. There was also a footwarmer shed on the western end of the platform. The new station site featured two new buildings, both opened on 9 March 1925.Lithgow Station NSWrail.net The first was a timber booking and parcels office elevated on a steel beam frame with a concrete deck that was located adjacent to Eskbank Street. Access from this entry point was by a ramp and stepway to the island platform. One unusual feature was the installation of a lift for staff use only to handle baggage, parcels and \\"out- ofs\\". It is assumed that the dry stone retaining wall is associated with the adjacent remnant concrete pedestrian ramp and therefore the original construction of the railway station. A two-storey face brick office building for train controller and western communications was constructed at 12 Railway Parade at the corner of Railway Parade and Eskbank Street in 1954-56, and is still in use in 2009. In 1957 the line was electrified through Lithgow to Bowenfels, but Lithgow is the present limit of electric operations. In 1961, the last traditional Railway Refreshment Room was built and opened in the Sydney end of the building, following the closure of a similar facility at Mount Victoria. The refreshment room closed in July 1990, being the last example in the state. The station exit was originally located on the footbridge at the eastern end of the platform until replaced by the present concourse in August 1991. The overhead station offices and footbridge were constructed in and access has been relocated to the western end of the station.  Description =Landscape features The setting of the station within a relatively steep rock cutting provides a distinctive landscape presentation to Lithgow Railway Station. The northern embankment has been sealed with shotcrete and the same material has been used part way along the southern embankment. The exposed embankment surface is a friable composition of shale, rubble and soils. Removal of vegetation has revealed a dry stone wall of roughly shaped sandstone blocks set near to the top of the southern embankment, extending from the overhead footbridge for approximately with a height ranging form to the concrete ramp. Proximity to the ramp indicates the wall is an integral element of the original station construction. A \\"path\\" or bed for the concrete ramp runs across the embankment in front of the wall.AM consulting, 2014, 3. Apart from a couple of garden beds with shrubs (clipped into spheres and rounded shapes) and small planting of annuals (traditionally) and hardy soft-wooded perennials (again, tightly clipped into shapes)Longworth, 2012, 4. along the eastern portion of the island platform there is no other landscaping at the station. The existing landscaping is not considered significant but contributes to the setting and character of the place and continues a tradition of railway gardening on this site for some time. Structures and buildings The heritage-listed complex comprises: *Island platform - brick faced (1925) *Old Station Platform - levelled rock face (1877) *Eskbank Street Overbridge (1924) *Station Building - type 11, island building, brick (1925) *Former Booking/Parcels office & Goods lift tower - timber (1925) *Station Master's residence - 6 Railway Parade (c.1880) *Hayley Street Footbridge and Overhead Booking Office (1993) =Island platform, erect 1925= Lithgow station is a typical island platform, curving slightly along the Up end. The platform is brick faced with concrete deck and asphalt finish. Modern light fittings, illuminated signage, timber bench seating, small planters, and a central garden bed (which appears to be the former location of the access ramp/stairs from Eskbank Street) comprise the platform furnishings. The platform is set within the rock cutting lower than the adjoining street levels and accessed from the western end via concrete stairs and U-shaped tube-like ramps leading to the footbridge linking the station to both Railway Parade and Main Street. A contemporary canopy provides weather protection between the station building and the footbridge through the stairs. =Hayley Street Footbridge and booking office, erected 1993= The Hayley Street Footbridge is a modern concrete deck footbridge suspended over steel beam and trestles over the station platform and the railway tracks to both side streets leading to the bus interchange on Railway Parade. It has a simple arrangement with the Station Master's office and the booking office on the northern half featuring a gabled corrugated metal roof with a small series of skylights. The remainder of the footbridge is covered with the same roof with no skylights and features steel pipe-rail balustrades with glazed enclosures. It is linked to the platform by the tube-like ramp and the stairs. A lift tower is located at the ramp entrance of the footbridge. The footbridge, overhead booking office and Station Master's office are typical of modern structures with simple detailing and no architectural merit. Excluded from listing. =Old Station platform, erected 1877= This former platform is evidence of the first Lithgow Station and is a levelled railway platform over the rock cutting. It is located further to the west of the present station at the southern foundation of the Sandford Avenue overbridge. Access to the redundant platform was not available for close inspection. The former station building no longer exists. =Esbank Street over bridge, erected = Two rendered segmental arch spandrels with rock cliff abutments on both sides of the former overhead booking/parcels office structure. =Station building, erected 1925 and extended 1961= External: Constructed of face brick with a corrugated metal gabled roof extending as an awning to both platforms, the Lithgow station building is an island platform building in standard \\"A10\\" Federation style design. It features ten bays with a linear arrangement along the platform with tuckpointed brickwork and engaged piers between the bays. The eastern (Up) end of the building has been extended approximately one bay in 1961 (formerly used as Railway Refreshment Room) with a matching gable end detailing featuring large metal box-framed window openings supported on with brick brackets with security mesh and a single door with side windows and fanlight on the east side. A narrow awning provides protection over this door. Other features to the original bays of the building include standard iron brackets over decorative corbels supporting the ample platform awnings, fretted timber work to both ends of the awnings, timber framed double-hung vertically proportioned windows with multi-paned upper sashes, timber panelled doors with multi-paned fanlights, and a brick chimney with corbelled top and modern roof vents to toilets. The wall mounted clock on No.1 platform next to the Station Master's office appears original. Windows on the platform elevations of the two most eastern bays have been enlarged and covered by security mesh or grills. Another single door with windows on each side is also located on the west end of the building and provides access to the gent's toilets. There is a modern canopy extension at the western end of the station building, where the new platform canopy extends from the footbridge stairs access to the station. Internal: Although the station building generally appears intact externally its internal room layouts and divisions have been modified. The original floor layout included (from west to east) an SM's office, telegraph office, general waiting room, ladies room & lavatory, store and gent's room. The current floor layout consists of a locked room, SM's office, waiting room, ladies toilets, staff meal room and gent's toilets. Apart from the toilets and the waiting room the rest of the rooms are kept locked. The interiors have been refurbished with only plasterboard ceiling panelling, simple moulded cornices and high wall vents appear to remain from the original phase. The floors are tiled. =Former book / Parcels office and goods lift tower, erected in 1925= External: The former booking office is located on the western side of the Eskbank Street overhead bridge at the Up end of the station. Constructed of timber with weatherboard cladding the building is now partially utilised as ladies waiting room and public toilets. It is elevated on a steel beam and trestles structure with concrete deck and adjoins the arched road overbridge on the eastern side. The former booking/parcels office also adjoins the timber goods lift tower on the north side. The street elevation of the building has been faced with a brick wall and a flat awning along the street frontage. A timber panelled balustrade with artwork reflecting a coal mining theme completes the remaining portion of the overhead bridge on the north side of the tower. The door and windows on the street elevations are of later modifications with metal frames and security mesh. The large gates to the former parcels office and the goods lift have been blocked with metal panels. Original timber framed double-hung windows with multi-paned upper sashes are located on north, east and western elevations of the booking/parcels office. A shallow pitched gabled red corrugated iron roof covers the building. The timber goods lift tower is the dominant element of the former booking/parcels office building and has a hipped corrugated metal roof. The goods lift is not in operation, and it is not clear if the original lift survives. However; existence of few safety signs indicates possible uses for maintenance or similar activities. The timber tower extends down onto the platform with a timber panelled out-of-shed building on the platform. The southern leg of the steel trestles sits within the out-of-shed. Internal: Access only was available to the open ladies waiting room and toilets. The interiors of this former booking office are simple with plasterboard wall and ceiling panelling decorated with plain timber rail at lintel height and timber skirting. Floors are tiled. The original ticket window survives. =Station Master's residence, erected = External: Located at 6 Railway Parade to the eastern side of Lithgow Station, the Station Master's residence is a fine example of a grand two-storey railway residence. It is constructed of brick and stone, with rusticated render to the main railway facades and a slate tiled roof. The residence is located on the northern side of the railway line with a projecting faceted observatory room over the entrance portico. The distinctive Victorian features include arched windows with contrasting rendered moulded trims and sills, projecting keystones, rendered contrasting string band at the first floor slab level, decorative moulded brackets supporting the wide eaves, a rendered chimney with corbelled top, timber framed double-hung windows with two-pane upper sashes, timber panelled entrance door with sidelights and fanlight, and an arched two- storey high decorative portico with tessellated tile flooring over the front entry dominating the railway facade. A highly decorated drawing room bay on the ground floor level dominates the Sydney side elevation of the building and features a series of segmental arched tall windows with moulded sill course and label panels below the sill, pitched slate roof with lead capping and flashing, decorative moulded brackets supporting the awning, and moulded trims and keystones to the arches. Access to the residence is via a porch from the face brick two-storey wing on the Railway Parade elevation. A later skillion roof utility room addition is located on the western side of the residence. The orientation of the building's openings including the architectural detailing and embellishment provide evidence of the close relationship between the Station Master's residence and the Station as well as the importance given to the railway staff at the time. Internal: The former Station Master's residence is still in use as guest accommodation and generally maintains its original layout and detailing despite the refurbishments over time. The main original features include timber board ceiling lining to the refurbished kitchen, timber moulded architraves throughout, decorative high wall vents, timber panelled ceilings with decorative ceiling roses to main ground floor rooms and upper floor bedrooms, an original light switch, timber decorative stair with turned balustrade and newel post, and fireplaces with simple timber surrounds. There is only one fireplace with a cast iron grate, the remainder of the fireplaces having been blocked. The kitchen features an old style Bega brand stove in the fireplace. The bathrooms and kitchen are relatively new fit-outs while the floor finishes are generally carpet to the rooms and tile to the wet areas. A small laundry and a toilet are located in the later skillion addition. =Moveable items= The following moveable items have been observed at Lithgow Railway Station Group: * A Seth Thomas clock at overhead Station Master's office (no number). * Wall mounted clock on Platform 1 elevation of the Station Building next to the former Station Master's office door. * Various early timber station signs depicting the station building room and platform names. * Old Bega brand stove in the kitchen of the SM's residence. * Early light switch on the upstairs main bedroom of the SM's residence. =Potential archaeological features= The former 1877 railway platform of the first Lithgow Station is the only known potential archaeological element at the Lithgow Railway Station Group.  Condition  As at 25 August 2009, the station building is in generally in good condition with minimal missing mortar joints that present no structural danger. The former Booking/Parcels office & Goods lift tower is in generally in moderate condition. Rising damp and rotten timber evident at the platform base of the out-of-shed and the lift tower. External repainting is required in near future. Internal spaces could not be inspected. The Station Master's Residence is in generally in good condition externally with cracks on the rusticated render along bottom portion of the railway elevation. However, this is not considered as a structural issue. Natural wear and tear throughout the exterior evident. Internally the residence is in very good condition. The island platform is in good condition. The Hayley Street Footbridge is in very good condition. Access was not available for close inspection of the Old Station platform, however appears to be in moderate condition due to overgrown grassed environment. The overall integrity of the Railway Station Group including the station building, the residence, and the overhead booking /parcels office and goods lift tower is high. The buildings are relatively intact externally.  Modifications and dates  *Externally, the main platform building appears as it was constructed with additional bay on the Up end. *1929an awning was erected over the footpath of Eskbank Street. *1948the overhead booking office on Eskbank Street was extended. *1977Office Building - air-condition units installed to the district engineer's, officer and clerk offices. *1983the Eskbank Street booking office was modernised. *199 a new \\"bus/rail interchange\\" was erected at the western end of the platform with the footbridge over tracks. The Eskbank Street access ramp was closed and a new booking office was opened on the footbridge. *1994/95a lift was installed at the new ramp. *N.d.The former brick subtype 1 through shed (goods shed) could not be located and appears to have since been demolished. *N.d.Foot warmer and out-of-shed removed.  Further information  The Lithgow Coal Stage Signal Box, Eskbank Railway Station, and Lithgow (James Street) Underbridge all have separate listings. The following items are located adjacent to the station but are excluded from the listing as they do not warrant listing on the SHR: *Substation - rectangular single-storey substation of face brick construction featuring strongly emphasized engaged piers with decorative projecting accent, a four course brick base with a recessed course and bullnosed splay on top, a parapet with capping extending above the piers, and a metal door with bullnosed brick surrounds. The rear of the substation appears to be damaged in part with paint finish on the wall possibly to obscure some graffiti. *Office Building - large two-storey office building of face brick construction. It is located to the west of the Station Master's residence at the corner of Railway Parade and Eskbank Street. The building combines three adjacent wings, one of which has a higher sill level to the upper storey windows resulting in a higher eaves and ridge level than the other wings. They form a stepped complex building. The overall fenestration of the building is typical of post-war period office building fa√ßade articulation featuring large 12-pane metal windows with three casement windows, with dominant mullions emphasised. A rendered string course forms a hood along the lintel height of the ground floor and is the only decorative element on the main fa√ßade that provides continuity between the wings beside the windows. The main office block entry is from the eastern smallest wing via a recessed porch with large multi-paned floor to ceiling glazing and a single door opening. Three doors with a utilitarian appearance (one to the main large building and the others in group to the central wing) provide separate access to the individual wings. The roof is hipped with terracotta tiles. A single flight later addition steel fire stair is attached to the west elevation of the large wing, which required creation of a new door opening on the upper level elevation. These are the only visible major modifications to the exterior of the building. Security grills to ground floor doors and obscure glazing to some windows are the other minor changes. Platforms and services Lithgow has one island platform with two sides. It is the terminating point for NSW TrainLink Blue Mountains Line services from Sydney Central. It is also served by the Bathurst Bullet to Bathurst, the Central West XPT to Dubbo and the Outback Xplorer to Broken Hill. Great Southern Rail's Indian Pacific passes Lithgow but does not stop at the station. Transport links Lithgow Buslines operate six routes to and from Lithgow station: *100: to Lithgow Hospital *200: to Bowenfels *304: to Oakey Park & McKellars Park *500: to Vale of Clwydd *600: to Portland *636: to Bathurst NSW TrainLink operate road coach services from Lithgow to Orange, Grenfell, Parkes, Dubbo, Nyngan, Gulgong, Coonabarabran and Baradine.  Heritage listing  As at 10 December 2009, Lithgow Railway Station is significant as an important regional headquarters for the NSW Railways since the 1920s combining a range of buildings and structures dating from the 1880s to the mid-1920s and is significant for its strong associations with the rail and coal industry in the wider Lithgow and Eskbank area. Along with nearby Eskbank Station, the site provides physical evidence of the activities and development that occurred in the historic Lithgow railway corridor marking several important phases in the evolution of railway operations in the most western end of the upper Blue Mountains. The buildings reflect the development of the site, the shift of the station location and the development of the town as a major mining area in the early years of the century. Lithgow Railway Station is of aesthetic significance as it comprises a number of buildings that are individually good examples of their type. The platform building is a good example of a standard island building demonstrating the typical characteristics of Federation railway architecture used throughout NSW. The weatherboard overhead booking and parcels office and the goods lift tower display both aesthetic and technical achievements in design and construction. The Station Master's residence is a fine example of a grand two-storey railway residence with a prominent and landmark quality overlooking the railway corridor. Its distinctive architectural detailing and fenestration is evidence of prosperity in the railways and the importance given to the railway staff in the 1880s. Lithgow railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lithgow Railway Station Group is of historical significance for its role as an important regional headquarters for NSW Railways combining a range of buildings and structures dating from the 1880s to the mid-1920s and for its association with the rail history and the coal industry in the Lithgow and Eskbank area. The site provides physical evidence of the activities and development that occurred in Lithgow railway historic precinct and marks an important phase in the evolution of railway operations in the most western end of the upper Blue Mountains and the Metro West railway region. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Lithgow Railway Station Group is of aesthetic significance as it comprises a number of buildings that are individually good examples of their type. The station building is a good example of the standard island building style with a sympathetic addition to one end and features typical characteristics elements of the Federation design railway building. The weatherboard overhead booking and parcels office building and the goods lift tower display both aesthetic and technical achievements in design and construction. Although it is unclear it appears that the original lift may still be in use. The Station Master's residence is a fine example of a grand two-storey railway residence with a prominent and landmark quality overlooking the railway corridor. Its distinctive architectural detailing and fenestration is evidence of prosperity in the railways and the importance given to the railway staff in the 1880s. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lithgow Railway Station Group has research potential at local level due to its relatively intact complex of buildings that generally maintain their original relationship and layout. The group also has the ability to provide valuable information on railway design for the local coal industry as part of the larger rail network. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Lithgow Railway Station Group comprises a rare goods lift tower from the street down to the platform. The 1925 goods lift tower is a unique arrangement and possibly the first example of providing this form of platform access in the railway network. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Station Group as a whole is a representative example of a larger station design incorporating standard design buildings and structures associated with the coal industry goods traffic that is still an important railway activity in the region.

Media multitasking has been associated with depressive symptoms and social anxiety by a single study involving 318 participants. A 2018 review found that while the literature is sparse and inconclusive, people who do a heavy amount of media multitasking have poorer performance in several cognitive domains. One of the authors commented that while the data does not \\"unambiguously show that media multitasking causes a change in attention and memory,\\" media multitasking is an inefficient practice that requires \\"task switching\\" costs. In many cases, media multitasking is made up of experiences that are not necessarily intended to be combined or coordinated. For example, a user may be browsing the Web, listening to music, playing video games, using e-mail, and/or talking on the phone while watching TV. More intentionally coordinated forms of media multitasking are emerging in the form of \\"co-active media\\" and particularly \\"co-active TV\\". Cognitive distraction A touchstone 2009 study by Stanford University used experiments to compare heavy media multitaskers to light media multitaskers in terms of their cognitive control and ability to process information. Findings from the experiment include: # When intentionally distracting elements were added to experiments, heavy media multitaskers were on average 77 milliseconds slower than their lighter media multitasking counterparts at identifying changes in patterns; # In a longer- term memory test that invited participants to recall specific elements from earlier experiments, the high multitaskers more often falsely identified the elements that had been used most frequently as intentional distractors; # In the presence of distracting elements, high multitaskers were 426 milliseconds slower than their counterparts to switch to new activities and 259 milliseconds slower to engage in a new section of the same activity. The researchers conclude that the experiments \\"suggest that heavy media [multitaskers] are distracted by the multiple streams of media they are consuming, or alternatively, that those who infrequently multitask are more effective at volitionally allocating their attention in the face of distractions.\\" In the \\"bottleneck theory\\" of cognitive performance, the slowing down seen when people multitask is called \\"interference.\\" According to this theory, people have only a limited amount of cognitive resources, which allow us to focus and complete one task at a time. When we try to do several things at once or multitask, our performance suffers a slowdown because of a \\"cognitive bottleneck,\\" which is similar to a traffic jam in the brain. Researchers tried to disprove this theory over several decades, and although they found a handful of activities that people can do simultaneously without slowing, these activities are relatively simple and so far removed from everyday human activities‚Äîthat they cannot be used as support for people's ability to multitask. A team of researchers reviewed the extensive literature on multitasking and concluded that hundreds of studies show that slowing will happen when people try to multitask; in fact, many studies that were designed to show that people could multitask without interference in fact indicated the opposite. These researchers warned that when people attempt to multitask, especially when doing complex and potentially dangerous tasks (such as driving and using their cell phones to talk or text), they will always encounter the cognitive bottleneck, causing their performance to suffer in terms of speed or accuracy. A related article, \\"Breadth-biased versus focused cognitive control in media multitasking behaviors,\\" notes that the prevalence of this phenomenon leads \\"to a question about the required skills and expertise to function in society. A society with its ever-increasing complexity appears to move people towards juggling among multiple tasks rather than focusing on one task for a long period.\\" The study's author suggests that further research will be necessary as the effects on society become more pronounced: \\"The new technologies are gearing people, especially young people who grow up with digital technologies and wired networks, toward breadth-biased information processing behavior rather than linear in-depth study behavior. Long-term exposure to media multitasking is expected to produce both positive and negative outcomes on cognitive, emotional, and social development.\\" By generation Despite the research, people from younger generations report that they feel multitasking is easy, even \\"a way of life.\\" They perceive themselves as good at it and spend a substantial amount of their time engaged in one form of multitasking or another (for example, watching TV while doing homework, listening to music while doing homework, or even all three things at once). By contrast, members of older generations often openly admit that they are not very good at multitasking, finding it difficult, and therefore, do not do it as often as young people. In the workforce Multitasking behavior in the workforce has been increasing steadily since the 1990s as people have easier, and therefore faster, access to information and communication through smart technologies that have become cheaper over time. Although multitasking behavior harms performance, the paradox is that organizational productivity is increasing at a high rate nonetheless. Concurrent with increased multitasking in the workforce and the subsequent rise in productivity and multitasking in general, literature has witnessed progressively more reports of increased stress, loss of focus, symptoms resembling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and even a lowering of IQ.Freedman, D.

While driving Research in media multitasking in real-world settings focused mostly on using cellphones while driving. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence to show that talking on a phone while driving is very dangerous, often leading to crashes, including those fatal to both drivers and pedestrians. Just one hour of talking on a cellphone per month while driving makes a person between four and nine times more likely to crash. Meanwhile, people who text while driving are 23 times more likely to be involved in some kind of accident.Olson, R. L., Hanowski, R. J., Hickman, J. S., & Bocanegra, J. (2009). Driver Distraction in Commercial Vehicle Operations. U.S. Department of Transportation, 146. A large review of studies on driving while media multitasking showed that using a hands-free phone while driving is just as dangerous as using a hand-held version, and that both can result in many different driving mistakes including missing stop signs, forgetting to reduce speed when necessary, and following too closely, among many others. Also, media multitasking while driving with other technologies, including MP3 players, voice-based email, a car's music system, and even the GPS, is just as distracting as using a phone. Talking to a person on a cellphone while driving is not the same as having a conversation with a passenger, as adult passengers (but not children) often warn the driver of possible dangers, or at least stop talking when the driving conditions are tough, to let the driver focus on the road. Learning Students commonly use multiple portable digital technologies, including laptops, tablets and smartphones with wireless access to the Internet. Students can use technologies in the classroom to multi-task in two specific ways when given the choice: For on-task purposes that supplement learning and ease the learning task, or for off-task purposes such as entertainment or social interaction. Overall, research shows that digital technologies can enhance learning when used as educational tools, as they are affordable and extremely portable. However, research consistently shows that inappropriate multitasking with digital technologies is harmful to student performance. On-task multitasking Students use technology for many diverse on-task purposes including taking notes, conducting literature searches, viewing video/audio files, creating and viewing spreadsheets and PowerPoint slides, completing online tests and assignments, and even texting friends to ask questions about course material. Outside of the classroom, students frequently use technology such as instant messaging to communicate with other students, coordinate group work, share important files and homework, and form peer support groups to vent and improve motivation. Students in grade school and high school benefit most from on-task use of technology. This is largely because at the grade school and high school levels, technology is integrated into the design of the course, and teachers provide the necessary structure and supervision. Such conditions allow students to process information more deeply and apply the newly learned information to new contexts, as well as improve collaboration among students. However, university students do not generally benefit from technology. The results of one study showed no benefits to using laptops for improving student GPA (grade point average) in comparison to students who did not use laptops. Two further studies showed that students who did not use laptops outperformed those who did use laptops.Martin, L. R. (2011). Teaching business statistics and a computer lab: Benefit or distraction? Journal of Education for Business, 86, 326‚Äì331. DOI: 10. 1080/08832323. 2010. 529958 Overall, there is a pattern of decreasing the effectiveness of using technology for on-task purposes from the grade school level to the university level. This appears to be due to increased freedom of use of technology, combined with lower levels of integration of specific technology in the design of specific course material. Additionally, younger students and students from financially disadvantages backgrounds who have high levels of Internet use are at an especially high risk of under-performing. Off-task multitasking A large portion of students use digital technologies for off-task purposes during classroom lectures, with social networking (especially Facebook), instant messaging, texting, emailing, and web-browsing being used most commonlyZivcakova, L., & Wood, E. (2012). Students' natural use of technologies during a real-time classroom lecture. Athens: ATINER'S Conference Paper Series, No: SOC2012-0066. Moreover, young adults multitask more than older adults and males multitask more than females for off-task purposes. The results of numerous studies show that high Internet use for off-task purposes is associated with lower GPA. One experimental study compared the impact of using 4 different technologies for off-task purposes including MSN, email, texting, and Facebook, to three control groups during real classroom lectures. The three control groups included one group of students who were free to use any amount of technologies as they wished including any on-task or off-task purposes. The other two groups were on-task note-takers who took notes either on paper, or on a laptop. The results showed that students in the MSN and Facebook conditions scored lower on a memory test than the paper notes control group. When examining the amount of multitasking instead of specific technologies, the results showed that greater levels of multitasking led to progressively lower grades. While all studies show that any kind of off-task multitasking lowers performance, some tasks impair performance more than others. Specifically, social networking is particularly bad for student performance as it leads to higher levels of unfinished assignments and lower GPAs. Moreover, off-task multitasking distracts not only the user but also neighboring students. Student multitasking An observational study of how students study at home examined their study habits and strategies. The results showed that most students prefer to task-switch a lot and focus for only approximately 6 minutes before reaching for their favorite digital device. Moreover, the students who enjoyed task-switching did so more often and with more technologies in comparison to students who preferred to focus on a single learning task, and who therefore did not have as many technologies readily available. Consistent with previous studies, students with a preference for focusing and those who used proper study strategies had higher GPAs than students who preferred to task-switch. Karpinski and colleagues (2013) compared multitasking behaviors of students from Europe to those of students from the U.S. They found that only the students from the U.S. were distracted by multitasking to the point that their GPA suffered. This was due to two main reasons: the U.S. students multitask more than European students and the European students, when engaging in multitasking, were more strategic in their multitasking behavior as they delayed replying to incoming messages. The concept of \\"digital meta cognition\\"‚Äîawareness of one's usage of and the effects of digital devices‚Äîhas been proposed as a construct for providing a way to avoid problems with media multitasking while learning.

They are so called because they have a direct life cycle which requires no intermediate hosts or vectors, and the parasitic infection occurs through faecal contamination of soil, foodstuffs and water supplies. The adult forms are essentially parasites of humans, causing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), but also infect domesticated mammals. The juveniles are the infective forms and they undergo tissue- migratory stages during which they invade vital organs such as lungs and liver. Thus the disease manifestations can be both local and systemic. The geohelminths together present an enormous infection burden on humanity, amounting to 135,000 deaths every year, and persistent infection of more than two billion people. Types Soil-transmitted helminths are typically from the following families of nematodes, namely: *Roundworms (family Ascarididae), e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides *Whipworms (family Trichuridae), e.g. Trichuris trichiura *Hookworms (family Ancylostomatidae), e.g. Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus *Threadworms (family Strongyloididae), e.g. Strongyloides stercoralis)In the UK and Australia, however, the term threadworm can also refer to nematodes of the genus Enterobius, otherwise known as pinworms. Vide Diseases=Soil-transmitted helminthiasis Soil-transmitted helminthiasis is a collective name for the diseases caused by ascaris, whipworm and hookworms in humans. It includes species-specific diseases such as *Ascariasis, which is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides *Hookworm diseases (ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis), which are caused by Necator americanus and Ascaris duodenale *Trichuriasis, which is caused by Trichuris trichiura Soil- transmitted helminthiasis is classified as one of the neglected tropical diseases projected to be controlled/eradicated by 2020 through the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. =Strongyloidiasis= This is caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. Even though the disease is principally a soil-transmitted helminthiasis, the infection being mediated through contaminated soil, it is however generally omitted in clinical practices and control programmes because of its (allegedly) relatively less significant influence on health and socio-economic conditions. Also it is not restricted to humans, as it is common in pets. But there is an emerging hyperinfection syndrome caused by S. stercoralis, which exhibits a high mortality rate (15% to 87%). General impact Geohelminth infection is a major health problem particularly in rural areas of developing countries like Subsaharan Africa, India and other Southeast Asian countries. It is an important cause of morbidity in school age children who harbour the highest intensity of worm infestation. Some of the significant morbidity attributed to intestinal helminthiasis are malnutrition, growth retardation, anaemia, vitamin A deficiency and impaired intellectual performance.

Hancock imported breeding stock from Europe that made Claiborne Farm an international leader in breeding, sales, and racing. He bred Vigil, the 1923 Preakness Stakes winner. Among his famous sires was Sir Gallahad, purchased from France, who was the leading sire in 1930, 1933, 1934, and 1940 and who sired 1930 U.S. Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox. Claiborne Farm was part of a 1936 consortium that imported Blenheim from England and in 1944 purchased Princequillo, who became the leading U.S. sire for 1957 and 1958. Claiborne Farm won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1979 and again in 1984. It has been visited twice by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who owns racehorses herself. The farm was home to all the major horses owned by the Phipps family, including Orb, the 2013 Kentucky Derby winner. Secretariat was syndicated by Seth Hancock for breeding purposes and stood at stud at Claiborne Farm from the conclusion of his racing career at the end of 1973 until his death in 1989.

House Energy Rating 5-star logo The Australian Building Codes Board introduced energy efficiency measures for houses into the Building Code of Australia (BCA) on 1 January 2003. It has been adopted by all Australian states and territories which did not already have an equivalent system in place. Victoria and South Australia have gone beyond the standard, and mandated, instead of 4-stars, a 5-star rating (enacted July 2004) ‚Äì all new homes and apartments built in Victoria must since 2010 comply with the 6 Star standard. This means it is compulsory for new houses to have: * 6 Star energy rating for the building fabric, and * A rainwater tank for toilet flushing or a solar hot water system, and * Water efficient shower heads and tapware. During 2006, requirements for 5-star energy ratings were introduced for new homes through the BCA in Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. As of mid-2007 Tasmania and the Northern Territory have not adopted 5 star requirements for new homes. As of 2010, Queensland has adopted 6-star requirements for new homes.http://www.map-testing.com/content/info/menu/map- testing-protocol.html New South Wales has not adopted requirements under the BCA and operates its own Building Sustainability Index or BASIX. Victorian consumers and building practitioners can find out more about the 5-Star energy ratings by visiting Make Your Home Green ‚Äì Building Commission  Ratings  ACT, by star rating. See image page for details. 6-Star rating A 6-Star rating indicates that a building achieves a higher level of thermal energy performance than, say a 5 star rating. As of November 2011, 6-Star equivalence is the current minimum requirement in most of Australia. 5-Star rating A 5-Star rating indicates that a building achieves a high level of thermal energy performance, and will require minimum levels of heating and cooling to be comfortable in winter and summer. Houses which achieve a 5 star rating, compared to the average 2 star home, should be more comfortable to live in, have lower energy bills, and costs to install heating and cooling equipment should also be lower. Energy assessments take into account different climatic conditions in different parts of the country and are benchmarked according to average household energy consumption particular to a given climatic region. The house energy rating does not currently include the efficiency of any appliances fitted or used within the house. There are also no physical testing requirements, so air tightness testing is not required as it is with the regulations in the UK. State Government initiatives * ACT House Energy Rating Scheme (ACTHERS), requires new or previously lived in residential homes to have an Energy Efficiency Rating (EER) Statement, prepared by an accredited ACTHERS assessor, if they are to be sold. As of the February 2006, the required software used in assessment is FirstRate, Version 3.1 or Version 4.http://www.planning.act.gov.au/topics/design-and- build/design-and-siting/energy_ratings * In Victoria all new homes built since 2005 are required to achieve a 5 Star rating. Rating can be performed using any software approved by NatHERS. * In South Australia, all new homes (and alterations to existing homes) are required to achieve a 6 star rating. This requirement was introduced on 1 September 2010. * Western Australia: in 2007 the WA Government introduced further energy and water usage regulatory requirements. 5 Star Plus consists of two codes: the Energy Use in Houses Code, which requires a minimum standard of energy performance for a hot water system; and the Water Use in Houses Code, which includes provisions for alternative water supplies, efficient fixtures and fittings, and grey water diversion. * In Queensland it is proposed that from either 1 January 2009, or when the Building Code of Australia 2009 update is released in May 2009, that all new homes built in Queensland will be required to achieve a 5 star energy equivalent rating. Currently the minimum requirement is 3.5 stars. Software AccuRate screenshot (demo version). One of the best ways to achieve an energy rating on a proposed house is by using House Energy Rating Software (HERS). This kind of software will simulate a home and provide estimates for the energy needed to heat and cool that home over the course of the year. The Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) is a framework by which this kind of software is assessed, compared and accredited for use in Australia. The First Generation of accreditation included the FirstRate 4, BERS 3.2 and NatHERS software packages, allowing accredited assessor to use this software to provide energy ratings. The Second Generation of accreditation was tightened and improved, meaning that software had to become more precise, accurate and powerful in response. The Second Generation of software must take into account more features and realistically model elements such as natural ventilation, the cooling effects of ceiling fans, under-floor heating and the effects of attached dwellings such as apartments. The First Generation has been phased out for the Second Generation of software to take over. In Victoria, the First Generation of software was no longer acceptable for energy ratings after 30 April 2009. FirstRate is the software package developed by Sustainability Victoria. Over the course of 2008, Sustainability Victoria has produced a new version, FirstRate 5. FirstRate 5 received provisional Second Generation accreditation on 31 August 2007. This means that it can be used for house energy ratings now. From May 2009, it will be the only version of FirstRate accredited for use in Victoria. FirstRate Five uses the AccuRate calculation engine with a graphic interface. It includes: the ability to zone the house according to how each room will be used, the ability to rate up to 10 stars and the full range of AccuRate climate zones (69 in Australia). Other Second Generation software acceptable for use in Victoria now and after 30 April deadline includes BERS Professional and AccuRate. AccuRate shares a calculation engine with FirstRate 5 but has a more complete data input method which allows for more precise energy ratings but lacks FirstRate5's graphic interface. Each software package will be appropriate in different circumstances.Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) - Home Page Controversies * The rating system does not consider factors such as sustainable materials, embodied energy, electricity sources, rainwater capture, local vegetation and access to public transportation. * Some say that Carbon emissions would be a better metric to use compared to raw MegaJoules of Energy consumption. * Inaccurate representation of the building in the software can result in an inaccurate assessment of the building's thermal performance. An unskilled or inexperienced assessor can easily make incorrect assumptions. Some states require in-depth training & accreditation for all assessors before they are considered qualified to use the software, while other states merely highly recommend (but not require) in-depth training & accreditation. * While not a fault of the software itself, a building is often not constructed as drawn on the plans and some items (weather sealing, insulation values, window coverings, paint colours, etc.) are often different from what was originally simulated. In other unintentional cases, items are installed but are installed incorrectly in a way that compromises their thermal performance (such as foil-based insulation without an air gap). * In rare cases, certain styles of buildings in certain climates have become very difficult to comply without using expensive materials (such as a house on the side of a hill with solid glass walls along three sides, to provide ample viewing of the natural scenery). While most buildings can still find a solution without any major design alterations, sometimes this is only possible with expensive materials and this drastically increases the price of the house. This is usually an indication that the building was designed with aesthetics taking a prominent position over the comfort & livability of the occupants. * The rating system does not deal with problems beyond a single household such as urban sprawl, city planning, etc. Comparative energy audits of high-rise accommodation and free-standing homes would enable planning authorities to better understand what form of accommodation is more economic and energy efficient. * The rating system does not account for air-tight buildings with or without heat exchange units and is predominantly aimed toward the use of traditional building materials and does not open doors for newer higher quality building materials.  History  The Five Star Design Rating (FSDR) was an award developed in the 1980s for \\"high efficiency through excellence in design and construction\\" which assisted builders in marketing energy efficient home designs. The certification was developed by the Glass, Mass and Insulation Council of Australia (GMI Council) together with CSIRO Division of Building Research. The GMI Council was funded by Federal and State governments (NSW, SA, Tasmania, Victoria) and by private investors.Energy Efficient Building Design, Resource Book. 1992. Holger Willrath. Brisbane Institute of TAFE. Unit 1. Under FSDR, the basic elements of glass, mass and insulation were the basis of the design principles of a five star home.Ballinger, J. A. (1998). The Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme for Australia (BDP Environment Design Guide No.DES 22). Canberra: The Royal Australian Institute of Architects. The building industry did not widely accept the system due to its simple pass/fail rating and its restrictive guidelines.Development of a new framework for a House Rating Scheme (HRS) Maria Kordjamshidi. August 1997. University of New South Wales. In the 1990s, individual states developed their own schemes. The Victorian scheme, based on a computer program, was eventually accepted as the most effective. However, it worked poorly in warm humid climates such as found in Queensland. The development of a nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) began in 1993, based on the Victorian scheme, using the CHEETAH / CHEENATH engine developed at CSIRO. Software products NatHERS, FirstRate and Quick Rate, BERS, Q Rate and ACTHERS are based on this engine. NatHERS and BERS run the engine directly, while others use correlations based on the engine.

The puggle was first bred by designer dog breeders in the United States with the aim of producing a healthy companion dog that is less likely to inherit some health and behavioural issues common in the parent breeds. The cross is less likely to inherit a number of serious health issues common in the pug, particularly breathing issues associated with the breed's brachycephalic head, and is also less likely to inherit the energy, scent drive, and howl of the beagle; but due to the unpredictable nature of crossing two established breeds, puggles can still inherit both breathing disorders and high energy levels.

During that time, she oversaw the prosecution of the Central Park Five case, wherein five teenagers, four African-American and one Hispanic, were wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape and assault in Central Park of a white female jogger. All five convictions were vacated in 2002 after Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist and murderer, confessed to having been the sole perpetrator of the crime, and DNA testing showed he was the sole contributor of the DNA of the semen on the victim. After Reyes's confession in 2002, Fairstein still maintained that the wrongfully convicted teenage boys were guilty and she lauded the police investigation as \\"brilliant\\". In 2018, she insisted that the teenagers' confessions had not been coerced. After she left the DA's office in 2002, Fairstein began to publish mystery novels featuring Manhattan prosecutor Alexandra Cooper. Several have been bestsellers. In June 2019, after the release of the Netflix series When They See Us about the Central Park Five, Fairstein's publisher, Dutton, dropped her. Education Fairstein graduated with honors from Vassar College in 1969, with a degree in English literature. She graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1972, where she was one of a dozen women in her class.  Legal career  Fairstein joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 1972 as an Assistant District Attorney. In 1976 she was promoted to the head of the sex crimes unit, where she worked to support victims of crime. During her tenure, she prosecuted controversial and highly publicized cases, such as the \\"Preppy Murder case\\" against Robert Chambers in 1986, and the 1998 People v. Jovanovic cases. Fairstein, as Head of Sex Crimes, oversaw the prosecution of five juvenile defendants known as the \\"Central Park Five\\" in the 1989 \\"Central Park Jogger\\" case. The case was prosecuted by ADAs Elizabeth Lederer and Arthur Clements, with trials held in 1990. The convictions in the case were vacated in 2002 following a confession by the perpetrator, a convicted serial rapist and murderer, and confirmation by a DNA match to evidence at the scene. Fairstein left the District Attorney's office in 2002, and has continued to consult, write, lecture and serve as a sex crimes expert for a wide variety of print and television media outlets, including CNN, MSNBC and Larry King, among others. She has consulted for a number of media outlets during a number of high-profile prosecutions, including Michael Jackson's molestation charges in 2004, Kobe Bryant's sexual assault charges, and Scott Peterson's trial. She was also reportedly involved with a defense of Harvey Weinstein, helping to silence one of the sexual harassment complaints against him. Fairstein founded the Domestic Violence Committee of the New York Women's Agenda. She is a frequent speaker on issues related to domestic abuse.  Central Park Jogger case  Investigation, conviction and appeal = Fairstein's office supervised the prosecution in 1989 and 1990 of the Central Park Jogger case, which ended in the conviction of five teenagers whose convictions were later vacated. In a civil rights lawsuit filed in 2003, the five who were convicted claimed that Fairstein, with the assistance of the detectives at the 20th Precinct, coerced false confessions from them following up to thirty straight hours of interrogation and intimidation, of both the youths and their supporting adults. When Assistant US attorney David Nocenti, a \\"Big Brother\\" mentor to Yusef Salaam, one of the defendants, appeared at the precinct while the defendant was being grilled, plaintiffs claimed, Fairstein verbally abused him, demanded he leave immediately, and called her husband to demand the home number of Nocenti's boss, Brooklyn US Attorney Andrew Maloney, so she could get the young attorney fired. Fairstein said \\"Nobody under sixteen was talked to until a parent or guardian arrived... Three of the five went home and had a night's sleep before they were ever taken into custody. For most of them, the substance of their admissions came out within about an hour of the time they came in... I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don't think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants, not only in the other attacks that night but in the attack on the jogger. I watched more than thirty detectives‚Äîblack, white, Hispanic guys who'd never met each other before‚Äîconduct a brilliant investigation.\\" Lawyers for the five defendants contested almost every element of Fairstein's statement. All five accused teenagers later claimed their confessions were coerced during interrogation through lies and intimidation. In 1990 each of the \\"Central Park Five\\" were convicted of various assault and sexual battery charges, based in part on the allegedly false confessions obtained from them in 1989. Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise had signed written confessions, while Yousef Salaam made a verbal confession but refused to sign. Their convictions were upheld on appeal. Appellate court judge Vito Titone specifically named Fairstein in his dissenting opinion on the Salaam appeal. He said in an interview, \\"I was concerned about a criminal justice system that would tolerate the conduct of the prosecutor, Linda Fairstein, who deliberately engineered the 15-year-old's confession. ... Fairstein wanted to make a name. She didn't care. She wasn't a human.\\" = Vacating of convictions = All five convictions were vacated in 2002 after convicted rapist Matias Reyes confessed to the crime.Central Park Jogger Convictions Vacated Law.com. Reyes confessed after he \\"found religion.\\" The police had recovered DNA of only one man at the site of the crime, and none of the Central Park Five matched. The semen found on the victim contained DNA matching that of Reyes, confirming that he was the sole contributor, to a certainty of six billion to one. = Aftermath = In 2003, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana Jr., and Antron McCray sued the city of New York for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination and emotional distress. While the city refused to settle for 11 years, upon Mayor De Blasio taking office a settlement in the case was reached on June 19, 2014, for $41 million. Ken Burns and his daughter Sarah and her husband made a documentary film about the case, which he compared to the Scottsboro Boys case. The film, The Central Park Five, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2012 and was released on November 23, 2012. In May 2019, Netflix released a four-part drama series, When They See Us, about the case, directed by Ava DuVernay. In it, actress Felicity Huffman portrays Fairstein. Soon after the release, Fairstein's publisher, E.P. Dutton, released her as a client. Fairstein was also forced to resign from various non-profit board roles, including Safe Horizon. Fairstein also resigned from the Board of Trustees of Vassar College, her alma mater, after considerable pressure from the student body and members of the administration.https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/education/2019/06/04/linda- fairstein-central-park-five-case-resigns-vassar/1345650001/ On June 10, 2019, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by Fairstein, Netflix‚Äôs False Story of the Central Park Five, in which she says that five were not \\"totally innocent\\" (citing the other crimes they were convicted for, for which, she asserts, there is still substantial evidence) and that DuVernay had defamed her. In March 2020, Fairstein filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Netflix, DuVernay, and series writer Attica Locke for defamation based on her portrayal in the series.  Jovanovic controversy  Oliver Jovanovic sued Fairstein, alleging that she engaged in \\"false arrest, malicious prosecution, malicious abuse of process and denial of his right to a fair trial\\". This lawsuit stemmed from Fairstein's successful prosecution of Jovanovic in the case People v. Jovanovic, which was subsequently overturned on appeal.Decision of Supreme Court, Appellate Division, December 1999, including summary of all relevant facts It was dismissed with prejudice by a new trial judge. The dismissal was requested \\"in the interest of justice\\" by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.Charges Dismissed in Columbia Sexual Torture Case, The New York Times, November 2, 2001. There was no physical evidence linking Jovanovic to the crime. While his accuser claimed she had been brutally attacked and left bleeding, she was found to have only a few fading bruises. \\"If she [Fairstein] couldn't tell this was a false report, well, I am just shocked,\\" said former New York City sex crimes detective John Baeza, who worked in defense of Jovanovic after leaving the force. The $10 million lawsuit against Fairstein and two co-defendants, former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Gail Heatherly, who now teaches at the Columbia Law School, and New York City Police Detective Milton Bonilla, was dismissed on summary judgment in September 2010.  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  Fairstein assisted District Attorney Vance in his decision not to prosecute Dominique Strauss- Kahn for sexual assault in 2012. Fairstein's writing skills came into play in writing up the decision not to charge.  Awards  Among the awards Fairstein has received are the Federal Bar Council's Emory Buckner Award for Public Service, Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year Award, and the Nero Wolfe Award for Excellence in Crime Writing. In 2018, the Mystery Writers of America announced that it would honor Fairstein with one of its \\"Grand Master\\" awards for literary achievement. But two days after renewed controversy erupted in connection with her role in the case, the organization withdrew the honor. In 2019, shortly after the release of the Netflix series When They See Us about the Central Park Five case, Glamour Magazine said that the 1993 Woman of the Year Award to Fairstein was a mistake and that it was given to her before the full facts of the case were known.

U.S. Senator William F. Knowland was temporary chairman and former speaker of the House Joseph W. Martin Jr. served as permanent chairman. It renominated President Dwight D.

The 1956 Republican convention was held after that year's Democratic National Convention. This was unusual, as since 1864, in every election but 1888, Democrats had held their convention second.

The Trustees of Reservations owns and maintains the property. History Prior to European settlement of the area, the Weir Hill area was used by Algonquian peoples. A 1968 archaeological survey identified a campsite at the southeast end of the reservation. It is likely that Native Americans periodically set fire to the hill to improve the landscape for deer hunting and used fishing weirs to catch alewives in Cochichewick Brook before they reached Lake Cochichewick to spawn. The reservation takes its name from these weirs. In the mid 17th century, early settlers cleared the slopes of Weir Hill for grazing sheep and cattle. In the 18th and 19th centuries, milldams were built along Cochichewick Brook to lumber- and gristmills. Modern use and conservation Rising gently above Lake Cochichewick, Weir Hill offers hiking trails that pass over the crest of the double drumlin and track the shore of the lake. A rail trail runs along part of the hill, overlooking Lake Cochichewick. Many North Andover residents also use the trail system for cross-country, mountain biking, and its shores to go swimming. View from the top of Weir Hill, generally westward. Higher peaks visible through the haze may include Mount Wachusett and/or Mount Monadnock. Generations of agricultural use, wildfire, cutting and mowing have created a patchwork landscape on Weir Hill that supports ten different types of plant communities including a oak and hickory, hillside seeps, intermittent streams, and wet meadows. Several threatened species can be found on Weir Hill, including the white bog orchid, violet bush clover and butternut trees. Beginning with the park's establishment in 1968, Weir Hill has been expanded numerous times since to include more woodlands and conservation area.

Babu Brajalal Chatterjee, a patron of education, established it first as Hindu Academy in July 1902, replicating the Hindu College that was established in Calcutta in 1816. Like the Hindu College, the Hindu Academy of Daulatpur had two branches, the Chatushpathi and the college or academy. Expenses of the Chatushpathi students including food, lodging and tuition, were borne by the institution. Only residential students were admitted at the beginning. The academy was managed by a board of trustees of whom Babu Brajalal was the chairman. The academy started taking classes on 27 July 1902. Classes for the first and second year students began at a time. At its inception, the academy had only two tin-shed rooms with brick-and-cement floors and fence walls. At the beginning, the academy had only of land. Later, the Mohsin Fund donated of land from the Saidpur estate. The estate regularly disbursed a monthly donation of Rs 50 to the academy.

(2002). The Rise of the Medieval World 500‚Äì1300. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 111. Trobairitz is both singular and plural. The word trobairitz is first attested in the 13th- century romance Flamenca.The Occitan scholar Pierre Bec incorrectly believed it to be a hapax legomena. It comes from the Proven√ßal word trobar, the literal meaning of which is \\"to find\\", and the technical meaning of which is \\"to compose\\".Bruckner 1995, xi The French phrase \\"bien trouv√©\\" (\\"well found\\") still denotes an apt expression. The word trobairitz is used very rarely in medieval Occitan, as it does not occur in lyrical poetry, grammatical treatises or in the biographies (vidas) of the trobairitz or troubadours.Paden It does occur in the treatise Doctrina d'acort by Terramagnino da Pisa, written between 1282 and 1296. He uses it as an example of a word the plural and singular of which are the same.Elizabeth W. Poe, \\"Cantairitz e Trobairitz: A Forgotten Attestation of Old Proven√ßal ¬ªTrobairitz¬´,\\" Romanische Forschungen, 114, 2 (2002), pp. 206‚Äì215, at 207: \\"which are correctly used only with flexional endings in all numbers ... trobayritz\\" (sol per us de parladura en totz los nombres ... trobayritz). Poe, 210, n. 15, notes that \\"TROBAIRITZ is the same in the singular and plural of all cases\\". Trobairitz composed, wrote verses, and performed for the Occitan noble courts. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western secular music; all earlier known female composers wrote sacred music.Kibler, William W. (1995). Medieval France: An Encyclopedia The trobairitz were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the joglaressas.Bruckner 1992 Although troubadours sometimes came from humble origins--Bernart de Ventadorn might have been the son of a castle's baker--the trobairitz were usually nobly born. The most important trobairitz were Alamanda de Castelnau, Azalais de Porcairagues, Maria de Ventadorn, Tibors, Castelloza, Garsenda de Proen√ßa, Gormonda de Monpeslier, and the Comtessa de Di√°. Sources of information There are very few extant sources of information on the individual trobairitz. Almost all information which exists about them come from their vidas (biographies) and raz√≥s (contextual explanations of the songs), the brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called chansonniers. The vidas are notoriously unreliable, since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from the poems of the trobairitz themselves.Stephens The names of about twenty female poets from the 12th and 13th centuries survive, with an estimated thirty-two works attributed to the trobairitz. There are about 5 percent as many trobairitz as there are troubadours, and the number of surviving compositions by trobairitz amounts to around 1 percent of those we have by the troubadours. The earliest surviving lyric written by a trobairitz is that of Bels dous amics, written by Tibors around 1150.Earnshaw, Doris (1988). \\"The Female Voice in Medieval Romance Lyric\\". American University Studies 68. New York: Peter Lang Inc., International Academic Publishers. Only one survives with musical notation intact, \\"A chantar\\" by Comtessa de Di√° (see below). Some works which are anonymous in the sources are ascribed by certain modern editors to women, as are some works which are attributed to men in the manuscripts. For comparison, of the 460 male troubadours, about 2600 of their poems survive. Of these, about one in 10 survive with musical notation intact. Only two trobairitz have left us with more than one song apiece. Those two women are Comtessa de Dia, who leaves us with four cansos, and Castelloza, with three cansos and a fourth that is anonymous. The early chansonniers did not separate the works of the male troubadours from those of the trobairitz. It was only in later Italian and Catalan chansonniers that the works of the trobairitz were found in different sections than those of their male counterparts.Bruckner 1995, xxxiii Position in medieval society Throughout the 13th century, women of the court were expected to be able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or dialogue in the form of a poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills may have led to the writings of the trobairitz.Judith Tick. \\"Women in music, 500‚Äì1500\\", Grove Music Online. The trobairitz may also have arisen due to the power women held in southern France during the 12th and 13th centuries. Women had far more control over land ownership, and Occitan society was far more accepting of women than were most other societies of the time. During the Crusades many men were away, which left women with more administrative responsibility, and thus, power. Nevertheless, this society was not \\"feminist\\", nor was fin' amor, which exalted women while at the same time circumscribing many aspects of their lives and behavior. There is difficulty in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction between these two roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had as much time as professionals to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz. Both troubadours and trobairitz wrote of fin' amors, or courtly love. Women were generally the subject of the writings of troubadours, however: \\"No other group of poets give women so exalted a definition within so tightly circumscribed a context of female suppression.\\"\\"Troubadours, trouv√®res\\" The tension between the suppression of women present in the poetry of the troubadours and similar themes in the poetry of the trobairitz is a major source of discussion for modern commentators. Trobairitz poetry pertaining to love tended to offer a less idealized conception of the subject than the poetry of their male counterparts, with a more conversational and less flourished style of writing intended to more closely emulate a more grounded vision of relationships. The trobairitz wrote in the canso (strophic song) and tenso (debate poem) genres.Bruckner, Matilda Tomaryn; et al. (1995). Songs of the Women Troubadours, xii. Besides cansos and tensos, trobairitz also wrote sirventes (political poems), planh (lament), salut d‚Äô amor (a love letter not in strophic form), alba (dawn songs), and balada (dance songs).Bruckner, Matilda Tomaryn; et al. (1995). Songs of the Women Troubadours, xxxix Judging by what survives today, the trobairitz wrote no pastorelas or malmariee songs, unlike their troubadour counterparts. Furthermore, in keeping with the troubadour tradition, the trobairitz closely linked the action of the singing to the action of loving. Comtessa de Dia demonstrates this in her poem Fin ioi me don'alegranssa, stating that \\"Fin ioi me dona alegranssa/per qu'eu chan plus gaiamen,\\" translated as \\"Happiness brings me pure joy/which makes me sing more cheerfully.\\"Bruckner, Matilda Tomaryn; et al. (1995). Songs of the Women Troubadours, xv. Attribution The number of works attributed to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There are a number of reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript.Dronke Some of these were between men, and some were between a man and a woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.Dronke, Peter. Women Writers of the Middle Ages, Cambridge University Press (New York, 1984) Since poetry was highly stylized, it is difficult to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman, or a man speaking as a woman. This adds to the difficulty of attribution, especially of anonymous writers. There is some debate as to whether or not the poems by the trobairitz represent genuine feminine voices, since they worked within the highly circumscribed conventions of the troubadours. Matilda Bruckner suggests that the trobairitz \\"spoke in her own voice as channeled through the voices of many others\\". By manipulating the strict constructs of troubadour lyric, the trobairitz were able to create their own \\"fictions of the female voice\\". There is one notable instance where clear attribution is given to a woman, Bieiris de Romans (also given as Beatritz), but the subject of the poem is another woman, Na Maria. In the poem \\"Na Maria\\" Beatritz expresses her love for Maria in the traditional fin' amors style, both in terms of physical longing and courtly admiration. This poem, if not clearly marked as by a woman, would be assumed to be by a man. Some controversy surrounds the works of the Bieiris de Romans, as scholars have suggested that her canso expresses \\"lesbian desire.\\" The troubadour would typically speak to the domna (woman); the fact that the lyrical dialogue takes place exclusively between one woman and another is an extreme rarity.Rieger, Angelica.

Brojomohun College, Barisal (also BM College), is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Bangladesh. It is located in the city of Barisal in south-western Bangladesh. History On June 14, 1889, Aswini Kumar Dutta founded Brojo Mohan College, which was named after his father, Brajamohan Dutta. The first principal of the college was Babu Gyan Chandra Chowdhury. While Ashwini Kumar Dutta taught English and logic, Kali Prasanna Ghosh taught history and Kamini Kumar BidyaRatna taught Sanskrit and Bengali. In 1898, BM College was transformed into a \\"First Grade College\\" from a \\"Second Grade College\\". In 1912, the college went to government management from personal management strategy. In the beginning the college used the BM School campus and was relocated its own present complex sometime later. BM College, affiliated to Calcutta University, started honours course in English and philosophy in 1922, in Sanskrit and mathematics in 1925, in chemistry in 1928, and finally in economics in 1929. The time from 1922 to 1948 is called the \\"Golden Period\\" of the college. The governor of Bengal at that time, Sir Udbarn, once commented on BM College, \\"The college promises some day to challenge the supremacy of the metropolitan (Presidency) College.\\" After the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the college lacked teachers and the student body fell to one third of its post-war size. This made it difficult to teach the same numbers of courses and as a result the two year Honors curriculum conducted by Calcutta University was replaced with the three Honors curriculum of Dhaka University. As a consequence, Honors courses except Mathematics were abolished in 1950. In 1952, Honors in mathematics had also been discontinued. In 1964, Honors in economics restarted. Several other Honors and Masters Courses started between 1972 and 2005. The time since 1965 has been called the \\"Age of Enrichment\\" of the college. There are 20 degree (pass) courses, 18 Honors courses and 19 Masters courses at BM College. The HSC course was abolished in 1999. Academic departments Main building The university has 22 departments under 4 faculties.

He pursued each of these for over two decades, and each led to one or more book-length collections. Although previously a respected name in Japanese photography, Note Kikai's winning of the Ina Nobuo Award in 1988 (for details, see below); and the inclusion by 2000 of his works in the permanent collection of the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography as implied by Sumiyo Mitsuhashi (), \\"Kikai Hiroo\\" (), Nihon shashinka jiten () / 328 Outstanding Japanese Photographers (Kyoto: Tank≈çsha, 2000; ), p. 98 (despite its alternative title in English, the book is in Japanese only). Kikai was not widely known until 2004, when the first edition of his book Persona, a collection of Asakusa portraits, won both the Domon Ken Award and Annual Award of the PSJ.Domon Ken Award: \\"Domon Ken‚Äìsh≈ç no rekishi to zen- jush≈ç-shashinka\\" (, list of award-winners since 1982) (accessed 6 March 2006). PSJ award: \\"2004-nen Nihon Shashin Ky≈çkai-sh≈ç jush≈çsha\\". In 2009, the ICP and Steidl copublished Asakusa Portraits for an international market. Early years Kikai was born in the village of Daigo (now part of Sagae, Yamagata Prefecture) on 18 March 1945 as the seventh and last child (and fifth son) of the family.Place of birth, siblings: K≈çtar≈ç Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\" (), in Japanƒ´zu fotogurafƒÅzu: 14nin no shashinka-tachi no \\"ima\\" () / Japanese photographers (Tokyo: Hakusuisha, 2005; ), p. 131\\\\.

He had a happy childhood, from the age of 11 or so preferring to play by himself in the nature that surrounded the village.Noriyuki Kanda (, Kanda Noriyuki), \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç: Shashinka Kikai Hiroo: Jinsei no fuhen o toru to iu otoko\\" (, A portrait of today: The photographer Hiroh Kikai: The man who photographs the universality of life), Aera, 25 April 2005. p. 61 (the article runs pp. 59‚Äì63). He graduated from high school in 1963 and worked in Yamagata for a year, and then went to Hosei University in Tokyo to study philosophy. As a student he was keen on the cinema ‚Äì he particularly enjoyed the films of Andrzej Wajda, who would later contribute essays to some of his books, and Satyajit Ray ‚Äî and said that he would have worked in film production if it did not require writing, a task he never enjoyed, and money, which he lacked.Film tastes: Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", p. 132\\\\. Film as a career: Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 63. Immediately after his graduation in 1968,Both Kikai's book Perusona / Persona (first impression, 2005, n.p.) and his T≈çky≈ç Mutan / Labyrinthos (first impression, 2007, n.p.) say 1978, presumably first a typo or mistake and then inherited misinformation. His other books India (n.p.) and Ya-Chimata (n.p.) have him graduating in 1969. His book In-between 8 says 1968. (For details see \\"Books by Kikai\\".) Kikai said that 1968 is correct (conversation, 3 March 2006). Kikai worked for two years as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard.Hideko Oiwake (, Oiwake Hideko), \\"Kindaika ni norenakatta otoko: Kikai Hiroo\\" (, A man who couldn't get on board modernization: Hiroh Kikai), Shashin Jidai, November 1984, p. 141. Meanwhile, he stayed in touch with his philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Sh≈çji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai.Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", pp. 132‚Äì33; Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 62. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¬•40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¬•600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¬•320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80 mm lens, was what Kikai used for his portraits thereafter.Purchase and use of the Hasselblad: \\"Watashi ky≈ç kin≈ç ashita 24: Kikai Hiroo san\\" (, Me today yesterday tomorrow 24: Hiroh Kikai), Croissant no. 640, 10 July 2004, p. 98 (the article runs pp. 98‚Äì101). Career Kikai thought that work on a boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, could not get a job on one. He was eventually accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port.Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 62. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi.Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", p. 133; Kikai, \\"Sen'in tech≈ç bang≈ç: Misaki 16000\\" () / \\"Seamen's Registered Number: Misaki 16000\\", Camera Mainichi, May 1973, pp. 95‚Äì101 (the minimal text within the latter is in Japanese only, despite its secondary title in English). In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers' Association.Mitsuhashi, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", p. 98. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973‚Äì76).Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", p. 134. He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second. Living close to Asakusa (Tokyo), Kikai often went there on his days off, taking photographs of visitors. He stepped up his visits in 1985; a number of collections of his portraits taken there have been published. Kikai's other long-term photographic projects are of working and residential neighborhoods in and near Tokyo, and of people and scenes in India and Turkey. All these are black and white. However, his occasional diversions included color photographs of the Got≈ç Islands and even of nudes.Got≈ç islands: \\"Nihon o aruk≈ç (19): Kikai Hiroo to aruku (Nagasaki): Got≈ç rett≈ç\\" (, Walking around Japan [19]: Walking with Hiroh Kikai [Nagasaki]: The Got≈ç islands), Photo Contest, July 2006, pp. 4, 6, 8‚Äì16. Nudes: \\"Hareta hi ni\\" () / \\"On clear day\\", Asahi Camera, July 2005, pp. 47‚Äì52. Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai was never in any group, preferring to work by himself.Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 61. When not setting out to take photographs, Kikai did not carry a camera with him. He left photographing his own family to his wife Noriko, and it is she who had the camera if they went on a trip together.Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 63. In the early part of his career, Kikai often had to earn money in other ways: after three years' work in the darkroom, he returned to manual labor.Oiwake, \\"Kindaika ni norenakatta otoko\\", p. 141\\\\. By his own account in 1980 he briefly worked at an Isuzu plant, in 1982 in a Subaru plant.Kikai, ≈åtachi no sh≈çz≈ç / Ecce homo, n.p. (for details see \\"Books by Kikai\\"). Kikai taught for some time at Musashino Art University, but he was disappointed by the students' lack of sustained effort and therefore quit.Name of the university: \\"Domon-Ken-sh≈ç jush≈ç kinen Kikai Hiroo shashinten 'Persona' \\"; this says that he started there in 1994.

Asakusa portraits Kikai had started his Asakusa series of square, monochrome portraits as early as 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, when he realized that an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sens≈ç-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands directly in front of the camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards.Backdrop and constraints: Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", pp. 134‚Äì35. Autocord and Hasselblad: Iizawa, \\"Kikai Hiroo\\", p. 134. Kikai might wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wanted to photograph, and three or four days might pass without a single photograph; but he might photograph three people in a single day, and he photographed over six hundred people in this way.Time spent waiting, number photographed: \\"Watashi ky≈ç kin≈ç ashita 24\\", p. 98. Days with no photos, three people in a day: \\"Watakushi no naka no 'Persona' \\" (, My Persona), Tokyojin, November 2003, pp. 152‚Äì53 (Kikai in conversation with Midori Nakano and Taichi Yamada; article runs p. 148‚Äì54). He believed that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.\\"Watashi ky≈ç kin≈ç ashita 24\\", p. 99; \\"Watakushi no naka no 'Persona' \\", p. 149. Though Kikai started to photograph in Asakusa simply because it was near where he then lived, he continued because of the nature of the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were as popular and crowded as it was before the war, Kikai said, he would go somewhere else.\\"Watakushi no naka no 'Persona' \\", p. 150. Published in 1987, ≈åtachi no sh≈çz≈ç / Ecce Homo was the first collection of these portraits. It is a large- format book with portraits made in Asakusa in 1985 to '86. Kikai won the 1988 Newcomer's Award of the Photographic Society of Japan (PSJ) for this book and the third Ina Nobuo Award for the accompanying exhibition.PSJ award: PSJ, \\"Kako no jush≈çsha ichiran\\" (, List of past PSJ award-winners) (accessed 6 March 2006); PSJ, \\"2004-nen Nihon Shashin Ky≈çkai-sh≈ç jush≈çsha\\" (, PSJ prize- winners for 2004) (accessed 6 March 2006). Ina Nobuo Award: announcement of 13th Ina Nobuo award, 1988 (, 13th Ina Nobuo Award [1988], Hiroh Kikai, Ecce Homo), Nikon (accessed 5 March 2006.) Also see Ina Nobuo sh≈ç 20-nen: Nikon Saron ni miru gendai shashin no nenpu () / Ina Nobuo Award '76‚Äì'95, Nikon Salon Books 23 (Tokyo: Nikon, 1996), with a few pages devoted to the works of each of the winners of the Ina Nobuo Award to date (Kikai is on pp. 96‚Äì101), and also lists of the exhibitions at the Ginza and Shinjuku Nikon Salons. In 1995, a number of portraits from the series were shown together with the works of eleven other photographers in Tokyo/City of Photos, one of a pair of opening exhibitions for the purpose-made building of the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography.Tokyo/City of Photos, the published catalogue of the exhibition (for details see \\"Other works with contributions by Kikai\\"). Ya- Chimata, published a year later, has a greater number of portraits printed more cheaply on smaller pages. Persona (2003) is a further collection of portraits made in Asakusa. A few are from Kikai's earliest work, but most postdate anything in the earlier books. Several of the subjects appear twice or more often, so the reader sees the effect of time. The book format is unusually large for a photograph collection in Japan, and the plates were printed via quadtone.Kanda, \\"Gendai no sh≈çz≈ç\\", p. 60. The book won the 23rd Domon Ken Award and 2004 Annual Award of the PSJ. A smaller-format edition with additional photographs followed two years later. Asakusa Portraits (2008) is a large collection edited by the International Center of Photography (New York), published in conjunction with the ICP's exhibition of recent Japanese photography and art Heavy Light. Kikai's contribution to this exhibition was well received,Favorable reviews of Kikai's photographs in \\"Heavy Light\\": Roberta Smith, \\"Japanese Culture, in Vivid Color\\", New York Times, 13 June 2008 (accessed 17 September 2008, requires registration but no payment); Heesun Wee, \\"Summer's photo finish with Atget, Evans, Kikai, Fusco \\", Newyorkology, 22 August 2008 (accessed 17 September 2008); \\"Goings On About Town\\", New Yorker, 30 June 2008 (accessed 17 September 2008). and Asakusa Portraits won praise for its photography and also (from Paul Smith) for the vernacular fashion of those photographed.Photography: J√∂rg M. Colberg, \\"Review: Asakusa Portraits by Hiroh Kikai \\", Conscientious, 10 September 2008; J√∂rg M. Colberg, \\"Best Photo Books 2008\\", Conscientious, 16 December 2008 (both accessed 1 January 2011). Fashion: Paul Smith, \\"Kikai Style \\", vogue.co.uk, 10 September 2008 (accessed 17 July 2009). Portraits of spaces Kikai said that people and scenery are two sides of the same coin.\\"Watashi ky≈ç kin≈ç ashita 24\\", p. 99. When tired of waiting (or photographing) in Asakusa, he would walk as far as 20 km looking for urban scenes of interest where he could make \\"portraits of spaces\\".\\"Watashi ky≈ç kin≈ç ashita 24\\", p. 98. \\"Portraits of spaces\\" (, K≈´kan no p≈çtoreito): afterword to T≈çky≈ç meiro / Tokyo Labyrinth (for details see \\"Books by Kikai\\"). A day's walk might take two or three hours for less than a single roll of 120 film.Time, quantity: Noriyuki Kanda, \\"Kikai Hiroo no T≈çky≈ç: Miru me, erabu me\\" (), The Tokyo of Hiroh Kikai: The seeing eye, the selecting eye), Asahi Camera, November 2006, pp. 232‚Äì33. He generally photographed between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., and avoided photographing when people were outside as their presence would transform the photographs into mere snapshots, easily understood; even without people, they are the images or reflections of life.Time: \\"T≈çky≈ç meiro o megutte\\" (, About Tokyo Labyrinth), Tokyojin, February 2000, p. 110 (Kikai in conversation with Suehiro Tanemura and Iwao Matsuyama []). Peopling, snapshots, image/reflection of life (seikatsu no kage, ): \\"T≈çky≈ç meiro o megutte\\", p. 109; Kanda, \\"Kikai Hiroo no T≈çky≈ç\\". Kikai might find a scene that he wanted to photograph and then wait there and only photograph it when something unexpected occurred in the frame. After development, he did not bother with contact prints, instead judging a photograph by the negative alone.Waiting for the unexpected, avoidance of contact prints: Kanda, \\"Kikai Hiroo no T≈çky≈ç\\". Samples from this series appeared in various magazines from at least as early as 1976.See for example \\"Nagi\\" (Âá™, Calm), Camera Mainichi, June 1976, pp. 119‚Äì25. Each photograph is simply captioned with the approximate address (in Japanese script) and year. T≈çky≈ç meiro / Tokyo Labyrinth (1999) presents portraits of unpeopled spaces in Tokyo (and occasionally the adjacent town of Kawasaki). There are individual shopfronts, rows of shops and residential streets. Most of the buildings are unpretentious. Like the Asakusa series, these portraits are monochrome and square, taken via a standard lens on 120 film.Standard lens: afterword to T≈çky≈ç meiro / Tokyo Labyrinth. T≈çky≈ç mutan / Labyrinthos (2007) ‚Äî based on an essay/photograph series that ran in the monthly S≈çshi () from March 2004 to July 2005 and then in the web series \\"Tokyo Polka\\"S≈çshi is produced by S≈çshisha, the publisher of Labyrinthos. Some photographs within the book had also appeared elsewhere, e.g. issue 2 (October 2004) of Tamaya (). \\"Tokyo Polka \\" was a series of essays, each illustrated with photographs (accessed 24 February 2006; as of 28 May 2007, the essays and photographs had been removed, leaving only a short description; earlier versions do not seem to be available via the Wayback Machine.) Continues in \\"Yurari-yurayura-ki \\". ‚Äî presents more of the same. Between a single nude in a shopfront display from 1978 and a very young boy photographed in December 2006 (the latter appearing to share the Sens≈ç-ji backdrop of Persona), are square monochrome views of Tokyo and Kawasaki, compositions that seem casual and rather disorderly, mostly of unpeopled scenes showing signs of intensive and recent use. The book also has Kikai's essays from \\"Tokyo Polka\\", essays that dwell on the inhabitants of Tokyo as observed during walks or on the train. Tokyo View (2016) is a large- format collection, mostly of photographs that also appear in one or other of the earlier books (or T≈çky≈ç p≈çtoreito / Tokyo Portraits). India Kikai said that going to India felt like a return to the Yamagata of his youth, and a release from life in Tokyo.\\"T≈çky≈ç Meiro o megutte\\", pp. 114, 115. His photography there was much less planned or formal than his portraits of people or places in Tokyo: after an early start with color 120 film, he used black and white 35 mm film in India ‚Äì and laughingly said that he would use 35 mm in Tokyo if the city were more interesting and didn't make him feel unhappy.Color photographs of India: Kikai, \\"Indo: Higan to shigan\\" (, India: The world of the Buddha and our world), Camera Mainichi, November 1981, pp. 24‚Äì29. (Kikai mentions use of a Minolta Autocord and a Rolleiflex.) On Tokyo: \\"T≈çky≈ç Meiro o megutte\\", p. 115. India, a large-format book published in 1992, presents photographs taken in India (and to a much lesser extent Bangladesh) over a period totalling rather more than a year and ranging from 1982 to 1990. It won high praise from the critic Kazuo Nishii, who commented that the India of Kikai's work seems perpetually overcast, and that in their ambiguity his photographs seem to benefit from the work done in the Asakusa portrait series.Kazuo Nishii, \\"Kikai Hiroo (India)\\" (), in Shashinteki kioku (, Photographic memories) (Tokyo: Seiky≈´sha, 1997; ), 173‚Äì77 (first appeared in an unspecified publication of Misuzu Shob≈ç, November 1992). The book won Kikai the 1993 Society of Photography Award.Society of Photography, Awards, 1 (1989) ‚Äì 10 (1998) (accessed 4 April 2007). Shiawase / Shanti (2001) is a collection of photographs that concentrates on children, most of which were taken in Allahabad, Benares, Calcutta, Puri and Delhi in 2000.Afterword, Shiawase / Shanti (for details see \\"Books by Kikai\\"). It won the Grand Prix of the second Photo City Sagamihara Festival.\\"Domon-Ken-sh≈ç jush≈ç kinen Kikai Hiroo shashinten 'Persona' \\". Turkey Wanting to explore somewhere that (in contrast to India) was cold, as well as a Muslim land where Asian and European cultures meet, in 1994 Kikai made the first of six visits to Turkey, where he stayed for a total of nine months.\\"Hyakunengo nimo hibiku koe o totta tabi\\" (), Asahi Camera, November 2010, p.225. His monochrome photographs of Turkey appeared in the magazine Asahi Camera,As installments of \\"Anatoria kik≈ç\\" () / \\"A Journey to Anatolia\\", Asahi Camera, June 2001, pp. 55‚Äì61; January 2003, pp. 72‚Äì79; March 2006, pp. 68‚Äì75.

Photography elsewhere Kikai was one of thirteen Japanese photographers invited by EU‚ÄìJapan Fest to photograph the twenty-six nations of the European Union; he spent twenty-one days in Malta in September 2005 and a short period in Portugal in October 2004, travelling widely in both countries.Length of stay in Malta: Hiroh Kikai, In-between 8, n.p. (for details see \\"Books by Kikai\\"). Month and year: Kikai, \\"Porutogaru kik≈ç\\" () / \\"My Portugal\\", Nippon Camera, December 2005, p. 16. In color, these photographs are a departure from his earlier work. Most are more or less candid photographs of people. A collection was published as the eighth in a series of fourteen volumes, In-between. Series of color photographs from short visits to Cuba (2007) and Taiwan (2013) have appeared in Asahi Camera.Kikai, \\"Habana no heijitsu\\" () / \\"Ordinary Days in Havana, Cuba, 2007\\", Asahi Camera, October 2007, pp. 47‚Äì56. Kikai, \\"Taiwan e\\" (), Asahi Camera, November 2013, pp. 29‚Äì36. Writing Kikai's essays have appeared in periodicals and within some of his own photobooks. They have also been collected in four books, in which they are illustrated by reproductions of relevant photographs. Indo ya Gassan (\\"India and Gassan\\", 1999) is a collection of essays about and photographs of India. Gassan is a mountain in central Yamagata close to where Kikai was brought up; Kikai muses on India and compares it with the Yamagata of his youth. Me to kaze no kioku (\\"Memories of the eye and the wind\\", 2012) collects essays published in Yamagata Shinbun () since 2006; Dare omo sukoshi suki ni naru hi: Memekuri b≈çbiroku (\\"Days when you come to like anyone a little: An image-turning aide-memoire\\", 2015) collects essays published in Bungakukai () since 2011; Kutsuzoku no herikata (\\"Ways to wear down shoe rubber\\", 2016) is a fourth collection.

It is named after Saint Bartholomew the Apostle (Bartholom√§us in German), patron of alpine farmers and dairymen. The church is located at the western shore of the K√∂nigssee lake, on the Hirschau peninsula. It can only be reached by ship or after a long hike across the surrounding mountains. A first chapel at the lake was built in 1134 by the Provosts of Berchtesgaden. In 1697 it was rebuilt in a Baroque style with a floor plan modeled on Salzburg Cathedral, two onion domes and a red domed roof. The church features stucco work by the Salzburg artist Joseph Schmidt and a three-apse choir. The altars in the apses are consecrated to Saint Bartholomew, Saint Catherine, and Saint James respectively. An annual pilgrimage to St. Bartholomew's is held on the Saturday after 24 August, starting from the Austrian municipality of Maria Alm and crossing the Berchtesgaden Alps. Near the chapel lies the old hunting lodge of the same name. The lodge, which was first erected in the 12th century with the church, has been rebuilt several times. Until 1803, it was a private residence of the Berchtesgaden Prince-provosts; after their territory had been incorporated into the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, the building became a favourite hunting lodge of the ruling House of Wittelsbach; today it is an inn. The church can be seen from a famous scenic viewpoint 743 meters above, which is called Archenkanzel.

Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult. Nonpoint source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted runoff from agricultural areas draining into a river, or wind-borne debris blowing out to sea. Nonpoint source air pollution affects air quality, from sources such as smokestacks or car tailpipes. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a nonpoint source of pollution; if the discharges were to occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location, the pollution would be single-point. NPS may derive from many different sources with no specific solutions or changes to rectify the problem, making it difficult to regulate. Nonpoint source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as lawn fertilization, applying pesticides, road construction or building construction. It is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and hydromodification the primary sources. Other significant sources of runoff include habitat modification and silviculture (forestry). Contaminated stormwater washed off parking lots, roads and highways, and lawns (often containing fertilizers and pesticides) is called urban runoff. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to nearby surface waters. However, not all urban runoff flows through storm drain systems before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, sewage treatment plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true nonpoint sources as municipalities work to abate them. Principal types Runoff of soil and fertilizer during a rain storm Sediment Sediment (loose soil) includes silt (fine particles) and suspended solids (larger particles). Sediment may enter surface waters from eroding stream banks, and from surface runoff due to improper plant cover on urban and rural land.Iowa State University. University Extension. Ames, IA. \\"Iowa Fact Sheet: Agriculture and Water Quality.\\" October 2001. Document No. EDC232a. Sediment creates turbidity (cloudiness) in water bodies, reducing the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels also inhibit drinking water purification systems. Sediment can also be discharged from multiple different sources. Sources include construction sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with erosion controls and sediment controls), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. \\"Nonpoint Source Pollution.\\" . Nutrients Nonpoint source pollution is caused when precipitation (1) carries pollutants from the ground such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants which come from fertilizers used on farm lands (2) or urban areas (3). These nutrients can cause eutrophication (4). Nutrients mainly refers to inorganic matter from runoff, landfills, livestock operations and crop lands. The two primary nutrients of concern are phosphorus and nitrogen.Rob Leeds, Larry C. Brown, Nathan L. Watermeier. \\"Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering.\\" Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Phosphorus is a nutrient that occurs in many forms that are bioavailable. It is notoriously over-abundant in human sewage sludge. It is a main ingredient in many fertilizers used for agriculture as well as on residential and commercial properties, and may become a limiting nutrient in freshwater systems and some estuaries. Phosphorus is most often transported to water bodies via soil erosion because many forms of phosphorus tend to be adsorbed on to soil particles. Excess amounts of phosphorus in aquatic systems (particularly freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) leads to proliferation of microscopic algae called phytoplankton. The increase of organic matter supply due to the excessive growth of the phytoplankton is called eutrophication. A common symptom of eutrophication is algae blooms that can produce unsightly surface scums, shade out beneficial types of plants, produce taste-and-odor-causing compounds, and poison the water due to toxins produced by the algae. These toxins are a particular problem in systems used for drinking water because some toxins can cause human illness and removal of the toxins is difficult and expensive. Bacterial decomposition of algal blooms consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, generating hypoxia with detrimental consequences for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Nitrogen is the other key ingredient in fertilizers, and it generally becomes a pollutant in saltwater or brackish estuarine systems where nitrogen is a limiting nutrient. Similar to phosphorus in fresh- waters, excess amounts of bioavailable nitrogen in marine systems lead to eutrophication and algae blooms. Hypoxia is an increasingly common result of eutrophication in marine systems and can impact large areas of estuaries, bays, and near shore coastal waters. Each summer, hypoxic conditions form in bottom waters where the Mississippi River enters the Gulf of Mexico. During recent summers, the aerial extent of this \\"dead zone\\" is comparable to the area of New Jersey and has major detrimental consequences for fisheries in the region. Nitrogen is most often transported by water as nitrate (NO3). The nitrogen is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or ammonia (NH3), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until oxidation converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., interflow and tile drainage) is the most likely to transport it, rather than surface runoff. Toxic contaminants and chemicals Compounds including heavy metals like lead, mercury, zinc, and cadmium, organics like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fire retardants, and other substances are resistant to breakdown. These contaminants can come from a variety of sources including human sewage sludge, mining operations, vehicle emissions, fossil fuel combustion, urban runoff, industrial operations and landfills. Toxic chemicals mainly include organic compounds and inorganic compounds. These compounds include pesticides like DDT, acids, and salts that have severe effects to the ecosystem and water-bodies. These compounds can threaten the health of both humans and aquatic species while being resistant to environmental breakdown, thus allowing them to persist in the environment. These toxic chemicals could come from croplands, nurseries, orchards, building sites, gardens, lawns and landfills. Acids and salts mainly are inorganic pollutants from irrigated lands, mining operations, urban runoff, industrial sites and landfills. Pathogens Pathogens are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans. Typically, pathogens cause disease when they are present in public drinking water supplies. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include: * Cryptosporidium parvum * Giardia lamblia * Salmonella * Norovirus and other viruses * Parasitic worms (helminths). Coliform bacteria and fecal matter may also be detected in runoff. These bacteria are a commonly used indicator of water pollution, but not an actual cause of disease.U.S. Geological Survey. Reston, VA. \\"A Primer on Water Quality.\\" FS-027-01. March 2001. Pathogens may contaminate runoff due to poorly managed livestock operations, faulty septic systems, improper handling of pet waste, the over application of human sewage sludge, contaminated storm sewers, and sanitary sewer overflows. Principal sources=Urban and suburban areas Urban and suburban areas are a main sources of nonpoint source pollution due to the amount of runoff that is produced due to the large amount of paved surfaces. Paved surfaces, such as asphalt and concrete are impervious to water penetrating them. Any water that is on contact with these surfaces will run off and be absorbed by the surrounding environment. These surfaces make it easier for stormwater to carry pollutants into the surrounding soil. Construction sites tend to have disturbed soil that is easily eroded by precipitation like rain, snow, and hail. Additionally, discarded debris on the site can be carried away by runoff waters and enter the aquatic environment. Typically, in suburban areas, chemicals are used for lawn care. These chemicals can end up in runoff and enter the surrounding environment via storm drains in the city. Since the water in storm drains is not treated before flowing into surrounding water bodies, the chemicals enter the water directly. Agricultural operations Agricultural operations account for a large percentage of all nonpoint source pollution in the United States. When large tracts of land are plowed to grow crops, it exposes and loosens soil that was once buried. This makes the exposed soil more vulnerable to erosion during rainstorms. It also can increase the amount of fertilizer and pesticides carried into nearby bodies of water. Atmospheric inputs Atmospheric deposition is a source of inorganic and organic constituents because these constituents are transported from sources of air pollution to receptors on the ground.Colman, J.A., Rice, K.C., and Willoughby, T.C., 2001, Methodology and significance of studies of atmospheric deposition in highway runoff: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 01-259, 63 p. https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr2001259Lopes, T.J., Dionne, S.G., 1998, A review of semivolatile and volatile organic compounds in highway runoff and urban stormwater: U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report 98-409, 67 p. https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr98409. Typically, industrial facilities, like factories, emit air pollution via a smokestack. Although this is a point source, due to the distributional nature, long-range transport, and multiple sources of the pollution, it can be considered as nonpoint source in the depositional area. Atmospheric inputs that affect runoff quality may come from dry deposition between storm events and wet deposition during storm events. The effects of vehicular traffic on the wet and dry deposition that occurs on or near highways, roadways, and parking areas creates uncertainties in the magnitudes of various atmospheric sources in runoff. Existing networks that use protocols sufficient to quantify these concentrations and loads do not measure many of the constituents of interest and these networks are too sparse to provide good deposition estimates at a local scale Highway runoff Highway runoff accounts for a small but widespread percentage of all nonpoint source pollution.Gupta, M.K., Agnew, R.W., Gruber, D., and Kreutzberger, W.A., 1981, Constituents of highway runoff, in v.

Forestry and mining operations Forestry and mining operations can have significant inputs to nonpoint source pollution. =Forestry= Forestry operations reduce the number of trees in a given area, thus reducing the oxygen levels in that area as well. This action, coupled with the heavy machinery (harvesters, etc.) rolling over the soil increases the risk of erosion. =Mining= Active mining operations are considered point sources, however runoff from abandoned mining operations contribute to nonpoint source pollution. In strip mining operations, the top of the mountain is removed to expose the desired ore. If this area is not properly reclaimed once the mining has finished, soil erosion can occur. Additionally, there can be chemical reactions with the air and newly exposed rock to create acidic runoff. Water that seeps out of abandoned subsurface mines can also be highly acidic. This can seep into the nearest body of water and change the pH in the aquatic environment. Marinas and boating activities Chemicals used for boat maintenance, like paint, solvents, and oils find their way into water through runoff. Additionally, spilling fuels or leaking fuels directly into the water from boats contribute to nonpoint source pollution. Nutrient and bacteria levels are increased by poorly maintained sanitary waste receptacles on the boat and pump-out stations. Control Contour buffer strips used to retain soil and reduce erosion  Regulation of Nonpoint Source Pollution in the United States  The definition of a nonpoint source is addressed under the U.S. Clean Water Act as interpreted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The law does not provide for direct federal regulation of nonpoint sources, but state and local governments may do so pursuant to state laws. For example, many states have taken the steps to implement their own management programs for places such as their coastlines, all of which have to be approved by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA. The goals of these programs and those alike are to create foundations that encourage statewide pollution reduction by growing and improving systems that already exist. Programs within these state and local governments look to best management practices (BMPs) in order to accomplish their goals of finding the least costly method to reduce the greatest amount of pollution. BMPs can be implemented for both agricultural and urban runoff, and can also be either structural or nonstructural methods. Federal agencies, including EPA and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, have approved and provided a list of commonly used BMPs for the many different categories of nonpoint source pollution.  U.S. Clean Water Act provisions for states  319 grant program for states and territories = Congress authorized the CWA section 319 grant program in 1987. Grants are provided to states, territories, and tribes in order to encourage implementation and further development in policy. The law requires all states to operate NPS management programs. EPA requires regular program updates in order to effectively manage the ever-changing nature of their waters, and to ensure effective use of the 319 grant funds and resources. = Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) = The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) of 1990 created a program under the Coastal Zone Management Act that mandates development of nonpoint source pollution management measures in states with coastal waters. CZARA requires states with coastlines to implement management measures to remediate water pollution, and to make sure that the product of these measures is implementation as opposed to adoption. Urban and suburban areas To control nonpoint source pollution, many different approaches can be undertaken in both urban and suburban areas. Buffer strips provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water. This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic system. Retention ponds can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of porous pavement allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, reducing the amount of runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as constructing wetlands are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination. Construction sites typically implement simple measures to reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or silt fences are erected around construction sites to reduce the amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body. Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution. In areas served by single-home septic systems, local government regulations can force septic system maintenance to ensure compliance with water quality standards. In Washington (state), a novel approach was developed through a creation of a \\"shellfish protection district\\" when either a commercial or recreational shellfish bed is downgraded because of ongoing nonpoint source pollution. The shellfish protection district is a geographic area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources, and provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control nonpoint sources of pollution. At least two shellfish protection districts in south Puget Sound have instituted septic system operation and maintenance requirements with program fees tied directly to property taxes. Agricultural operations To control sediment and runoff, farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include contour plowing, crop mulching, crop rotation, planting perennial crops or installing riparian buffers.U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Fort Worth, TX. National Conservation Practice Standard: Contour Farming.\\" Code 330. June 2007.NRCS. National Conservation Practice Standard: Mulching.\\" Code 484. September 2008. Conservation tillage is a concept used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process. Nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer; animal manure; or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from crop residues, irrigation water, wildlife, and atmospheric deposition. Farmers can develop and implement nutrient management plans to reduce excess application of nutrients.NRCS. \\"National Conservation Practice Standard: Nutrient Management.\\" Code 590. August 2006. To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques (which can include biological pest control) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.NRCS. National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management.\\" Code 595. July 2008.EPA. \\"Integrated Pest Management Principles.\\" March 13, 2008. Forestry operations With a well- planned placement of both logging trails, also called skid trails, can reduce the amount of sediment generated. By planning the trails location as far away from the logging activity as possible as well as contouring the trails with the land, it can reduce the amount of loose sediment in the runoff. Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment. Marinas Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water.

The LOESS curve approximates the original sine wave. Local regression or local polynomial regression, also known as moving regression, is a generalization of moving average and polynomial regression. Its most common methods, initially developed for scatterplot smoothing, are LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing), both pronounced . They are two strongly related non-parametric regression methods that combine multiple regression models in a k-nearest- neighbor-based meta-model. Outside econometrics, LOESS is known and commonly referred to as Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter (proposed 15 years before LOESS). LOESS and LOWESS thus build on \\"classical\\" methods, such as linear and nonlinear least squares regression. They address situations in which the classical procedures do not perform well or cannot be effectively applied without undue labor. LOESS combines much of the simplicity of linear least squares regression with the flexibility of nonlinear regression. It does this by fitting simple models to localized subsets of the data to build up a function that describes the deterministic part of the variation in the data, point by point. In fact, one of the chief attractions of this method is that the data analyst is not required to specify a global function of any form to fit a model to the data, only to fit segments of the data. The trade-off for these features is increased computation. Because it is so computationally intensive, LOESS would have been practically impossible to use in the era when least squares regression was being developed. Most other modern methods for process modeling are similar to LOESS in this respect. These methods have been consciously designed to use our current computational ability to the fullest possible advantage to achieve goals not easily achieved by traditional approaches. A smooth curve through a set of data points obtained with this statistical technique is called a loess curve, particularly when each smoothed value is given by a weighted quadratic least squares regression over the span of values of the y-axis scattergram criterion variable. When each smoothed value is given by a weighted linear least squares regression over the span, this is known as a lowess curve; however, some authorities treat lowess and loess as synonyms. Model definition In 1964, Savitsky and Golay proposed a method equivalent to LOESS, which is commonly referred to as Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter. William S. Cleveland rediscovered the method in 1979 and gave it a distinct name. The method was further developed by Cleveland and Susan J. Devlin (1988). LOWESS is also known as locally weighted polynomial regression. At each point in the range of the data set a low-degree polynomial is fitted to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fitted using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the regression function for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point. The LOESS fit is complete after regression function values have been computed for each of the n data points. Many of the details of this method, such as the degree of the polynomial model and the weights, are flexible. The range of choices for each part of the method and typical defaults are briefly discussed next. Localized subsets of data The subsets of data used for each weighted least squares fit in LOESS are determined by a nearest neighbors algorithm. A user-specified input to the procedure called the \\"bandwidth\\" or \\"smoothing parameter\\" determines how much of the data is used to fit each local polynomial. The smoothing parameter, \\\\alpha, is the fraction of the total number n of data points that are used in each local fit. The subset of data used in each weighted least squares fit thus comprises the n\\\\alpha points (rounded to the next largest integer) whose explanatory variables' values are closest to the point at which the response is being estimated.NIST, \\"LOESS (aka LOWESS)\\", section 4.1.4.4, NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods, (accessed 14 April 2017) Since a polynomial of degree k requires at least (k+1) points for a fit, the smoothing parameter \\\\alpha must be between \\\\left(\\\\lambda+1\\\\right)/n and 1, with \\\\lambda denoting the degree of the local polynomial. \\\\alpha is called the smoothing parameter because it controls the flexibility of the LOESS regression function. Large values of \\\\alpha produce the smoothest functions that wiggle the least in response to fluctuations in the data. The smaller \\\\alpha is, the closer the regression function will conform to the data. Using too small a value of the smoothing parameter is not desirable, however, since the regression function will eventually start to capture the random error in the data. Degree of local polynomials The local polynomials fit to each subset of the data are almost always of first or second degree; that is, either locally linear (in the straight line sense) or locally quadratic. Using a zero degree polynomial turns LOESS into a weighted moving average. Higher-degree polynomials would work in theory, but yield models that are not really in the spirit of LOESS. LOESS is based on the ideas that any function can be well approximated in a small neighborhood by a low- order polynomial and that simple models can be fit to data easily. High-degree polynomials would tend to overfit the data in each subset and are numerically unstable, making accurate computations difficult. Weight function As mentioned above, the weight function gives the most weight to the data points nearest the point of estimation and the least weight to the data points that are furthest away. The use of the weights is based on the idea that points near each other in the explanatory variable space are more likely to be related to each other in a simple way than points that are further apart. Following this logic, points that are likely to follow the local model best influence the local model parameter estimates the most. Points that are less likely to actually conform to the local model have less influence on the local model parameter estimates. The traditional weight function used for LOESS is the tri-cube weight function, :w(x) = (1 - d^3)^3 where d is the distance of a given data point from the point on the curve being fitted, scaled to lie in the range from 0 to 1. However, any other weight function that satisfies the properties listed in Cleveland (1979) could also be used. The weight for a specific point in any localized subset of data is obtained by evaluating the weight function at the distance between that point and the point of estimation, after scaling the distance so that the maximum absolute distance over all of the points in the subset of data is exactly one. Consider the following generalisation of the linear regression model with a metric w(x,z) on the target space \\\\mathbb R^m that depends on two parameters, x,z\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^n. Assume that the linear hypothesis is based on n input parameters and that, as customary in these cases, we embed the input space \\\\mathbb R^n into \\\\mathbb R^{n+1} as x\\\\mapsto \\\\hat x := (1,x), and consider the following loss function :\\\\operatorname{RSS}_x(A) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i-A\\\\hat x_i)^Tw_i(x)(y_i-A\\\\hat x_i). Here, A is an (n+1)\\\\times(n+1) real matrix of coefficients, w_i(x):=w(x_i,x) and the subscript i enumerates input and output vectors from a training set. Since w is a metric, it is a symmetric, positive- definite matrix and, as such, there is another symmetric matrix h such that w=h^2. The above loss function can be rearranged into a trace by observing that y^Twy = (hy)^T(hy) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(hyy^Th) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(wyy^T). By arranging the vectors y_i and \\\\hat x_i into the columns of a m\\\\times N matrix Y and an (n+1)\\\\times N matrix \\\\hat X respectively, the above loss function can then be written as :\\\\operatorname{Tr}(W(x)(Y-A\\\\hat X)^T(Y-A\\\\hat X)) where W is the square diagonal N\\\\times N matrix whose entries are the w_i(x)s. Differentiating with respect to A and setting the result equal to 0 one finds the extremal matrix equation :A\\\\hat XW(x)\\\\hat X^T = YW(x)\\\\hat X^T. Assuming further that the square matrix \\\\hat XW(x)\\\\hat X^T is non-singular, the loss function \\\\operatorname{RSS}_x(A) attains its minimum at :A(x) = YW(x)\\\\hat X^T(\\\\hat XW(x)\\\\hat X^T)^{-1}. A typical choice for w(x,z) is the Gaussian weight :w(x,z) = \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{(x-z)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right) Advantages As discussed above, the biggest advantage LOESS has over many other methods is the process of fitting a model to the sample data does not begin with the specification of a function. Instead the analyst only has to provide a smoothing parameter value and the degree of the local polynomial. In addition, LOESS is very flexible, making it ideal for modeling complex processes for which no theoretical models exist. These two advantages, combined with the simplicity of the method, make LOESS one of the most attractive of the modern regression methods for applications that fit the general framework of least squares regression but which have a complex deterministic structure. Although it is less obvious than for some of the other methods related to linear least squares regression, LOESS also accrues most of the benefits typically shared by those procedures. The most important of those is the theory for computing uncertainties for prediction and calibration. Many other tests and procedures used for validation of least squares models can also be extended to LOESS models . Disadvantages LOESS makes less efficient use of data than other least squares methods. It requires fairly large, densely sampled data sets in order to produce good models. This is because LOESS relies on the local data structure when performing the local fitting. Thus, LOESS provides less complex data analysis in exchange for greater experimental costs. Another disadvantage of LOESS is the fact that it does not produce a regression function that is easily represented by a mathematical formula. This can make it difficult to transfer the results of an analysis to other people. In order to transfer the regression function to another person, they would need the data set and software for LOESS calculations. In nonlinear regression, on the other hand, it is only necessary to write down a functional form in order to provide estimates of the unknown parameters and the estimated uncertainty. Depending on the application, this could be either a major or a minor drawback to using LOESS. In particular, the simple form of LOESS can not be used for mechanistic modelling where fitted parameters specify particular physical properties of a system. Finally, as discussed above, LOESS is a computationally intensive method (with the exception of evenly spaced data, where the regression can then be phrased as a non-causal finite impulse response filter). LOESS is also prone to the effects of outliers in the data set, like other least squares methods. There is an iterative, robust version of LOESS [Cleveland (1979)] that can be used to reduce LOESS' sensitivity to outliers, but too many extreme outliers can still overcome even the robust method.

History Hurricane Katrina devastated Salmen, pushing a storm surge of over eight feet through the area. All the buildings were devastated, with the exception of the new science wing, which was part of the original building. After the storm, the school was closed for just over a month, but on 3 October 2005, Salmen started a platooning schedule at Northshore High School, which was mostly untouched by the storm. Northshore students attended from 6:55 a.m. to 12:35 p.m., and Salmen attended from 1:25 p.m. to 6:55 p.m. In mid January, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's assessment showed that more than 51% of the Salmen campus was damaged beyond repair, meaning that everything except the science building would have to be demolished and rebuilt. The new school was completed in the summer of 2010 and in August, the staff moved into the new building permanently. On 17 January 2006, Salmen moved into the rebuilt St. Tammany Jr. High School, and is intended to finish the year there. A temporary school is being built for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Before the storm, Salmen had just over 1000 students. As of 21 February 2006 about 800 of them have returned. The new school was completed in 2010 and is elevated 15ft to feature tuck-under parking.

American soldiers seized 15 kg of explosives, sniper rifles, grenades and maps of Kirkuk, with circles drawn around positions near the governor's building when they raided Turkish offices in Sulaimaniya. The soldiers were released after sixty hours, after Turkey protested to the United States. A Kurdish intelligence official claimed that the Turkish soldiers had been linked to a plot to assassinate the newly elected governor of Kirkuk to destabilise the region so that Turkish forces would be needed to restore order. Though neither side ever apologized, a US-Turkish commission set up to investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret. In addition, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote a letter to the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan expressing sorrow over the incident.Abundance of 'Rumsfeld letters' in Turkish press H√ºrriyet Daily News, 7/20/2003 The Hood event damaged diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States and marked a low point in US-Turkish relations. While the incident received comparatively little coverage in the United States, it was a major event in Turkey, many of whose citizens saw it as a deliberate insult and nicknamed it \\"The Hood event\\". Background A map of the Kurdish- inhabited areas of Iraq bordering Turkey. Turkey had long viewed northern Iraq, with its large mountain ranges, as a possible national security threat. During the 1980s and 1990s, Turkey fought against PKK, operating mainly in southeastern Turkey. More than 30,000 people were killed and millions more were displaced. During the war, the PKK established bases in Iraq and Syria. Turkish fears intensified after Iraqi Kurdistan gained autonomy after the 1991 Gulf War. In 1996, after a civil war had broken out there, Turkey deployed troops there to monitor a ceasefire between the two main Kurdish factions. In 1998, Turkey was able to use military threats to force neighboring Syria to expel PKK leader Abdullah √ñcalan. However, because of the United States, it was never able to move decisively against the PKK in northern Iraq. Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan had evolved into a semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq. The Iraq War By 2003, many Turks had come to see American foreign policy in the region as a threat. The election in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) gave hopes that relations could be improved, especially given AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan's positive comments regarding the US-Turkish cooperation in the Middle East, specifically concerning the so-called \\"Greater Middle East Project\\". Shortly after the election of the AKP tensions with America increased however, due to the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members. Although more than half of AKP members voted to authorize the troop deployment, a significant minority of the AKP along with almost all of the main opposition CHP voted against it. It was considered Erdogan's first significant political defeat as part of the AKP given his vocal support for the authorization before the vote. On April 24, 2003, only two weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing civilian clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group. Colonel Bill Mayville, a U.S. brigade commander who was responsible for the region where this took place, accused the Turks of having links to the Iraqi Turkoman Front (ITF), an ethnic-Turkish militia. However, US forces made no effort to incarcerate the Turks, merely detaining them for a day, with food, security and comfort, and then escorting them back to the Iraqi-Turkish border. In the following months, Turkey continued its policy of sending small groups of soldiers into Iraqi Kurdistan, ostensibly to search for PKK bases. According to The Economist, Turkey also began covertly arming the ITF as a lever against the PKK. Raid on Al Sulaymaniyah On July 4, 2003, soldiers from the United States Army's 173d Airborne Brigade raided a safehouse in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaymaniyah. Seemingly acting on an intelligence tip that there were individuals in the safehouse plotting to assassinate the Iraqi-Kurdish governor of the province of Kirkuk. The safehouse instead housed members of the Iraq's Turkoman Front and Turkish Special Forces soldiers, including a colonel and two majors, whom they promptly arrested. Turkish sources refer to eleven soldiers commanded by a major. An unknown number of other individuals were also detained during the raid, although thirteen were later released. Apart from these, and the Turkish soldiers who were to be released after intense diplomatic activity, a British citizen named Michael Todd, who was in the area looking for his girlfriend and their 19-month-old daughter, was also taken into custody. Negotiations The Turkish military immediately threatened retaliatory measures, including closing Turkish airspace to US military flights, stopping the use of the southern Incirlik Air Base and sending more troops into northern Iraq. A delegation of Turkish military and diplomatic officials immediately left for Sulaymaniyah on Saturday to discuss the matter with the Americans, but according to the Turks most of the American commanders were off celebrating Independence Day. Following direct protests by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan to US Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as by Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah G√ºl to US Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Turkish soldiers were released after sixty hours in captivity. Aftermath On 2003-07-24, G√ºl and Rumsfeld met at the Pentagon. The Hood event made a much greater impact in Turkey than in the West, which by and large agreed with the U.S. government's interpretation. While the story received comparatively little coverage outside of the Middle East, Turkish newspapers loudly condemned the raid, referring to U.S. forces with nicknames such as \\"Rambos\\" and \\"Ugly Americans\\". On the last day of the incident, Hilmi √ñzk√∂k, Chief of the General Staff (Turkey), declared that the Hood event had caused a \\"crisis of confidence\\" between the US and Turkey. The event periodically gets front coverage in the Turkish media, such as in the mass- circulation daily H√ºrriyet, in keeping with new declarations made to the press by the involved parties and new details divulged. Most recently, the key witness in the Ergenekon investigation, Tuncay G√ºney, alleged that the event was the U.S. response to the discovery of documents about the clandestine Ergenekon network's Iraq connection in the archives of Tariq Aziz. The Hood event was the inspiration for the 2006 Turkish action film Valley of the Wolves Iraq. The film opens with the depiction of an almost identical incident, following afterwards a fictional story in which the Turkish protagonist seeks retaliation against the American commander responsible for the incident. Claims Various municipal and government buildings were set on fire in Mosul and Kirkuk by Kurdish forces on 10 and 11 April 2003. A Turkish daily newspaper reported that the Turkish Special Forces soldiers, who were captured by US Army and Peshmerga, had already filmed the deed records and sent the digital records to Turkey before the historical records were terminated. The newspaper also reported that the US party was, in fact, in search of those records, but they were unable to find them. However, Turkish Ministry of Public Works declared that the ministry archives holds historical deed records from the Ottoman era and there were no operations involved. Retired Department of Intelligence Chief of General Staff of the Republic of Turkey, Korg. ƒ∞smail Hakki Pekin, claims in his book named \\"Dikkat Cemaat √áƒ±kabilir KOZMƒ∞K ODA\\" that, after the secret archives about Turkmens captured during the raid, local Turkmen leaders were assassinated or died in suspicious traffic accidents.

Its ancestors had migrated into Michigan and Ohio in the 18th century. In the late 1830s they were removed to west of the Mississippi River, first to Iowa, then to Kansas in what was then Indian Territory. In 1867 they sold their land to purchase territory in what became Oklahoma, then primarily settled by Native Americans. The other three tribes are located in the state of Michigan, part of the traditional Odawa territory. They are the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. In addition, there are First Nations of Odawa people in Ontario, Canada, including on Manitoulin Island, their original homeland. Government The headquarters of the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma is Miami. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Ottawa County. In the early 21st century, there are 2,500 enrolled tribal members; 737 live within the state of Oklahoma. The tribe bases membership qualifications on direct lineal descent; that is, they have no minimum blood quantum requirement.

The French quickly realized how influential they were and used them as middlemen to the tribes to the north and west of them, who supplied them with furs from the 17th well into the 18th century. The Ottawa are part of the Three Fires Confederacy, together with the Ojibwe and Potawatomi. The Oklahoma Ottawa are descended from Ottawa bands that moved south from Manitoulin Island and the Bruce Peninsula, both in Ontario, Canada,Lovett, John R. Ottawa.

They settled near Fort Detroit and the Maumee River in Ohio. They were pressured to move again by the United States, after Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to make land exchanges with Native American tribes in order to remove them from east of the Mississippi River and extinguish their land titles there. The Ottawa of the Blanchard's Fork, Roche de B≈ìuf and Auglaize reserves of Ohio signed a treaty with the US in 1833. The treaty ceded their lands in Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois in exchange for lands in Iowa, then Kansas, part of what was known as Indian Territory under the federal government's plan. The Ottawa did not relocate from Ohio until April 1837. Of the 600 Ottawa who emigrated to Kansas, \\"more than 300 died within the first two years, because of exposure, lack of proper food, and the great difference between the cool, damp woods of Ohio and the dry, hot plains of Kansas.\\"Abel, Anna Louise. \\"Indian Reservations in Kansas and the Extinguishment of their Title\\", Kansas State Historical Society 1902, p. 80 To survive as a people, the tribe made a remarkable investment in their children's future. Of the the Ottawa controlled in Kansas, they set aside for an upper-level school and sold of land to fund its construction and maintenance. Affiliated with the Baptist Church, which operated missions in Kansas, Ottawa University educated both Indians and non- Indians. The university still offers free tuition to any enrolled member of the Ottawa tribe today.Miller, Scott C. \\"Ottawa Tribe and Ottawa University Sign New Agreement for Education\\" , Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma. 21 Oct 2008 (accessed 16 Feb 2009). The present-day town of Ottawa, Kansas, developed around the Ottawa Reservation. The Ottawa people remained in Kansas until 1867, after the American Civil War. Under the leadership of Chief John Wilson, the tribe sold their lands in Kansas and purchased of land in Indian Territory from the Eastern Shawnee. More of the tribe died during relocation and only 200 Ottawa arrived in their new lands. Two decades later, Congress passed the Dawes Act of 1887, designed to encourage Native American assimilation by having households establish subsistence farming in the European-American model. It dissolved the communal tribal lands and governments, and required communal lands to be divided and allocated in 160-acre plots to individual households of registered members of each tribe in the Indian Territory. The land was so poor in many areas that this amount of farmland proved insufficient even for subsistence farming. In 1891, 157 Ottawa were finally allotted plots of land in Indian Territory; under provisions of the law, the US federal government declared the remainder of their land as surplus and sold it, primarily to non-native buyers. The Dawes Rolls are records for each tribe of their members registered at that time. A number of tribes use the Dawes Rolls as a basis for establishing membership in their tribes at a particular time. In 1936 the Ottawa tribe in Oklahoma organized their government again under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act and gained federal recognition as a tribe. This entitled them to certain benefits in education, for instance. But in the 1950s federal policy changed again, and Congress decided it was time to encourage tribes to give up their special status in relation to the federal government. Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs determined that some tribes were ready to be terminated; that is, their special status would end and their citizens would be considered simply US citizens. The Ottawa of Oklahoma were one of the tribes whose federally recognized government was terminated in 1956. This deprived them of benefits needed in the harsh environment of Oklahoma, and disrupted their society. The tribe persevered to regain their status; federal recognition was restored under a bill signed by President Jimmy Carter on May 15, 1978. In 1979 the US Congress recognized the tribal council and ratified the tribal constitution. In 1980 the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians gained federal recognition. In 1994 two more tribes of Odawa people in Michigan gained federal recognition: the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. There are also status bands of First Nations of Odawa peoples on Manitoulin Island and in other areas of Ontario, Canada. The Ottawa Tribe serves free lunches for elders in the town of Miami.

The tribe is made up of Otoe and Missouria Indians. Traditionally they spoke the Chiwere language, part of the Siouan language family. History The Otoe, or Oto, and Missouria, or Missouri, tribes both originated in the Great Lakes region. They are thought, along with the Ho- Chunk and Iowa tribes, to have once been a single tribe. In the 16th century, the Iowa, Otoe, and Missouria broke away from that tribe and moved to the south and west. By the late 17th century, the Missouria had settled near the Missouri and Grand Rivers in Missouri. Meanwhile, the Otoes settled along what is now the Iowa-Minnesota border. They first came into contact with Europeans in late 17th century. Jacques Marquette, the French explorer, included them in a 1673 map, placing the Otoe near the Des Moines and upper Iowa Rivers. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville wrote in 1700 that the Otoe and the Iowa lived with the Omaha tribe, between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.Oto Indian Tribe History. Access Genealogy: Indian Tribal Records. (retrieved 22 Feb 2009) After contact, they migrated to Nebraska and settled near the Platte River on what became the Otoe Reservation. The 18th century was devastating for the Missouria people. Smallpox killed many in the tribe, as did constant warfare with enemies, such as the Sac and Fox. In 1796, some surviving Missouria joined the Osage and Kaw tribes, while 80 Missouria joined the Otoe. In the 19th century, the Missouria and the Otoe established permanent villages consisting primarily of earth lodges, but also occasionally tipis and bark lodges. Their joined society was patrilineal and comprised seven to ten clans. Tribal members had to marry outside of their clan. Each clan had a leader, and together the clan chiefs formed a tribal council. The chief of the Bear Clan was the principal leader of the tribes. They hunted buffalo and grew such crops as squash, beans, corn, and pumpkins. In 1803, Lewis and Clark estimated their population to be 500. George Catlin estimated their population at 1200 in 1833. In 1830 there were an estimated 1500 Otoe‚ÄìMissouria living in together. By 1886, only 334 Otoe‚ÄìMissouria survived. The first land cession treaty between the Otoe‚ÄìMissouria and the United States was in 1830. These were followed by more treaties in 1833, 1836, and 1854. The 1854 Treaty established a reservation on the Kansas-Nebraska border, near the Big Blue River. The tribe split in factions of assimilationists and traditionalists. The assimilationist Otoe‚ÄìMissouria were influenced by Quaker missionaries and became known as the Quaker Band. The traditionalists were known as the Coyote Band. In 1876 Congress arranged the sale of of the Otoe‚ÄìMissouria reservation and sold the rest in 1881, when Congress forced the Otoe‚ÄìMissouria into Indian Territory. The Coyote Band settled on the Sac and Fox reservation, while the Quaker Band settled on their own small, reservation in present-day Noble and Pawnee Counties. The Coyote Band rejoined the Quaker Band, but their reservation was almost immediately broken up into individual allotments, as dictated by the Dawes Act, in the 1890s. A total of 514 Otoe‚ÄìMissourias received individual allotments. Much later, in the 1960s the Otoe‚ÄìMissouria people were compensated for their lands lost during the 19th century by the Indian Claims Commission. The tribe's constitution was ratified in 1984 in accordance with the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.

He won the Vasaloppet in 1980, and finished second in 1992. As a coach, he was banned from the 2006 and 2010 Olympics after blood transfusion equipment was found in a house used by Austrian skiers during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Mayer was accused of blood doping violations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the ban after a three- month investigation. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Mayer‚Äîwho had been spotted with the Austrian team despite his suspension‚Äîfled back to Austria after a surprise overnight raid on the quarters of the Austrian skiers by Italian police. He crashed his vehicle into a police roadblock, and was immediately relieved of his coaching duties by the Austrian Ski Federation. Police found syringes and a blood transfusion machine in the home where Mayer had been staying. Claiming that he was suicidal, Mayer entered a psychiatric hospital in Austria. In an interview with NEWS, an Austrian magazine, Mayer said he was trying to kill himself when he drove into the police roadblock. He pleaded guilty to charges of civil disorder, assault, and damage to property. In March 2006, Mayer filed defamation lawsuits against Dick Pound, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency and Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC. He withdrew both suits in February 2007. The IOC held hearings in April 2007 on allegations of doping by Austrian skiers at the 2006 games. On April 25 the hearings closed, resulting in the lifetime suspensions of six Austrian skiers. Banned as a result of the hearings were biathletes Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann as well as cross country skiers Martin Tauber, J√ºrgen Pinter, Johannes Eder and Roland Diethart. While the six will be unable to compete in any capacity at any future Olympic event, the ban does not affect non-Olympic sporting events. Mayer was arrested in Austria in March 2009 on suspicion of selling doping substances.

The character only appeared in the soap briefly in 1993, but was a feature in the programme until his body was discovered in 1995 in one of the most memorable storylines of its history. Background Trevor Jordache had been the head of the Jordache family prior to their arrival on Brookside Close. He worked in a management position for a building society and the family lived a comfortable lifestyle. Trevor, however, was a bully towards his wife Mandy (Sandra Maitland), whom he had married in 1973, and sexually abused his teenage daughter Beth (Anna Friel). He served a sentence for assaulting his wife, but he had not been reported for abusing Beth. Brookside Close In 1993 Mandy, Beth and Rachel Jordache (Tiffany Chapman) arrived on Brookside Close in a \\"safehouse\\", as Trevor was due to be released from prison. The family lived there for a short while before Trevor traced Beth at college. When Trevor approached her, she ran away, however she was followed home by Trevor revealing the family home on Brookside Close. Trevor then approached his wife Mandy. Mandy refused to take pity on him, however she agreed to meet him at his bedsit. Upon seeing the squalor he had to live in and finding he had been burgled, Mandy naively allowed Trevor to stay at her house, much to the delight of Rachel and the disgust of Beth. During his stay at the Jordache house, Trevor bullied and beat his wife Mandy, but was more cautious around Beth who showed open contempt for him. Beth was particularly cautious owing to her father's sexual abuse of her when she was younger. Fearing for Rachel's welfare, she kept an eye on her father. When she noticed that Trevor was abusing Rachel, she told Mandy. When Mandy confronted him, he told her that if she left he would kill her, their daughters and then himself. Later Trevor invited the neighbours around for a drinks party. Most of the neighbours gave false excuses, except for David (John Burgess) and Jean Crosbie (Marcia Ashton), who turned up out of sympathy for Mandy. During the party Trevor openly belittled Mandy, making the Crosbies feel uncomfortable and making them leave early. Trevor noticed this and was embarrassed. Blaming the incident on Mandy for allegedly badmouthing him to the neighbours, he viciously beat her. Beth's ultimatum On noticing her mother had been beaten by Trevor, Beth issued an ultimatum, telling her to throw Trevor out. Mandy refused, confessing to Beth that Trevor had threatened to kill them all should she do so. Upon realising this, Beth hatched a plan to kill Trevor involving her reluctant mother. Death Beth and a reluctant Mandy first tried to kill Trevor using weed-killer brought around by Sinbad (Michael Starke). When this failed, Beth started buying large amounts of pain-killers from Ron Dixon's (Vince Earl) shop and putting them into his food. This however only served to make Trevor ill. The pair persevered with this plan despite its failings, making Trevor more unwell each time. During their final attempt Trevor caught the pair putting the pain killers into his drink. After confronting them, Beth told Trevor she hated him and wished he was dead. Trevor blamed Beth for turning Mandy against him and beat her in the kitchen. Upon seeing her daughter being beaten, Mandy picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed Trevor with it, killing him. Trevor's body Once Mandy and Beth realised Trevor was dead, Mandy became very distant, but Beth hatched a plan to dispose of Trevor's body. When night fell the two wrapped him in bin liners and Beth buried him under the patio. Two years later however, an underground leak forced the area to be dug up and Trevor's body was found by Eddie Banks (Paul Broughton) and Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan). Reaction to the character The Trevor Jordache storyline was particularly successful and well received by critics. The story was the main storyline during the early-to-mid 1990s when the soap was at its peak of popularity. Today it is one of the best remembered storylines in the soap's history, along with Beth Jordache's lesbian kiss, Sheila Grant's (Sue Johnston) rape, the murder of Damon Grant (Simon O'Brien), the religious suicide pact involving Terry Sullivan (Brian Regan) and the incestuous relationship between siblings Nat (John Sandford) and Georgia Simpson (Helen Grace).

Schultze partnered with Michael Holm and the two produced numerous new-age albums. The two met in late 1970s, when they discovered that they shared a similar interest in pre-colonial America. Schultze also released a number of solo albums. Biography Kristian Schultze was the son of Norbert Schultze ‚Äî the composer of \\"Lili Marleen\\" ‚Äî and Iwa Wanja, a famous actress and singer in her time. He grew up in Hamburg, Rio de Janeiro and Berlin, and got his musical education at Konservatorium and Musikhochschule Berlin, Wiener Akademie and Jazzschool Graz. He moved to Munich in 1968 where he worked as composer, arranger, producer and musician for various artists, for movies, television and theater. As a keyboard player, he joined the group Passport of Klaus Doldinger in 1973 and recorded the albums \\"Looking Thru\\", \\"Cross Collateral\\", \\"Infinity Machine\\" and \\"Iguacu\\" with them. They undertook tours of Asia, United States, Australia and Brazil and Germany. In 1977, he left the band and played in the group \\"Snowball\\" with Curt Cress (drums), Dave King (bass guitar) and Roy Albrighton, the former lead singer with NEKTAR. In 1979, Kristian and Michael Holm started the studio project \\"Cusco\\". They produced 22 albums and semi-albums, and consistently charted near the top of the New Age charts. In 1985, he and his wife Birgid moved to the Bavarian countryside, where they rented a house in Bad T√∂lz, a small village facing the Bavarian Alps. He built his second D.I. studio in that house and continued to work as composer, arranger, sound designer and keyboard-soloist for dozens of national and international artists. From 1986, Kristian studied computer theory, learned some computer languages, and became a beta tester for software companies in Germany. Some of his ideas made their way into major studio programs like Notator. From 1988, Kristian practiced meditation techniques, and from 1990 until 1993 he was a student in breath therapy (HAKOMI method). Through the inspiration of his wife, who during the years has become a healing specialist, Kristian tried to integrate his experiences into his compositions. His last two solo albums, Colours of Inner Peace and Born to Breathe, both released 1996 under the GIB label, give examples of this new way of music writing, and his constant work with Michael Holm and Cusco also reflect some of these compositional developments. Kristian died of a heart attack in Bad T√∂lz, Bavaria, aged 66.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the crew of the USS Enterprise saves an isolated genetically engineered society from immediate destruction, the cultural contamination resulting from their interaction may still ultimately doom the colony. Plot The Enterprise has been assigned to the Moab sector to track a stellar core fragment from a disintegrated Neutron star. They find the fragment is due to pass near Moab IV, threatening a human colony on the planet. On contacting the colony to arrange for evacuation, its leader Aaron Conor (John Snyder) refuses, though allows an away team down to discuss the matter. Conor explains that the colony was formed 200 years prior to create a perfect society using genetic engineering and selective breeding, and he and the other leaders feel that evacuation would destroy the perfect order they have achieved. They discuss other alternatives and Enterprise Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge is introduced to Hannah Bates (Dey Young), a scientist. Bates proposes using a multi-phase tractor beam, powered by the Enterprises warp core, to push the fragment from its path, which La Forge agrees would be a possible solution. After some deliberation, Bates is allowed to leave the colony to the Enterprise to oversee the process. Meanwhile, Deanna Troi and Conor start to develop a romantic attraction as they try to convince the other leaders that evacuation is the best option. Aboard the Enterprise, Bates' solution is found to be effective, but the equipment required is damaged too quickly to be used. La Forge recognizes her solution could be augmented with similar technology that enables his VISOR to operate, allowing the equipment to last long enough to manipulate the fragment safely away from Moab IV. La Forge comments that this solution wouldn't be possible in the current colony's manner of perfection as imperfections like blindness would have been outright eliminated. As they continue simulations, they find that the solution is not perfect, but La Forge suggests that they reinforce the colony's shielding during the fragment's passing, allowing the colony to survive the fragment's passage. Conor initially refuses as this would require more Enterprise personnel to transport to the colony, and he fears cultural contamination, but relents when Troi convinces him this is the only solution. The Enterprise is able to push the fragment far enough that the colony appears to be safe. As the other Enterprise crew return to the ship, La Forge and Bates check on the status of the colony shielding. Bates reports there are microfractures that will soon fail, and recommends full evacuation. La Forge, having not seen these on his VISOR, recognizes that Bates falsified the readings, as she wishes to leave with the Enterprise, recognizing that the colony has languished behind the technological improvements of the Federation. Admitting her lie, she requests asylum aboard the Enterprise. Several other colonists express their desire to leave. Troi brings Captain Picard to the colony to discuss the matter with Conor. Though Picard recognizes that the colony's society will be altered by agreeing to asylum, he cannot refuse this request as a fundamental right of human free will. Conor reluctantly agrees, and allows Bates and 22 other colonists to leave with the ship. As they leave orbit, Picard comments how this affair is a clear example of the necessity of the Prime Directive; the intervention of the Federation to save the colonists may have, in the end, proved just as dangerous to the colony as any core fragment could ever have been. Reception In 2011, this episode was mentioned by Forbes in a review of Star Trek episodes that explore the implications of advanced technology, and this episode was noted for a depiction of a \\"genetically engineered society\\".

The animated short was directed by Bill Roberts and animated by Al Eugster, Shamus Culhane, Fred Moore, John Lounsbery, Norm Ferguson, and Leo Salkin. The film originally released on February 3, 1939.\\"Society Dog Show\\". www.bcdb.com It was the 104th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the first for that year. In the short, Pluto's romantic partner is Fifi, a Pekignese who also appears in Puppy Love (1933), Pluto's Quin-puplets (1937) and Mickey's Surprise Party (1939). Synopsis Mickey Mouse enters Pluto in a ritzy dog show. The two arrive there in a makeshift wooden car. While Mickey grooms Pluto, Pluto starts swooning over Fifi the Peke. When Pluto is called to the judge's stand, Mickey quickly retrieves him. Things don't look good for Mickey and Pluto after he attacks the judge, resulting in the two getting kicked out. Upon hearing trick dogs coming onstage to perform, Mickey decides to reenter Pluto in the dog show as a trick dog, but Pluto is worried about the idea. When a photographer attempts to take a picture of the trick dogs, the camera's flash powder ignites a curtain, causing a fire to break out in the building. Fifi gets stuck under a fallen microphone stand. As Mickey is about to go back in with Pluto as a roller skating dog, a crowd of people and dogs run out. Pluto hears Fifi and bravely goes in, still wearing his roller skates. Mickey tries to follow, but is stopped by falling debris. After hitting a column and narrowly avoiding a collapsing part of the floor and a falling wall, Pluto skates his way across wooden beams and saves Fifi just before the floor that she's on gives way. They escape the burning building by crashing through a window and land on a drain pipe that folds down like a spring and launches them out onto the street. Mickey and the others gather around Pluto and the judge awards Pluto with a medal as everyone cheers for him, hailing him as a hero. Pluto then uses his ear to pull Fifi behind the medal, presumably sharing a kiss. Notes * The cartoon is notable in that it was the last appearance of Mickey's older character design, primarily the dotted eyes in the design. * There was later a comic strip based on this short by Floyd Gottfredson although the comic strip was portrayed quite differently than the cartoon.

Meine Liebe has been adapted into an anime series produced in 2004 by the studio Bee Train, which was broadcast across Japan by the anime television network, Animax. In 2006 a sequel was produced by the name of , which was also broadcast across Japan by Animax. The story follows the lives of students at an elite academy of the fictional European country of Kuchen in 1937. Other adaptations consist of a four volume Meine Liebe manga and a novel; as well, several drama CDs have been released. Settings The entire story takes place in a country called Kuchen, a fictional country located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the coasts of France and south of Britannia.Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 1 The word \\"kuchen\\" is the German word for \\"cake\\", and most of the places and people are also German-based. Other notable cities are Kirsche (\\"cherry\\"), Erdbeere (\\"strawberry\\") and M√ºrbe (\\"shortcrust\\"). Kuchen is a monarchy. The king of Kuchen decided that his country would not get involved in the disheveled politics of a world between two world wars. The king is aided by several scholars with strong backgrounds and logical minds, who earned recognition from the Kuchen church. They are men with a noble rank who graduated from the prestigious Rosenstolz academy. Rosenstolz (German for \\"pride of the rose\\") academy is a boarding school which students from wealthy families attend. The academy is open to all genders, though only the boys have a dorm on the academy's ground. Rosenstolz is located in a peaceful town, though its grounds stretch over parts of the surrounding wilderness and forest. The gardens are well tended, consisting of a flourishing greenhouse, stables and narrow channels and fountains. It is known that the students in Rosenstolz are expected to learn fencing, horseback riding, world history and Kuchen history, science and languages.Meine Leibe Season 2, episode 2 The academy has one special class that's called the Strahl candidate's class (Strahl being German for ray), where all the prominent young men study hard in the hopes of becoming the king's councilors. Until headmaster Werner's reform, only those who were born to the right social class could study there. The academy is said to welcome everyone. Amongst the academy's alumni are the current headmaster Bartholomew,Meine Leibe Season 2, episode 12 councilor Gerald,Meine Leibe Season 2, episode 1 Victor Gryffith,Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 3 Josef TorgerMeine Leibe Season 1, episode 10 and the king. It is known that Beruze and headmaster Werner did not go to Rosenstolz.Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 13 Story The main hero of the anime is Orpherus, a young man who believes in a country ruled by its peopleMeine Leibe Season 1, episode 6 and whose older sister was killed in an act of terrorism two years prior. Orpherus (nicknamed Orphe) is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true ‚Äî being the king's advisers. First season The first season begins by introducing the characters, their past and their ambitions. Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Ludwig and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rosenstolz academy and a part of the Strahl class ‚Äì a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen. Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threaten to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king. Second season The five Strahl candidates return to their final year in Rosenstolz, but troubles are far from over. The previous headmaster disappears without saying a word and the new headmaster has a revolutionary idea that threatens to tear the academy apart. But there are troubles not only inside the academy. The king is hiding information, Lui's mother is depressed and Lui himself is being accused of severe treason. While on the run Orphe is nearly shot once again, and Ed finds out that figures from their past have once again arrived at Kuchen. Now the five of them must prove Lui's innocence while stopping a hideous ploy to sell Kuchen to foreign hands. Main characters ; :Orpherus is nicknamed Orphe by most of the people around him. His title F√ºrst, means he is a prince, but neither the anime nor the manga show that he is really royalty and therefore suggest he is the ruler of a \\"principality\\" royal and noble ranks as in German custom. Orphe is not the son of a king called a \\"Prinz\\" (prince) in German he is called \\"F√ºrst\\"(prince)indicating his place as the first of his house, as his parents do not appear and he is the presumed head and \\"first\\" of his house. The household employs a butler and Orphe had an older sister named Robertine, who died when he was 15. Orphe was devastated after her death, and has the habit of caressing the pendant that Robertine's fianc√© gave her and which Orphe took from the rubble of the explosion site. He blames himself for not accompanying her to buy the wedding dress, despite the fact that she insisted on going alone. :Orphe is a very idealistic person. Isaac reprimands him on this, saying that he is unconnected to today's society and that words alone would not stifle the sparks of war. According to his way of thinking it can be said that he is also an idealist. He likes politics and holds women in higher regards than most of the men in his time. He's prone to winning and strives to excel in everything he does. He decided to become a Strahl candidate after meeting the king as a boy.Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 8 ; , Drama voice by: Shotaro Morikubo :Eduard is nicknamed \\"Ed\\" by most of the people around him. His title, Markgraf means Marquis. His father had an illegal affair with a woman of a lower rank, resulting in Ed and Erika (Ed's little sister). After his mother died, his father took him into his house. However, he was already married with three girls, all of whom were older than Ed. Henriette Braunschweig, Ed's stepmother, hated Ed because she wasn't able to give birth to a male heir to the Braunschweig family assets, going as far as telling her daughters not to speak with their two half siblings. Eventually Ed's father had Erika removed from the house to appease his wife, and her whereabouts are unknown. Ed is still burdened by this because he had promised his sister that he would protect her, and was unable to fulfill that promise.Meine Leibe Season 2, episode 5 :Ed's appearance is unlike that of the other nobles in the series. He goes with his neck uncovered, he is more tanned than the others and has an earring. Ed is very cheerful and likes to take things easy. He is also the comic relief throughout the series, with his attempts at meditation and kendo.Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 5 He makes friends easily and wears his heart on his sleeve, though he does not care what other people think about him. He is a good swordsman but is not above using his fists in a fight, another thing that distinguishes him from the other nobles. ; , Drama voice by: Akira Ishida :Ludwig is often nicknamed as Lui by the people around him, though most still refer to him as Ludwig because they are afraid of him or revere him. His title Herzog is the second highest title among the nobles, and means Duke. His father is a Duke as well, but his mother is the king's sister, making the king of Kuchen his uncle. His other uncle on his mother's side is the king's (rebellious) younger brother, Helbert. His uncle on his father's side is Camus' father, making the two of them cousins. It is known that he has two housekeepers named Augusta and Clemence, a younger sister and a younger brother. Also, he is left-handed. :Lui appears cold-hearted most of the time. He is very arrogant and yet he knows what is expected of him by his rank and position in the world of those times, and accepts it with cold indifference. He often leaves his friend shocked at his words when he voices his thoughts. However, Lui is a good judge of character and seems to know what to say to help the people he is fond of in order to solve problems on their own. He likes challenges, as long as they are fair towards both ends. Lui claims that he is not like the others, insinuating that he is cold hearted and calculated, and compares himself to Orphe by saying that he can not grasp an opportunity and fight for it like Orphe does. Isaac reprimands Lui for his way of thinking, claiming that it was too dangerous. ; , Drama voice by: K≈çki Miyata :Camus does not have a nickname like the others, but due to Japanese pronunciation it is often thought that he is nicknamed \\"Camu\\", however that is not so. Camus‚Äô rank of Pfalzgraf is the lowest of the nobles and means Count palatine. Camus has an elder sister and an elder brother named Leohart, who is especially protective of him and has watched over him ever since the day he was born.Meine Leibe Season 2, episode 6 :Camus possesses a special ability, something akin to empathy. He is able to talk to flowers and under his care they bloom more wildly than any place else (his mansion consists of huge gardens that he tend to himself). This ability also enables him to tell a person‚Äôs mood. He can tell when someone is upset or angry, like he knew that Isaac was angry at the Strahl class when he visited the academy even though Isaac was smiling. He also receives visions of future events, but when he warns the people involved he is usually feared instead of heeded. Due to this ability he is often feared, misunderstood or mocked. ; , Drama voice by: Tomokazu Sugita :Naoji is the only one who does not have a rank, and is in fact not a noble. Naoji was born in Japan to a prestigious family. His father sent him to Kuchen to turn him into an educated and experienced man, but also to protect him from the impending war in Japan (World War II). Without his knowledge, a Kuchen citizenship application was submitted in his name by his father, something he is very upset over. He is staying with a man named Foster, who was like a father to Naoji‚Äôs mother.Meine Leibe Season 1, episode 4 :Naoji has a younger sister, a grandfather and a non-Japanese grandmother. His grandmother was born in Kuchen to a Dukedom and was described to be a true lady with perfect education. She met Naoji‚Äôs grandfather when he was studying abroad and all but eloped with him to Japan. Throughout the anime series, Naoji is the only one who speaks the common Japanese dialect, while the rest of the characters speak in an extremely polite and somewhat archaic dialect to distinguish between them. ; :Isaac is a British spy who works undercover in Kuchen. Since Kuchen insisted on remaining neutral despite the time and era being just between two world wars, the British government wanted to know if Kuchen can be influenced (by force if necessary) to support their side. So Isaac is sent, and for nearly a year he works in Kuchen in the disguise of an author, though he is not the only secret agent who works undercover in Kuchen. :Isaac actually received the title \\"Sir\\" for his service to his country. His parents were fallen noblemen that, due to poverty, were thrown out of their manor, something that affected his sister very much. He has three younger siblings: a sister named Rosa and two younger brothers. At some point after they were thrown out of their manor Isaac was left to take care of his younger siblings and was separated from his parents. He joined the army to earn money and support the family during World War I (he calls that time \\"hell\\"), and due to his outstanding conduct in battle was recruited to the secret services. :Isaac has a motorcycle and usually carries a revolver. Also, he seems to have strange connections with some of the alumni of Rosenstolz academy.

He served as the most senior officer in the Criminal Investigation Division, and was also the top Army Law Enforcement officer as the Army Provost Marshal General. Taguba Report In 2003 Ryder conducted an inquiry into abuse of prisoners in Iraq, cited in the Taguba Report. Some of the key recommendations of Ryder's report were directly contrary to the recommendations of Major General Geoffrey Miller, formerly the commander of Camp Delta. Ryder recommended that the duties of the military police who guarded detainees should be strictly separated from the duties of the Military Intelligence officers who interrogated them. General Miller had urged closer cooperation between guards and interrogators. Miller had recommended that guards \\"set the conditions\\" for successful interrogation‚Äîa vague term that some critics believe was the trigger for some of the abuse some guards later committed. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's response to the public release of the news of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse was to ignore Ryder and Taguba's recommendations and appoint General Miller to take over direction of the prison facilities in Iraq. Ryder also oversaw the organization and operations of the DoD Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) which conducted terrorism investigations. Ryder retired in 2007.

The fire was started deliberately by a security guard working in the supermarket, who was sentenced to 7 years. Staple Hill supermarket fire Fleur Lombard was one of only eight women among Avon's 700 firefighters. On graduating in 1994, Lombard received the Silver Axe Award, for most outstanding recruit on her training school. On 4 February 1996, when she was 21 years old, she was fighting a supermarket fire in Staple Hill, near Bristol, when she and her partner, Robert Seaman, were caught in a flashover. She was killed as a direct result of the intense heat and her body was found just a few yards from the exit. Lombard was the first female firefighter to die in peacetime service in Britain. Posthumously, she was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. Robert Seaman was awarded the George Medal for bravery for returning to the burning building when he realised his partner had not followed him out. Another firefighter, Pat Foley, who also went into the blazing supermarket to help, was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery. Martin Cody The fire was deliberately started by security guard Martin Cody, then aged 21, on his first day at work at the supermarket. Cody was said to live in a fantasy world and started the fire to relieve his boredom. He phoned a colleague to say the fire was \\"a good one\\", and was seen punching the air with glee before firefighters arrived on the scene. Cody was later jailed for seven-and-a-half years for manslaughter and arson. The sentencing judge of the Royal Courts of Justice stated that he had escaped a life sentence for the manslaughter only because psychiatrists were unable to say he posed a continuing serious risk to the public. Lombard's parents criticised the jail sentence, saying psychiatric treatment would have been more appropriate. Legacy Lombard's funeral service was held on 14 February 1996, at Derby Cathedral. She was cremated and her ashes were later interred in the churchyard of St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick, Cornwall. A trust fund and bursary were set up in her memory. A memorial plaque stands close to where Lombard died. Her name is on the UK National Firefighters Memorial located near St. Paul's Cathedral, London. In her memory, Avon Fire and Rescue Service have set up the Fleur Lombard Bursary Fund. This provides travel grants so that a junior UK firefighter may visit the fire service of another country. On 15 May 2019, Great Western Railway named a Class 800 intercity express train (IET), No. 800023, in her honour.

The gland's function is similar to that of the kidneys, though it is much more efficient at removing salt, allowing penguins to survive without access to fresh water. Contrary to popular belief, the gland does not directly convert saltwater to freshwater. The term supraorbital refers to the area just above the eye socket (which is known as the orbit). Living in saltwater environments would naturally pose a large problem for penguins because the ingestion of saltwater would be detrimental to a penguin's health. Although penguins do not directly drink water, it is taken in when they engulf prey. As a result, saltwater enters their system and must be effectively excreted. The supraorbital gland has thus enabled the penguins' survival in such environments due to its water-filtering capability. The gland is located just above the eyes and surrounds a capillary bed in the head. This capillary bed constantly strains out the salt in the saltwater that a penguin takes in. Since the byproduct of the gland has roughly five times as much salt as would normally be found in the animal's fluids, the supraorbital gland is highly efficient. The penguin excretes the salt byproduct as a brine through its bill. Often, the fluid drips out, and this gives the appearance of a runny nose. However, the fluid may also be sneezed out. In the absence of saltwater, caused by captivity, the supraorbital gland will lie dormant as it has no other purpose. Having a dormant supraorbital gland does not negatively affect the health of a penguin.

What has been described as \\"a very interesting sketch\\" of his career was given by James Edmonds Saunders in his late 19th-century work Early Settlers of Alabama. Biography John's life was saved by David Porter, USN, of the ship, Essex. John and other sailors (five killed by cannibals and two survived) had been marooned on the island of Nuku Hiva (also spelled \\"Nukahiva\\" or \\"Nookahevah\\") for two years surviving cannibalism between the wars of the Typees against the Happhas. They had been left on the island to gather sandalwood to sell in China when the war with England broke out and blockaded their ship that was to come back for them. A grandson of James Maury, John was the older brother of oceanographer and naval officer Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, and entered the United States navy as a midshipman when thirteen years old. It is reported that \\"He then had thrilling adventures in the South Seas, was with David Porter in the Essex during the bloody battle with the English at Valparaiso, and afterwards fought with Macdonough in the Battle of Lake Champlain\\". John Minor Maury's letters of his adventures in the navy that were sent home are considered to be a major reason why Matthew Maury decided on a naval career. John Minor Maury was also the father of USA and later CSA Major General Dabney Herndon Maury, who founded (1868-9) the Southern Historical Society, worked on it for 20 years, and was appointed to serve as U.S. Minister to Colombia, South America by President Grover Cleveland. Born very near Fredericksburg, Virginia, to Richard Maury (son of Rev. James Maury) and Diana (Minor) Maury (daughter of General John Minor). John Minor Maury was appointed midshipman on 16 January 1809 and commissioned Lieutenant 28 June 1811. He married Eliza Herndon Maury, daughter of Elizabeth Brooke and Fontaine Maury. Sons: William Maury (d.y.) and Dabney Herndon Maury. John Minor Maury was named after his ancestor, General John Minor. It is a name that continues through several generations. Matthew Fontaine Maury also had a nephew named (Lieutenant) John Minor Maury who was on the 1854 U S Navy Darien Expedition. John served on the Essex and Essex Junior (captured, ex-HMS Atlantic.) He served on the \\"Essex Jr.\\" in the Pacific, which brought home the survivors including Captain David Porter of the Essex which was destroyed in battle. John Minor Maury was promoted to first lieutenant, 1811; made flag captain to Commodore David Porter's fleet engaged in suppressing West Indian pirates, 1824. During the War of 1812, he participated in the Battle of Lake Champlain under Commander Thomas Macdonough in the complete victory over the British flotilla, which was captured or sunk. John Minor Maury wrote to a friend in Fredericksburg, \\"We have gained a glorious victory. I hope the most important result of it will be to confirm the wavering allegiance of New York and Vermont to the Union. They have been threatening to secede unless peace be made with England on any terms!\\" Soon after the close of the American war with England, the pirates of the West Indies had become a terror to all who sailed those seas. Captain David Porter (naval officer), then the most energetic and successful of our sailors, was ordered to fit out a squadron for their destruction. He was authorized to select his officers for a service so dangerous. His first choice was Lieut. John Minor Maury to be flag captain of the fleet. This officer, like the adjutant general of the army, gave orders for all the movements. The service was active and severe; the combats were desperate; no quarter was asked or given. The pirates were all destroyed or broken up and scattered. As a mark of special approbation of his services, Lieutenant John Minor Maury was sent by Commander David Porter to bear to the United States Government his report of the complete success of his operations. John sailed in the store ship Decoy, but died of yellow fever in June 1824, just outside the Capes of Norfolk, and was buried at sea, at the age of twenty eight. John Minor Maury had been first lieutenant of a frigate; and at twenty-six he was the flag captain of the fleet, and was considered by Tatnall, Buchanan and other compeers to have been the youngest and smartest young sailor in the American navy.

It was formerly known as Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary until its name was changed in 2012. The seminary offers a three-year Master of Divinity degree and two-year Master of Arts degrees in areas such as Pastoral Ministry; Chaplaincy; Christian Faith Formation; Theological Studies; Biblical Studies; History, Theology and Ethics; Peace Studies; Environmental Sustainability Leadership; and Global Anabaptism. The three-year Master of Divinity can be earned either on campus (M.Div. Campus) or in a hybrid format (M.Div. Connect), which consists of a combination of online and online/campus hybrid courses. Fully online options include the MA: Theology and Global Anabaptism and the Graduate Certificate in Theological Studies. AMBS is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. History Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary has roots in two former Mennonite seminaries: Goshen Biblical Seminary of the Mennonite Church and Mennonite Biblical Seminary of the General Conference Mennonite Church. Goshen Biblical Seminary Goshen Biblical Seminary at Goshen College, a Mennonite Church school in Goshen, Indiana, was one of two institutions that joined to form AMBS. Goshen Biblical Seminary was the direct continuation of the Bible School that began at Elkhart Institute in Elkhart, Indiana in 1894, while Elkhart Institute was organized as an academy. In 1903, Elkhart Institute moved to Goshen, Indiana, became Goshen College, and was reorganized as a junior college; in 1910 Goshen College was reorganized as a senior college. From 1894 until 1933, the Bible School offered a two-year course of study leading to a diploma and served as the Bible department of the college. In 1933, the Bible School began offering a four-year Th.B. (Bachelor of Theology), which expanded to a five-year course in 1942. In 1944, the Bible School was organized as a separate school with its own dean. In 1946, the school began using the name Goshen Biblical Seminary and began offering a seven-year B.D. (Bachelor of Divinity) with four years of liberal arts and three years of Bible and theology. In 1949, a B.R.E. (Bachelor of Religious Education) was added as a four-year program. In 1955, the Th.B. program was discontinued and the seminary was organized into graduate and undergraduate divisions. Harold S. Bender served as dean of the college and Bible School from 1931. Bender became dean of the seminary in 1944 when it was organized as a separate school and served until his death in 1962. In 1953-54, 67 students were enrolled. The total number of graduates from 1934-1956 was 190, with over 380 having matriculated. Goshen Biblical Seminary began aligning its academic program with that of Mennonite Biblical Seminary in 1958 and moved from Goshen to Mennonite Biblical Seminary's Elkhart campus after 1969. Mennonite Biblical Seminary Mennonite Biblical Seminary (MBS), a General Conference Mennonite Church institution in Chicago, Illinois, was the second school that became part of AMBS. The General Conference Mennonites had a history of educating pastors and church leaders which started with Wadsworth Institute (1868‚Äì1878), then Halstead Seminary (1883) the forerunner of Bethel College and Witmarsum Theological Seminary (1914‚Äì1931), part of Bluffton College. The Witmarsum school closed in 1931 for what was assumed to be a year or two during which a better location could be found and an association with an older seminary arranged. This would last until 1945 when a Chicago, Illinois, site was selected and an affiliation with Bethany Biblical Seminary was established. Mennonite Biblical Seminary was opened in September 1945 and used available space at Bethany for classes and student housing. By the fall of 1946 the seminary purchased property on the 4600 block of Woodlawn Avenue as it prepared for more students who were expected with the end of Civilian Public Service. Over the next six years most of the property on that block would become part of the Seminary. The school operated with five full-time faculty and two part-time administrative staff members. After the startup years, student enrollment averaged about 40 with about nine degrees granted each year.Pannabecker (1975), Ventures of Faith, p. 45. Each year about a dozen Mennonite students who were attending other Chicago schools were allowed to use Seminary apartments. In 1953, MBS worked together with Goshen Biblical Seminary to create a joint summer school for the following year. As this friendly exchange progressed throughout the next several years a desire for a larger inter-Mennonite seminary developed. This process was culminated in 1958 by which time the Chicago property had been sold and the Seminary moved to a new joint campus in Indiana. Association After the success of the 1954 cooperative summer school, the Goshen and Chicago seminaries started seriously exploring closer cooperation. Other Mennonite denominations were invited to explore what was hoped to be a larger inter-Mennonite school. Although the Evangelical Mennonite Church, Mennonite Brethren, Evangelical Mennonite Brethren and Brethren in Christ all showed initial interest, each of these bodies ultimately opted not to pursue this type of partnership.Pannabecker (1975), Ventures of Faith, p. 62. A plan was devised where each school would operate independently at a single site, sharing a library, a few joint courses, joint chapel services once a week and joint use of certain facilities. It was felt that the two denominations' respective constituencies would support this new venture only if the schools remained independent. This arrangement of two parallel schools is evident in the school's original plural name: Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminaries. The largest sticking point in the negotiations was selecting a suitable location. Although Bethel College in Kansas offered a site, this option was never seriously considered. The Goshen group wanted the seminary to be located on their existing campus at Goshen College in Indiana, believing their church members would not support a move. The General Conference Mennonites rejected this site for fear of being swallowed up by the larger group. Eventually an Elkhart, Indiana, site was chosen as a neutral location between the two schools. Ground breaking at the Elkhart property took place on September 3, 1957Pannabecker (1975), Ventures of Faith, p. 78: Pannabecker lists the year as 1958 here, which I believe is an error. and was essentially completed by the next August. A chapel was added and dedicated in June 1965.The architect, Charles Edward Stade, also designed the Chapel of the Resurrection at Valparaiso University. The Goshen Seminary received Association of Theological Schools accreditation in 1958 and Mennonite Biblical Seminary followed with accreditation in 1964. Over the years closer cooperation eventually eliminated the distinction between the two schools, and by 1994 they formally merged into the (now-singular) Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary. By 2002 the two Mennonite denominations themselves had joined to form a common structure, in which decades of cooperation between the two groups at AMBS had played a role. Institute of Mennonite Studies The Institute of Mennonite Studies (IMS) is the research and publishing arm of Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary.Institute of Mennonite Studies official site.

Meat from the farm is sold by direct marketing to consumers and restaurants.\\"High Priest of the Pasture,\\" New York Times, May 1, 2005. Early life and education Influenced by their Biblical understanding of earth stewardship and J. I. Rodale, Salatin's parents, William and Lucille, purchased a farm in the Shenandoah Valley in 1961 and began restoring its land. In high school, Salatin began his own business selling rabbits, eggs, butter and chicken from the farm at the Staunton Curb Market. He then attended Bob Jones University where he majored in English and was a student leader, graduating in 1979.Vintage [BJU yearbook] (1979), 366. Salatin was a member of the Inter-Collegiate Debate team, the winner of the Daniel J. Carrison Americanism essay contest, and was named to Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges. Salatin married his childhood sweetheart, Teresa, in 1980 and became a feature writer at the Staunton, Virginia newspaper, The News Leader, where he had worked earlier typing obituaries and police reports.  Career  Salatin with a flock of hens near their portable coop, surrounded by predator-deterrent electric netting  Farming  Polyface farm is a farm in Swoope, Virginia. The farmhouse was built in 1750 and added on throughout the years and was purchased by the Salatins in 1961 after losing a farm in Venezuela to political turmoil. Tiring of writing for the newspaper, Salatin decided to try farming full-time. Each year, Salatin revised his organic farming techniques, which are simple with low overhead and equipment costs, and the farm began to to turn a profit. Today the farm grosses $350,000 and is deemed a commercial farm by the United States Department of Agriculture. Salatin's philosophy of farming emphasizes healthy grass on which animals can thrive in a symbiotic cycle of feeding. Cows are moved from one pasture to another rather than being centrally corn fed. Then chickens in portable coops are moved in behind them, where they dig through the cow dung to eat protein-rich fly larvae while further fertilizing the field with their droppings. Salatin condemns the negative impact of the United States government on his livelihood because of what he considers an increasingly regulatory approach taken toward farming.Polyface Farms website, Joel's speaking topics He is a self-described \\"Christian libertarian environmentalist capitalist lunatic farmer\\" produces meat he describes as \\"beyond organic\\", which are raised using what the farm describes as environmentally responsible, ecologically beneficial, sustainable agriculture. Jo Robinson, an author, said of Salatin, \\"He's not going back to the old model. There's nothing in county extension or old-fashioned ag science that really informs him. He is just looking totally afresh at how to maximize production in an integrated system on a holistic farm. He's just totally innovative.\\" Commenting on a New York Times op-ed contribution about sustainable farming and bovine methane production, Salatin wrote \\"wetlands emit some 95 percent of all methane in the world; herbivores are insignificant enough to not even merit consideration. Anyone who really wants to stop methane needs to start draining wetlands.\\" Wetland methane emissions make up 20 to 39% of global methane emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He also said that most livestock producers use \\"Neanderthal management\\" that exaggerates the amount of land required, and that modern technology allows for far more sustainable land usage.  Writing  Salatin has been editor of the monthly agriculture magazine Stockman Grass Farmer promoting pasture-grazed lifestock, and teaches a two day course on agribusiness marketing in conjunction with this magazine.https://www.stockmangrassfarmer.com/Store/shop/index.php?productID=867 He has authored twelve books including Folks, This Ain't Normal; You Can Farm; and Salad Bar Beef.  Speaking  He has spoken as a farming educator at a wide-range of organizations including the University of California at Berkeley, and the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture.  Controversies  In March 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Salatin declared he wanted coronavirus on his personal website Musings from the Lunatic Farmer. Known for being outspoken, Salatin was widely condemned for his comments by the public and peers. In August 2020, Salatin responded to an article written by Chris Newman, a Black indigenous farmer, describing his lived experience farming while black. In Salatin's response, he told Newman to pull himself up by his bootstraps and included racist commentary which readers and fellow farmers, including Leah Penniman, felt was tone-deaf and a privileged view of Newman's experiences. Due to the controversy, Mother Earth News severed its relationship with Salatin.  Media  Salatin's farm, Polyface, is featured prominently in Michael Pollan's book The Omnivore's Dilemma (2006) and the documentary films, Food, Inc. and Fresh. Pollan became interested in Salatin because of his refusal to send food to locations not within a four-hour drive of his farm, i.e. outside his local \\"foodshed.\\" \\"We want [prospective customers] to find farms in their areas and keep the money in their own community,\\" said Salatin. \\"We think there is strength in decentralization and spreading out rather than in being concentrated and centralized.\\"Business Week, August 10, 2007 Salatin and his farm have also been featured in radio, television and print media including Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic, Gourmet, and ABC News.

In 1894, he married Mary Farmer, the daughter of John Farmer, who wrote the Preface for a collection of essays published after his death, Essays and Addresses. Burnet is best known for his work on Plato. His interest in philosophy and in Plato in particular seems to have begun during his service as assistant to Lewis Campbell at St. Andrews.Myles Burnyeat, \\"On the source of Burnet's construal of Apology 30b2‚Äì4: a correction\\", The Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. 125 (2005), pp. 139-142. Burnet was known for defending novel interpretations of Plato and Socrates, particularly the view that the depiction of Socrates in all of Plato's dialogues is historically accurate, and that the philosophical views peculiar to Plato himself are to be found only in the so-called late dialogues. Burnet also maintained that Socrates was closely connected to the early Greek philosophical tradition, now generally known as Pre-Socratic philosophy; Burnet believed that Socrates had been in his youth the disciple of Archelaus, a member of the Anaxagorean tradition (Burnet 1924, vi). Burnet's philological work on Plato is still widely read, and his editions have been considered authoritative for 100 years, as the 5-volume Oxford Classical Texts critical edition of Plato works and spuria (1900‚Äì1907). His commentaries on Plato's Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito and on the Phaedo also remain widely used and respected by scholars. Myles Burnyeat, for example, calls Burnet's Plato: Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, Crito \\"the still unsurpassed edition\\".p. 2 n. 5: Burnyeat. M. \\"The Impiety of Socrates\\", Ancient Philosophy 17 (1997): 1‚Äì12. S.R. Slings, editor of the new 2003 Oxford Classical Texts edition of Plato's Republic, described Burnet as \\"a superb editor, with a feeling for Platonic Greek that is unlikely to be ever surpassed.\\"p. 93, S.R. Slings (1998), \\"Platonis Opera. Tomus I tetralogias I-II continens\\", Mnemosyne 51 (1):93-102. Early Greek Philosophy Early Greek Philosophy is a book by John Burnet. Four editions were published by A. & C. Black, Ltd. in Great Britain. The first edition was published in April 1892, the second in June 1908, the third in September 1920 and the fourth, posthumously, in 1930. From the Preface to the Third Edition (unchanged in the fourth edition): > ...the main thesis of my book, and the vital point of the argument is my > insistence on the derivation of Atomism (which is admittedly materialistic) > from Eleaticism, in accordance with the express statements of Aristotle and > Theophrastos... There are many differences between the first and fourth editions. For example, the quote below comes from section 33: Philosophy as a life. in the first (1892) edition. In the third (1920) and fourth (1930) editions, the section has been moved to section 35, renamed to Philosophy as a way of life. and no longer mentions the Neoplatonists . John Burnet noted in his 1892 publication Early Greek Philosophy :The Neoplatonists were quite justified in regarding themselves as the spiritual heirs of Pythagoras; and, in their hands, philosophy ceased to exist as such, and became theology. And this tendency was at work all along; hardly a single Greek philosopher was wholly uninfluenced by it. Perhaps Aristotle might seem to be an exception; but it is probable that, if we still possessed a few such \\"exoteric\\" works as the Protreptikos in their entirety, we should find that the enthusiastic words in which he speaks of the \\"blessed life\\" in the Metaphysics and in the Ethics (Nicomachean Ethics) were less isolated outbursts of feeling than they appear now. In later days, Apollonios of Tyana showed in practice what this sort of thing must ultimately lead to. The theurgy and thaumaturgy of the late Greek schools were only the fruit of the seed sown by the generation which immediately preceded the Persian War. Legacy The University of St Andrews hall was named in his honour John Burnet Hall. Bibliography=Major works *Early Greek Philosophy. London and Edinburgh: A. and C.

He was considered one of the foremost confessional Lutheran theologians of the 20th century. Born in Sonnewalde, Germany, Sasse began his career under the influence of the theological liberalism of his teachers, such as Adolf Harnack. He was ordained on 13 June 1920 in St Matthew's Church in Berlin and thereafter served several parishes in Brandenburg, He spent a year (1925-1926) as an exchange student at Hartford Theological Seminary in the United States, where he earned a master's degree. Sasse returned to Germany to take up a teaching position at University of Erlangen. During this period, he became an active participant in the ecumenical movement. In the early 1930s, he emerged as a vocal critic of the National Socialist Party and Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler. While he did not sign the 1934 Barmen Declaration, he did author, with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and others, the first draft of the lesser known Bethel Confession of 1933. In 1949, Sasse emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia, where he served on the faculty of Luther Seminary of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia (later merged into the Lutheran Church of Australia), retiring in 1969.

There are plans to restore intercity bus service; however, this market is already well served by numerous private bus companies which depart from the Cola area and Charles Helou Station in Beirut to various destinations throughout Lebanon and Syria. The OCFTC's main competitor is the privately owned and operated Lebanese Commuting Company (LCC) which operates a fleet of red and white colored buses, mostly minibuses. Its service and efficiency is regarded to be better than the OCFTC and thus it charges slightly higher fares. Due to many problems that have been plaguing the OCFTC, there have been calls to transform it into a regulatory agency with the bus system becoming completely privatized, perhaps transferred entirely to the Lebanese Commuting Company (LCC). These plans may never materialize however. The OCFTC also owns all of the railway infrastructure in the country, however, as the railway system was severely damaged during Lebanese Civil War, none of the railway system is currently in operation. There are plans to revive Lebanon's railway system. The French railways, SNCF, have been hired to analyze the railway infrastructure in the country to see what steps should be taken to revive the system.

She and Irene Lewisohn founded the Museum of Costume Art. Bernstein was the lover, patron, and muse of novelist Thomas Wolfe. Early life She was born in 1880 in New York City, the daughter of Rebecca (Goldsmith) and Joseph Frankau, an actor. Joseph was a cousin of London cigar importer Arthur Frankau and thus, by marriage, of novelist and art historian Frank Danby, whom Aline recalled visiting as a child when Joseph Frankau was performing in London.Bernstein, Aline (1941) An Actor's Daughter, A. A. Knopf ‚Äì Ch. 7 passim Her family was Jewish.http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernstein-aline By the time she was 17, both of her parents had died and she was raised by her aunt, Rachel Goldsmith. Goldsmith had a theatrical boarding house on West 44th Street in New York City. Career One of Bernstein's set designs for the original Broadway production of Grand Hotel (1930) The Children's Hour (1934) Between 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions. Bernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name. In 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer. Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career. In the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by Knopf, a highly respected publisher at that time. She was personal friends with Arthur and Blanche Knopf. Her first book, Three Blue Suits, helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears ‚Äì or drags (the jacket on the floor) ‚Äì his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively. Some of her publications include: * Three Blue Suits (collection of short stories), 1933 * The Journey Down (over her relationship with Wolfe), Knopf, 1938 * Miss Condon, Knopf, 1947 * An Actor's Daughter (memoir), 1940 * The Martha Washington Doll Book, 1945 * Masterpieces of Women's Costume of the 18th and 19th Centuries, 1959 (published posthumously) In 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the opera Regina. The music and libretto were written Marc Blitzstein but based on the play The Little Foxes by Lillian Hellman, a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes. Although that production of Regina (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a Tony for her costume design in 1950. Personal life Aline married Theodore F. Bernstein, a Wall Street broker, on November 19, 1902.Biography of Bernstein in Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary, Volume 4, edited by Barbara Sicherman, Carol Hurd Green on Google books Bernstein and her husband had two children: Theodore Frankau Bernstein (1904‚Äì1949), and Edla Cusick (1906‚Äì1983). Her marriage remained intact throughout and despite her affair with Thomas Wolfe. Bernstein died on September 7, 1955, in New York City, aged 74. Relationship with Thomas Wolfe Bernstein met Thomas Wolfe in 1925 aboard the RMS Olympic when Wolfe was 25 and Bernstein 44. Bernstein became Wolfe's lover and provided Wolfe with emotional, domestic, and financial support while he wrote his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, which he dedicated to Bernstein. Wolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels Of Time and the River, The Web and the Rock, You Can't Go Home Again, and The Good Child's River. Bernstein, in turn, centered her autobiographical novel The Journey Down around her affair with Wolfe. Bernstein's and Wolfe's affair ended after a few years, but their friendship continued. One of Wolfe's last phone calls, when he was dying of a brain tumor at age 37, was to tell Bernstein he loved her. At the time of Wolfe's death in 1938, Bernstein possessed some of Wolfe's unpublished manuscripts. In the 2016 biographical drama film Genius, Bernstein was portrayed by Nicole Kidman, while Wolfe was portrayed by Jude Law. The 2019 monologue, \\"Vogue,\\" written for the 365 Days of Women by playwright Libby Mitchell is inspired by the life of Aline Bernstein.

The show ran for one season on NBC, and four seasons on CBS. It was a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman production, and was initially sponsored by Old Gold cigarettes. Humorist Herb Shriner was the host for most of the show's run, with fellow humorist Sam Levenson hosting the last season. The game show was initially directed by Paul Alter. With the success of Groucho Marx and his show, You Bet Your Life, which aired on NBC, Mark Goodson was looking for a similar format that was as much a showcase for the host as it was a game. Two for the Money was just that, with as much of Shriner's homespun Hoosier humor as there was actual game play. But there was a game to be played, and its format was fairly simple. In the first round, a pair of contestants would be given a category, and would come up with as many correct answers that fit the category as possible within a fifteen-second time period. An example of a category: \\"States whose names end in 'A'.\\" Each correct answer was worth $5.00. The other important rule is that the contestants had to alternate in giving their responses. Round two was much the same, but each correct answer's value was determined by the amount won in the first round ‚Äî if the contestants won $25 in the first round, each correct second-round answer was worth $25. The amount won in the second round would be the value of each correct answer in the third and final round. Shriner had help in judging correct answers from Mason Welch Gross, a professor from Rutgers University. Dr. Gross would sound a buzzer should he catch the team repeating an answer or giving an incorrect answer. For a brief time while Dr. Gross was away, Walter Cronkite filled in. Dr. Gross eventually became the university's president, and namesake of its fine arts program. Actor Walter O'Keefe and humorist and TV personality Sam Levenson served as Shriner's substitutes. Kenny Williams (who from 1960, until before is death in 1985, would be the \\"voice\\" of nearly all the game shows produced by Merrill Heatter & Bob Quigley) was the announcer. In 1957, Ed McMahon made his network TV debut as the show's announcer. Milton DeLugg conducted the show's orchestra. Dennis James was primary sponsor Old Gold cigarettes' spokesman; Bob Shepperd was the pitchman for other sponsors. The show was also remade in the United Kingdom for the then-new ITV network in 1956, lasting only one series. The UK version was hosted by Bernard Braden. Seventeen-year-old Tom Brokaw, governor of South Dakota Boys' State, appeared with the real governor of South Dakota, Joe Foss, in 1957. Together they won $1,225, answering questions mainly about politics (one of the categories was \\"state governors,\\" and one of Brokaw's answers, as he recounts in his autobiography, was \\"The honorable Joe Foss of South Dakota\\"). The series finished #14 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1954-1955 season.http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1954.htm It received Emmy nominations for Best Audience Participation, Quiz or Panel Program in 1953 and 1954.http://www.emmys.com/shows/two-money Episode status 17 episodes survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. One episode is included in the set \\"Classic Game Shows & More\\", released by Mill Creek Entertainment. 171 out of the approximately 209 episodes from the Herb Shriner run survive at the Library of Congress. Combined with 11 exclusive to UCLA, the number comes out to 182. The status of the Sam Levenson shows is unclear.

When the pair got fired from their jobs, they teamed up to create a business as equal partners. The tagline of the series was \\"First she got fired, then she got fired up.\\" Plot Gwendolyn Leonard epitomized the term \\"self-involved.\\" After being fired from her corporate job, she was reduced to moving in with her former assistant, spunky Terry Reynolds, and starting up a new promotions business as her partner. Terry and her brother Danny shared a loft apartment atop a clock tower in New York City, and Danny worked as bartender at Clockworks, the restaurant below, while he pursued his dream of becoming a writer. Clockworks was owned by Guy Mann, an average Joe who adamantly pursued Gwen, though she kept him at arm's length (his response to each of her blow-offs was \\"Oh, yeah!\\"). Also regularly seen was Mrs. Francis, a crotchety unemployment agent whom Gwen ultimately inspired to quit her job and open an eggroll shop; Ashley Mann, Guy's son who worked as a female impersonator; Scott Bickley, Danny's lecherous agent who moonlighted as a suit salesman; and Steve Summer, a former classmate of Gwen's who'd carried a torch for her for decades.

It was adapted from the 1982 off- Broadway play of the same name by William Mastrosimone. Both Fawcett and Russo had appeared in the stage play (Fawcett taking over a role originated by Susan Sarandon), and Fawcett received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Plot Marjorie is a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates, Pat and Terry in Los Angeles. One night, while getting into her car, she is attacked at knifepoint by a masked assailant, who forces her to touch him sexually. Marjorie manages to escape, but not before the mugger makes off with her purse. She goes to the police but is told there is very little they can do. One week later, while Marjorie's roommates are at work, her nightmare comes true as the assailant (named Joe) casually enters her house, having used her personal information to find out where she lives. A terrifying sequence of events unfolds as Joe subjects Marjorie to a continuous barrage of mental and physical assaults. The tables finally turn, however, when Marjorie overpowers Joe by spraying his eyes and mouth with insect repellent as he's getting ready to rape her. Marjorie then ties Joe up and subjects him to the same kind of physical and mental assaults he used on her earlier, even reducing him to tears as he pleads for his life when he learns that he's ingested some of the insect repellent Marjorie sprayed at him. When Terry and Pat return home, they try to convince Marjorie, who is contemplating murdering Joe, to think about the consequences of her actions, because Joe didn't actually rape or attempt to kill her. Joe attempts to fabricate a story that he had a one-night stand with Marjorie at a party some time ago, which her roommates almost believe. Marjorie calls him a liar and attacks him, finding the sheath knife he used on her in the first attack, proving her story to Patty and Terry. Marjorie forces Joe to admit his guilt by torturing him with the blade, and at one point threatens to castrate him if he does not tell the truth. Defeated, a sobbing Joe confesses that he watched the house and stole letters to find out details of the women's lives, and that he intended to rape and kill Marjorie and her roommates that day. He also confesses to the rapes and presumed murders of three other women. Finally at peace, Marjorie allows Patty and Terry to get the police. CastAward Nomination For her performance, Fawcett received a 1986 Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a film drama.

Born and reared in River Rouge, Michigan, Delo started performing first as a magician, then a ventriloquist, and later a hypnotist before taking up singing by miming to records. While attending the Roman Catholic-affiliated Our Lady Of Lourdes High School in River Rouge, he made his public singing debut as a member of a doo-wop group known as The Pencil Smudges, a take-off of the group The Ink Spots, singing \\"The Battle of Jericho\\" at a school recital. About 1961 after serving in the United States Army, Delo teamed up with his Army buddy and fellow performer Jonathan Daly to form the Martin & Lewis-style comedy team of Delo & Daly. The act was very popular in Australia throughout the 1960s with their television variety show and numerous concert appearances, however upon their arrival back to the United States to capitalize on their growing fame, the act broke up as Daly chose to go into television production work. By 1969, Delo was now in Los Angeles moving on with his career; making guest TV appearances on shows such as Mission: Impossible and Here's Lucy. His introduction to Lawrence Welk came from Arthur Duncan, the show's featured tap dancer who had known Delo from their days in Australia. Upon Duncan's recommendation, the maestro invited him on the show as a guest star, singing the Hawaiian Wedding Song. Three more guest appearances and positive viewer response led Lawrence to hire him as a full-time performer for the 1969-70 season, and remained on for the remainder of the show's run. Delo's performances frequently involved his sitting in the audience, singing directly to various female show-goers. After the show ended, Delo continued his performing career, either on the road with his fellow Welk stars or as a headliner at the Lawrence Welk Resort in Branson, Missouri, from 1994 to 1999. He also became an author, penning the novel The Frozen Horror. He lived in Gilbert, Arizona, with his wife Marilyn. They were married 30 June, 1956. His record label KimKev Records is named after his two children, Kimberly and Kevin. Delo died from pneumonia in February 2016 at the age of 77.

It is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is 15 km from Erode, 30 km from Gobichettipalayam, 56 km from Salem and 106 km from Coimbatore. The temple was built at the confluence of rivers Kaveri, Bhavani and the mystic Amutha (Agaya Gangai). The temple was praised in old Tamil literature as Thirunana. The place is also known as Dakshina Triveni Sangamam and Kooduthurai indicating the confluence of three rivers. Devotees perform last rites for ancestors on the riverbank and offer prayers at the Sangameshwarar temple. History and myths Image of the shrines Kubera, son of Vishrava was gifted an aircraft to visit Shiva temples across the country in recognition of his devotion to Lord Shiva. While he was flying near the river Cauvery Kubera was surprised to see a deer, tiger, cow, elephant, snake and rat drinking water near an Ilandhai tree on the river bank without enmity, to answer his wonder Kubera heard a voice from the sky saying it was a place where vedas visited, inhabited by gandharvas and advised him to worship the shivalingam under the iilanadhi tree. The temples Ilandhai tree gives fruit on all season which was used for everyday puja even today. During the period of Chera Chola and Pandya's there was a cave connection existed between Chidambaram and Sangameshwarar temple and puja's are performed at same time in both temples. The cow behind the Vishnu statue remains the harmony between Saivism and Vaishnavism. It was said from generations that every inch under the temple has one shivalingam. In the year 1804, William Karo, a British Collector of Coimbatore district, visited Bhavani, camping in the Travellers' Bungalow. One night, when he was asleep, a small girl woke him up and got him out of the Bungalow. Once they were out, the Bungalow collapsed. Shocked by this incident, the Collector turned to thank the girl but to find, she wasn't there. The next day, the priest on duty informed him that it was Bhavani Vedanaayaki Amman, who saved his life. He bore three holes in the temple wall exactly opposite to Vedanaayaki Amman shrine and torched these holes to pray the goddess. He offered a gold plate to the goddess with his signature dated 11/01/1804. The holes and the gold plate are present even now and are taken care with caution. Architecture Ghat where sacrifices are performed The temple is constructed on a plot. The main RajaGopuram with 5 tiers is located on the north side of the temple. The presiding deity is Lord Shiva known as Sangameswarar along with his consort Pannaar Mozhiyaal or Vedanayagi. A shrine dedicated to Kartikeya is situated between the shrines of Siva and Parvati. There is also separate shrine inside the temple for Lord Vishnu and his consort Soundaravalli Thaayar. The stala vriksham is an ilandai (Zizyphus mauritiana) tree. The annual Brahmotsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chitrai. Rock status of this temple represents the beauty of stone carving and the culture of the people. When water or milk poured on the two identical stone statues in front of ambal sannidhi- Hindu goddess, one smiles at you, while the other sheds tears at you. The temple got a precious Ambal statue, a Hindu goddess donated by a district collector during British period for saving his life. Of all the seven holy Shiva centers of the Kongu Region, Bhavani is known as Thirunana in script. The holy waters of Sangameswarar temple is known as Cauvery theertham, Surya theertham and Gayatri theertham. The Amirthalingeswarar in the temple is placed on a seat called Avudayar according to Saiva principles. It is a mobile one that can be removed and placed on the seat again. Men and women seeking boons for children take the Sivalinga, perform puja and walk around it for three times and place it back on the Avudayar. The Amirthalinga is in the southern entrance of the temple.  Literary mention  It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. The Nayanmars Thevaram pathigam is composed by Sambandar. He had composed 10 poems in this temple in the praise of the lord which comes under 2nd Thirumurai.

Namesake Saint Maurice was Primicerius of the Theban Legion. In 287 AD it marched in service of the Roman Empire fighting against the revolt in the Berguadae Gauls. His men were composed entirely of Christians recruited from upper Egypt, near the Valley of the Kings. The Legion marched to the Mediterranean Sea, was transported across, and traveled across Italy to an area in Switzerland. Serving under Augustus Maximian Hercules, better known to history as Maximian, Maurice was ordered to have his legionnaires offer pagan sacrifices before battle near the Rhone at Martigny. The Theban Legion refused to participate, and also refused to kill innocent civilians in the conduct of their duty, and withdrew to the town of Agaunum. Enraged, Maximian ordered every tenth man killed, yet they still refused. A second time the General ordered Maurice‚Äôs men to participate and again they refused. Maurice declared his earnest desire to obey every order lawful in the eyes of God. ‚ÄúWe have seen our comrades killed,‚Äù came the reply. ‚ÄúRather than sorrow, we rejoice at the honor done to them.‚Äù At this Maximian ordered the butchery of the Thebans and the martyrdom of Saint Maurice.

It is run by Evil (Morgan Steinmeyer H√•kansson) of Marduk, but the band was formed in 1989 by IT (a.k.a. Tony S√§rkk√§). All (a.k.a. Jim Berger), Ext and Evil joined the band later. IT was one of the leaders of the True Satanist Horde, part of the Swedish Black metal scene. Euronymous, co-founder of Mayhem and founder of Deathlike Silence Productions, described Abruptum as \\"the audial essence of pure black evil\\". History IT had already planned to create the band in 1987, but it was not until 1990 that he found the right members to do it. The same year, they recorded their first two demos. After the release of the first demo, they fired their bass player, Ext. After the release of a 7-inch EP Evil in 1991 (later re-released by Psychoslaughter), All began to drink heavily and was forced to leave the band. IT then found a new member in \\"Evil\\". Around this time, IT reunited with All to form the side project, Vondur. Abruptum was signed to Euronymous's label Deathlike Silence Productions, on which they released two albums. Euronymous described them as \\"the audial essence of pure black evil\\", and IT considered Euronymous to be \\"a true ally\\". After Euronymous's murder, Abruptum contributed the opening track to the compilation album Nordic Metal: A Tribute to Euronymous. Controversy surrounded Abruptum's close relationship with Euronymous, with Varg Vikernes specifically referencing Abruptum when recalling his version of the events and motives leading to the death of Euronymous. Vikernes, claiming that he killed Euronymous in self-defense, recalled in a 2006 interview: It has been wrongly rumored IT left the band and the black metal scene altogether in 1996, following numerous threats made to him and to his family. According to IT himself and his sister/manager, that was not at all the reason for his departure from the scene, as he had simply been wanting to leave for some time until he ultimately did. Evil kept Abruptum going and released material on his own record label, Blooddawn Productions, until 2005 when he announced that he had ended Abruptum. Since Abruptum's disbanding, IT joined an industrial band called 8th Sin, and was briefly involved with the band (Total) War along with All. All worked with IT again in Ophthalamia, but that band has also disbanded. IT eventually died on 8 February 2017, aged 44. Evil continues his work with Marduk and Death Wolf (formerly known as Devil's Whorehouse), yet brought Abruptum back in 2008, recording and releasing an EP (\\"Malediction\\") that same year and a full length (\\"Potestates Apocalypsis\\") in 2011 under his Blooddawn Productions label.  Music themes and style  While Abruptum is classified as a black metal/dark ambient band, the band took a different approach to their music. They did not focus on creating any structured songs, and mostly just made noise. Earlier material had shorter songs but their later releases typically included one or two tracks with more than forty minutes of music. They primarily used standard drums, guitars, bass, keyboards and other various instruments, but what stood out even more was the screaming, as the band supposedly tortured and cut each other during their recordings. Whether this is true or not has never really been verified. This led to Euronymous' now (in)famous distinction of Abruptum as \\"The Audial Essence of Pure Black Evil\\". After IT left the band, Evil changed the band's musical style to more dark ambient/noise and dropped most of the metal sound.

Biography He was born in Great Falls, Montana to Swedish immigrant parents and earned his B.A. from Walla Walla University. In 1918, he began his long career of service in the Seventh-day Adventist missions of East Asia, where he gained particular distinction in the fields of general education and language training. The University of Washington awarded Nelson a Ph.D. in 1938 for his dissertation on The origin, history, and present status of the temples of Japan. After retiring from missionary work in 1961, he was preoccupied with placing the finishing touches on his masterpiece, The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary, which first appeared in print the following year. The work, which was posthumously revised and expanded by a team led by John H. Haig at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, was reissued in 1997 as The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary; however, many scholars, teachers, and students continue to use the original edition of Nelson's dictionary, which has remained in print, because of changes made in Haig's edition that are viewed as impairing the functionality of the work. It is one of the most authoritative Kanji dictionaries for English learners of the language, and displays particular sensitivity to the difficulties they may have with the Kangxi radical system traditionally used to classify Kanji. Nelson died in Hong Kong. Administrator=Philippine Union College While President of Philippine Union College, Nelson also served as a chaplain at the New Bilibid Prison.

It was released on February 22, 1999 through Osmose Productions. It is the first Immortal album not to feature Demonaz on guitar, as he suffered from acute tendinitis in his hands. The album marks a shift in Immortal's musical sound, towards a black metal and thrash metal fusion.  Background  At the Heart of Winter was recorded in November 1998 at Abyss Studios in Sweden. It is the first Immortal album not to feature a picture of the band on the cover, and the first to prominently feature the band's new logo, with the cover art was painted by J.P. Fournier. It is also the final release by the band until 2018's Northern Chaos Gods to be recorded in standard tuning. The subsequent releases would be recorded in D standard tuning.  Release  In addition to a CD release, At the Heart of Winter was released as a limited edition metal box, as well as a hand-numbered LP on Osmose, which was later reissued in 2005.  Reception  At the Heart of Winter was well received by critics. John Serba of Allmusic praised the album, writing, \\"the result is a clarity and focus that few purveyors of the genre succeeded at finding, a painstakingly organized assemblage of black metal's base elements into a disciplined purity of metal that prefers the power of the almighty riff, instead of the occasionally overblown classical structuring of much-lauded stalwarts Emperor and Cradle of Filth, or the strange experimentation that Mayhem and Arcturus would undertake\\".

He was a rock and roll pioneer and founding member of the rock and roll group Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. Early years Negroni's family moved from Puerto Rico to New York City in the 1930s during the Great Depression era. The family lived in Manhattan where Negroni met and befriended Herman Santiago. In the early 1950s, Negroni, Santiago, and two other friends Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes would get together in front of Santiago's stoops (building stairs) and sing songs to the beat of Doo- Wops.Rockabilly Negroni, who had a baritone voice, and his friends called themselves the \\"Ermines\\" with Santiago as lead singer. On one occasion, the Ermines performed alongside the \\"Cadillacs\\" at P.S. 143 (Public School 143). The Ermines changed their name to \\"Coupe de Villes\\" and later to \\"The Premiers\\".Doo-Wop The \\"Teenagers\\" In 1954, 12-year-old Frankie Lymon worked in a grocery store. One night, The Premiers and Lymon's brother performed in a talent show held at JHS Stitt (Junior High School Stitt). Frankie approached The Premiers, telling them how good they sounded. They started jamming together, and the Premiers were impressed with the sound of Frankie's high tenor/soprano voice. Lymon sang a few numbers with them, like \\"You Painted Pictures\\" and \\"Lily Maebelle,\\" and by early 1955, they had invited him to join, with Lymon singing first tenor behind Santiago's lead. In 1955, Richard Barrett, a scout for \\"Gee Records,\\" heard them singing and introduced them to George Goldner, the owner of Gee. Upon hearing them sing, Goldner signed them to a contract and changed the group's name to \\"The Teenagers.\\"Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers The following day, the group was supposed to meet with Goldner in the studio for a recording session. Santiago, who was the lead singer, was ill and could not accompany the other members; therefore, he gave Negroni the music sheet with the words to the song that he had written. The song was \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" (which was originally reworked from a poem called \\"Why Do Birds Sing So Gay\\"). Since Santiago was not present, Goldner asked Frankie if he could sing the song. Frankie accepted, and they recorded the song. Goldner then changed the group's name to \\"Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers\\" and released the record. The song became an instant hit in the United States, and in the United Kingdom, it also became the first top British hit of an American vocal group. In London, the group played at the Palladium. Upon hearing them sing, young girls acted wild, a matter that bothered the establishment more than somewhat. Alan Freed signed them for two movies. The Teenagers had three other hits that reached the top 10 in the R&B; charts: \\"I Want You to Be My Girl\\" (#3), \\"Who Can Explain?\\" (#7), and \\"The ABC's of Love\\" (#8). Later years and death In 1957, Frankie Lymon, upon the urging of Goldner, left \\"the Teenagers\\" and went solo. Eventually the group broke up. Santiago tried to reunite \\"the Teenagers\\" in the 1970s and 1980s, in ill-fated comeback attempts. On February 27, 1968, Lymon was found dead in his grandmother's bathroom from a heroin overdose. In 1977, Garnes had died from a heart attack, and on September 5, 1978, Joe Negroni died from a cerebral hemorrhage in a New York apartment or home, just four days before his 38th birthday. Negroni was survived by his three children, two daughters and a son.

Colpix got its name from combining Columbia (Col) and Pictures (Pix). CBS, which owned Columbia Records, then sued Columbia Pictures for trademark infringement over the Colpix name. It was founded by Jonie Taps and Harry Cohn in 1958 and was based in New York City. Paul Wexler headed the label. Stu Phillips was in charge of A&R.; Lester Sill later headed the label, after breaking with Philles Records partner Phil Spector. The label's roster included Lou Christie, James Darren, Paul Petersen, Freddie Scott, Tommy Boyce. Two of the label's best known number one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Charts were \\"Blue Moon\\" by the Marcels in the spring of 1961 (also a number one in the UK, where Colpix was licensed to Pye International), and \\"Johnny Angel\\" by Shelley Fabares in the spring of 1962. Bernadette Castro recorded for the label \\"Get Rid of Him\\"/\\"A Girl in Love Forgives\\" and \\"His Lips Get in the Way\\"/\\"Sportscar Sally\\". Singer Jo Ann Greer, who dubbed several of the actresses at Columbia Pictures, recorded two albums with the studio's musical director, Morris Stoloff: Soundtracks, Voices and Themes and The Naked City, a film noir musical with James Darren. Colpix released the first LPs from standup comedians Dick Gregory and Woody Allen, and a soundtrack album of Hanna-Barbera cartoons. It included dialogue by Yogi Bear and Pixie and Dixie with narration by Daws Butler in the voice of Huckleberry Hound. In the wake of President Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, numerous tribute albums were released the following year. In association with United Press International, Colpix released Four Days That Shocked the World with radio coverage of the President's arrival at Dallas Love Field, the moment of the shooting in Dealey Plaza, and the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald two days later. The album included a booklet with UPI reporter Merriman Smith's account of the assassination. The label was discontinued in 1966 and replaced by Colgems Records, which was primarily used for releases by The Monkees. Before their involvement with the Monkees, Davy Jones and Michael Nesmith (under the pseudonym Michael Blessing) had each signed to Colpix Records as solo artists. Colpix was the first big label for singer and pianist Nina Simone after having made her debut on Bethlehem Records. She recorded albums for the label from 1959 (The Amazing Nina Simone) through 1964 (Folksy Nina). In 1966 Colpix Nina Simone with Strings, an album of left-overs with strings added, when Simone was already signed to Philips Records. Rhino Records, which currently owns the Colpix catalogue, issued a double compact disc compilation, The Colpix-Dimension Story, in 1994, which also included selections from Dimension Records, a related label.

It is the first book of the War of the Spider Queen series, based on the Forgotten Realms setting of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Plot summary Pharaun and Ryld journey to a tavern, where Ryld plays sava (a chess-like game) while Pharaun goes to the basement, where various female drow captives are available for males to do with as they see fit with. Pharaun talks with one of them who reveals the name of several elopers. While he is there, Ryld is attacked by other males whom he has taught. Afterwards, the two companions talk about the quest and decide the males are eloping because of the unusually harsh rule of the females in the last few weeks. Pharaun reveals that he has reason to believe that Lolth is gone and as such the females cannot use divine spells anymore, and are limited to scrolls and magic items. Ryld, though skeptical at first, eventually believes him. They learn of an uprising among the lower class creatures led by a mysterious prophet, and decide to pretend that they support the elopers. They kill a group of Drow to prove their \\"dedication\\" to the cause and are reluctantly taken in. They learn that the mastermind behind the rebellion is an evil illithid lich (called an \\"alhoon\\" or an \\"illithilich\\"), and that when he sends a mental signal, all the lower creatures will attack. While this is all happening, Gromph Baenre is sending various demons to attack Quenthel Baenre, all taking the guise of various aspects of Lloth, e.g. a demon spider, a demon of chaos, a darkness demon, and others. While this happens, a group of students at Arach-Tinilith decide that Lloth is disfavouring Quenthel, and resolve to kill her. She learns of this plan and has the offending students killed. Another subplot involves an ambassador from the neighbouring city of Ched Nasad being refused the right to leave by Triel Baenre. She eventually attempts to leave and is stopped by a traitor in her household. She then escapes the city, but is caught and taken to Triel. She realizes someone has turned Triel against her and is tortured by Jeggred Baenre, Triel's draegloth son. Eventually the lower races get the signal to rebel. Pharaun escapes from the Illithid and gathers the forces of Menzoberranzan to fight. A battle ensues, where much of Menzoberranzan is marred. At the end, the general populace realizes the weakness of the priestesses, and Pharaun, Ryld, Quenthel, Jeggred, and the ambassador, Faeryl Zauvirr, are sent to Ched Nasad to see if they are also afflicted. Characters ; Pharaun Mizzrym: A mage from House Mizzrym. He is charismatic and is a fine example of a drow mage ‚Äì well dressed, eloquent, and never left standing on one foot. He employs a variety of tools to get the job done ‚àí magic and subterfuge are the two most often seen, but he will not hesitate to make a deal with a whore or murder seven apprentices to gain power. He is often contrasted with Ryld Argith, but the two share a steadfast friendship that is somewhat shaken at the end of the book. ;Ryld Argith: A master warrior at Melee-Magthere, the warrior school of the Drow. He is often blunt and appears slightly uncultured compared to his companion Pharaun. This is largely attributed to the fact that, unlike Pharaun, he was born a commoner and not an aristocrat. However he has managed to rise up and maintain a respectable position. He enjoys a good friendship with Pharaun Mizzrym that is built upon their differences. He joins Pharaun to look for missing males in the beginning of Dissolution. ;Gromph Baenre: The Archmage of the Drow city, thought to be one of the most powerful wizards alive. He is the first character we are introduced to in the book, and he is one of the last we leave. He has a deep feud with his sister Quenthel, and sends many demons to attack her throughout the course of the book. ;Quenthel Baenre: The High Priestess of Arach- Tinilith. She is vicious and is left highly strung by the disturbance among the females of the Drow. She disagrees with Gromph on most subjects, and when they advise their mother, or more recently, their sister, they disagree on all topics they are asked for their opinions on. ;Triel Baenre: The newly instated head of House Baenre. She didn't ask for the seat of her mother, but she got it anyway. She is relatively short for a Drow and is highly sensitive to this. When she is stuck for advice she asks her siblings, Gromph and Quenthel. Because they always offer different arguments, this allows her to see two perspectives of each scenario, giving her significant insight. Recently, however, she has been a bit out of contact with them. ;Faeryl Zauvirr: The ambassador of Ched Nasad from the House Zauvirr. Major themes One of the major themes of the book is the constant struggle between the houses of the Drow, and their inherent chaos and evil that is such a powerful contrast to our society today. The quote from the very first page sums it up: Evil, like chaos, is one of the fundamental forces of Creation, manifest in both the macrocosm of the wide world and the microcosm of the individual soul. As chaos gives rise to possibility and imagination, so evil engenders strength and will. It makes sentient beings aspire to wealth and power. It enables them to subjugate, kill, rob and deceive. It allows them to do whatever is required to better themselves with never a crippling flicker of remorse. The book contrasts the Drow society with ours today. A running theme is the way the Drow treat the lesser races ‚àí one Drow is seen as ripping pieces of flesh from the ribcage of a still-living goblin to feed his pet. But it is the uncaring, almost casual way that the Dark Elves do this that contrasts so harshly with our world. Another contrast is the matriarchal Drow society. The book's main plotline of the eloping males is caused by the viciousness of the stronger, higher ranking females. This is similar to hyena society.

Voelpel commented about this book: \\"A serviceable first novel in the War of the Spiderqueen series Dissolution does not enjoy the higher level of writing from its patron R.A. Salvatore (the best and best known Forgotten Realms writer). Byers does an admirable job trying to flesh a bunch of characters with no real redeeming qualities or like ability. That itself is the inherent problem with the novel since all the main characters are by definition evil and corrupt you have trouble rooting for anybody. Probably the two best characters are the mage Pharaun and his friend Ryld, as a real bond can be seen between them, their less savory qualities not withstanding.\\" References Category:2002 American novels Category:War of the Spider Queen novels ","title":"Dissolution (Forgotten Realms novel)"},{"id":"4147417","text":"Palazzo Madama () in Rome is the seat of the Senate of the Italian Republic.Sito del Senato della Repubblica History It was built atop the ruins of the ancient baths of Nero, next to Piazza Navona. The terrain had been acquired in the Middle Ages by the monks of the Abbey of Farfa, who later ceded it to France. The new building was begun at the end of the 15th century and completed in 1505, for the Medici family. It housed two Medici cardinals and cousins, Giovanni and Giulio, who both later became popes as Leo X and Clement VII, respectively. Catherine de' Medici, Clement VII's niece, also lived here before she was married to Henry, son of King Francis I of France in 1533. Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, patron of the artist Caravaggio, lived there until his death in 1627. The palace takes its name from Madama Margherita of Austria, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who married another illegitimate son, Alessandro de' Medici and, after his death, Ottavio Farnese. Thus part of the art collection of the Florentine Medici family was inherited by the Farnese family. Mid-17th century fa√ßade with cornice The current fa√ßade was built in the mid-1650s by both Cigoli and Paolo Maruccelli. The latter added the ornate cornice and whimsical decorative urns on the roof. After the extinction of the Medici in 1743, the palace was handed over to the House of Lorraine and, later, to Pope Benedict XIV, who made it the seat of the Papal Government. In 1849, Pius IX moved here the Ministries of Finances and of the Public Debt, as well as the Papal Post Offices. In 1871, after the conquest of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, the palazzo became the seat of the Senato del Regno.

The message is rooted in the text of Isaiah 54:2-3: : Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.

The 38th Street gang became well known in the 1940s in the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial. Sleepy Lagoon was a popular swimming hole in what is now East Los Angeles. A Mexican American juvenile named Jose Diaz was killed there in 1942, and members of the 38th Street Mexican American gang were arrested and charged with murder by the Los Angeles Police Department.Valdez, A. (2007). Gangs: A Guide to Understanding Street Gangs (5th ed. p. 98-99, ). San Clemente, CA: LawTech Publishing Co. All five of the gang members were convicted and sentenced to prison. These convictions ultimately united the Mexican community and changed Mexican gangs. The jail sentences also acted as a glue to unite the Mexican and Mexican American community in a common cause, a fight against class distinction based on prejudice and racism, a fight against the establishment. In prison, 38th Street gang members were held in high esteem. On October 4, 1943, the convictions of the gang members were overturned and the gang members were allegedly welcomed back to their communities as heroes. Two members of the 38th Street Gang, circa 1993. During \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", the media exaggerated the headlines about the gang that wore zoot suits and created wartime hysteria and prejudice against the Mexican-American community. In what was known as the Zoot Suit Riots in May to June 1943, many Mexican- American zoot suiters from the segregated parts of town were attacked by European American servicemen and residents of Los Angeles. The white servicemen and residents felt Zoot Suiters were not contributing to the war effort and were wasting valuable resources by dressing so flamboyantly. Los Angeles police officers did nothing to halt the angry mobs from rioting, arresting the zoot suiters instead of the attackers. After the riots and because of international criticism, the United States Department of War banned all military personnel from going to Los Angeles on leave. The Los Angeles City Council adopted a resolution that banned the wearing of zoot suits on Los Angeles streets, although no ordinance was approved by the City Council nor signed into law by the Mayor. 38th Street is often credited for starting a new style of dress: during the time the Sleepy Lagoon defendants were incarcerated, their prison-issue clothes were deliberately oversized, with the intention of drawing ridicule from Anglo inmates and prison staff. However, the Sleepy Lagoon defendants maintained their clothing well, cleaning and ironing it. Location The 38th Street gang occupies a huge area on the east side of South Los Angeles and some areas in East Los Angeles. These neighborhoods had been historically known to be some of the most dangerous in the nation. Their rivalries expand to most neighborhoods all over Los Angeles County. They also have confirmed cliques in, Salt Lake City, West valley, Utah,Unified Wisconsin, and Iowa. (2008). Gang names and alliances. Retrieved from website: http://updsl.org/divisions/metro_gang_unit/downloads/Gang Names and Alliances.pdf and Wisconsin. Criminal activities Since the 1920s, the 38th Street gang has continued its criminal activities and has evolved to become one of California's most violent street gangs. Members conduct various activities, including drug sales, murder, theft and vandalism. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city closed many of its roads in the 38th Street vicinity due to high volume of people coming to purchase narcotics in the area. City administrators hoped that the blocked streets would deter nonresidents from purchasing narcotics. By the late 1990s, a federal task force was set up in order to investigate the gang's involvement in illegal drug trade; this resulted in the arrest of several of its members. The authorities confiscated thousands of dollars in drugs and money, as reported by the Los Angeles Times and local news channels. The group has historically quarreled with various rival gangs for placement and competition, which has resulted in many drive-by shootings and deaths. On August 24, 2004, a law enforcement preliminary injunction terminated the active members of the 38th Street gang, out of the streets, banning them from using firearms, alcohol, graffiti and other dangerous materials in public. 38th Street, being an old and large gang, has accumulated countless rivalries in Los Angeles county and other cities where they have established. During the 1980s, 38th Street became heavily involved in drug sales and trafficking became a specialty crime that some gang members perfected. Today 38th Street relies almost exclusively on narcotics sales and distribution as its only source of revenue. In February 2011 the FBI arrested 37 suspects connected to the 38th Street. They were arrested on narcotics and firearms charges. The 38th Street gang is the subject of a 130-page grand jury indictment alleging violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute. Some 53 defendants are charged with violating the federal law by acting on behalf of the gang and participating in murders, murder plots, attempted murders, narcotics trafficking, robberies, extortion and witness intimidation.38th Street gang members arrested in federal indictment alleging murder, drug trafficking.

They are legally distinguished from religious orders ‚Äì the other major type of religious institute ‚Äì in that members take simple vows, whereas members of religious orders take solemn vows.  History  Until the 16th century, the vows taken in any of the religious orders approved by the Apostolic See were classified as solemn.Arthur Vermeersch, \\"Religious Life\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911 . Accessed 18 July 2011 This was declared by Pope Boniface VIII (1235‚Äì1303).\\"Illud solum votum debere dici solemne . . . quod solemnizatum fuerit per suceptionem S. Ordinis aut per professionem expressam vel tacitam factam alicui de religionibus per Sedem Apostolicam approbatis\\" (C. unic. de voto, tit. 15, lib. III in 6, quoted in Celestine Anthony Freriks, Religious Congregations in Their External Relations, p. 17). According to this criterion, the last religious order founded was that of the Bethlehem Brothers in 1673.√Ålvarez G√≥mez, Jes√∫s, C.M.F., Historia de la vida religiosa, Volume III, Publicaciones Claretianas, Madrid, 1996. By the constitution Inter cetera of 20 January 1521, Pope Leo X appointed a rule for tertiaries with simple vows. Under this rule, enclosure was optional, enabling non-enclosed followers of the rule to engage in various works of charity not allowed to enclosed religious. In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval. Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to social service and to evangelization, both in Europe and in mission areas. Their number increased further in the upheavals brought by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of monks and nuns of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living their religious life. Only on almost the last day of the 19th century were they officially reckoned as religious, when Pope Leo XIII recognized as religious all men and women who took simple vows in such congregations.Constitution \\"Conditae a Christo\\" of 8 December 1900, cited in Mary Nona McGreal, Dominicans at Home in a New Nation, chapter 11 The 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the name \\"religious order\\" for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term \\"religious congregation\\" or simply \\"congregation\\" for those with simple vows. The members of a religious order for men were called \\"regulars\\", those belonging to a religious congregation were simply \\"religious\\", a term that applied also to regulars. For women, those with simple vows were simply \\"sisters\\", with the term \\"nun\\" reserved in canon law for those who belonged to an institute of solemn vows, even if in some localities they were allowed to take simple vows instead. However, it abolished the distinction according to which solemn vows, unlike simple vows, were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious vows and thereby abrogated spiritually, though not altogether juridically, Latin-Rite religious orders. Solemn vows were originally considered indissoluble. Not even the Pope could dispense from them.Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, II‚ÄìII, q. 88, a.11 If for a just cause a solemnly professed religious was expelled, the vow of chastity remained unchanged and so rendered invalid any attempt at marriage, the vow of obedience obliged in relation, generally, to the bishop rather than to the religious superior, and the vow of poverty was modified to meet the new situation, but the expelled religious \\"could not, for example, will any goods to another; and goods which came to him reverted at his death to his institute or to the Holy See\\". After publication of the 1917 Code, many institutes with simple vows appealed to the Holy See for permission to make solemn vows. The Apostolic Constitution Sponsa Christi of 21 November 1950 made access to that permission easier for nuns (in the strict sense), though not for religious institutes dedicated to apostolic activity. Many of these institutes of women then petitioned for the solemn vow of poverty alone. Towards the end of the Second Vatican Council, superiors general of clerical institutes and abbots president of monastic congregations were authorized to permit, for a just cause, their subjects of simple vows who made a reasonable request to renounce their property except for what would be required for their sustenance if they were to depart, thus assimilating their position to that of religious with solemn vows.Y≈´ji Sugawara, Religious Poverty: from Vatican Council II to the 1994 Synod of Bishops (Loyola Press 1997 ), pp. 127‚Äì128 These changes resulted in a blurring of the previously clear distinction between \\"orders\\" and \\"congregations\\", since institutes that were founded as \\"congregations\\" began to have some members who had all three solemn vows or had members that took a solemn vow of poverty and simple vows of chastity and obedience.  Current juridicial status  The 1983 Code of Canon Law maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows, but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects, including the distinction between orders and congregations. It uses the single term religious institute to designate all such institutes of consecrated life alike.Robert T. Kennedy, Study related to a pre-1983 book by John J. McGrath ‚Äì Jurist, 1990, pp. 351‚Äì401 The word congregation () is instead used to refer to congregations of the Roman Curia or monastic congregations. The Annuario Pontificio lists for both men and women the institutes of consecrated life and the like that are of pontifical right, namely those that the Holy See has erected or approved by formal decree.Code of Canon Law, canon 589 For the men, it gives what it calls the \\"Historical-Juridical List of Precedence\\".Annuario Pontificio 2012, pp. 1411‚Äì1429 This list maintains to a large extent the distinction between orders and congregations, detailing 96 clerical religious congregations and 34 lay religious congregations. However, it does not distinguish between orders and congregations of Eastern Catholic Churches or female religious institutes.

In 711 CE, his kingdom was conquered by the Ummayad Caliphate led by Arab General Muhammad bin Qasim. He was killed at the Battle of Aror at the banks of the Indus River, near modern- day Nawabshah. His family name is now carried as Dahri‚Äôs clan known to be now living in district Nawabshah & Sanghar  Reign in the Chach Nama  The Chach Nama is the oldest chronicles of the Arab conquest of Sindh. It was translated in Persian by an Arab Muhammad Ali bin Hamid bin Abu Bakr Kufi in 1216 CECommon Era year is an approximation of the Islamic calendar date 613 AH. from an earlier Arabic text believed to have been written by the Thaqafi family (relatives of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi). Dahir's kingdom was invaded by King Ramal of Kannauj.  War with the Umayyads  The primary reason cited in the Chach Nama for the expedition by the governor of Basra, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, against Raja Dahir, was a pirate raid off the coast of Debal resulting in gifts to the caliph from the king of Serendib (modern Sri Lanka) being stolen.Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg: The Chachnamah, An Ancient History of Sind, Giving the Hindu period down to the Arab Conquest. Commissioners Press 1900, Section 18: \\"It is related that the king of Sarandeb* sent some curiosities and presents from the island of pearls, in a small fleet of boats by sea, for Hajj√°j. He also sent some beautiful pearls and valuable jewels, as well as some Abyssinian male and female slaves, some pretty presents, and unparalleled rarities to the capital of the Khal√≠fah. A number of Mussalman women also went with them with the object of visiting the Kaabah, and seeing the capital city of the Khal√≠fahs. When they arrived in the province of K√°zr√∫n, the boat was overtaken by a storm, and drifting from the right way, floated to the coast of Debal. Here a band of robbers, of the tribe of Nag√°mrah, who were residents of Debal, seized all the eight boats, took possession of the rich silken clothes they contained, captured the men and women, and carried away all the valuable property and jewels.\\" Meds (a tribe of Scythians living in Sindh) also known as Bawarij had pirated upon Sassanid shipping in the past, from the mouth of the Tigris to the Sri Lankan coast, in their bawarij and now we're able to prey on Arab shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar. Sindh in 700 CE, under the Raja's dynasty. The Umayyad Caliphate can be seen advancing upon the western frontier of the Indian subcontinent. Hajaj's next campaign was launched under the aegis of Muhammad bin Qasim. In 711 bin Qasim attacked at Debal and, on orders of Al-Hajjaj, freed the earlier captives and prisoners from the previous (failed) campaign. Other than this instance, the policy was generally one of enlisting and co-opting support from defectors and defeated lords and forces. From Debal bin Qasim moved on to Nerun for supplies; the city's Buddhist governor had acknowledged it as a tributary of the Caliphate after the first campaign and capitulated to the second. Qasim's armies then captured Siwistan (Sehwan) received allegiance from several tribal chiefs and secured the surrounding regions. His combined forces captured the fort at Sisam and secured the region west of the Indus River. By enlisting the support of local tribes Meds and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate. Sometime before the final battle, Dahar's vizier approached him and suggested that Dahar should take refuge with one of the friendly kings of India. \\"You should say to them, 'I am a wall between you and the Arab army. If I fall, nothing will stop your destruction at their hands.'\\" If that wasn't acceptable to Dahar, said the vizier, then he should at least send away his family to some safe point in India. Dahar refused to do either. \\"I cannot send away my family to security while the families of my thakurs and nobles remain here.\\" Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 671, killing him. After Dahar was killed in the Battle of Aror on the banks of the River Indus, his head was cut off from his body and sent to Hajjaj bin Yousuf. Three women from Chachnama Three women from Chachnama, Dahar's wife, Queen Ladi, and Dahar's daughters Suriya and Preemal carry equal weight in the cultural memory of Sindhi and the broader Indian past. The stories are recited to explicate the nationhood of Sindh to argue against imperial aggressors. These women are seen as proud, daring personifications of ancient Sindhi culture that resisted conquest.

This historic territory mostly covers today‚Äôs South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia, and part of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, Russia, and parts of Racha and Khevi historical regions in Georgia. Etymology Circa 19th century photo of Dvali family sisters. The name of the Dvals (, ) is found in old Georgian annals. Their land was called Dvaleti (·Éì·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éî·Éó·Éò. Dvalet\`i) after them. The ethnonym survived to modern times as \\"Twal\\" and \\"Urs-Twal\\" ( meaning \\"white Twals\\"). The Georgian surname Dvali (·Éì·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò), Dvalishvili (·Éì·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò) and Ossetian Tuallagov/Twall√¶gt√¶ also come from the name Dvals. History When the Mongols destroyed the Alanian kingdom in the Northern Caucasus in the 13th‚Äì14th centuries, the Ossetes migrated across the Caucasus mountains. In a part of Dvaletia they formed their community called Tuall√§g. The Dvals were pushed southward and, as a result, the process of their assimilation into the Georgians and Ossetes accelerated. By the early 18th century it was complete. The term Dvaleti retained only a geographic meaning, narrowed to refer solely to the area around the Kudaro valley in the west (modern-day Java district in South Ossetia/Shida Kartli). Language and origin There are different theories about the Dvals origins. Nakh theory According to a number of historians and linguists, the Dvals probably spoke a Nakh language.–ì–∞–º—Ä–µ–∫–µ–ª–∏ –í. –ù. –î–≤–∞–ª—ã –∏ –î–≤–∞–ª–µ—Ç–∏—è –≤ I‚ÄîXV –≤–≤. –Ω. —ç. –¢–±–∏–ª–∏—Å–∏, 1961 page 138–ú–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—à–≤–∏–ª–∏ –ì. –ê. –ö –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–º–∞–ª–æ–∞–∑–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏–∫–∏. –í–î–ò, 1962,1 page 62Jaimoukha, Amjad.

The Kakh(etians) who used to call themselves Kabatsas and their territory Kakh- batsa, were surrounded by Nakh tribes and themselves thought to be Tushians of Nakh extraction. The eighteenth century historian Vakhushti asserted that the Kakh considered Gligvs, Dzurdzuks and Kists as their ethnic kin.\\"GamrekeliMelikishvilli Gamrekeli (a Georgian historian) provides the typical version of the Nakh theory, stating that the Dvals had a language clearly distinct from that of the Ossetes (who eventually migrated onto their land) and akin (but not equivalent to) to the Vainakh languages. Backing the theory that the Dvals were Nakh are numerous sources. *The people directly to their West (the Malkh; in the northern part of their territory in Southern North Ossetia-\\"Alania\\"; not the South Caucasian part where the Svans bordered them) are already more or less confirmed to be Nakh in origin. *There is evidence produced by the German Caucasologist, Heinz F√§hnrich, of extensive Nakh-Svan contact before the advent of Iranian-speaking invaders. Thus, in order to have extensive contact with the Svans, enough for the strong Nakh influence detected by F√§hnrich in Svan, a Nakh people must have lived close to them. However, without the Dvals or at least a people who lived on their territory before them being Nakh, this could not have happened, as the Malkh, the closest people, lived across one of the most difficult parts of the Caucasus, and to this day the modern inhabitants of Malkhia and the Svans have little if any contact with each other.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: a handbook. Page 26. https://books.google.com/books?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&pg;=PA29&lpg;=PA29&dq;=Dvals+Chechens+Jaimoukha&source;=bl&ots;=cBdGsyn3uD&sig;=S-_XrHPwTc3lxot38j3IAPN1JBc&hl;=en&ei;=65EfTKixK4G78ga4mvGRDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=3&ved;=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q;=Fahnrich&f;=false. \\"Heinz Fahnrich (1988) identified lexical traces of Nakh-Svan contact before the advent of the Iranians\\" The Georgian historian Melikishvilli argued, using the similarity in name to the old Vainakh clan Dvali, that the Dvals were akin to the Vainakh (i.e. a Nakh people) but distinct and that a remnant of them became absorbed by the Vainakh proper (as was confirmed happened with actually confirmed Nakh peoples, such as the Malkh after they declined). * Kuznetsov notes the presence of Nakh placenames in South- and North Ossetia: including Tsei, Leah and Leah-hee (Liakhvi). * Almost all historians agree that the Dvals were not Alans. If they were really Scythians, it would be unlikely that they would have diverged so sharply in such a small area; especially considering that in the Caucasus, many peoples that no longer formed an ethnic unity and already had been separated for a long period were still considered as one. Ossetian theory Another theory is that the Dvals were an Ossetian speaking people. According to this, they were among first Ossetes to settle in the southern Caucasus. Evidence for the Ossetian theory also draws from various elements: *In 1957 an example of text thought by some to be Dval was found in Dvaleti. It was written with a Syrian-nestorian writing system. :Original text, provided by Turchanikov: ::hcawj acgar ama[r]di a jnn mishnq jtkajin ish kwtwn ljkchh khnkn dan aljka ja ctj (m) mhhh at r k jz azj :Translation to english :Modern Ossetic form: ::Xwycwy agcar amardi a jyn mysinag y tyxa jyn yz kotton ... :Translation to english Ossetian tribes (according to B. A. Kaloev).http://s50.radikal.ru/i129/1003/22/2fec9d793e3d.jpg *Much of former Dvaleti is now populated by Ossetes. Although the Dvals were clearly not Alans, similarity could have aided the assimilation of the remainder of the conquered Dvals *Modern day Ossetes living in the old territory of the Dvals (who some believe to be partially descended from the Dvals), are called Tuals in the north and Urs-Tuals in the south, and speak the Tual dialect of the Ossetic language.  Georgian theory Throughout the history of Georgian statehood, even after its inclusion into the Russian Empire, Dvaleti had always been considered an integral part of Kartli. From the 15th century on Ossetians start to settle in Dvaleti province, located in the Northern part of the main Caucasus Range. This continued throughout the 16th century, while in the 17th century, assimilation of the local Georgian ethnic group of Dvalians draws to its end. Before the settlement of Ossetians in Dvaleti, a major part of the Dvalians had migrated to different parts of Georgia: Shida Kartli, Kvemo Kartli, Imereti, Racha.http://www.nplg.gov.ge/dlibrary/collect/0001/000355/inglisuri%20osebis%20texti.pdf Russia annexed Kartli-Kakheti in 1801 along with Dvaleti. In 1858 Dvaleti was administratively detached from Tiflis Governorate, and attached to the Tersky district of Russia. Vakhushti Bagrationi pointed out that ‚Äúthe language they speak is old, Dvalian, but presently they use Ossetian as if it were their native tongue‚Äù.Vakhushti Bagrationi, Description of the Georgian Kingdom, Kartlis Ckhovreba (History of Georgia). Georgian text, V. IV, publ.S. Kaukhchishvili, Tb. 1973, p. 755. V. Gamrrekeli regarded Dvalians Vainakhs, Kartvelian Vainakhs to be more exact. V. Gamrekeli believed that the Kartization of the Dvalians occurred in the 7th century, when the Kartlian population, fatigued by the Arab rule, had migrated. The author later changed his views, and in an article published in Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia he recognized the Dvalians as Kartvelian tribes, namely Zans. Some scholars point that they were not exactly Zan but represented one the Kartvelian languages. The last of the Georgian authors to address the issue of Dvalian origins was B. Gamkrelidze, who arrived at the conclusion that ‚ÄúDvaleti, from ancient times, culturally, and administratively had always been an integral part of the Georgian world‚Ä≥. Another detail to prove their Kartvelian origin is the absence of crypts in Dvaleti. Crypts were encountered only in Chechnya and Ingushetia,Markovin V. I. On the Development of Crypt Constructions in North Caucasus ‚Äì Issues of Old and medieval archaeology of East Europe., M, 1978. while Chechens and Ingush were recognized as skillful builders and used to build the crypts not only in their native lands but in neighbouring Ossetia as well.Abramova T. P. Kumi site burial chambers; M. 1987. It is suggested that if the Dvalians had been related to the Vainakhs, the culture of crypt building would have existed among them as well. Accomplishments The most prominent Dvals were, perhaps, the 11th‚Äì13th calligraphers ‚Äì John, Michael, Stephen, and George ‚Äì who worked at various Georgian Orthodox monasteries abroad, chiefly in Jerusalem and at the Mount Athos, and created several fine examples of old Georgian manuscripts, e.g. The Months and The Vitae of St Basil (John the Dval, circa 1055), and the so-called Labechini Gospels (George the Dval, 13th century). Another famous Dval calligrapher was Vola Tliag ( meaning \\"Vola from Tli\\") who worked over Kapelle of Nuzal.Kuznetsov V. The light of Christianity in Georgia. Dvaletia (from the book \\"Christianity in the North Caucasus\\") The Orthodox church venerates also the memory of St Nicholas of Dvaletia, a Dval monk from the Georgian monastery at Jerusalem, who was martyred, on October 19, 1314, at the order of Amir Denghiz for having preached Christianity. He was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church.  See also  *History of Georgia  References  Further reading  *Gagloity Y. Formation of the southern branch of Ossetian people *Gamrekeli V.

The wilderness is named for its high steep walls that narrow in the lower section so that they block the light in the morning and late afternoon. The roughly horseshoe-shaped wilderness is made up of the upper part of Dark Canyon and two major tributaries, Woodenshoe Canyon and Peavine Canyon in the Manti-La Sal National Forest. These canyons all descend from pine-covered Elk Ridge northeast of Natural Bridges National Monument. Dark Canyon continues west within a U.S. Bureau of Land Management primitive area that is recommended for wilderness designation. The last of the main canyon drop steeply through Glen Canyon National Recreation Area into Lake Powell. On December 28, 2016 President Barack Obama proclaimed the 1.35 million acre Bears Ears National Monument, that includes both the Dark Canyon Wilderness and the adjacent Dark Canyon Primitive Area. Life zones range from ponderosa pine and aspen-covered high country to desert vegetation in the bottom of Dark Canyon. High terraced castle-like sandstone walls tower above the canyon floors. Wildlife species include mule deer, some mountain lions, black bear and bighorn sheep. This diverse canyon country contains arches, springs, seeps and hanging gardens. Water sources in Dark Canyon are often widely separated, and some have dried up entirely in recent drought years. Thunderstorms can result in powerful flash floods that scour the canyon streambeds. Wilderness visitors may see evidence of the Ancestral Puebloan culture. All the trails dropping into the canyons are moderate but they can be difficult, if not impossible, to find and follow until you reach the bottoms of the canyons. Peavine Canyon contains a cherry-stem jeep trail. The Forest Service once recommended closing the area to vehicles but this corridor was kept open as a compromise in the Utah Wilderness Act of 1984.

Apart from his career in politics, Harun Idris (as he is informally known) was heavily involved in sports particularly organising the Muhammad Ali vs Joe Bugner fight in Kuala Lumpur as well as overseeing Malaysia and Selangor football teams' most successful periods. Harun was the president of the Football Association Selangor from 1961-1983 and was the manager of the Malaysian National team in the 1972 Olympics. Harun is widely acknowledged to be responsible for unearthing some of Malaysia‚Äôs best talents such as Dato Santokh Singh, Dato Soh Chin Aun and even the late Mokhar Dahari. Early life Harun was born in Petaling, Selangor on 21 July 1925. His early schooling was in both malay and english mediums (He attended Victoria Institute in 1936) and in the 1940s he joined the Malayan Peoples‚Äô Anti- Japanese Army against the Japanese occupation of Malaya.Tan, Chee Khoon & Vasil, Raj (ed., 1984). Without Fear or Favour, p. 55. Eastern Universities Press. . He was one of the founders of the Selangor Malays Union, and joined UMNO in 1949 Subsequently he joined the Malay Administrative Service and worked as an assistant district officer in the districts of Gemas and Tampin. The year 1951 saw him serve under Malaysia‚Äôs first PM Tunku Abdul Rahman as a magistrate in Kuala Lumpur. Two years later his good work earned him a scholarship to read law in Middle Temple, England. Returning two years later, Dato Harun held the position of the President of the Sessions Court in Taiping. When Malaya gained her independence in 1957, Dato Harun was made a Deputy Public Prosecutor and was later the Acting Registrar of Societies and the Official Assignee of the Federation of Malaya. A year later, he was appointed the State Legal Adviser for Selangor. The call from a career in politics was too strong to resist and in 1964 Dato Harun resigned from said position and was appointed as Menteri Besar of Selangor after being elected the state assemblyman for the constituency of Morib. Political career In March 1964, having won the State Assembly seat for Morib, Selangor, Dato Seri Harun was elected to the UMNO Supreme Council and served as Selangor Umno liaison chief from 1964 to 1976. From 1964 to 1976, Dato Seri Harun was appointed the eighth Chief Minister of Selangor, after Datuk Abu Bakar Baginda and he was the longest serving Chief Minister of Selangor, holding office for exactly 12 years, until his resignation in April 1976. From the early 1970s until 1976, Harun was the Head of Umno Youth and Supreme Council member. He was then expelled from UMNO and charged with corruption by the government, due to his abuse of state funds.Tan & Vasil, pp. 58, 59. The chief investigating officer on the corruption case (16 counts of corruption) was Ang Chooi Tuan KMN, AMN, the highest ranking Anti-Corruption Agency non-Malay/non-UMNO officer. Harun's career was marred by the 13 May racial riots, which had been triggered by a political rally held at his residence in the national capital of Kuala Lumpur. Harun, who was perceived as a proponent of ketuanan Melayu (Malay supremacy, although this exact phrase was not in use at the time), had seen UMNO suffer several losses in the Selangor State Assembly during the 1969 general election. As a result, the opposition held a celebration rally in the state, a counter rally was then held with Malays gathering at Idris' house in Kampong Baru, which quickly spiralled out of control. The discipline of those at the rally soon broke down, and the rally turned into a riot which lasted two days and cost at least 180 lives. Harun's role in the riot is not exactly clear and reports are conflicting. On one hand it is claimed that he was responsible for ordering the counter-rally, and even as far as supplying the Malays who gathered at his house with knives and machetes. Another report states that after meeting in large numbers at Harun's official residence in Jalan Raja Muda near Kampong Bahru, and hearing inflammatory speeches by Harun and other leaders, the Malay mobs prepared themselves by tying ribbon strips on their foreheads and set out to kill Chinese. The first victims of the riots were two Chinese that were in a van opposite Idris' house watching the large gathering. On the other, some claim that Dato Harun had worked to de-escalate the situation, even saving a number of Chinese people that were being targeted by Malay rioters. One of them was the late Tan Chee Khoon, the then-Leader of the Opposition. In an article written on 24 June 1981 titled 'Datuk Harun and the May 13 Tragedy', Chee Khoon exonerates Harun by arguing that 1) Dato Harun was too busy organising the formation of the Selangor State Government and as a result could not have organised the counter-rally 2) According to intelligence sources, various armed groups had infiltrated Kuala Lumpur with malicious intent 3) Dato Harun had drove a number of Chinese people in this car to the Campbell Road Police Station Chee Khoon concludes the article by writing ‚ÄòI have related this story not with the idea of reviving an old controversy but to show that Datuk Harun was not out for the blood of chinese in those days of tragedy as claimed in some quarters‚Äô Harun's political career did not stop after stepping down as Chief Minister. Between 1975 and 1977, he was found guilty on various charges of corruption including forging minutes of a meeting for the purpose of cheating the bank by pledging its stocks to the First National City Bank (now Citibank) to get letters of credit for Tinju Dunia Sdn Bhd to stage the Muhammad Ali vs Joe Bugner fight, causing Bank Rakyat to lose RM7.9mil.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/08/31/several-top-brass- engulfed-in-scandals-in-the-past/#lt7PBGH4R1IrQAti.99 and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. In 1981, Harun was released after receiving a pardon from the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong on advice of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, after serving three years of his sentence.Cheah, pg 206 He served as Kuala Langat Umno Division Chief for 3 years until 1984. Dato Seri Harun also served as a council member of the Selangor Royal Council from 1994 until his demise. On 15 November 1986 he was called to the Malaysian Bar and thereafter returned to his old profession of law practice and became a senior partner of Harun Idris, Yeoh & Partners actively practising law until his demise. Harun served as Semangat 46 Supreme Council member and Selangor Chief for a brief period from 1987 to 1990. In the year 2000, Dato Seri Harun rejoined Umno and was a member of the Umno SS7 Sri Dagang Branch, in the Subang Division of Selangor. Dato Seri Harun died after a short illness on 19 October 2003 at the age of 78 and is survived by his wife Datin Seri Salmah Sulaiman, three sons, three daughters, 18 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.

Studios are located in Aurora and the transmitter is located in Brighton. The 710 KNUS weekday lineup includes local hosts Peter Boyles, Steffan Tubbs, with Randy Corporon, Mike Boyle, Jimmy Sengenberger, and Matt Dunn handling weekend shifts. 710 KNUS is similar to many of Salem's other talk stations, airing hosts Dennis Prager, Hugh Hewitt, Mark Levin, and Sebastian Gorka. 710 KNUS is a CBS Radio News affiliate and a member of the Associated Press and winner of the Colorado Broadcasters Association's 2018 Best Regularly Scheduled Newscast award. History of 710 KNUS 710 KNUS came on the air as KMYR in May, 1941 on 1340 kHz. It moved to 710 kHz in April, 1956. When it was KBTR-AM it had a news partnership with then KBTV now KUSA-TV this ended sometime in the mid 80's. From the 1970s to late 1980s it was owned by Mullins Broadcasting. In the late 1980s, the station changed its name to KBXG when it was bought by a Boulder coal company. In the 1990s, the station was the home of Ken Hamblin, Gary Tessler, Alan Dumas, Carol McKinley, Nia Bender, Pierre Wolfe, Mason Lewis, Warren Byrne, Gabby Gourmet, Ron Krieter, and many others. At one point in 1991, it had Peter Boyles 5:00 am till 9:00 am, Gary Tessler 9:00 till 1:00. Ken Hamblin 1:00 till 4:00, Jim Turner 4:00 till 8:00 and Jann Scott 8:00 till Midnight.

The dots represent DOF limits for and 16; the dots indicate that the lens is focused at approximately the hyperfocal distance for 16, about 13 feet. Jacobson's inferred circle of confusion diameter, using c = f\\\\,^2 / (N H), was about 0.025 mm. In photographic optics, the Zeiss formula is a supposed formula for computing a circle of confusion (CoC) criterion for depth of field (DoF) calculations. The formula is c = d/1730, where d is the diagonal measure of a camera format, film, sensor, or print, and c the maximum acceptable diameter of the circle of confusion. The Zeiss formula is apocryphal, in the sense that it has grown to be a well-known named concept by propagation through the internet, even though it has no official origin, little connection to Carl Zeiss Company, and no recognition or usage in the photographic industry outside the web community. The number 1/1730 derives from a circle of confusion diameter of 0.025 mm on a full-frame 35 mm film format, with diagonal size about 43.25 mm (43.25/0.025 is 1730). The CoC size of 0.025 mm for this format appears in Jacobson's Photographic Lenses Tutorial, and the 1730 in his 1996 Photographic Lenses FAQ. Jacobson derived the 0.025 mm CoC number from analysis of the Zeiss Triotar lens DoF markings on the Rollei B35 (see photo). The manual for the Rollei B35 also states 0.025 mm CoC for its tabulated DoF distances, though it also includes an example DoF reading that implies a larger CoC. By 2001, the term \\"Zeiss formula\\" had appeared, in the manual for the on-line DoF calculator f/calc.

Usually they were sent by their parents to become seasonal workers. They were taken in spring and brought to the child markets in Germany, mainly in Upper Swabia, where they would be purchased or \\"rented\\" by farmers for the season. This use of children as workers was most widespread in the 19th century. The march over the Alps to Germany proved often difficult and exhausting. Usually their guide was a priest, who was also responsible for ensuring the children had a warm stable to sleep in. The marches were large, organised groups of several thousand children, taken over the snow-covered mountains often still dressed in rags. It was not uncommon for five and six- year-old children to be taken. The American press began a campaign in 1908 exposing the Swabian children, describing the child market in Friedrichshafen as a \\"barely concealed slave market\\". The child markets were abolished in 1915, yet the trade of children did not end completely until compulsory schooling for foreign children was introduced in W√ºrttemberg in 1921. Many immigration certificates from Swabia show surnames typical of Tyrol and other regions the children were taken from (e.g. Braxmeier from Braxmarer).

Conducted at 227 American universities, it offered training in such fields as engineering, foreign languages, and medicine. The ASTP differed from the V-12 Navy College Training Program in producing technically trained personnel rather than officers as its primary goal, though recruits were told that they had the opportunity to become officers upon completion. The program was approved in September 1942 and implemented in December of that year. History=Inception After the attack on Pearl Harbor sparked U.S. entry into the war, the Army suspended certain advanced elements of Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) training. This was a particularly problematic situation for the nation's numerous land-grant universities, whose constitutions include the legal agreement to train \\"militia.\\" A program which could provide a \\"continuous and accelerated flow of high grade technicians and specialists needed by the Army\\" would both help the war effort, offset ROTC enrollment turndown, and keep universities operating when most, if not all, male students would be absent. Colonel Herman Beukema, a professor of history at West Point, was named director of the Army Specialized Training Program, responsible for sending over 200,000 soldiers to 227 colleges at cost of $127,000,000. The program was proposed in September 1942, formally announced in December 1942, and began with a pilot program on college campuses in the spring of 1943. A maximum of 150,000 men were authorized to be enrolled in the program at any one time. =Army Specialized Training Reserve Program= During the late part of the 1942‚Äì1943 academic year, a national testing program was conducted among the male college and high school student bodies to determine acceptance into the ASTP or the V-12 college training program. A maximum of 25,000 high school graduates were offered scholarships through the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program (ASTRP). Examinees had to be older than 17 but not older than 18 years old, designate \\"Army\\" preference, meet or exceed the cutoff of the test (approximately one standard deviation minimum above the mean), and enlist in the Enlisted Reserve Corps and be found physically qualified for general military service. Reservists were called to active duty at the end of the academic term in which they turned 18. Institutions Unlike the Navy's V-12 college training program, the Army's criteria for the ASTP predominantly favored large, state flagship institutions. All colleges and universities having advanced ROTC programs (i.e., all land-grant universities) were assigned to have ASTP detachments. If an institution had an engineering program, it had to be accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. No institution would be chosen to have programs of two or more services (ASTP. Army Air Forces College Training Program or Navy V-12) unless it could accommodate a total of 1,000 or more trainees. Only 53 institutions had programs of two services and just two (the University of Minnesota and Pennsylvania State University) sponsored all three. By the fall of 1943, the Army had 321 ASTP contracts with 227 different institutions. Six of these were historically black colleges and universities: Howard University; Meharry Medical College; North Carolina A&T; Prairie View State College; West Virginia State College; Wilberforce University. StudentsRequirements= Entry requirements were high. Potential candidates included all enlisted men who were completing or who had completed basic training and had scored at least 110 (later 115) on the Army General Classification Test, a Stanford-Binet-type IQ test, compared to 110 for OCS candidates. Score requirements for certain specific programs were even higher. If under 22 years old, they had to have completed high school or its equivalent along with specified mathematics courses; if older than 22 years old, a minimum of one year of college, and \\"substantial background\\" in one or more languages, or a year of mathematics and physics, or biology. =DemographicsCivilians During the national testing program, roughly 400,000 civilians were tested for pre-induction eligibility for the ASTP. Additional tests were conducted in November 1943 and March 1944. Soldiers The majority of participants in the ASTP were already on active duty in the Army. Enlisted men were also given the qualifying test, and accepted only at the rank of private. In the spring of 1942, the Army had allowed men in colleges and universities studying specific subjects to enlist in the Enlisted Reserve Corps and defer a call to active duty until they had completed their degree requirements, left or dropped out, or were called to active duty by the Secretary of War; one in seven chose to do so. The director of the War Manpower Commission announced in August 1942 that the destiny of all male students would be the armed forces, and the Secretary of War soon announced the termination of the program effective in the spring of 1943. Reservists who had been found qualified for further training under the ASTP were sent to basic training, and then assessed again when they returned. Because so many men had graduated from ROTC and received commissions ‚Äî 93,000 by March 1942, outnumbering Regular Army officers by three to one ‚Äî men who wanted to advance had few choices. Moving up through the ASTP seemed like a promising alternative. ROTC The advanced ROTC program was suspended in its entirety in the spring of 1943 and no new contracts were issued for the duration of the war. The basic ROTC was kept intact as part of the military indoctrination for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program. Several major categories of ROTC students existed: * Members of the normal college class of 1942, who had completed a full four-year program plus the summer camp. * Members of the normal college class of 1943 who had chosen to accelerate their studies via summer sessions offered in 1942 that gave a full semester or quarter of credit. These men graduated with a completed advanced course minus the summer camp at the end of 1942 if on the semester calendar, or in the early spring of 1943 if on the quarter calendar. These men, along with the members of the normal class of 1943, then went directly to officer candidate schools. * Members of the normal college class of 1944 who had taken the 1942 summer session. These men graduated in the fall of 1943 with a partially-complete (either three semesters out of four, or four quarters out of six) advanced course. These men also went directly to officer candidate school, although some men attending institutions on the quarter calendar were allowed to remain in school through the summer quarter to ease congestion in officer candidate schools. * Members of the normal college class of 1945 who had taken the 1942 summer session, called \\"ROTC juniors.\\" If their institution was on the semester calendar, they were due to begin advanced ROTC in the spring semester of 1943. They, along with the remaining members of the normal class of 1944, were sent to basic training after the spring semester ended. After returning from basic training in the early fall of 1943, The ROTC juniors were allowed to resume their civilian curricula at the institutions they were attending or act as instructors in basic ROTC, which functioned as military indoctrination for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program, until called to officer candidate school. These men were only attached to the ASTP for administrative purposes. Course The highly accelerated ASTP was offered at 227 land-grant universities around the country. Class sessions were in twelve-week terms, with a break of one week between terms. Intensive courses were offered in engineering, science, medicine, dentistry, personnel psychology, and over 30 different foreign languages, with a different number of terms required to complete each. Most subject areas were divided into two phases, the first (\\"basic\\") phase covering general education in a subject, and the second (\\"advanced\\") phase covering instruction in a specific area. { class=\\"wikitable floatcenter\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text- align:center;\\" +Engineering - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\\" !

Recruits marched to class in groups (the Army stipulated that they be taught separately from civilian students or other military students on campuses), ate in mess halls located in their barracks, and trained in the fields around a campus. The soldiers' week featured fifty-nine hours of \\"supervised activity,\\" including at least twenty- four of classroom and lab work, twenty-four of required study, six of physical instruction, and five of military instruction. At its height in December 1943, about 145,000 men were enrolled in the program. By November 1943 the Army was having difficulties integrating men who received the specialized ASTP training back into their old units, and recognized that, with the manpower being consumed, the program was not producing nearly enough new officers for the Army Ground Forces. The Army was legally obligated to accommodate ROTC graduates (large numbers of whom became eligible from the spring of 1943 to the spring of 1944) in officer candidate schools first, and could not also accommodate the number of ASTP graduates being produced without eliminating officer applicants from units and installations entirely. As the requirements for overseas replacements intensified and the output of replacement training centers began to fall off precipitously just as the first large waves of ASTP students graduated in the spring and summer of 1943, no quotas for them ever ended up being allotted to any officer candidate schools. Few, if any, ASTP men ever got the opportunity to become officers. In January 1944, Colonel Beukema reported to a U.S. Congressional investigating committee that the requirements for the ASTP were more demanding than those of either West Point or the Naval Academy. Reduction Henry Stimson, Secretary of War during World War II and self-professed \\"father of the ASTP,\\" wrote: > Each step of the ASTP story was tied in with the ups and downs in the Army's > estimate of its manpower requirements. In all such changes, the college > training program, as a marginal undertaking, was sharply affected. [The > choice was] between specialized training and an adequate combatant force. General Lesley J. McNair felt, with the full extent of the poor morale and mental quality of U.S. combat troops being revealed in the winter of 1943, that the ASTP took young men with leadership potential away from combat positions where they were most needed. \\"...with 300,000 men short, we are sending men to college.\\" Manpower planners calculated that more infantrymen than expected would be required in advance of the planned invasion of Europe. The ASTP was not only one of the easiest programs to reduce or eliminate, but it also provided a large pool of already-trained soldiers. In mid-February 1944, about 110,000 ASTP students were told they would be transferred to more important duties by the beginning of April. Through the month of March 1944, all students in the basic programs, and some in the advanced programs, were gradually released and returned to the Army Ground or Service Forces or other branches of the Army. Of the 86,167 men terminated from academic programs, 68,995 went to the Army Ground Forces, 16,086 to the Army Service Forces (of which 7,535 went to the Signal Corps, 3,153 to the Corps of Engineers, 656 to the Transportation Corps, and 4,742 to other service branches), 568 to the War Department Military Intelligence Service, 274 to the Army Air Forces, 144 to the Army Civilian Affairs Division, and 100 to the Office of Strategic Services. The rest of the reduction consisted of men who left the program (either voluntarily or involuntarily) before they were terminated, about 12,000 men in STAR units whose processing was terminated, about 5,000 men in the advanced ROTC holding pools who departed for officer candidate schools, and men in basic training who had already been selected for the ASTP. The 17 year olds were continued in school until the age of 18, at which time they were transferred from the Organized Reserve to active duty and given their mandated basic training. After basic training, those who were willing were returned to the reduced number of land-grant schools still maintaining ASTP. From a wartime high of 145,000 students, the ASTP was immediately reduced to approximately 35,000 members. Those who had sacrificed non-commissioned rank to qualify for the college training were not necessarily reinstated, and often shortly went into combat as privates. Even though the ASTP men did not have the practical experience to qualify for non-commissioned officer rank, the Army anticipated that their superior training and intelligence levels would result in advancement to leadership positions. Graduates in action Around 73,000 former ASTP members were sent to units of the Army Ground Forces. 55,000 went to depleted stateside divisions that had been used as sources of overseas replacements after the output of replacement training centers had proven insufficient. About 35 divisions received an average of 1,500 men each, though some got considerably more, such as the 3,000 received by the 395th Infantry Regiment in March 1944. Fresh out of college, the new replacements were often given harsh receptions by both fellow officers and veteran NCOs. One company commander asked, \\"What kind of soldiers deal out bridge hands during their ten-minute training breaks?\\" ASTP personnel were often skeptical of the capabilities of their new superior officers and NCOs. However, once in combat, they rapidly proved their worth and any distinctions between the regular Army and the college soldiers were erased. In the spring of 1944, ASTP levels were further reduced at the direction of the Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall. The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps' continued to experience serious shortfalls in producing casualty replacements, necessitating the use of divisional service troops and Army Service Forces troops as infantry replacements. When the defeat of Germany was in sight, and the testing of the new atomic bomb successful, the apparent need for potential junior officer replacements disappeared and the final ASTP groups were largely disbanded, although there were ASTP units for medicine and engineering still existing in August 1945. Legacy While the ASTP initiative suffered from manpower drawdowns to meet immediate combat needs, it did serve as an important financial subsidy of land grant colleges whose male student bodies had been decimated by the diversion of about 14 million men into the various armed forces. Another positive effect of the ASTP effort was a softening of university resistance to lowering the draft age from twenty to eighteen. Finally, and most far-reaching, it exposed a large number of potentially very capable men to college who might not have attended otherwise. After the war ended, fully four out of five surviving ASTP alumni returned to college. Still, critical views were held. A highly dismissive opinion was expressed by Major General Harry L. Twaddle, a former Army Assistant Chief of Staff G-3, who wrote, \\"The underlying reason for institution of the ASP [sic] program was to prevent some colleges and universities from going into bankruptcy. From a strictly mobilization viewpoint, the value of the program was nil.\\" Notable alumni Notable alumni of the ASTP include: *Mel Brooks, American actor, filmmaker, and composer *Heywood Hale Broun, sports commentator *Frank Church, U.S. Senator * Bill Dawson, prominent California attorney *Bob Dole, U.S. Senator and Senate Majority Leader *Herman Kahn, futurist and theorist *Henry Kissinger, U.S. Secretary of State, Nobel Prize winner *Ed Koch, U.S. Congressman, New York City Mayor *George Koval, Russian spy in Manhattan Project World War II *Arch Moore, former Governor of West Virginia *Peter A.

He was also Home Minister of first Provisional Government of India established in Afghanistan in 1915. Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi was the Life Member of Jamia Millia Islamia, A Central University in New Delhi, India. He served the Jamia Millia Islamia for a long period of time on a very low salary. A boys' hostel in Dr. Zakir Husain Hall of Hall of Boys' Residence in Jamia Millia Islamia has been named after him. Early life and Education Ubaidullah was born on 10 March 1872Profile and commemorative postage stamp image of Ubaidullah Sindhi on findpk.com website Retrieved 7 March 2019 in an Uppal Khatri family in the district of Sialkot, Punjab, British India as Buta Singh Uppal. His father died four months before Ubaidullah was born, and the child was raised for two years by his paternal grandfather. Following the paternal grandfather's death, he was taken by his mother to the care of her father, at his maternal grandfather's house. Later, young Buta Singh was entrusted to the care of his uncle at Jampur Tehsil, Punjab, British India, when his maternal grandfather died. Buta Singh Uppal converted to Islam at age 15 and chose \\"Ubaidullah Sindhi\\" as his new name, and later enrolled in the Darul Uloom Deoband, where he was, at various times, associated with other noted Islamic scholars of the time, including Maulana Rasheed Gangohi and Maulana Mahmud al-Hasan. Maulana Sindhi returned to the Darul Uloom Deoband in 1909, and gradually involved himself in the Pan-Islamic movement. During World War I, he was among the leaders of the Deoband School, who, led by Maulana Mahmud al-Hasan, left India to seek support among other nations of the world for a Pan-Islamic revolution in India in what came to be known as the Silk Letter Conspiracy. Ubaidullah had reached Kabul during the war to rally the Afghan Amir Habibullah Khan, and after a brief period there, he offered his support to Raja Mahendra Pratap's plans for revolution in British India with German support. He joined the Provisional Government of India formed in Kabul in December 1915, and remained in Afghanistan until the end of World War I, and then left for Russia. He subsequently spent two years in Turkey and, passing through many countries, eventually reached Hijaz (Saudi Arabia) where he spent about 14 years learning and pondering over the philosophy of Islam especially in the light of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi's works. In his early career he was a Pan-Islamic thinker. However, after his studies of Shah Waliullah's works, Ubaidullah Sindhi emerged as non-Pan-Islamic scholar. He was one of the most active and prominent members of the faction of Indian Freedom Movement led by Muslim clergy chiefly from the Islamic School of Deoband. Ubaidullah Sindhi was a great freedom fighter of India. Conversion to Islam  When he was at school, a Hindu friend gave him the book Tufatul Hind to read. It was written by a converted scholar Maulana Ubaidullah of Malerkotla. After reading this book and some other books like Taqwiyatul Eeman and Ahwaal ul Aakhira, Ubaidullah's interest in Islam grew, leading eventually to his conversion to Islam. In 1887, the year of his conversion, he moved from Punjab to Sindh area where he was taken as a student by Hafiz Muhammad Siddique of Chawinda (Bhar Chandi). He subsequently studied at Deen Pur village under Maulana Ghulam Muhammad where he delved deeper into Islamic education and training in the mystical order. In 1888, Ubaidullah was admitted to Darul Uloom Deoband, where he studied various Islamic disciplines in depth under the tutelage of noted Islamic scholars of the time including Maulana Abu Siraj, Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and Maulana Mahmud al Hasan. He took lessons in Sahih al-Bukhari and Tirmidhi from Maulana Nazeer Husain Dehalvi and read logic and philosophy with Maulana Ahmad Hasan Cawnpuri. In 1891, Ubaidullah graduated from the Deoband school. He left for Sukkur area in Sindh province, and started teaching in Amrote Shareef under, or with, Maulana Taj Mohammad Amrothi, who became his mentor after the death of Hafiz Muhammad Siddique of Bhar Chandi. Ubaidullah married the daughter of Maulana Azeemullah Khan, a teacher at Islamiyah High School, at that time. In 1901, Ubaidullah established the Darul Irshaad in Goth Peer Jhanda village in Sindh. He worked on propagating his school for nearly seven years. In 1909, at the request of Mahmud Al Hasan, he returned to Deoband School in Uttar Pradesh. Here, he accomplished much for the student body, Jamiatul Ansaar. Ubaidullah was now very active in covert anti-British propaganda activities, which led to him alienating a large number of the Deoband School leaders. Subsequently, Ubaidullah moved his work to Delhi at Mahmud al Hasan's request. At Delhi, he worked with Hakim Ajmal Khan and Dr. Ansari. In 1912, he established a madrassah, Nazzaaratul Ma'arif, which was successful in propagating and spreading Islam among the people. Attempt to involve Afghanistan's ruler  With the onset of World War I in 1914, efforts were made by the Darul Uloom Deoband to forward the cause of Pan-Islam in British India with the help of the other sympathetic nations of the world. Led by Mahmud al Hasan, plans were sketched out for an insurrection beginning in the tribal belt of North-West Frontier Province of British India. Mahmud al Hasan, left India to seek the help of Galib Pasha, the Turkish governor of Hijaz, while at Hasan's directions, Ubaidullah proceeded to Kabul to seek Emir Habibullah's support there. Initial plans were to raise an Islamic army (Hizb Allah) headquartered at Medina, with an Indian contingent at Kabul. Maulana Hasan was to be the General-in-chief of this army. Some of Ubaidullah's students went to Kabul to explore things before Ubaidullah arrived there. While at Kabul, Ubaidullah came to the conclusion that focusing on the Indian Freedom Movement would best serve the pan-Islamic cause. Ubaidullah had proposed to the Afghan Emir that he declare war against British India. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad is known to have been involved in the movement prior to his arrest in 1916. Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan (principal of the Darul Uloom Deoband) had proceeded to Kabul in October 1915 with plans to initiate a Muslim insurrection in the tribal belt of British India. For this purpose, Ubaid Allah was to propose that the Amir of Afghanistan declares war against Britain while Mahmud al Hasan sought German and Turkish help. Hasan proceeded to Hijaz. Ubaidullah, in the meantime, was able to establish friendly relations with Emir Habibullah of Afghanistan. At Kabul, Ubaidullah along with some of his students, were to make their way to Turkey to join the Caliph's \\"Jihad\\" against Britain. But it was eventually decided that the pan-Islamic cause was to be best served by focusing on the Indian Freedom Movement. In late 1915, Sindhi was met in Kabul by the 'Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition' sent by the Indian Independence Committee in Berlin and the German war ministry. Nominally led by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, it had among its members the Islamic scholar Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah, and the German officers Werner Otto von Hentig and Oskar Niedermayer, as well as a number of other notable individuals. The expedition tried to rally Emir Habibullah's support, and through him, begin a campaign into British India. It was hoped that it would initiate a rebellion in British India. On 1 December 1915, the Provisional Government of India was founded at Emir Habibullah's 'Bagh-e-Babur palace' in the presence of the Indian, German, and Turkish members of the expedition. It was declared a 'revolutionary government-in-exile' which was to take charge of independent India when British authority is overthrown. Mahendra Pratap was proclaimed its President, Barkatullah the Prime minister, Ubaidullah Sindhi the Minister for India, another Deobandi leader Moulavi Bashir its War Minister, and Champakaran Pillai was to be the Foreign Minister. The Provisional Government of India obtained support from Galib Pasha and proclaimed Jihad against Britain. Recognition was sought from the Russian Empire, Republican China and Japan. This provisional government would later attempt to obtain support from Soviet leadership. After the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government. In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilise against British India. However, these plans faltered, Emir Habibullah remained steadfastly neutral while he awaited a concrete indication where the war was headed, even as his advisory council and family members indicated their support against Britain. The Germans withdrew their support in 1917, but the 'Provisional Government of India' stayed behind at Kabul. In 1919, this government was ultimately dissolved under British diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan. Ubaidullah had stayed in Kabul for nearly seven years. He even encouraged the young King Amanullah Khan, who took power in Afghanistan after Habibullah's assassination, in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The conclusion of the war, ultimately, forced Ubaidullah Sindhi to leave Afghanistan as King Amanullah came under pressure from Britain.Of socialism and Islam Dawn (newspaper), Published 8 July 2011, Retrieved 6 March 2019 Later works Ubaidullah then proceeded from Afghanistan to Russia, where he spent seven months at the invitation of the Soviet leadership, and was officially treated as a guest of the state. During this period, he studied the ideology of socialism. According to an article in a major newspaper of Pakistan, titled 'Of socialism and Islam', \\"Islam showed not only deep sympathy for the poor and downtrodden but also condemned strongly the concentration of wealth in a number of Makkan surahs. Makkah, as an important centre of international trade, was home to the very rich (tribal chiefs) and the extremely poor.\\" In Russia, however, he was unable to meet Lenin who was severely ill at the time. Some people, at that time, thought that Sindhi was impressed by Communist ideals during his stay in Russia, however that is not true at all. In 1923, Ubaidullah left Russia for Turkey where he initiated the third phase of the 'Shah Waliullah Movement' in 1924. He issued the 'Charter for the Independence of India' from Istanbul. Ubaidullah then left for Mecca, Arabia in 1927 and remained there until 1929. During this period, he brought the message of the rights of Muslims and other important religious issues to the people of Arabia. During his stay in Russia, he was not impressed by the Communist ideas but rather, after the Soviet revolution, he presented his belief to the Soviet government that: \\"Communism is not a natural law system but rather is a reaction to oppression, the natural law is offered by Islam\\". He attempted to convince them in a very systematic and logical manner. But he could not give an answer at that time, when he was asked to provide an example of a state which was being run according to the laws of Islam.

Other religious holy books like the Bible, the Gita and the Torah are also followed by many people around the world. He realized non-religious people (atheists) also existed in this world. After all he had spent some time among the communists in Russia. The individuals, who inaccurately interpreted the Bible and the Torah, were declared nonbelievers by Islam. In the same way, the person who incorrectly explains the Quran, can be declared an atheist. In Islam, the emphasis is clearly on God being eternal and everything in the universe belonging to Him alone. God alone is the Creator and Protector. It is evident from Ubaidullah Sindhi's travels around the world that he had an international and world outlook. It is also evident from his lifetime behavior and struggles that he wanted India not to be ruled by the British. He wanted India to be ruled by the Indians.  Death  In 1936, the Indian National Congress requested his return to India, and the British Raj subsequently gave its permission. He landed at the port of Karachi from Saudi Arabia in 1938. He then went to Delhi, where he began a programme teaching Shah Waliullah‚Äôs Hujjatullahil Baalighah book to Maulana Saeed Ahmad Akbarabadi, who would then write an exegesis in his own words. Opposed to the partition of India, Ubaidullah led a conference supporting a united India in June 1941 at Kumbakonam. Ubaidullah left for Rahim Yar Khan to visit his daughter in 1944. At the village 'Deen Pur' near Khanpur town in Rahim Yar Khan District, he was taken seriously ill and died on 21 August 1944. He was buried in the graveyard adjacent to the grave of his mentors.

As its direction is random, there is no net change in momentum over many atoms. } Doppler cooling is a mechanism that can be used to trap and slow the motion of atoms to cool a substance. The term is sometimes used synonymously with laser cooling, though laser cooling includes other techniques. History Doppler cooling was simultaneously proposed by two groups in 1975, the first being David J. Wineland and Hans Georg Dehmelt and the second being Theodor W. H√§nsch and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. It was first demonstrated by Wineland, Drullinger, and Walls in 1978 and shortly afterwards by Neuhauser, Hohenstatt, Toschek and Dehmelt. One conceptually simple form of Doppler cooling is referred to as optical molasses, since the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses. Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips were awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in laser cooling and atom trapping. Brief explanation Doppler cooling involves light with frequency tuned slightly below an electronic transition in an atom. Because the light is detuned to the \\"red\\" (i.e. at lower frequency) of the transition, the atoms will absorb more photons if they move towards the light source, due to the Doppler effect. Consider the simplest case of 1D motion on the x axis. Let the photon be traveling in the +x direction and the atom in the -x direction. In each absorption event, the atom loses a momentum equal to the momentum of the photon. The atom, which is now in the excited state, emits a photon spontaneously but randomly along +x or -x. Momentum is returned to the atom. If the photon was emitted along +x then there is no net change, however if the photon was emitted along -x then the atom is moving more slowly in either -x or +x. The net result of the absorption and emission process is a reduced speed of the atom, on the condition that its initial speed is larger than the recoil velocity from scattering a single photon. If the absorption and emission are repeated many times, the mean velocity, and therefore the kinetic energy of the atom will be reduced. Since the temperature of an ensemble of atoms is a measure of the random internal kinetic energy, this is equivalent to cooling the atoms. The Doppler cooling limit is the minimum temperature achievable with Doppler cooling.  Detailed explanation  The vast majority of photons that come anywhere near a particular atom are almostThere are processes, such as Rayleigh and Raman scattering, by which atoms and molecules will scatter non-resonant photons; see, e.g., This type of scattering, however, is normally very weak in comparison to resonant absorption and emission (i.e., fluorescence). completely unaffected by that atom. The atom is almost completely transparent to most frequencies (colors) of photons. A few photons happen to \\"resonate\\" with the atom, in a few very narrow bands of frequencies (a single color rather than a mixture like white light). When one of those photons comes close to the atom, the atom typically absorbs that photon (absorption spectrum) for a brief period of time, then emits an identical photon (emission spectrum) in some random, unpredictable direction. (Other sorts of interactions between atoms and photons exist, but are not relevant to this article.) The popular idea that lasers increase the thermal energy of matter is not the case when examining individual atoms. If a given atom is practically motionless (a \\"cold\\" atom), and the frequency of a laser focused upon it can be controlled, most frequencies do not affect the atom--it is invisible at those frequencies. There are only a few points of electromagnetic frequency that have any effect on that atom. At those frequencies, the atom can absorb a photon from the laser, while transitioning to an excited electronic state, and pick up the momentum of that photon. Since the atom now has the photon's momentum, the atom must begin to drift in the direction the photon was traveling. A short time later, the atom will spontaneously emit a photon in a random direction, as it relaxes to a lower electronic state. If that photon is emitted in the direction of the original photon, the atom will give up its momentum to the photon and will become motionless again. If the photon is emitted in the opposite direction, the atom will have to provide momentum in that opposite direction, which means the atom will pick up even more momentum in the direction of the original photon (to conserve momentum), with double its original velocity. But usually the photon speeds away in some other direction, giving the atom at least some sideways thrust. Another way of changing frequencies is to change the positioning of the laser. For example, using a monochromatic (single-color) laser that has a frequency that is a little below one of the \\"resonant\\" frequencies of this atom (at which frequency the laser will not directly affect the atom's state). If the laser were to be positioned so that it was moving towards the observed atoms, then the Doppler effect would raise its frequency. At one specific velocity, the frequency would be precisely correct for said atoms to begin absorbing photons. Something very similar happens in a laser cooling apparatus, except such devices start with a warm cloud of atoms moving in numerous directions at variable velocity. Starting with a laser frequency well below the resonant frequency, photons from any one laser pass right through the majority of atoms. However, atoms moving rapidly towards a particular laser catch the photons for that laser, slowing those atoms down until they become transparent again. (Atoms rapidly moving away from that laser are transparent to that laser's photons--but they are rapidly moving towards the laser directly opposite it). This utilization of a specific velocity to induce absorption is also seen in M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. On a graph of atom velocities (atoms moving rapidly to the right correspond with stationary dots far to the right, atoms moving rapidly to the left correspond with stationary dots far to the left), there is a narrow band on the left edge corresponding to the speed those atoms start absorbing photons from the left laser. Atoms in that band are the only ones that interact with the left laser. When a photon from the left laser slams into one of those atoms, it suddenly slows down an amount corresponding to the momentum of that photon (the dot would be redrawn some fixed \\"quantum\\" distance further to the right). If the atom releases the photon directly to the right, then the dot is redrawn that same distance to the left, putting it back in the narrow band of interaction. But usually the atom releases the photon in some other random direction, and the dot is redrawn that quantum distance in the opposite direction. Such an apparatus would be constructed with many lasers, corresponding to many boundary lines that completely surround that cloud of dots. As the laser frequency is increased, the boundary contracts, pushing all the dots on that graph towards zero velocity, the given definition of \\"cold\\".  Limits =Minimum temperature The Doppler temperature is the minimum temperature achievable with Doppler cooling. When a photon is absorbed by an atom counter-propagating to the light source, its velocity is decreased by momentum conservation. When the absorbed photon is spontaneously emitted by the excited atom, the atom receives a momentum kick in a random direction. The spontaneous emissions are isotropic and therefore these momentum kicks average to zero for the mean velocity. On the other hand, the mean squared velocity, \\\\langle v^2\\\\rangle, is not zero in the random process, and thus heat is supplied to the atom. At equilibrium, the heating and cooling rates are equal, which sets a limit on the amount by which the atom can be cooled. As the transitions used for Doppler cooling have broad natural linewidths \\\\gamma (measured in radians per second), this sets the lower limit to the temperature of the atoms after cooling to be T_{\\\\mathrm{Doppler}} = \\\\hbar \\\\gamma /(2k_{B}) where k_{B} is the Boltzmann's constant and \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant. This is usually much higher than the recoil temperature, which is the temperature associated with the momentum gained from the spontaneous emission of a photon. The Doppler limit has been verified with a gas of metastable helium. =Sub-Doppler cooling= Temperatures well below the Doppler limit have been achieved with various laser cooling methods, including Sisyphus cooling and evaporative cooling. The theory of Doppler cooling assumes an atom with a simple two level structure, whereas most atomic species which are laser cooled have complicated hyperfine structure. Mechanisms such as Sisyphus cooling due to multiple ground states lead to temperatures lower than the Doppler limit. Maximum concentration The concentration must be minimal to prevent the absorption of the photons into the gas in the form of heat. This absorption happens when two atoms collide with each other while one of them has an excited electron. There is then a possibility of the excited electron dropping back to the ground state with its extra energy liberated in additional kinetic energy to the colliding atoms--which heats the atoms. This works against the cooling process and therefore limits the maximum concentration of gas that can be cooled using this method. Atomic structure Only certain atoms and ions have optical transitions amenable to laser cooling, since it is extremely difficult to generate the amounts of laser power needed at wavelengths much shorter than 300 nm. Furthermore, the more hyperfine structure an atom has, the more ways there are for it to emit a photon from the upper state and not return to its original state, putting it in a dark state and removing it from the cooling process. It is possible to use other lasers to optically pump those atoms back into the excited state and try again, but the more complex the hyperfine structure is, the more (narrow- band, frequency locked) lasers are required. Since frequency-locked lasers are both complex and expensive, atoms which need more than one extra repump laser are rarely cooled; the common rubidium magneto-optical trap, for example, requires one repump laser. This is also the reason why molecules are in general difficult to laser cool: in addition to hyperfine structure, molecules also have rovibronic couplings and so can also decay into excited rotational or vibrational states. However, laser cooling of molecules has been demonstrated first to work for SrF molecules, and subsequently other diatomics such as CaF and YO as well.  Configurations  Counter-propagating sets of laser beams in all three Cartesian dimensions may be used to cool the three motional degrees of freedom of the atom. Common laser-cooling configurations include optical molasses, the magneto-optical trap, and the Zeeman slower. Atomic ions, trapped in an ion trap, can be cooled with a single laser beam as long as that beam has a component along all three motional degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to the six beams required to trap neutral atoms. The original laser cooling experiments were performed on ions in ion traps. (In theory, neutral atoms could be cooled with a single beam if they could be trapped in a deep trap, but in practice neutral traps are much shallower than ion traps and a single recoil event can be enough to kick a neutral atom out of the trap.)  Applications  One use for Doppler cooling is the optical molasses technique. This process itself forms a part of the magneto-optical trap but it can be used independently. Doppler cooling is also used in spectroscopy and metrology, where cooling allows narrower spectroscopic features. For example, all of the best atomic clock technologies involve Doppler cooling at some point.

Coma is considered the band's strongest effort of the period, and remains one of the most influential albums of the Soviet rock music. Grigoryan succeeded in drawing new musicians to the band although since 1980's the group sometimes plays with a 'reduced' (acoustic) lineup, including Armen Grigoryan, the violinist and the guitarist. The band has changed with times, \\"emerging in the words of Rodion Schedrin, as the original \\"Waltz-Rock\\" band, much different from its underground beginnings, but always true to its passion to create original music.

It is typically found on branches and leaning stems. It is an example of mechanical acclimation in trees. Progressive bending and cracking would occur in parts of the tree undergoing predominantly tensile or compressive stresses were it not for the localised production of reaction wood, which differs from ordinary wood in its mechanical properties. Reaction wood may be laid down in wider than normal annual increments, so that the cross section is often asymmetric or elliptical. The structure of cells and vessels is also different, resulting in additional strength. The effect of reaction wood is to help maintain the angle of the bent or leaning part by resisting further downward bending or failure. There are two different types of reaction wood, which represent two different approaches to the same problem by woody plants: * In most angiosperms reaction wood is called tension wood. Tension wood forms on the side of the part of the plant that is under tension, pulling it towards the affecting force (upwards, in the case of a branch). It has a higher proportion of cellulose than normal wood. Tension wood may have as high as 60% cellulose. * In gymnosperms and amborella it is called compression wood. Compression wood forms on the side of the plant that is under compression, thereby lengthening/straightening the bend. Compression wood has a higher proportion of lignin than normal wood. Compression wood has only about 30% cellulose compared to 42% in normal softwood. Its lignin content can be as high as 40%. The controlling factor behind reaction wood appears to be the hormone auxin, although the exact mechanism is not clear. In a leaning stem, the normal flow of auxin down the tree is displaced by gravity and it accumulates on the lower side. The formation of reaction wood may act in conjunction with other corrective or adaptive mechanisms in woody plants, such as thigomorphism (adaptive response to flexure) and gravitropism (the correction of, rather than the support of, lean) and the auxin-controlled balance of growth rates and growth direction between stems and branches. The term ‚Äòadaptive growth' therefore includes, but is not synonymous with, the formation of reaction wood. As a rule, reaction wood is undesirable in any structural application, primarily as its mechanical properties are different from normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. Reaction wood can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining. This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place. For instance, ripping a piece of reaction wood on a table saw without a splitter or riving knife installed can lead to kick back of the stock. Reaction wood also responds to moisture differently from normal wood. Traditionally, compression wood does have niche applications. For instance, hunters in north Eurasia and the American Arctic were known to harvest compression wood for bow staves, because the increased density and compression strength of this wood enabled them to make functional weapons out of tree species that would otherwise be unsuitable for this purpose, due to their low strength and low density.

Early life Sima Daozi was born in 364, two years after his older brother Sima Yao was born to their father, Sima Yu, Prince of Kuaiji, and mother Consort Li. In 371, after the paramount general Huan Wen deposed Emperor Fei to showcase his power, he made Sima Yu emperor (as Emperor Jianwen). In 372, when Emperor Jianwen grew ill, he created Sima Yao crown prince and Sima Daozi the Prince of Langye. He died soon thereafter, and Sima Yao assumed the throne as Emperor Xiaowu. During Emperor Xiaowu's reign As the emperor's only surviving brother, Sima Daozi was in an honored position. In 380, when he was just 16, he was offered the position of prime minister, but he declined. In 383, he finally accepted the title while the empire was preparing for a showdown with the powerful rival Former Qin, and, after Jin forces repelled Former Qin forces at the Battle of Fei River, thus guaranteeing the dynasty's continued survival, he soon came into a power conflict with Xie An, who had served as Emperor Xiaowu's regent ever since Emperor Xiaowu's ascension; this conflict was aggravated by Xie An's son-in- law Wang Guobao (ÁéãÂúãÂØ∂), whose cousin was Sima Daozi's wife and whom Xie disfavored, who therefore retaliated by slandering Xie before Emperor Xiaowu and Sima Daozi. Emperor Xiaowu therefore began to listen to Xie less, and in 385, Xie volunteered to lead an army and leave the capital to avoid further conflict with Sima Daozi. When Xie died later that year, Sima Daozi became the head of the government under Emperor Xiaowu, who entrusted his brother with most important affairs of state. Both Emperor Xiaowu and Sima Daozi were described to be spending much of their times with drinking and feasting, rather than with important affairs of state. A number of politicians who wanted power gathered around Sima Daozi and flattered him, causing him to be less and less deferential to the emperor. He was also known for being obsessed with gathering wealth and for extravagance in living‚Äîincluding constructing an artificial hill in the back of his mansion, an excessively expensive and difficult task. Emperor Xiaowu eventually became angry about the situation, and he commissioned the well-known officials Wang Gong (ÁéãÊÅ≠) and Yin Zhongkan (ÊÆ∑‰ª≤Â†™) to be provincial governors to counteract Sima Daozi's authority. The emperor and the prince at times suspected of each other, requiring intervention of their mother Empress Dowager Li. However, eventually they reconciled. It was around this time that Sima Daozi would, fatefully, inadvertently offend Huan Wen's son Huan Xuan the Duke of Nan Commandery‚Äîas at one feast where Sima Daozi invited Huan Xuan as a guest, after Sima Daozi became drunk, he made the statement, \\"Was it not true that when Huan Wen became old, he planned treason?\\" Huan Xuan was so struck by the statement that he fell prostrate on the ground, fearing that Sima Daozi would kill him, and from this point he bore a grudge against the prince. In 392, Sima Daozi was created the Prince of Kuaiji, to permit the greater title of Prince of Langye be given to Emperor Xiaowu's second son Sima Dewen (the younger brother to the developmentally disabled Crown Prince Sima Dezong). In 396, Emperor Xiaowu, after offending his favorite concubine Honoured Lady Zhang, was suffocated by her in his sleep. However, with the crown prince being developmentally disabled and with Sima Daozi being foolish and unthinking, no one investigated his death. Crown Prince Dezong took the throne as Emperor An, and Sima Daozi, as uncle, served as regent. As Emperor An's regent Sima Daozi, as regent, greatly trusted Wang Guobao and his cousin Wang Xu (ÁéãÁ∑í) because of their flattery, and his regency quickly developed a reputation for being corrupt and incompetent. Wang Gong, whom Emperor Xiaowu entrusted with the armies of the northeastern part of the empire, considered starting a rebellion to overthrow Wang Guobao and Wang Xu. In 397, Wang Guobao and Wang Xu suggested to Sima Daozi that the armies that Wang Gong and Yin Zhongkan were in charge of be reduced; Wang Gong and Yin, who was in command of the western provinces, in response, mobilized their forces and declared that Wang Guobao and Wang Xu should be executed. Sima Daozi, in fear, forced Wang Guobao to commit suicide and executed Wang Xu. Wang Gong and Yin then retreated. From this point on, Sima Daozi trusted no one but his teenage heir apparent, Sima Yuanxian, and entrusted the capital guards to Sima Yuanxian. He also gave military commands to his distant relatives Sima Shangzhi (Âè∏È¶¨Â∞ö‰πã) the Prince of Qiao and Sima Shangzhi's brother Sima Xiuzhi, as well as Wang Yu (ÁéãÊÑâ), in 398. The giving of a military command to Wang Yu oddly drew a reaction from Wang Gong and Yin‚Äîas Wang Yu's command included four commanderies originally under the command of Yu Kai (Â∫æÊ•∑), who became angry and managed to persuade Wang Gong and Yin that Sima Daozi's intention was to act against them as well. They therefore rose again, but Sima Daozi was able to persuade Wang Gong's general Liu Laozhi (ÂäâÁâ¢‰πã), who was in command of the elite Beifu Forces (ÂåóÂ∫úÂÖµ), to suddenly turn against Wang Gong, capturing and executing him. Yin, hearing of Wang Gong's death, was in fear but considered proceeding anyway‚Äîand Sima Daozi, under suggestion by Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Xiu (Ê°ìËÑ©), managed to cause dissension between Yin and his generals Huan Xuan and Yang Quanqi (Ê•ä‰Ω∫Êúü) by offering Huan and Yang key posts; although Huan and Yang nominally remained Yin's allies, Yin was forced to withdraw his troops, and from that point on no longer posed a major threat, as his domain had now been divided into three, with Huan and Yang each given a third. In late 398, the magician Sun Tai (Â≠´Ê≥∞), a friend of Sima Yuanxian's, who had gathered great following due to his magic, was exposed as planning a plot to take over the central government, and Sima Daozi ordered Sima Yuanxian to trap Sun Tai and execute him. Sun Tai's nephew Sun En fled to Zhoushan Island and planned revenge. In summer 399, Sima Yuanxian, wanting even greater power, took an opportunity when his father was very drunk to have Emperor An issue an edict transferring Sima Daozi's authorities to Sima Yuanxian. When Sima Daozi awoke from his stupor, he was enraged, but after that point his power became extremely limited, even though he nominally remained regent. Later in 399, Sun En launched his rebellion and captured most of the eastern empire for a while, until Liu Laozhi led his Beifu Forces and defeated Sun, forcing him to flee back to Zhoushan. Still, the only region remaining under central government control was now laid waste. In 401, Sima Yuanxian, apprehensive of Huan Xuan (who had by then defeated and executed Yin and Yang, taking over the entire western empire), declared Huan a renegade and launched a campaign against him. However, he relied on Liu's troops, and Liu, not trusting his good intentions, again turned sides and joined Huan, and in 402 the capital Jiankang fell to Huan's forces. Sima Yuanxian was captured and executed, while Sima Daozi was exiled to Ancheng (ÂÆâÊàê, in modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). Around the new year 403, an official sent by Huan Xuan, pursuant to Huan Xuan's instructions, poisoned Sima Daozi to death.

A native of Kingsport, Tennessee, he is best known for his tenure as head coach of the University of Southwestern Louisiana‚Äînow as the University of Louisiana at Lafayette‚Äîfrom 1957 to 1973. Shipley was hired at what was then Southwestern Louisiana Institute in 1958. In 1966, Shipley recruited three black players, thus becoming the first collegiate coach in the Deep South to have black players on his team. In a region where Jim Crow was a way of life well into the 1960s‚Äîlong after most Jim Crow laws were formally repealed‚ÄîShipley faced intense criticism and opposition for trying to integrate his teams. However, he said years later that he was tired of telling good players that he couldn't sign them because of an unwritten Gulf States Conference rule forbidding black players on conference teams. When state officials barred state money from being used to fund the scholarships for the players, Shipley had area black leaders chip in enough money to pay the players' way.Bradley, John Ed. An Accidental Hero: Beryl Shipley, 1926-2011. Sports Illustrated, May 2, 2011. However, this violated an NCAA rule against players receiving financial assistance from outside their family. In 1968, partly due to this, the Ragin' Cajuns were slapped with two years' probation and barred from postseason play during that time.1968 USL infractions report Shipley didn't take long to recover from the probation, however. In 1972, the Ragin' Cajuns jumped to Division I, finished in the top 10 of most major polls and advanced all the way to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, becoming the first school to make the tournament in its first year of eligibility. They repeated this feat in 1973. However, a month after the tournament, Shipley abruptly resigned. That August, the NCAA found Southwestern Louisiana guilty of more than 125 violations. Most of them involved small cash payments to players, letting players borrow coaches' and boosters' cars, letting players use university credit cards to buy gas and buying clothes and other objects for players. However, the most severe violations involved massive academic fraud. The NCAA found that one of Shipley's assistants had altered a recruit's high school transcript and forged the principal's signature, and others close to the program had arranged for surrogates to take college entrance exams for prospective recruits. The NCAA responded by scrubbing the Ragin' Cajuns' 1972 and 1973 appearances from the books and shutting the program down for two years‚Äîonly the second time that the NCAA had ever punished a school with the so-called \\"death penalty,\\" and to date the only multi-season cancellation ever handed down to a Division I member in any sport.1973 USL infraction report Midway through the 1974-75 season, he became coach of the ABA's San Diego Conquistadors. After this, he retired from coaching and became involved in the oil distribution business. In his later years, Shipley admitted to violating NCAA rules, but claimed he did so for \\"humanitarian reasons.\\" In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 2011, he mentioned that one of his players came to school with only one set of clothes and no sheets for his bed. The player was too poor to buy them, so Shipley felt compelled to buy some for him out of his own pocket. However, he denied knowing about the academic fraud, and fought for years to clear his name to no avail. He was largely ostracized by Southwestern Louisiana/Louisiana-Lafayette for many years; school officials took the line that as the head coach, he should have had more control over the program. Shipley suffered two heart attacks in the 1980s and later had surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 which eventually spread into his brain. Louisiana-Lafayette held a reunion of the 1972 and 1973 teams in January 2011, but by then Shipley was too sick to attend. Shipley died on April 15, 2011 at the age of 84.

Castillo is noted for being one of only two players to earn a senior cap for both sides of the United States- Mexico rivalry.  Youth  Castillo grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and played for Mayfield High School under coach Arturo Garibay. In 2002, as a sophomore, he was named NSCAA/Adidas High School State Player of the Year. He was one of the top players in New Mexico as he helped lead Mayfield High School to two state championships games . He first gained the notice of professional teams in 2005 playing for his local club in the Dallas Cup, one of the world's top youth tournaments. His team made it to the Dallas Cup final for the Super Group but lost to Atletico Paranaense of Brazil, 1‚Äì0. Castillo was also a player for the Olympic Development Program regional pool for many years. His younger brother, Noel Castillo, is on the reserve team for Indios de Ciudad Juarez of Mexico.  Professional career  Castillo began his professional career with Santos Laguna of the Primera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico. After becoming a first team regular at Santos, and winning the championship in 2008, Castillo transferred mid-season to Club Am√©rica in January 2009. During the off-season, Castillo was on loan to Tigres UANL and played for them during the 2009/10 season. He scored his first goal for Tigres against his former side, Santos Laguna, on August 30, 2009. On November 23, 2011, Castillo agreed to being loaned to Club Tijuana; on June 7, 2012 he joined Tijuana, permanently. Castillo moved to Atlas during the 2014 off-season. On January 9, 2018, Castillo moved to the Colorado Rapids on a one year loan with an option to buy. Castillo made his debut on March 10, 2018 in a 1‚Äì2 loss to the New England Revolution. On June 1, 2018, he scored his debut goal for the club in a 1‚Äì2 loss to the Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Ahead of the 2019 season, Castillo was traded to the New England Revolution in exchange for Kelyn Rowe. He made his debut on March 2, 2019 in a 1‚Äì1 draw with FC Dallas. On January 17, 2020, Castillo made the move to Atlanta United after his option was declined by New England at the end of the 2019 season. International career=Mexico In early August 2007, Mexico coach Hugo S√°nchez called-up Castillo for the three upcoming friendlies with Colombia, Panama, and Brazil. On August 22, 2007 Castillo made his debut with the Mexico national team and entered at the 53rd minute in the friendly against Colombia. In March 2008 he was also a member of the Mexico U-23 squad which participated in the 2008 CONCACAF Men Pre-Olympic Tournament in order to qualify for 2008 Summer Olympics. He was called up by Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson to be on the 23-man roster for the Mexico national team, but he was benched during the game against Honduras on August 20, 2008. On November 12, 2008, Castillo appeared in a friendly match against Ecuador in Phoenix, Arizona. He replaced Francisco Fonseca as Mexico beat Ecuador 2‚Äì1. He was called up for the national team again on January 28, 2009, in a friendly against Sweden. Castillo was called up to the national side for World Cup qualifiers against Costa Rica in Mexico City and Honduras in San Pedro Sula on March 28 and April 1, 2009 but was unable to travel to either match because he had \\"lost\\" his Mexico passport. United States Under a recent change in FIFA regulations, Castillo became eligible to play for the United States. The new rule allowed players of any age to make a one-time national affiliation change if they held citizenship in their new country and yet have not played in a competitive senior level match for their previous nationality. The previous rule only allowed a change if the player was under 21. On June 29, 2009, he was asked about possibly playing for the United States, saying, \\"I would play for the United States. I'd want to talk to them first, but I want to play for the U.S. I think it would be a very good opportunity for me, for my career. If they call me I would play for them.\\" Castillo also said, \\"I have made my decision. I want to represent the country where I was born, the place where I live.\\"Castillo: I would play for the United States On September 2009, Castillo was cleared by FIFA to join the United States national team. On October 31, 2009 Castillo reveals to Mexican media after a Tigres UANL match vs Estudiantes Tecos that he had received a call earlier that day and stated \\"I was called up for training with the U.S. team and I am expected to appear to play against Denmark ....I'm hoping to give a good impression\\". Castillo made his U.S. debut as a second-half sub in a friendly against Denmark in which they lost on November 18, 2009. He is now the second player to earn caps for both Mexico and the United States, joining Martin Vasquez, who played non-FIFA-recognized matches with Mexico in 1992 and 1993 before receiving official call-ups to the U.S. starting in 1996. Castillo's decision to join the USMNT triggered a strongly negative response from Mexican fans. \\"When I changed to the U.S. national team, it was a hard time for me because people called me a traitor and stuff like that,\\" Castillo remarked. He further elaborated on his decision, ultimately stating, \\"It's a big priority,\\" Castillo said of playing for the United States. \\"I was born in the U.S.[....] I've played a lot in Mexico because Mexico has been treating me good, I changed to the U.S. national team and I think I made a good choice.\\" Castillo has since been recalled to the USMNT under new head coach Jurgen Klinsmann, and started against Mexico on August 10, 2011.

It is, along with the Nebraska Army National Guard, an element of the Nebraska National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the Nebraska Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Nebraska though the office of the Nebraska Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Nebraska Air National Guard is headquartered at Lincoln Air National Guard Base, and its commander is Brigadier General Wendy Johnson. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Nebraska Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Nebraska ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Nebraska Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Nebraska ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Nebraska Air National Guard consists of the following major units: * 155th Air Refueling Wing : Established 26 July 1946 (as: 173d Fighter Squadron); operates: KC-135R Stratotanker : Stationed at: Lincoln Air National Guard Base, Lincoln : Gained by: Air Mobility Command : The 155th operates the KC-135R Stratotanker, which is responsible for conducting air refueling missions around the world.155th Air Refueling Wing website * 170th Group : Established 7 July 2007 : Stationed at: Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha : Gained by: Air Combat Command : The 170th Group administratively organizes Nebraska ANG members assigned to Offutt under the Offutt AFB Future Total Force Initiative. History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 F-80A Shooting Stars of the 173d Fighter Squadron in formation, 1948 The Nebraska Air National Guard origins date to the formation of the 173d Fighter Squadron at Lincoln Army Airfield, Lincoln, receiving federal recognition on 26 July 1946. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Nebraska Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 1 July 1960 the 173d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 155th Fighter-Interceptor Group was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. Today, the 155th Air Refueling Wing (155 ARW) provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and allied nation aircraft. In 2007, the 170th Group at Offutt AFB was formed. The 170th evolved from Detachment 1, Headquarters Nebraska ANG established in June 2002. Under this initiative, highly qualified ANG instructor aircrew integrate into the 338th Combat Training Squadron to provide initial qualification, re- qualification and upgrade training to active duty and ANG aircrew members. These functional areas include requirements, weapons and tactics, intelligence, base operations, weather, and aviation resource management. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Washington has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Nebraska ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed.

The genus contains the type and only species Scleromochlus taylori, named by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1907. Description Scleromochlus taylori was about long, with long hind legs; it may have been capable of four-legged and two-legged locomotion. Studies about its gait suggest that it engaged in kangaroo- or springhare-like plantigrade hopping; however, a 2020 reassessment of Scleromochlus by Bennett suggested that it was a \\"sprawling quadrupedal hopper analogous to frogs.\\" If Scleromochlus is indeed related to pterosaurs, this may offer insight as to how the latter evolved, since early pterosaurs also show adaptations for saltatorial locomotion. Discovery Its fossils have been found in the Carnian Lossiemouth Sandstone of Scotland. The holotype is BMNH R3556, a partial skeleton preserved as an impression in sandstone; part of the skull and tail are missing. Classification Skeletal diagram A lightly built cursorial animal, its phylogenetic position has been debated; as different analyses have found it to be either the basal-most ornithodiran, the sister- taxon to Pterosauria, or a basal member of Avemetatarsalia that lies outside of Ornithodira. In the phylogenetic analyses conducted by Nesbitt et al. (2017) Scleromochlus was recovered either as a basal member of Dinosauromorpha or as a non-aphanosaurian, non-pterosaur basal avemetatarsalian. However, the authors stressed that scoring Scleromochlus was challenging given the small size and poor preservation of the fossils, and stated that it could not be scored for many of the important characters that optimize near the base of Avemetatarsalia. In 2020, Bennett interpreted Scleromochlus as possessing certain characteristics, including osteoderms and a crurotarsal morphology of the ankle, which suggested that Scleromochlus was not closely related to ornithodirans. He instead argued for a position of Scleromochlus among the Doswelliidae or elsewhere among basal members of the Archosauriformes.

It is recognized by the government and managed by the Society of Jesus. History The school was founded in 1856. Fr. Charmilliot, an Austrian Jesuit, first stepped into the compound of St Paul's as the chaplain of Our Lady of Mount Carmel chapel, that existed on these premises. From that day the Jesuits never left the premises even though their nationality might have changed. First the school had Austrian and German Jesuit fathers. They were replaced by the Portuguese Jesuits. Now Indian Jesuits of the Goa Province run the school. Motto The motto of the school is Induamar Arma Lucis ‚Äì \\"Let us put on the armour of light\\", which means \\"Be a light to others, bring light to the world around you by your words, and above all by your actions.\\" Growth Beginning with four classrooms and 6070 students, the school has grown to over 2000 students. Though it was started primarily for the Catholics, it has opened its doors to students of all religions, castes, ethnic backgrounds, and colour. Scholarships and help are provided to those who can't afford the tuition. Academic standing The school received recognition on 30 November 1868 from Bombay University as a part of Bombay Presidency. The first batch appeared in the Matriculation Examination in 1917. It was given government grant-in-aid already from 1917. The Inspector Mr. H. Davies wrote in 1936: > The upper classes are extremely well graded and taught, the School‚Äôs record > in the Matriculation Examination being one which over a long period has > entitled it to respect‚Ä¶.The percentage of passes (24 sent up and 20 passed) > is therefore 83% as against the University general average of 35% and the > school stands first among the English Teaching Schools of the Presidency. > The best English education is given here and conversation in English is > compulsory unlike some of the other schools in the city.

Reorienting goals In 1974 there was rethinking about education, especially in Jesuit institutions. The boarding had for some years a supplementary section called the orphanage, which catered to destitute children whose parents had died in plagues or other epidemics. In 1974 there was a rethinking of the hostel project when the old hostel was closed. In its place the hostel reopened its doors to the boys from the villages around. Their education is highly subsidized. Jubilees * In 1981 the school celebrated its 125th jubilee. * In 2006 the school celebrated its 150th jubilee. 150th year celebrations The 150th year celebrations of the school were held on 10 February 2006 along with the Passing Out parade of the SSLC jubilee batch. Throughout the year the school conducted extracurricular activities and celebrated its jubilee. There was a cultural fest in October 2006 known as the Anand Utsav. The school held the valedictory ceremony of its 150th year from 7 to 10 December. On 7 December the school held celebrations for the students and parents. In the morning there were programmes and a magic show by Junior Marcos. On 8 December there was a grand celebration for the ex-students and teachers. Prayer services and dances were held on the occasion. On 9 December the main valedictory event was held. On this occasion a skit depicted the events from the birth of man to St Paul's in its present state. On 19 December Shaan sang. St. Paul's high School hosts an inter- College Cultural fest 'Kronos' which hosts Competitions for most schools in Belagavi. On 17 December 2016, nearly 3638 ex students had a reunion and were successful to make a Guinness world record for the highest attendees for a school reunion Culture=House system Students are divided into four Houses namely Gold, Green, Blue, and Red. Each house colour is depicted on the student's uniform, either as a badge or as a coloured shirt. They are led by four house commanders with their four secretaries. Two posts rank above the commanders - School Pupil Leader (SPL) and Assistant School Pupil Leader (ASPL). Competition is fostered among the houses in sports and studies alike. Passing Out parade The school conducts a Passing Out parade for the SSLC batch in February each year. The junior students produce dance performances for entertainment. The high school students of Std VIII and IX salute the Xth Std students. The SSLC students march for the last time with lamps, to the sound of the song \\"Now is the Hour\\". After the Passing Out parade, the students pose for photos with their friends and teachers. Till recently the passing out batch wore white shirts and black pants with a tie. Now they wear their normal school dress. School anthem The school anthem is Cheer Boys Cheer Cheer boys, cheer, cheer the Blue and Gold Hail to thee O St. Paul !

In course of this process students learn management skills in aspects of time, money, marketing, public relations etc It was started by the SPHS Cabinet batch of 2012 and since then it is being carried forward by upcoming batches. KRONOS is also a great platform for students of other schools to showcase their talents.  The Paulite  The school magazine, The Paulite as it came to be known later on, or the St Paul's Annual as it was known initially, was the brainchild of Fr. Claude Saldhana, S.J., who taught the matriculation class for a number of years. He published the first annual in 1941, mostly with articles by staff members and ex-students. But by the next year the main contributors were the boys. By 1946 the senior students published the annual. It became a magazine published three to four times a year under the name Sevak. It contained articles by students as well as letters from ex-students. After that, staff members took it upon themselves to publish the magazine changing the name to The Paulite. Fr. Pat de Lima, S.J., with a little help from teachers, in particular from Fr. Thomas Ambrose, S.J., took over and published the magazine for many years until his retirement from the school. The magazine ceased publication in 1992, then in 2004 some parents, ex-students, began publishing three or four issues a year. In jubilee year 2006, The Paulite was revived, to give students a chance to practice their skills at communication in prose and poetry. Sports Sports include football, hockey, cricket, and athletics. The Father Eddie Memorial Football tournament for senior boys (under 17) and the Indal Trophy (under 15) are conducted every year on St. Pauls \\"A\\" ground, while the Royceton Memorial Trophy (under 14) is conducted on \\"B\\" ground. The latter draws a large crowd with teams from Goa, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, and other cities.

The settlement forms part of the municipality of √áilov-Neft Da≈ülarƒ± in the Pirallahy raion. It lies away from the Azerbaijani capital Baku, and from the nearest shore in the Caspian Sea. A full town on the sea, it was the first oil platform in Azerbaijan, and the first operating offshore oil platform in the world, incorporating numerous drilling platforms. It is featured in Guinness World Records as the world's first offshore oil platform. The settlement began with a single path out over the water and grew into a system of paths and platforms built on the back of ships sunk to serve as the Neft Da≈ülarƒ±'s foundation. The most distinctive feature of Neft Da≈ülarƒ± is that it is actually a functional city with a population of about 2,000 and over of streets built on piles of dirt and landfill. Etymology The settlement was originally named as Chernie Kamni (\\"Black Stones\\"), but was later renamed to Neft Da≈ülarƒ± (\\"Oily Rocks\\"), replacing the allusion to the black colour of oil with a reference to the substance itself. History=Construction of the settlement Soviet 1971 stamp, featuring Oil Rocks The first large-scale geological study of the area was conducted in 1945‚Äì1948. The settlement of Neft Da≈ülarƒ± was built after oil was discovered there on 7 November 1949, at beneath the Caspian Sea and it became the world's first offshore oil platform. By 1951, the Neft Da≈ülarƒ± was ready for production, equipped with all of the infrastructure needed at the time. Drilling platforms were erected, oil tanks installed, and docks with enclosures for ships were built. The first oil from the Neft Da≈ülarƒ± was loaded into a tanker in the same year. In 1952, the systematic construction of trestle bridges connecting the artificial islands was begun. A number of Soviet factories constructed crane assemblies especially for use on the Neft Da≈ülarƒ±, along with a crane barge that could carry up to 100 tons of oil. The assemblies were equipped with diesel hammers used to drive piles into the sea floor. Large-scale construction started on the settlement in 1958, which included nine-story hostels, hotels, cultural palaces, bakery factories and lemonade workshops. The mass development of Neft Da≈ülarƒ± continued during 1976-1978 with the building of a five-story dormitory and two oil-gas compressor stations, the installation of a drinking water facility, and the construction of two underwater pipelines to the Dubendi terminal, each with a diameter of . In addition, a flyover for vehicular traffic was created. As a result, the area of the settlement grew to around 7 ha in the 1960s, with the length of the steel trestle bridges joining the man-made islands exceeding . Post- independence In November 2009, the settlement celebrated its 60th anniversary. Over the last 60 years, the oilfields of Neft Da≈ülarƒ± have produced more than 170 million tons of oil and 15 billion m¬≥ of associated natural gas. According to present-day estimates by geologists, the volume of recoverable reserves is as high as 30 million tons. The oil platforms have gradually fallen into disrepair, and no refurbishment plans are currently underway.  Demography  The population varies from time to time in the settlement. As of 2008 the platforms have a combined population of about 2,000 men and women, who work in week-long offshore shifts. At one point 5,000 people worked there. Oil extraction The oil extraction is carried out from the shallow water portion of the Absheron geological trend. Accidents On 4 December 2015, three workers of SOCAR were reported missing after part of the living quarters fell into the sea due to a heavy storm. In popular culture * In 2008, a Swiss documentary crew led by film director Marc Wolfensberger filmed \\"La Cit√© du P√©trole / Oil Rocks ‚Äì City above the Sea\\" in the settlement, which was released in 2009.

Sauternes is made from S√©millon, Sauvignon blanc, and Muscadelle grapes that have been affected by Botrytis cinerea, also known as noble rot. This causes the grapes to become partially raisined, resulting in concentrated and distinctively flavored wines. Due to its climate, Sauternes is one of the few wine regions where infection with noble rot is a frequent occurrence. Even so, production is a hit-or-miss proposition, with widely varying harvests from vintage to vintage. Wines from Sauternes, especially the Premier Cru Sup√©rieur estate Ch√¢teau d'Yquem, can be very expensive, largely due to the very high cost of production. Barsac lies within Sauternes and is entitled to use either name. Somewhat similar but less expensive and typically less-distinguished wines are produced in the neighboring regions of Monbazillac, C√©rons, Loupiac and Cadillac. In the United States, there is a semi-generic label for sweet white dessert wines known as sauterne without the \\"s\\" at the end and uncapitalized.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 73-77 Wiley Publishing 2001 History A 1999 Sauternes from La Tour Blanche. This winery was classed Premier Cru in 1855 As in most of France, viticulture is believed to have been introduced into Aquitania by the Romans. The earliest evidence of sweet wine production, however, dates only to the 17th century. While the English had been the region's primary export market since the Middle Ages, their tastes primarily ran to drier wines, starting with clairet in medieval times and eventually shifting to red claret.winepros.com.au. It was the Dutch traders of the 17th century who first developed an interest in white wine. For years they were active in the trade of German wines but production in Germany began to wane in the 17th century as the popularity of beer increased. The Dutch saw an opportunity for a new production source in Bordeaux and began investing in the planting of white grape varieties. They introduced to the region German white wine making techniques, such as halting fermentation with the use of sulphur in order to maintain residual sugar levels. One of these techniques involved taking a candle (known as a \\"brimstone candle\\") with its wick dipped in the sulphur and burned in the barrel that the wine will be fermenting in. This would leave a presence of sulphur in the barrel that the wine would slowly interact with as it was fermenting. Being an anti-microbial agent, sulphur stuns the yeast that stimulates fermentation, eventually bringing it to a halt with high levels of sugars still in the wine. The Dutch began to identify areas that could produce grapes well suited for white wine production and soon homed in on the area of Sauternes. The wine produced from this area was known as vins liquoreux but it is not clear if the Dutch were actively using nobly rotted grapes at this point.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 185-188 Simon and Schuster 1989 Wine expert Hugh Johnson has suggested that the unappealing thought of drinking wine made from fungus-infested grapes may have caused Sauternes producers to keep the use of Botrytis a secret. There are records from the 17th century that by October, S√©millon grapes were known to be infected by rot and vineyard workers had to separate rotted and clean berries but they are incomplete in regards to whether the rotted grapes were used in winemaking. By the 18th century, the practice of using nobly rotted grapes in Tokaji and Germany was well known. It seems that at this point the \\"unspoken secret\\" was more widely accepted and the reputation of Sauternes rose to rival those of the German and Hungarian dessert wines.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 264-266, Simon and Schuster, 1989, By the end of the 18th century, the region's reputation for Sauternes was internationally known: Thomas Jefferson was an avid connoisseur.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 611-612 Oxford University Press 2006 Jefferson recorded that after tasting a sample of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem while President, George Washington immediately placed an order for 30 dozen bottles. Climate and geography The village of Sauternes Like most of the Bordeaux wine region, the Sauternes region has a maritime climate which brings the viticultural hazards of autumn frost, hail and rains that can ruin an entire vintage. The Sauternes region is located southeast of the city of Bordeaux along the Garonne river and its tributary, the Ciron. The source of the Ciron is a spring which has cooler waters than the Garonne. In the autumn, when the climate is warm and dry, the different temperatures from the two rivers meet to produce mist that descends upon the vineyards from evening to late morning. This condition promotes the development of the Botrytis cinerea fungus. By mid day, the warm sun will help dissipate the mist and dry the grapes to keep them from developing less favorable rot. Wine regions The Sauternes wine region comprises five communes‚Äî Barsac, Sauternes, Bommes, Fargues and Preignac. While all five communes are permitted to use the name Sauternes, the Barsac region is also permitted to label their wines under the Barsac appellation. The Barsac region is located on the west bank of the Ciron river where the tributary meets the Garonne. The area sits on an alluvial plain with sandy and limy soils.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 71 Oxford University Press 2006 In general, Barsac wine is distinguished from other Sauternes in being drier with a lighter body; currently more Barsac producers are choosing to promote the wines under their own name. In years when the noble rot does not develop, Sauternes producers will often make dry white wines under the generic Bordeaux AOC. To qualify for the Sauternes label, the wines must have a minimum 13% alcohol level and pass a tasting exam where the wines need to taste noticeably sweet. There is no regulation on the exact amount of residual sugar that the wine needs to have. Wine style and serving Foie gras and Sauternes Sauternes are characterized by the balance of sweetness with the zest of acidity. Some common flavor notes include apricots, honey, peaches but with a nutty note, which is a typical characteristic of noble semillon itself (cf. Australian noble (late-harvest) semillon). The finish can resonate on the palate for several minutes. Sauternes are some of longest-lived wines, with premium examples from exceptional vintages properly kept having the potential to age well even beyond 100 years. Sauternes typically starts out with a golden, yellow color that becomes progressively darker as it ages. Some wine experts believe that only once the wine reaches the color of an old copper coin has it started to develop its more complex and mature flavors. Several Sauternes are sold in half bottles of 375 ml, though larger bottles are also produced. The wines are typically served chilled at though wines older than 15 years are often served a few degrees warmer. Sauternes can be paired with a variety of foods. Foie gras is a classic match.

He served as county engineer, city engineer, city councilman, and mayor. Satrom is most remembered for his 1970‚Äì1972 tenure as mayor of Kent, Ohio, specifically for his request for National Guard assistance in the events leading up to the May 4, 1970 Kent State shootings, where four students were killed and nine wounded. He later served four terms as Portage County engineer, and retired in 1988. He died September 8, 2004 in Ravenna, Ohio. Early life and career Satrom was born in Galesburg, North Dakota. After graduating from high school he worked on the third lock project for the Panama Canal before he joined the United States Army in 1943 and served in Europe during World War II. At the conclusion of his military service in 1946, he attended Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland (now Case Western Reserve University), and graduated in 1947. He first served in Portage County, Ohio, government in 1947 as deputy engineer, a position he held until 1952, and moved to Portage County in 1951. Satrom was first elected to Kent City Council in 1963 after having also served as city engineer for Kent and neighboring Ravenna. Mayor Satrom, a Democrat, was elected in 1969 as the first full-time mayor of Kent, taking office in early 1970. Five months later, after a night of rioting in the downtown area of Kent on May 1‚Äì2, 1970, he called Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes and requested that the National Guard be sent to the campus of Kent State University to deal with the unrest, which was mainly in response to April 29, 1970 announcement of the United States' invasion of Cambodia in the Vietnam War. The Guard was deployed to the campus on May 3 and the city was placed under martial law that evening. On May 4, while breaking up a mid-day protest on the campus, the Guardsmen shot into the crowd, killing four students and wounding nine others. The university was closed immediately and the city of Kent was placed under a 5:00 PM curfew with all entrances to the city blocked off. Satrom seldom appeared at events that placed significance on his role in the Kent State shootings. He stated, however, that he never regretted calling the Guard into Kent, but was \\"shocked and saddened\\" by the events that transpired at Kent State. He said in 1990: \\"It was a very trying time. No one wanted to see people killed. We didn't expect that at all. We wanted them (the Guard) to keep the peace.\\" During his tenure as Mayor of Kent, he also oversaw the transition of the Kent Fire Department from a volunteer force to a full-time force. He was also part of several infrastructure improvements made in Kent during the 1970s, including construction of what became Haymaker Parkway, completed in 1975. He was elected Portage County engineer in 1972 and began his term there in 1973. Later career Satrom subsequently served four terms as Portage County engineer (1973-1988) and remained active in the county political party. In 2004, he donated his papers to Kent State University, which has since put much of the material online. Satrom died September 8, 2004 in Ravenna, Ohio at the age of 85.

It is by far the largest family in the order with around 200 species. Members of the family can be popular, if challenging, aquarium species. These fish are also known for having large brain size and unusually high intelligence. They are not to be confused with the marine and brackish water callorhinchid elephantfish (family Callorhinchidae) of south hemisphere oceans. Description and biology The elephantfishes are a diverse family, with a wide range of different sizes and shapes. The smallest are just in adult length, while the largest reach up to . They do, however, have a number of unique features in common. Firstly, the cerebellum is greatly enlarged, giving them a brain to body size ratio similar to that of humans (though other sources give the brain/body proportion as 'similar to that of birds and marsupials'; Helfman, Collette & Facey 1997, p. 191). This is likely to be related to the interpretation of bio-electrical signals. Secondly, the semicircular canals in the inner ear have an unusual structure and are associated with a gas-filled bladder entirely separate from the main swim bladder. Some species possess modifications of the mouthparts to facilitate feeding upon small invertebrates buried in muddy substrates. The shape and structure of these leads to the popular name of \\"elephant-nosed fish\\" for those species with particularly prominent mouth extensions. The extensions to the mouthparts usually consist of a fleshy elongation attached to the lower jaw. They are flexible, and equipped with touch, and possibly taste, sensors. Their mouths are non-protrusible, and their head (including the eyes), the dorsum and belly are covered by a thin layer of skin that is perforated with small pores leading to electroreceptors. The retina of their eyes is called a \\"grouped retina\\", a type of eye structure seen in mormyrids and a few other fish. Instead of being smooth, their retina is composed of tiny cups, acting like parabolic mirrors. Because of the murky waters, the cones in their eyes have adapted to see only red light. The cups are made of four layers of light reflecting proteins, funneling red light to areas of cones, intensifying its brightness 10-fold, while the rods are hit by light from other wavelengths.Elephant-Nosed Fish Has Funky Eyes, Too Only a single gonad is present, located on the left side of their body.Communication Behavior and Sensory Mechanisms in Weakly Electric Fishes Mormyridae and their close relative Gymnarchus are also unique in being the only vertebrates where the male sperm cell does not have a flagellum. Among those members of the family lacking extended mouthparts, the body shape and general morphology of the fishes has led to some being known among aquarists by the name of \\"baby whale\\", despite the fact that true whales are mammals. Other \\"mormyrid mammalian misnomers\\" include the term \\"dolphin fishes\\", in reference to certain members of the Genus Mormyrops. Electric fields Elephantfishes possess electric organs and are thus notable for their ability to generate weak electric fields that allow the fishes to sense their environment in turbid waters where vision is impaired by suspended matter.Bustami, H.P. (2007). Smart elephant fish navigates in darkness with electric fields. life- of-science.net The generation of these electric fields and their use in providing the fishes with additional sensory input from the environment is the subject of considerable scientific research, as is research into communication between and within species. Electric fish can be classified into two types: pulse fish or wave fish. Pulse-type discharges are characterized by long intervals between electric discharges, whereas wave-type discharges occur when the interval between consecutive pulses is so brief that the discharges fuse together to form a wave. Gymnarchus niloticus is a wave fish, producing a near-sinusoidal discharge of around 500 Hz. The electric discharge is produced from an electric organ that evolved from muscle, as can also be seen in Gymnotiform electric fish, electric rays and skates. The convergent evolution between the South American Gymnotiforms and the African Mormyridae is remarkable, with the electric organ being produced via the substitution of the same amino acid in the same voltage-gated sodium channel despite the two groups of fish being on different continents and the evolution of the electric sense organ being separated in time by around 60 million years. Classification There are about 221 species of elephantfish, grouped into two subfamilies, Mormyrinae and Petrocephalinae.

It is one of a series of novels featuring the character Arturo Bandini as Fante's alter ego, a young Italian-American from Colorado struggling to make it as a writer in Los Angeles. The novel is widely regarded as an American classic, regularly on college syllabi for American literature. The book is a roman √† clef, much of it rooted in autobiographical incidents in Fante's life. The novel influenced Charles Bukowski significantly. In 2006, screenwriter Robert Towne adapted the novel into a film, Ask the Dust, starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell.  Publication  Initial publication of the novel followed Fante's successful publication of Wait Until Spring, Bandini and his short stories in prominent publications such as The American Mercury. Only 2,200 copies of the first edition of the novel were printed. Although sales were not extensive, a paperback edition was issued by Bantam in 1954. The novel's popularity did not reach its peak until poet Charles Bukowski led the reissue of the novel by Black Sparrow Press in 1980, alongside a foreword by Bukowski. Synopsis Arturo Bandini is a struggling writer living in a residential hotel in Bunker Hill, a rundown section of Downtown Los Angeles. Living off the zest of oranges, he unconsciously creates a picture of Los Angeles as a modern dystopia during the Great Depression era. His published short story \\"The Little Dog Laughed\\" impresses no one in his seedy boarding house except for one 14-year-old girl, Judy. Destitute, he wanders into the Columbia Buffet where he meets Camilla Lopez, a waitress. Bandini falls in love with Lopez, who is herself in love with co-worker Sam. Sam despises Camilla, telling Bandini if he wants to win over Camilla, he has to treat her poorly. Bandini struggles with his own poverty, his Catholic guilt, and with his love for an unstable and deteriorating Camilla. Camilla is eventually admitted to a mental hospital, and moved to a second one, before escaping. Bandini looks for her, only finding her as she awaits for him in his apartment. He decides to take her away from Los Angeles, and arranges to live in a house on the beach. He buys her a little dog and they go to the new place. He leaves her there, to get his belongings from his Los Angeles hotel room. When he returns, she's gone. He tracks her down to the desert home of Sam, who is ill and dying. Before Bandini arrives, Sam has thrown Camilla out and she wanders into the desert. Bandini looks for her with an agonizing fear that he won't find the woman he loves, and he doesn't. He returns to Sam's shack, looks over the empty desert land. He takes a copy of the novel he had recently published, dedicates it to Camilla, and throws it into the desert. Themes Fante's most popular novel by far, the semi-autobiographical Ask the Dust is the third book in what is now referred to as \\"The Saga of Arturo Bandini\\" or \\"The Bandini Quartet\\". Bandini served as his alter ego in a total of four novels: Wait Until Spring, Bandini (1938), The Road to Los Angeles (chronologically, this is the first novel Fante wrote but it was unpublished until 1985), Ask the Dust (1939) and, finally, Dreams from Bunker Hill (1982). The last Fante dictated to his wife, Joyce, towards the end of his life after complications from diabetes brought about blindness and the amputation of both legs. Fante's use of Bandini as his alter ego can be compared to Charles Bukowski's character, Henry Chinaski. Recurring themes in Fante's works are poverty, Catholicism, family life, Italian-American identity, sports, and the life of a writer. Ask the Dust has been referred to over the years as a monumental Southern California/Los Angeles novel by many (e.g.: Carey McWilliams, Charles Bukowski, and The Los Angeles Times Book Review). More than sixty years after it was published, Ask the Dust appeared for several weeks on the New York Times' Bestseller's List.  Reception  Initial reception of the novel was mixed, resulting in poor sales. Distribution was hampered because Fante's publisher was embroiled in a legal dispute over publication of an unauthorized version of Adolf Hitler's biography \\"Mein Kampf\\" that left it short of funds. https://gen.medium.com/how-hitler-nearly- destroyed-the-great-american-novel-ed5f7bb77aeb Legacy Fante was one of the first writers to portray the tough times faced by many people in Depression-era Los Angeles. Robert Towne has called Ask the Dust the greatest novel ever written about Los Angeles. The American author Charles Bukowski cites John Fante's work as a significant influence on his own writing, in particular Ask the Dust ‚Äì which he had stumbled upon in the public library, while a young writer. Bukowski's enthusiasm for the novel helped ensure that the novel didn't fall into obscurity in the 1970s. Bukowski, who befriended the older author towards the end of Fante's life, wrote a foreword to this novel for the Black Sparrow Press reprint edition. Bukowski states in this foreword: \\"Fante was my god\\".Fante, J., 1980, Ask the Dust, Black Sparrow Press, Santa Barbara. Introduction by Charles Bukowski Bukowski chronicled their relationship in his short story \\"I Meet the Master\\", although in the story, the author is referred to as \\"John Bante\\" and his book is called Sporting Times? Yeah?. Ask the Dust contains thematic similarities to Knut Hamsun's 1890 novel Hunger. Fante was a great admirer of Hamsun. The title Ask the Dust derives from Knut Hamsun's novel Pan from 1894, in which Lt. Glahn tells the story about the girl in the tower: > \\"The other one he loved like a slave, like a crazed and like a beggar. Why? > Ask the dust on the road and the falling leaves, ask the mysterious God of > life; for no one knows such things. She gave him nothing, no nothing did she > give him and yet he thanked her. She said: Give me your peace and your > reason! And he was only sorry she did not ask for his life.\\" In David Foster Wallace's 1987 novel The Broom of the System, Lavache \\"Stoney\\" Beadsman has a wooden leg with a hidden drawer in which he keeps marijuana cigarettes and other illegal substances. Chapter 4 of Ask the Dust refers to a character named Benny Cohen, who \\"had a wooden leg with a little door in it. Inside the door were marijuana cigarettes. He sold them for fifteen cents apiece\\" (37).

The Supreme Court's decision declared the blockade of the Southern ports ordered by President Abraham Lincoln constitutional.. The opinion in the case was written by Supreme Court Justice Robert Cooper Grier. Background Facing the secession of several states from the Union and the possibility of open hostilities, Abraham Lincoln did not ask Congress to declare war on the Confederate States of America as he believed this would be tantamount to recognizing the Confederacy as a nation. Instead, Lincoln instituted a naval blockade which had important legal ramifications because nations do not blockade their own ports; rather, they close them. By ordering a blockade, Lincoln essentially declared the Confederacy to be belligerents instead of insurrectionists. The Confederate States were mostly agrarian, and almost all of their machined and manufactured goods were imported. At the beginning of the war there was only one significant steel mill and manufactory in the South, the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia. Moreover, the Southern economy depended on the export of cotton, tobacco and other crops. The blockade of the South resulted in the capture of dozens of American and foreign ships, both those attempting to run the highly efficient blockade and smuggle goods and munitions to the South as well as those attempting to smuggle exports from the South. Decision The question before the court dealt with the seized ships, but it reached widely into the legality of wars against acts of belligerence, whether or not officially declared. It rose through the lower Federal courts through lawsuits by Northern merchants whose ships were seized by U.S. Navy warships enforcing the blockade. In admiralty, a ship captured during war may be kept as a prize. If there is no formal war, capturing ships and impounding them is piracy. Plaintiffs contended that the blockade was not legal because a war had not been declared, thus making it perfectly legal to run the blockade and sell war materiel in the blockaded Southern ports. The government's case was argued by U.S. Attorney Richard Henry Dana Jr., the author of Two Years Before the Mast. On March 10, 1863, the Court ruled that the states of the Southern Confederacy were in insurrection and at war against the United States by acts of belligerency on April 12 and April 17, 1861, to wit: the firing upon Fort Sumter and the Privateering Act proclaimed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Lincoln's Proclamation of Blockade was made on April 19, 1861, [Navy Official Records, Series 1, Volume 5, page 620] two days after Davis's call for privateers and it was founded upon acting against privateers, not an open policy of warfare as was later recommended by the ranking General of the Army, Winfield Scott. In making its decision, the Court looked to recent British interpretations of international law, and concluded that the Southern Confederacy was indeed a belligerent, but a belligerent did not have to be a nation and furthermore that the name of the war was irrelevant. Justice Robert Grier wrote the 5-4 majority opinion stating, \\"[I]t is not necessary to constitute war, that both parties should be acknowledged as independent nations or sovereign States.\\" While the court acknowledged that the United States Congress had, in July 1861, adopted a law ratifying and approving the President's proclamation after the fact, as well as other actions taken since then to prosecute the war, that was not the point. Grier further wrote, \\"The President was bound to meet it [the war] in the shape it presented itself, without waiting for Congress to baptize it with a name.\\" By this decision, the Supreme Court upheld the President's executive powers to act in accordance with the Presidential oath of office, \\"to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States\\" and to act expediently as the Commander-in- Chief in time of war‚Äîa de facto war existing since April 12, 1861. Dissent by Justice Nelson The dissenting opinion by the Court noted that the President is not given authority by the Constitution to declare war; the power to declare war lies with Congress. The Civil War did not exist until it was declared so by Congress. Lincoln ordered the blockade before Congress had declared a war. As such, Nelson and the minority believed that the blockade was unconstitutional. They further contend that even had Lincoln been granted the authority for the blockade, he would need to provide the neutral parties with a proper notice of seizure. Conclusion The Supreme Court found the decision by President Lincoln to impose a blockade to be constitutional.

They can be found in most churches built before the 19th century and were the main source of funds for poor relief before societies decided to organize the process and make the public authorities responsible for this. Contemporary mite boxes are usually made of cardboard and given out to church congregations during the Lenten season. The mite boxes are collected by the church, and the donations are given to the poor. Mite boxes are popular with children because they can fill them with small change, teaching them the principle of giving to the poor. The Mite box giving promotes the spirit of contributing based on the intent to help others and not on the monetary amount.  History  The origin of the mite box is very old. In 2 Kings 12:9, the priest Jehoiada bored a hole in the lid of a chest and placed it near the first altar, however this was to fund maintenance rather than alms. Pope Innocent III, at the end of the twelfth century, allowed some mite boxes to be placed in churches so that the faithful people may at any time dispose their alms. Many Catholic parish churches in Ireland have two collection boxes, one \\"for the church\\" and the other \\"for the poor\\". Mite Widow's Mite or Lepton, minted by Alexander Jannaeus, King of Judaea, 103‚Äì76 B.C. obverse: anchor upside-down in circle, reverse: star of eight rays. The term mite, according to the dictionary, is defined as any of the following: # a very small contribution or amount of money, such as a widow's mite. # a very small object, creature, or particle. # a coin of very small value, especially an obsolete British coin worth half a farthing. An alms box is a strong chest or box often fastened to the wall of a church to receive offerings for the poor. The etymology of the word mite comes through Middle English and Middle Dutch from the Middle Low German mƒ´te, a small Flemish coin or tiny animal. In biblical times a mite or lepton was a small coin of almost no worth.

He is perhaps best known for his time with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW), where he wrestled between the promotion's early days in 1990 until the promotion's closure in 2002, making him the longest-tenured wrestler in the company's history. Fuji initially joined FMW as a mid-carder, who initially teamed and feuded with the promotion's founder Atsushi Onita on several occasions. He was a part of many groups including Team Canada and Lethal Weapon during the mid-1990s while also achieving success in the company's junior heavyweight division, winning the AWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship once each. Professional wrestling career=Early career Masanori Morimura started training in the NJPW Dojo in 1984, but left the dojo because he was \\"young and dumb\\". While at the NJPW Dojo, he wanted to be a UWF fighter instead. When he failed to join UWF, he realized he ruined his chances at beginning his career in Japan. He then left Japan in January 1987 for a training expedition in Canada, where he was trained in the Dungeon by Stu Hart and his right-hand man, Mr. Hito. During his time training in Calgary, he suffered a couple major injuries, including a brain hemorrhage, which he fully recovered from. During his training, he would befriend other Japanese stars like Hiroshi Hase and his former NJPW Dojo mates Keiichi Yamada and Shinya Hashimoto. Canada (1988‚Äì1990) On June 28, 1988, Morimura made his professional wrestling debut in Stampede Wrestling against Hart's son, Ross, under the name Tiger Mask (not the same as Satoru Sayama), at a show in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. After a couple of matches, he evolved into Black Tomcat. In August 1988, Black Tomcat was one of many wrestlers cut from Stampede, and joined the North Western Wrestling Federation and later won the promotion's Junior Heavyweight Championship, his first title, after defeating Steve Gillespie. In March 1989, Black Tomcat left the NWWF for the Canadian Independent Wrestling Federation, ran by Les Thornton. After losing a loser leaves town match to Kid Chaos in June 1989, he unmasked and started wrestling under the ring name Ricky Fuji and adopted a rock star gimmick. During his time in the CIWF, he was scouted by the World Wrestling Federation after Bruce Hart introduced him to his brother Bret, but no deal was ever finalized, as they didn't know how to bring him in. Later that year, he would become the promotion's final Junior Heavyweight Champion, before the promotion folded by the end of 1989. In January 1990, Fuji returned to Japan and trained with former NJPW star Masanobu Kurisu and was offered a spot in the upstart promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling by Atsushi Onita, which he accepted. Frontier Martial-Arts WrestlingDebut (1990)= Upon debuting for FMW in May 1990, Fuji quickly became over with the fans, particularly among female fans, due to his Shawn Michaels-inspired gimmick and promo skills. He debuted for FMW by defeating The Shooter on May 12, 1990. He quickly established himself as an arrogant villain and entered a rivalry with FMW owner Atsushi Onita, as Fuji and Masanobu Kurisu lost to the team of Onita and Tarzan Goto in a match, a day later on May 13, marking Fuji competing in a FMW main event, just in his second match with the company. On June 2, Fuji competed in his first deathmatch, a stretcher street fight against Tarzan Goto, which Fuji lost. On June 6, Fuji received his first title shot in FMW as he unsuccessfully challenged Lee Gak Soo for the AWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. Tarzan Goto would soon enter a feud with Onita and Fuji formed an alliance with Onita's rivals Tarzan Goto and Mr. Pogo in the summer of 1990. On July 22, Fuji participated in a thirteen-man battle royal, which took place in a ring placed in the Miyazaki Nichinan Sea. Fuji went on to win the battle royal by last eliminating Kim Hyun Hwan. At Summer Spectacular, Fuji was paired with Mr. Pogo and Katsuji Ueda as the trio defeated Kim Hyun Han, Lee Gak Soo and Sambo Asako in a six-man tag team match. Fuji received another shot against Lee Gak Soo for the World Light Heavyweight Championship on August 18 but failed to win the title. On August 20, Fuji and Pogo lost a street fight to Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako, after which Fuji turned into a fan favorite for the first time in his career as he teamed with Onita on the following day against Pogo and Gran Mendoza in a losing effort. In September, Fuji entered a tournament for the vacant World Light Heavyweight Championship, defeating Jang Yong Wow in the quarter-final before losing to eventual winner Katsuji Ueda in the semi-final. On October 26, Fuji participated in Japan's first intergender tag team match, teaming with Megumi Kudo in a loss to Tarzan Goto and his wife Despina Montagas. At the promotion's 1st Anniversary Show in November, Fuji teamed with Akihito Ichihara against The Shooter and Billy Mack in a losing effort. =World Light Heavyweight Champion and teaming with Sambo Asako (1991-1992)= In January 1991, Fuji teamed with Tarzan Goto to participate in a tag team tournament, in which the team qualified for the knockout stage by scoring three points in the round-robin stage. They were eliminated from the knockout stage by losing to Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako in the quarter-final on January 15. He continued to team with Goto and Onita to wrestle Mr. Pogo and his allies in several matches. On May 29, Fuji was booked to win his first title in FMW by defeating Jimmy Backlund to capture the World Light Heavyweight Championship. He began feuding with Mark Starr after successfully defending the title against Starr in his first title defense on June 21. On August 17, Fuji entered the Barbed Wire Deathmatch Tournament, in which he defeated Starr in the quarter-final round before losing to eventual winner Atsushi Onita via forfeit in the semi-final. Fuji dropped the World Light Heavyweight Championship to Starr on August 24. At the 2nd Anniversary Show in September, Fuji was paired with Sambo Asako against Big Titan and The Gladiator in a street fight, which Fuji's team lost. In the fall of 1991, Fuji and Asako participated in the World's Strongest Tag Team Tournament for the newly created WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Championship. They qualified for the play-off by scoring seven points in the round-robin stage and lost to the eventual winners Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto in the play-off. At 3rd Anniversary Show, Fuji teamed with Sambo Asako and The Great Punk against Big Titan, The Gladiator and Horace Boulder in a stretcher street fight in a losing effort. =Team Canada (1993-1994)= On January 12, 1993, Ricky Fuji turned on his teammates The Great Punk, Mr. Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto in an elimination tag team match against the team of Big Titan, Dr. Luther, The Gladiator and The Sheik, which led to Fuji turning into a villain. He formed a faction with Titan, Luther and Gladiator called Team Canada, based on Fuji's own time in Canada in the past. Sheik would eventually depart the group to form an alliance with Atsushi Onita. Team Canada quickly became FMW's top villainous group and feuded with the likes of Onita, Tarzan Goto, Mr. Gannosuke, The Sheik and Sabu among others. At 4th Anniversary Show, Fuji teamed with his Team Canada stablemates Big Titan and The Gladiator, defeating Katsuji Ueda, The Great Punk and Tarzan Goto in a Captain's Fall Losing Captain Leaves Town No Rope Barbed Wire Tornado Street Fight Deathmatch. Fuji then defeated Mercurio in his next major match at Summer Spectacular. In September, Fuji entered a tournament for the new Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship, in which he lost to Atsushi Onita, Jr. in the opening round. At Year End Spectacular, the team of Fuji, Titan and Gladiator defeated Sambo Asako, Katsuji Ueda and Grigory Verichev in a street fight. In early 1994, Fuji participated in a tournament for the new Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, in which he was paired with Terry Simms, losing to Jinsei Shinzaki and Masaru Toi in a barbed wire street fight in the first round, leading to Fuji and Simms being demoted to Loser's Block B, where they ended up losing to Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya in a barbed wire deathmatch. In April, Fuji entered the inaugural Super J-Cup tournament, where he defeated Negro Casas in the first round, but lost to Jushin Thunder Liger in the quarter-final round. The following month, in May, Fuji teamed with his Team Canada stablemates Big Titan and The Gladiator to take on WAR's Fuyuki-Gun (Hiromichi Fuyuki, Jado and Gedo) in an interpromotional six-man tag team match at 5th Anniversary Show. During the match, a miscommunication took place between Titan and Gladiator. Gladiator won the match for his team but then abandoned Fuji and Titan after the match. Fuji toured a few events for Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) in June, where he won the vacant Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling's (CRMW) North American Mid-Heavyweight Championship by defeating Terry Boy on June 16. Fuji then returned to FMW, defeating Mach Hayato at Summer Spectacular. Shortly after, Team Canada disbanded after the departure of Big Titan from FMW in December. =Independent World Junior Heavyweight Champion and Lethal Weapon (1994-1996)= On December 20, 1994, Fuji defeated The Great Sasuke to win the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship. He successfully defended the title against Battle Ranger Z in his first title defense on January 6, 1995. He lost the title to Hideki Hosaka in his second title defense on February 6. Soon after the title loss, Fuji formed a new faction called Lethal Weapon with Tarzan Goto and Hisakatsu Oya, although Goto would soon after leave FMW in April 1995. At 6th Anniversary Show, Fuji and Oya defeated Mr. Pogo and Yukihiro Kanemura of the W*ING Alliance to capture the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship and their tag team was named Love Guns, Lethal Weapon's resident tag team. Following the departure of Tarzan Goto, Fuji and Oya would later recruit The Gladiator, Mr. Pogo and Horace Boulder into Lethal Weapon. The group would briefly takeover W*ING Alliance as the top villainous faction in FMW. Fuji and Oya lost the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship four months later to Daisuke Ikeda and Yoshiaki Fujiwara on September 5. During the fall of 1995, Lethal Weapon began transitioning into fan favorites after W*ING Alliance betrayed both FMW and Lethal Weapon during a tag team match. Lethal Weapon would then side with FMW to feud with W*ING. Fuji headlined December's Year End Spectacular event by teaming with Super Delfin and Taka Michinoku against the team of Hayabusa, The Great Sasuke and Koji Nakagawa in a losing effort. Fuji participated in the first WarGames match in FMW history on February 23, 1996, by teaming with Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to defeat W*ING Alliance members Hido, W*ING Kanemura and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, thus ending the feud of FMW and Lethal Weapon against W*ING. The match was followed by the debut of the new group Puerto Rican Army, which took over as FMW's new villainous group by luring away several key members of W*ING and Lethal Weapon. At 7th Anniversary Show, Fuji teamed with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) to defeat the team of Crypt Keeper, Boogie Man and Freddy Krueger. On July 31, Fuji, Oya and Gladiator unsuccessfully challenged Koji Nakagawa, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda for the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. On September 15, Fuji's tag team partners Horace Boulder and The Gladiator turned on Fuji after the trio lost a match to Hideki Hosaka, Hido and Taka Michinoku. The entire Lethal Weapon group turned on Fuji to join Puerto Rican Army, thus forcing Lethal Weapon to disband. =Various rivalries (1997-2002)= Following Lethal Weapon's disbandment, Fuji aligned himself with Hayabusa and began competing as a mid-card wrestler on the FMW side, often assisting him in his rivalries with Mr. Gannosuke and Kodo Fuyuki. Fuji competed in the opening match of the 8th Anniversary Show, teaming with Ricky Morton to defeat Hido and Dragon Winger. At Shiodome Legend, Fuji successfully defended the CRMW North American Middleweight Championship against Hayato Nanjyo. He lost the title to Gedo on August 31. At Fall Spectacular, Fuji participated in a twelve-man Royal Rumble match, where he lasted until the final two when he was eliminated by Tetsuhiro Kuroda. His success dwindled in FMW and was relegated to mid-card matches. He balanced competing in singles, tag team, and six-man tag team matches. On January 7, 1998, Fuji wrestled a special match under the ring name Morimura on a ZEN-produced show, defeating Sunao Gosaku and El Pandita in a three-way dance. Fuji competed at FMW's first pay-per-view event 9th Anniversary Show, where he teamed with John Kronus in a loss to Jado and Gedo on April 30. On August 15, he resurrected his masked Black Tomcat persona from his days in Canada, for one night only on a Michinoku Pro Wrestling card, in which he lost to Super Delfin. Later that year, he joined Hayabusa's Team Phoenix to feud with Team No Respect. In the fall of 1998, Fuji participated in an Over the Top Tournament to determine the #1 contender for the FMW Double Championship (the unified Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship), where he lost to Masao Orihara in the opening round at ECW/FMW Supershow I. On May 5, 1999, Fuji took on Minoru Tanaka in a match for the vacant Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship, which Tanaka won. In the summer of 1999, Fuji began feuding with the FMW President Shoichi Arai after Arai turned on FMW to join Team No Respect, leading to a match between the two at Haunted House, which Arai won after Giant Steele made his FMW debut and attacked Fuji. Fuji would eventually gain revenge by teaming with Masato Tanaka to defeat Kodo Fuyuki and Shoichi Arai at Hayabusa Graduation Ceremony on August 23. At the Last Match pay-per-view on August 25, Fuji teamed with Naohiko Yamazaki in a loss to Super Leather and Chris Youngblood. At 10th Anniversary Show on November 23, Fuji teamed with Chocoball Mukai and Flying Kid Ichihara to defeat Team No Respect members Koji Nakagawa, Jado and Gedo in a ladder match to win the vacant WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Nakagawa, Jado and Gedo on December 11, ending their reign at eighteen days. In April 2000, Fuji entered the 2000 Super J-Cup, where he defeated Sasuke the Great in the first round, but lost to Gran Hamada in the quarterfinals. The following month, Fuji defeated Crazy Boy in the opening match of the 11th Anniversary Show. Later that year, Fuji gained a victory over former tag team partner Chocoball Mukai in the opening match of the Deep Throat pay-per-view. At 12th Anniversary Show, Fuji teamed with Makita to defeat Morita and Yoshihito Sasaki in a tag team match. On May 22, 2001, Fuji reunited with former Lethal Weapon member Hisakatsu Oya and Flying Kid Ichihara to defeat Azusa Kudo, Shinjuku Shark and Naohiko Yamazaki for the vacant WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship, winning the title for a second time. They held the title for two months until losing to Kodo Fuyuki, Mr. Gannosuke and Kintaro Kanemura on July 30. On February 3, 2002, Fuji wrestled his last FMW match, in which he teamed with Shinjuku Shark against GOEMON and Hisakatsu Oya in a losing effort. A day later, on February 4, FMW held its last event and Shoichi Arai closed the company due to bankruptcy on February 15. Freelance (2002‚Äì2012) Since FMW's closing, Fuji has been wrestling as a freelancer for various Japanese independent promotions, including Wrestling Marvelous Future, Apache Pro-Wrestling, and FREEDOMS. On September 17, 2011, Fuji teamed with Bambi and Yuji Hino to win the Chiba Six Man Tag Team Championship after defeating Little Galaxy (Hiro Tonai, Shiori Asahi and Yuki Sato). The championship is Fuji's first in a major promotion since May 2001. On October 2, Fuji, Bambi and Hino were successful in their first title defense after defeating Daigoro Kashiwa, Marines Mask II and Tigers Mask. Kaientai Dojo / Action Advance Pro Wrestling (2012‚Äìpresent) On January 4, 2012, Kaientai Dojo confirmed that they signed Ricky Fuji for one yearl; he has remained with the promotion ever since. On February 5, 2012, Fuji had a chance to win the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship at a Freedoms show against Hiroki, but failed. After the match, he got on the microphone and announced his goal of winning the belt by the end of the year, after looking at the \\"FMW\\" letters still engraved on the belt. On January 26, 2013, after nearly a year after his announced his intentions, Fuji finally won the Independent World Junior Heavyweight title from Hiroki, ending his nearly 15-month reign. He would hold onto the title for nearly four months, before losing the title to Nanjyo Hayato. On June 16, Fuji and Daigoro Kashiwa defeated Hiroki and Yuji Hino to win the vacant Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Kazma Sakamoto and Kengo Mashimo on September 16. Upon Taka Michinoku's departure and the renaming of the company to Action-Advance Pro Wrestling (2AW) in 2019, Fuji was chosen to run the day-to-day operations, as well as being in the active roster. In January 2020, Fuji announced that 2AW is now the Japanese affiliate for Allied Independent Wrestling Federations. Return to FMW (2015‚Äìpresent) On March 4, 2015, it was confirmed by Flying Kid Ichihara and Choden Senshi Battle Ranger that Ricky Fuji is confirmed as one of the seven FMW originals to rejoin FMW. On April 21, 2015, Fuji defeated Battle Ranger in the opening match of the promotion's first show in 13 years. Outside of wrestling Outside of wrestling, Fuji runs his own gym in Chiba called Endo's Gym, and also plays in two rock bands, Crazy Crew (which includes The Great Sasuke and Ken45¬∞) and The Heavyweighters.

The first dirigent protein was discovered in Forsythia intermedia. This protein has been found to direct the stereoselective biosynthesis of (+)-pinoresinol from coniferyl alcohol monomers: Reaction of monolignol radicals in the presence of dirigent protein to form (+)-pinoresinol Lignan biosynthesis is catalysed by oxidative enzymes. In the test tube the reaction results in a heteregenous mixture of dimeric compounds. When dirigent protein is present during the reaction, one stereoisomer of one compound is highly enriched. Dirigent proteins appear to possess no oxidative radical forming activity of their own; in the absence of oxidative enzyme, no reaction will occur. Recently, a second, enantiocomplementary dirigent protein was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, which directs enantioselective synthesis of (-)-pinoresinol.  Activity  In lignan biosynthesis, oxidative enzymes perform proton coupled electron transfer to remove a hydrogen atom from monolignols, forming a radical intermediate. These intermediates then couple in a radical termination reaction to form one of a variety of dimers, known as lignans. In vitro reactions of coniferyl alcohol (a common monolignol) in the presence of oxidative enzymes produce a wide variety of different dimers at varying concentrations. When dirigent protein from \\"Forsythia intermedia\\" is present, production of (+)-pinoresinol is greatly enriched, and other products are far less abundant. Because this enrichment is so pronounced, the enzyme is hypothesized to produce (+)-pinoresinol exclusively, and to compete with the non-protein-mediated coupling reaction, which produces a heterologous mix of products. This has been confirmed by analyzing the various mixtures produced with different concentrations of dirigent proteins present. The mechanism by which this stereoselectivity is achieved is not well understood at this time. However, since no reaction proceeds in the absence of oxidative enzymes, dirigent protein does not itself appear to catalyze the oxidation of coniferyl alcohol to form radicals. In the presence of dirigent protein from Forsythia intermedia, production of (+)-pinoresinol is greatly enriched while production of other products of dimerization is inhibited. The activity of dirigent protein from Forsythia intermedia is specific to coniferyl alcohol. When other monolignols, such as p-coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, are reacted in vitro with oxidative enzymes in the presence of dirigent protein, they produce a heterologous mixture of products indistinguishable from identical experiments in the absence of dirigent protein. Structure Circular dichroism experiments have shown that the secondary structure of dirigent protein from Forsythia intermedia is composed primarily of Œ≤-pleated sheets and loop structures. The tertiary structure has not been solved, but the protein has been confirmed to be dimeric. Each dimer has a single binding site for coniferyl alcohol, for a total of two binding sites. One coniferyl alcohol can bind to each site, so that the reaction geometry between the two is confined, increasing the production of (+)-pinoresinol and inhibiting the production of other products. Biological importance In the absence of dirigent protein, pinoresinol is a relatively minor product of lignan biosynthesis. When dirigent protein is present, it becomes the major product. The biological significance of (+)-pinoresinol in plants is not fully understood, but it has been found to be effective as a feeding deterrent against ants in caterpillars of the cabbage butterfly, which obtain the compound from their diet. It may serve a similar defensive purpose in Forsythia intermedia.

The gliding workers do not have wings. Gliding ants are arboreal ants of several different genera that are able to control the direction of their descent when falling from a tree. Living in the rainforest canopy like many other gliders, gliding ants use their gliding to return to the trunk of the tree they live on should they fall or be knocked off a branch. Gliding was first discovered for Cephalotes atratus in the Peruvian rainforest. At least five genera in the subfamilies Myrmicinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, and Formicinae (mostly Camponotus) display gliding of various degrees, in an example of parallel evolution. All species in the genus Cephalotes (within Myrmicinae) tested to date show this ability, as do many species within Pseudomyrmecinae.

This adaptation helps to keep ants from getting lost or killed on the forest floor, away from their treetop nests. During a fall, gliding ants use visual cues to locate tree trunks. Specifically, they orient to light-colored columnar objects that sharply contrast the darker background of foliage in the forest. Tropical trees often have light-coloured bark and frequently are covered with white lichens, thus they provide the most conspicuous targets. In a typical fall a descent by a gliding ant is \\"J-shaped\\".Dudley, R., Byrnes, G., Yanoviak S.P., Borrell, B., Brown, R.M., and McGuire, J.A. \\"Gliding and the Functional Origins of Flight: Biomechanical Novelty or Necessity?. \\" Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics.

The glide ant then, while exhibiting a sort of parachuting behaviour to slow its fall, uses its flattened head, hind legs and abdomen like wings or a parachute to make a rapid adjustment to point its abdomen (or head) towards the tree trunk. The ant then turns upside down and lands on the trunk, head facing the earth. The period of free fall is thought to be used by the ants to slow down to a minimum viable glide velocity, to allow them to successfully direct their descent towards the tree. This explains why smaller ants have been observed to reach their trees sooner than do larger ants. A smaller body mass makes it easier to slow to the minimum viable glide velocity, allowing smaller ants to gain control of their falls more quickly. Many ants use long, flattened legs and wide, flanged heads to act as parachutes to control the direction of their descent, although controlled descent has also been observed in species of Pseudomyrmecinae that have more cylindrical bodies. Gliding is not observed in all arboreal ants.

Both genera lived during the Late Triassic in what is now La Rioja Province, Argentina. Marasuchus contains a single species, Marasuchus lilloensis. Marasuchus lilloensis was originally designated as Lagosuchus lilloensis in 1972. It was considered a new species of Lagosuchus, a contemporary archosaur described the previous year. However, a 1994 study argued that the original material of Lagosuchus was undiagnostic. This would mean that Lagosuchus and its original species (Lagosuchus talampayaensis) could be considered nomen dubia. Specimens of Lagosuchus stored at a museum in San Miguel de Tucuman were considered to be more diagnostic than those of L. talampayensis, and thus they were given a new genus: Marasuchus. A 2019 study redescribed the original material of Lagosuchus and concluded that it was valid and not readily distinguishable from Marasuchus lilloensis. This suggests that Marasuchus lilloensis is a junior synonym of Lagosuchus talampayensis. Specimens referred to the genus Marasuchus possessed some, but not all of the adaptations which traditionally characterized dinosaurs. For example, its proportions indicate that it was likely bipedal as in early dinosaurs. Also, it shared certain specific characteristics with that group, most relating to the hip and the head of the femur. Nevertheless, it lacked certain dinosaur-like features such as a perforated acetabulum, and it had several plesiomorphic (\\"primitive\\") features of the ankle.  Discovery and history  Marasuchus hails from the Cha√±ares Formation of Argentina. This formation has been dated to the early Carnian (the first stage of the Late Triassic), about 235 to 234 million years old. Many Chanares fossils, including the first known remains of Marasuchus, were unearthed as a result of a 1964-1965 paleontological expedition. This expedition was undertaken by paleontologists from the MCZ (Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard) and the MLP (Museo de La Plata in La Plata, Argentina). Discoveries made during the expedition were later described in a series of papers by Alfred Romer from the MCZ. Around the same time, further expeditions by Jose Bonaparte of the PVL (Paleontolog√≠a de Vertebrados, Instituto ‚ÄòMiguel Lillo‚Äô in San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina) unearthed additional fossils from the area. Marasuchus lilloensis is known from several specimens representing most of the animal's skeletal anatomy, although skull material remains limited. The holotype, PVL 3871, was collected by Bonaparte in 1969 and was initially known as \\"the Tucuman specimen\\". This specimen consists of large portions of the tail, left forelimb, hip, and hindlimbs. Other Marasuchus fossils are stored at the PVL as well. PVL 3870 includes skull material, the entire presacral vertebral column, and a nearly complete hip and hindlimbs. PVL 3872 is a braincase and associated cervical (neck) vertebrae. PVL 4670 and 4671 each consist of vertebrae from the base of the tail, while PVL 4672 is a sequence of cervical and dorsal (trunk) vertebrae. The referral of PVL 4670 to Marasuchus (or Lagosuchus) is uncertain due to the absence of diagnostic features clearly shared with other specimens. Relation to Lagosuchus When the Tucuman specimen was first described by Romer in 1972, it was placed as the type specimen of a new species, Lagosuchus lilloensis. Lagosuchus talampayensis, the type species of Lagosuchus, had been named a few papers earlier in 1971. The two species were differentiated mainly on the basis of the Tucuman specimen being larger than the type specimen of L. talampayensis. In his 1975 review of the genus, Jose Bonaparte regarded the two species as synonymous, with L. lilloensis as a junior synonym of L. talampayensis. Many other sources published between 1972 and 1994 followed this conclusion. However, a later study by Paul Sereno and Andrea Arcucci (1994) concluded that the original type specimen of Lagosuchus was poorly preserved and undiagnostic. They argued against assigning other specimens to the genus Lagosuchus, which they regarded as a nomen dubium. They also noted that many referred PVL specimens had limb proportions and other subtle traits differing from Lagosuchus specimens stored elsewhere. On this basis, a new genus was erected to contain the PVL specimens. This new genus was called Marasuchus (\\"Mara crocodile\\"), a nod to the etymology of Lagosuchus (\\"Rabbit crocodile\\"). It was given the specific name Marasuchus lilloensis, based on Romer's species designation for the Tucuman specimen. Between 1994 and 2019, Marasuchus was considered a more diagnostic and well-described replacement name for the dinosauriform taxon known previously as Lagosuchus. In 2019, the type specimen of Lagosuchus was re-examined by Federico Agnolin and Martin Ezcurra, who noted that the type specimen actually does share several of the diagnostic traits identified by Sereno and Arucci for Marasuchus. Furthermore, they argued that variations in size and certain features of the skeleton were either ontogenetic or individually variable. As a result, they referred the PVL specimens back to Lagosuchus. Following their conclusion, Marasuchus lilloensis could be considered a synonym of Lagosuchus talampayensis once more.  Description  Life restoration of M. lilloensis with featherlike filaments In terms of proportions, Marasuchus generally resembled early theropod dinosaurs like Coelophysis. The limbs were long and slender, with the hindlimbs about twice the length of the forelimbs. These proportions meant that it was probably bipedal and had acquired the upright stance characteristic of dinosaurs. The neck was long, with an S-shaped curve as its default position, while the tail was very long and thin, though deeper at its base. The type specimen of Marasuchus (PVL 3871) had a femur which was 5.75 cm (2.26) inches in length, about 40-50% larger than the type specimen of Lagosuchus talampayensis. Nevertheless, Marasuchus was still a small and lightly built animal.  Skull  Skull material is very limited for Marasuchus, with the only preserved bones from this region being a maxilla (a toothed bone at the side of the snout) preserved in PVL 3870 and braincases preserved in PVL 3870 and 3872. The maxilla was low, with at least 12 teeth. Most of these teeth were blade-like and serrated, but some of those near the rear of the bone were less curved and more leaf-shaped. The maxilla also possessed interdental plates on its inner surface. The braincase was tall and fairly typical compared to other early archosaurs. However, in a few cases it shared specific similarities with the braincase of early dinosaurs. For example, the basipterygoid processes (a pair of plates at the bottom of the braincase which connect to the roof of the mouth) were short, blade-like, and tilted forwards. In addition, the exoccipitals (a pair of braincase bones adjacent to the foramen magnum, the main exit for the spinal cord) were wide and edged by a pronounced ridge next to the exit holes for the hypoglossal nerve. Bonaparte (1975) additionally described squamosal and quadrate bones similar to those of Euparkeria attached to PVL 3872's braincase, although these were not mentioned by later studies.  Vertebrae  Almost the entirety of the spinal column is present in Marasuchus, barring the tip of the tail. Most of Marasuchus' diagnostic features (i.e. unique or unusual traits which characterize it specifically) occur in its vertebrae. Most of the neck vertebrae were elongated and had offset front and rear ends, creating a long and curved neck like that of other avemetatarsalians (bird-lineage archosaurs). Also like avemetatarsalians, the upward projecting neural spine of the axis vertebra was expanded and trapezoidal rather than peak-like. More uniquely, the neural spines of vertebrae closer to the base of the neck leaned forwards. Vertebrae near the hip were also characteristic to Marasuchus, since their neural spines were also trapezoidal and expanded to such an extent that they contacted those of adjacent vertebrae. Two vertebrae attach to the hip, less than in most dinosaurs which typically acquire three or more in the sacrum. The tail was characteristically elongated, with vertebrae drastically increasing in length towards the tip. The chevrons (spine-like bones projecting under the tail vertebrae) were also elongated in tail vertebrae near the hip, making the tail unusually deep at its base as well.  Forelimbs  The scapulocoracoid (shoulder blade) was quite large and broad unlike most other avemetatarsalians. On the other hand, the glenoid (shoulder socket) was directed somewhat backwards (rather than sideways), as is the case with other dinosauriforms. The forelimb bones (consisting of a humerus, ulna, and radius) were very slender and shorter than the leg bones, and the forelimb as a whole was about half the size of the hindlimb. No portion of the hand was preserved. The hip of specimen PVL 3870  Hip  The pelvis (hip) shared quite a few similarities with other dinosauriforms not otherwise present in earlier archosauriforms. The ilium (upper blade of the hip) was similar to that of Herrerasaurus in general shape. The pubis (front lower blade of the hip) was longer than the ischium (rear lower blade of the hip), like dinosauriforms. However, the ischium was also enlarged relative to earlier archosauriforms, as it was longer than the main portion of the ilium. Furthermore, the ischium's contact with the pubis is less extensive than in early archosauriforms and it fails to contact the ilium along the boundary of the pubis, as with silesaurids and saurischian dinosaurs. This \\"gap\\" between the ilium and ischium along the edge of the pubis becomes more developed in dinosaurs, where it becomes and open cavity that fills up the entire acetabulum (hip socket). However, this had not yet evolved in Marasuchus, which retains a bony inner wall of the acetablum. Moreover, the edge of the ischium in Marasuchus retains contact between the ilium and pubis, unlike dinosaurs. Nevertheless, a depression present in that area may be a predecessor to the more advanced condition in dinosaurs.  Hindlimbs  Modifications to the acetabulum are mirrored in the head of the femur (thigh bone), which connects to it. A distinct tab of bone known as an anterior trochanter was present on the outer edge of the femoral head, as with other dinosauriforms and to a lesser extent in other avemetatarsalians. In addition, Marasuchus also possessed a ridge of bone known as the trochanteric shelf, which branches down from the anterior trochanter and wraps around the shaft of the femur. A trochanteric shelf is also characteristic of some early dinosaurs, silesaurids, and some specimens of Dromomeron, and a similar structure is also present in aphanosaurs, albeit separate from their equivalent of the anterior trochanter. As with other dinosauriforms, the tibia (shin bone) has a longitudinal groove edged by a sharp flange at its rear outer corner, near the ankle. The tibia was also longer than the femur. The ankle had two main bones: the larger, boxy astragalus and a smaller calcaneum attached to its outer edge. In some aspects, the ankle shared features with other dinosauriforms, such as a vertical triangular branch of the astragalus (known as an ascending process) which rises up in front of the tibia. However, in other aspects the ankle was surprisingly primitive, even compared to earlier avemetatarsalians like pterosaurs and lagerpetids. For example, the rear of the astragalus possesses a vertical groove, and the calcaneum had a knob on its rear edge known as a calcaneal tuber. Unlike lagerpetids or coelophysoids, the astragalus and calcaneum were not fused together. The five metatarsals (foot bones) were thin, elongated, and close together. The third and fourth metatarsals were the longest, followed by the second, with the first and fifth being only about half the length of the longest. Although not all of the pedal phalanges (toe bones) were preserved, the phalangeal formula (number of bones per toe) was likely 2-3-4-5-0 as with other dinosauromorphs.  Classification  Life restoration (without feather-like filaments) compared to human legs. Marasuchus was part of Avemetatarsalia, the branch of archosaurs closer to birds and other dinosaurs rather than to crocodilians. More specifically, it was a dinosauriform, meaning that it was closer to dinosaurs than the lagerpetids. Although it was not as close as silesaurids such as Silesaurus, Marasuchus is still one of the most completely known avemetatarsalians, assisting knowledge of the early evolution of dinosaur-like characteristics.

He was then employed as a translator and interpreter at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Petrashevsky is known to have edited and authored most of the theoretical articles for the Pocket Dictionary of Foreign Words (1846), which popularized democratic and materialist ideas and principles of utopian socialism. Political activism & Petrashevsky Circle In 1844, Petrashevsky's apartment became the venue for social gatherings of intellectuals, which from 1845 took place on a weekly basis. These meetings were later dubbed pyatnitsy (\\"Fridays\\") and those attending them would be known as Petrashevtsy. The latter came to Petrashevsky's house and used his personal library, which contained banned books on materialist philosophy, utopian socialism, and history of revolutionary movements. Among the well-known members of the young intelligentsia who participated in the Petroshevsky Circle was the writer Fyodor Dostoevsky, who belonged to the circle during the 1850s.Figes, p. 133n In late 1848 Mikhail Petrashevsky took part in meetings aimed at creating a secret society. Mock execution and exile Mock execution of Petrashevtsy. Petrashevsky is the man tied to the right-hand pole, without a hood In 1849, Mikhail Petrashevsky was arrested and sentenced to death. Together with the other Petrashevtsy he was taken to the parade ground of the Semionovsky Regiment in Saint Petersburg, the usual place for public executions, and tied to the pole. At the last moment the execution was stopped and it was revealed that his sentence had been commuted to katorga for an unspecified term. He was sent to Eastern Siberia to serve his sentence. In 1856, Petrashevsky's status was changed to that of an exile settler. He lived in Irkutsk, where he founded a newspaper called Amur in 1860. Later life and death In February 1860, Petrashevsky was banished to the Minusinsk district for speaking out against the abuse of power by local officials and he died there six years later. Political work Petrashevsky considered himself a follower of Charles Fourier and spoke for democratisation of the Russian political system and liberation of the peasantry with their lands. He advocated long preparatory work among the masses for revolutionary struggle. As most members of the Russian intelligentsia, their commitment to 'the people' was abstract; being unsure of individual men but loving mankind. Petrashevsky summed this up by proclaiming: 'unable to find anything in either women or men worthy of my adherence, I have turned to devote myself to the service of humanity'.

Radiation-absorbent material, usually known as RAM, is a material which has been specially designed and shaped to absorb incident RF radiation (also known as non-ionising radiation), as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of reflected RF radiation. Many measurements in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing measurement errors and ambiguities. Introduction A large drive-in RF anechoic test chamber. Note the orange caution cones for size reference. Pyramid RAM. The grey paint helps to protect the delicate radiation-absorbent material. One of the most effective types of RAM comprises arrays of pyramid shaped pieces, each of which is constructed from a suitably lossy material. To work effectively, all internal surfaces of the anechoic chamber must be entirely covered with RAM. Sections of RAM may be temporarily removed to install equipment but they must be replaced before performing any tests. To be sufficiently lossy, RAM can be neither a good electrical conductor nor a good electrical insulator as neither type actually absorbs any power. Typically pyramidal RAM will comprise a rubberized foam material impregnated with controlled mixtures of carbon and iron. The length from base to tip of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency and the amount of absorption required. For low frequency damping, this distance is often 24 inches, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3-4 inches. Panels of RAM are typically installed on the walls of an EMC test chamber with the tips pointing inward to the chamber. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by two effects: scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves are picked up by the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. This incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended carbon particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.E Knott, J Shaeffer, M Tulley, Radar Cross Section. pp 528-531\\\\. An alternative type of RAM comprises flat plates of ferrite material, in the form of flat tiles fixed to all interior surfaces of the chamber. This type has a smaller effective frequency range than the pyramidal RAM and is designed to be fixed to good conductive surfaces. It is generally easier to fit and more durable than the pyramidal type RAM but is less effective at higher frequencies. Its performance might however be quite adequate if tests are limited to lower frequencies (ferrite plates have a damping curve that makes them most effective between 30-1000 MHz). There is also a hybrid type, a ferrite in pyramidal shape. Containing the advantages of both technologies, the frequency range can be maximized while the pyramid remains small (10 cm).Fully compact anechoic chamber using the pyramidal ferrite absorber for immunity test Use in stealth technology Radar-absorbent materials are used in stealth technology to disguise a vehicle or structure from radar detection. A material's absorbency at a given frequency of radar wave depends upon its composition. RAM cannot perfectly absorb radar at any frequency, but any given composition does have greater absorbency at some frequencies than others; no one RAM is suited to absorption of all radar frequencies. A common misunderstanding is that RAM makes an object invisible to radar. A radar- absorbent material can significantly reduce an object's radar cross-section in specific radar frequencies, but it does not result in \\"invisibility\\" on any frequency. Bad weather may contribute to deficiencies in stealth capability. History The earliest forms of stealth coating were the materials called Sumpf and Schornsteinfeger, a coating used by the German navy during World War II for the snorkels (or periscopes) of submarines, to lower their reflectivity in the 20 cm radar band the Allies used. The material had a layered structure and was based on graphite particles and other semiconductive materials embedded in a rubber matrix. The material's efficiency was partially reduced by the action of sea water. A related use was planned for the Horten Ho 229 aircraft. The adhesive which bonded plywood sheets in its skin was impregnated with graphite particles which were intended to reduce its visibility to Britain's radar.Shepelev, Andrei and Ottens, Huib. Ho 229 The Spirit of Thuringia: The Horten All-wing jet Fighter. London: Classic Publications, 2007. .Is it stealthy? Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (Retrieved February 2016) Types of radar-absorbent material (RAM)Iron ball paint absorber= Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk utilises iron ball paint One of the most commonly known types of RAM is iron ball paint. It contains tiny spheres coated with carbonyl iron or ferrite. Radar waves induce molecular oscillations from the alternating magnetic field in this paint, which leads to conversion of the radar energy into heat. The heat is then transferred to the aircraft and dissipated. The iron particles in the paint are obtained by decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl and may contain traces of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. One technique used in the F-117A Nighthawk and other such stealth aircraft is to use electrically isolated carbonyl iron balls of specific dimensions suspended in a two-part epoxy paint. Each of these microscopic spheres is coated in silicon dioxide as an insulator through a proprietary process. Then, during the fabrication panel process, while the paint is still liquid, a magnetic field is applied with a specific Gauss strength and at a specific distance to create a magnetic field patterns in the carbonyl iron balls within the liquid paint ferrofluid. The paint then cures [hardens] whilst the magnetic field holds the particles in suspension, locking the balls into their magnetic pattern. Some experimentation has been done applying opposing north-south magnetic fields to opposing sides of the painted panels causing the carbonyl iron particles to align (standing up on end so they are three-dimensionally parallel to the magnetic field). The carbonyl iron ball paint is most effective when the balls are evenly dispersed, electrically isolated, and present a gradient of progressively greater density to the incoming radar waves. A related type of RAM consists of neoprene polymer sheets with ferrite grains or conductive carbon black particles (containing about 0.30% of crystalline graphite by cured weight) embedded in the polymer matrix. The tiles were used on early versions of the F-117A Nighthawk, although more recent models use painted RAM. The painting of the F-117 is done by industrial robots so the paint can be applied consistently in specific layer thicknesses and densities. The plane is covered in tiles \\"glued\\" to the fuselage and the remaining gaps are filled with iron ball \\"glue.\\" The United States Air Force introduced a radar-absorbent paint made from both ferrofluidic and nonmagnetic substances. By reducing the reflection of electromagnetic waves, this material helps to reduce the visibility of RAM- painted aircraft on radar. The Israeli firm Nanoflight has also made a radar- absorbing paint that uses nanoparticles.http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-07/stealth-paint- turns-any-aircraft-radar-evading-stealth-plane The Republic of China (Taiwan)'s military has also successfully developed radar-absorbing paint which is currently used on Taiwanese stealth warships and the Taiwanese-built stealth jet fighter which is currently in development in response to the development of stealth technology by their rival, the mainland People's Republic of China which is known to have displayed both stealth warships and planes to the public.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/07/05/2003507440http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Taiwan_to_build_stealth_warship_fleet_999.html =Foam absorber= Foam absorber is used as lining of anechoic chambers for electromagnetic radiation measurements. This material typically consists of a fireproofed urethane foam loaded with conductive carbon black [carbonyl iron spherical particles, and/or crystalline graphite particles] in mixtures between 0.05% and 0.1% (by weight in finished product), and cut into square pyramids with dimensions set specific to the wavelengths of interest. Further improvements can be made when the conductive particulates are layered in a density gradient, so the tip of the pyramid has the lowest percentage of particles and the base contains the highest density of particles. This presents a \\"soft\\" impedance change to incoming radar waves and further reduces reflection (echo). The length from base to tip, and width of the base of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency when a wide-band absorber is sought. For low-frequency damping in military applications, this distance is often 24 in, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3‚Äì4 in. An example of a high-frequency application would be the police radar (speed-measuring radar K and Ka band), the pyramids would have a dimension around 4 in long and a 2 x 2-in base. That pyramid would set on a 2 x 2-in cubical base that is 1in high (total height of pyramid and base of about 5 in). The four edges of the pyramid are softly sweeping arcs giving the pyramid a slightly \\"bloated\\" look. This arc provides some additional scatter and prevents any sharp edge from creating a coherent reflection. Panels of RAM are installed with the tips of the pyramids pointing toward the radar source. These pyramids may also be hidden behind an outer nearly radar-transparent shell where aerodynamics are required. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves may be reflected back to the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. A good example of coherent reflection is in the faceted shape of the F-117A stealth aircraft which presents angles to the radar source such that coherent waves are reflected away from the point of origin (usually the detection source). Incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended conductive particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.E Knott, J Shaeffer, M Tulley, Radar Cross Section. pp 528-531. Other foam absorbers are available in flat sheets, using an increasing gradient of carbon loadings in different layers. Absorption within the foam material occurs when radar energy is converted to heat in the conductive particle. Therefore, in applications where high radar energies are involved, cooling fans are used to exhaust the heat generated. =Jaumann absorber= A Jaumann absorber or Jaumann layer is a radar- absorbent substance. When first introduced in 1943, the Jaumann layer consisted of two equally spaced reflective surfaces and a conductive ground plane. One can think of it as a generalized, multilayered Salisbury screen, as the principles are similar. Being a resonant absorber (i.e. it uses wave interfering to cancel the reflected wave), the Jaumann layer is dependent upon the Œª/4 spacing between the first reflective surface and the ground plane and between the two reflective surfaces (a total of Œª/4 + Œª/4 ). Because the wave can resonate at two frequencies, the Jaumann layer produces two absorption maxima across a band of wavelengths (if using the two layers configuration). These absorbers must have all of the layers parallel to each other and the ground plane that they conceal. More elaborate Jaumann absorbers use series of dielectric surfaces that separate conductive sheets. The conductivity of those sheets increases with proximity to the ground plane. =Split-ring resonator absorber= Split-ring resonators (SRRs) in various test configurations have been shown to be extremely effective as radar absorbers. SRR technology can be used in conjunction with the technologies above to provide a cumulative absorption effect. SRR technology is particularly effective when used on faceted shapes that have perfectly flat surfaces that present no direct reflections back to the radar source (such as the F-117A). This technology uses photographic process to create a resist layer on a thin (about 0.007 in) copper foil on a dielectric backing (thin circuit board material) etched into tuned resonator arrays, each individual resonator being in a \\"C\\" shape (or other shape‚Äîsuch as a square). Each SRR is electrically isolated and all dimensions are carefully specified to optimize absorption at a specific radar wavelength. Not being a closed loop \\"O\\", the opening in the \\"C\\" presents a gap of specific dimension which acts as a capacitor. At 35 GHz, the diameter of the \\"C\\" is near 5 mm. The resonator can be tuned to specific wavelengths and multiple SRRs can be stacked with insulating layers of specific thicknesses between them to provide a wide-band absorption of radar energy. When stacked, the smaller SRRs (high-frequency) in the range face the radar source first (like a stack of donuts that get progressively larger as one moves away from the radar source) stacks of three have been shown to be effective in providing wide-band attenuation. SRR technology acts very much in the same way that antireflective coatings operate at optical wavelengths. SRR technology provides the most effective radar attenuation of any technologies known previously and is one step closer to reaching complete invisibility (total stealth, \\"cloaking\\"). Work is also progressing in visual wavelengths, as well as infrared wavelengths (LIDAR-absorbing materials). = Carbon nanotube = Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by multi- wall nanotubes (MWNTs). Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller radar cross-section. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the University of Michigan regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as stealth technology on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current stealth aircraft black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.Bourzac, Katherine. \\"Nano Paint Could Make Airplanes Invisible to Radar.\\" Technology Review.

The game was originally being developed as a sequel to Pariah, but since Pariah was a commercial flop, Warpath continued development as a whole new game. However, the similarities between the gameplay of both games are very apparent. Technology The game utilizes Unreal Engine 2 with optimizations and additions of the 2.5 Build (the same used for Unreal Championship 2 and Pariah) and the Havok physics engine.http://www.playwarpath.com/ Official Site Demo A demo for the PC version of Warpath was released on March 1, 2006. The demo included two maps: Breach for Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, and Rush for Capture The Flag. The Front Line Assault mode was not included. This demo is available on the disc included with April 2006 issue of PC Gamer. A demo for the Xbox version of Warpath is available on the disc included with the June 2006 issue of Official Xbox Magazine. It was basically the same as the PC demo, though the Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch map that was included was SubZero instead of Breach. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was delayed multiple times from its original March 21, 2006, release date, and started to get better reactions from the press during its development, but it still continued to get mixed reviews. People who played the game or demo thought it was a top-notch fast-paced shooter. In the words of IGN: \\"While WarPath doesn't do anything blatantly wrong, it fails to do anything new. Charging through the repetitive metallic halls of each level will feel very familiar to anyone who's played a lot of first person shooters. Even the bots on the hardest difficult suffer from noticeable A.I. issues, so if this one's to be played at all it should be online. After numerous hours of play some weapon balance issues will become apparent, especially with the Vibro Blade during close range battles. Vehicles are included, but they're generally useless as the stages are so small. A larger variety of game modes more interesting maps would have helped out, but ultimately WarPath does little too differentiate itself from the rest of the shooters out there. The upgradeable weapons are a good feature, but nothing that'll hold players' interest beyond a few hours.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official site (dead link) * Category:2006 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"Warpath (video game)"},{"id":"4148036","text":"Linda Jackson may refer to: * Linda Jackson (cyclist) (born 1958), Canadian professional cyclist * Linda Jackson (designer) (born 1950), Australian fashion designer, fashion retailer and artist * Linda Jackson (politician), former mayor of Vaughan, Ontario (2006‚Äì2010) * Linda Jackson (businesswoman), CEO of French car manufacturer Citro√´n ","title":"Linda Jackson"},{"id":"4148070","text":"Pal Zileri is an Italian luxury brand specialized in both formal and casual menswear.

It is the successor of the Canon EOS 20D, and is succeeded by the EOS 40D. It can accept EF and EF-S lenses, and like its predecessor, it uses an APS-C sized image sensor, so it does not require the larger imaging circle necessary for 35 mm film and 'full-frame' digital cameras. Improvements Back of the Canon EOS 30D camera Changes over the 20D include a bigger LCD rear screen, improved shutter mechanism rated for 100,000 actuations, improved frame capacity, 1/3 stop increments for sensor speed and an added spot meter. This unit retains the same sensor as its predecessor; all lenses still have an angle of view crop of 1.6. Other changes include a larger 11 frame RAW / 30 frame JPEG buffer, and slightly faster 0.15 second startup. The maximum frame rate is the same (5 frame/s), but a lower-speed 3 frame/s option has been added. The 30D uses the same number of autofocus points as the 20D (nine), but has improved algorithms. The 30D's file numbering system holds 9,999 images to one folder, which was introduced with the 5D. The EOS 30D can also accept the Canon Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E1/E1A for fast file transfer to a remote file server, either through an ethernet cable or a Wi-Fi network. This capability expands the EOS 30D's range of applications to sports and studio set ups where real-time transfer of the images is crucial. Resolution The Canon EOS 30D has several resolution settings: * Raw CR2 format (3504 x 2336) * Large/Fine (3504 x 2336) * Large/Normal (3504 x 2336) * Middle/Fine (2544 x 1696) * Middle/Normal (2544 x 1696) * Small/Fine (1728 x 1152) * Small/Normal (1728 x 1152) * (There are also six resolution settings for JPEG+Raw which are the same as the first six but which also attach a Raw file in a separate .cr2 file). Features The Canon EOS 30D features a Mode Dial on the top which selects the shooting mode. It is divided into two sections: Creative Zone and Basic Zone. The Creative zone provides manual and semi-manual modes; it gives access to RAW format, manual exposure, aperture and ISO sensitivity. Creative Zone * A-DEP: The camera automatically selects the aperture and shutter speed to keep most of the image in focus. (Only recommended in high light conditions as the camera tends to choose smaller f/stops) * M (Manual): The camera lets you choose manually the aperture and shutter speed. * Av (Aperture priority): The camera lets the user choose the aperture (f/) value and then automatically adjusts the shutter speed for correct exposure. * Tv (Shutter speed priority): The camera lets the user set the shutter speed and automatically sets the aperture for correct exposure. * P (Program AE): The camera automatically chooses an aperture and shutter combination for correct exposure and the user can change between one of these combinations. Basic Zone * Auto (represented with a green rectangle): Completely automatic shooting. * Portrait: The camera attempts to create a more shallow depth of field to create more striking portraits. * Landscape: For shooting landscapes and sunsets. * Close-Up: For shooting small objects near to the camera. * Sports: For capturing fast moving objects. * Night Scene: Shoots with flash and with slow shutter so that the subject is illuminated by the flash and the background (e.g. a city) is also captured naturally in the night. * No Flash: All automatic with no flash. The camera features (like many others) two LCDs, one monochrome at the top, which contains all information pertinent to shooting, and a full-color one at the back, which is used for picture reviewing and menu navigation. The rear display has a resolution of 320 √ó 240 pixel (76,800 pixels).Canon counts the sub-pixels of each pixel, i.e. the red, green, and blue channel of each pixel, and therefore specifies the rear display to have 76,800 √ó 3 = 230,400 or ca. 230,000 dots. The Canon EOS 30D also features a large dial on its back which is used for fast scrolling over the stored pictures or over the settings in the menu. The JUMP button can also be used to reach sections of the menu easily, as well as scroll through either 10 or 100 image in playback mode. The 8 way controller above the dial is used to select one of the 9 AF points, to move around a zoomed image in playback mode, and to set custom white balance.

He lived in Dublin, where he was a licensed vintner, maintaining a premises in the notorious Monto area. He was involved in the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916. This led to him having legal difficulties over the licence of his public house. Shanahan consulted the lawyer and politician Timothy Healy who commented: - :\\"I had with me to-day a solicitor with his client, a Dublin publican named Phil Shanahan, whose licence is being opposed, and whose house was closed by the military because he was in Jacob's during Easter week. I was astonished at the type of man - about 40 years of age, jolly and respectable. He said he \\"rose out\\" to have a \\"crack at the English\\" and seemed not at all concerned at the question of success or failure. He was a Tipperary hurler in the old days. For such a man to join the Rebellion and sacrifice the splendid trade he enjoyed makes one think there are disinterested Nationalists to be found. I thought a publican was the last man in the world to join a rising! Alfred Byrne, M.P., was with him, and is bitter against the Party. I think I can save Shanahan's property.\\" He was elected for Dublin Harbour at the 1918 general election, defeating Alfie Byrne. Like other Sinn F√©in MPs he did not take his seat at Westminster, but became a member of the revolutionary D√°il. He represented Dublin Harbour in the First D√°il 1919 to 1921. He was arrested and detained in custody by the British government in April 1920 but was released in time to attend the next meeting of the D√°il on 29 June 1920. In 1921 a general election was held for the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. Republicans used this as an election for the Second D√°il. Shanahan was elected unopposed for the four member Dublin Mid constituency. He was defeated at the 1922 general election to the Third D√°il, as a member of the Anti-Treaty faction of Sinn F√©in (which opposed the creation of the Irish Free State in the place of the Republic declared in 1919). He left Dublin in 1928 and returned to his home town of Hollyford, County Tipperary. He died on 21 November 1931, aged 57.

The mission of the Gallery is the protection and presentation of the collection and documentation of the art scene and artistic life in the region of Eastern Slovakia. Commission Today the Gallery houses over 7,000 works of art. Apart from a representative collection of nineteenth and twentieth century art from the region of Eastern Slovakia, the collection also provides an overview of modern and contemporary Slovak art. In addition to its extensive exhibition activities the Gallery also focuses on research and exploration of art scene in Eastern Slovakia, and especially of Ko≈°ice modernism, the phenomenon associated with the 1920s characterised by the unusual development of modern art. In its vast premises, the Gallery presents a wide range of Slovak and international art. The accompanying activities such as guided tours, children¬¥s workshops or lectures and Library with professional art literature offer great possibilities of spending leisure time directly at the gallery premises. Fire The day 12 January 1985 wrote the history of the East Slovak Gallery as an unfortunate event. On that day an extensive fire broke out in its storerooms and destructive flames suddenly transformed hundreds of works of art into cinders and ruin. The fire was caused by leak from a damaged street gas pipe. The fire irreversibly destroyed 1030 works of art. The former County House / Hlavn√° 27 Since 1992 the Gallery has a seat in the building of the former County House. The building in a Baroque and Classicist style, designed by a Vienna-based builder, J. Langer, was completed in 1779. In the period of 1888-1889 the building underwent several alterations: the front part of the house was adjusted, courtly wings were added and the rear wing was modified. On the facade one can see the coat of arms of the Aba√∫j-Torna County of 1558. Upstairs, there is the assembly hall, the so-called historic hall, with illusive arcades showing the coat of arms of former Aba√∫j-Torna County as well as some of its towns and villages. It was here that the first cabinet meeting of the National Front of Czechs and Slovaks was held on April 5, 1945, which proclaimed the Ko≈°ice government programme. EHMK 2013 As part of the European Capital of Culture, a section of the gallery was rebuilt in 2013 and a new underground exhibition space was created to serve primarily for the presentation of contemporary art.

This stereotype is closely connected with a common trope in New Zealand fiction, the man alone. The stereotype draws on images of high country farmers and hunters, particularly from areas such as Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin, who work large sheep stations, often employing the horse and dog rather than mechanised transport, due to the terrain they have to cover.

The collection, published in 2005, explores various aspects of race and culture, both in the United States and abroad. The first essay, the book's namesake, traces the origins of the \\"Ghetto\\" African American culture to the culture of Scotch-Irish Americans in the Antebellum South. The second essay, \\"Are Jews Generic?\\", discusses middleman minorities; while \\"The Real History of Slavery\\" discusses the timeline of abolition of slavery and serfdom. The last three essays discuss the history of Germany, African-American education, and criticism of multiculturalism. Essays=Black Rednecks and White Liberals The title essay states Sowell's thesis about the origins of the \\"black ghetto\\" culture. Sowell argues that the black ghetto culture originates in the dysfunctional white southern redneck culture which was prominent in the antebellum South. This culture came, in turn, from the \\"Cracker culture\\" of \\"North Britons\\", that is, border English, highland Scots, Welsh, and Ulstermen who emigrated from the more lawless border regions of Britain in the eighteenth century. Are Jews Generic? In the collection's second essay, Sowell explores the origins of antisemitism among those harboring jealousy toward Jews for their financial and entrepreneurial successes. Among other historically persecuted \\"middlemen minorities\\" were Lebanese and Chinese immigrant merchants. The resentment is due to a perceived \\"lack of added value\\" that these middlemen provide, as it is not easily observable. The Real History of Slavery In the collection's third essay, Sowell reviews the history of slavery. Contrary to popular impression, which blames Western society and white people as the culprits, Sowell argues that slavery was a universal institution accepted and embraced by nearly all human societies. The world's trade in slaves, then slavery itself, was forcibly abolished by the British in the nineteenth century, against opposition in Africa and Asia where it was considered normal. The economic effects of slavery are also misunderstood, since slaves were often a luxury item whose upkeep was a drain on the rich, and nowhere did the availability of cheap slave labour result in wealthy societies. Germans and History The fourth essay features Sowell's argument that Germany should not be defined solely by the 12-year period of Adolf Hitler's r√©gime from 1933‚Äì45. Sowell further argues that Hitler was highly inconsistent in his views toward a unified Germany - while he strenuously argued for annexation of the German-dominated Sudetenland, German-dominated portions of Italy such as Tyrol were ignored as Hitler preferred his alliance with Benito Mussolini. Black Education: Achievements, Myths, and Tragedies The fifth essay features Sowell's discussion of the early days of Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. and its eventual deterioration from its place of prominence in early Black education, which Sowell argues was a direct consequence of the famed Brown v. Board of Education United States Supreme Court decision. Additionally Sowell argues that, though W. E. B. Du Bois was more activist in his attempts to end Jim Crow laws and other forms of legal discrimination while Booker T. Washington held a more accommodating position, Washington did at times secretly fund and support efforts to end Jim Crow laws. History Versus Visions The final essay features Sowell's criticism of the advantages that multiculturalism is supposed to confer to the society in which it is present. ReferencesExternal links * .

The disadvantage of mobile positioning today is relatively low preciseness, the boom in the generation of phones with a GPS will raise positioning accuracy.

He was the third son of King Frederick I of Denmark and his second wife, Sophie of Pomerania. King Frederick I had his son educated by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. He spent four years at the Landgrave's castle in Kassel. In 1544, Adolf, his brother Johann, and their half-brother King Christian III of Denmark, divided the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The areas were divided according to approximately equal tax proceeds. Adolf, as the youngest, was entitled the first choice. Since he selected the part with the castle Gottorp, the line of the house Oldenburg created by him was called Schleswig- Holstein-Gottorp. Partition of Holstein and Schleswig Until the Treaty of Speyer, concluded on 23 May 1544, Adolf's half-brother Christian III of Denmark ruled the entire Duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in the name of the then still minor Adolf and his brother John the Elder (Hans den √Üldre). They determined their youngest brother Frederick was to have a career as Lutheran administrator. In 1551 Frederick became administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim. In 1544, following negotiations between the elder three brothers and the nobility of the duchies, the brothers decided to partition the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig between themselves. The revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to each of the elder brothers. Other general revenues, such as taxes from towns and customs duties, were levied together and then shared among the brothers. The secular rule in the fiscally divided duchies was shared between the brothers. As dukes of Holstein and Schleswig the three brothers bore the formal title of \\"Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Ditmarsh and Stormarn\\". Adolf founded a cadet branch of the royal Danish House of Oldenburg called the House of Holstein-Gottorp. John the Elder, the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev, produced no issue, so no branch emerged from his side. After his death in 1580, Adolf and his nephew Frederick II of Denmark halved John's share among themselves.Cf. Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen, \\"Die d√§nischen K√∂nige als Herz√∂ge von Schleswig und Holstein\\", Frauke Witte and Marion Hartwig (trls.), in: Die F√ºrsten des Landes: Herz√∂ge und Grafen von Schleswig, Holstein und Lauenburg [De slevigske hertuger; German], Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen (ed.) on behalf of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schleswig-Holsteinische Geschichte, Neum√ºnster: Wachholtz, 2008, pp. 73-109, here pp. 87seq. Adolf travelled, entrusting Johan Rantzau to manage his country. Adolf participated in the Diet of Augsburg where he witnessed Emperor Charles V at the high point of his power. In 1553 Adolf returned to his homeland. In 1556 Adolf succeeded his younger brother Frederick as Bishop of Schleswig. Family and children On 17 December 1564 he married Christine, daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and had the following children: # Frederick II (21 April 1568 - 15 June 1587). # Sophia (1 June 1569 - 14 November 1634), married on 17 February 1588 to John VII of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. # Philip (10 August 1570 - 18 October 1590). # Christina (13 April 1573 - 8 December 1625), married on 27 August 1592 to King Charles IX of Sweden. # Elisabeth (11 March 1574 ‚Äì 13 January 1587) # John Adolph (27 February 1575 - 31 March 1616), prince-bishop of Bremen, L√ºbeck, later duke of Holstein and duke of Schleswig. # Anna (27 February 1575 - 24 April 1625), married 28 January 1598 to Count Enno III of Ostfriesland. # Christian (29 May 1576 ‚Äì 22 April 1577) # Agnes (20 December 1578 - 1627). # John Frederick (1 September 1579 - 3 September 1634), prince-bishop of Bremen, L√ºbeck and Verden. In fiction Duke Adolf is a character in Stefan Heym's 1981 book Ahasver (published in English as The Wandering Jew). Heym's depiction of the Duke is highly satyrical and unflattering. The Duke is shown in the midst of a night of lechery and drunkenness, charging Paul von Eitzen, Superintendent of the Lutheran church of the Gottorp share of Holstein and Schleswig, with creating \\"The Kingdom of God\\" in his duchy ‚Äî i.e., imposing the newly minted Lutheran orthodoxy and persecuting \\"heretics\\" such as the Mennonites. At the same time the Duke, out of political expediency, also sends troops to help the efforts of the zealously Catholic Philip II of Spain to stamp out the Dutch Revolt conducted by the Duke's fellow Protestants.

It stands for rationalism and humanism. It is the initiator of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations. History Kerala rationalist movement is a continuation of Sri Narayana Movement. Sahodaran Ayyappan a favorite disciple of Sri Narayana Guru, changed the Guru‚Äôs slogan Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Human-beings) to Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu (No Caste, No Religion, No God for Human-beings). Ayyappan organized the Sahodara Sangham (The Brotherhood Association), and started two magazines ‚ÄúSahodaran‚Äù and ‚ÄúYukthivadi‚Äù. In August 1931 M. C. Joseph became Yukthivadi's sole editor- publisher and shifted the publication to Irinjalakkuda. In 1935 a Yukthivadi Sangham was registered at Cochin M. C. Joseph as secretary and Panampilly Govinda Menon as treasurer. M. C. Joseph managed Yukthivadi magazine without any interruption For forty five years until June 1974. The vibrant rationalist movement that is seen in Kerala today is undoubtedly the direct consequence of the ideas spread by Yukthivadi for more than half a century. The existing Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham (KYS) was formed at Kozikode in 1969 May Adv. M. Prabha as president and P.S. Raman Kutty as Secretary. Yukthi Darsanam is the philosophical text of KYS. Many militant rationalists like MBK, Joseph Edamaruku, P.V. Velayudhan Pilla, U.Kalanadhan, Pavanan, Johnson Eyeroor, Padmanabhan Pallath, Gangan Azikode, Rajagopal Vakathanam, Dhanuvachapuram Sukumaran, Sabhari Girish, Adv. Anil Kumar etc. had led the KYS in different times. The periods of Abraham Kovoor and Basava Premanand is known as the golden eras of Rationalism. The Janayugam Varika, a Weekly owned by Communist Party of India by the chief editorship of Kambisseri Karunakaran, propagated their articles and rationalism in large scale. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, Yukthirekha in Malayalam and a quarterly The Secular Humanist in English. The well-known rationalist Pavanan was founder and editor of Yukithirekha and was president of the organization for several years. Other presidents have included U. Kalanathan. Like many rationalist organizations in India they conduct demonstrations to expose god men as frauds. They also support those who defy fundamentalist taboos and support inter-caste marriages. They have also been involved in public debate over school textbooks. The organization claims over 3,000 members across Kerala.

He was born in Paris in 1587 and later became the first Superior of the Jesuit Missions amongst the Huron in Canada. His letter to his brother, dated 1 August 1626, inaugurated the series Relations des J√©suites de la Nouvelle-France about the missionary work in the North American colonies of New France.  Biography  Born in Paris to an official of the criminal court, Lalemant entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Rouen on 29 July 1607. Following this period, he studied philosophy at the Jesuit college in La Fl√®che (1609‚Äì12). For the subsequent formation period of his regency, he taught the lower classes at the college in Nevers (1612‚Äì15), then studied theology at La Fl√®che (1615‚Äì19). After this, his spent his period of tertianship, a third probationary year, in Paris (1619‚Äì20). He then served as a teacher of logic and physics at the college in Bourges (1620‚Äì22), and from October 1622 to March 1625 was principal of the boarding school at the Coll√®ge de Clermont. Lalement was made responsible for setting up a mission of the Society of Jesus in New France, and in April 1625 he left Dieppe with Fathers √ânemond Mass√© and Jean de Br√©beuf, accompanied by two lay brothers. He arrived in Quebec City in June. Neither the directors of the Compagnie de Montmorency nor the settlers, among whom the pamphlet Anti-Coton was then circulating, had any liking for the Jesuits. But the Recollets received them with great kindliness and gave them hospitality until they could have their own house. Lalemant was quick to realize that the progress of the colony was being impeded by the very people who ought to have promoted it, the de Ca√´ns, who were interested exclusively in the fur trade. A change was imperative. Therefore, as soon as Jesuit Father Philibert Noyrot arrived in 1626 he was ordered, because of the good standing that he enjoyed at the court, to take ship again for France, with the object of advancing the welfare of the colony. One result of this move was the revocation of the Edict of Nantes so far as New France was concerned. Noyrot had arranged for supplies to be sent to his colleagues in Quebec City, but they never reached their destination. According to Father Chrestien Le Clercq, they were seized at Honfleur by Raymond de La Ralde and Guillaume de Ca√´n. Thwarted by the Trading Company at Quebec in his efforts to evangelize the Indians, Lallemant sailed to France in order to lodge a protest. Attempting to return to New France, his vessel was captured by Kirke who was then blockading the Saint Lawrence River. Lallemant and Father Francis Ragueneau S.J. were sent as prisoners to England but subsequently released at the request of Queen Henrietta Maria.Campbell, T.J., Pioneer priests of North America, 1642-1710, Vol. 2, Fordham University Press, 1910, p. 257 A second attempt in 1629 to travel to Canada resulted in shipwreck off Cape Canso, and on his way back to France he was wrecked a second time on the coast of Spain. Back in France, he was made rector of the College at Eu. He finally reached New France in 1632, after Quebec was restored to the French.Campbell, Thomas. \\"Charles Lalemant.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 Jun. 2014 Lallemant returned again to France in 1638, where he became procurator of the Canadian missions, Vice Provincial Superior of the French Province of the Society and superior of the Jesuit house in Paris. He obtained the concession of the Island of Montreal for the colony of Dauversi√®re, and he also recruited Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance to engage in the undertaking. When there was question of appointing the first Bishop of Quebec, his candidacy was urged. Lallemant was the author of a spiritual work entitled La vie cach√©e de Notre Seigneur J√©sus-Christ. He is not to be confused with Louis Lallemant, author of Les Conferences Spirituelles. Lallemant had two close relatives in the Jesuit missions: J√©r√¥me Lalemant, his brother, and Gabriel Lalemant, a nephew, who was murdered by the Iroquois and is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church.

It was promoted as the smallest and lightest 3G phone available. It has been succeeded by the K530.  Features  The K610 is a successor to the Sony Ericsson K600i. Its features include a fixed-focus 2 megapixel digital camera with 2.5√ó digital zoom (zoom only available when set to the VGA quality setting), Bluetooth v2.0 and support of Sony's new proprietary memory card format, Memory Stick Micro (M2). It has a slightly bigger 1.9 inch, 262,000 colour, 176√ó220 pixel TFT LCD screen, built- in email client, WAP and HTML browser and a D-pad for navigation. The K610i also supports many music formats including MP3/AAC/M4A/WMA.  Design  *The K610 is a small candybar style phone which is comparable in size to the K750, which is only 2 mm shorter, 0.8 mm wider and 3.6 mm thicker. It features larger and more ergonomic buttons than the K600/K608. Comparing the phone to current 3G phones available these days, it seems that the K610 is far smaller and slimmer than even some recent 2G phones. *Navigation is provided by the central D-pad which is used for navigation of menus. The two soft keys provide greater flexibility whilst navigating and the popular activity button and web browser buttons are still included in the minimalist design. *The camera is located on the reverse side of the phone and in accordance to Sony Ericsson's dual front design philosophy, common to most Sony Ericsson camera phones, the phone is held in a horizontal position when taking pictures. In this position, a small button on the right bottom side of the phone functions as the shutter release.

Both share a similar design different to that of the original K610i yet have identical features, the only difference being a 2g mass difference and the ability to 'Photoblog' on the V630. The V630 is specifically aimed at Vodafone users, with case branding, simlocking and a red oriented interface with unique Vodafone icons, similar to that across the range of Vodafone branded phones.  Reviews  Although being relatively small for a phone with its features, the K610 was criticized for not including several common features found in other contemporary mobile phones, namely its lack of an FM radio, IrDA, and LED lights for taking pictures in low lighting conditions, as well as its sub- par photo quality. Modding Since K610i and W660i have relatively similar hardware specifications and a similar mainboard, soft modifications are available to convert a K610i to a W660i by using flashing software and the firmware files of the W660i model.http://myforum.lasyk.net/showthread.php?t=38528 Such modified phone will be able to use the Walkman feature which is available to W series phones only however will be unable to use the radio function of the Walkman phone due to the lack of radio tuner in the original K610i.

Playing career=Early years (1987‚Äì1990) McGuane showed great promise for his local club Sebastopol in the Ballarat Football League. He made his senior debut for the club in 1985 while still a teenager and was a member of the side that lost heavily in the Grand Final to North Ballarat. Ignored by , who had the Ballarat region in their recruiting zone, were quick to pounce, and signed McGuane to their Under 19s squad for the 1986. McGuane made his senior debut 1987 with and showed great skills as a running midfielder. In 1988 he finished second to Peter Daicos in the Copeland Trophy count. In 1990 he was one of five Magpies - others being captain Tony Shaw, Scott Russell, Graham Wright and Darren Millane - to accumulate over 500 disposals over the season. He was one of Collingwood's best players in their drought-breaking Grand Final victory over , acquiring 22 disposals and kicking a goal. Copeland Trophy era (1991‚Äì1994) McGuane won consecutive Copeland Trophies in 1992 and 1993, and also won All-Australian selection in 1992. His career was at its peak and he was regarded among the elite in AFL Football, and part of his hard work was due to Darren Millane's trainer, who was asked by Mick to help his fitness. In 1994 he kicked an amazing running goal against Carlton at the MCG, which saw him run from the centre-square along the wing and half-forward flank, closing to 30m and kicking it through the middle. He bounced the ball 7 times during the famous run, and was deemed as one of the greatest goals of all-time. Later career and injuries (1995‚Äì1997) McGuane's final years as a player were blighted by injury and exacerbated by ongoing alcohol and gambling problems; in 1991 he had lost his driving licence for 19 months after he was caught drink-driving. Calf injuries were his main concern in 1995, where he played only 13 games. In 1996 he had a life- threatening bladder infection, and resulted in a ruptured urethra. The injury came upon a kick to the groin in the annual ANZAC Day clash against Essendon. At the end of all seasons from 1992‚Äì1997, McGuane experienced some kind of surgery. In 1996 he left Collingwood for a fresh start, and was traded to Carlton for a 1st and 4th round draft selections in the 1996 AFL Draft. Coach Tony Shaw of Collingwood did offer McGuane a two-year contract deal, but was refused. He had calf problems at Carlton, causing him only to manage a disappointing 3 games with the rival club. His off-field incidents were also frequent, and included another alcohol problem, as well as a fight with Carlton teammate Matthew Hogg at training.Decade of Woes: 1990‚Äì1999 McGuane then returned to Collingwood and worked in the club's marketing department. Coaching career In 2000, McGuane took up his first coaching appointment with Tasmanian club Burnie. In 2001, he led them through an undefeated season, culminating in a premiership. McGuane then returned to Victoria to coach Gisborne in the Bendigo Football League for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons. In 2002 all three teams he coached (Under 18s, Reserves and Seniors) won their Grand Final. The seniors won again in 2003. In 2005, McGuane was appointed a part-time scout at by coach Terry Wallace, but jumped to the following year after securing a full-time coaching appointment under Grant Thomas. After Thomas was sacked at the end of the season, McGuane decided to quit. McGuane then coached the Balwyn Tigers seniors team in the Eastern Football League Division 1 in 2007. He came to the club at a tough time as they move into the highly rated EFL competition 1st Division. McGuane's coaching saw Balwyn into the finals in their first year in the competition. In 2008, McGuane was appointed as senior coach of the Keilor Football Club. In his inaugural season, he led the club's Essendon District Football League A Grade side to a grand final victory, followed by premierships in 2016 and 2019.

As TIME commented in 1995: \\"Grachev had remarked recently that only an 'incompetent commander' would order tanks into the streets of central Grozny, where they would be vulnerable (...) Yet at the end of December he did it.\\"Why It All Went So Very Wrong, TIME, 16 January 1995. Eventually, in July 1996, following his re-election, Yeltsin sacked the disgraced Grachev. The First Chechen War soon ended with more than 100,000 soldiers and civilians having lost their lives. In December 1997, Grachev was appointed a senior military adviser to Rosvooruzhenie State Corporation, the Russian arms export monopoly. On 25 April 2007, Grachev was fired from this position. –≠–∫—Å-–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –ì—Ä–∞—á–µ–≤, —É–≤–æ–ª–µ–Ω —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è —Å –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –≥–µ–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ ¬´–†–æ—Å–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ç–∫—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞¬ª, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –æ–Ω –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ö 10-—Ç–∏ –ª–µ—Ç., Ekho Moskvy, 25.04.2007. Grachev died on 23 September 2012 of acute meningoencephalitis, in the Vishnevsky Military Hospital in Krasnogorsk. He was 64. Corruption accusations Grachev was accused of being personally involved in major military corruption scandals, which was not proven in court, that occurred during the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from East Germany. The alleged corruption, which gained Grachev the nickname of \\"Pasha Mercedes\\", was the focus of a series of articles published by the investigative journalist Dmitry Kholodov. Four of Grachev's airborne officers and two others were tried in the murder of Kholodov but were later acquitted. Popular culture The archival footage of Grachev saying \\"tank regiments are commanded by total idiots; you send in the infantry first, then the tanks\\" is shown on TV in the 2002 film House of Fools.

Early life Pandro Berman was born to a Jewish familyThe Jewish Chronicle: \\"Revealed: the truth about the 'Jewish' Hollywood\\" by Michael Freedland September 5, 2015 in Pittsburgh in 1905. His father Henry Berman was general manager of Universal Pictures during Hollywood's formative years. Career Pandro was an assistant director during the 1920s under Mal St. Clair and Ralph Ince. In 1930, Berman was hired as a film editor at RKO Radio Pictures, then became an assistant producer. When RKO supervising producer William LeBaron walked out during production of the ill-fated The Gay Diplomat (1931), Berman took over LeBaron's responsibilities, remaining in the post until 1939. After David O. Selznick became chief of production at RKO in October 1931, Berman managed to survive Selznick's general firing of most of the staff. Selznick named Berman producer for the adaptation of Fannie Hurst's short story Night Bell, a tale of a Jewish doctor's rise out of the Lower East Side ghetto to the height of becoming a Park Avenue physician, which Selznick personally retitled Symphony of Six Million. He ordered Berman to have references to ethnic life in the Jewish ghetto restored. The movie was a box-office and critical success. Both Selznick and Berman were proud of the picture, with Berman later saying it was the \\"first good movie\\" he had produced. The Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musicals were in production during the Berman regime, Katharine Hepburn rose to prominence, and such RKO classics as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Gunga Din (both 1939) were completed. MGM Upset when an RKO power-play diminished his authority, Berman left for MGM in 1940, where he oversaw such productions as Ziegfeld Girl (1941), National Velvet (1944), The Bribe (1949), Father of the Bride (1950), Blackboard Jungle (1955) and BUtterfield 8 (1960). He survived several executive shake-ups at MGM and remained there until 1963, then went into independent production, closing out his career with the unsuccessful Move (1970). Awards Berman was the winner of the 1976 Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. Six of his films were nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture: The Gay Divorcee (1934), Alice Adams and Top Hat (both 1935), Stage Door (1937), Father of the Bride (1950), and Ivanhoe (1952).  Personal Life and death  In 1937, Berman and his wife, Viola, hired architect Roland Coate to design a house for them in Beverly Hills, California. The sixteen-room, Cape Cod-inspired mansion cost $50,000 to build and included a screening room. Berman had three children with his first wife Viola - Susan Berman Moshay, Cynthia Berman Schaffel, and Michael Berman. His marriage to Viola ended in divorce. In 1960, Berman married Kathryn Hereford. Berman died of congestive heart failure on July 13, 1996 in his Beverly Hills home, aged 91. He was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park, Culver City, California.

In his younger years Du Toit did much to promote the Afrikaans language as a symbol of Afrikaner nationalism. Apart from the years 1882-8 when he was Superintendent of Education in the South African Republic, he lived in or near the town of Paarl in the Cape Colony. Disillusionment with the Kruger regime led him, in later years, to moderate his views. He was instrumental in initiating the translation of the Bible into Afrikaans and was a proponent of the Afrikaans language. He died an outcast. Early years He was born in 1847 near Paarl in the Cape Colony at Plaas Kleinbos, a farm that had been in the family's possession since their arrival in the Cape as Hugenot refugees in 1688. He was educated at Paarl Gimnasium and studied theology at the Theological Seminary at Stellenbosch, completing his studies in 1872 and was ordained as a minister in the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) (NGK) the same year. Theologically his view were much influenced by the Abraham Kuyper the Dutch Neo-Calvinist thinker. This made many congregations reluctant to invite him to be their minister. In 1875, he became the minister of a new congregation based close to the family farm - that of North Paarl, a post that he held until 1881. Promoting the Afrikaans language The first copy of Die Afrikaanse Patriot At the time, the better- educated Dutch settlers in the Cape Colony regarded the Afrikaans language as a patois that was used by the less-educated. Du Toit however regarded the Afrikaans language as a symbol of Afrikaner Nationalism. In the early 1870s two Dutch schoolteachers, Arnoldus Pannevis and C.P. Hoogenhout made a number of pleas in De Zuid-Afrikaan newspaper that, for the benefit of the Cape Coloured community and also for the lesser-educated Afrikaner community, the Bible should be translated into Afrikaans. In 1874, Pannevis addressed his concerns to the British and Foreign Bible Society while Du Toit's articles in De Zuid-Afrikaan added support to Pannevis and Hoogenhout. On 14 August 1875, Hoogenhout, Du Toit and others established the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of True Afrikaners) which has as its objectives the promotion of the Afrikaans language, nation and country. Initially this was to be achieved by the publication of a monthly journal and as soon as was possible, a dictionary and grammatical rules (spraakkuns). Du Toit was elected president of the association and within a year had compiled a set of grammatical rules. In 1876, he launched the first Afrikaans language newspaper Die Afrikaanse Patriot. Initially the paper, a monthly publication, had 50 subscribers, in its second year of publication 400 and by 1881 3000 subscribers, having in 1877 become a weekly publication. Although Du Toit could not openly control Die Afrikaanse Patriot without the consent of his church council, he was the driving force behind the paper, while his brother D.F. du Toit (known as Oom Lokomotief) was officially the paper's editor. The British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 caused considerable anger among the Dutch community in all of Southern Africa. Die Afrikaanse Patriot published a scathing attack and Du Toit proposed a boycott of British goods and services, and in October 1880 Die Patriot argued that the time had come for decisive action---many Transvaal leaders state that this was the trigger for the start of the First Boer War which led, in 1881, to the Transvaal regaining its independence. In 1879, Du Toit proposed the formation of the Afrikaner Bond, an anti-British organisation in which all Afrikaners could feel at home. Die Patriot urged a boycott of British products. Jan Hofmeyr, who had founded the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging (South African Farmers' Protection Association) as a vehicle of protest against a proposed excise duty on wine agreed to merge the two organisations and by skilful manoeuvring gained control of the merged organization. Later years Stephanus Jacobus du Toit as one of the delegates to the London Convention in 1883-84. In 1882, after the Transvaal (now the South African Republic) regained its independence, its president Paul Kruger invited Du Toit to become Superintendent of Education, a post that he held until 1889. He assisted in drawing up the Republic‚Äôs education law of 1882 which embodied Christian national principles. While he was secretary of state both the number of schools and the number of children attending school increased substantially. In 1883‚Äì4, he was part of Kruger‚Äôs delegation to Europe and helped negotiate the London Convention. In 1875, while in the Transvaal, he was appointed official translator of the Bible by the GRA, a task for which he received official encouragement from the government of the South African Republic. He resigned in 1888 due to a personality clash with Willem Johannes Leyds, a newly appointed advisor to Kruger. After his resignation, he returned to the Cape Colony and publicly took over the post of editor of Die Patriot, breaking with his brother and other members of the Afrikaner Bond. He was personally bankrupt, having lost money in speculation while in the Transvaal. Under his editorship Die Patriot adopted a much more conciliatory stance towards the British Government, possibly as a result of financial backing he received from Cecil Rhodes, though this is disputed. He continued his translation of the Bible into Afrikaans, following the principals of translation laid down by the Synod of Dordrecht requiring the use of the original Hebrew or Greek where appropriate. He succeeded in translating the Book of Genesis, the Psalms, the Songs of Solomon, Book of Joshua, the Gospel according to Matthew, the Gospel according to Mark, the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation. Du Toit's translation program was not well received‚Äîneither the synod of the NGK in Orange Free State in 1885 nor the synod of the NGK in the South African Republic in 1886 supported Du Toit's efforts. By 1890 the Eerste Taalbeweging (first language movement) was all but dead. His son Jakob Dani√´l du Toit, known by the pen name Totius, a member of the Tweede Taalbeweging (second language movement), completed the translation in 1933 with assistance from his own son Stephanus du Toit (1905‚Äì1982). The Jameson Raid of 1896 caused the Afrikaner Bond to break with Rhodes. Du Toit broke with the Afrikaner Bond and through Die Afrikaanse Patriot backed Rhodes both in the Jameson Raid and in the Second Anglo-Boer War. He stood for the Cape Parliament in 1898 but failed to get elected. In 1904, following financial problems DF du Toit & Co, the company that owned Die Afrikaanse Patriot was sold and the paper was succeeded by the Paarl Post. Du Toit died on 25 May 1911 as a result of injuries sustained in August the previous year when the cart in which he was travelling overturned while he was journeying to Calvinia to visit one of his congregations. Legacy Du Toit was a prolific writer-- the anonymous author of the epitaph on his tombstone described him as \\"The father of the Afrikaans language\\", though this honour has also be given to Pannevis, to Hoogenhout or to all three. His contributions to Afrikaans literature included: * 1876 - Erste Beginsels van die Afrikaanse Taal [Fundamentals of the Afrikaans language] (A joint work of which Du Toit was the main contributor). *1877 - (With Hoogenhout and Malherbe) Die Geskiedenis van ons Land in die Taal van ons Volk [The history of our country and the language of our people]. * 1889 - Die Bybel in Afrikaans [The Bible in Afrikaans] (A brochure with a translation of the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis). * 1893 - Genesis (translation of the Book of Genesis) * 1895 - Mattheus (translation of the Gospel according to St Mathew) * 1898 - Openbaring (translation of the Book of Revelation) * 1902 - Patriot woordeboek: Afrikaans-Engels [Patriot dictionary: Afrikaans-English] * 1907 - Die Psalms (translation of the Psalms) Sources *This Day in South African History *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica  References  Category:Afrikaner people Category:South African politicians Category:White South African people Category:Translators of the Bible into Afrikaans Category:Afrikaner nationalists Category:1847 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Cape Colony people Category:South African journalists Category:19th- century South African politicians ","title":"Stephanus Jacobus du Toit"},{"id":"4148410","text":"High rise buildings of Landalabergen in Landala.

Anthroponymy is a branch of onomastics. Researchers in the field of anthroponymy are called anthroponymists. Since the study of anthroponyms is also relevant for several other disciplines within social sciences and humanities, experts from those disciplines also take part in anthroponymic studies, including researchers from the fields of anthropology, history, human geography, sociology, prosopography, and genealogy. Anthroponymy of individual and family names Name of pharaoh Ramesses III, written in hieroglyphs Anthroponymy of individual and family names, and their mutual correlations, includes the study of: Anthroponyms of individuals can also be classified according to gender. Names of human males are called andronyms (from Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ / man, and ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± / name), while names of human females are called gynonyms (from Ancient Greek Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ / woman, and ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± / name). Anthroponymy of group and population names Anthroponymy of group and population names includes the study of demonyms (names of localized populations), ethnonyms (names of ethnic groups), as well as tribal names and clan names. Related terms and processes There are several specific terms and processes related to anthroponymy, like: * anthroponymization, a process when an anthroponym is formed from an apellative, like when a surname is created from the name of ones occupation, thus forming an occupational surname. Such surnames are common in most languages, including English: Smith (from smith), Miller (from miller), Thatcher (forom thatcher), Shepherd (from shepherd), or Potter (from potter). * deanthroponymization, a process when an anthroponym becomes an apellative, like when the surname of the inventor Louis Braille was used to create a name for the writing system for the visually impaired persons (braille). * transonymization of anthroponyms into toponyms, a process when a human proper name is used to form a toponym (proper name of a locality; place name), thus creating an anthropotoponym, like when the name of Alexander the Great was used to create several astionyms (city names), including name for the newly created city of Alexandria in the ancient Hellenistic Egypt, or when the surname of Christopher Columbus was used to create several choronyms (region names), including names for Southamerican state of Colombia, and Canadian province of British Columbia. * transonymization of toponyms into anthroponyms, a process when toponyms (place names) are used to form human names (anthroponyms), thus creating various topoanthroponyms.Gary Lefman (2013): Internationalisation of People Names Many surnames are created in that way, and they are known as toponymic surnames. Most demonyms (names for localized populations) are topoanthroponyms by formation, since they are usually created from toponyms, and also some ethnonyms are topoanthroponyms too (those that are formed from toponyms, and thus referred to as topoethnonyms). For example, geographic designations for the region of Black Mountain (Montenegro) and frontier region of Ukraina (Ukraine) were used to create not only demonyms for general populations for those regions, but also ethnonyms for modern ethnic Montenegrins and ethnic Ukrainians.

The company is well known for serving flame-grilled burgers made from 100% pure beef and handmade chips. Other menu items include chicken burgers, ribs as well as ice cream and milkshakes. History The history of the company revolves around the Halamandaris family, whose family members are still part of the executive team today, with extensive experience in the food and franchising industries. Steers founder, George Halamandress had a vision to create a successful family run business and the idea for Steers originated while he was on holiday in the United States where he came across innovative food industry concepts and ideas. He decided to bring these new food industry methods to South Africa, which was the starting point for the creation of a brand that would grow from strength to strength. Uncle George, as he was affectionately known, created the original Milky Lane ice cream parlours, followed in quick succession by the first South African steakhouse (the Rosebank Golden Spur), the Seven Steers steakhouse in Highlands North and the Black Steer in Yeoville in the early 1960s. He was also one of the first entrepreneurs to bring the franchising concept to South Africa. After Uncle George died in 1984, leadership of the chain passed to his nephews Peter, Theo, and their brother, Perry, as well as to Uncle George's youngest son, John. The three brothers had all been operating their own franchises and John was operating the manufacturing business, supplying Steers outlets and other retailers. Together, they re-engineered the brand and actively sought new franchisees. The early 1980s saw the opening of Steers in Sandton City, which attracted interest from would-be franchisees, and this encouraged the team behind Steers to launch their franchise programme. There seemed to be no shortage of prospective franchisees wanting to buy into their franchise model, and more than 15 Steers outlets had opened within two years, with this number growing to 250 stores 10 years later. By the end of the 1990s, Steers started expanding beyond South Africa, and outlets opened in Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. The name Steers evolved over the years too, starting with Golden Spur, then changing to Seven Steer, followed by Branded Steer and Longhorn Steer, before becoming Steers. Steers Holdings listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 1994, and in 2001 changed its name to Famous Brands Limited. This reflected the diversity of the Famous Brands group portfolio, although Steers remained the icon brand within the group. The brand has continued to prosper and currently has over 600 Steers restaurants worldwide. By attracting new consumers as well as increasing the consumption frequency of existing customers, Steers succeeded in reaching their target of double-digit system-wide sales growth in 2012. In the late 80s the Comitis family, who owned the Steers rights in the Western Cape, continued to grow the brand throughout southern Africa. After decades of growth Steers became the most prominent fast food company in southern Africa and the Comitis family sold their shares back to the Famous Brands parent company. Franchise In 1983, Steers launched a new franchise programmer. The owners placed a single advertisement in a local newspaper inviting franchisees to apply, and since then Steers has never had a shortage of prospective franchisees seeking to buy into the franchise. Within two years there were more than 15 outlets opened, and this number grew to 250 stores ten years later. By the end of the 90s Steers started expanding beyond South Africa‚Äôs borders, with outlets in Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. There are over 500 franchises across Africa. A Steers restaurant opened on Lavender Hill, Battersea, London, UK in late July 2013. Achievements For 17 years in a row, Steers has been recognized by well-known Johannesburg listing magazine, Leisure Options, for serving the Best Hamburger in the QSR industry. Steers has also won ‚Äòbest chips‚Äô for 13 years running. Steers Holdings Limited was, later renamed Famous Brands Limited.

Early life and career Darnell was born in The Bronx in 1950. His mother was from South Carolina with Caribbean and Italian parents and his father from Savannah, Georgia. As an adult, Thom Browder began going by his two middle names, August Darnell. Claims in some sources that he was born in Montr√©al in Canada, are erroneous; according to Darnell they stem from the fictitious back-story behind the Kid Creole character. Growing up in the melting pot of the Bronx, Darnell was exposed early on to all kinds of music. Darnell began his musical career in a band named The In-Laws with his half-brother, Stony Browder Jr., in 1965. The band disbanded so Darnell could pursue a career as an English teacher. He taught at Alverta B. Gray Schultz Middle School in Hempstead, New York after studying English and drama at Hofstra University. He later claimed that he established a musical career because he was a \\"frustrated actor\\". In 1974, again with Stony Browder, he formed Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, becoming its lyricist and bass player. The band combined swing and Latin music with disco rhythms and had its biggest hit in 1976 with \\"Cherchez La Femme\\". Their self-titled debut release was a Top 40-charting album which was certified gold and was nominated for a Grammy. Kid Creole In 1979, Darnell left Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band. He joined the band Machine, and co-wrote their best known song \\"There But for the Grace of God Go I\\". He also began producing for other artists, such as Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band and Gichy Dan's Beachwood No.9, before adopting the name Kid Creole (adapted from the Elvis Presley film King Creole) in 1980. Darnell described the persona of Kid Creole as \\"a flamboyant, devil- may-care bon vivant\\". With his band and backing singers (including Darnell's then-wife, Adriana Kaegi), collectively known as Kid Creole and the Coconuts, he established an exuberant musical style drawing on such influences as big bands, notably that of Cab Calloway, salsa, jazz, pop music and disco. Darnell wrote the lyrics, which \\"satirised the high life at a time when America was ravaged by recession\\". The group released three albums, Off the Coast of Me (1980), Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places (1981) and Tropical Gangsters (1982), that became especially popular and successful in Europe. Darnell also worked as a producer with acts on ZE Records. However, the band was much less successful in the U.S., and was eventually dropped by Sony. Later life Darnell moved to England in the 1980s, and later lived in Denmark, Sweden, and Maui, and still occasionally tours Kid Creole and the Coconuts with his European band. Darnell's daughter Savanna appeared on Love Island 2018. In 2019 Darnell married his girlfriend of 10 years, Eva Tudor-Jones in Maui. Eva has been a big part of the band's empire for 23 years, starting off a Mama Coconut to now managing the band. Darnell and Eva share a daughter, born in Maui.

Smith was the eighth of nine children and labored on his parents' modest homestead throughout an impecunious childhood. After high school, he worked as a ranch- hand in Oklahoma, then built roads and constructed telephone systems in Arizona. During this period Smith sent money home to help his parents with the mortgage on their land, but even the aggregate of the family's funds proved insufficient to avoid foreclosure.Buck, Robert T., Leon Polk Smith Foundation: Biography, (2006) Retrieved 2020-3-20 After the foreclosure, and released from the burden of familial financial support, Smith enrolled at Oklahoma State College (now East Central University), in Ada, Oklahoma, with the intention of becoming a teacher. Following graduation, he moved to New York City (1936), where he attended the Columbia University Teacher's School. Mr. Smith's artistic development was set in motion during his first semester at Columbia, when one of his teachers took him to see the Gallatin Collection, then at New York University. The sight of paintings by Mondrian and sculpture by Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Jean Arp was a formative experience.Smith, Roberta, Leon Polk Smith, 91, Artist Loyal to Geometry, Is Dead. (1996).

In the decade that followed, Smith moved through preliminary explorations of neo-plasticism and began to paint in a more hard-edge style, typified by geometric lines, curving shapes of color, and the use of tondo (disk-shaped) canvases.

It marked Jeremy Renner's film debut. Plot At Fairmount High School, Ohio in the suburbs of Dayton, a group of teenage students begin their school with an assembly featuring a band called \\"High on Life\\", though they are selfish at teachers and the principal. As the band continues to play onstage, Mark \\"Dags\\" D'Agastino and Reggie Barry decide to sabotage the assembly by having a track played and exposing the band lip syncing their music as it ends drastically but upbeat. After a typing class, the seniors cut school and throw a party for Principal Moss. Moss eventually gets informed about the party from the school body president Steve Nisser. When he returns home, he gives the group detention, forcing them to write a letter to the President of the United States, explaining what is wrong with the education system. The next day while arriving at school, Moss and the new typing class teacher notices that various newspaper station vans are there assuming that something has gone wrong within the building. Mrs. Winston tells him that Jason Lerman is inside the building after meeting the seniors. Moss makes the announcement over them being invited by the President, who amazingly enjoyed their letter, to Washington, D.C. to discuss it. However, it is actually just a plot devised by the corrupt U.S. Senator to humiliate the President. The bus arrives at a convenience store, where Dags and Reggie lock Moss in a flooded washroom, and they steal alcoholic beverages. They are pursued by Travis, a crazed Star Trek fan and crossing guard, who hitches a ride with an Asian family. While on their way, Moss falls into a \\"coma\\" after taking pills given to him by bus driver Red. At this point, the students go on a rampage celebrating over Moss passing out and throw another party, while Carla Morgan, the school slut, puts makeup on Moss. The next day, the bus is pursued by Travis and the police. Red apparently dies from a drug overdose, and the bus nearly plows into a lake. Dags manages to stop it in time, but the car lands on the water and Travis escapes. Arriving at Washington, the group checks into a hotel and decides to take a class photo at a cemetery. Miosky uses fart lighting on J. Edgar Hoover's flame to distract Travis. That night, the seniors secretly lace a box of chocolates with tequila and give it to Miss Milford. When Milford seduces Moss, the students begin to leave to go to a party at the hotel next door, but Steve Nisser threatens to blow the whistle. Dags orders Mioski to take care of him. At the hotel, Lisa Perkins discovers the plot to use the students and embarrass the President. The next day, Senator Lerman unexpectedly wakes up Moss and Milford, who‚Äîshocked at finding themselves in the same room‚Äîprepare themselves and the seniors for their meeting with the President. However, when they open the room, they do not find them there but only a tied-up Steve Nisser. Moss and Milford find the missing students, as they are informed of Lerman's plot as Lerman baffles to the discovery. The senator subsequently kidnaps Miosky and takes him to the White House with the others in hot pursuit. When they arrive at the White House, the senator insults the seniors, but Moss unexpectedly stands up for them. The senator's plot is ultimately exposed and the seniors return home. The film ends with a montage of the characters and where they ended up after the events.

Landscape with Birds showing a dodo in the lower right, by Roelant Savery, 1628 George Edwards, who later gave it to the British Museum Roelant Savery (or Roeland(t) Maertensz Saverij, or de Savery, or many variants; 1576 ‚Äì buried 25 February 1639) was a Flanders-born Dutch Golden Age painter. Life Savery was born in Kortrijk. Like so many other artists, he belonged to an Anabaptist family that fled north from the Spanish-occupied Southern Netherlands when Roelant was about 4 years old and settled in Haarlem around 1585. He was taught painting by his older brother Jacob Savery (c. 1565 ‚Äì 1603) and Hans Bol. After his schooling, Savery traveled to Prague around 1604, where he became court painter of the Emperors Rudolf II (1552‚Äì1612) and Mathias (1557‚Äì1619), who had made their court a center of mannerist art. Between 1606 and 1608 he traveled to Tyrol to study plants. Gillis d'Hondecoeter became his pupil. Before 1616 Savery moved back to Amsterdam, and lived in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. In 1618 he settled in Utrecht, where he joined the artist's guild a year later. His nephew Hans would become his most important assistant. In 1621 Savery bought a large house on the Boterstraat in Utrecht. The house had a large garden with flowers and plants, where a number of fellow painters, like Adam Willaerts were frequent visitors. Savery had kept his house in Amsterdam, and had one child baptized in Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam).Stadsarchief Amsterdam Savery was friends with still life painters like Balthasar van der Ast and Ambrosius Bosschaert. In the 1620s he was one of the most successful painters in Utrecht, but later his life got troubled, perhaps because of heavy drinking. Though he would have pupils until the late 1630s, amongst which Allaert van Everdingen and Roelant Roghman, he went bankrupt in 1638 and died in Utrecht half a year later. Works Still life (130x80cm, 1624). The largest painting he ever made, with 44 different species of animals and 63 species of flowers. Savery primarily painted landscapes in the Flemish tradition of Gillis van Coninxloo, often embellished with many meticulously painted animals and plants, regularly with a mythological or biblical theme as background. He also painted multiple flower still lifes; bouquets in stone niches, sometimes with lizards such as Flowers with Two Lizards, insects or fallen petals and regarded as his best work.W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 928. His unique style of painting, related to the then reigning Mannerism, has been highly popular with collectors and can be found in many museums in Europe and North America. His preparatory drawings are also valued highly. Among his best-known works are several depictions of the now-extinct dodo painted between 1611 and 1628.http://julianhume.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2010/07/History-of-the-dodo-Hume.pdf His nephew Hans a.k.a. Jan Savery was also known for his paintings of the dodo (including a famous 1651 illustration currently held at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History), which he probably copied from his uncle's work. Savery's dodos Savery is famous for being the most prolific and influential illustrator of the extinct dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards' Dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. This and his other images are the source for many other dodo illustrations.

They started as a trio in the late 1970s before becoming a quartet, and was originally known as the Salt of the Earth. \\"Asin\\" means salt in Filipino language. History=Formation and early success ASIN was formed in late 1976, the nucleus of which was the duo of Mike Pillora Jr. of Negros Occidental and Cesar Ba√±ares Jr. of South Cotabato, who were playing at folk joints and pub houses in Manila as 'Mike and Cesar'. A year later, Lolita Carbon was recruited by the duo to fill in the missing middle voice and eventually became the third member. Pillora named the trio 'Salt of the Earth' after the song recorded originally by The Rolling Stones and later by Joan Baez, written and composed by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Other than the song title, Pillora also based the name of the group from the Biblical metaphor salt of the earth which represents the humble and sincere masses. In 1978, the trio (who were all songwriters, composers and arrangers) signed their first recording contract and localized their name 'Salt of the Earth' into 'Asin ng Lupa'. They ultimately became known simply as ASIN. The members also adopted handles (sobriquets) for themselves based on local style nicknames and they became known to their fans as Nonoy, Saro and Nene. In the same year, their eponymous debut LP \\"Asin\\" was released, giving birth to an alternative form of music which was different and distinct from what was mainstream. Their songs conveyed a message that roused a social-awareness among the vast majority of Filipinos becoming a rallying call for social and political aspirations. In the last quarter of 1979, they launched another album called Himig ng Pag-ibig (\\"Hymn of Love\\"). The group's break-up abruptly followed. However, their absence from the music scene did not hamper their growing popularity. The group was not heard from until 1983. In the summer of the same year, AIESEC (Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales), a students‚Äô business organization based in the island of Cebu, made a project to reunite the group. Nonoy was summoned and was tasked to reunite his band. This resulted in a jam-packed reunion concert of the group at Cebu Coliseum, Cebu City. From that time on, ASIN, with their manager Dindo, rolled into a series of performances in Mindanao, sporadic shows in the Visayan Region, and marathon concerts in Luzon. This culminated in the creation and launch of their third album Himig ng Lahi (\\"Hymn of the Race\\") in the same year. Through Nonoy, Fred Aban Jr., the session bass player known by the name Pendong, was adopted by the trio and became the fourth member of the group although he had not been a songwriter (\\"Mga Limot na Bayani\\", \\"Siglo\\", \\"Pag-asa\\", among others were written by Pendong Aban Jr.). Since everybody in the group was a \\"junior\\" (each one was carrying their father's first name), Nene also proclaimed herself a \\"junior\\". In early 1984, the group released an experimental album called Ang mga Awitin ng Bayan kong Pilipinas, an adaptation of traditional and contemporary songs from various regions of the Philippine archipelago. In November 1985, they came out with another original compilation that Nonoy called ASIN...Sa Atubiling Panahon (\\"Asin...In A Doubtful Time\\"). This was unfolded by the roll of events that happened in the beginning of the following year, among which was the EDSA Revolution that toppled the ruling Marcos regime. ASIN called it \\"atubiling panahon\\" (doubtful time) and the group split for a second time. In 1988, they decided to regroup again hoping to come up with new material to make another album that would speak of the time. Instead they were urged by their new manager into making an adaptation of outdated songs and came out with a double album called Himig Kayumanggi and Sinta. Later on, various intrigues led to the expulsion of Nonoy. The disgruntled Nonoy went to Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Greece, Israel and Egypt to \\"look for his soul\\". Back home, the dream of making a new album was not fulfilled. Soon after, Saro and Nene, together with the name (ASIN), joined the band known as Lokal Brown. In 1990, the remaining members of Asin (who were under the leadership of a clique headed by their new manager) disbanded. Saro went back to his home province of South Cotabato, Nene formed 'Nene Band', and Pendong formed 'Grupong Pendong'. In 1992, a concert promoter gathered the three original members, Nonoy, Saro and Nene for a reunion concert. Pendong, according to the promoter, was not included because of issues with scheduling. The concert was staged at the Folk Arts Theater. However, it was nothing more than a one night gig and each member went back again to their ways after the concert. Death of Ba√±ares At around 9:00 p.m. on March 18, 1993, Ba√±ares was at a karaoke bar in his hometown of Koronadal when a brawl erupted among several customers. A single gunshot was fired which hit Ba√±ares on the forehead. He was brought to the hospital but eventually died. After a seven-year trial, lawyer Gualberto Catalu√±a Jr. and brothers Joelito and Joel Castracion were found guilty for the murder of Ba√±ares and were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were also ordered to pay Ba√±ares' family more than ‚Ç±1 million in damages. According to the prosecution's witnesses, Catalu√±a and the Castracion brothers assaulted Ba√±ares over a misunderstanding. Catalu√±a allegedly started the fight by throwing a beer bottle at Ba√±ares forehead. While the Castracion brothers were assaulting Ba√±ares, Catalu√±a passed a handgun to Joelito Castracion who then shot Ba√±ares. The three served their sentences at New Bilibid Prison. However, on June 1, 2007, Catalu√±a was released after a successful appeal that downgraded his conviction from murder to homicide. The court considered his sentence served after spending 7 years in detention and another 7 years incarcerated. Catalu√±a later resumed his law practice. Later years Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nene or Asin as she is known among her fans in Cagayan province up north, frequented her friend Willi Catral for some gigs. Her frequent visit to Tuguegarao has help her establish contacts with environment groups like the Sierra Madre Outdoor Club. In 2000, Craig Burrows, MBE, originally from England but a long term resident of the Philippines, came up with the idea to bring together the remaining members of the group and make an album. He first spoke with Nonoy who eagerly agreed and later brought Nene and Pendong to Nonoy's island residence. The three had a few meetings wherein Nonoy came up with the concept for the album which the two eagerly accepted. However, the album was not released. Nonoy's concept was never realized, but in 2002, with the support of Burrows, Nene and Pendong made the album Pag- ibig, Pagbabago, Pagpapatuloy. Later, Pendong shared his stories with the media, of how Nonoy had finally decided to put down his guitar and settle into a peaceful life; and of the band's beginnings, of how together with Nonoy and Saro, he met Nene at a folk rock club called Kola House and then decided to form their own musical group, naming it 'Salt of the Earth'. This he claimed was the beginning of the group ASIN. Nonoy continued to perform with a new partner named Ginji, known together as 'Noyginji Interaktiv'. They distributed CDs with new compositions, such as \\"...Ang Karugtong\\" (\\"...The Continuation\\"). In mid-2006, Nene and Pendong parted ways. Pendong and his family emigrated to USA where he continued playing as Grupong Pendong. During the last quarter of the same year, Nonoy and his family moved to Israel and continued to perform as Noyginji Interaktiv. Nene stayed in the Philippines and played as a soloist. On July 14, 2010, Nonoy and Nene reunited as ASIN to pay tribute to their fallen colleague Saro Ba√±ares Jr. in Koronadal, South Cotabato. Their performance marked the opening of the 44th T‚Äônalak Festival, a yearly celebration showcasing dances and crafts of the tribal communities as well as the produce of South Cotabato. The following day, they were invited by Manny Pacquiao to play in his home province Saranggani before a large crowd. On the third day, they casually played for invited guests of the mayor of Lake Sebu in Surallah, South Cotabato. Legacy of Asin Asin was the first group to incorporate Filipino indigenous instruments into pop/rock music. They also studied Filipino tribal music and did what they could to be true to the origins of the music. Instead of plagiarizing the indigenous music, they set about educating people about respecting the origins of the music and representing it with agreement from the tribal sources. Although Asin admittedly did not set out to be a political band, their songs most of which have themes of loneliness and longing, reflected the tumultuous undercurrent of the seventies in the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos. Sometimes their recordings were deemed subversive and confiscated, while other times they were considered patriotic and the band is occasionally invited to play at the Presidential Palace.

References to Asin in popular culture=\\"Balita\\" The Tagalog lyrics of The Black Eyed Peas' \\"The Apl Song\\" is based on \\"Balita\\" (Tagalog for News), one of Asin's songs. This song depicts the tragedies that are happening in the conflicts in Mindanao. The final chorus of the song is a mixture of Hiligaynon in the first two lines, and Cebuano in the last two lines, translated from the Tagalog chorus of the song. \\"The Apl Song\\" tells about the hardships of Allan Pineda, member of the Black Eyed Peas, that he experienced during his childhood in Angeles City, Pampanga. He chose \\"Balita\\" because he grew up listening to Asin. His next song from the album Monkey Business, entitled \\"Bebot\\", sampled the guitar riff of \\"Ang Bayan Kong Sinilangan (Cotabato)\\", another song by Asin. \\"Balita\\" is also sampled on the sixth track of Gloc-9's 2009 album Matrikula, which features Gabby Alipe of Urbandub. \\"Masdan Mo ang Kapaligiran\\" This song was in dedication to the Pasig River. It was used as the closing credits for the movie Engkanto starring Janice de Belen, Roderick Paulate, Vilma Santos and the Francis Magalona, the movie was released in 1993 by OctoArts Films. \\"Himig Ng Pag- Ibig\\" In 2010, Yeng Constantino covered the song as the theme for the ABS- CBN TV series Dyosa, arranged by Paolo Zarate. The original version was sampled by hiphop artist Pio featuring Lolita Carbon, released by Viva Records in 2012. The song was also covered by actress Glaiza de Castro for the Cinemalaya film Liway (2018). This has also been a cover soundtrack for the film \\"Adan\\" starring Cindy Miranda and Rhen Esca√±o.

However, his works include other genres as well. He writes in Punjabi, Urdu and Persian languages. His poetry is known for the unique use of everyday, commonplace phrases and wording that is instantly relatable for masses in the region. Numerous of his Punjabi lines and phrases have actually become a figure of speech in everyday conversations. The most prominent feature of his expression is the poignancy buried deep under the humor making his poetry one of its kind. The nuance of tragedy in his poems is a reflection of social injustice, discriminations and personal misfortunes of his characters. This is why he, himself commented: ‚ÄúReal laughter is one that sheds tears when squeezed‚Äù. Early life and education Anwar Masood & Siddiqa Anwar Anwar Masood was born in 1935 in Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan. He received his elementary education in Gujrat and Lahore, Pakistan. His father Muhammad Azeem moved to Lahore a few years before partition in 1947. After his elementary education in Gujrat and Lahore, he attended Watan High School on Brandreth Road, Lahore. Just before partition, the family moved back to Gujrat. It was here in the Public High School, Gujrat that Masood took his matriculation examination and passed his Secondary School Examination with distinction in 1952. Conceding to the parents‚Äô will to become a doctor, he took admission in FSc. Pre-Medical in Zamindaar College, Gujrat. However, science was not his area of interest. So two years later, he again started his FA and earned a scholarship. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958, with distinction, topping the college and earning a scholarship and winning a spot on the Roll of Honor list. His subjects in BA were History, Urdu Literature, Persian and English. Due to domestic problems, he could not start his master's degree program right away and started teaching at Government Islamia High School in Kunjah, Punjab. He finally finished his master's degree from the Oriental College, Punjab University in 1961. In fact, he became a Gold Medalist in MA Persian and topped in Punjab University, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. He retired from the teaching profession in 1996. Anwar Masood married his former classmate Qudrat Ilahi Siddiqa in 1965. His wife also taught Persian at Government College, 6th Road Rawalpindi. Together they have 5 children; 3 sons and 2 daughters: Muhammad Aqib, Muhammad Ammar Masood, Muhammad Jawad Azfar, Adeela Rashid and Leenah Hashir.

The New Republic Party, successor to the United Party, won only 10 seats, all but one of them in Natal Province. Once again, the Herstigte Nasionale Party failed to win any seats. In the 1977 elections, the National Party received its best-ever result with support of 65% of the vote and (after a by-election) 135 seats in parliament out of 165. Vorster, however resigned as Prime Minister for alleged health reasons on 28 September 1978. Background On 11 February 1975 four liberal MPs led by Harry Schwarz broke away from the United Party and created the Reform Party. The party merged with the Progressive Party on 25 July 1975 to form the Progressive Reform Party. In 1977 another group of United Party members left the party to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party. This proved to realign the opposition in Parliament, as the PFP became the official opposition party.

Generally, a tensile stress, either externally applied or internally present, is needed to induce embrittlement. Exceptions to this rule have been observed, as in the case of aluminium in the presence of liquid gallium.J. Huntington, Inst. Metals, 11 (1914), 108 This phenomenon has been studied since the beginning of the 20th century. Many of its phenomenological characteristics are known and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain it.B. Joseph, M. Picat, and F. Barbier, Eur. Phys. J. AP, 5 (1999), 19D.G. Kolman, \\"Environmentally Induced Cracking, Liquid Metal Embrittlement\\" in \\"ASM Handbook, Volume 13A, Corrosion: Fundamentals, Testing and Protection\\", ASM International, Materials Park, OH, pp. 381-392 (2003). The practical significance of liquid metal embrittlement is revealed by the observation that several steels experience ductility losses and cracking during hot-dip galvanizing or during subsequent fabrication.M. H. Kamdar, Treatise on Material Science and Technology, Academic Press, Vol. 25 (1983), 361 Cracking can occur catastrophically and very high crack growth rates have been measured.D.G. Kolman and R. Chavarria, Journal of Testing and Evaluation, 30, (2002) 452. Similar metal embrittlement effects can be observed even in the solid state, when one of the metals is brought close to its melting point; e.g. cadmium-coated parts operating at high temperature. This phenomenon is known as solid metal embrittlement.D.G. Kolman, \\"Environmentally Induced Cracking, Solid Metal Embrittlement\\" in \\"ASM Handbook, Volume 13A, Corrosion: Fundamentals, Testing and Protection\\", ASM International, Materials Park, OH, pp. 393-397 (2003).  Characteristics= Mechanical behavior Liquid metal embrittlement is characterized by the reduction in the threshold stress intensity, true fracture stress or in the strain to fracture when tested in the presence of liquid metals as compared to that obtained in tests. The reduction in fracture strain is generally temperature dependent and a ‚Äúductility trough‚Äù is observed as the test temperature is decreased. A ductile-to-brittle transition behaviour is also exhibited by many metal couples. The shape of the elastic region of the stress-strain curve is not altered, but the plastic region may be changed during LME. Very high crack propagation rates, varying from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second are induced in solid metals by the embrittling liquid metals. An incubation period and a slow pre-critical crack propagation stage generally precede final fracture.  Metal chemistry It is believed that there is specificity in the solid-liquid metals combinations experiencing LME.Liquid metal assisted cracking of galvanized steel work, Topic Paper, SC / T / 04 / 02, Standing Committee on Structural Safety, London, U. K. June 2004, website: www.scoss.org.uk There should be limited mutual solubilities for the metal couple to cause embrittlement. Excess solubility makes sharp crack propagation difficult, but no solubility condition prevents wetting of the solid surfaces by liquid metal and prevents LME. Presence of an oxide layer on the solid metal surface also prevents good contact between the two metals and stops LME. The chemical compositions of the solid and liquid metals affect the severity of embrittlement. Addition of third elements to the liquid metal may increase or decrease the embrittlement and alters the temperature region over which embrittlement is seen. Metal combinations which form intermetallic compounds do not cause LME. There are a wide variety of LME couples. Most technologically important are the LME of aluminum and steel alloys.  Metallurgy  Alloying of the solid metal alters its LME. Some alloying elements may increase the severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element is known to be segregation to grain boundaries of the solid metal and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the solid metal. The hardness and deformation behaviour of the solid metal affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.  Physico-chemical properties  The interfacial energy between the solid and liquid metals and the grain boundary energy of the solid metal greatly influence LME. These energies depend upon the chemical compositions of the metal couple.  Test parameters External parameters like temperature, strain rate, stress and time of exposure to the liquid metal prior to testing affect LME. Temperature produces a ductility trough and a ductile to brittle transition behaviour in the solid metal. The temperature range of the trough as well as the transition temperature are altered by the composition of the liquid and solid metals, the structure of the solid metal and other experimental parameters. The lower limit of the ductility trough generally coincides with the melting point of the liquid metal. The upper limit is strain rate sensitive. Temperature also affects the kinetics of LME. An increase in strain rate increases the upper limit temperature as well as the crack propagation rate. In most metal couples LME does not occur below a threshold stress level. Testing typically involves tensile specimens but more sophisticated testing using fracture mechanics specimens is also performed.Kamdar, M. H., Embrittlement by Liquid and Solid Metals: Proceedings of the Symposium, M. H. Kamdar, Ed., Metallurgical Society of AIME, Warrendale, PA, 1984, p. 149.Benson, B. A. and Hoagland, R. G., Scripta Metallurgica, 23 (1989) 1943.Kargol, J. A. and Albright, D. L., Journal of Testing and Evaluation, 3 (1975) 173.D.G. Kolman and R. Chavarria, Corrosion, 60 (2004) 254.  Mechanisms  Many theories have been proposed for LME. The major ones are listed below; *The dissolution-diffusion model of Robertson W. M. Robertson, Trans. Met. Soc. AIME, 236 (1966), 1478 and Glickman E. E. Glickman and Y. V. Goryunov, Sov. Mater. Sci., (1978), 355 says that absorption of the liquid metal on the solid metal induces dissolution and inward diffusion. Under stress these processes lead to crack nucleation and propagation. *The brittle fracture theory of Stoloff and Johnson,N. S. Stoloff and T. L. Johnston, Acta Met., 11 (1963), 251 Westwood and Kamdar A. R. C. Westwood and M. H. Kamdar, Phil. Mag., 8 (1963), 787 proposed that the adsorption of the liquid metal atoms at the crack tip weakens inter-atomic bonds and propagates the crack. *Gordon P. Gordon and H. H. Ann, Met. Trans., A 13 (1982), 457 postulated a model based on diffusion-penetration of liquid metal atoms to nucleate cracks which under stress grow to cause failure. *The ductile failure model of Lynch S. P. Lynch, Acta Met., 36 (1988), 2639 and Popovich V. V. Popovich, and I. G. Dmukhovskaya, Sov. Mater. Sci., (1987), 535 predicted that adsorption of the liquid metal leads to weakening of atomic bonds and nucleation of dislocations which move under stress, pile-up and work harden the solid. Also dissolution helps in the nucleation of voids which grow under stress and cause ductile failure. All of these models, with the exception of Robertson,W. M. Robertson, Trans. Met. Soc. AIME, 236 (1966), 1478 utilize the concept of an adsorption-induced surface energy lowering of the solid metal as the central cause of LME. They have succeeded in predicting many of the phenomenological observations. However, quantitative prediction of LME is still elusive. Mercury embrittlement The most common liquid metal to cause embrittlement is mercury. The embrittling effects of mercury were first recognized by Pliny the Elder circa 78 AD. Mercury spills present especially significant danger for airplanes. The aluminium-zinc-magnesium- copper alloy DTD 5050B is especially susceptible. The Al-Cu alloy DTD 5020A is less susceptible. Spilled elemental mercury can be immobilized and made relatively harmless by silver nitrate. On 1 January 2004, the Moomba, South Australia, natural gas processing plant operated by Santos suffered a major fire. The gas release that led to the fire was caused by the failure of a heat exchanger (cold box) inlet nozzle in the liquids recovery plant. The failure of the inlet nozzle was due to liquid metal embrittlement of the train B aluminium cold box by elemental mercury. Alt URL Popular culture Liquid metal embrittlement plays a central role in the novel Killer Instinct by Joseph Finder. In the film Big Hero 6, Honey Lemon, voiced by Genesis Rodriguez, uses liquid metal embrittlement in her lab.

MuleSoft offers an Enterprise Edition of Mule that provides a management console, a Service registry and higher availability. =Cloudhub= Cloudhub is Mulesoft's Cloud-based integration platform for integration to connect apps, data and devices with integration connectors (like one to Twitter, etc.) platform as a service (iPaaS). Mule ESB and Messaging=AMQP Support AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) support is based on the RabbitMQ Java Client and supports AMQP up to 0.9.1.http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/AMQP+Connector JMS Support JMS (Java Message Service) is a Message-oriented middleware API provided by Oracle for communication between different components of an application. This provides reliable, loosely coupled and asynchronous message- based communication, supporting two models: point-to-point (queues) and publish-subscribe (topics). Mule supports all functionality of JMS specification versions 1.0.2b and 1.1, and provides an endpoint for the same. WMQ Support WMQ or Websphere MQ is IBM Message Oriented Middleware product for communication of distributed system. Mule also provides support for WMQ called Mule WMQ Transport which works with 7.0, 7.1 and 7.5 versions and provides endpoint for the same. Universal Message Object The Universal Message Object Application Programming Interface is part of high-level design methodologies used to describe and define aspects of a data object used in conjunction with the Mule ESB. The idea is to, by staged events, wrap the work into sensible bundles and process it in stages that can conform to models of transaction-based processing that are useful in time or mission-critical applications such as financial transactions, where subsequent successful outcomes are required to permit the desired outcome. But if the user fails to supply needed data or a run-time error occurs, then the model will allow for stateful backoff, meaning \\"no harm done\\", the user may then complete a transaction without losing too much work or canceling an entire transaction. Universal Message Object defines the parameters that the program will use for internal messaging communications and its components to set and get variables based upon the user's needs and the program's functionality.

The term is mainly used in connection with 18th or 19th century commercial illustrations for magazines and books or reproductions of paintings. It is not a technical term in printmaking, and can cover a variety of techniques, giving similar results. Steel engraving is an overlapping term, for images that in fact are often mainly in etching, mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and decorative prints, often reproductive, from about 1820 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less used. Copperplate engraving is another somewhat outdated term for engravings. With photography long established, engravings made today are nearly all artistic ones in printmaking, but the technique is not as common as it used to be; more than other printmaking techniques, engraving requires great skill and much practice, even for an experienced artist. Technique Engraving for the purpose of printmaking creates plates for intaglio printing. Intaglio engravings are made by carving into a plate of a hard substance such as copper, zinc, steel, or plastic. Afterward ink is rubbed into the carved areas and away from the flat surface. Moistened paper is placed over the plate and both are run through the rollers of an intaglio press. The pressure exerted by the press on the paper pushes it into the engraved lines and prints the image made by those lines. In an intaglio print, the engraved lines print black. Wood engraving is a relief printing technique, with the images made by carving into fine-grained hardwood blocks. Ink is rolled onto the surface of the block, dry paper is placed on top of the block and it is printed either by rolling both through a press, or, by hand, using a baren to rub the ink from the surface of the block onto the paper. In a relief print, the engraved lines show white. Early history The art of engraving has been practiced from the earliest ages. The prehistoric Aztec hatchet given to Alexander von Humboldt in Mexico was just as truly engraved as a modern copper-plate which may convey a design by John Flaxman; the Aztec engraving may be less sophisticated than the European, but it is the same art form. Jewelry and many types of fine metal works frequently are engraved as well as furniture. Engraving often is used as an embellishment of knives, swords, guns, and rifles. Niellos The important discovery which made line engraving one of the multiplying arts was the accidental discovery of how to print an incised line. This method was known for some time before its real utility was realized. The goldsmiths of Florence in the middle of the 15th century ornamented their works by means of engraving, after which they filled up the hollows produced by the burin with a black enamel-like substance made of silver, lead, and sulfur. The resulting design, called a niello, was much higher in contrast and thus, much more visible. As this enamel was difficult to remove, goldsmiths developed alternate means of viewing their work while still in progress. They would take a sulfur cast of the work on a matrix of fine clay, and fill up the lines in the sulfur with lampblack, producing the desired high-contrast image. Beginnings of European printmaking It was discovered later that a proof could be taken on damped paper by filling the engraved lines with ink and wiping it off the surface of the plate. Pressure was then applied to push the paper into the hollowed lines and draw the ink out of them. This was the beginning of plate printing. This convenient way of proofing a niello saved the effort of producing a cast, but further implications went unexplored. Although goldsmiths continued to engrave nielli to ornament plates and furniture, it was not until the late 15th century that the new method of printing was implemented. Early style In early Italian and German prints, the line is used with such perfect simplicity of purpose that the methods of the artists are as obvious as if we saw them actually at work. In all these figures the outline is the primary focus, followed by the lines which mark the leading folds of the drapery. These are always engravers' lines, such as may be made naturally with the burin, and they never imitate the freer line of the pencil or etching needle. Shading is used in the greatest moderation with thin straight strokes that never overpower the stronger organic lines of the design. In early metal engraving the shading lines are often cross-hatched. In the earliest woodcuts they are not. The reason being that when lines are incised, they may as easily be crossed, as not. Whereas when they are reserved, the crossing involves much non-artistic labor. =Italy= The early style of Italian engravers differs greatly from that of a modern chiaroscurist. Mantegna, for example, did not draw and shade at the same time. He got his outlines and the patterns on his dresses all very accurate initially. Then he added a veil of shading with all the lines being straight and all the shading diagonal. This is the primitive method, its peculiarities being due to a combination of natural genius with technical inexperience. Detail of an engraving by Marcantonio Marcantonio, the engraver trained by Raphael, first practiced by copying German woodcuts into line engravings. Marcantonio became an engraver of remarkable power and through him, the pure art of line-engraving reached its maturity. He retained much of the simple early Italian manner in his backgrounds. His figures are modeled boldly in curved lines, crossing each other in the darker shades, but left single in the passages from dark to light and breaking away in fine dots as they approach the light itself, which is of pure white paper. A new Italian school of engraving was born, which put aside minute details for a broad, harmonious treatment. =Germany= The characteristics of early metal engraving in Germany are demonstrated in the works of Martin Schongauer (d. 1488) and Albrecht D√ºrer (d. 1528). Schongauer used outline and shade as a unified element, and the shading, generally in curved lines. His skill is far more masterly than the straight shading of Mantegna. D√ºrer continued Schongauer's curved shading, with increasing manual delicacy and skill, and over-loaded his plates with quantities of living and inanimate objects. He applied the same intensity of study to every art form he explored. Peter Paul Rubens and the engravers he employed, made marked technical developments in the field of engraving. Instead of his finished paintings, Rubens provided his engravers with drawings as guides, allowing them to discard the Italian outline method and in its place substitute modeling. They substituted broad masses for the minutely-finished detail of the northern schools, and adopted a system of a dark and light characteristic of engraving, which reportedly Rubens stated, rendered the detail as more harmonious. A flourishing art form: 17th and 18th centuries An example of stipple engraving, using tiny dots to create soft tonal effects, by Francesco Bartolozzi In the 17th and 18th centuries, line engraving made no new development. Instead, it flourished around the established techniques and principles. English and French artists began to use the technique, with the English learning primarily from the Germans (led by Rubens), and the French from the Italians (Raphael). There was, however, a good deal of cross-influence among all involved traditions. Sir Robert Strange, as many other English engravers, made it his study to soften and lose the outline, specifically in figure-engraving. Meanwhile, Gerard Audran (d. 1703) led the Renaissance school in perfecting the art of modeling with the burin. A technological foe: the 19th century In the 19th century, line engraving was both helped and hindered. Help came from the growth of public wealth, increasing interest in art, and the increase in the commerce of art‚Äîas exemplified by the career of such art dealers as Ernest Gambart‚Äîand the growing demand for illustrated books. Hindrance to line engraving came from the desire for cheaper and more rapid methods ‚Äì a desire satisfied in various ways, but especially, by etching and various kinds of photography. An engraved portrait of Daniel Webster by Duyckinick, 1873 The history of the art of line engraving during the last quarter of the 19th century, is one of continued decay. It was hoped that technical improvements might save the art, but by the beginning of the 20th century, pictorial line engraving in England was practically non-existent. The disappearance of the art is due to the fact that the public refused to wait for several years for proofs (some important proofs took as long as 12 years to create) when they could obtain their plates more quickly by other methods. The invention of steel-facing S copper plate enabled the engraver to proceed more quickly; but even in this case he can no more compete with the etcher than the mezzotint engraver can keep pace with the photogravure manufacturer. Line-engraving flourished in France until the early 20th century, only through official encouragement and intelligent fostering by collectors and connoisseurs. The class of the work has entirely changed, however, partly through the reduction of prices paid for it, partly through the change of taste and fashion, and partly, again, through the necessities of the situation. French engravers were driven to simplify their work in order to satisfy public impatience. To compensate for loss of color, the art developed in the direction of elegance and refinement. In Italy, line engraving decayed just as it had in England, and outside Europe, line engraving seems almost nonexistent. Here and there a spasmodic attempt may be made to appeal to the artistic appreciation of a limited public, but generally, no attention is paid to these efforts. There are still a few who can engrave a head from a photograph or drawing, or a small engraving for book illustration or for book plates; there are more who are highly proficient in mechanical engraving for decorative purposes, but the engraving-machine is quickly superseding this class. Style Nineteenth century line engraving, compared with previous work, had a more thorough and delicate rendering of local color, light and shade, and texture. Older engravers could draw just as correctly, but they either neglected these elements or admitted them sparingly, as opposed to the spirit of their art, but there is a certain sameness in pure line engraving that is more favorable to some forms and textures than to others. In the well-known prints from Rosa Bonheur, for example, the tone of the skies is achieved by machine-ruling, as is much undertone in the landscape. The fur of the animals is all etched, as are the foreground plants; the real burin work is used sparingly where most favorable to texture. Even in the exquisite engravings after J. M. W. Turner, which reached a degree of delicacy in light and shade far surpassing the work of the old masters, the engravers had recourse to etching, finishing with the burin and dry point. Considered as important an influence upon engraving as Raphael and Rubens, Turner contributed much to the field in the direction of delicacy of tone. The new French school of engraving had several distinctive characteristics, including the substitution of exquisite greys for the rich blacks of old and, simplicity of method coupled with extremely high elaboration. Their object is, as always, to secure the faithful transcript of the painter they reproduce while readily sacrificing the power of the old method, which, whatever its force and beauty, was easily acquired by mediocre artists of technical ability. The Belgian school of engraving elaborated an effective \\"mixed method\\" of graver-work and dry-point. The Stauffer-Bern method of using many fine lines to create tone had a certain advantage in modeling. Modern and contemporary art Although dwindled to a rarity, modern engravers continue to practice in the art world, most prominently Andrew Raftery. His choice of subjects is comparable to Hogarth, and his style the French school of elegant and geometrical form.Hirsch, Faye. \\"Art at the Threshold: An Inch in Andrew Raftery's _Open House_ , _Art in Print_ Vol. 5 No. 5 (January-February 2016). Tools of the trade The most important of the tools used in line-engraving is the burin, or graver, a bar of steel with one end fixed in a handle, somewhat resembling a mushroom with one side cut away. The burin is shaped so that the sharpened, cutting end takes the form of a lozenge, and points downward. The burin acts exactly as a plough in the earth: it makes a furrow and turns out a shaving of metal in the same way a plough turns the soil of a field. The burin, unlike a plough, is pushed through the material. This particular characteristic at once establishes a wide separation between it, and all the other instruments employed in the arts of design, such as pencils, brushes, pens, and etching needles. Example of burin engraving The elements of engraving with the burin are evident in the engraving of letters, specifically, the capital letter B. This letter consists of two perpendicular straight lines and four distinct curves. The engraver scratches these lines, reversed, very lightly with a sharp point or stylus. Next, the engraver cuts out the blacks (not the whites, as in wood engraving) with two different burins. First, the vertical black line is ploughed with the burin between the two scratched lines, then similarly, some material is removed from the thickest parts of the two curves. Finally, the gradations from the thick middle of the curve to the thin points touching the vertical are worked out with a finer burin. The hollows are then filled with printing ink, the surplus ink is wiped from the smooth surface of the metal, damped paper is laid upon the surface and driven into the hollowed letter by the pressure of a revolving cylinder. The paper draws out the ink, and the letter B is printed in intense black. When the surface of a metal plate is sufficiently polished to be used for engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black line. An engraved plate from which visiting cards are printed is a good example of some elementary principles of engraving. It contains thin lines and thick ones, as well as a considerable variety of curves. An elaborate line engraving, if it is a pure line engraving and nothing else, will contain only these simple elements in different combinations. The real line engraver is always engraving a line more or less broad and deep in one direction or another; he has no other business than this.

The palace was built in two periods, from 1736 until 1740 and from 1764 until 1768. It is situated at PilsrundƒÅle, 12 km west of Bauska. History In 1735 Duke of Courland Ernst Johann von Biron bought land in RundƒÅle with an old medieval castle in the territory of a planned summer residence. The old castle was demolished and construction after the design of Bartolomeo Rastrelli started in 1736. Construction proceeded slowly because part of the materials and resources were transferred to the construction of Jelgava Palace, a project which was more important for the duke. Following Biron's fall from grace in 1740, the palace stood unfinished and empty until 1762 when Biron returned from his exile. Under the supervision of Rastrelli its construction was finished in 1768. Johann Michael Graff produced lavish stucco decorations for the palace during this time. Ernst Johann von Biron loved the palace and moved there almost immediately in 1768. He often visited the palace and spent summers there until his death in 1772. After Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was absorbed by the Russian Empire in 1795, Catherine the Great presented the palace to Count Valerian Zubov, the youngest brother of her lover, Prince Platon Zubov. He spent his declining years there after the death of Valerian Zubov in 1804. His young widow, Thekla Walentinowicz, a local landowner's daughter, married Count Shuvalov, and the palace passed into the control of the Shuvalov family, with whom it remained until the German occupation in World War I when the German army established a hospital and a commandant's office there. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the palace was used as a hospital for Napoleon's army. Several soldiers who died in this hospital were buried in the park of the palace. A monument has since been built there. At the end of the 19th century, the palace and park were restored and reconstructed. The palace suffered serious damage in 1919 during the Latvian War of Independence. During their retreat Bermontians partially burned the palace. In 1920 after Latvian agrarian reforms the palace became the property of the Ministry of Agriculture. Part of the premises were occupied by the local school and part was reconstructed as flats for Latvian military veterans. Though still used as a school, RundƒÅle Palace was included in the list of state-protected monuments in 1924. In 1933, RundƒÅle Palace was taken over by the Ministry of Education and was officially reconstructed for use as a school. The palace was dealt a serious blow after World War II, when a grain storehouse was set up in the premises in addition to the school. Later, the duke's dining room was transformed into the school's gymnasium. A school was located in the palace until 1978. In 1963, RundƒÅle Palace became a branch of the Bauska local history museum. In 1965 and also in 1971, the Supreme Soviet of Latvian SSR decided to restore RundƒÅle Palace. In 1972, RundƒÅle Palace Museum was established.Lancmanis, Imants, RundƒÅle Palace, RundƒÅle Palace Museum, 2007 Latvian painter and art historian Imants Lancmanis became director of the new museum and restoration of the palace became his life's work. Extensive research and restoration work was completely funded by the state until 1992. After the restoration of Latvia's independence, the state continued to finance restoration work in part, with additional financing through private donations and later also through the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund of the EU. In the spring of 2015 it was announced that restoration work in the RundƒÅle Palace was complete. Total restoration costs from 1972 until 2014 were estimated to be 8,420,495 euros.http://www.kasjauns.lv/lv/zinas/154588/rundales-pili-beigusies- grandioza-restauracija-ta-ilgusi-50-gadus-foto The palace is one of the major tourist destinations in Latvia.

Plot synopsis The story, a spy thriller, is centered on a young Jewish-American man named Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Furst, who is initially introduced as a college student studying political science. After passing several tests, including a fake mugging, he is recruited by a beautiful young woman named D. D. into the Central Intelligence Agency and told that he is going to be the first agent of Project Fire (hence the title of the comic), an experiment to test whether training agents out of ordinary citizens can be successful. Ben passes and becomes an agent under the command of Linda Dagger. He is placed in England to pose as a journalist named Jake Donaldson, and he is dispatched from time-to- time to set up assassinations in places around the world ranging from Japan to Brazil. He gradually becomes disillusioned with his lifestyle and job, and he begins to suspect that he is being set up himself. One day, D. D., who had previously always treated him coldly, has sex with him. When Ben wakes up the next day, he is attacked by contract killers; Ben kills them and then breaks into CIA headquarters. He discovers that Project Fire is not a new experimental project, but rather something that has been going on for years; each such Project Fire agent is killed once the agent's superiors decide he has become a liability. Ben attempts to escape with the information, but he is captured by Linda Dagger. Dagger sends D. D. to kill Ben, but Ben kills D. D. instead and escapes. He tries to send the information he has to a journalist to publicize, but before he can, at the end of the comic, Dagger finds him again and informs him that he either works for her or dies.

It is based on the true story of the Cleveland Torso Murderer, and the efforts of the famous lawman Eliot Ness and his band of the \\"Unknowns‚Äù to capture him. Bendis was initially inspired to write the novel after reading the files about the murders. As a Cleveland native, Bendis wrote the novel to pay homage to his hometown. Together with co-writer Andreyko, they crafted the comic with various historical photographs and clippings from the era. After its release, the graphic novel was critically well-received by the comic book community and elevated Bendis' career in the industry. The graphic novel was originally published by Image Comics and later reprinted under Marvel's Icon imprint. Since then, various attempts to adapt the novel into film have been proposed. Publication history Torso was originally published as a six-issue limited series by Image Comics. Bendis envisioned the comic as a historical true story which he turned into a graphic novel. March 19, 2012 Torso was written during Bendis' time as a struggling writer in his hometown Cleveland. His inspiration came while working as a cartoonist in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, where his editor gave him access to the Cleveland Torso Murders files. The files contained all of the visual evidences and testimonies, such as photographs, interviews and newspaper excerpts for Bendis to create the novel. His particular inspiration was that of a picture of a coroner examining a dismembered leg with a magnifying glass, which he described as \\"the opposite of CSI.\\" Besides the archives, Bendis and Mark also took information from Eliot Ness' own written interviews. He surmised their work during an interview: In creating the atmosphere of the comic, Marc used historical photographs and documents combined with his black-and-white artwork to tell a unique noir-like story. January 25, 2002 Bendis and Andreyko presented their story in a straightforward cinematic fashion, with the occasional use of silent and repeated panels and sparse dialogue to create tension. The use of photography and clippings in the comic is also focused upon, with Marc's intention of presenting it like a film comic, creating a tone of realism. Bendis also provided the art and lettering, as well as his trademark \\"sharp and contrast\\" dialogue he would later use in his future projects. Synopsis Torso tells the story of the real life \\"Torso Murderer\\", a serial killer who was active during 1934 to 1938. He received his nickname because he left only the torsos of his victims. Without fingerprints or dental records, these victims were very difficult to identify in a time before DNA testing. The investigator on the case was Eliot Ness, Cleveland Safety Director and former head of the Untouchables. Collected editions The series was collected in a trade paperback, Torso: A True Crime Graphic Novel (), in 2001, and also published by Image. Marvel Comics reformatted and reprinted the comic book in its Icon imprint in March 2012. Reception and awards After its release, Torso was met with critical acclaim from both critics and consumers alike. The graphic novel won the 1999 Eisner Award for \\"Comic Book Excellence, Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition\\".Awards Presented at the 1999 Comic-Con International Torso was nominated for an International Horror Guild award for best graphic story and for 3 International Eagle Awards. The graphic novel elevated both Bendis and Marc's careers in the comic book industry, which soon led Bendis being discovered and recruited by Marvel as well as solidifying his reputation as a crime writer. March 19, 2012 Comic Book Resources called it \\"one of the great crime comics of the late 20th Century.\\" Today, the graphic novel is considered as one of the best of its genre. Comics Alliance listed the graphic novel in its \\"8 of the Best Noir Comics\\", calling it a \\"an engaging and ‚Äî unsurprisingly ‚Äî genuinely creepy story.\\" May 26, 2011 Top Tenz ranked in at #4 in its list \\"Top 10 Crime Comics\\", describing it as a \\"stunning and chilling examination of one of America‚Äôs great unsolved crime sprees.\\" February 20, 2013 Jesse Schedeen from IGN ranked Torso at #5 in her \\"9 Great Murder Mystery Comics\\", stating that it \\"used these real-world events to weave a great mystery with a dramatic climax.\\" August 5, 2014 Film On January 12, 2006, Variety reported that director David Fincher would be directing a film version of Torso for Miramax. The producers are Bill Mechanic, Don Murphy, Todd McFarlane and Terry Fitzgerald. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger is set to adapt the series. In a September 27, 2009 unedited episode of Fanboy Radio, Bendis confirmed the Torso film has been canceled by Miramax and the rights have reverted to Bendis. The story of the failed attempt to make the film was told in Bendis's autobiographical graphic novel, Fortune and Glory. In 2013, new plans for an adaptation was greenlit, with David Lowery hired to write and direct the film. April 17, 2013 Bendis said that while the projects had its ups and downs over the last 15 years, he‚Äôs never lost belief in its cinematic potential.Hollywood Reporter: 'Ain't Them Bodies Saints' Filmmaker to Adapt Brian Michael Bendis' 'Torso' (Exclusive) On March 12, 2017, Deadline reported that director Paul Greengrass will direct and produce Ness for Paramount Pictures with producers John Davis, Greg Goodman and John Fox producing from Davis Entertainment with David Engel from Circle of Confusion.

A crash simulation is a virtual recreation of a destructive crash test of a car or a highway guard rail system using a computer simulation in order to examine the level of safety of the car and its occupants. Crash simulations are used by automakers during computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis for crashworthiness in the computer-aided design (CAD) process of modelling new cars. During a crash simulation, the kinetic energy, or energy of motion, that a vehicle has before the impact is transformed into deformation energy, mostly by plastic deformation (plasticity) of the car body material (Body in White), at the end of the impact. Data obtained from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a collision (and also pedestrians hit by a car) against injury. Important results are the deformations (for example, steering wheel intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, passengers) and the decelerations (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal car safety regulations. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of crash test dummies and of passive safety devices (seat belts, airbags, shock absorbing dash boards, etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.  Origin  In the years 1970 attempts were made to simulate car crash events with non-linear spring- mass systems after calibration, which require as an input the results of physical destructive laboratory tests, needed to determine the mechanical crushing behavior of each spring component of the modeled system. \\"First principle\\" simulations like more elaborate finite element models, however, need only the definition of the structural geometry and the basic material properties (rheology of car body steel, glass, plastic parts, etc.) as an input to generate the numerical model. The origins of industrial first principle computerized car crash simulation lie in military defense, outer space and civil nuclear power plant applications. Upon presentation of a simulation of the accidental crash of a military fighter plane into a nuclear power plant on May 30, 1978 by ESI Group in a meeting organized by the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) in Stuttgart, car makers became alerted to the possibility of using this technology for the simulation of destructive car crash tests (Haug 1981). The first successful frontal full car crash simulation: a Volkswagen Polo collided with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h (ESI 1986). In the following years, German car makers produced more complex crash simulation studies, simulating the crash behavior of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half car bodies in white (BIW). These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers (Audi, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, Porsche, and Volkswagen), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers were able to make efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behavior of the analyzed car body structure.  Application  Crash simulations are used to investigate the safety of the car occupants during impacts on the front end structure of the car in a \\"head-on collision\\" or \\"frontal impact\\", the lateral structure of the car in a ‚Äúside collision‚Äù or ‚Äúside impact‚Äù, the rear end structure of a car in a \\"rear-end collision\\" or ‚Äúrear impact‚Äù, and the roof structure of the car when it overturns during a \\"rollover\\". Crash simulations can also be used to assess injury to pedestrians hit by a car.  Benefits  A crash simulation produces results without actual destructive testing of a new car model. This way, tests can be performed quickly and inexpensively in a computer, which permits optimization of the design before a real prototype of the car has been manufactured. Using a simulation, problems can be solved before spending time and money on an actual crash test. The great flexibility of printed output and graphical display enables designers to solve some problems that would have been nearly impossible without the help of a computer.  Analysis  A subdivision of the metal exterior of the car, called a finite element, is connected to nodes at each vertex. Large number of crash simulations use a method of analysis called the Finite Element Method. The complex problems are solved by dividing a surface into a large but still finite number of elements and determining the motion of these elements over very small periods of time. Another approach to crash simulations is performed by application of Macro Element Method. The difference between two mentioned above methodologies is that the structure in case of Macro Element Method consists of smaller number of elements. The calculation algorithm of structure deformation is based on experimental data rather than calculated from partial differential equations. Pam-Crash started crash simulation and together with LS-DYNA is a software package which is widely used for application of Finite Element Method. This method allows detailed modeling of a structure, but the disadvantage lies in high processing unit requirements and calculation time. The Visual Crash Studio uses Macro Element Methodology. In comparison with FEM it has some modeling and boundary condition limitations but its application does not require advanced computers and the calculation time is incomparably smaller. Two presented methods complement each other. Macro Element Method is useful at early stage of the structure design process while Finite Element Method performs well at its final stages.  Structural analysis  In a typical crash simulation, the car body structure is analyzed using spatial discretization, that is, breaking up the continuous movement of the body in real time into smaller changes in position over small, discrete time steps. The discretization involves subdividing the surface of the constituent, thin, sheet metal parts into a large number (approaching one million in 2006) of quadrilateral or triangular regions, each of which spans the area between \\"nodes\\" to which its corners are fixed. Each element has mass, which is distributed as concentrated masses and as mass moments of inertia to its connecting nodes. Each node has 6 kinematic degrees of freedom, that is, one node can move in three linear directions under translation and can rotate about three independent axes. The spatial coordinates (x), displacement (u), velocity (v), and acceleration (a) of each node is mostly expressed in a three-dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate system with axes X,Y, and Z. If the nodes move during a crash simulation, the connected elements move, stretch, and bend with their nodes, which causes them to impart forces and moments to their nodal connections. The forces and moments at the nodes correspond to the inertia forces and moments, caused by their translational (linear) and angular accelerations and to the forces and moments transmitted by the resistance of the structural material of the connected elements as they deform. Sometimes, additional external structural loads are applied, like gravity loads from the self weight of the parts, or added loads from external masses. The forces and moments of all nodes are collected into a column vector (or column matrix), and the time dependent equations of motion (in dynamic equilibrium) can be written as follows. :\\\\mathbf{Ma} = \\\\mathbf{F}_{ext} - \\\\mathbf{F}_{int} where vector \\\\mathbf{Ma} (mass times acceleration vector) collects the inertia forces at the nodes, \\\\mathbf{F}_{ext} collects the external nodal loads, and \\\\mathbf{F}_{int} collects the internal resisting forces from the deformation of the material. M is a diagonal matrix of the nodal masses. Each vector (u, v, a, F, etc.) has dimension 6 times the total number of nodes in the crash model (about 6 million ‚Äúdegrees of freedom‚Äù for every 1 million \\"nodes\\" in 3-D thin shell finite element models).  Time analysis  A crash simulation uses time discretization as well to separate the continuous changes in time into very small, usable segments. The dynamic equations of motion hold at all times during a crash simulation and must be integrated in time, t, starting from an initial condition at time zero, which is just prior to the crash. According to the explicit finite difference time integration method used by most crash codes, the accelerations, velocities, and displacements of the body are related by the following equations. :\\\\mathbf{a}_{n} = \\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{F}_{ext} - \\\\mathbf{F}_{int})_n :\\\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} = \\\\mathbf{v}_{n-1/2} + \\\\mathbf{a}_{n}\\\\Delta t_n :\\\\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = \\\\mathbf{u}_n + \\\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}\\\\Delta t_{n+1/2} In these equations the subscripts n¬±1/2, n, n+1 denote past, present, and future times, t, at half and full-time intervals with time steps \\\\Delta t_n and \\\\Delta t_{n+1/2}, respectively.  Solution  The above system of linear equations is solved for the accelerations, \\\\mathbf{a}_{n}, the velocities, \\\\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}, and the displacements, \\\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}, at each discrete point in time, t, during the crash duration. This solution is trivial, since the mass matrix is diagonal. The computer time is proportional to the number of finite elements and the number of solution time steps. The stable solution time step, \\\\Delta t, is limited for numerical stability, as expressed by the Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy condition (CFL), which states that ‚Äúin any time- marching computer simulation, the time step must be less than the time for some significant action to occur, and preferably considerably less.\\" In a crash simulation, the fastest significant actions are the acoustic signals that travel inside the structural material. The solid elastic stress wave speed amounts to :c = \\\\sqrt{E_0/\\\\rho} where E_0 is the initial elastic modulus (before plastic deformation) of the material and \\\\rho is the mass density. The largest stable time step for a given material is therefore :\\\\Delta t = d_{min}\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho/E_0}, where d_{min} is the smallest distance between any two nodes of the numerical crash simulation model. Since this distance can change during a simulation, the stable time step changes and must be updated continually as the solution proceeds in time. When using steel, the typical value of the stable time step is about one microsecond when the smallest discrete node distance in the mesh of the finite element model is about 5 millimeters. It needs then more than 100,000 time intervals to solve a crash event that lasts for one tenth of a second. This figure is exceeded in many industrial crash models demanding optimized crash solvers with High- Performance Computing (HPC) features, such as vectorization and parallel computing.

Storage systems typically use special hardware and software along with disk drives in order to provide very fast and reliable storage for computing and data processing. Storage systems are complex, and may be thought of as a special purpose computer designed to provide storage capacity along with advanced data protection features. Disk drives are only one element within a storage system, along with hardware and special purpose embedded software within the system. Storage systems can provide either block accessed storage, or file accessed storage. Block access is typically delivered over Fibre Channel, iSCSI, SAS, FICON or other protocols. File access is often provided using NFS or SMB protocols. Within the context of a storage system, there are two primary types of virtualization that can occur: * Block virtualization used in this context refers to the abstraction (separation) of logical storage (partition) from physical storage so that it may be accessed without regard to physical storage or heterogeneous structure. This separation allows the administrators of the storage system greater flexibility in how they manage storage for end users.SearchStorage.com Definitions * File virtualization addresses the NAS challenges by eliminating the dependencies between the data accessed at the file level and the location where the files are physically stored. This provides opportunities to optimize storage use and server consolidation and to perform non-disruptive file migrations. Block virtualization=Address space remapping Virtualization of storage helps achieve location independence by abstracting the physical location of the data. The virtualization system presents to the user a logical space for data storage and handles the process of mapping it to the actual physical location. It is possible to have multiple layers of virtualization or mapping. It is then possible that the output of one layer of virtualization can then be used as the input for a higher layer of virtualization. Virtualization maps space between back-end resources, to front-end resources. In this instance, \\"back-end\\" refers to a logical unit number (LUN) that is not presented to a computer, or host system for direct use. A \\"front-end\\" LUN or volume is presented to a host or computer system for use. The actual form of the mapping will depend on the chosen implementation. Some implementations may limit the granularity of the mapping which may limit the capabilities of the device. Typical granularities range from a single physical disk down to some small subset (multiples of megabytes or gigabytes) of the physical disk. In a block-based storage environment, a single block of information is addressed using a LUN identifier and an offset within that LUN known as a logical block addressing (LBA). Meta-data The virtualization software or device is responsible for maintaining a consistent view of all the mapping information for the virtualized storage. This mapping information is often called meta-data and is stored as a mapping table. The address space may be limited by the capacity needed to maintain the mapping table. The level of granularity, and the total addressable space both directly impact the size of the meta-data, and hence the mapping table. For this reason, it is common to have trade-offs, between the amount of addressable capacity and the granularity or access granularity. One common method to address these limits is to use multiple levels of virtualization. In several storage systems deployed today, it is common to utilize three layers of virtualization.Need Citation Some implementations do not use a mapping table, and instead calculate locations using an algorithm. These implementations utilize dynamic methods to calculate the location on access, rather than storing the information in a mapping table. I/O redirection The virtualization software or device uses the meta-data to re-direct I/O requests. It will receive an incoming I/O request containing information about the location of the data in terms of the logical disk (vdisk) and translates this into a new I/O request to the physical disk location. For example, the virtualization device may : * Receive a read request for vdisk LUN ID=1, LBA=32 * Perform a meta-data look up for LUN ID=1, LBA=32, and finds this maps to physical LUN ID=7, LBA0 * Sends a read request to physical LUN ID=7, LBA0 * Receives the data back from the physical LUN * Sends the data back to the originator as if it had come from vdisk LUN ID=1, LBA32 Capabilities Most implementations allow for heterogeneous management of multi-vendor storage devices within the scope of a given implementation's support matrix. This means that the following capabilities are not limited to a single vendor's device (as with similar capabilities provided by specific storage controllers) and are in fact possible across different vendors' devices. Replication Data replication techniques are not limited to virtualization appliances and as such are not described here in detail. However most implementations will provide some or all of these replication services. When storage is virtualized, replication services must be implemented above the software or device that is performing the virtualization. This is true because it is only above the virtualization layer that a true and consistent image of the logical disk (vdisk) can be copied. This limits the services that some implementations can implement or makes them seriously difficult to implement. If the virtualization is implemented in the network or higher, this renders any replication services provided by the underlying storage controllers useless. * Remote data replication for disaster recovery ** Synchronous Mirroring where I/O completion is only returned when the remote site acknowledges the completion. Applicable for shorter distances (<200 km) ** Asynchronous Mirroring where I/O completion is returned before the remote site has acknowledged the completion. Applicable for much greater distances (>200 km) * Point-In-Time Snapshots to copy or clone data for diverse uses ** When combined with thin provisioning, enables space-efficient snapshots Pooling The physical storage resources are aggregated into storage pools, from which the logical storage is created. More storage systems, which may be heterogeneous in nature, can be added as and when needed, and the virtual storage space will scale up by the same amount. This process is fully transparent to the applications using the storage infrastructure. Disk management The software or device providing storage virtualization becomes a common disk manager in the virtualized environment. Logical disks (vdisks) are created by the virtualization software or device and are mapped (made visible) to the required host or server, thus providing a common place or way for managing all volumes in the environment. Enhanced features are easy to provide in this environment: * Thin Provisioning to maximize storage utilization ** This is relatively easy to implement as physical storage is only allocated in the mapping table when it is used. * Disk expansion and shrinking ** More physical storage can be allocated by adding to the mapping table (assuming the using system can cope with online expansion) ** Similarly disks can be reduced in size by removing some physical storage from the mapping (uses for this are limited as there is no guarantee of what resides on the areas removed) BenefitsNon-disruptive data migration= One of the major benefits of abstracting the host or server from the actual storage is the ability to migrate data while maintaining concurrent I/O access. The host only knows about the logical disk (the mapped LUN) and so any changes to the meta-data mapping is transparent to the host. This means the actual data can be moved or replicated to another physical location without affecting the operation of any client. When the data has been copied or moved, the meta-data can simply be updated to point to the new location, therefore freeing up the physical storage at the old location. The process of moving the physical location is known as data migration. Most implementations allow for this to be done in a non-disruptive manner, that is concurrently while the host continues to perform I/O to the logical disk (or LUN). The mapping granularity dictates how quickly the meta-data can be updated, how much extra capacity is required during the migration, and how quickly the previous location is marked as free. The smaller the granularity the faster the update, less space required and quicker the old storage can be freed up. There are many day to day tasks a storage administrator has to perform that can be simply and concurrently performed using data migration techniques. * Moving data off an over-utilized storage device. * Moving data onto a faster storage device as needs require * Implementing an Information Lifecycle Management policy * Migrating data off older storage devices (either being scrapped or off-lease) =Improved utilization= Utilization can be increased by virtue of the pooling, migration, and thin provisioning services. This allows users to avoid over-buying and over-provisioning storage solutions. In other words, this kind of utilization through a shared pool of storage can be easily and quickly allocated as it is needed to avoid constraints on storage capacity that often hinder application performance. When all available storage capacity is pooled, system administrators no longer have to search for disks that have free space to allocate to a particular host or server. A new logical disk can be simply allocated from the available pool, or an existing disk can be expanded. Pooling also means that all the available storage capacity can potentially be used. In a traditional environment, an entire disk would be mapped to a host. This may be larger than is required, thus wasting space. In a virtual environment, the logical disk (LUN) is assigned the capacity required by the using host. Storage can be assigned where it is needed at that point in time, reducing the need to guess how much a given host will need in the future. Using Thin Provisioning, the administrator can create a very large thin provisioned logical disk, thus the using system thinks it has a very large disk from day one. =Fewer points of management= With storage virtualization, multiple independent storage devices, even if scattered across a network, appear to be a single monolithic storage device and can be managed centrally. However, traditional storage controller management is still required. That is, the creation and maintenance of RAID arrays, including error and fault management. RisksBacking out a failed implementation= Once the abstraction layer is in place, only the virtualizer knows where the data actually resides on the physical medium. Backing out of a virtual storage environment therefore requires the reconstruction of the logical disks as contiguous disks that can be used in a traditional manner. Most implementations will provide some form of back-out procedure and with the data migration services it is at least possible, but time consuming. =Interoperability and vendor support= Interoperability is a key enabler to any virtualization software or device. It applies to the actual physical storage controllers and the hosts, their operating systems, multi-pathing software and connectivity hardware. Interoperability requirements differ based on the implementation chosen. For example, virtualization implemented within a storage controller adds no extra overhead to host based interoperability, but will require additional support of other storage controllers if they are to be virtualized by the same software. Switch based virtualization may not require specific host interoperability ‚Äî if it uses packet cracking techniques to redirect the I/O. Network based appliances have the highest level of interoperability requirements as they have to interoperate with all devices, storage and hosts. =Complexity= Complexity affects several areas : * Management of environment: Although a virtual storage infrastructure benefits from a single point of logical disk and replication service management, the physical storage must still be managed. Problem determination and fault isolation can also become complex, due to the abstraction layer. * Infrastructure design: Traditional design ethics may no longer apply, virtualization brings a whole range of new ideas and concepts to think about (as detailed here) * The software or device itself: Some implementations are more complex to design and code network based, especially in-band (symmetric) designs in particular ‚Äî these implementations actually handle the I/O requests and so latency becomes an issue. =Meta-data management= Information is one of the most valuable assets in today's business environments. Once virtualized, the meta-data are the glue in the middle. If the meta-data are lost, so is all the actual data as it would be virtually impossible to reconstruct the logical drives without the mapping information. Any implementation must ensure its protection with appropriate levels of back-ups and replicas. It is important to be able to reconstruct the meta-data in the event of a catastrophic failure. The meta- data management also has implications on performance. Any virtualization software or device must be able to keep all the copies of the meta-data atomic and quickly updateable. Some implementations restrict the ability to provide certain fast update functions, such as point-in-time copies and caching where super fast updates are required to ensure minimal latency to the actual I/O being performed. =Performance and scalability= In some implementations the performance of the physical storage can actually be improved, mainly due to caching. Caching however requires the visibility of the data contained within the I/O request and so is limited to in-band and symmetric virtualization software and devices. However these implementations also directly influence the latency of an I/O request (cache miss), due to the I/O having to flow through the software or device. Assuming the software or device is efficiently designed this impact should be minimal when compared with the latency associated with physical disk accesses. Due to the nature of virtualization, the mapping of logical to physical requires some processing power and lookup tables. Therefore, every implementation will add some small amount of latency. In addition to response time concerns, throughput has to be considered. The bandwidth into and out of the meta-data lookup software directly impacts the available system bandwidth. In asymmetric implementations, where the meta-data lookup occurs before the information is read or written, bandwidth is less of a concern as the meta-data are a tiny fraction of the actual I/O size. In-band, symmetric flow through designs are directly limited by their processing power and connectivity bandwidths. Most implementations provide some form of scale-out model, where the inclusion of additional software or device instances provides increased scalability and potentially increased bandwidth. The performance and scalability characteristics are directly influenced by the chosen implementation. Implementation approaches * Host-based * Storage device-based * Network- based =Host-based= Host-based virtualization requires additional software running on the host, as a privileged task or process. In some cases volume management is built into the operating system, and in other instances it is offered as a separate product. Volumes (LUN's) presented to the host system are handled by a traditional physical device driver. However, a software layer (the volume manager) resides above the disk device driver intercepts the I/O requests, and provides the meta-data lookup and I/O mapping. Most modern operating systems have some form of logical volume management built-in (in Linux called Logical Volume Manager or LVM; in Solaris and FreeBSD, ZFS's zpool layer; in Windows called Logical Disk Manager or LDM), that performs virtualization tasks. Note: Host based volume managers were in use long before the term storage virtualization had been coined. Pros * Simple to design and code * Supports any storage type * Improves storage utilization without thin provisioning restrictions it uses to store a data in virtually an access it virtually Cons * Storage utilization optimized only on a per host basis * Replication and data migration only possible locally to that host * Software is unique to each operating system * No easy way of keeping host instances in sync with other instances * Traditional Data Recovery following a server disk drive crash is impossible =Specific examples= * Technologies: ** Logical volume management ** File systems, e.g., (hard links, SMB/NFS) ** Automatic mounting, e.g., (autofs) =Storage device-based= Like host-based virtualization, several categories have existed for years and have only recently been classified as virtualization. Simple data storage devices, like single hard disk drives, do not provide any virtualization. But even the simplest disk arrays provide a logical to physical abstraction, as they use RAID schemes to join multiple disks in a single array (and possibly later divide the array it into smaller volumes). Advanced disk arrays often feature cloning, snapshots and remote replication. Generally these devices do not provide the benefits of data migration or replication across heterogeneous storage, as each vendor tends to use their own proprietary protocols. A new breed of disk array controllers allows the downstream attachment of other storage devices. For the purposes of this article we will only discuss the later style which do actually virtualize other storage devices. Concept A primary storage controller provides the services and allows the direct attachment of other storage controllers. Depending on the implementation these may be from the same or different vendors. The primary controller will provide the pooling and meta-data management services. It may also provide replication and migration services across those controllers which it is . Pros * No additional hardware or infrastructure requirements * Provides most of the benefits of storage virtualization * Does not add latency to individual I/Os Cons * Storage utilization optimized only across the connected controllers * Replication and data migration only possible across the connected controllers and same vendors device for long distance support * Downstream controller attachment limited to vendors support matrix * I/O Latency, non cache hits require the primary storage controller to issue a secondary downstream I/O request * Increase in storage infrastructure resource, the primary storage controller requires the same bandwidth as the secondary storage controllers to maintain the same throughput =Network- based= Storage virtualization operating on a network based device (typically a standard server or smart switch) and using iSCSI or FC Fibre channel networks to connect as a SAN. These types of devices are the most commonly available and implemented form of virtualization. The virtualization device sits in the SAN and provides the layer of abstraction between the hosts performing the I/O and the storage controllers providing the storage capacity. Pros * True heterogeneous storage virtualization * Caching of data (performance benefit) is possible when in-band * Single management interface for all virtualized storage * Replication services across heterogeneous devices Cons * Complex interoperability matrices limited by vendors support * Difficult to implement fast meta-data updates in switched-based devices * Out-of-band requires specific host based software * In-band may add latency to I/O * In-band the most complicated to design and code Appliance-based vs. switch-based There are two commonly available implementations of network-based storage virtualization, appliance-based and switch-based. Both models can provide the same services, disk management, metadata lookup, data migration and replication. Both models also require some processing hardware to provide these services. Appliance based devices are dedicated hardware devices that provide SAN connectivity of one form or another. These sit between the hosts and storage and in the case of in-band (symmetric) appliances can provide all of the benefits and services discussed in this article. I/O requests are targeted at the appliance itself, which performs the meta-data mapping before redirecting the I/O by sending its own I/O request to the underlying storage. The in-band appliance can also provide caching of data, and most implementations provide some form of clustering of individual appliances to maintain an atomic view of the metadata as well as cache data. Switch based devices, as the name suggests, reside in the physical switch hardware used to connect the SAN devices. These also sit between the hosts and storage but may use different techniques to provide the metadata mapping, such as packet cracking to snoop on incoming I/O requests and perform the I/O redirection. It is much more difficult to ensure atomic updates of metadata in a switched environment and services requiring fast updates of data and metadata may be limited in switched implementations. =In-band vs. out- of-band= In-band, also known as symmetric, virtualization devices actually sit in the data path between the host and storage. All I/O requests and their data pass through the device. Hosts perform I/O to the virtualization device and never interact with the actual storage device. The virtualization device in turn performs I/O to the storage device. Caching of data, statistics about data usage, replications services, data migration and thin provisioning are all easily implemented in an in-band device. Out-of-band, also known as asymmetric, virtualization devices are sometimes called meta-data servers. These devices only perform the meta-data mapping functions. This requires additional software in the host which knows to first request the location of the actual data. Therefore, an I/O request from the host is intercepted before it leaves the host, a meta-data lookup is requested from the meta-data server (this may be through an interface other than the SAN) which returns the physical location of the data to the host. The information is then retrieved through an actual I/O request to the storage. Caching is not possible as the data never passes through the device.

In the , Brookfield had a population of 3,524 people. Geography Brookfield is located approximately west of the Brisbane CBD. Brookfield lies approximately north of the Brisbane River. Moggill Creek flows through Brookfield and joins the Brisbane River at Kenmore.Moggill Creek, 1890 (possibly taken during Field Naturalists' excursion in December 1890) James Brimblecombe's residence 'Fairview' at Brookfield, Brisbane, 1920s Brookfield is a semi-rural suburb consisting primarily of acreage properties. Although there are a small number of farms, the vast majority of property is residential. Moggill Road passes through the southernmost tip of the suburb and Moggill Creek marks part of the suburb's eastern boundary. North of Brookfield are the forested hills and mountains in D'Aguilar National Park. The centre of Brookfield is on the intersection of Brookfield Road and Boscombe Road. The Brookfield General Store, Brookfield Public Hall, Brookfield Showground, Brookfield Cemetery, Brookfield Recreation Reserve, the Anglican church and the school are all in this area. The Brookfield Horse & Pony Club operates out of the showgrounds. History Brookfield is believed to be named by Lucinda Brimblecombe (n√©e Logan) due to course of Moggil Creek through the area. Brisbane was occupied by the Turrbal Aboriginal group. Development in the Brookfield area began in 1869, when the area was opened for logging and farming. Brookfield State School opened on 27 Mar 1871. In 1874 a teacher's residence was built for the school. Brookfield Post Office opened on 12 August 1876. Brookfield Cemetery was opened in 1882. In October 1892 the Anglican parish of Indoorpilly purchased land for a church on the north-east corner of Brookfield Road and Boscombe Road for ¬£20 from the owner, William Thomas Gee. The Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd cost ¬£220 to build and was consecrated on Easter Monday 2 April 1893 by Anglican Bishop of Brisbane, William Webber. The first Brookfield Show was held in 1910. The town hall was moved from Darra to Brookfield in 1931. In 1932, the school teacher's residence was too small for a teacher with nine children, so a new building was constructed. The old building was bought by the Brookfield Hall trustees and relocated it where it became the Brookfield General Store. In 1957 Rita O'Hanlan offered riding lessons at the showgrounds, which evolved into the Brookfield Horse and Pony Club.  Heritage listings  Brookfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 550 Brookfield Road: Brookfield Public Hall & Showgrounds * 615 Brookfield Road: Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd Attractions Every year the Brookfield Show is held over three days. The 2006 Brookfield show attracted almost 22,000 visitors. A formal ball is held annually in Brookfield. The 2005 Show Ball had 550 attendees, 2006, 2007 and 2008 attracted 800 people. Education Brookfield State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 36 Boscombe Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 506 students with 43 teachers (33 full-time equivalent) and 18 non-teaching staff (13 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. There are no secondary schools in Brookfield. The nearest secondary schools are in neighbouring Kenmore. Demographics In the , Brookfield recorded a population of 3,524 people. The median age of the Brookfield population was 46 years of age, 8 years above the Australian median. 68.3% of people were born in Australia., compared to the national average of 66.7%; were England 6.7% and South Africa 4.5%. 85.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 26.7%, Catholic 21.5% and Anglican 19.1%.

It was released for the PlayStation on December 31, 1998, in North America and February 1999 in Europe. The game received mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Plot The game centres on the voodoo priest and warrior Akuji (voiced by Richard Roundtree), who had his heart ripped out on his wedding day, and through the use of voodoo magic is now cursed to wander the Underworld. However, Kesho (voiced by Jamesetta Bunn), his would-be bride, finds him in hell and speaks to him in soul form: she informs him that it was Orad, Akuji's own brother, who orchestrated his murder. She begs Akuji to escape and stop him, as their families are preparing for war, and Orad is preparing to sacrifice her to the gods. Upon traveling through the first level of the Underworld and consulting loa Baron Samedi (voiced by Petri Hawkins-Byrd) Akuji discovers he has a chance for redemption: if he traverses hell and collects the souls of his ancestors, which the Baron despises for their evil, then he will grant Akuji safe passage out of the underworld. On his way through, he must also defeat the wardens of each of the vestibules of hell, which will enable him to advance on his quest for the souls. Eventually, after Akuji retrieves the Seal of Sadiki, the Baron steals it from him and reveals he'd tricked Akuji into collecting the souls of his ancestors so it would allow him to break free of his own imprisonment in the Underworld and exact his revenge on the mortal world while also making Kesho his servant once he sacrifices her. Kesho further confirms that the Baron had orchestrated Akuji's murder by possessing Orad and had also earlier used her voice to lead Akuji to him. Akuji engages the Baron in one last battle and succeeds, rescuing Kesho who in turn restores Akuji's heart, sending them back to the mortal world. Development Akuji the Heartless was built on the Gex: Enter the Gecko game engine. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Crystal Dynamics has certainly provided gamers with a solid action title with enough imagination to please those who possess a penchant for the macabre. Yet the rough controls and animations keep Akuji from truly stepping into the genre's limelight.\\" The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

Andre was raised in Kingston, Ontario. He studied at McGill University (Honors English, B.A., 1968), the University of Chicago (M.A., 1969) and Columbia University (PhD, English and Comparative Literature, 1973). Andre hosted radio shows in Chicago and New York. He interviewed, published, and occasionally socialized with W. H. Auden and Eugene McCarthy, Beats like Gregory Corso, William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and homosexual esthetes like John Cage and Andy Warhol. He is divorced from Erika Rothenberg, an artist, and Jane Adler, a flautist and sign-language interpreter; he has a son, Benjamin Eyton Andre. Papers may be found at the University of Tulsa and at Yale University. Andre is the editor of Unmuzzled OX, an occasional magazine of poetry, art and politics which began in 1971 as a quarterly and has produced 16 volumes. Andre edited and published two books by Gregory Corso, Earth Egg and Writings from OX. His opera, Orfreo, with music by Elodie Lauten, premiered at Merkin Hall in 2004. The two also collaborated on Sex and Pre- anti-post-modernism and S.O.S. W.T.C.

A primary subclade of Haplogroup R (R-M207), it is defined by the SNP M173. The other primary subclade of Haplogroup R is Haplogroup R2 (R-M479). Males carrying R-M173 in modern populations appear to comprise two subclades: R1a and R1b, which are found mainly in populations native to Eurasia (except East and Southeast Asia). R-M173 contains the majority of representatives of haplogroup R in the form of its subclades, R1a and R1b (, , and ). Karafet et al.

It and its sibling clade R2 (R-M79) are the only immediate descendants of Haplogroup R (R-M207). R is a direct descendant of Haplogroup P1 (P-M45), and a sibling clade, therefore, of Haplogroup Q (Q-M242). There were few areas in which Haplogroups P-M45, Q-M242 and R-M207 were all common amongst prehistoric populations. R-M207 and its subclades were most common along an axis from Western Europe to South Asia, whereas Q-M242 was the most common Y-DNA lineage among Native Americans. However, both P-M45 and its immediate descendants also appear to have been relatively common in Central Asia and Siberia. Based on its ancestral lineages, an inferred origin for haplogroup R1 is South Asia or its western neighboring areas. For example, believes the evidence \\"suggests that southern and western Asia might be the source of this haplogroup\\" and that \\"given the geographic spread and STR diversities of sister clades R1 and R2, the latter of which is restricted to India, Pakistan, Iran, and southern central Asia, it is possible that southern and western Asia were the source for R1 and R1a differentiation.\\" felt in their review of the literature, that the case for South Asian origins is strongest, with the Central Asian origin argued by being also worthy of consideration. Karafet et al. (2014) \\"rapid diversification process of K-M526 likely occurred in Southeast Asia, with subsequent westward expansions of the ancestors of haplogroups R and Q.\\" General distribution=Eurasia Haplogroup R1 is very common throughout all of Eurasia except East Asia and Southeast Asia. Its distribution is believed to be associated with the re-settlement of Eurasia following the Last Glacial Maximum. Its main subgroups are R1a and R1b. One subclade of haplogroup R1b (especially R1b1a2), is the most common haplogroup in Western Europe and Bashkortostan , while a subclade of haplogroup R1a (especially haplogroup R1a1) is the most common haplogroup in large parts of South Asia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Western China, and South Siberia. Individuals whose Y-chromosomes possess all the mutations on internal nodes of the Y-DNA tree down to and including M207 (which defines Haplogroup R) but which display neither the M173 mutation that defines haplogroup R1 nor the M479 mutation that defines Haplogroup R2 are categorized as belonging to group R* (R-M207). R* has been found in 10.3% (10/97) of a sample of Burusho and 6.8% (3/44) of a sample of Kalash from northern Pakistan . Americas The presence of haplogroup R1 among Indigenous Americans groups is a matter of controversy. It is now the most common haplogroup after the various Q-M242, especially in North America in Ojibwe people at 79%, Chipewyan 62%, Seminole 50%, Cherokee 47%, Dogrib 40% and Tohono O'odham 38%. Some authorities point to the greater similarity between haplogroup R1 subclades found in North America and those found in Siberia (e.g. Lell and Raghavan ), suggesting prehistoric immigration from Asia and/or Beringia. Africa One subclade, now known as R1b1a2 (R-V88), is found only at high frequencies amongst populations native to West Africa, such as the Fulani, and is believed to reflect a prehistoric back-migration from Eurasia to Africa. Subclade distribution=R1a (R-M420) The split of R1a (M420) is computed to ca 25,000 years ago (95% CI: 21, 300‚Äì29, 000 BP), or roughly the last glacial maximum. A large study performed in 2014 (Underhill et al. 2015), using 16,244 individuals from over 126 populations from across Eurasia, concluded that there was compelling evidence that \\"the initial episodes of haplogroup R1a diversification likely occurred in the vicinity of present-day Iran.\\" The subclade M417 (R1a1a1) diversified ca. 5,800 years ago. The distribution of M417-subclades R1-Z282 (including R1-Z280) in Central- and Eastern Europe and R1-Z93 in Asia suggests that R1a1a diversified within the Eurasian Steppes or the Middle East and Caucasus region. The place of origin of these subclades plays a role in the debate about the origins of the Indo-Europeans. High frequencies of haplogroup R1a are found amongst West Bengal Brahmins (72%), and Uttar Pradesh Brahmins, (67%), the Ishkashimi (68%), the Tajik population of Panjikent (64%), the Kyrgyz population of Central Kyrgyzstan (63.5%), Sorbs (63.39%), Bihar Brahmins (60.53%), Shors (58.8%),Miroslava Derenko et al 2005, Contrasting patterns of Y-chromosome variation in South Siberian populations from Baikal and Altai-Sayan regions Poles (56.4%), Teleuts (55.3%), South Altaians (58.1%), Ukrainians (50%) and Russians (50%) (, , , and ). R1b (R-M343) Haplogroup R1b probably originated in Eurasia prior to or during the last glaciation. It is the most common haplogroup in Western Europe and Bashkortostan. It may have survived the last glacial maximum, in refugia near the southern Ural Mountains and Aegean Sea.. It is also present at lower frequencies throughout Eastern Europe, with higher diversity than in western Europe, suggesting an ancient migration of haplogroup R1b from the east. Haplogroup R1b is also found at various frequencies in many different populations near the Ural Mountains and Central Asia, its likely region of origin. There may be a correlation between this haplogroup and the spread of Centum branch Indo-European languages in southern and western Europe. For instance, the modern incidence of R1b reaches between 60% and 90% of the male population in most parts of Spain, Portugal, France, Britain and Ireland. The clade is also found at frequencies of up to 90% in the Chad Basin, and is also present in North Africa, where its frequency surpasses 10% in some parts of Algeria. Although it is rare in South Asia, some populations show relatively high percentages for R1b. These include Lambadi showing 37% , Hazara 32% , and Agharia (in East India) at 30% . Besides these, R1b has appeared in Balochi (8%), Bengalis (6.5%), Chenchu (2%), Makrani (5%), Newars (10.6%), Pallan (3.5%) and Punjabis (7.6%) (, , and ). R-M343 (previously called Hg1 and Eu18) is the most frequent Y-chromosome haplogroup in Europe. It is an offshoot of R-M173, characterised by the M343 marker.Note that in earlier literature the M269 marker, rather than M343, was used to define the \\"R1b\\" haplogroup. Then, for a time (from 2003 to 2005) what is now R1b1c was designated R1b3. An overwhelming majority of members of R-M343 are classified as R-P25 (defined by the P25 marker), the remainder as R-M343*. Its frequency is highest in Western Europe (and due to modern European immigration, in parts of the Americas). The majority of R-M343-carriers of European descent belong to the R-M269 (R1b1a2) descendant line. In popular culture A fictional animation by Artem Lukichev links the history of R1, R1a and R1b to a traditional epic of the Bashkir people of the Ural Mountains.

In 1867 he obtained his PhD in classical philology, afterwards teaching at the Thomasschule of Leipzig (1867‚Äì1870). In the meantime, he completed his habilitation in Sanskrit and comparative linguistics at the university (1869). In 1870‚Äì71 he worked as a staff member of the India Office Library in London. Later on, he became a professor of comparative linguistics at Heidelberg University (1872) and the University of Strasbourg (1875). In 1877 he returned to his alma mater in Leipzig as a professor of Sanskrit and director of the Indo-Europeanist institute. In the academic year of 1895/96, he served as rector. Among his students were Friedrich Delitzsch as well as Anna Leonowens who attended his Sanskrit lectures from 1897 to 1901.

Plutonium and uranium in grades normally used in nuclear weapons are the most common examples. (These nuclear materials have other categorizations based on their purity.) Only fissile isotopes of certain elements have the potential for use in nuclear weapons. For such use, the concentration of fissile isotopes uranium-235 and plutonium-239 in the element used must be sufficiently high. Uranium from natural sources is enriched by isotope separation, and plutonium is produced in a suitable nuclear reactor. Experiments have been conducted with uranium-233. Neptunium-237 and some isotopes of americium might be usable, but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented. Critical mass  Any weapons-grade nuclear material must have a critical mass that is small enough to justify its use in a weapon. The critical mass for any material is the smallest amount needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This is, of course, infinite for any material that is not radioactive. Moreover, different isotopes have different critical masses, and the critical mass for many radioactive isotopes is infinite, because the mode of decay of one atom cannot induce similar decay of more than one neighboring atom. For example, the critical mass of uranium-238 is infinite, while the critical masses of uranium-233 and uranium-235 are finite. The critical mass for any isotope is influenced by any impurities and the physical shape of the material. The shape with minimal critical mass and the smallest physical dimensions is a sphere. Bare-sphere critical masses at normal density of some actinides are listed in the accompanying table. Most information on bare sphere masses is classified, but some documents have been declassified.Reevaluated Critical Specifications of Some Los Alamos Fast-Neutron Systems Countries that have produced weapons-grade nuclear material Ten countries have produced weapons-grade nuclear material: * Five recognized \\"nuclear-weapon states\\" under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT): the United States (first nuclear weapon tested and two bombs used as weapons in 1945), Russia (first weapon tested in 1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), and China (1964) * Three other declared nuclear states that are not signatories of the NPT: India (not a signatory, weapon tested in 1974), Pakistan (not a signatory, weapon tested in 1998), and North Korea (withdrew from the NPT in 2003, weapon tested in 2006) * Israel, which is widely known to have developed nuclear weapons (likely first tested in the 1960s or 1970s) but has not openly declared its capability * South Africa, which also had enrichment capabilities and developed nuclear weapons (possibly tested in 1979), but disassembled its arsenal and joined the NPT in 1991 Weapons-grade uranium Natural uranium is made weapons-grade through isotopic enrichment. Initially only about 0.7% of it is fissile U-235, with the rest being almost entirely uranium-238 (U-238). They are separated by their differing masses. Highly enriched uranium is considered weapons-grade when it has been enriched to about 90% U-235. U-233 is produced from thorium-232 by neutron capture. The U-233 produced thus does not require enrichment and can be relatively easily chemically separated from residual Th-232. It is therefore regulated as a special nuclear material only by the total amount present. U-233 may be intentionally down-blended with U-238 to remove proliferation concerns.Definition of Weapons-Usable Uranium-233 ORNL/TM-13517 While U-233 would thus seem ideal for weaponization, a significant obstacle to that goal is the co-production of trace amounts of uranium-232 due to side-reactions. U-232 hazards, a result of its highly radioactive decay products such as thallium-208, are significant even at 5 parts per million. Implosion nuclear weapons require U-232 levels below 50 PPM (above which the U-233 is considered \\"low grade\\"; cf. \\"Standard weapon grade plutonium requires a Pu-240 content of no more than 6.5%.\\" which is 65,000 PPM, and the analogous Pu-238 was produced in levels of 0.5% (5000 PPM) or less). Gun-type fission weapons would require low U-232 levels and low levels of light impurities on the order of 1 PPM.Nuclear Materials FAQ Weapons- grade plutonium Pu-239 is produced artificially in nuclear reactors when a neutron is absorbed by U-238, forming U-239, which then decays in a rapid two- step process into Pu-239. It can then be separated from the uranium in a nuclear reprocessing plant. Weapons-grade plutonium is defined as being predominantly Pu-239, typically about 93% Pu-239. Pu-240 is produced when Pu-239 absorbs an additional neutron and fails to fission. Pu-240 and Pu-239 are not separated by reprocessing. Pu-240 has a high rate of spontaneous fission, which can cause a nuclear weapon to pre-detonate. This makes plutonium unsuitable for use in gun-type nuclear weapons. To reduce the concentration of Pu-240 in the plutonium produced, weapons program plutonium production reactors (e.g. B Reactor) irradiate the uranium for a far shorter time than is normal for a nuclear power reactor. More precisely, weapons-grade plutonium is obtained from uranium irradiated to a low burnup. This represents a fundamental difference between these two types of reactor. In a nuclear power station, high burnup is desirable. Power stations such as the obsolete British Magnox and French UNGG reactors, which were designed to produce either electricity or weapons material, were operated at low power levels with frequent fuel changes using online refuelling to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Such operation is not possible with the light water reactors most commonly used to produce electric power. In these the reactor must be shut down and the pressure vessel disassembled to gain access to the irradiated fuel. Plutonium recovered from LWR spent fuel, while not weapons grade, can be used to produce nuclear weapons at all levels of sophistication, though in simple designs it may produce only a fizzle yield. Weapons made with reactor- grade plutonium would require special cooling to keep them in storage and ready for use. A 1962 test at the U.S. Nevada National Security Site (then known as the Nevada Proving Grounds) used non-weapons-grade plutonium produced in a Magnox reactor in the United Kingdom. The plutonium used was provided to the United States under the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. Its isotopic composition has not been disclosed, other than the description reactor grade and it has not been disclosed which definition was used in describing the material this way. The plutonium was apparently sourced from the military Magnox reactors at Calder Hall or Chapelcross. The content of Pu-239 in material used for the 1962 test was not disclosed, but has been inferred to have been at least 85%, much higher than typical spent fuel from currently operating reactors. Occasionally, low-burnup spent fuel has been produced by a commercial LWR when an incident such as a fuel cladding failure has required early refuelling. If the period of irradiation has been sufficiently short, this spent fuel could be reprocessed to produce weapons grade plutonium.

Garin was born in Ryazan as Erast Gerasimov. He started his acting career in 1919 in an amateur theatre of the Ryazan military district. In 1926 he finished his education in the experimental theatrical workshops of the People's Commissariat for Education.

They are large songbirds, being between in length. Their colour ranges from black-and-white to mostly black with added grey plumage, depending on the species. They have a large, straight bill with a distinctive hook at the end which is used to skewer prey. They have high-pitched complex songs, which are used to defend their essentially year-round group territories: unlike birds of extratropical Eurasia and the Americas, both sexes sing prolifically.Johnson Gayle; \\"Vocalizations in the Grey Butcherbird Cracticus torquatus with Emphasis on Structure in Male Breeding Song: Implications for the Function and Evolution of Song from a Study of a Southern Hemisphere Species\\"; PhD Doctorate; Griffith University, 2003 Taxonomy The genus Cracticus was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with the hooded butcherbird (Cracticus cassicus) as the type species. The name is from the Ancient Greek kraktikos meaning \\"noisy\\" or \\"clamorous\\". Together with three species of currawong (Strepera) and two species of Peltops, the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi), and the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), they form the subfamily Cracticinae within the family Artamidae. The genus contains six species: rhinoceros beetle * Grey butcherbird, Cracticus torquatus * Silver-backed butcherbird Cracticus argenteus (alternately a subspecies of C. torquatus) * Hooded butcherbird, Cracticus cassicus * Tagula butcherbird, Cracticus louisiadensis * Black-backed butcherbird, Cracticus mentalis * Pied butcherbird, Cracticus nigrogularis The black butcherbird, Melloria quoyi, is sometimes called Cracticus quoyi. Biology They are insect eaters for the most part, but will also feed on small lizards and other vertebrates. They get their name from their habit of impaling captured prey on a thorn, tree fork, or crevice. This \\"larder\\" is used to support the victim while it is being eaten, to store prey for later consumption, or to attract mates. They are the ecological counterparts of the shrikes, mainly found in Eurasia and Africa, which are only distantly related, but share the \\"larder\\" habit; shrikes are also sometimes called \\"butcherbirds\\". They live in a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to arid shrubland. Like many similar species, they have adapted well to urbanisation and can be found in leafy suburbs throughout Australia. They are opportunistic, showing little fear and readily taking food offerings to the point of becoming semi-tame. Females lay between two and five eggs in a clutch,Jetz, Walter; Sekercioƒülu, Cagan H. and B√∂hning-G√§se, Katrin; \\"The Worldwide Variation in Avian Clutch Size across Species and Space\\" Supplementary Material S4 with the larger clutch sizes in more open-country species.

Coaxial cavity RF filter at 2 meter repeater An amateur radio repeater is an electronic device that receives a weak or low-level amateur radio signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. Many repeaters are located on hilltops or on tall buildings as the higher location increases their coverage area, sometimes referred to as the radio horizon, or \\"footprint\\". Amateur radio repeaters are similar in concept to those used by public safety entities (police, fire department, etc.), businesses, government, military, and more. Amateur radio repeaters may even use commercially packaged repeater systems that have been adjusted to operate within amateur radio frequency bands, but more often amateur repeaters are assembled from receivers, transmitters, controllers, power supplies, antennas, and other components, from various sources.  Introduction  In amateur radio, repeaters are typically maintained by individual hobbyists or local groups of amateur radio operators. Many repeaters are provided openly to other amateur radio operators and typically not used as a remote base station by a single user or group. In some areas multiple repeaters are linked together to form a wide-coverage network, such as the linked system provided by the Independent Repeater Associationhttp://w8ira.org Independent Repeater Association which covers most of western Michigan, or the Western Intertie Network System (\\"WINsystem\\") that now covers a great deal of California, and is in 17 other states, including Hawaii, along with parts of four other countries, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.http://www.winsystem.org A series of linked, or Intertied, UHF (440 MHz, or 70 cm) repeaters  Frequencies  Repeaters are found mainly in the VHF 6 meter (50‚Äì54 MHz), 2 meter (144‚Äì148 MHz), 1.25-meter band (1 meters) (220‚Äì225 MHz) and the UHF 70 centimeter (420‚Äì450 MHz) bands, but can be used on almost any frequency pair above 28 MHz. In some areas, 33 centimeters (902‚Äì928 MHz) and 23 centimeters (1.24‚Äì1.3 GHz) are also used for repeaters. Note that different countries have different rules; for example, in the United States, the two meter band is 144‚Äì148 MHz, while in the United Kingdom (and most of Europe) it is 144‚Äì146 MHz. Repeater frequency sets are known as \\"repeater pairs\\", and in the ham radio community most follow ad hoc standards for the difference between the two frequencies, commonly called the offset. In the USA two-meter band, the standard offset is 600 kHz (0.6 MHz), but sometimes unusual offsets, referred to as oddball splits, are used. The actual frequency pair used is assigned by a local frequency coordinating council. In the days of crystal-controlled radios, these pairs were identified by the last portion of the transmit (Input) frequency followed by the last portion of the receive (Output) frequency that the ham would put into the radio. Thus \\"three-four nine-four\\" (34/94) meant that hams would transmit on 146.34 MHz and listen on 146.94 MHz (while the repeater would do the opposite, listening on 146.34 and transmitting on 146.94). In areas with many repeaters, \\"reverse splits\\" were common (i.e., 94/34), to prevent interference between systems. Since the late 1970s, the use of synthesized, microprocessor-controlled radios, and widespread adoption of standard frequency splits have changed the way repeater pairs are described. In 1980, a ham might have been told that a repeater was on \\"22/82\\"‚Äîtoday they will most often be told \\"682 down\\". The 6 refers to the last digit of 146 MHz, so that the display will read \\"146.82\\" (the output frequency), and the radio is set to transmit \\"down\\" 600 kHz on 146.22 MHz. Another way of describing a repeater frequency pair is to give the repeater's output frequency, along with the direction of offset (\\"+\\" or \\"plus\\" for an input frequency above the output frequency, \\"‚àí\\" or \\"minus\\" for a lower frequency) with the assumption that the repeater uses the standard offset for the band in question. For instance, a 2-meter repeater might be described as \\"147.34 with a plus offset\\", meaning that the repeater transmits on 147.34 MHz and receives on 147.94 MHz, 600 kHz above the output frequency.  Services  Services provided by a repeater may include an autopatch connection to a POTS/PSTN telephone line to allow users to make telephone calls from their keypad-equipped radios. These advanced services may be limited to members of the group or club that maintains the repeater. Many amateur radio repeaters typically have a tone access control (CTCSS, also called CG or PL tone) implemented to prevent them from being keyed-up (operated) accidentally by interference from other radio signals. A few use a digital code system called DCS, DCG or DPL (a Motorola trademark). In the UK most repeaters also respond to a short burst of 1750 Hz tone to open the repeater. In many communities, a repeater has become a major on-the-air gathering spot for the local amateur radio community, especially during \\"drive time\\" (the morning or afternoon commuting time). In the evenings local public service nets may be heard on these systems and many repeaters are used by weather spotters. In an emergency or a disaster a repeater can sometimes help to provide needed communications between areas that could not otherwise communicate. Until cellular telephones became popular, it was common for community repeaters to have \\"drive time\\" monitoring stations so that mobile amateurs could call in traffic accidents via the repeater to the monitoring station who could relay it to the local police agencies via telephone. Systems with autopatches frequently had (and still have) most of the public safety agencies numbers programmed as speed- dial numbers.  US repeater coordination  Repeater coordination is not required by the Federal Communications Commission, nor does the FCC regulate, certify or otherwise regulate frequency coordination for the Amateur Radio Bands. Amateur Radio Repeater Coordinators or coordination groups are all volunteers and have no legal authority to assume jurisdictional or regional control in any area where the Federal Communications Commission regulates the Amateur Radio Service. The United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 CFR, Part 97, which are the laws in which the Amateur Radio Service is regulated clearly states the definition of Frequency Coordinator. The purpose of coordinating a repeater or frequency is to reduce harmful interference to other fixed operations. Coordinating a repeater or frequency with other fixed operations demonstrates good engineering and amateur practice.  UK repeaters  In the UK, the frequency allocations for repeaters are managed by the Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee (ETCC) of the Radio Society of Great Britain and licensed by Ofcom, the industry regulator for communications in the UK. Each repeater has a NOV (Notice of Variation) licence issued to a particular amateur radio callsign (this person is normally known as the \\"repeater keeper\\") thus ensuring the licensing authority has a single point of contact for that particular repeater. Each repeater in the UK is normally supported by a repeater group composed of local amateur radio enthusiasts who pay a nominal amount e.g. ¬£10‚Äì15 a year each to support the maintenance of each repeater and to pay for site rents, electricity costs etc. Repeater groups do not receive any central funding from other organisations. Such groups include the Central Scotland FM Grouphttp://www.csfmg.com Central Scotland FM Group and the Scottish Borders Repeater Group.http://www.sbrg.co.uk Scottish Borders Repeater Group  Repeater equipment  2 Meter GE Mastr II repeater The most basic repeater consists of an FM receiver on one frequency and an FM transmitter on another frequency usually in the same radio band, connected together so that when the receiver picks up a signal, the transmitter is keyed and rebroadcasts whatever is heard. In order to run the repeater a repeater controller is necessary. A repeater controller can be a hardware solution or even be implemented in software.http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/svxlink/ SVX Link - A software solution for building repeaters. Repeaters typically have a timer to cut off retransmission of a signal that goes too long. Repeaters operated by groups with an emphasis on emergency communications often limit each transmission to 30 seconds, while others may allow three minutes or even longer. The timer restarts after a short pause following each transmission, and many systems feature a beep or chirp tone to signal that the timeout timer has reset.  Repeater types = Conventional repeaters  Conventional repeaters, also known as in-band or same-band repeaters, retransmit signals within the same frequency band, and they only repeat signals using a particular modulation scheme, predominately FM. Standard repeaters require either the use of two antennas (one each for transmitter and receiver) or a duplexer to isolate the transmit and receive signals over a single antenna. The duplexer is a device which prevents the repeater's high-power transmitter (on the output frequency) from drowning out the users' signal on the repeater receiver (on the input frequency). A diplexer allows two transmitters on different frequencies to use one antenna, and is common in installations where one repeater on 2 m and a second on 440 MHz share one feedline up the tower and one antenna. Most repeaters are remotely controlled through the use of audio tones on a control channel.  Cross-band repeaters  A cross-band repeater (also sometimes called a replexer), is a repeater that retransmits a specific mode on a frequency in one band to a specific mode on a frequency in a different band. This technique allows for a smaller and less complex repeater system. Repeating signals across widely separated frequency bands allows for simple filters to be used to allow one antenna to be used for both transmit and receive at the same time. This avoids the use of complex duplexers to achieve the required rejection for same band repeating. Some dual-band amateur transceivers are capable of cross-band repeat.  Amateur television repeaters  Amateur television (ATV) repeaters are used by amateur radio operators to transmit full motion video. The bands used by ATV repeaters vary by country, but in the US a typical configuration is as a cross-band system with an input on the 33 or 23 cm band and output on 421.25 MHz or, sometimes, 426.25 MHz (within the 70 cm band). These output frequencies happen to be the same as standard cable television channels 57 and 58, meaning that anyone with a cable-ready analog NTSC TV can tune them in without special equipment. There are also digital amateur TV repeaters that retransmit digital video signals. Frequently DVB-S modulation is used for digital ATV, due to narrow bandwidth needs and high loss tolerances. These DATV repeaters are more prevalent in Europe currently, partially because of the availability of DVB-S equipment.  Satellite repeaters  In addition, amateur radio satellites have been launched with the specific purpose of operating as space-borne amateur repeaters. The worldwide amateur satellite organization AMSAT designs and builds many of the amateur satellites, which are also known as OSCARs. Several satellites with amateur radio equipment on board have been designed and built by universities around the world. Also, several OSCARs have been built for experimentation. For example, NASA and AMSAT coordinated the release of SuitSat which was an attempt to make a low cost experimental satellite from a discarded Russian spacesuit outfitted with amateur radio equipment. The repeaters on board a satellite may be of any type; the key distinction is that they are in orbit around the Earth, rather than terrestrial in nature. The three most common types of OSCARs are linear transponders, cross-band FM repeaters, and digipeaters (also referred to as pacsats).  Linear transponders  Amateur transponder repeaters are most commonly used on amateur satellites. A specified band of frequencies, usually having a bandwidth of 20 to 800 kHz is repeated from one band to another. Transponders are not mode specific and typically no demodulation occurs. Any signal with a bandwidth narrower than the transponder's pass-band will be repeated; however, for technical reasons, use of modes other than SSB and CW are discouraged. Transponders may be inverting or non-inverting. An example of an inverting transponder would be a 70cm to 2m transponder which receives on the 432.000 MHz to 432.100 MHz frequencies and transmits on the 146.000 MHz to 146.100 MHz frequencies by inverting the frequency range within the band. In this example, a signal received at 432.001 MHz would be transmitted on 146.099 MHz. Voice signals using upper sideband modulation on the input would result in a LSB modulation on the output, and vice versa.  Store-and-forward systems  Another class of repeaters do not simultaneously retransmit a signal, on different frequency, as they receive it. Instead, they operate in a store-and- forward manner, by receiving and then retransmitting on the same frequency after a short delay. These systems may not be legally classified as \\"repeaters\\", depending on the definition set by a country's regulator. For example, in the US, the FCC defines a repeater as an \\"amateur station that simultaneously retransmits the transmission of another amateur station on a different channel or channels.\\" (CFR 47 97.205(b)) Store-and-forward systems neither retransmit simultaneously, nor use a different channel. Thus, they must be operated under different rules than more conventional repeaters. = Simplex repeater = A type of system known as a simplex repeater uses a single transceiver and a short-duration voice recorder, which records whatever the receiver picks up for a set length of time (usually 30 seconds or less), then plays back the recording over the transmitter on the same frequency. A common name is a \\"parrot\\" repeater. = Digipeater = Another form of repeater used in amateur packet radio, a form of digital computer-to-computer communications, is dubbed \\"digipeater\\" (for DIGItal rePEATER). Digipeaters are often used for activities and modes such as packet radio, Automatic Packet Reporting System, and D-STAR's digital data mode. Also commercial digital modes such as DMR, P25 and NXDN. Some modes are full duplex and internet linked. = SSTV repeater = An SSTV repeater is an amateur radio repeater station that relays slow-scan television signals. A typical SSTV repeater is equipped with a HF or VHF transceiver and a computer with a sound card, which serves as a demodulator/modulator of SSTV signals. SSTV repeaters are used by amateur radio operators for exchanging pictures. If two stations cannot copy each other, they can still communicate through a repeater. One type of SSTV repeater is activated by a station sending it a 1,750 Hz tone. The repeater sends K in morse code to confirm its activation, after which the station must start sending a picture within about 10 seconds. After reception, the received image is transmitted on the repeater's operation frequency. Another type is activated by the SSTV vertical synchronization signal (VIS code). Depending on the software it uses (MMSSTV, JVComm32, MSCAN, for example), an SSTV repeater typically operates in common SSTV modes.  Repeater networks  Repeaters may be linked together in order to form what is known as a linked repeater system or linked repeater network. In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal. The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability. Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional repeaters and links on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with DTMF tones to control the network infrastructure. Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart. These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in Skywarn nets, where storm spotters relay severe weather reports. All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.  Voting systems  In order to get better receive coverage over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with what is known as a voted receiver system. In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on). All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting selector panel that switches from receiver to receiver based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter. A properly adjusted voting system can switch many times a second and can actually \\"assemble\\" a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise would not be able to key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue. Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.  Internet linking  Repeaters may also be connected over the Internet using voice over IP (VoIP) techniques. VoIP links are a convenient way to connecting distant repeaters that would otherwise be unreachable by VHF/UHF radio propagation. Popular VoIP amateur radio network protocols include D-STAR, Echolink, IRLP, WIRES and eQSO. Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), D-STAR, Fusion, P25 and NXDN all have a codec in the user radio and along with the encoded audio, also send and receive user number and destination information so one can talk to another specific user or a Talk Group. Two such worldwide networks are DMR-MARC and Brandmeister. For example, a simplex gateway may be used to link a simplex repeater into a repeater network via the Internet.  Operating terms  * Timing Out is the situation where a person talks too long and the repeater timer shuts off the repeater transmitter. * Kerchunking is transmitting a momentary signal to check a repeater without identifying. In many countries, such an act violates amateur radio regulations. The term \\"Kerchunk\\" can also apply to the sound a large FM transmitter makes when the operator switches it off and on. * Lid refers to a poor operator (radio methods) usually from improper training from other Amateurs or exposure to different types of operation such as CB radio.

A repeater sited at a high elevation can allow two mobile stations, otherwise out of line-of-sight propagation range of each other, to communicate. Repeaters are found in professional, commercial, and government mobile radio systems and also in amateur radio. Repeater systems use two different radio frequencies; the mobiles transmit on one frequency, and the repeater station receives those transmission and transmits on a second frequency. Since the repeater must transmit at the same time as the signal is being received, and may even use the same antenna for both transmitting and receiving, frequency-selective filters are required to prevent the receiver from being overloaded by the transmitted signal. Some repeaters use two different frequency bands to provide isolation between input and output or as a convenience. In a communications satellite, a transponder serves a similar function, but the transponder does not necessarily demodulate the relayed signals. iDEN digital trunked system repeater at a cell site. Full duplex operation Motorola MOTOTRBO Repeater DR3000 with duplexer mounted in Flightcase, 100% Duty cycle up to 40 W output A repeater is an automatic radio-relay station, usually located on a mountain top, tall building, or radio tower. It allows communication between two or more bases, mobile or portable stations that are unable to communicate directly with each other due to distance or obstructions between them. The repeater receives on one radio frequency (the \\"input\\" frequency), demodulates the signal, and simultaneously re-transmits the information on its \\"output\\" frequency. All stations using the repeater transmit on the repeater's input frequency and receive on its output frequency. Since the repeater is usually located at an elevation higher than the other radios using it, their range is greatly extended. 200px Because the transmitter and receiver are on at the same time, isolation must exist to keep the repeater's own transmitter from degrading the repeater receiver. If the repeater transmitter and receiver are not isolated well, the repeater's own transmitter desensitizes the repeater receiver. The problem is similar to being at a rock concert and not being able to hear the weak signal of a conversation over the much stronger signal of the band. In general, isolating the receiver from the transmitter is made easier by maximizing, as much as possible, the separation between input and output frequencies. When operating through a repeater, mobile stations must transmit on a different frequency than the repeater output. Although the repeater site must be capable of simultaneous reception and transmission (on two different frequencies), mobile stations can operate in one mode at a time, alternating between receiving and transmitting; so, mobile stations do not need the bulky, and costly filters required at a repeater site. Mobile stations may have an option to select a \\"talk around\\" mode to transmit and receive on the same frequency; this is sometimes used for local communication within range of the mobile units. Frequency separation: input to output There is no set rule about spacing of input and output frequencies for all radio repeaters. Any spacing where the designer can get sufficient isolation between receiver and transmitter will work. In some countries, under some radio services, there are agreed-on conventions or separations that are required by the system license. In the case of input and output frequencies in the United States, for example: * Amateur repeaters in the 144‚Äì148 MHz band usually use a 600 kHz (0.6 MHz) separation, in the 1.25-meter band use a 1.6 MHz separation, in the 420‚Äì450 MHz band use a 5 MHz separation, and in the 902‚Äì928 MHz band use a 25 MHz separation. * Systems in the 450‚Äì470 MHz band use a 5 MHz separation with the input on the higher frequency. Example: input is 456.900 MHz; output is 451.900 MHz. * Systems in the 806‚Äì869 MHz band use a 45 MHz separation with the input on the lower frequency. Example: input is 810.1875 MHz; output is 855.1875 MHz. * Military systems are suggested to use no less than a 10 MHz spacing.http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/policy/army/fm/24-18/fm24-18_9.htm These are just a few examples. There are many other separations or spacings between input and output frequencies in operational systems. Same band frequencies Same band repeaters operate with input and output frequencies in the same frequency band. For example, in US two-way radio, 30‚Äì50 MHz is one band and 150‚Äì174 MHz is another. A repeater with an input of 33.980 MHz and an output of 46.140 MHz is a same band repeater. In same band repeaters, a central design problem is keeping the repeater's own transmitter from interfering with the receiver. Reducing the coupling between transmitter and input frequency receiver is called isolation. =Duplexer system= 200pxIn same-band repeaters, isolation between transmitter and receiver can be created by using a single antenna and a device called a duplexer. The device is a tuned filter connected to the antenna. In this example, consider a type of device called a band-pass duplexer. It allows, or passes, a band, (or a narrow range,) of frequencies. There are two legs to the duplexer filter, one is tuned to pass the input frequency, the other is tuned to pass the output frequency. Both legs of the filter are coupled to the antenna. The repeater receiver is connected to the receive leg while the transmitter is connected to the transmit leg. The duplexer prevents degradation of the receiver sensitivity by the transmitter in two ways. First, the receive leg greatly attenuates the transmitter's carrier at the receiver input (typically by 90-100 dB), preventing the carrier from overloading (blocking) the receiver front end. Second, the transmit leg attenuates the transmitter broadband noise on the receiver frequency, also typically by 90-100 dB. By virtue of the transmitter and receiver being on different frequencies, they can operate at the same time on a single antenna. =Combining system= There is often not enough tower space to accommodate a separate antenna for each repeater at crowded equipment sites. In same-band repeaters at engineered, shared equipment sites, repeaters can be connected to shared antenna systems. These are common in trunked systems, where up to 29 repeaters for a single trunked system may be located at the same site. (Some architectures such as iDEN sites may have more than 29 repeaters.) In a shared system, a receive antenna is usually located at the top of the antenna tower. Putting the receive antenna at the top helps to capture weaker received signals than if the receive antenna were lower of the two. By splitting the received signal from the antenna, many receivers can work satisfactorily from a single antenna. Devices called receiver multicouplers split the signal from the antenna into many receiver connections. The multicoupler amplifies the signals reaching the antenna, then feeds them to several receivers, attempting to make up for losses in the power dividers (or splitters). These operate similarly to a cable TV splitter but must be built to higher quality standards so they work in environments where strong interfering signals are present. On the transmitter side, a second transmit antenna is installed somewhere below the receive antenna. There is an electrical relationship defined by the distance between transmit and receive antennas. A desirable null exists if the transmit antenna is located exactly below the receive antenna beyond a minimum distance. Almost the same isolation as a low-grade duplexer (about ‚àí60 decibels) can be accomplished by installing the transmit antenna below, and along the centerline of, the receive antenna. Several transmitters can be connected to the same antenna using filters called combiners. Transmitters usually have directional devices installed along with the filters that block any reflected power in the event the antenna malfunctions. The antenna must have a power rating that will handle the sum of energy of all connected transmitters at the same time. Transmitter combining systems are lossy. As a rule of thumb, each leg of the combiner has a 50% (3 decibel) power loss. If two transmitters are connected to a single antenna through a combiner, half of their power will reach the combiner output. (This assumes everything is working properly.) If four transmitters are coupled to one antenna, a quarter of each transmitter's power will reach the output of the combining circuit. Part of this loss can be made up with increased antenna gain. Fifty watts of transmitter power to the antenna will make a received signal strength at a distant mobile radio that is almost identical to 100 watts. In trunked systems with many channels, a site design may include several transmit antennas to reduce combining network losses. For example, a six-channel trunked system may have two transmit antennas with three transmitters connected to each of the two transmit antennas. Because small variations affect every antenna, each antenna will have a slightly different directional pattern. Each antenna will interact with the tower and other nearby antennas differently. If one were to measure received signal levels, this would cause a variation among channels on a single trunked system. Variations in signal strength among channels on one trunked system can also be caused by: * failed parts in the combiner, * characteristics of the design, * loose connectors, * bad cables, * mistuned filters, or; * incorrectly installed components. =Modern= Cross-band repeaters are sometimes a part of government trunked radio systems. If one community is on a trunked system and the neighboring community is on a conventional system, a talk group or agency-fleet-subfleet may be designated to communicate with the other community. In an example where the community is on 153.755 MHz, transmitting on the trunked system talk group would repeat on 153.755 MHz. Signals received by a base station on 153.755 MHz would go over the trunked system on an assigned talk group. In conventional government systems, cross band repeaters are sometimes used to connect two agencies who use radio systems on different bands. For example, a fire department in Colorado was on a 46 MHz channel while a police department was on a 154 MHz channel, they built a cross-band repeater to allow communication between the two agencies. If one of the systems is simplex, the repeater must have logic preventing transmitter keying in both directions at the same time. Voting comparators with a transmitter keying matrix are sometimes used to connect incompatible base stations. =Historic= In looking at records of old systems, examples of cross-band commercial systems were found in every U.S. radio service where regulations allowed them. In California, specific systems using cross-band repeaters have existed at least since the 1960s. Historic examples of cross-band systems include:From historic records of Federal Communications Commission licenses. * Solano County Fire, (former Fire Radio Service): 46.240 input; 154.340 output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same-band repeater. * Mid-Valley Fire District, Fresno, (former Fire Radio Service): 46.140 input; 154.445 output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same-band repeater. * Santa Clara County Department of Parks and Recreation, (former Forestry Conservation Radio Service): 44.840 MHz input; 151.445 MHz output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same-band repeater. * State of California, Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Fire, (former Fire Radio Service): 33.980 MHz input; 154.160 MHz output. In commercial systems, manufacturers stopped making cross band mobile radio equipment with acceptable specifications for public safety systems in the early 1980s. At the time, some systems were dismantled because new radio equipment was not available. Sporadic E ionospheric ducting can make the 46 MHz and below frequencies unworkable in summer. =As links= For decades, cross-band repeaters have been used as fixed links. The links can be used for remote control of base stations at distant sites or to send audio from a diversity (voting) receiver site back to the diversity combining system (voting comparator). Some legacy links occur in the US 150‚Äì170 MHz band. US Federal Communications Commission rule changes did not allow 150 MHz links after the 1970s. Newer links are more often seen on 72‚Äì76 MHz (Mid-band), 450‚Äì470 MHz interstitial channels, or 900 MHz links. These links, known as fixed stations in US licensing, typically connect an equipment site with a dispatching office. =Vehicular repeaters= Modern amateur radios sometimes include cross-band repeat capability native to the radio transceiver. In commercial systems, cross-band repeaters are sometimes used in vehicular repeaters. For example, a 150 MHz hand held may communicate to a vehicle-mounted low-power transceiver. The low-power radio repeats transmissions from the portable over the vehicle's high power mobile radio, which has a much longer range. In these systems, the hand-held works so long as it is within range of the low power mobile repeater. The mobile radio is usually on a different band than the hand-held to reduce the chances of the mobile radio transmitter interfering with the transmission from the hand-held to the vehicle. * Motorola, for example, marketed a vehicular repeater system called PAC*RT. It was available for use with 150 MHz or 450 MHz hand-helds and interfaced with some Motorola mobile radios. * In the 1980s, General Electric Mobile Radio had a 463 MHz emergency medical services radio that featured a 453 MHz vehicular repeater link to a hand-held. There is a difficult engineering problem with these systems. If you get two vehicle radios at the same location, some protocol has to be established so that one portable transmitting doesn't activate two or more mobile radio transmitters. Motorola uses a hierarchy system with PAC*RT, each repeater transmits a tone when it is turned on, so the last one on site that turns on is the one that gets used. This is so several of them are not on at once. Vehicular repeaters are complex but can be less expensive than designing a system that covers a large area and works with the weak signal levels of hand-held radios. Some models of radio signals suggest that the transmitters of hand-held radios create received signals at the base station one to two orders of magnitude (10 to 20 decibels or 10 to 100 times) weaker than a mobile radio with a similar transmitter output power. Siting as part of system design Radio repeaters are typically placed in locations which maximize their effectiveness for their intended purpose: * \\"Low-level\\" repeaters are used for local communications, and are placed at low altitude to reduce interference with other users of the same radio frequencies. Low-level systems are used for areas as large as an entire city, or as small as a single building. * \\"High-level\\" repeaters are placed on tall towers or mountaintops to maximize their area of coverage. With these systems, users with low-powered radios (such as hand-held \\"walkie- talkies\\") can communicate with each other over many miles.

Their name, which designates their occupation, is derived from the same root as the Pushtu word for to graze. They were almost wholly engaged in the carrying trade between present-day India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. They assembled every autumn in the plains east of Ghazni, with their families, flocks, herds and long strings of camels and horses, laden with the goods of Bokhara and Kandahar; and forming caravans march through the Kakar and Waziri countries by the Zhob and Gumal passes of the Suliman Hills. Entering Dera Ismail Khan district about October they leave their families and flocks, their arms and some two-thirds of their fighting men, in the great grazing grounds which lie on either side of the Indus, and while some wander in search of employment, others pass on with their merchandise to the great cities of India, and even by rail as far as Calcutta, Karachi and Bombay. In the spring they again. assemble, and return by the same route to their homes in the hills about Ghazni and Kalat-i-Ghilzai. When the hot season begins, the men, leaving their belongings behind them, move off again to Kandahar, Herat and Bokhara, with the Indian and European merchandise which they have brought from Hindustan. For generations the Waziris have carried on war to the knife with these merchant traders. To meet the opposition that awaited them on the road the Povindahs used to move heavily armed, in bodies of from 5000 to 10,000, and regular marches and encampments were observed under an elected khan or leader.

He was born in Wilton, Connecticut in 1753. He traded with the native people along the Susquehanna River around 1776; in 1778, he moved to Fort Niagara where he provided supplies to the British. After the war, he resumed to trade with the native people and the Indian Department; his contact in the department was John Butler. Street was also involved in land speculation, but he did not gain much profit from that activity. In 1788, he became a justice of the peace in the Nassau District. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in the 2nd riding of Lincoln in 1796; in 1800, he was chosen as speaker. In 1807, he became a judge in the Niagara District. After earlier unsuccessful attempts at reelection, in 1808, he was elected in 3rd Lincoln. He was a captain in the 3rd Lincoln Militia and served as paymaster during the War of 1812. He later claimed compensation for property lost during the war. He died at Thorold in 1815.

One of the greatest existent examples of Norman architecture, it was begun in 1174 by William II of Sicily. In 1182 the church, dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, was, by a bull of Pope Lucius III, elevated to the rank of a metropolitan cathedral. Since 2015 it is part of the Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal√π and Monreale UNESCO Heritage site. The church is a national monument of Italy and one of the most important attractions of Sicily. Its size is 102 meters long and 40 meters wide. History According to a legend, William II of Sicily fell asleep under a carob tree while hunting in the woods near Monreale. The Holy Virgin appeared to him in dream, suggesting him to build a church here. After removing the tree, a treasure was found in its roots, whose golden coins were used to finance the construction. It is more likely that the church was part of a plan of large constructions in competition with the then bishop of Palermo, Walter Ophamil, who had ordered the large Cathedral of Palermo. The construction of Monreale, started in 1172, was approved by Pope Alexander III with a bull on 30 December 1174. Works, including an annexed abbey, were completed only in 1267 and the church consecrated at the presence of Pope Clement IV. In 1178 Pope Lucius III established the archdiocese of Monreale and the abbey church was elevated to the rank of cathedral. The archbishops obtained by the kings of Sicily a wide array of privileges and lands in the whole Italian peninsula. In 1270 Louis IX, King of France, brother of King Charles I of Naples, was buried here. In 1547-1569 a portico was added to the northern side, designed by Giovanni Domenico Gagini and Fazio Gagini, in Renaissance style, covered by a cross vault and featuring eleven round arches supported by Corinthian columns. In 1559 most of the internal pavement was added. Description The archiepiscopal palace and monastic buildings on the south side were of great size and magnificence, and were surrounded by a massive precinct wall, crowned at intervals by twelve towers. This has been mostly rebuilt, and but little now remains except ruins of some of the towers, a great part of the monks' dormitory and frater, and the splendid cloister, completed about 1200. The latter is well preserved, and is one of the finest Italian cloisters now extant both for size and beauty of detail. It is about 2,200 m2, with pointed arches decorated with diaper work, supported on pairs of columns in white marble, 216 in all, which were alternately plain and decorated by bands of patterns in gold and colors, made of glass tesserae, arranged either spirally or vertically from end to end of each shaft. The marble capitals are each carved with foliage, biblical scenes and allegories, no two being alike. At one angle, a square pillared projection contains the marble fountain or monks' lavatorium, evidently the work of Muslim sculptors. The church's plan is a mixture of Eastern Rite and Roman Catholic arrangement. The nave is like an Italian basilica, while the large triple-apsed choir is similar to one of the early three-apsed churches, of which so many examples still exist in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. It is like two quite different churches put together endwise. The basilican nave is wide, with narrow aisles. On each side, monolithic columns of grey oriental granite (except one, which is of cipolin marble) support eight pointed arches much stilted. The capitals of these (mainly Corinthian) are also of the classical period. There is no triforium, but a high clerestory with wide two-light windows, with simple tracery like those in the nave-aisles and throughout the church, which give sufficient light. The other half, eastern in two senses, is both wider and higher than the nave. It also is divided into a central space with two aisles, each of the divisions ending at the east with an apse. The roofs throughout are of open woodwork very low in pitch, constructionally plain, but richly decorated with colour, now mostly restored. At the west end of the nave are two projecting towers, with a narthex (entrance) between them. A large open atrium, which once existed at the west, is now completely destroyed, having been replaced by a Renaissance portico by Giovanni Domenico and Fazio Gagini (1547‚Äì1569). The main internal features are the vast (6,500 m2) glass mosaics, executed in Byzantine style between the late 12th and the mid-13th centuries by both local and Venetians masters. The tomb of William I of Sicily (the founder's father), a porphyry sarcophagus contemporary with the church, under a marble pillared canopy, and the founder William II's tomb, erected in 1575, were both shattered by a fire, which in 1811 broke out in the choir, injuring some of the mosaics and destroying all the fine walnut choir-fittings, the organs and most of the choir roof. The tombs were rebuilt, and the whole of the injured part of the church restored a few years after the fire. The present organ, revised in 1967 by Ruffatti, has six manuals and 102 stops. On the north of the choir are the tombs of Margaret of Navarre, wife of William I, and her two sons Roger and Henry, together with an urn containing the viscera of Saint Louis of France, who died in 1270. The pavement of the triple choir, though much restored, is a specimen of marble and porphyry mosaic in opus alexandrinum, with signs of Arab influence in its main lines. The mosaic pavement of the nave was completed in the 16th century, and has disks of porphyry and granite with marble bands intermingled with irregular lines. Two Baroque chapels were added in the 17th and 18th centuries, which are shut off from the rest of the church. The bronze doors of the mosaic-decorated portal on the left side was executed by Barisano da Trani in 1179.

He became well known during his tenure, spanning barely a year, as Chief of the special investigation unit into the assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme (1986-87). Holm√©r was commonly associated with the Swedish Social Democratic Party and was known to have good connections within its top ranks. After the assassination of Palme, Hans Holm√©r, then the Chief constable of Stockholm county police, personally took charge of the investigations (and without actually being designated as such, which would lead to later accusations of a breach in operative routines). Holm√©r assumed that the murder was of a political nature, but not related to the domestic political scene. No analysis was ever made of whether the deceased PM's political positions could have created motives to kill him, either from within the Swedish political scene or on the part of foreign governments or secret agencies. Instead Holm√©r opted to look for the assassins within certain immigrant groups living in Sweden, notably the Kurds. A Palme task force with a special Palme office were set up. Holm√©r particularly focused on the assumption that the Kurdish liberation movement PKK might have been behind the assassination. In the fall of 1986, a great number of search warrants were issued in order to follow the activities of a number of Kurds living in Sweden. Many people with presumed PKK connections were arrested - only to be released shortly afterwards due to lack of solid evidence. During press briefings up to this point, Holm√©r had insisted, with considerable panache, that the investigations were making steady progress and that, before too long, the crime would be solved. After the raid on the Kurds, things backfired. Although the hunt suddenly turned into failure, Holm√©r demanded further investigations along the same lines. This rapidly created a rupture between Holm√©r and the prosecutors who were critical of him for not respecting the demands of the law in making searches and arrests (they were also getting support from the media, now turning against the mesmerizing police chief). At this point, Holm√©r resigned from the investigations (February 1987). He would continue to follow the Kurd track, though, outside of the formal police inquiry, resulting, in 1988, in the sensational Ebbe Carlsson affair. Holm√©r spent the remainder of his life writing crime novels; he was also appointed to a UN-related police job in Vienna, overseeing the countering of drug trafficking. In one of his books, Olof Palme √§r skjuten! (\\"Olof Palme has been shot!\\"), Holm√©r describes his experiences leading the special investigation unit and goes on to blame the prosecution for the failure of the investigation. Holm√©r, on the other hand, has been strongly criticized by later commissions looking into the conduct of the investigations and also by journalists and independent investigators, owing to his singleminded pursuit of the Kurds track, the neglect of other leads, as well as for his use of phantom images of the suspected killer and his insistence that Palme was shot with a Smith & Wesson .357 gun (brandishing that model during an early press briefing) which is considered to have locked the investigations of possible weapons onto that model only for many years after. Fringe conspiracy theorists have occasionally claimed that Holm√©r had engaged in deception about his movements on the night of the assassination - the generally accepted view is that he got the news in the morning, hundreds of miles out of Stockholm, having driven up to Dalarna to take part in the cross-country skiing race, Vasaloppet, and then got into his car and turned back towards Stockholm at high speed. These theorists hint, without evidence, that he, with other policemen, were involved in the murder plot. The Chief of the Secret Police in Terroristerna (1975; \\"The Terrorists\\") by Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂, the final book in the Martin Beck mystery series, is modelled on Holm√©r; though the character remains nameless, references to his pronounced ears and the contempt in which he is held by many people on the political left (referring to the aftermath of the IB affair) give it away. Ironically, due to an oversight by one of the other police bureaucrats in the book, Olof Palme is killed by a completely inexperienced young girl, acting in desperate protest. Holm√©r, of course, would go on to lead the investigation after the actual Palme assassination a decade later.

The prison was established in 1649 when the Malmg√•rden in Alstavik at L√•ngholmen was erected and was closed in 1825. The building became state property in 1724 and was used as a spinning house (spinnhus). In 1825 the spinnhus was relocated to Norrmalm. After the move, L√•ngholmen Prison started to operate on the grounds. L√•ngholmen Prison was built 1874‚Äî1880 as the central prison of Sweden, and was temporary closed down between 1972‚Äî1975. Since 1989, L√•ngholmen Prison has been a 112-room hotel and hostel, renovated between 2007-2008. L√•ngholmen was originally rocky and barren.

Retrieved 3 February 2010 was an Australian geologist, author and social commentator. Life Smyth was born in Wallsend, Northumberland, England, the son of Edward Smyth, a mining engineer, and his wife Ann, n√©e Brough. Smyth was educated at a school at Whickham, afterwards studied geology, chemistry and natural science. In 1846 Smyth worked at the Derwent Iron Works and then in 1851 was employed as a clerk at Consett Iron Works. Smyth arrived in the colony of Victoria on 14 November 1852 and was for a short period on the goldfields before entering the Victorian survey department as a draftsman under the surveyor-general, Andrew Clarke. In 1854 Smyth was placed in charge of the meteorological observations, and in 1860 became secretary for the Department of Mines at the height of the Australian gold rushes. Smyth published The Prospector's Handbook (1863), and in 1869 a large volume, The Gold Fields and Mineral Districts of Victoria. He was also responsible for various pamphlets on the mining resources of the colony including Hints for the Guidance of Surveyors and Others Collecting Specimens of Rocks, which appeared in 1871. On 1 February 1876 several members of Smyth's staff sent a petition to the minister for mines asking that an inquiry should be held into the despotic conduct of Smyth towards his subordinates. Three members of parliament were appointed to inquire into the matter, and after a series of sittings held in February, March and April 1876, Smyth resigned from the service. Smyth had been working for many years collecting materials for a book on the life of the aborigines, which was published in 1878 at the expense of the Victorian government in two large volumes, The Aborigines of Victoria: with notes relating to the habits of the Natives of Other Parts of Australia and Tasmania. Smyth visited India in 1879 and made a Report on the Gold Mines of the South-eastern Portion of the Wynaad and the Carcoor Ghat (1880). Smyth died of cancer at his home Medenia in High Street, Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne. Smyth was survived by his wife Emma Charlotte, n√©e Hay, whom he had married on 15 August 1856 at St Paul's Church, Melbourne, and by a son and daughter. He was buried in the St Kilda Cemetery. Smyth was an able and hardworking man, not suited to be the head of a department. He is remembered for his book on Aboriginal people and their cultures in connexion with which he had the assistance of many helpers. A large amount of material was collected and is valuable as a resource for studying Aboriginal cultures today. The beauty of this material is the honesty in which he wrote and the lack of political influence as is the case of many current works.

Salland is a historical dominion in the west and north of the present Dutch province of Overijssel. Nowadays Salland is usually used to indicate a region corresponding to the part of the former dominion more or less to the west of Twente. History Salland in 1757 (the area with yellow borders; right Salland (or Salalant, as it was known) is first mentioned during the early Middle Ages. The region is most likely named after the river IJssel, anciently known as Isala, and the lakeland Sallzee at the confluence of the rivers Vecht and IJssel. The region may be the original residence of the Salian Franks.Perry, p. * Salalant at this time was a shire (gouw) made up of the area between Wijhe, Mastenbroek, and Dalfsen, in other words, the region circling Zwolle. In 795, Salalant belonged to a count Wracharius and remained in his family until the 11th century. In 814, mention is made of a Salahom, located where the IJssel empties into the Sallzee, and of its acquisition by the Lorsch Abbey (near Worms). In 1086, the four parts of Oversticht (i.e., Salland, Twente, Vollenhove, and Drenthe) belonged first to Egbert III, descendant of Wracharius, and count of Salland, Westergo, and Estergo, but were confiscated by Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, given to the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht, and incorporated into the margravate of Islegowe. Salalant gradually grew to the south as far as the rivers Meppelerdiep and Reest and to the west as far as the Regge. In 1046 Deventer and its vicinity belonged to the county of Hamaland but was incorporated along with the area between Dalfsen and Gramsbergen into Salland in 1246. In 1225, the office of episcopal sheriff (bisschoppelijke schout) for Salland was established, and in 1308 the bishop granted a dike-right (dijkrecht) over the land between the Hunnepe to the coast; this area later became known as the Salland sheriffdom (Sallandse Schouw). In 1336, the bishop pledged over almost all of Overijssel - including Salland - to the count of Guelders. Ten years later, the new bishop, Jan van Arkel, was able to retrieve the pledged territories. He also reformed administration by breaking Oversticht into the three sheriffdoms of Twente, Vollenhove, and Salland. In time they were demoted to bailiwicks (drostambten), and even though they were superseded by the sheriffdoms of IJsselmuiden, Diepenheim, Haaksbergen, and the sheriff of Hasselt was made high sheriff, the original three bailiwicks have nonetheless served as the basis for Oversticht's three-way division to this day. When the Archbishop of Utrecht sold his domains to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1527, Salland became one of the three constituent parts of the new dominion of Overijssel, which in turn became one of the seven provinces of the Dutch Republic in 1581 (Drenthe became a dominion in its own right). Geography The borders of Salland are not well defined, but the largest area which may be indicated by Salland, corresponding to the historical dominion, is bound to the west by the provincial border with Gelderland, which is partly formed by river IJssel; to the north by the Meppelerdiep stream and the provincial border with Drente, which partly consists of the Reest stream; to the east by the borders with the German state of Lower Saxony and the eastern Overijssel region of Twente; and to the south by the border with the Gelderland region of Achterhoek, part of which is formed by the Schipbeek stream, with other words Salland is all of Overijssel with the exception of Twente and the region known in Dutch as \\"Kop van Overijssel\\". Geologically, most of Salland's landscape consists of a lowland covered with river sediment. To the east, large moors have been drained to provide pastures. These moors, together with the hilly Holterberg region, were the natural border with Twente. On the Holterberg, stretches of the originally vast heathland have been preserved. In the northwest, reclaimed boglands used for peat digging have resulted in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding, pre-1932 (in that year, the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea to become the IJsselmeer lake). Salland is a low-lying area dominated by a number of rivers and streams, which have deposited rich layers of river clay. The most important of these waterways is of course river IJssel; others include the Zwarte Water and (Overijsselse) Vecht rivers; the Regge stream, which flows through Twente to spend its last few kilometers in Salland before ending in the Vecht near Ommen; the Schipbeek stream; and the Soestwetering stream, which merges with a number of lesser streams near Zwolle to form river Zwarte Water. Three of Overijssel's major cities, Deventer, Kampen and the province's capital, Zwolle, lie within Salland, if the definition ascribing the largest area to Salland, is used. Other places of import include Ommen and Hardenberg, which are both quite often described as being in the \\"Vechtstreek\\" (Vecht Region) or \\"Vechtdal\\" (Vecht Valley), named after the river, rather than in Salland. Nowadays however, Salland is usually used to indicate the rural area in between Deventer, Zwolle, Ommen and Rijssen-Holten, with Raalte being in the centre of that era and thus having been able to become the \\"unofficial capital\\" of Salland. The Salland tourism board describes Salland as the land in between the river IJssel and the hills, and agrees thus on a much smaller Salland than the historical dominion of that name. Municipal reforms and the boundary with Twente Intra-Overijssel municipal reforms of the early twenty-first century have somewhat blurred the boundary between Salland and Twente, as municipalities historically associated with Salland have merged with Twente municipalities (and now form part of the Twente Region as defined by the Dutch government). Specifically, this regards Holten (now part of the Rijssen-Holten municipality) and Den Ham (now part of the Twenterand municipality). Industrial and commercial ties with Twente and its location east of the Sallandse Heuvelrug hill ridge caused the municipality of Hellendoorn to switch association earlier in the twentieth century.

It is based on iteratively improving an assignment of the variables until all constraints are satisfied. In particular, local search algorithms typically modify the value of a variable in an assignment at each step. The new assignment is close to the previous one in the space of assignment, hence the name local search. All local search algorithms use a function that evaluates the quality of assignment, for example the number of constraints violated by the assignment. This amount is called the cost of the assignment. The aim of local search is that of finding an assignment of minimal cost, which is a solution if any exists. Point A is not a solution, but no local move from there decreases cost. However, a solution exists at point B. Two classes of local search algorithms exist. The first one is that of greedy or non-randomized algorithms. These algorithms proceed by changing the current assignment by always trying to decrease (or at least, non- increase) its cost. The main problem of these algorithms is the possible presence of plateaus, which are regions of the space of assignments where no local move decreases cost. The second class of local search algorithm have been invented to solve this problem. They escape these plateaus by doing random moves, and are called randomized local search algorithms. Greedy algorithms=Hill climbing The most basic form of local search is based on choosing the change that maximally decreases the cost of the solution. This method, called hill climbing, proceeds as follows: first, a random assignment is chosen; then, a value is changed so as to maximally improve the quality of the resulting assignment. If no solution has been found after a given number of changes, a new random assignment is selected. Hill climbing algorithms can only escape a plateau by doing changes that do not change the quality of the assignment. As a result, they can be stuck in a plateau where the quality of assignment has a local maxima. GSAT (greedy sat) was the first local search algorithm for satisfiability, and is a form of hill climbing. Constraint weighting or breakout method A method for escaping from a local minimum is that of using a weighted sum of violated constraints as a measure of cost, and changing some weights when no improving move is available. More precisely, if no change reduces the cost of the assignment, the algorithm increases the weight of constraints violated by the current assignment. This way, every move that would not otherwise change the cost of the solution decreases it. Moreover, the weight of constraints that remain violated for a large number of moves keeps increasing. Therefore, during a number of moves not satisfying a constraint, the cost of moves to assignments satisfying that constraint keeps increasing. Tabu search A drawback of hill climbing with moves that do not decrease cost is that it may cycle over assignments of the same cost. Tabu search overcomes this problem by maintaining a list of \\"forbidden\\" assignments, called the tabu list. In particular, the tabu list typically contains only the most recent changes. More precisely, it contains the last variable-value pair such that the variable has been recently assigned to the value. This list is updated every time the assignment is changed. If a variable is assigned to a value, the variable-value pair is added to the list, and the oldest pair is removed from it. This way, the list only contains the most recent assignments to a variable. If a variable-value pair is in the tabu list, then changing the current assignment by setting the variable to the value is forbidden. The algorithm can only choose the best move among the ones that are not forbidden. This way, it cannot cycle over the same solution unless the number of moves in this cycle is larger than the length of the tabu list. Random walk A random walk algorithm sometimes moves like a greedy algorithm but sometimes moves randomly. It depends on a parameter p, which is a real number between 0 and 1. At every move, with probability p the algorithm proceeds like a greedy algorithm, trying to maximally decrease the cost of the assignment. With probability 1-p, however, the solution is changed in some other way, which involves some degree of randomness. WalkSAT The random move of WalkSAT is changing the value of a random variable of a random violated constraint. For propositional satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulae, which is the original settings of this algorithm, every such a move changes the value of the variable from true to false or vice versa, and produce the satisfiability of the violated constraint. As for all random walk strategies, a random move is only done with a given probability, and a move maximally decreasing the cost is done otherwise. Simulated annealing The technique of simulated annealing is based on changing the probability of doing a random move over one that maximally decreasing the cost. In particular, the name originates from the strategy of decreasing the probability of doing random moves during the execution of the algorithm, thus virtually \\"freezing\\" the space of search. In particular, if the improvement of cost d of a move is negative (the move increases cost), this move is done with probability e^{-d \\\\cdot T}, where T is a real number. Since the probability of doing this move increases with T, this parameter is called the temperature. Simulated annealing decreases this temperature over time, thus allowing more random moves at the beginning and less after time. Local search on a cycle cutset Local search usually works on all variables, improving a complete assignment to them. However, local search can also be run on a subset of variables, using some other mechanism for the other variables. A proposed algorithm works on a cycle cutset, which is a set of variables that, if removed from the problem, makes it acyclic. For any assignment of the variables of the cutset, the remaining problem has a forest as primal graph. As a result, it can be solved efficiently. In order to guide local search, an algorithm detecting the minimal number of constraints that can be violated is used in place of a satisfiability algorithm on the for forest part of the problem. This minimal number is found by determining the cost of each variable assignment. This cost is the minimal number of constraints violated by an assignment of the variables in the subtree rooted at the variable, when the variable takes the given value. This cost can be calculated as follows. If Cost(x=a) denotes the cost of the assignment x=a and y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n are the children of x, the following formula holds. In this formula, Violates(x=a, y_i=b) is the 0 or 1 depending on whether the assignment x=a, y_i=b violates the constraint between x and y. :Cost(x=a) = \\\\sum_{i=1,\\\\ldots,n} \\\\min_{y_i=b} ( Cost(y_i=b) + Violates(x=a, y_i=b) ) The cost for variables in the cutset is zero, and these variables are assumed to be allowed to take only their given value. With these assumptions, the above formula allows computing the cost of all variable evaluations by iteratively proceeding bottom-up from the leaves to the root(s) of the forest. The cost of variable evaluations can be used by local search for computing the cost of a solution. The cost of values of the roots of the forest is indeed the minimal number of violated constraints in the forest for these given values. These costs can therefore used to evaluate the cost of the assignment to the cutset variables and to estimate the cost of similar assignments on the cutset variables.

She has focused her career on empowering women, using graffiti and murals as acts of rebellion and self-expression. As Lady Pink says, \\"It's not just a boys club. We have a sisterhood thing going.\\" She was nicknamed the \\"first lady of graffiti\\" because she was one of the first women active in the early 1980s New York City subway graffiti subculture. In 1980, she created the all-female graffiti crew Ladies of the Arts (LOTA). Within a few years, Lady Pink began running with the graffiti crews TC5 (The Cool 5) and TPA (The Public Animals). From 1979 to 1985, Lady Pink painted New York City Subway trains. She took a short hiatus in 1987 from painting outdoors. Then in 1993 to 1997 she worked on freight trains with her husband, Smith. In 1980, she was included in the landmark New York show \\"GAS: Graffiti Art Success\\" at Fashion Moda, which traveled in a modified form downtown to The New Museum of Contemporary Art. Early life Fabara was born in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1964 and moved to the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York when she was seven years old. She grew up wanting to be an architect like her father. She started her graffiti writing career in 1979 following the loss of a boyfriend. She exorcised her grief by tagging her boyfriend's name across New York City. Lady Pink studied at the High School of Art & Design in Manhattan. As a student there, she was introduced to graffiti and began writing at age fifteen. She is married to another graffiti artist, SMITH (Roger Smith formally of the graffiti duo Sane Smith), with whom she often collaborates on murals and commercial work.  Name origin  Lady Pink was first given her name ‚ÄúPink‚Äù by Seen TC5. The name was chosen for aesthetics because the name Pink is feminine and because she wanted other writers to know that she was a girl. Lady Pink also said that the letters appealed to her; the way the \\"K\\" kicked out and how the \\"I\\" was cute and could be dotted with a heart. She started calling herself Lady Pink because of her love of historical romances, England, the Victorian period, and the aristocracy. She titled herself like royalty. She never wanted to tag her full name because she did not want to be associated with the Pink Lady, a woman in the club scene who sold pink cocaine.  Career = Early career  Lady Pink‚Äôs Career as an artist started to take off after the 1980s, following the Graffiti Art Success for America show which invited graffiti artists to paint on the walls of the gallery. In 1983, she played the leading role in the film Wild Style,and was involved with a book entitled Subway Art by Martha Cooper and Henry Chalfant. During this time, she collaborated with Jenny Holzer several times for an exhibition at Fashion MODA. Her first solo show, \\"Femmes-Fatales,\\" was in 1984, when she was 21, at the Moore College of Art & Design in Philadelphia.  Later career  Lady Pink's studio paintings often use themes of New York City Subway trains and POP-surrealist cityscapes. Some of her pieces are in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, as well as the Groningen Museum in the Netherlands. Lady Pink is now visits schools to teach students about the power of art and how it can serve as a medium for self-expression and community engagement. Each year she does a mural project with the students of Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens. Her mural, Pink (2007) work was one of the many murals destroyed at 5Pointz in Queens, however in February 2018 the Brooklyn Supreme Court awarded each of the 45 artists for their destroyed work.

A claim of inequitable conduct is a defense to allegations of patent infringement. Even in an instance when a valid patent suffers infringement, a court ruling on an allegation of infringement may exercise its power of equitable discretion not to enforce the patent if the patentee (the patent owner) has engaged in inequitable conduct. Duty of candor The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Rule 56 explains that patents are \\"affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability.\\" Accordingly, each individual person \\"associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability.\\"37 CFR ¬ß 1.56 (1977, revised 2012), commonly referred to as Rule 56. Specifics Inequitable conduct occurs when a patent applicant misrepresents or omits material information with the specific intent to deceive the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In other words, the elements of inequitable conduct are materiality and deceptive intent. Deceptive intent may be inferred from indirect or circumstantial evidence but not from materiality. Information is material if \\"the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art\\" or if \\"affirmative egregious misconduct\\" has happened. See Therasense, Inc. v. Becton.Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Co., 649 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (en banc). In response to Therasense, the USPTO rewrote its definition of materiality to say that information is material if :(1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim; or :(2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in: ::(i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or ::(ii) Asserting an argument of patentability. The misrepresentation or omission can include: :(a) failure to submit material prior art known by the applicant; :(b) failure to explain references in a foreign language or submit pre-existing full or partial translations of the references; :(c) misstatements of fact, including misstatements in affidavits concerning patentability; and :(d) mis-description of inventorship (authorship). The party asking the court to decline to enforce the patent, usually the alleged infringer, bears the burden of proving inequitable conduct to the court. The moving party must show by clear and convincing evidence that the patentee intentionally withheld or misrepresented information, and that the information was material. Proven inequitable conduct in any claim can expose the entire patent to unenforceability. History The unclean hands cases of Keystone Driller v. General Excavator, Hazel-Atlas v. Hartford, and Precision v. Automotive formed the basis for the doctrine of inequitable conduct that developed and evolved over time. Keystone case In the 1933 Keystone case, the patentee manufactured and suppressed evidence in a patent application and its subsequent defense in two different infringement actions: the patentee paid the prior art user to perjure himself by signing a false affidavit that his use was an abandoned experiment, and bought the prior art user's agreement to keep secret the prior use details and to suppress that evidence. Unsurprisingly, the patentee also did not disclose those facts to the PTO or to co-litigants in the infringement actions. The defendants in the second action discovered and presented evidence of the malfeasance, and while the trial court refused dismissal on that ground, on appeal the Sixth Circuit reversed the trial court and remanded for dismissal, and the Supreme Court affirmed.Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 US 240 at 243-47, 54 S.Ct. 146, 1933. Hazel-Atlas case In the 1944 Hazel-Atlas case, a patentee's attorneys also manufactured and suppressed evidence in support of a patent application by hiring an expert to publish an article in a trade journal under his own name praising the invention as a remarkable advance in the art. After the patent was approved and issued on that basis, the patentee brought an infringement action against Hazel-Atlas but was unsuccessful in the trial court, so the patentee then appealed the matter to the Third Circuit where the patentee introduced the procured trade journal article. That appellate court reversed the trial court and ruled for the patentee, after which Hazel-Atlas settled on the infringement claim, and the patentee then paid the expert more money. The patentee's lies were discovered, however, in US v. Hartford-Empire,United States v. Hartford-Empire Co., 46 F.Supp. 541 (N.D.Ohio 1942). whereupon Hazel-Atlas petitioned the Third Circuit to reconsider its prior decision, and although it refused, the Supreme Court didn't and reversed, vacating the appellate court's decision and the judgment against Hazel-Atlas, and reinstating the trial court's original judgment dismissing the patentee's case.Hazel-Atlas Co. v. Hartford Co., 322 U.S. 238 at 240 at 243-251, 64 S.Ct. 997, 1944. Precision case In the 1945 Precision case, the patentee suppressed evidence of perjury before the PTO and attempted to enforce the perjury-tainted patent. In the application to the PTO the patentee claimed false dates of conception, disclosure, drawing, description, and reduction to practice, and then testified to the veracity of the same lies in an interference proceeding. The competing patentee discovered the truth, but procured rights to the patent by private settlement, complicit in the scheme, and then sought to enforce the patent against others. In a later enforcement action, a trial court learned of the facts and ruled against the patentee based on the patentee having unclean hands, but the Seventh Circuit appellate court reversed, and on further appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, reinstating the trial court's decision.Precision Co. v. Automotive Co., 324 U.S. 806 at 807-20, 65 S.Ct. 993, 1945. Landmark court cases=McKesson case In the 2007 case McKesson v. Bridge Medical,\\"McKesson Info. Sols., Inc. v. Bridge Med., Inc., 487 F.3d 897, 902 (Fed. Cir. 2007). the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals found inequitable conduct because a patent attorney failed to provide to patent examiners information from an office action in a related case. McKesson is a cautionary tale for patent applicants: be overly inclusive with patent submissions to ensure no omission will jeopardize a patent.Stickevers, John, Vague Allegations No Longer Acceptable When Asserting Inequitable Conduct Defense, Sunstein IP Update, 2009-08. Exergen case However, a subsequent CAFC decision seems to directly contradict the standard used in McKesson. In the 2009 case Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and S.A.A.T. Systems,Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores, 575 F. 3d 1312, Ct. App. (Fed. Cir.) Aug. 2009. Nos. 2006-1491, 2007-1180. SAAT attempted to defend with a claim of inequitable conduct, alleging Exergen was aware of two earlier patents that it did not cite to the examiner during prosecution. The district court denied SAAT's motion for inequitable conduct as a defense, however, holding that SAAT's allegations were not specific enough to meet the particularity requirement of FRCP 9(b). The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this ruling, and ruled that such allegations must specify who engaged in inequitable conduct, what precisely that person knowingly withheld or misstated to the PTO, and how the omission or misstatement affected the patentability of individual claims. The court opined that inequitable conduct is not a \\"magic incantation to be asserted against every patentee\\" by a \\"mere showing that art or information having some degree of materiality was not disclosed\\". Therasense case In a further development, in the 2011 case of Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Co, the same Federal Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc limited this defense to (a) occasions when patent-holders' acts are related directly to the patent, and (b) when it can be proved that patent holders engaged in deceitful intent.Zebley, Julia, Federal appeals court restricts inequitable conduct defense for patent law, Jurist, 2011-05-26.

It was named after the 1903 best-selling novel The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come by native Kentuckian John Fox, Jr. Features of the park include Raven Rock, Log Rock, and a mountain lake. The section of the park is also a legally dedicated state nature preserve by the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves. Park features=Natural formations Raven Rock is a naturally bare, large rock face composed mostly of limestone, leaning at a 45¬∞ angle over in the air. Nearby is the Cave Amphitheater. In the back of the Cave Amphitheater are deep crevices that house thousands of bats. Also within the park is a natural sandstone bridge called \\"Log Rock\\", which resembles a petrified tree that has fallen over. Unfortunately, the Log Rock has been severely vandalized over the years, and the underside is now covered with people's names that they have spray-painted or scratched onto the stone. There are also numerous overlooks to the valleys below. The most popular of these is the Creech Overlook, which provides a stunning view. Wildlife Black bears inhabit Kingdom Come State Park and adjoining lands in the Cumberland, Kentucky area. Black bears naturally recolonized extreme eastern Kentucky counties (Harlan, Letcher, Bell, and Pike) over the last three decades from the neighboring states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee. The species was not reintroduced to Kingdom Come State Park or any portion of Kentucky east of Interstate 75. It is illegal to feed black bears. Numerous other wildlife species call Kingdom Come State Park home as well, including the state-threatened common raven, fox, multiple species of hawks, cottontail rabbit, multiple bat species, coyote, multiple species of amphibians, and an array of insect life. Activities and amenities Fourteen hiking trails, a 9-hole miniature golf course, lake with paddle boats, picnic shelters, fishing, and primitive campsites are available at the park. The park offers access to Little Shepherd Trail, a primitive road for mountain biking and adventure driving that winds across the Pine Mountain ridgetop to the city of Harlan.

Aprahamian, however, usually described himself as a music critic. He was considered an urbane, flamboyant and warm-hearted man, described by his old friend and colleague John Amis (in The Guardian, 21 January 2005) as \\"a mixture of characters from Proust and P.G. Wodehouse\\". Background Felix Aprahamian was born in London in 1914. Christened Apraham Felix Bartev Aprahamian, he changed his name by deed poll to just Felix Aprahamian. His father changed his surname from Hovanessian, deciding to take his own father's Christian name, Apraham, and attach the patronymic ‚Äìian, to form Aprahamian, or son of Apraham. At the age of 17, Aprahamian became Assistant Secretary to the Organ Music Society, and he developed into a highly proficient keyboard player. He later recalled that it was his passion for music which led him to fail his school matriculation: he was self-taught in almost every area of music, as well as literature and the other arts. In 1933, he went to France with two friends (Douglas Peart and Ernest Chapman) to visit the ageing Frederick Delius in Grez-sur-Loing, and in Paris he met Charles-Marie Widor. Early career In 1935 Aprahamian was made Secretary of the Organ Music Society, and the same year one of his first articles, \\"Eugene Goossens in London\\", was published in the Musical Times. During World War II, he worked as Concert Director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra and from 1942 onwards he helped Tony Mayer organise the extraordinary series Concerts de Musique Fran√ßaise at the Wigmore Hall in London. In 1946 he joined United Music Publishers as a consultant and, with Mayer at the French Embassy, played a central role in bringing French music to post-war British audiences. In 1948 he became Deputy Music Critic of the Sunday Times and stayed for 41 years; his reviews were notable for their prose and enthusiasm. He first corresponded with Olivier Messiaen in 1936 and was responsible for organising the first complete performance in England of Messiaen's La Nativit√© du Seigneur, played by the composer himself at St Alban's Church, Holborn, in 1938. They developed a warm friendship which lasted until the composer's death in 1992. His first encounter with Francis Poulenc was well before the start of World War II; their first meeting was at J. & W. Chester's music shop, when he asked the composer to sign a photograph, duly inscribed \\"Qui est ce monstre?\\" (\\"Who is this monster?\\"). The two became firm friends and Aprahamian often visited Poulenc in Paris. His talent for making friends such as these led to many memorable events at his house in Muswell Hill. Poulenc first played through his El√©gie in memory of Dennis Brain there, and in 1945 Messiaen and Yvonne Loriod gave a private rendition of Messiaen's Visions de l'Amen before the British premi√®re. Among British composers, his greatest passion was for Delius (he was an adviser to the Delius Trust from 1961, and later the President of the Society), and he was on amicable terms with Benjamin Britten, William Walton and Michael Tippett: while at the LPO, he was instrumental in arranging the premiere of Tippett's A Child of Our Time in 1944. Other friends included the conductors Thomas Beecham, Victor de Sabata, Roger D√©sormi√®re, Ernest Ansermet and Charles M√ºnch, as well as the singer Maggie Teyte, the cellist Pierre Fournier, the pianist Monique Haas, and the composer Florent Schmitt. The organ and organ music For much of the 20th century Aprahamian occupied a pivotal position in the organ world and, most notably, the 'Organ Reform Movement' from its earliest years in the UK. Arguably its most noteworthy achievement, the organ of the Royal Festival Hall, is due to him. He was consulted by the London County Council (seemingly by telephone) to recommend a consultant for the proposed organ for the new Royal Festival Hall. His immediate (and sole) nomination was Ralph Downes who was duly appointed and both designed the organ and saw its construction through to completion, thereafter remaining curator of the organ until his death. Downes initiated a series of weekday concerts which brought the organ to a new, wider audience, also appearing sometimes as performer. For these concerts Aprahamian provided brilliantly-written programme notes which were at the same time elegant, concise and authoritative. He also reviewed the performances in his weekly column as deputy music critic (to Desmond Shawe-Taylor) of The Sunday Times. Organ music was a lifelong enthusiasm of Aprahamian, and his vast library of organ music is now at the Royal College of Organists. The installation in his Muswell Hill house of an organ inherited from his friend Andr√© Marchal in 1982 has been a constant musical inspiration to his prot√©g√©, the organist and composer David Liddle, who became David Aprahamian Liddle shortly after Felix's death, as a tribute to his mentor and friend. Honours In 1994, Aprahamian was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the only music critic to receive this accolade, and he was touched to be in the same company as Berlioz, Ravel and Sibelius. He was \\"Membre d'Honneur\\" of the Centre International Albert Roussel. Aside from music his passions included tropical fish, Proust and his Japanese garden (a miniature Giverny in London N10). Nigel Simeone has written a series of books based on materials in Felix Aprahamian's archives which are listed in the Bibliography.

A re- recorded version, recorded in November 1971 at Trident Studios in London, was released on the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The main riff is representative of glam rock's influence as a bridge between 1950s rock and roll, specifically rockabilly, and the punk to come; it draws on rockabilly influences such as Eddie Cochran, in a way that would influence punk records such as \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" by Ramones.

A Grand Marshal of the Crown, Marshal of Prussia and a voivode of Che≈Çmno, he is best remembered as a strong proponent of the expansion and the modernisation of the city of Warsaw. He is also the eponym of Marsza≈Çkowska Street (Marshal Street) in Warsaw, one of the major and most iconic streets of Poland's capital. Biography=Early life He was born in 1683 to Grand Marshal of the Crown Kazimierz Ludwik Bieli≈Ñski and Ludwika Maria Bieli≈Ñska, daughter of Grand Treasurer of the Crown. While officially a high-ranking military officer, for most of his life Bieli≈Ñski had been in fact a skilled civilian administrator. Initially a starost of Malbork, Czersk, Gr√≥jec and Garwolin (since 1713), with time he allied himself to the mighty Czartoryski family. This allowed him to move to the royal court and start his career there. Political career In his role as a Marshal of the Court (since 1732) and then Grand Marshal of Poland during the reign of Augustus II the Strong, Bieli≈Ñski had in fact administrative and judiciary control over a large part of Prussia (as Grand Treasurer of Prussia), Masovia (as cze≈õnik of the Crown) and the city of Warsaw. In 1740 he created the Warsaw-based Cobblestone Commission, tasked with paving the streets and creating a modern sewer system. Under his leadership in 20 years the commission managed to pave 222 streets, a large majority of streets of the contemporary Polish capital. In 1752, he permitted the creation of the first professional fire brigade in Poland (based in Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski). In 1757 with his personal funds he created a jurydyka of Bielino, a small village that over time became the core of what is now the city centre of Warsaw. During his civil service he also served as a starost of Kowalewo, Brodnica and Garwolin. Marriage and death He married Dorota Henrietta n√©e Przebendowska, daughter of his father's successor as Grand Treasurer and widow of Jan Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, the Voivode of Nowogr√≥dek. He died heir-less on 8 October 1766 in Warsaw. In 1770 the Marsza≈Çkowska Street was named in his honour and bears that name to this day. Bibliography * Helena Waniczk√≥wna: Bieli≈Ñski Franciszek h.

It was one of many similar massacres carried out by Soviet forces in Lithuania, and other parts of the Soviet Union, during June 1941. Several thousand people were killed in these massacres. The Rainiai massacre was far from the largest of these massacres, but it is one of the best-known, due to the brutality and tortures inflicted on the victims by the perpetrators. Similar atrocities were committed in other places, like the Tartu massacre, in which almost two hundred and fifty people were murdered.Estonia: Tartu's Dark Side - The Dark Side of Tartu - ExpatExchange.com Massacre right A decision had been made to carry out the massacre after the June Revolt had taken place, during which the Lithuanian Activist Front had deposed the Soviet government in Lithuania, and Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities were unable to evacuate the inmates (political prisoners) of the Tel≈°iai prison, but they did not want to abandon them, as the inmates would then have been freed by the local population or by the Germans. Therefore, a punishment squad of the Red Army led by Dontsov was called in to \\"liquidate\\" them. Most of the prisoners were put into trucks during the night of June 24 and taken to the Rainiai forest where they were tortured and killed. Many of the victims were so mutilated that only twenty-seven bodies could be identified after they were exhumed, only three days later.Lituanus Data Bank According to the coroner's examination after the exhumation, both the report and the testimonies of witnesses, concurred that the Soviets cut off tongues, ears, genitals, scalps, put genitals into mouths, picked out eyes, pulled off fingernails, made belts of victims' skins to tie their hands, burned them with torches and acid, crushed bones and skulls, all done while the prisoners were still alive. The organizers of the massacre included Pyotr Raslan, Boris Mironov, Nachman Dushanski, political leader of 8th border army Mikhail Kompanyanec, NKVD Kretinga county deputy director Yermolayev, NKVD lieutenant Zhdanov and others. Victims right Most of those who were killed in the Rainiai massacre had been arrested for political reasons from the time when Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Some of them, like Vladas Petronaitis, were arrested for their roles in the independence struggle or their societal roles in independent Lithuania (\\"intellectuals\\", politicians, lawyers, policemen and public servants). Some had been arrested as \\"enemies of the revolution\\" for their business interests, land ownership or savings, as Soviet propaganda taught that businessmen and landlords were thieves and oppressors. Other people were arrested for possession of non-communist literature (such as books which supported the idea of independent Lithuania or were written by authors considered to be in the wrong by the Soviets), owning a Lithuanian flag, not giving their crops to the Soviet authorities, and similar \\"crimes\\". Others had been arrested without any evidence, because their friends had been arrested or because someone had \\"denounced\\" them. This group included mainly younger people, such as students from the Tel≈°iai Crafts School (aged 18 ‚Äì 19), and young people from the villages around Tel≈°iai. Many were arrested for having been members of certain parties and organizations such as Boy Scouts.Lithuanian Resistance to Foreign Occupation Some of the youth had been preparing for an anti-Soviet rebellion. These people were not tried, but were held in the Tel≈°iai prison until the time it was decided to carry out the massacre. While most of the prisoners of the Tel≈°iai prison were killed in the massacre, a few were released prior to the massacre. After the massacre When the bodies of those killed in Rainiai were exhumed and reburied after the Soviets retreated from the country, the funeral turned into a mass demonstration against the former Soviet occupation. Both the German and Soviet occupying forces tried to use the events for propaganda purposes. Since several of the organizers and perpetrators were Jewish, the Nazi German occupying force produced propaganda blaming Jewish Bolshevik activists for the massacre. Perversely, in 1942, Soviet planes dropped propaganda pamphlets in Samogitia asking Who are those \\"Bolshevik martyrs\\"? and blaming German forces for the massacre.XXI am≈æius The local citizenry were well aware of the Soviet responsibility and in 1942, planned to build a chapel, designed by Jonas Virakas, to honor and remember the victims of the massacre. However, as the Soviet Union reoccupied the area again in 1944, it was not built. Throughout the Soviet occupation, discussion of the massacre was suppressed, and it was not permitted to hold memorial services commemorating it. Despite this, local people, under threat of arrest used to build crosses at the site of the Rainiai massacre; the crosses were periodically demolished by the Soviet authorities, only to spring up again. The political organization SƒÖj≈´dis began to discuss the massacre more openly in 1988, during the glasnost policy of Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev. After Lithuania regained its independence, a chapel designed by Algirdas ≈Ωebrauskas was built in the Tel≈°iai cemetery. Funded by donations, it was built in 1991, and became one of the first memorials to be erected for the people who were killed by the Soviet authorities during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania (1940‚Äì1941 and 1944‚Äì1991). Prosecutions Ceremony at the Rainiai memorial in 1995 The perpetrators of the massacre continued to hold high positions in the Soviet Union; some were awarded various medals. Pyotr Raslan, for example, was employed as an official in the Soviet Ministry of Religious Affairs. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, those perpetrators who had remained in Lithuania, fled to Russia and Israel.F&P; RFE/RL Archive Lithuania requested their extradition to put them on trial, which Russia has refused, saying he is 'too ill to be tried'.Free Baltic News Archives Some of the perpetrators have since died. In 2001, the ≈†iauliai Area Court in northwest Lithuania issued a verdict finding a former officer of the NKVD, Pyotr Raslan, guilty of genocide against Lithuanian civilians and sentenced him in absentia, to life in prison. He remained protected by the Russian authorities and in 2004, Vytautas Landsbergis, urged the Lithuanian President, to boycott the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, for this reason (among other reasons).Conservative member European Parliament urges president of Lithuania to decline invitation to Russia - Baltics Documentation The massacre was well documented by both the Lithuanians and the Soviets. Examination of the bodies was done after the exhumation. The full account of the tortures and wounds inflicted on the victims was given by the surgeons who had examined the exhumed bodies, such as Dr. Leonardas Plechaviƒçius and others. After the war Dr. Plechaviƒçius delivered a speech before the US House of Representatives about the massacre. An investigation was carried out. In 1942 the first book about the massacre was published (\\"Raini≈≥ kankiniai\\"). The Soviet authorities attempted to document the events that took place in the first days after Germany invaded \\"Soviet\\" territory. Most of the communists of Lithuania had fled to Russia when the invasion began, some were asked to write their testimonies of the events. The Rainiai massacre was explained in the testimonies of the communists who were based in Tel≈°iai. The leaders of Lithuanian SSR asked the perpetrators of the massacre to write these testimonies after Antanas Bimba, a Lithuanian communist who was living in United States and sending aid to USSR, found out about the massacre and demanded an explanation.

Its vision is that everyone has the opportunity to optimise their health and wellbeing. RSPH's Chief Executive is Shirley Cramer CBE, while its current president is Professor Lord Patel of Bradford; current vice presidents are Natasha Kaplinsky OBE and Michael Sheen OBE. It has a Royal Charter, with Her Majesty the Queen as its Patron, and is governed by a Council of Trustees, all of whom are RSPH members. History The Sanitary Institute was established in 1876 following the landmark Public Health Act of 1875. In 1904, it was tagged Royal Sanitary Institute which name it held until 1955. The Sanitary Institute was created during a period of great change within the areas of public health provision and sanitary reform to which it contributed significantly. During its first fifty years, the (Royal) Sanitary Institute became the leading public health organization both in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. It was soon renowned for events and conferences on pioneering and topical issues, and developed qualifications for people working in public health professions. In 1955, the name was changed to Royal Society of Health. By the 1950s, the Society was a leading authority in its field, and was regularly consulted by governments and the international press on health-related issues. Since the 1970s, the Society has focused its activities on the most successful areas of its work - examinations, certification, and the journals Public Health and Perspectives in Public Health. The RSPH was formed with the merger of the Royal Society of Health and the Royal Institute of Public Health in October 2008, under the previous Chief Executive, Professor Richard Parish, CBE. The Royal Society of Health was also known as the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health. Today, RSPH is the longest-established public health organisation in the United Kingdom. It is incorporated by Royal Charter completely independent of government and of any special interest. Members are academics, health professionals and practitioners who share an interest in promoting health through their daily work, and come together through RSPH membership to provide cross-cutting, multi-disciplinary perspectives on current health questions.  Membership  RSPH has a membership of over 6,500 public health professionals, with representation from over 90 countries worldwide, encompassing a wide range of sectors and roles including health promotion, medicine, environmental health and food safety trainers. Membership is open to anyone working in the area of public health or with an interest in it. It is a widely recognised mark of commitment to public health and brings real professional benefits. There are four grades of RSPH membership, each aimed at supporting public health professionals at the different stages of their careers: Student; Associate (AMRSPH); Member (MRSPH); and Fellow (FRSPH).  Qualifications  RSPH provides a wide range of vocationally related qualifications that are directly relevant to the workplace and national health priorities. Around 50,000 students qualify through a network of UK-wide registered training centres in qualifications in the following subjects: * Anatomical pathology technology *Built environment *Emergency planning *Food safety *HACCP *Health and safety * Health improvement *Meat inspection *Nutrition *Pest control *Practice management * Young Health Champions Recognised and regulated to award accredited qualifications by the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual), Qualifications Wales and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA), RSPH is widely acknowledged for its high level of quality assurance, stability, experience and expertise.  Conferences and training  RSPH hosts an annual programme of conferences, webinars, events and training in subjects including water hygiene, infection control, food safety and mental wellbeing. RSPH also runs a two-week intensive preparation course for the Faculty of Occupational Medicine's Diploma exam.  Accreditation  RSPH has been running accreditation services continuously since 1904, endorsing products, services and more recently campaigns, which contribute to improvements in hygiene, public health and safety. It has three accreditation services: one for campaigns, one for training programmes and one for university modules, which are either in-house or provided by third sector organisations. The common theme is maintaining high standards of hygiene, public health and safety.  Campaigning  Public health encompasses all aspects of health protection and health promotion and this is reflected throughout RSPH's projects, policy work, reports and campaigns. RSPH is dedicated to raising awareness of issues that affect the public's health and, through high profile campaigns, it draws attention to particular issues, calling a wide range of organisations, local authorities and government to make changes that will improve health and wellbeing for all. Recent campaigns include: * Health on the High Street. The objective of this campaign was to help businesses and local authorities to improve the health of their communities. * Life on Debt Row. Backed by a report examining the effect of debt on health and wellbeing, this campaign called for action from the UK government and industry to protect the health and wellbeing of credit users. * #StatusOfMind. Supported by a report examining the positive and negative effects of social media on young people‚Äôs health, this campaign called for action from government, social media companies and policy makers to help promote the positive aspects of social media for young people, whilst mitigating the potential negatives. * Taking a New Line on Drugs. With reference to the wider ‚Äòdrugscape‚Äô of legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, the report underpinning this campaign sets out a new vision for a holistic public health-led approach to drugs policy at a UK-wide level.  Programmes  RSPH works with a range of national and regional partners to develop, support and implement programmes and initiatives aimed at supporting the public‚Äôs health and wellbeing. RSPH's key programmes include: * Alcohol Health Champions. RSPH has supported the implementation of the Communities In Charge of Alcohol (CICA) scheme in Manchester which trains local volunteers to become accredited ‚ÄòAlcohol Health Champions‚Äô and provide opportunistic advice and mobilise action on alcohol availability at a community level. It is the first time that a devolved UK region has attempted to coordinate an approach to building health champion capacity, presenting an opportunity to grow its implementation and impact at scale. * Connect 5. Connect 5 is an education programme that is designed to increase the confidence and core skills of front line staff so that they can have more effective conversations about mental health and wellbeing, help people to manage mental health problems, and increase their resilience and mental wellbeing through positive changes. RSPH has trained over 200 Connect 5 trainers across England who are currently cascading training with their colleagues, service users and communities. * Healthy Living Pharmacies. RSPH manages the national Healthy Living Pharmacy Level 1 register which holds over 9,000 Healthy Living Pharmacies in England, as well as quality assuring the profession-led self-assessment process. Developed by the Pharmacy and Public Health Forum and Public Health England, the scheme is aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of the local population through the consistent delivery of interventions through community pharmacies. * Young Health Champions. The Young Health Champions (YHCs) initiative is a peer-driven approach to raising public health awareness among young people, providing them with the skills and knowledge to act as health mentors in their local communities. YHCs are required to achieve the RSPH Level 2 Young Health Champion Award and there is now a national network of over 2,000 YHCs across the UK.  Journals  RSPH publishes two widely respected peer-reviewed journals on public health, Perspectives in Public Health and Public Health. * Public Health. Public Health is one of the world‚Äôs oldest public health journals, having been in continuous publication since 1888.

Foundation The estate was settled in 1700 by an early Governor of the Cape, Willem Adriaan van der Stel. Van der Stel used the resources of his employer, the Dutch East India Company, to improve the estate, and in 1706 a number of free burghers at the Cape drew up a formal memorandum complaining about van der Stel's illegal activities. This memorandum contains some of the earliest images and descriptions of the estate. As a consequence of the free burghers' complaints, van der Stel and other officials were sacked, and three-quarters of the original Vergelegen estate was sold off, drastically reducing the size of the property. Vineyards In 1798 the estate was sold to the Theunissen family, who planted extensive vineyards and concentrated on the production of grapes until an infestation by the phylloxera louse in the late nineteenth century wiped out most of Vergelegen's grape production. Sir Lionel Phillips In 1917 Vergelegen was purchased by the millionaire mine magnate Sir Lionel Phillips as a present for his wife Florence. She remodeled aspects of the house and planted the magnificent gardens, but removed the few remaining acres dedicated to grapes. \\"Punch\\" Barlow and Anglo American Following the death of Lady Phillips the estate was purchased by the Barlow family, and Charles \\"Punch\\" Barlow oversaw the reintroduction of limited planting of grapes. However, by the time Anglo American bought the property from Barlow's son in 1987, no grapes were being cultivated. Wine production Anglo American concentrated on the production of high-quality wines from Vergelegen. The first vintage under the company's stewardship was harvested in 1992. Within ten years the estate was recognised as producing some of South Africa's finest wines, with the cabernet sauvignon blend Vergelegen, single-vineyard cabernet sauvignon Vergelegen V and semillon/sauvignon blanc blend Vergelegen White regularly achieving a maximum five stars in John Platter's annual Guide to South African Wines. The estate Vergelegen's Cape Dutch house, gardens and winery are open to visitors. Interesting features of any visit include a trip up the mountain to the winery plant, and a walk under the vast Camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) planted by Willem van der Stel in about 1705 which have been declared a protected provincial heritage site. The winery is uniquely shaped in an octagon form that is mirrored on the vineyard's labels.

It was fought between the forces of the Polish Army and the German Wehrmacht during the Invasion of Poland. It was one of the last battles in European warfare in which cavalry was used on both sides. Battle At approximately 7am a group of Polish cavalry of the Nowogr√≥dek Cavalry Brigade left the forests halfway between Zamo≈õƒá and Tomasz√≥w Lubelski. The 25th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment under Col. Bogdan Stachlewski formed the front guard of the formation and was entrusted with recapturing the pivotal town of Krasnobr√≥d. The German 8th Infantry Division fortified the town located on a hill with two lines of trenches. In order to minimize the effect of enemy numerical superiority, the Polish commander split his forces in two and ordered a cavalry charge, with each of the squadrons charging separately at a different sector of the front. The German forces were caught completely by surprise and the first squadron successfully broke through their positions, while the German infantry started a chaotic retreat towards the centre of the town, followed by the Polish cavalry using sabres and lances. The second squadron under Lt. Tadeusz Gerlecki joined the charge towards the hill. A unit of organic cavalry from the German 8th Infantry Division counter- charged from the hill, but was repelled in what was one of the last cavalry battles in World War II. The Polish units started a pursuit after the fleeing enemy and entered the city. Although the Poles suffered heavy losses due to machine gun fire (with Gerlecki's squadron losing all but 30 men), the town was retaken and the Poles took the headquarters of the division, together with about 100 German soldiers. Forty Polish combatants previously taken prisoner by the Germans were freed.

The only person to be executed in Sweden following the instatement of the guillotine, he remains the only person executed by this means in Swedish history (before 1907, capital punishment was executed through manual beheading). Early life Born in Ljuster√∂, Ander performed his military service duties from 1893 to 1894 at the Vaxholm Artillery Corps of Vaxholm. When his military service was over he got married and tried to make a living as a waiter and hotel owner. Most of the businesses failed however (both in Str√§ngn√§s in 1898 and in Helsinki in 1903). There have been claims that Ander's excessive drinking and mistreatment of his wife were, at least partially, the reasons for the economic failures. In 1900, he was imprisoned for a few small crimes but managed to escape. In all, by the time of his final conviction, he had been sentenced three times for theft (tredje resan st√∂ld). In 1909, the couple moved back to Ander's parents' house in Karlsudd. The robbery and arrest Ander sought a way to find a solution to his money problems, and for weeks he had been seen observing an exchange agency, Gerells V√§xelkontor on Malmtorgsgatan 3 in Stockholm. On 5 January 1910, he robbed the agency and beat the clerk, Victoria Hellsten, so severely that she died. He managed to steal 6,000 Swedish kronor in Swedish and foreign notes at the agency (nearly 200,000 SEK in 2010 equivalent). Staff at a hotel named Temperance, which was located near the exchange agency, reported to the police that one of their guests had been behaving in a very strange and anxious manner, and that this guest had left the hotel with an oblong package.http://www.polismuseet.se/Samlingar/Kriminalhistoria/Alfred-Ander--- den-sista-avrattningen/ The guest turned out to be Alfred Ander. A large suitcase found in his hotel room contained numerous items that could be connected to the murder, among them the murdered clerk's wallet as well as most of the stolen money, partially blood-stained. Ander was subsequently arrested during nighttime near Vaxholm, in his father's house, after some inquiries to workers on the archipelago ferries, who recognized Ander and remembered where he went. The oblong package which had been observed by hotel staff was also found during the arrest and contained the apparent murder weapon, a steelyard balance. Trial and execution During the trial, Ander claimed that he had received the money from a foreign (and unknown) man, whom he had met during his stay at a hotel in Stockholm. He never admitted to the crime, but was sentenced to death by all court instances, and he never appealed to the king to be reprieved (however, an application for clemency was made by his father). Clemency was refused by king Gustaf V, thus making Ander the first person to be executed in Sweden in almost ten years. The execution took place at L√•ngholmen Prison in Stockholm on 23 November 1910 by a new guillotine imported from France, the only instance in which it was used in Sweden. Ander appeared mostly calm during the execution, even greeting the execution team with \\"God morgon, mina herrar!\\" (\\"Good morning, gentlemen!\\") He also asked to say a few last words, but was, surprisingly, denied to do so by the executioner. Shortly thereafter, Ander was ordered to lay down on the guillotine, to which he complied without any need for force. The rope was then pulled. Ander reportedly shuddered just before his head fell into the zinc bucket fastened onto the guillotine. It was the first execution in Sweden in more than a decade, and the last ever to be carried out. Ander's body was donated to science. Doctors concluded that, at the time of his death, he suffered from tuberculosis, and they also found a large chunk of porcelain in his stomach, likely from an in-prison suicide attempt prior to the execution. The executioner was Albert Gustaf Dahlman, thus the last official executioner to carry out his duties. His death in 1920 was considered levying the pressure to abolish capital punishment in Sweden, which took place the following year. A further 10 to 15 people were sentenced to death (but they were either reprieved or committed suicide; the most notorious being Hilda Nilsson in 1917). The last woman to have been executed in Sweden was Anna M√•nsdotter, beheaded by manual blade in 1890, also by Albert Gustav Dahlman.

As a Soviet republic, the Lithuanian SSR did not have a state border with customs or checkpoints. The newly declared Republic of Lithuania began establishing the State Border Guard Service, before it was internationally recognized on 27 August 1991 by the states of the European Community.http://www.litauen-info.de/land-und-leute/geschichte These posts also became a symbol of its struggle for independence. The Soviet government viewed the customs posts as illegal and sent the OMON (Special Purpose Police Unit) troops against the posts, especially those along the eastern border with Belarus. The unarmed custom officers and policemen were harassed, beaten or killed, their cars were stolen or bombed, the posts were burned down or wrecked, and work of the checkpoints was otherwise disrupted. Two of the incidents resulted in the deaths of eight Lithuanian citizens. In total, about 60 officers were attacked and injured, and 23 border posts were burned or destroyed. Early attacks The first incident occurred on 17 December 1990 in Ei≈°i≈°kƒós. Shift leader Petras Pumputis was beaten, lost consciousness, and was taken to a hospital with a cerebral hemorrhage. The first organized attacks were organized following the events of 11‚Äì13 January 1991 in Vilnius when 14 civilians were killed near the Vilnius TV Tower. Soviet troops attacked and burned border posts in Medininkai and Lavori≈°kƒós on 27 January. On 1 March, OMON troops fired at a border guard bus returning from Vilnius. Three Lithuanian guards were injured. In mid-May 1991, various incidents were reported almost daily. On 18 May, Belarusian police captain A. Fiyaz (A. –§–∏—è–∑—å) fired at a Lithuanian post in ≈†alƒçininkai with a TT pistol; Fiyaz was killed when a Lithuanian officer returned fire with a hunting rifle. Fearing retaliation, the Lithuanian officers were ordered to leave their posts. Officer Gintaras ≈Ωagunis did not leave his station in Krak≈´nai and was killed on 19 May. ≈Ωagunis was given a public funeral in the Antakalnis Cemetery. The same night two other posts were burned down. On 23 May, OMON troops from Riga assaulted border posts on the Lithuanian‚ÄìLatvian border in , Ma≈æeikiai, , Saloƒçiai, . Five Latvian posts were also attacked. The attack on Smƒólynƒó was filmed by Alexander Nevzorov and later shown on Leningrad TV. Following these attacks, Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius officially complained to Boris Pugo, Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs in charge of OMON troops. Moscow denied responsibility for the attacks and claimed that the OMON troops acted without their approval. Mikhail Gorbachev disclaimed any knowledge of the attacks and ordered Pugo to investigate. However, on 24 and 25 May five more posts were assaulted. Lithuania appealed to western countries asking to protest about the actions of the Soviet government. Moscow continued to deny responsibility, but admitted that the actions of OMON troops were criminal. Despite promises to intervene, the attacks continued through mid-June. On 28 June, Moscow took the first actions to discipline OMON ‚Äì its leaders were called to explain themselves and were reassigned. Medininkai incident Monument to the seven Lithuanian customs officers killed on 31 July 1991 in Medininkai The most serious attack occurred when OMON troops from Riga attacked the Lithuanian customs post in Medininkai on the Vilnius‚ÄìMinsk highway on 31 July 1991. It is thought that the attack took place around 04:00 because a watch belonging to one of the victims stopped at this hour. Seven officers were shot and killed: Mindaugas Balavakas and Algimantas Juozakas (officers of the Special Division ARAS), Juozas Janonis and Algirdas Kazlauskas (officers of the highway police), Antanas Musteikis, Stanislovas Orlaviƒçius and Riƒçardas Rabaviƒçius (customs officers). Rabaviƒçius died on 2 August in hospital. The only survivor, customs officer Tomas ≈†ernas, suffered severe brain damage and became disabled. The ARAS officers were supposed to provide protection to the post and were armed. However, their weapons were missing from the scene and there were no signs of returned fire. The Lithuanian officers were forced to lie down on the ground and then shot in the head, execution style. Those killed were buried in the Antakalnis Cemetery. The victims were awarded the Cross of Vytis (6 September 1991) and the Medal of 13 January (9 January 1992). The incident occurred during US President George H. W. Bush's two-day visit in Moscow. Bush specifically addressed the incident in one of the press conferences, but downplayed its importance in the Lithuanian struggle for international recognition and shielded Gorbachev from responsibility. It was speculated that the assailants wanted to embarrass Gorbachev showcasing his inability to control the situation in the dissolving Soviet Union. The attack might have been a response to a treaty between Lithuania and Boris Yeltsin, newly elected President of Russian SFSR. The treaty established formal diplomatic relations and addressed economic and cultural issues between Lithuania and Russia; it was seen as an important step towards recognition of Lithuania's independence. Another version claims that the guards discovered a large smuggling operation.  Investigation and trials  The attacks stopped after the executions in Medininkai, save for an attack on a post in Kybartai on 22 August 1991 during the August Coup in Moscow. After the coup failed, the Soviet Union disintegrated. Members of OMON dispersed throughout the former union, many of them becoming citizens of Russia. The Lithuanian government attempted to investigate the attacks and prosecute the suspects, but the efforts were hindered by complex extradition requests. In December 1991, the Lithuanians presented to Russia a list of more than 20 people wanted for their involvement in January Events and Medininkai incident. However, the Lithuanians were refused even requests to question witnesses. In December 2006, the Lithuanian prosecutors issued a European Arrest Warrant for Latvian citizen Konstantin Nikulin, a suspect in the Medininkai killings. He was arrested by Latvian police on 28 November 2007. Nikulin had already been tried and received a suspended sentence of 2.5 years in 2004 for his involvement in the January 1991 events in Latvia. After the trial, Nikulin became a key witness to an unrelated murder and changed his surname to Konstantin Mikhailov (Konstantinas Michailovas) as part of a witness protection program. On 28 January 2008, the Supreme Court of Latvia decided to extradite Mikhailov to Lithuania, and he was jailed in the Luki≈°kƒós Prison awaiting trial. The case has some 220 witnesses and volumes of written material. The statute of limitations for murder is 20 years; thus the expiration date would be July 2011. On 11 May 2011, Mikhailov was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mikhailov appealed against the decision claiming innocence while Lithuanian prosecutors appealed against the decision hoping to convict Mikhailov of crimes against humanity. On 6 June 2016, the Appeals Court upheld the life imprisonment sentence and reclassified the crime from murder to \\"acts against people prohibited by international law\\" (Article 100 of the Criminal Code of Lithuania). Mikhailov appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Lithuania which started its proceedings on 11 January 2017. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction on 28 February, but Mikhailov submitted an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. Other suspects in the Medininkai case, namely commander Czeslaw Mlynnik (ƒåeslavas Mlinykas), Alexander Ryzhov (Aleksandras Ry≈æovas), and Andrei Laktionov (Andrejus Laktionovas), are citizens of Russia and have not been extradited. In 2009, Ryzhov was tried for organized crime and armed robbery in Saint Petersburg, and in June 2011 he received a 15-year sentence. In December 2010, Lithuanian amended its Criminal Code to allow in absentia trials in cases of crimes against humanity. In June 2013, the Lithuanians completed pre-trial procedures in absentia for a trial of the three men for crimes against humanity. Lithuania has issued European Arrest Warrants for the three men. All three were sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in October 2016; they are also liable to pay 653,850 euros to the state to cover expenses of state funerals, benefits and pensions to relatives, medical expenses of the survivors, etc. as well as a further 100,000 euros in compensation to each parent, spouse, and child of the killed men. Another suspect, Igor Gorban, was identified by the only survivor Tomas ≈†ernas during Gorban's 2004 trial in Riga. However, Gorban was not charged due to lack of evidence. Another in absentia trial concerns Vilnius OMON commanders Boleslav Makutynovich (Boleslavas Makutynoviƒçius) and Vladimir Razvodov (Vladimiras Razvodovas). They are not implicated in the Medininkai massacre, but are accused of ordering assaults on other border posts and other actions aimed at intimidating the public (in total, 15 specific instances). In July 2015, Vilnius District Court found them not guilty. The decision was appealed by Lithuanian prosecutors. According to unconfirmed reports, Makutynovich died in November 2015. On 24 January 2017, the Appeals Court ruled that the District Court improperly interpreted that crimes against humanity could be committed only in a time of war or other armed conflict and sentenced Razvodov to 12 years imprisonment and 14,000 euros in compensation for damages. Razvodov is believed to live in Russia and Lithuania has issued a European Arrest Warrant for him.

The street forms the main eastern length of the Royal Mile while the district is the main eastern section of Edinburgh's Old Town. It began when David I of Scotland, by the Great Charter of Holyrood Abbey c.1143, authorised the Abbey to found a burgh separate from EdinburghBest Hop On Hop Off Edinburgh between the Abbey and Edinburgh. The burgh of Canongate that developed was controlled by the Abbey until the Scottish Reformation when it came under secular control. In 1636 the adjacent city of Edinburgh bought the feudal superiority of the Canongate but it remained a semi-autonomous burgh under its own administration of bailies chosen by Edinburgh magistrates, until its formal incorporation into the city in 1856. The burgh gained its name from the route that the canons of Holyrood Abbey took to Edinburgh - the canons' way or the canons' gait, from the Scots word gait meaning \\"way\\". In more modern times, the eastern end is sometimes referred to as part of the Holyrood area of the city. Canongate Burgh Cross in the grounds of the Canongate Kirk The Canongate contains several historic buildings including Queensberry House, now incorporated in the Scottish Parliament Building complex, Huntly House (now the Museum of Edinburgh), the Canongate Tolbooth (now housing the People's Story Museum) and the Canongate Kirk, opened in 1691 replacing Holyrood Abbey as the parish church of the Canongate. The church is still used for Sunday services as well as weekday concerts. Early history The Canongate owes its existence to the establishment of Holyrood Abbey in 1128. King David I, who established the Abbey, gave the surrounding area to the Augustinian canons then resident at Edinburgh Castle in the form of a regality.A Treatise On The History, Law, And Privileges Of The Palace And Sanctuary Of Holyrood House The King also gave leave to the canons to establish a burgh between the abbey and Edinburgh, and as it was the only burgh within the regality it was given the status of burgh of regality of Canongate. The area originally controlled by the abbey included the lands of Broughton, areas around the Pleasance and North Leith, giving the canons access to a port. Holyrood Palace was developed from the 14th century onwards as successive monarchs made increasing use of the Abbey for political events such as parliaments and royal councils. The word \\"Pallais\\" appears in a reference to the royal lodgings in the reign of James IV, but they were first converted to palace buildings by James V in 1525.J Mackay, History of the Burgh of Canongate, Edinburgh 1886, p.7 The Canongate Tolbooth, erected in 1591 The burgh of Canongate had a sometimes turbulent relationship with its neighbour, Edinburgh. The main reason for this was the continual battle over their exact boundaries up until their unification in 1856, an event which proved unpopular with the former's townsfolk.Susan Varga: Edinburgh Old Town (2006) King James VI of Scotland's accession to the throne of England in 1603 began the long and slow decline of the Canongate. The loss of the royal court from the Holyrood Palace inevitably affected the wealth of the surrounding area. This was compounded by the union of the parliaments in 1707, as up until then Edinburgh had been the location of the Parliament of Scotland with the Canongate providing a fashionable suburb for the dwellings of the political class. The North Bridge, finally opened in 1772, provided a new and more convenient route from Edinburgh to the port of Leith effectively bypassing the Canongate which had until then been the main route from Edinburgh to Leith via Easter Road causing even more neglect to the residential area which was gradually taken over by industrial premises including breweries and a large gasworks. The Canongate was an important district during the Scottish Enlightenment partly because of the presence of the Canongate Theatre (1746-1786), of which one of the proprietors was Lord Monboddo. The philosopher David Hume performed in a play staged there.Cloyd, E.L., James Burnett, Lord Monboddo (1972) Writing in 1824, Robert Chambers said of the Canongate, \\"As the main avenue from the palace into the city, it has borne upon its pavements the burden of all that was beautiful, all that was gallant, all that has become historically interesting in Scotland for the last six or seven hundred years\\".Hamish Coghill, Edinburgh: The Old Town (1990) Sir Walter Scott writing in 1827 stated; \\"Sic itur ad Astra; This is the path to heaven. Such is the ancient motto attached to the armorial bearings of the Canongate, and which is inscribed, with greater or less propriety, upon all the public buildings, from the church to the pillory, in the ancient quarter of Edinburgh which bears, or rather once bore, the same relation to the Good Town that Westminster does to London\\". Modern era Sugarhouse Close is an example of a modern development in the Canongate. Note the renovated brewery buildings. The area has seen various attempts at improvements and slum clearance, including various schemes by Ebenezer James MacRae in the 1930s and Sir Robert HurdBuildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Colin McWilliam in the 1950s in traditional style replicating original facades. Another scheme, completed in 1969, by the Basil Spence practice was in modern style but in proportion to surrounding buildings. Due to the redevelopments of the 1950s/60s the overcrowded and impoverished area suffered from serious depopulation. From the 1960s onwards the Canongate area became notably less industrial, with all of the breweries closing. Residential redevelopment began on former industrial sites in the 1990s and 2000s with flats, offices and other commercial operations being built south of the main road, reversing the decline in population. Whilst much of this development has a modern appearance, some attempt has been made in terms of layout to retain the \\"fishbone\\" pattern characteristic of the Royal Mile. As of 2006, the redevelopment of former industrial land to the north of the Canongate, once occupied by Victorian gasworks and a later bus garage, has proved controversial, partly due to the original proposal, now abandoned, to demolish some of the replacement buildings from the 1930s. Above all, the construction of the new Scottish Parliament Building on the site of the old Younger's Abbey Brewery has led to a resurgence of the area's vitality with the Canongate becoming the centre of Scottish political life. Although modern development is arguably of high quality it fails to reflect the traditional character of the area. Education The Royal Mile Primary School - a typical late-Victorian board school The Royal Mile Primary School, formerly known as Milton House Public School, is a non-denominational state school that provides primary education for 5- to 11-year-old children. It was designed in 1886 by Robert Wilson, architect for the Edinburgh Board of Education.Buildings of Scotland, Edinburgh by Gifford McWilliam and Walker Within the school, there is also a nursery which caters for 3- to 5-year-old children. As the school is so central to the Canongate community, its pupils are often involved in illustrious events at the Scottish parliament and Edinburgh Castle. It is used as a polling station for the constituents of Edinburgh Central.Royal Mile Primary School Official Website The Canongate is also the location of Moray House, the Education department of the University of Edinburgh (formerly Moray House College of Education). It comprises a number of buildings centred on St. John Street, some of which are historic, whilst others are purpose built. A number of other university buildings including the Pleasance student union building and the Centre for Sport and Exercise are located in the area historically covered by the Canongate. Historic crosses Site of St. John's Cross There were three crosses on the Canongate section of the Royal Mile. The ancient Mercat Cross (Market Cross) or Burgh Cross is shown on Gordon of Rothiemay's 1647 plan as being in the middle of the road nearly opposite the tolbooth. Gordon shows it as being similar to the Edinburgh Mercat Cross with the shaft and cross mounted on a stone gallery. The much-altered cross now stands in the south-east corner of Canongate Churchyard to the right hand side of the entrance to Canongate Kirk. The St John's Cross used to stand further up the Canongate to the west. The site is now marked by a maltese cross formed by coloured setts in the road surface near the top of St John's Street (). It was known as St. John's Cross because it stood on property thought to belong to the Knights of St. John in the Middle Ages, and it marked the ancient boundary of that part of the Royalty of Edinburgh which lay outwith the Netherbow Port and the city wall. Where the Girth Cross, which has also been called the \\"Abbey\\" or \\"South\\" Cross at various times, once stood is now marked by a radiating circle of setts. (). It marked the western limit of the Girth of Holyrood, \\"the greatest sanctuary in Scotland, and the last to disappear\\". It is shown on a map of the 1573 siege of Edinburgh, published in Holinshed's Chronicles in 1577, as an ornamental shaft elevated on a flight of steps and was not demolished until after 1767. In its shadow proclamations were read and executions were carried out. A notable execution took place next to the cross in 1600 when the young and beautiful Jean Kincaid (Lady Warriston) was beheaded by the Maiden for conspiring in the murder of her abusive husband. Coat of arms Canongate's arms as depicted on the Edinburgh Mercat Cross The coat of arms of the Canongate features a white hart's head and a golden cross, recalling the old legend in which King David I was saved from goring from a stag by the sudden appearance of a holy cross. The arms, though technically obsolete since the abolishment of the burgh of Canongate in 1856, can still be seen in many locations in and around the district, including on Edinburgh's mercat cross where they appear alongside the royal arms of Britain, Scotland, England and Ireland, the burgh arms of Edinburgh and Leith, and the arms of the University. The motto is Sic itur ad astra meaning 'thus you shall go to the stars', a quote from Virgil's Aeneid.

The case addressed privacy protections and age of consent laws for homosexuals (case no. 7215/75, Dec. 12.10.1978). Facts In 1974, a 26-year-old male, anonymously identified as 'X' but subsequently identified as Peter Vernon Wells (1947-79), was arrested in the United Kingdom and charged under The Sexual Offences Act 1967 with two offences of buggery committed with two 18-year-old men. X was sentenced two and a half years of imprisonment on the first count and six months on the second count. There was evidence shown that X had 'virtually made a prisoner' of one of the men he had relationship with; however this was contradicted not only by X but also the man he had a relationship with.X v. United Kingdom, 7215/75 paragraph 31 The applicant in the case, X, contended that his arrest and imprisonment was a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life, and that homosexual relations between consenting adults should not be criminal offences. X also appealed that The Sexual Offences Act 1967, which provided that sexual relations with a male under the age of 21 constituted a crime, was also in violation of Article 14, which prohibits discrimination. X's claim was based on the fact that the Act treated homosexual relations differently from heterosexual relationships, and that it treated male homosexual acts differently from female ones. Judgment The Court ruled unanimously that prosecution and imprisonment of X was not an interference with his right to privacy, because there was an element of force involved in one of the relationships. Therefore, no violation of Article 8 of the ECHR had taken place. On the issue of the Act's age of consent being fixed at 21, the Court ruled eight votes to four that the age of consent laws were not in violation of the human rights convention, because protection of the rights of others was a legitimate aim, and therefore justified. No violation of either Article 8 or Article 14 had taken place. On the issue of discrimination of homosexuals but not heterosexuals in the Act's age of consent provisions, the Court ruled nine votes to two with one abstention that social protection was a \\"objective and reasonable justification\\" for the criminal sanctions, and that no violation of either Article 8 or Article 14 had taken place. On the issue of the Act's difference in its treatment of male and female homosexual acts, the Court ruled eleven votes with one abstention that, citing German studies which describe \\"a specific social danger in the case of masculine homosexuality\\", and that male homosexuals as having \\"a clear tendency to proselytise adolescents\\", the Act's aims were justified, and no violation of either Article 8 or Article 14 had taken place.

He was the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team from 2005 to 2007. He was previously the head coach at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Southern Methodist University, and Colorado College, and was an assistant with the national team. In 1983, Ryan entered the coaching ranks, while still playing, when he served as an assistant coach with Colorado College men's soccer team. Ryan retired from playing after the first MISL season of the Sting in 1985 and moved to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he coached in various capacities until 1993. In 1991, he was named the women's college coach of the year. In 1996, he moved to Southern Methodist University where he compiled a 37‚Äì21‚Äì5 record as the women's soccer coach. In 1999, he moved back to Colorado College. The national team finished first in first-round group play in the 2007 Women's World Cup held in China. In the quarterfinals, the team defeated England 3‚Äì0. Heading into the semifinal match against Brazil, Ryan decided to bench regular goalkeeper Hope Solo in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry. The team subsequently lost to Brazil 0‚Äì4 (the worst defeat in the team's history) and Ryan received considerable criticism for the sudden lineup change as well as defensive-minded substitutions made when the team arguably needed more offensive players to compete against the Brazilians. On Monday October 22, 2007 U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati announced that Ryan's contract would not be extended past its December 31, 2007 expiration date. Ryan accepted the position of head coach for the University of Michigan women's soccer team on Feb. 1, 2008. He became the second head coach in the program's 14-year history. After the team posted losing seasons in his first two years at the helm, the Michigan women's team qualified for the NCAA tournament in 2010 but lost in the first round. In 2012, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, and in 2013, they made it to the Elite Eight. Through seven seasons at Michigan, Ryan's record is 75‚Äì46‚Äì23.

It is an account of MacNiven's journey walking and backpacking the entire length of Japan from Ky≈´sh≈´ to Hokkaid≈ç, more than 2000 miles in 145 days. MacNiven cited three reasons for the journey. On his first trip to Japan in 2002, he fell in love with the country. It was on this trip that a friend nicknamed him \\"Kintaro,\\" which means \\"Golden Boy,\\" because of his blond hair. Occasionally accompanying him on the trip was his girlfriend, Ayumi, whose father, George Meegan, completed the longest unbroken walk in recorded history - a nearly 7-year sojourn from the southern tip of Argentina to the northern tip of Alaska. Inspired by their story, MacNiven conceived of the task after learning that his father, whose parents were foreign missionaries, was born in an unknown location in Hokkaid≈ç. Armed with a desire to impress Ayumi and find his father's birthplace, as well as an interest in Japanese culture, MacNiven set sail to Japan. With only a drawing of the birthplace to aid him, MacNiven walked the length of Japan with hope of finding his father's birthplace. Along the way, he befriended many Japanese people and learned much about their culture and himself. As well, his time spent in Japan helped him learn a fair amount of Japanese. Although he completed his task in July 2004, it wasn't until the subsequent year that Kintaro Walks Japan was disseminated on the internet and gained popularity. Unable to find a distributor for the documentary of the trek, MacNiven burned 1,000 DVDs and began hawking copies of the film on the streets of San Francisco and at a restaurant his father owns. One day, George Strompolos, an executive from the nearby Google campus, dropped by. ‚ÄúDad showed the movie to him,‚Äù MacNiven said. ‚ÄúHe watched it and said, ‚ÄòThis is exactly what we need.‚Äô\\" Today roughly 500 people watch the film every day at Google Video.

Biography Street was born in Farmington, Connecticut in 1775. In 1787, after his father's murder in New York state, he came to live with his uncle, Samuel Street, in Chippawa. He worked with his uncle and later entered business on his own, forming a partnership with Thomas Clark around 1798. He established a number of sawmills and gristmills in the Niagara region, mainly in partnership with Clark. The gristmills processed wheat produced on farms in the region; these mills, by virtue of their location, were the major source of flour production in Upper Canada. Several of their mills were burned by the Americans during the War of 1812 but they were eventually compensated for these losses. Street also profited as a major money lender. He became a major share-holder in the Bank of Upper Canada and the Gore Bank; he also held shares in the Bank of Montreal and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. With William Hamilton Merritt, he acquired shares in the Welland Canal Company. He also had extensive land holdings, some acquired via foreclosures on loans and via sales of land to recover unpaid taxes. When Clark died in 1837, Street became sole owner of the mills and also expanded into textile mills. He died at Port Robinson in 1844. His son, Thomas Clark Street, became a lawyer, businessman and political figure in the Niagara region and also took over his father's business interests.

It lies on the Ellesmere Port to Warrington Line with services operated by Northern Trains. The station is surrounded by the refinery site, so as a result most station users are refinery employees. It is currently the least used railway station in Cheshire and Great Britain, tied with Denton in Greater Manchester. History Stanlow & Thornton track layout in 1975 The station was opened on 23 December 1940 jointly by the Great Western Railway and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The station served the Shell Thornton Aero Engine Laboratory (AEL), which was responsible for developing fuels and oils for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force. A short distance from the station was a signal box. This controlled all of the sidings used for freight. Shell stopped using rail as a method of transportation of goods, and subsequently, the sidings were removed. Eventually, the signal box was dismantled and donated to the Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway. Today, the signals for this line and station are controlled at Helsby and Ellesmere Port signal boxes, operated by Network Rail. The station was originally earmarked for closure under what is known today as the Beeching Axe, a report created by Dr. Beeching entitled \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\". This was a report commissioned by the government to find out how money could be saved, as use of the railways began to decline. Station usage statistics for 2004-5 showed 40 passengers using the station, less than one per week. Passenger numbers began to increase at the station in 2005-6, with 130 people using it in 2005-06. This rose sharply to 326 in 2006-2007, despite the same rail services being operated. In January 2020 the station was named as the joint quietest in the UK, alongside Denton Station in Greater Manchester, with just 46 entries and exits in the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. Facilities The steps lead down to the refinery site At this station there are covered shelters, with three metal seats on either platform. There is a payphone located on the Helsby platform. A gently rising footpath leads from the road to a flight of 48 steps with 2 rest landings and a handrail onto a footbridge. From the footbridge to the left, the first flight of 30 steps with rest landing and handrail leads to the Helsby platform, and the second flight of 30 steps with rest landing and handrail leads to the Ellesmere Port platform. The station is definitely not accessible for people with mobility problems. The now-defunct booking office at Stanlow & Thornton The booking office is still extant at the Ellesmere Port platform, but has been closed for some time. It now houses the electrics for the station and is boarded up. Although not controlled by Northern Trains, the station does have CCTV monitored by the security services at the Essar oil refinery. There is limited car parking at the entrance of the station. The station is unstaffed with no ticket office so passengers buy tickets from a conductor on board the train.  Services  Three trains per day call at the station in each direction (towards and ). Two of the Helsby-bound trains (one early morning and the single service each evening) continue to Warrington Bank Quay, Manchester Victoria and whilst the first morning train of the day starts from Liverpool Lime Street and the afternoon one from Leeds. The Saturday service is effectively the same as the Monday - Friday equivalent, except that all services begin and terminate at Helsby. There is no service on Sundays. A Normal service operates on most Bank Holidays. The North Cheshire Rail User Group, supports and actively campaigns for an improved service at this station and for this railway line. Public transport interchange The station is located on Oil Sites Road, a private road owned by Essar Oil. This is now closed to motor vehicles, except for access to the site. The original owner, Shell, had cited increased commercial traffic to its refinery and the number of public vehicles using the road, recklessly in some cases, as reasons for closure. The road previously also allowed quick access to the villages of Ince and Elton from Ellesmere Port and beyond. Although it is theoretically accessible by foot, it involves a long walk from either Ellesmere Port, Ince or Elton. There are no bus or taxi services at this station due to the access restrictions.

The aircraft had crashed and been abandoned in the conflict between Libya and Chad. In 1988 two U.S. MH-47 Chinooks of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flew almost at night to the site and retrieved the helicopter without being detected. The mission was conducted entirely within Chad, with the approval of the government of Chad.  Operation  In April 1987, a retreating, fully armed Libyan Air Force Mi-25 was captured by French and Chadian military troops after the crew abandoned the helicopter. The Hind was put in storage in Ouadi Doum. The United States Department of State negotiated with Government of Chad to conduct an operation to retrieve the Hind and received permission. The Chadians would not provide assistance. Training was conducted at White Sands Missile Range. The operation was initiated on 10 June 1988. A C-5 Galaxy landed at N'Djamena International Airport with two MH-47s in the cargo hold and 75 troops. French troops also assisted in the operation with one contingent of troops and a few Mirage F.1s. The Chinooks were offloaded and the troops started flying towards Ouadi Doum; the Hind was still parked there. The crew evaded detection by the Libyans and retrieved the Hind and started flying back toward N'Djamena with assistance from two C-130 Hercules at two FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) points; one in Faya-Largeau and one in Moussoro. Despite sandstorms, the Chinooks reached the FARPs and returned to N'Djamena with the Hind. The Mi-25 Hind was loaded onto a C-5 and the Chinooks on another C-5 and transported to the United States.

Family He married Gladys Eileen Trevaskis (1901-1977) on 8 October 1921.Deaths: Coventry, The Age, (Thursday, 11 November 1976), p.27. West Coast of Tasmania Originally from Diamond Creek, Victoria, Coventry journeyed across the Bass Strait after the First World War to work in the mines at Queenstown, Tasmania, taking with him a reputation as a fine footballer. Coventry first played for a Queenstown based team in 1919, but was appointed Captain of the Miners team from Gormanston for the 1920 season. The team played in the Queenstown based ‚ÄòLyell Miners Football Association‚Äô which included 9 teams. Gormanston was a small miners town at the top of Mount Lyell. The footballers in the region are noted as some of the hardiest in Australia given the weather and playing conditions, which include the famous Gravel Oval at Queenstown. https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/68031032?searchTerm=syd%20coventry%20football&searchLimits;=l-state=Tasmania St Kilda While still in Queenstown Coventry was approached by St Kilda who wanted him to play for them in 1921. Collingwood Syd duly agreed, but when he returned to Melbourne he was persuaded by his younger brother Gordon Coventry, who had just finished his first season with Collingwood, to reconsider. Apart from the issue of family loyalty, there was the small matter of the excessive distance between Diamond Creek and St Kilda to think of. The upshot of it all was that Syd Coventry elected to throw in his lot with Collingwood, whereupon St Kilda, not surprisingly, screamed \\"foul!\\" The VFL Permits Committee was called in to adjudicate, and Coventry was faced with the choice of playing with St Kilda, or sitting out of football for twelve months so that he could join the Woods. He opted for the latter course of action, and in 1922 he started out on an illustrious thirteen season, 227 game league career with Collingwood. Despite standing only 180 cm in height, Syd Coventry played mainly as a ruckman, where his aggression, vigour and dynamism more than compensated for any deficiency in stature. A born leader, he captained the Magpies from 1927 until he moved to Footscray as coach at the end of the 1934 season. He thus enjoyed the unique privilege of captaining four successive VFL premiership teams. Often at his best when the going was rough, one of Syd Coventry's finest performances came on a waterlogged MCG in the 1927 grand final, when Collingwood and Richmond between them could manage only 3 goals for the match. The 1927 season also saw him win both the Brownlow Medal and Collingwood's best and fairest award. He repeated the second achievement five years later. Coventry till this day remains the only Premiership Captain to win a Brownlow in the same year. For good measure, he was named the best player in that year's Grand Final. As a Captain, Syd led Collingwood Football Club in 144 games. In that period Collingwood won 111 games, drew twice and lost 31 times. A winning ratio 77 percent, a VFL/AFL record for many years, since beaten by Tom Harley with a 49-7 win-loss record as Captain of Geelong in 2007-2009, a winning ratio of 87.5 percent. A virtual ever-present in VFL representative teams for most of his career, Coventry made a total of 27 interstate appearances. His eventual departure from Victoria Park to coach Footscray came with the blessing of the Collingwood committee, but only on the proviso that he did not continue as a player. Footscray After two unsuccessful and unhappy years with Footscray (1934‚Äì1935), Syd Coventry returned to Collingwood in an administrative capacity. Collingwood committeeman He served as club vice-president from 1939 to 1949, and as president between 1950 and 1962. From 1963 until 1976 he was Collingwood's patron, rounding off more than fifty years of involvement with the club. In 1969 the Collingwood Football Club named the newly built social club stand at Victoria Park S.A Coventry Pavilion. In 1992 the Melbourne Cricket Club named Gate 7 after Coventry (& his brother) as part of the Great Southern Stand development at the MCG. In 1996 Coventry was inducted into the first batch of players and officials in the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Two of Syd's sons played for Collingwood: Hugh Coventry played for a year before enlisting in the RAAF and was awarded with a Distinguished Flying Cross; another son, Syd Coventry, Jr., also played for the club.

This species has also been introduced to French Polynesia. It is commonly found in temperate forest and dry savannah habitats. It may also be found in dry forest and mangrove habitats in tropical region. The species is distinguished by the bright red stripe above the eye, and bright red rump. The rest of the body is grey, with olive wing coverts and collar. Juveniles do not have red brow marks, and lack olive colouration on the collar and wing coverts. The adults are 11‚Äì12 cm long. Taxonomy The red-browed finch was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Fringilla temporalis. It is one of four species in the genus Neochmia. Alternate names include red-browed firetail, Sydney waxbill and redbill. The species was once allied to genus Emblema. There are three noted subspecies: the nominate species N. temporalis temporalis, in most of the east coast, and inland New South Wales and Victoria; N. temporalis minor, which is distinguished by a white breast, in northern Queensland, and south-east of Australia, and N. temporalis loftyi in the south west corner of South Australia, although the latter is sometimes not listed as a subspecies, as the differences between it and the type species are relatively minor. Conservation status The finch is common in the south east of its range, from Brisbane to Melbourne. Subspecies N. t. minor is common between Cooktown and Townsville. The species is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List. There are no key threatening processes for N. temporalis, although the Pest Animal Control CRC suggests that the introduced nutmeg mannikin (Lonchura punctulata), which currently threatens some native mannikins through increased competition, may be a minor threat to N. lateralis in northern Queensland. In regional areas the species needs adequate shrub density to provide cover and foraging places. The species has been noted to decline or even disappear in areas that have been cleared or grazed, especially in combination with drought. Mating; male with display stalk Biology and ecology The red-browed finch is highly sociable, and is usually seen in small flocks of 10 to 20 individuals. Flocks are sedentary or nomadic in their local area. Flocks prefer semi-open woodland, especially edges of forests, where brushy scrub meets cleared areas, especially near creeks. The finch makes short, piping high-pitched cheeps. When disturbed, the whole flock will disperse, cheeping, and re-congregate near-by. N. temporalis is a seed eater, living mostly on grass and sedge seed, but will happily feed on many non-native seeds. Wild birds will even enter large-mesh aviaries in suburban areas to eat seed, given the opportunity. The red-browed finch builds a large domed nest with a side entrance, woven from grass and small twigs. Nests are usually built 2‚Äì3 metres above the ground in dense shrubs. Nesting is communal. Both parents share nest building, incubation of the eggs, and feed the young together. Four to six white eggs are laid per clutch two or three times per year, between October and April. Juveniles are fully independent within 28 days. Red-browed finches are common aviary birds. The red-browed finch will sometimes hybridise with the star finch, crimson finch, and zebra finch if kept together in captivity. The species has been introduced to southwest Australia, where it is sometimes confused with the red-eared firetail Stagonopleura oculata. Origin Origin and phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).

It constitutes the visible portions of the Cygnus Loop, a supernova remnant, many portions of which have acquired their own individual names and catalogue identifiers. The source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the Sun, and it exploded between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. The remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly 3 degrees in diameter (about 6 times the diameter, and 36 times the area, of the full Moon). While previous distance estimates have ranged from 1200 to 5800 light- years, a recent determination of 2400 light-years is based on direct astrometric measurements. (The distance estimates affect also the estimates of size and age.) The Hubble Space Telescope captured several images of the nebula. The analysis of the emissions from the nebula indicate the presence of oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen. The Cygnus Loop is also a strong emitter of radio waves and x-rays. On 24 September 2015 new images and videos of the Veil Nebula were released by the Space Telescope Science Institute, with an explanation of the images.  Components  In modern usage, the names Veil Nebula, Cirrus Nebula, and Filamentary Nebula generally refer to all the visible structure of the remnant, or even to the entire loop itself. The structure is so large that several NGC numbers were assigned to various arcs of the nebula. There are three main visual components: * The Western Veil (also known as Caldwell 34), consisting of NGC 6960 (the \\"Witch's Broom\\",Tom Trusock, \\"Small Wonders: Cygnus ...\\", [section] \\"The Veil\\", Cloudy Nights Telescope Reviews Lacework Nebula, \\"Filamentary Nebula\\") near the foreground star 52 Cygni; * The Eastern Veil (also known as Caldwell 33), whose brightest area is NGC 6992, trailing off farther south into NGC 6995 (together with NGC 6992 also known as \\"Network Nebula\\") and IC 1340; and * Pickering's Triangle (or Pickering's Triangular Wisp), brightest at the north central edge of the loop, but visible in photographs continuing toward the central area of the loop. NGC 6974 and NGC 6979 are luminous knots in a fainter patch of nebulosity on the northern rim between NGC 6992 and Pickering's Triangle.  Observation  A broad view of Cygnus loop/Veil nebula in ultraviolet The nebula was discovered on 5 September 1784 by William Herschel. He described the western end of the nebula as \\"Extended; passes thro' 52 Cygni... near 2 degree in length\\", and described the eastern end as \\"Branching nebulosity... The following part divides into several streams uniting again towards the south.\\" When finely resolved, some parts of the nebula appear to be rope-like filaments. The standard explanation is that the shock waves are so thin, less than one part in 50,000 of the radius, that the shell is visible only when viewed exactly edge-on, giving the shell the appearance of a filament. At the estimated distance of 2400 light-years, the nebula has a radius of 65 light- years (a diameter of 130 light-years). The thickness of each filament is 1/50,000th of the radius, or about 4 billion miles, roughly the distance from Earth to Pluto. Undulations in the surface of the shell lead to multiple filamentary images, which appear to be intertwined. A false-colour narrowband image made using amateur equipment Even though the nebula has a relatively bright integrated magnitude of 7, it is spread over so large an area that the surface brightness is quite low, so the nebula is notorious among astronomers as being difficult to see. However, an observer can see the nebula clearly in a telescope using an O-III astronomical filter isolating the wavelength of light from doubly ionized oxygen), as almost all light from this nebula is emitted at this wavelength. An telescope equipped with an O-III filter shows the delicate lacework apparent in photographs. Smaller telescopes with an O-III filter can show the nebula as well, and some argue that it can be seen without any optical aid except an O-III filter held up to the eye. The brighter segments of the nebula have the New General Catalogue designations NGC 6960, 6974, 6979, 6992, and 6995. The easiest segment to find is 6960, which runs behind 52 Cygni, a star that can be seen with the naked eye. NGC 6992/5 are objects on the eastern side of the loop which are also relatively easy to see. NGC 6974 and NGC 6979 are visible as knots in an area of nebulosity along the northern rim. Pickering's Triangle is much fainter, and has no NGC number (though 6979 is occasionally used to refer to it). It was discovered photographically in 1904 by Williamina Fleming (after the New General Catalogue was published), but credit went to Edward Charles Pickering, the director of her observatory, as was the custom of the day. The Veil Nebula is expanding at a velocity of about 1.5 million kilometers per hour. Using images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope between 1997 and 2015, the expansion of the Veil Nebula has been directly observed.  In fiction  :See Veil Nebula in fiction.

It has a seven speed manual transmission controlled by paddles on the steering wheel. Like the later Saab Turbo X, the Aero-X has four wheel drive. The doors and windscreen are connected, so instead of using conventional doors or even gullwing doors, it uses a cockpit canopy where the entire top section of the car is opened. This offers the Aero X's driver full 180 degree vision, and also facilitates entry and exit from its low slung cabin. The body is made of carbon fiber. The suspension is electronically controlled. Even though it is a two seat sports car, it has reasonable storage, as the rear features two storage facilities, with a conventional hatchback and sliding drawer underneath. The interior offers \\"clean Scandinavian interior design\\". The car has no ordinary dials and buttons; instead, data is displayed on acrylic 'clear zones' in graphic 3D images. All interior and exterior lights utilize LEDs. Although only a concept car, it has been well received, with many fans calling for its production. Victor Muller responded on the SaabsUnited.com website, saying that it is not a priority for the company right now. \\"This study shows how the strength of the Saab brand heritage can inspire bold, innovative design\\", said Bryan Nesbitt, the Executive Director of GM Design Europe: \\"As we move forward with new Saab product, we will remain focused on carefully cultivating this brand equity in the context of Scandinavian design values\\". \\"This concept shows the exciting possibilities that are open to us as we evolve a more progressive design language for the Saab brand\\", said Jan √Öke Jonsson, Saab's Managing Director. \\"Our designers, engineers and marketers in Sweden are ideally placed to nurture and communicate the unique DNA of the Saab brand.

Double stranded adapters can be synthesized to have blunt ends to both terminals or to have sticky end at one end and blunt end at the other. For instance, a double stranded DNA adapter can be used to link the ends of two other DNA molecules (i.e., ends that do not have \\"sticky ends\\", that is complementary protruding single strands by themselves). It may be used to add sticky ends to cDNA allowing it to be ligated into the plasmid much more efficiently. Two adapters could base pair to each other to form dimers. A conversion adapter is used to join a DNA insert cut with one restriction enzyme, say EcoRl, with a vector opened with another enzyme, Bam Hl. This adapter can be used to convert the cohesive end produced by Bam Hl to one produced by Eco Rl or vice versa. One of its applications is ligating cDNA into a plasmid or other vectors instead of using Terminal deoxynucleotide Transferase enzyme to add poly A to the cDNA fragment.Singh, B.D (2003).

It marked the studio return of bassist Trevor Bolder, who had rejoined the band for the Head First tour. The band also had a new record label, Portrait Records, a subsidiary of CBS. Equator was also the last Uriah Heep album to feature vocalist Peter Goalby & keyboardist John Sinclair. The tour programme would be Heep's last in the UK until the Wake the Sleeper tour, which began in 2008. When the Heep back catalogue was issued on CD in the early 1990s by Castle and then remastered, with bonus tracks, in the mid-to- late 1990s by Essential, Equator was conspicuous by its absence. This was because Sony/CBS wanted what was considered an extortionate sum for the rights. The album ultimately had a CD release in 1999, with no bonus material whatsoever. When the Essential remasters were expanded and reissued in the early 2000s by Sanctuary, Equator had to be passed over once again. However, in 2010, the album finally saw a release in expanded and remastered format, in time for its 25th Anniversary, thus finally ending Sanctuary's remaster- series.

It is a native of eastern and southern Australia. Populations in New Guinea and northern Australia, which were at one time considered to be a subspecies, are now accepted as a separate species, the paperbark flycatcher (Myiagra nana). It is a small to medium-sized bird and has similar colouring to the willie wagtail. Taxonomy and systematics Photographed at Dayboro, SE Queensland, Australia Also known colloquially as razor grinder, scissors grinder, dishlicker or dishwasher on account of its unusual call, the restless flycatcher was first described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Turdus inquietus. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin inquietus 'restless'. Populations from northern Australia and New Guinea, formerly considered a distinctive subspecies, are now separated as the paperbark flycatcher (Myiagra nana), with which it forms a superspecies.  Description  It is about long, with a glossy dark blue crest, a grey-blue back and white underparts. It is similar to the willie wagtail, though the lack of a black throat, crest on head, white eyebrow and slenderer body shape are distinguishing features.  Distribution and Habitat  The Restless Flycatcher is found throughout east, south-east and south-west Australia and Papua New Guinea. From Cairns in Far North Queensland into west of Central Queensland and most of New South Wales, Victoria, southern South Australia and south-west of Western Australia. During winter many south and south-eastern populations move further north. Its habitat is usually open and wooded forests, in river red gums near water, inland and coastal scrubs and some semi-urban environments.  Conservation  Despite being described as of least concern by the IUCN, their population is decreasing. The exact number of individuals is unknown.https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/103711768/112352391  Behaviour and ecology = Breeding  The restless flycatcher builds a cup-shaped nest from shredded bark and grasses, matted and bound with spider- webbing. Linings used are soft bark, grasses, hair or feathers. It is often decorated with lichen, strips of bark or spiders' egg sacs. The nest site is in the fork of a well-foliaged tree mostly near or overhanging water, though it can be up to twenty or more metres above the ground. They will lay three, light-grey to white glossy eggs with brown or dark spots at the larger end.  Food and feeding  The restless flycatcher feeds on insects, as well as other invertebrates such as spiders and centipedes and will feed alone or in pairs. It often hovers with its head and tail pointed downwards as it picks insects off from leaves, and it rarely goes to the ground, preferring to hunt insects from mid-canopy.

Collingwood Football Club snared Wayne Richardson from South Fremantle Football Club in 1965 before he had made his senior debut and, not surprisingly, the West Australian side was extremely reluctant to clear him. Richardson was forced to stand out of football for the entire 1965 season before his clearance was ratified, but as far as the Magpies were concerned, it was worth the wait, as he would develop into one of the finest players in the club's history. A tough customer, and extremely skilful, he spent most of his 277-game, 323 goal VFL career between 1966 and 1978 as either a rover or ruck-rover, where his adeptness at reading the play enabled him to pick up countless possessions. A Copeland Trophy winner in 1971 and 1974, Richardson captained the Magpies from midway through the 1971 season until 1975. He represented the VFL on five occasions, and was universally acknowledged as one of the 'greats' of his era, a status emphasised by his inclusion in Collingwood's official 'Team of the Twentieth Century'. Wayne's brother Max Richardson, played 211 games for Collingwood from 1969‚Äì1978, and another 30 for Fitzroy Football Club in 1979‚Äì1980.

Geography The Yilo Krobo district is approximately between latitude 60 .00‚ÄôN and 00 .30‚ÄôN and between longitude 00 . 30‚Äô and 10 .00‚ÄôW. It covers an estimated area of 805sq.km, constituting 4.2 percent of the total area of the Eastern Region with Somanya as its capital. The Yilo Krobo district is bounded in the north and east by Lower Manya Krobo District, in the South by Akuapim North District and on the West by New-Juaben Municipal District, East Akim Municipal District and Fanteakwa District. The municipality has about two hundred and thirty settlements out of which only the municipal capital, Somanya and Nkurakan have populations of above 5,000. The municipality is divided into seven Zonal Councils namely, Somanya, Oterkpolu, Boti, Nkurakan, Nsutapong, Klo-Agogo and Obawale Climate The Yilo Krobo Municipality lies within the dry equatorial climatic zone which experiences substantial amount of precipitation. This is characterized by a bi- modal rainy season, which reaches its maximum during the two peak periods of May ‚Äì June and September ‚Äì October. The annual rainfall is between 750mm in the southeast and 1600mm on the slopes of the ranges in the northwest. Temperature ranges between a minimum of 24.90 C and a maximum of 29.90 C. A relative humidity of 60 ‚Äì 93 percent is a characteristic of the municipality. Vegetation The municipality lies within the semi-deciduous rain forest and the coastal savannah zone of the country. There is the dry semi-deciduous (fire zone) which stretches from the municipality to the lower part of the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality covering 855 square kilometres. Tree types that are most widespread in the municipality include palm, mango, nim, ceiba and acassia. The coastal savannah zone in the south-eastern part forms part of the Accra plains. Topography and Drainage. The area is predominantly mountainous. The Akwapim Ranges stretch into the municipality from southwest to northeast across the municipality. With its accompanying deep valleys, it provides an undulating landscape. The low lands are in the south-eastern part of the municipality. The rocks forming the ranges are called the Togo series, which include quartzites, phyllites, sandstones, phyllonites and sandy-shades. The quartzites in the municipality are hard, massively bedded rocks but occasionally flaky varieties occur. They are fine to median grained sand but grayish when fresh. On the average, the height of the highlands in the municipality ranges between 300 and 500 metres above sea level. There is a scarp rising up to 600 metres, which forms the boundary with the New Juaben Municipality. On the south-eastern part of the municipality is the Krobo Mountains from where it is believed the Yilo people migrated to the present area Population Size and Distribution (Urban/Rural) According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC) report, Yilo Krobo has a total population of 87,847 which comprises 42,378 males (48.2%) and 45,469 females (54.8%); depicting more females than males. This represents 3.3 percent of the regional population. With a growth rate (crude) of about 1.25%, the municipality‚Äôs population stood at 91,183 as at the end of 2013. About 30.92 percent of the population lives in urban centres whilst 69.8 percent lives in rural areas. This might be because the municipality is more rural than urban. For all groups of ages, most people are living in the rural areas as compared to the urban areas. This could be due to the fact that the main occupation in the municipality is farming. The municipality must therefore fashion out strategies to development the agricultural sector and growth of other settlements. Table 1.8 shows the population size by locality of residence, the sex ratio and the percentage the municipality covers in the region. Sex ratio is the ratio of males to females in a given population, usually expressed as the number of males per 100 females. The sex ratio for Yilo Krobo Municipality is 93.20 meaning there are about 93 males, for every 100 females. Migration The total number of migrants in Yilo Krobo municipality was 27,474 (2010 PHC). Out of this, about 69 percent which is equivalent to 19,045 persons were born in the same region but leaving elsewhere other than their place of birth in that same region (intra- regional migration). The Volta, Greater Accra and Ashanti regions are relatively large in-migrant areas in the municipality, ie, 2,429, 1,931 and 1,188 persons respectively. The Greater Accra and Volta regions are very close to the municipality and this might explain why people easily move from those regions to the municipality to trade. The least in-migrant areas are Upper East and Upper West regions ie 77 and 57 persons respectively. This might also be due to the fact that these regions are the farthest from the municipality so very few migrants move from those places to the municipality to trade. Those who migrate might do so because of marriage since Upper East had the highest percentage (29.9) of persons who have stayed in the municipality for twenty years and above. Household Size The total number of households in the Yilo Krobo Municipality is 20,613. Out of this, 13,145 households are headed by males and the remaining 7, 468 by females. As the number of household size increases, the number of persons constituting such households decreases. Few persons have household sizes of 8 and above. The average household size for the Yilo Krobo municipality is 4.2. This means that on the average each household in the municipality is made up of 4 persons. It is interesting to note that the average household size of male headed households is about 3 (3.2) while that of the female is 6.0 which is almost twice that of the males. This might be due to the fact that most of the time when females head a household; they bring their relatives and family friends to stay with them. This in turn increases the number of persons living in the household References 2.http://easternregion.gov.gh/index.php/yilo-krobo/ Sources * * GhanaDistricts.com Category:Districts of the Eastern Region (Ghana) ","title":"Yilo Krobo District"},{"id":"4149596","text":"The Zabzugu-Tatale District is one of the twenty (20) districts in the Northern Region of north Ghana.Zabzugu-Tatale district The capital is Zabzugu.

He is best known as the lead vocalist for Welsh band Lone Star during 1977/'78 and classic rockers Uriah Heep from 1979 to 1981. Biography Sloman's first band of note was local Cardiff fave Trapper before he joined Lone Star in time for their 1977 sophomore album, Firing on All Six, supported by a Reading Festival appearance on August 26, 1977, a headline tour, and another tour with Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush later that same year. Lone Star disbanded before a third album could be completed as guitarist Paul Chapman left to take Michael Schenker's spot in UFO. Four songs from a BBC broadcast with Sloman, recorded September 29, 1977 at Queen Mary College, were released in 1994 as part of BBC Radio One Live In Concert. Sloman and Lone Star drummer Dixie Lee, along with Trapper bassist Pino Paladino, would join forces in Canadian outfit Pulsar with keyboardist Gregg Dechert and former Ian Thomas Band guitarist Dave Cooper. It would prove to be a short lived union as Sloman got the call from the Uriah Heep camp in 1979 to take over for John Lawton. Sloman recorded the controversial Conquest album with the group but departed in 1981, citing \\"musical differences.\\" An uncredited Sloman also played keyboards on UFO's 1981 album The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent. After Uriah Heep, he formed the band John Sloman's Badlands and showcased at the Marquee Club but failed to procure a record deal. Badlands featured former Trapper drummer John Munro, Whitesnake's Neil Murray on bass, Graeme Pleeth on keyboards and guitarist John Sykes prior to his joining Thin Lizzy (and later reuniting with Murray in Whitesnake). Sloman and Murray would both join Gary Moore's band which resulted in the Rockin' Every Night: Live in Japan album. Sloman went on to record the first of his solo albums, the Todd Rundgren produced Disappearances Can Be Deceptive, released in 1989. It featured contributions from former Trapper and Pulsar bandmates Pino Paladino, John Munro, and Gregg Dechert (who had also spent time with Sloman in Uriah Heep), as well as noted session guitarist Alan Murphy. Sloman worked on various projects throughout the 1990s, including Souls Unknown with old mates Paladino (who would later serve for a number of years as touring bassist for The Who) and Munro and The Who/Atomic Rooster affiliated guitarist Steve 'Boltz' Bolton. Another project involved Paladino, guitarist Mats Johansson, and drummer Theodore Thunder (Dick Heckstall-Smith, Leo Sayer). Sloman would take on the pseudonym Earl Grangetown for The Beat Poets, a venture into soul music, which also featured former Lone Star bandmate Pete Hurley on bass. Although an album was recorded, it was never released. Sloman has gone on to produce three more solo albums since the turn of the millennium, Dark Matter (2003) and 13 Storeys (2006), an acoustic affair on which he is credited with playing everything from cello to harmonium, and his latest effort, Reclamation (2010). Toto guitarist Steve Lukather recorded a cover of Sloman's \\"Jammin' with Jesus\\" off Dark Matter on his 2008 solo album Ever Changing Times. Lukather had originally cut the song with Jeff Beck years earlier but Beck never put it out. Sloman guested with NWOBHM veterans Praying Mantis on 2003's The Journey Goes On, providing lead vocals on 3 songs, \\"Tonight\\", \\"Beast Within\\" and \\"The Voice.\\" He is also credited on the 2007 soundtrack for Highlander: The Source as the vocalist performing the Queen hits \\"Princes of the Universe\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" as well as \\"The Sun Is Gonna Shine\\", a duet with Tamasin Hardy.

Birth and family Arthur was born December 26, 1888 in Waycross, Georgia, the son of John Spencer and Emma Victoria (n√©e Cason) Moore. Arthur was of Irish ancestry. His great grandfather came to North Carolina and his grandfather moved to Georgia. Arthur's grandfather later died in the Battle of Gaines' Mill in 1862. Arthur married Martha \\"Mattie\\" T. McDonald April 26, 1906. They had children William Harry, Wilbur Wardlaw, Alice Evelyn Means, Arthur James Jr., and Dorothy Emma. Mattie died in 1964. Education and conversion to Christ Arthur Sr studied at Emory College in Oxford, Georgia from 1909 until 1911. He did not complete an earned degree. Instead, he was converted to Christ in his twenty-first year and began to preach at once! He subsequently was awarded several honorary degrees, including the degree of D.D. from Asbury College, Wilmore, Kentucky (1922), Central College, Fayette, Missouri (1924), and Emory University (1934); and the degree of LL.D. from Southwestern University, Georgetown, Texas (1935), Randolph-Macon College (1939), Florida Southern College (1942), and Mercer University (1968). Ordained ministry Arthur experienced a \\"drastic\\" conversion to Christ in his twenty-first year and began to preach at once. He joined the South Georgia Annual Conference in 1909. He served various churches as Pastor during 1909-20. He also served as a roving evangelist, and was a most eloquent speaker. In 1920, the Rev. Moore was appointed to the Travis Park Methodist Church in San Antonio, Texas, serving there until 1926. He then was appointed Pastor of First Methodist Church, Birmingham, Alabama. Honors The Rev. Moore was honored by Asbury College with the degree Doctor of Divinity in 1922. Central College did the same in 1924, as did Emory University (D.D., 1934). Asbury College also awarded the LL.D. in 1930. Southwestern University did the same in 1935, Randolph-Macon College in 1939, and Florida Southern College in 1941. He also received an honorary degree from Wesleyan College. The Rev. Moore was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was a 32¬∞ Mason and a Knights Templar. Episcopal ministry The Rev. Dr. Arthur James Moore was elected and consecrated to the Episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South at the 1930 General Conference of that denomination. Bishop Moore was assigned responsibility for all missionary activities of the MECS in China, Japan, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Belgian Congo, Poland and Korea, until 1940. In 1940 he was assigned the Atlanta episcopal area of the (newly reunited) Methodist Church. His address was 63 Auburn Ave., N.E., Atlanta. Bishop Moore also served as President of Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia in 1941, and as Chairman of the Board. He was a member of the Committee on Interdenominational Relations and Church Union of the MECS (1934‚Äì39), and President of the Board of Missions and Church Extension of The Methodist Church. He was also the organizer and first President of the Board of Evangelism of The Methodist Church. Bishop Moore died June 30, 1974.

It is one of several species known as friarbirds whose heads are bare of feathers. It is brown-grey in colour, with a prominent knob on its bare black-skinned head. It feeds on insects and nectar. Taxonomy The noisy friarbird was first described by ornithologist John Latham in 1790. The generic name is from the Ancient Greek philƒìm≈çn 'affectionate, kissing'. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin corniculum '(having a) little horn'. It is sometimes known as a leatherhead. Wirgan was a name used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. Molecular study shows its closest relative to be the silver-crowned friarbird within the genus Philemon. DNA analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Description Head Measuring in length, the noisy friarbird is a large honeyeater with dull brownish grey upperparts and paler brown-grey underparts. Its black head is completely bald apart from tufts of feathers under the chin and along the eyebrow, which is how it came to be so named. It can be distinguished by its rounded knob above the black bill, which is visible at distance. It has dark blue-black legs and red eyes. As its name suggests, it is noisy; one of its calls has been likened to \\"four o'clock\\". Distribution and habitat The natural range is from the vicinity of Lakes Entrance and the Murray valley in Victoria, north through New South Wales and Queensland to Cape York. In New Guinea, it is restricted to the Trans-Fly in the south of the island where it is locally abundant. Behaviour In southern parts of eastern Australia the species is migratory, moving north to overwinter and returning south in the spring. Large aggregations of noisy friarbirds are possible, often in association with little friarbirds. At such times, the constant cackling and chattering of the noisy friarbird can fill the forest with sound. The calls are used to identify an individual's feeding territory, and also announce the presence of food sources worth defending to other birds‚Äînot necessarily friarbirds alone. Their diet consists of nectar, insects, and fruit. The consumption of commercially grown fruit, such as grapes and berries, can bring noisy friarbirds into direct conflict with humans who may regard them as pests under those circumstances. They are aggressively protective of their nests, and are known to swoop. Breeding Breeding may occur from July to January, with one or two broods during this time. The nest is a large, deep cup with an inverted lip or rim, made of bark and grass hanging from a horizontal branch, 1‚Äì3 metres above the ground, and usually well-hidden. Two to four (rarely five) eggs are laid, measuring , and buff- to pale-pink splotched with darker pink-brown or purplish colours.

It was an independent parish until 1897 and has a documented history dating back to the 9th century. Southchurch Hall Holy Trinity Church, Southchurch History In 824 AD, a Saxon thegn, Leofstan presented the manor of Southchurch to the monks of Canterbury. It is possible that the church from which the manor takes its name already existed beforehand. The name \\"Southchurch\\" originates from a Saxon church which was south of a pre-Norman minster. Location Southchurch is bounded by Southchurch Avenue to the west (beyond which is central Southend-on-Sea), Thorpe Hall Boulevard to the east (beyond which is Thorpe Bay), Southchurch Road and Southchurch Boulevard to the north (beyond which is Bournes Green) and Eastern Esplanade to the south (which runs along the north bank of the River Thames). Principal roads include Southchurch Road, Southchurch Boulevard, Woodgrange Drive, Ambleside Drive, Wyatts Drive and Lifstan Way. Housing The current local housing stock mainly dates from the first half of the twentieth century, when Southchurch expanded from a village into the residential district of Southend. To the south of the station is Southchurch Hall, a thirteenth-century moated manor house. This is now open to the public as a museum, which stands in a small park: Southchurch Hall Gardens. Schools Futures College, Southend High School for Girls (grammar), Greenways primary school, Hamstel Road primary school and Porters Grange primary school are situated within the boundaries of Southchurch. Churches Holy Trinity Church is the original parish church of Southchurch. The oldest parts of this church date back to the Saxon era, with later additions in the early 20th century.http://www.holytrinitysouthchurch.org/#!history/c6nk Christ Church (Church of England) is in Colbert Avenue, just to the east of Southchurch Park East. This parish was carved out of Holy Trinity in 1922. It began as a mission church in Elizabeth Road, which runs from the seafront to Southchurch Park. Rail Southchurch is served by Southend East railway station. In 2004, following a campaign by local residents, traders, and some local councillors, the station signs were amended to read \\"Southend East for Southchurch Village\\". Sports Southchurch is home to Southend Sunday Division team Bellevue Wanderers Football Club, Essex Senior Football League team Southend Manor and Southend Sceptre League team Southchurch AFC.

It has a semicircular ear-patch, pale yellow in colour. The name of this bird commemorates the Australian artist John Lewin. Description Tweed Valley, New South Wales The Lewin's honeyeater is small to medium in size . It is dark greenish-grey in colour, with a creamy yellow gape (i.e., the fleshy corners of the mouth). It has large, yellowish, crescent-shaped ear-patches, which distinguish it from other honeyeaters, apart from two similar, but smaller, species in tropical Queensland. In flight, the pale yellow edges of the flight feathers can be seen. The bill is black and the eye is blue-grey. Both sexes are similar in appearance. Young Lewin's honeyeaters are similar to the adults, but have brown eyes. The strong 'machine gun-like' rattling notes of Lewin's honeyeater are heard over long distances, and reveal its presence in an area. Body size, voice, and the shape and size of the ear-patch help in identifying the similar Graceful and Yellow-spotted Honeyeaters in tropical Queensland. Distribution and habitat Dayboro, SE Queensland, Australia The Lewin's honeyeater prefers the wetter parts of eastern Australia, from northern Queensland to central Victoria. It is found in both rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest, and often wanders into more open woodland. It is a common bird, and its call is often heard in these areas. It is a rather sedentary species, tending to stay in the same area all year round, although some altitudinal migration, to lower elevations in the cooler winter months, occurs. Diet Feeding on the nectar of a Grevillea flower Lewin's honeyeaters feed mostly on fruits, favouring berries and small fruits, but also eat insects and nectar. Birds are normally seen alone, but may form loose groups of up to 10 birds. They feed in the upper branches and on the trunks of trees. Some insects are caught in flight. Breeding Lewin's honeyeaters breed during September to January. The nest is a large cup of vegetation and other materials, bound together with spider web, and lined with soft material. The two to three oval eggs are incubated for about 14 days, and the young birds leave the nest after a further 14 days. It is unclear what roles each parent performs in nest building and incubation, but both care for the young birds. References * Longmore, N.W. 1991. The Honeyeaters & their Allies of Australia.

The Human Zoo, a follow-up book by Morris that examined the behaviour of people in cities, was published in 1969. Summary The Naked Ape, which was serialised in the Daily Mirror newspaper and has been translated into 23 languages, depicts human behaviour as largely evolved to meet the challenges of prehistoric life as a hunter . The book was so named because out of 193 species of monkeys and apes, only humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) are not covered in hair. Desmond Morris, the author, who had been the curator of mammals at London Zoo, said his book was intended to popularise and demystify science.BBC On This Day  12  1967: The Naked Ape steps out Morris said that Homo sapiens not only have the largest brains of all higher primates, but that sexual selection in human evolution has caused humans to have the highest ratio of penis size to body mass. Morris conjectured that human ear-lobes developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding. Morris further stated that the more rounded shape of human female breasts means they are mainly a sexual signalling device rather than simply for providing milk for infants. Morris framed many features of human behaviour in the context of evolution at a time when cultural explanations were more orthodox. For example, Morris wrote that the intense human pair bond evolved so that men who were out hunting could trust that their mates back home were not having sex with other men, and suggested the possibility that sparse body hair evolved because the \\"nakedness\\" helped intensify pair bonding by increasing tactile pleasure.Wright, Robert.

Film adaptations A 1973 film directed by Donald Driver, very loosely based on the book, was made starring Johnny Crawford and Victoria Principal. In 2006, an independent film was made, based loosely on the book, written and directed by Daniel Mellitz, starring Josh Wise, Chelse Swain, Sean Shanks, Amanda MacDonald, Tony LaThanh, Corbin Bernsen.

It was activated in 1968 and disbanded in 1980. Its predecessor, Air Defense Command, was established in 1946, briefly inactivated in 1950, reactivated in 1951, and then redesignated Aerospace rather than Air in 1968. Its mission was to provide air defense of the Continental United States (CONUS). It directly controlled all active measures, and was tasked to coordinate all passive means of air defense. Air defense during World War II Continental United States air defense forces during World War II were initially under the command of the four air districts ‚Äì Northeast Air District, Northwest Air District, Southeast Air District, and Southwest Air District. The air districts were established on 16 January 1941 before the Pearl Harbor attack. The four air districts also handled USAAF combat training with the Army Ground Forces and \\"organization and training of bomber, fighter and other units and crews for assignments overseas\\". The air districts were redesignated on 26 March 1941 as the 1st Air Force, 2nd Air Force, 3rd Air Force, & 4th Air Force, First and Fourth Air Forces, through their interceptor commands, managed the civilian Aircraft Warning Service on the West and East Coasts. The USAAF's Aircraft Warning Corps provided air defense warning with information centers that networked an area's \\"Army Radar Stations\\" which communicated radar tracks by telephone. The AWC information centers also integrated visual reports processed by Ground Observer Corps filter centers.

Air Defense Command 1946 Shield of Air Defense Command Air Defense Command was activated on 21 March 1946 with the former CAF Fourth Air Force, the tbd's Tenth Air Force, and the tbd's Fourteenth Air Force (Second Air Force was reactivated and added on 6 June.) In December 1946 \\"Development of Radar Equipment for Detecting and Countering Missiles of the German A-4 type\\" was planned (cited by Schaffel, p. 314) (part of Signal Corps' Project 414A contracted to Bell Laboratories in 1945). The Distant Early Warning Line was \\"first conceived‚Äîand rejected‚Äîin 1946\\". A 1947 proposal for 411 radar stations and 18 control centers costing $600 million was the Project Supremacy plan for a postwar Radar Fence that was rejected by Air Defense Command since \\"no provision was made in it for the Alaska to Greenland net with flanks guarded by aircraft and picket ships [required] for 3 to 6 hours of warning time\\", and \\"Congress failed to act on legislation required to support the proposed system\\". (In the spring and summer of 1947, 3 ADC AC&W; plans had gone unfunded.) By 1948 there were only 5 AC&W; stations, including the Twin Lights station in NJ that opened in June and Montauk NY \\"Air Warning Station #3 (5 July)\\\\--cf. SAC radar stations, e.g., at Dallas & Denver Bomb Plots. ADC became a subordinate operational command of Continental Air Command on 1 December 1948 and on 27 June 1950, United States air defense systems began 24-hour operations two days after the start of the Korean War. By the time ADC was inactivated on 1 July 1950, ADC had deployed the Lashup Radar Network with existing radars at 43 sites. In addition, 36 Air National Guard fighter units were called to active duty for the mission. Reformation 1951 ADC was reinstated as a major command on 1 January 1951 at Mitchel Air Force Base, New York. The headquarters was moved to Ent Air Force Base in Colorado Springs on 8 January 1951. It received 21 former ConAC active-duty fighter squadrons (37 additional Air National Guard fighter squadrons if called to active duty). ADC was also assigned the 25th, 26th 27th and 28th Air Divisions (Defense) ADC completed the Priority Permanent System network for Aircraft Warning and Control (ground-controlled interception) in 1952. Gaps were filled by additional Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar stations and the Ground Observation Corps (disbanded 1959). In May 1954, ADC moved their 1951 command center from a former hallway/latrine area of the Ent AFB headquarters building into a \\"much improved 15,000-square-foot concrete block\\" building with \\"main battle control center\\". During the mid-1950s, planners devised the idea of extending the wall of powerful land-based radar seaward with Airborne early warning and control units. This was done by equipping two wings of Lockheed RC-121 Warning Star aircraft, the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and the 552nd AEWCW, based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, one wing stationed on each coast. The RC-121s, EC-121s and Texas Towers, it was believed, would contribute to extending contiguous east-coast radar coverage some 300 to 500 miles seaward. In terms of the air threat of the 1950s, this meant a gain of at least 30 extra minutes warning time of an oncoming bomber attack.Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star ADC's Operation Tail Wind on 11‚Äì12 July tested its augmentation plan that required Air Training Command interceptors participate in an air defense emergency. A total of seven ATC bases actively participated in the exercise, deploying aircraft and aircrews and supporting the ADC radar net. As the USAF prepared to deploy the Tactical Air Command E-3 Sentry in the later 1970s, active-duty units were phased out EC-121 operations by the end of 1975. All remaining EC-121s were transferred to the Air Force Reserve, which formed the 79th AEWCS at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in early 1976. The active duty force continued to provide personnel to operate the EC-121s on a 24-hour basis, assigning Detachment 1, 20th Air Defense Squadron to Homestead AFB as associate active duty crews to fly the Reserve-owned aircraft. Besides monitoring Cuban waters, these last Warning Stars also operated from NAS Keflavik, Iceland. Final EC-121 operations ended in September 1978. Air and Aerospace Defense Command Convair F-106A Delta Dart of ADC's 5th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron near Mount Rushmore (lower right background) The United States Army Air Forces activated Air Defense Command (ADC) in 1946, with a Numbered Air Force of the former Continental Air Forces, from which it took its mission of air warning and air defense. In September 1947, it became part of the newly established United States Air Force. The command become a subordinate organization of Continental Air Command (ConAC) on 1 December 1948. ConAC gradually assumed direct charge of ADC air defense components, and ADC inactivated on 1 July 1950. But five months later, on 10 November 1950, Generals Vandenberg and Twining notified General Whitehead that \\"the Air Force had approved activation of a separate Air Defense Command [from CONAC] with headquarters on Ent\\" with the mission to stop a handful of conventionally armed piston engine-powered bombers on a one-way mission. The command was formally reactivated on 1 January 1951. With advances in Soviet bombers, ADC completed improved radar networks and manned interceptors in the 1950s. At the end of the decade it computerized Air Defense Direction Centers to allow air defense controllers to more quickly review integrated military air defense warning (MADW) data and dispatch defenses (e.g., surface-to-air missiles in 1959). ADC began missile warning and space surveillance missions in 1960 and 1961, and established a temporary missile warning network for the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1968 it was redesignated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM). In 1975, ADCOM became a specified command and the United States' executive agent in the North American Air Defense Command‚Äîthe single CINCNORAD/CINCAD commanded both. ADCOM's last surface-to-air missiles were taken off alert in 1972, and the Federal Aviation Administration took over many of ADCOM's SAGE radar stations. Tactical Air Command and ADTAC On 1 October 1979 ADCOM interceptors/bases and remaining air warning radar stations transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC), with these \\"atmospheric\\" units assigned to Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). ADCOM's missile warning and space surveillance installations transferred in 1979 to the Strategic Air Command's Directorate of Space and Missile Warning Systems (SAC/SX),) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Air Force Element, NORAD/ADCOM (AFENA), which was redesignated the Aerospace Defense Center. The command was inactivated on 31 March 1980. With the disestablishment of TAC and SAC in 1992, the Aerospace Defense Center, the ADCOM specified command organizations, along with SAC's missile warning and space surveillance installations. became part of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). Air Force Space Command activated its headquarters in the same Chidlaw Building where ADCOM had been inactivated.

Interceptor Aircraft ADC had four day-type fighter squadrons (FDS) in 1946. The ADC interceptor force grew to ninety-three (93) active Air Force fighter interceptor squadrons, seventy-six (76) Air National Guard fighter interceptor squadrons, several U.S. Navy fighter squadrons, USAF and USN airborne early warning squadrons, radar squadrons, training squadrons, and numerous support units that have played important roles in our nation's defense. The first ADC interceptor, the P-61 Black Widow, did not have the capabilities to engage the Soviet Tu-4 bomber. Its successor, the F-82 Twin Mustang, was even more disappointing. It took a long time to get into production and did not perform well in inclement weather. Baugher ‚Äì Northrop P-61 Black WidowBaugher ‚Äì North American P/F-82 Twin Mustang The early jet fighters, such as the F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet, lacked all- weather capability and were deemed useless for air defense purposes. Much hope was placed on two jet-powered interceptors, the XP-87 Blackhawk and the XP-89 Scorpion. (Designations changed to XF-87 and XF-89.) They, in turn, also proved to be inadequate: the XF-87 was cancelled and the Scorpion underwent extensive redesign.Curtiss XP-87/XF-87 Blackhawk Baugher ‚Äì Curtiss XP-87/XF-87 BlackhawkBaugher ‚Äì Northrop F-89 Scorpion The first-generation jets gave way to all-weather dedicated interceptor jets. The F-94 Starfire was pressed into service as an \\"interim\\" interceptor, and North American in 1949 pushed an interceptor version of the Sabre, the F-86D. Despite the demands its complexity made upon a single pilot, the F-86D was backed by senior Air Force officials. Some 2,504 would be built and it would in time be the most numerous interceptor in the Air Defense Command fleet, with more than 1,000 in service by the end of 1955Baugher ‚Äì North American F-86D Sabre The F-86D was not ideal, however; its afterburner consumed a great deal of fuel in getting it to altitude, and the pilot was overburdened by cockpit tasks. The F-89D was modified to accept AIM-4 Falcon guided missiles (F-89H) and AIR-2 Genie atomic warhead rockets (F-89J) as armament. The F-86D was modified (F-86L) to include an FDDL SAGE data link that permitted automatic ground control. The F-86L and F-89H became available in 1956, and the F-89J in 1957. The first of the Century Series supersonic interceptors was the F-102A Delta Dagger in 1956, followed by the F-104A Starfighter in 1958. The F-101B Voodoo and F-106 Delta Dart were first received by ADC during the first half of 1959. By 1960, the ADC interceptor force was composed of the F-101, F-104, F-106, and the F-102.USAF Aerospace Defense Command publication, The Interceptor, January 1979 (Volume 21, Number 1). Artist's impression of the North American XF-108 Rapier The North American F-108 Rapier was the first proposed successor to the F-106. It was to be capable of Mach 3 performance and was intended to serve as a long-range interceptor that could destroy attacking Soviet bombers over the poles before they could get near US territory. It was also to serve as the escort fighter for the XB-70 Valkyrie Mach-3 strategic bomber, also to be built by North American. The Air Force expected that the first F-108A would be ready for service by early 1963. An order for no less than 480 F-108s was anticipated. However, by mid-1959, the Air Force was already beginning to experience some doubts about the high cost of the Rapier program. The primary strategic threat from the Soviet Union was now perceived to be its battery of intercontinental ballistic missiles instead of its force of long-range bombers. Against intercontinental ballistic missiles, the F-108A interceptor would be completely useless. In addition, the Air Force was increasingly of the opinion that unmanned intercontinental ballistic missiles could accomplish the mission of the B-70 Valkyrie/F-108 Rapier combination much more effectively and at far lower cost. Consequently, the F-108A project was cancelled in its entirety on 23 September 1959, before any prototypes could be built. Edwards testing by AFSC's 4786th TS. Using the AN/ASG-18 from the F-108 Rapier program and Falcon missile developed for the F-108A, the Mach 3 interceptor was funded by Congress with $90 million for a 14 May 1965 USAF order of 93 F-12B aircraft (cancelled by SECDEF). In 1968, ADCOM began the phaseout of the F-101 and F-102 interceptors from active duty units, with both types mostly being transferred to the Air National Guard. The F-101 would remain in a limited role on active duty until 1982, serving in such roles as towed target carrier aircraft and simulated enemy radar contacts for Airborne Weapons Controller students training for duties aboard the E-3 Sentry AWACS. The F-102 would see service until the mid-1980s as the PQM-102 aerial target drone. The F-106 Delta Dart, considered by many the finest all-weather interceptor ever built, was the primary air defense interceptor aircraft for the US Air Force during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was also the last dedicated interceptor in U.S. Air Force service to date. It was gradually retired during the 1980s, though the QF-106 drone conversions of the aircraft were used until 1998 as aerial targets under the FSAT program. =Interceptor gunnery training= B-57E, AF Ser. No. 55-4277, a target towing aircraft of the 8th Bomb Squadron at Yokota AB, Japan in 1958. Note the bright orange paint on the upper fuselage and wings B-57E Canberra dedicated Air Defense Command target towing aircraft were used for training of F-86D Sabre, F-94C Starfire, and F-89D Scorpion interceptors firing 2.75-inch Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding- Fin Aerial Rockets. Due to the nature of air-to-air weapon training requiring a large amount of air space, only a few locations were available for practice ranges. ADC assigned these aircraft to bases close to these large, restricted areas, and fighter-interceptor squadrons deployed to these bases for this type of \\"hot fire\\" training which took place in these ranges. The gunnery schools were located at Yuma AFB, Arizona (17th TTS), and later moved to MacDill AFB, Florida where the training continued over the Gulf of Mexico. With the move to Florida, the 3d TTS was formed at George AFB, California which performed training over the Mojave Desert in Southern California. Additional units were located at Biggs AFB, near El Paso, Texas (1st TTS) and the 4756th TTS was located at Tyndall AFB, Florida to support the Fighter Weapons Center located there. ADC also supported overseas training at Johnson AB, Japan (6th TTS). From Johnson AB, B-57Es deployed to Clark AB, Philippines; Andersen AFB, Guam, Naha AB, Okinawa and Itazuke AB, Misawa AB and Yokota AB, all in Japan for training of the interceptor squadrons assigned to those bases. The 6th TTS was inactivated by late 1957 and the Canberra trainers were designated a flight of the 8th Bombardment Squadron at Johnson AB. In Europe, USAFE supported a squadron of B-57E gunnery trainers at Wheelus AB, Libya where European-based interceptors deployed for \\"live firing\\" over the vast desert range there. To provide challenges for interceptors, The B-57Es towed styroforam, bomb-shaped radar reflectant targets. These could be towed at higher altitudes than the high-drag 45' banners but hits could still be scored on them. By 1960, the rocket firing interceptors were giving way to F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors firing heat-seeking AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles. This made the target towing mission of the B-57E obsolete, and the B-57Es were adapted to electronic countermeasures and faker target aircraft (EB-57E) (see below). In order to cover combat losses in the Vietnam War caused by two major ground explosions, twelve B-57Es were reconfigured as combat-capable B-57Bs at the Martin factory in late 1965 and were deployed to Southeast Asia for combat bombardment operations. Six other B-57Es were converted to RB-57E \\"Patricia Lynn\\" tactical reconnaissance aircraft in 1966 during the Vietnam War, operating from Tan Son Nhut Air Base until 1971. SAMs near the BOMARC Missile Accident Site after the 7 June 1960 BOMARC nuclear accident. BOMARC alert status ended in 1972, e.g., ADC first closed a BOMARC B complex on 31 December 1969. ;Interceptor Missiles (IMs): The Bomarc Missile Program delivered the first CIM-10 Bomarc supersonic surface-to-air missile to ADC during September 1959 at Fort Dix's BOMARC Base No. 1 near the missile launch control center on McGuire AFB (groundbreaking for McGuire's Air Defense Direction Center to house the IBM AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central for Bomarc ground-controlled interception had been in 1957.) To ensure probability of kill before bombers could drop their weapons, the AN/FSQ-7 used the Automatic Target and Battery Evaluation (ATABE) to determine which bombers/formations to assign to which manned interceptor base (e.g., using nuclear air-to-air missiles), which to assign to Bomarcs (e.g., with W-40 nuclear warheads) and if available, which to assign to the region's Nike Army Air Defense Command Post (that also had ATABE software for efficiently coordinating fire from multiple Hercules missile batteries.) Bomarc missiles bases were along the east and west coasts of North America and the central areas of the continent (e.g., Suffolk County Missile Annex was on Long Island, New York.) The supersonic Bomarc missiles were the first long-range anti-aircraft missiles in the world, and the longer range BOMARC B models required less time after erected until they could be launched.Gibson, James (2000), Nuclear Weapons of the United States: An Illustrated History, Schiffer Publishing, Ltd .

Retired 30 July 1979 \\"Faker\\", or simulated target aircraft flew mock penetrations into air defense sectors to exercise GDI stations, Air Defense Direction Centers, and interceptor squadrons. Initially using modified B-25 Mitchell and B-29 Superfortress bombers, the aircraft would fly attack profile missions at unexpected, random times and attempt to evade coverage by flying at low altitudes and randomly flying in different directions to confuse interceptors. The aircraft were modified to carry electronic countermeasures (ECM) gear to attempt to confuse radar operators. In 1957, the propeller-driven aircraft were phased out and replaced by Martin B-57 medium bombers which were being phased out of Tactical Air Command. Initially RB-57As from reconnaissance units were modified to have their former camera bays refitted to carry out the latest ECM systems to confuse the defenders. Wing racks, originally designed for bombs, now carried chaff dispensers and the navigator position was replaced with an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO). The modified B-57s were designated as EB-57 (E for special electronic installation).Mikesh, Robert C. Martin B-57 Canberra: The Complete Record.Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1995. . Considerable realism would be generated into these simulated aggressor attack missions being flown by the B-57 crews. Often several EB-57s were used to form separate tracks and provide a coordinated jamming attack to complicate the testing. When inside the range of the GCI radar, and in anticipation of interception, chaff was dispensed to confuse the defense force and electronic pulses to jam radar signals were turned on. It was up to the defending interceptors and GCI stations to sort out the correct interception. Units operating these specially equipped aircraft were designated Defense Systems Evaluation Squadrons (DSES). The 4713th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron was stationed for training in the Northeast. The 4713th also deployed frequently to USAFE in West Germany for training of NATO forces. The other was the 4677th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron, which concentrated on Fighter Interceptor Squadron training for units in the Western United States. In 1974, the 4713th DSES was inactivated and its EB-57s were divided between two Air National Guard units and the 4677th DSES was redesignated as the 17th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron. This unit was inactivated in July 1979 and was the last to fly B-57s in the active duty USAF. It shared the Defense Systems Evaluation mission with the Kansas and Vermont Air National Guard. Defense Systems Evaluation operations were also carried out by the 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron, Yokota AB, Japan; later the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron and moved to Kadena AB, Okinawa. EB-57s were also deployed to Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, frequently. The 134th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron, Vermont Air National Guard, retired its last EB-57 in 1983, and the operational use of the B-57 Canberra ended. to/from adjacent sectors' DCs and to 10 Nike Missile Master AADCPs. \\\\--> ADC squadrons at Thule Site J and Clear AFS used each AN/FPS-50 to sweep 2 radar beams each ~1¬∞ in azimuth x 3.5¬∞ elevation (illustrated much less thick).

Continental defense From 1 September 1954 until 1975, ADC was a component of the unified Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) along with the Army's ARAACOM (1957 ARADCOM) and until 1965, the Navy's NAVFORCONAD. The USAF as the executive CONAD agent initially used ADC's: *General Benjamin Chidlaw as CINCONAD, *headquarters staff and ADC HQ building for the unified command staff, and *new blockhouse for the unified command center ADC'a Permanent System radar stations were used for CONAD target data, along with Navy picket ships (Atlantic and Pacific Barrier until 1965) and Army Project Nike \\"target acquisition radars\\". A CONAD reorganization that started in 1956 created a separate multi-service CONAD headquarters staff (with Air Force Element), separated command of ADC from CINCONAD, and in 1957 added Alaskan Air Command and Northeast Air Command components to ADC‚Äîformer NEAC installations in a smaller \\"Canadian Northeast Area\\" were transferred under control of Royal Canadian Air Force ADC (e.g., the Hall Beach DEW Line station constructed 1955‚Äì1957 \\\\--cf.

On 1 March 1957 CONAD reduced the number of ADC interceptor squadrons on alert for the Air Defense Identification Zone.CONAD regulation 55-8 on 1 March 1957 (cited by CONAD Historical Summary July 1956 ‚Äì June 1957) \\"At the end of 1957, ADC operated 182 radar stations‚Ä¶32 had been added during the last half of the year as low-altitude, unmanned gap-filler radars.

Implementation of the SAGE Geographic Reorganization Plan of 25 July 1958 activated new ADC military installations, e.g., GATR stations for vectoring manned interceptors as well as BOMARC missile launch complexes with nearby GAT Facilities. On 20 December 1958 NORAD approved the \\"USAF ADC Plan\\" which included 10 Super Combat Centers (SCCs) in underground bunkers to replace 5 above-ground Combat Centers remaining to be built. Modification of FAA radars to the ARSR-1A configuration (Amplitron, \\"antenna gear box modification\\", etc.) were to be complete by November 1960 (e.g., at the Fort Heath radar station) and all 3 Texas Towers were in-service by April 1959 with ADC detachments/radars on offshore platforms near the New England coast, and the Continental Air Defense Integration North schedule for gap-filler radars included those for \\"P-20F, London, Ontario; C-4-C, Brampton, Ontario; C-5-C, Mt Carleton, New Brunswick; and C-6-D, Les Etroits.

Operational BMEWS control of the Thule Site J RCA AN/FPS-50 Radar Sets transferred from RCA to ADC on 5 January 1962 (the 12MWS activated in 1967.) By 30 June 1962, integration of ADC's BMEWS CC&DF; and the SPADATS Center was completed at Ent AFB, and the Air Forces Iceland transferred from Military Air Transport Service to ADC on 1 July 1962. The 9th ADD established the temporary 1962 \\"Cuban Missile Early Warning System\\" for the missile crisis. Responsibility for a USAFSS squadron's AN/FPS-17 radar station in Turkey for missile test monitoring transferred to ADC on 1 July 1963, the same date the site's AN/FPS-79 achieved IOC.NORAD Historical Summary, January‚ÄìJuly 1963. By January 1963, ADC's Detachment 3 of the 9th Aerospace Defense Division (9th ADD) was providing space surveillance data from the Moorestown BMEWS station \\"to a Spacetrack Analysis Center at Colorado Springs.\\" On 31 December 1965, Forward Scatter Over-the-Horizon network data from the 440L Data Reduction Center was being received by ADC for missile warning, and a NORAD plan for 1 April 1966 was for ADC to \\"reorganize its remaining 26th, 28th, 29th, and 73d Air Divisions into four air forces.\\"NORAD Historical Summary, July‚ÄìDecember 1965. The 1966 20th Surveillance Squadron began ADC's phased array operations with the Eglin AFB Site C-6 Project Space Track radar (the Eglin phased array's IOC was in 1969, and the North Dakota CMEWS \\"began passing\\" PARCS phased array data to NORAD in 1977 after being \\"modified for the ADCOM mission\\". After claiming in March 1958 that \\"the Army's ZEUS did not have the growth potential to handle possible enemy evasion decoy and countermeasure tactics\\", the USAF similarly identified by early 1959 that its planned Wizard missile was \\"not cost effective\\" against ICBM warheads. (cited by Leonard p. 113)‚Äîthe Army Zeus deployed successors against ICBMs (SAFEGUARD System, 1975-6) and space vehicles (Johnston Atoll, 1962‚Äì75). After tests of the 1959 High Virgo (at Explorer 5), 1959 Bold Orion (Explorer 6), and 1963 Project 505 (Nike Zeus) anti-satellite tests (the latter's nuclear burst destroyed a satellite), the Air Force Systems Command ASM-135 ASAT collided with a satellite in 1984. =Consolidated C3= ADC's Consolidated Command. Control and Communications Program, FY 1965‚Äì1972 was an outgrowth of a 196x \\"ADC-NORAD PAGE Study\\" for replacing SAGE/BUIC with a Primary Automated Ground Environment (PAGE) . The program with a Joint DOD/FAA National Airspace System (NAS) resulted with DOD/FAA agreements for a common aircraft surveillance system, with the FAA \\"to automate its new National Airspace System (NAS) centers\\". ADC estimated its portion \\"would cost about $6 million, with annual operating, maintenance, and communication costs about $3.5 million\\" (\\"the first BUIC III was set to begin in April 1967 at Z-50, Saratoga Springs\\".) As the space mission grew the command changed its name, effective 15 January 1968, to Aerospace Defense Command, or ADCOM. Under ADCOM, emphasis went to systems for ballistic missile detection and warning and space surveillance, and the atmospheric detection and warning system, which had been in an almost continuous state of expansion and improvement since the 1950s, went into decline. BOMARC, for example, was dropped from the weapons inventory, and the F-101 and F-102 passed from the regular Air Force inventory into the National Guard. To save funds and manpower, drastic reductions were made in the number of long range radar stations, the number of interceptor squadrons, and in the organizational structure. By 1968 the DOD was making plans to phase down the current air defense system and transition to a new system which included an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Over-the-Horizon Backscatter (OTH-B) radar, and an improved F-106 interceptor aircraft. The changing emphasis in the threat away from the manned bomber and to the ballistic missile brought reorganization and reduction in aerospace defense resources and personnel and almost continuous turmoil in the management structure. The headquarters of the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) and ADC were combined on 1 July 1973. Six months later in February 1973, ADC was reduced to 20 fighter squadrons and a complete phaseout of air defense missile batteries. Continental Air Command was disestablished on 1 July 1975 and Aerospace Defense Command became a specified command by direction of the JCS. Reductions and reorganizations continued into the last half of the 1970s, but while some consideration was given to closing down the major command headquarters altogether and redistributing field resources to other commands, such a move lacked support in the Air Staff. Inactivation Emblem of Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC) In early 1977 strong Congressional pressure to reduce management \\"overhead\\", and the personal conviction of the USAF Chief of Staff that substantial savings could be realized without a reduction in operational capability, moved the final \\"reorganization\\" of ADCOM to center stage. Two years of planning followed, but by late 1979 the Air Force was ready to carry it through. It was conducted in two phases: On 1 October 1979 ADCOM atmospheric defense resources (interceptors, warning radars, and associated bases and personnel) were transferred to Tactical Air Command. They were placed under Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), compatible to a Numbered Air Force under TAC. With this move many Air National Guard units that had an air defense mission also came under the control of TAC. ADTAC was headquartered at Ent Air Force Base, Colorado, with North American Aerospace Defense Command. In essence, Tactical Air Command became the old Continental Air Command. On the same date, electronic assets went to the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). On 1 December 1979 missile warning and space surveillance assets were transferred to Strategic Air Command. On the same date the Aerospace Defense Center, a Direct Reporting Unit, was established from the remnants of ADCOM headquarters. ADCOM, as a specified command, continued as the United States component of NORAD, but the major air command was inactivated on 31 March 1980. The unit designation of the MAJCOM reverted to the control of the Department of the Air Force. Commanders *Lt. Gen George Stratemeyer *Maj. Gen Gordon Saville *Lt.

In 1812, when the Junqueira family moved to S√£o Paulo state, the topography, the forest, the local culture and the different species of deer to hunt, forced them to seek for a horse with different characteristics, by the selection or crossing, and so they started to breed the Mangalarga horse with Thoroughbred, Arabian, and American Saddlebred stallions plus a Saddlebred mare and one Lusitano stallion. As the breed's popularity spread, breeders concentrated on developing different gaits within the breed without loss of the conformation and agility . Nowadays, this blood remains only by a few female lines, but these influences made the Mangalarga horse a different breed from the Mangalarga Marchador breed. The horse has a slightly long head but alert eyes and ears. A long muscular neck, prominent withers, a short, strong back, well-muscled hindquarters, and a high set tail gives this breed a fine appearance. It is found in colors of chestnut, bay, gray, and roan. Their common height is between 14.2-15.2 hands high. Thus work of Junqueira also developed the Mangalarga Marchador breed that differs from the Mangalarga due to the influence of different bloodlines and a focus on different traits. However, at the beginning, there was just one type of horse, the \\"Mangalarga Horse\\". However, today the two breeds are different from one another and each has its own studbook and breed associations. The Mangalarga exhibits both the picada and batida. The two names references differences in the desired gaits of each breed: Mangalarga Marchador = Triple contact base or support while marching, referencing that breed's desired ambling gait; Mangalarga = referring to a double (bipedal) contact base or support while marching. The Mangalarga horse breed has been registered by the ABCCRM since 1934.

It was developed by Sports Interactive and released exclusively for the PC in the spring of 1999. Gameplay Championship Manager 3 features new user interface and menu system. It primarily used a vertical menu bar on the left-hand side of the screen, as well as the traditional horizontal menu bars across the top and bottom of the screen. As well as the new menu system, many more high-resolution background images were added - these were mostly relevant to whatever screen the player was viewing. There were many small changes and improvements to the gameplay, including an improved match-engine, customisable training schedules, more cup competitions from around the world, a more in- depth tactics system, realistic reserve and youth squads, and improved player scouting. One major new addition was the ability to play multiplayer games via a local area network (LAN), allowing up to 16 people to compete against each other in the same game 'world'. This option could also be used to play over the internet. The hotseat multiplayer mode was also expanded to allow up to 16 people to play on the same machine. The database of players and staff swelled to over 25,000 for this version, again increasing the depth and realism of the game. Due to the increased player database and the massive amount of processing that the game needed to do, a 'multi-tasking' design was used. This allowed the computer to process data in the background while still allowing the player to do things like browse around the game, search for players, change tactics, etc. The number of playable leagues increased in this instalment to include league systems of fifteen nations were selectable. For the first time of playable leagues outside of Europe were included. Reception Championship Manager 3 received generally favourable reviews, and was consistently rated above 85%. PC Zone gave the game its highest rating (93%), praising the depth of its database and its ease of use, although it was marked down for its slow running speed on older hardware. The game was a hit in the United Kingdom.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/jun/17/onlinesupplement11 References Category:1999 video games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video game sequels Category:Association football management video games ","title":"Championship Manager 3"},{"id":"4149697","text":"The Journal of Multimedia was a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Academy Publisher.

It was described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801. At long, it is the smallest honeyeater in Australia. It has a short tail and relatively long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male is a striking bright red with black wings, while the female is entirely brown. It is more vocal than most honeyeaters, and a variety of calls have been recorded, including a bell- like tinkling. The scarlet myzomela is found along most of the eastern coastline, from Cape York in the far north to Gippsland in Victoria. It is migratory in the southern parts of its range, with populations moving north in the winter. Its natural habitat is forest, where it forages mainly in the upper tree canopy. It is omnivorous, feeding on insects as well as nectar. Up to three broods may be raised over the course of a breeding season. The female lays two or rarely three flecked white eggs in a diameter cup-shaped nest high in a tree. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population. Taxonomy The scarlet myzomela was depicted in three paintings in a set of early illustrations known as the Watling drawings, done in the first years of European settlement of Sydney between 1788 and 1794. Based on these, English ornithologist John Latham described it as three separate species in 1801. He based the description of Certhia sanguinolenta on an immature male moulting into adult plumage with incomplete red colouration, calling it the sanguineous creeper. In the same publication he described Certhia dibapha, the cochineal creeper, and C. erythropygia, the red-rumped creeper. English naturalist James Francis Stephens called it Meliphaga sanguinea in 1826 as a replacement name for Latham's Certhia sanguinolenta. John Gould determined Latham's three names to be the one species in 1843, adopting the first-written binomial name as the valid one and relegating the others to synonymy, though the name Myzomela dibapha was occasionally used, particularly in New Caledonia. In 1990, Ian McAllan proposed that the first drawing did not confirm the species identity and proposed the name Myzomela dibapha to hence be the oldest validly published name; however, Richard Schodde countered in 1992 that the drawing of an immature male could not be of any other species, meaning that M. sanguinolenta should stand. He added that the alternative proposed name had not been in use since the 1850s. The Wakolo myzomela, Sulawesi myzomela, Banda myzomela, and New Caledonian myzomela were all previously considered to be conspecific with the scarlet myzomela. There are no recognized subspecies nor regional variations; differences in observed plumage are due to wear after moulting. This species is commonly known as the scarlet honeyeater in Australia and scarlet myzomela elsewhere, the latter name being adopted as the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Gould used Latham's name of sanguineous honeyeater in the 19th century, which persisted into the early 20th century. Other common names are soldier-bird (as the male appears to wear a red coat) and blood-bird. An early colonial name was little soldier. A 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters found the scarlet myzomela to be most closely related to the cardinal myzomela, with their common ancestor diverging from a lineage that led to the red-headed myzomela, although only five of the thirty members of the genus Myzomela were analysed. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the ancestor of the scarlet myzomela diverged from that of the Banda myzomela around 2 million years ago, but the relationships of many species within the genus are uncertain. Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Description The smallest honeyeater native to Australia, the scarlet myzomela is a distinctive bird with a compact body, short tail and relatively long down- curved black bill and dark brown iris. It is between long, with an average wingspan of and a weight of . It has relatively long wings for its size; when the wings are folded, the longest primary feathers reach over half the length of the tail. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the male much more brightly coloured than the female. The adult male has a bright red (scarlet) head, nape and upper breast, with a narrow black stripe from beak to eye and a thin black eye-ring. The red plumage extends as a central stripe down the back and rump. On its breast, the red becomes more mottled with grey towards the belly and flanks, which are grey-white. The sides of the breast are brown-black. The mantle and scapulars are black and the upperwing a dull black, with white edges to the secondary covert feathers. The tail is black above and dark grey below. The underwing is white with a dark grey trailing edge and tip. The female has a brown head and neck, darker on top and lighter and greyer on the sides, with a pale grey-brown throat and chin. It sometimes has pinkish or reddish patches on the forehead, throat and cheeks. The upperparts are brown, sometimes with scarlet patches on the uppertail coverts. The tail is blackish- brown with yellow fringes to all but the central pair of rectrices. The wings are blackish-brown. The female has a yellowish or brownish base to its black bill. Moulting takes place over spring and summer. Young birds have juvenile plumage when they leave the nest; they are similar to females though with more reddish-brown upperparts, light brown rumps and uppertail coverts. Immature males, after moulting from juvenile plumage, have patches of red feathers coming through the juvenile brown plumage. Immature females are very difficult to distinguish from juveniles or adult females. Both sexes attain adult plumage after two moults. It is unknown whether its plumage changes with moults after the scarlet myzomela attains adulthood. The scarlet myzomela is more commonly heard than seen, and has a wider repertoire of notes in its calls than most honeyeaters. The male is more vocal than the female. The main call is a tuneful tinkling call made up of sets of six notes that rise or fall in tone. It has been likened to cork being rubbed on glass. The female chirps as it hops around and upon meeting and playing with the male, and it can also make a squeaking call. Both sexes make a short chiew-chiew as a contact call. Males could be mistaken for the similar looking red-headed myzomela in eastern Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland where their ranges overlap, though the latter's red colouration is restricted to the head and is sharply demarcated. The latter species also lives in mangroves rather than woodlands. The dusky myzomela resembles the female scarlet myzomela, but is larger with a longer bill and tail, has much darker brown plumage, and lacks the pink tinge to the face and throat. Distribution and habitat Adult male foraging at Melaleuca flowers in Queensland The scarlet myzomela is found from Cooktown in Far North Queensland down the east coast to Mitchell River National Park in Gippsland, Victoria. It is rarer south of the Hacking River in New South Wales. Its range extends inland to Charters Towers, Carnarvon Gorge and Inglewood in Queensland, and the Warrumbungles in New South Wales. It is a rare vagrant to Melbourne. The species' movements are not well known, but it appears to be migratory in the southern part of its range and more sedentary in the north. Populations of scarlet myzomelas move northwards up a portion of the Australian east coast for winter. Nomadic movements of populations, generally following the flowering of preferred food plants, also occur. Population numbers have been reported as fluctuating in some areas, with local movements possibly related to the flowering of preferred food plants. Local irruptions have occurred in Sydney in 1902 (during a drought), 1981, 1991 (both in northwestern Sydney), and 1994 (centred on Lane Cove River valley), in Nowra in 1980, across southern Victoria in 1985, and in the Eurobodalla district in 1991 and 1993. A field study in Mangerton over 18 years found that scarlet myzomelas arrived in the area in early Spring (August) and left by November, though they were entirely absent in three separate years. The maximum age recorded from banding has been just over 10 years, in a bird caught south of Mount Cotton in Queensland. Its habitat is dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, generally with eucalypts as the dominant trees and where there is little understory. Scarlet myzomelas are encountered alone, in pairs, or in small troops, sometimes with other honeyeaters in the canopy of trees in flower. Behaviour Turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), a commonly-foraged tree The scarlet myzomela is territorial, with males advertising their territories by singing from the tops of trees. They compete with members of the same species, and are usually driven away from some feeding areas by hungry larger honeyeaters, such as Lewin's, New Holland, white-naped, and brown honeyeaters, as well as eastern spinebills and noisy friarbirds. In particular, breeding New Holland honeyeaters actively drive off scarlet myzomelas. Breeding The species breeds from winter through to summer, generally beginning around July or August and winding up in January. There have been odd records of nesting in April or May. A pair generally raises one or two broods a year. Nest failures may lead to a third brood, with females able to lay eggs around three weeks after the previous young have fledged. The nest consists of a tiny cup of shredded bark with spider web as binding, high up in the tree canopy, or even in mistletoe. Trees with dense foliage, such as lillypilly (Syzygium smithii), Pittosporum species, turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), mangroves, species of paperbark, eucalypts or wattles (Acacia spp.) are more often chosen as nesting sites. The nest is around in diameter, and takes around 8 days to build before eggs are laid in it. Both sexes build the nest, though some observations have the male doing the bulk of construction and others the female. Alfred J. North observed that the females alone collected nesting material, such as spiderwebs and bark, tearing bark off such trees as the rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda). The clutch size is mostly two but occasionally three eggs. Measuring long and wide, the small eggs are white with the larger end flecked with dull red-brown or grey- purple. Eggs are laid a day apart, and the female is thought to incubate the eggs alone. The young are born naked, but are soon covered in down. They spend 11‚Äì12 days in the nest before fledging. Both parents feed their young. Feeding Scarlet Honeyeater feeding on flowering Callistemon in Mallacoota, Victoria The scarlet myzomela is arboreal, foraging in the crowns of trees, darting from flower to flower, probing for nectar with its long curved bill. It sometimes hovers in front of flowers while feeding. Trees visited include turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), paperbarks (Melaleuca spp.), and banksias. The scarlet myzomela is omnivorous, and also feeds on insects as well as nectar, sallying for flying insects in the canopy. Insects eaten include beetles, flies, bugs, and caterpillars. Conservation status The scarlet myzomela is listed as being a species of least concern by the IUCN, on account of its large range (1,960,000 square km) and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline. Aviculture Scarlet myzomelas are rarely seen in aviculture, though they have been kept by enthusiasts in Sydney. As all honeyeaters are territorial, they tend to be aggressive in mixed-species aviaries. Various state regulations govern the keeping of the species; in South Australia, for instance, a Specialist Licence is required, while in New South Wales a Class B2 (Advanced Bird) licence is required. Applicants for the New South Wales B2 licence must have at least 2 years' experience keeping birds, and be able to demonstrate that they can provide the appropriate care and housing for the species they wish to obtain.

Miho uses Japanese swords of various sizes, and shuriken in the shape of the manji, as seen in The Big Fat Kill and Family Values. She is also skilled with the longbow and has various other small weaponry tucked in her clothing. She utilizes a wide array of weapons, such as katana, wakizashi and kusarigama. On the DVD commentary track for the film, Quentin Tarantino states that after he suggested that Miho's swords were made by Hattori Hanz≈ç, writer/director Frank Miller enthusiastically agreed. Much of Miho's past remains a mystery. Three years before the events of A Dame To Kill For, she was saved by Dwight during an attack by Tong gangsters. As Dwight himself explains to Goldie and Wendy, \\"three of the Tong who attacked Miho were dead by her hand. But the last two had her dead to rights. Point blank range.\\" Because of this incident, she owes a debt of honor to Dwight. Subsequently, Dwight is the only male character she is ever shown to have any non-lethal interaction with, even taking orders from him at one point. They have some sort of friendship, as he is also the only character she ever shows any physical attraction or affection towards. In a fight Miho typically uses her swords to \\"play\\" with her opponent (in Family Values Dwight likens her to a cat), often dodging her opponent's blows while hitting him/her (with seeming ease) in return. She would appear to be a modern-day master of traditional ninjutsu as she tends to rely on stealth, evasion, and counterattacks more than directly engaging an opponent. This puts to good use her acrobatic/gymnastic ability and knowledge of pressure points, veins, and arteries. She is also sometimes seen using roller-skates to get around, much as Carrie Kelley did as Catgirl in Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, which was also written by Frank Miller. Frank Miller has stated in the Sin City: Recut and Extended DVD commentary that Kevin and Miho are the supernatural beings in Sin City. Miller characterizes them as \\"demons\\"; Miho is a good \\"demon\\" and Kevin is an evil one. They share many similarities: they both never speak and are not even seen with their mouths open. They are the most skilled characters in martial arts (though they never fought Wallace), and never show any sign of pain. So far, Miho was never shown seriously injured and defeated all her opponents with relative ease, although Dwight stated in A Dame to Kill For that he rescued her from a hopeless situation with Asian Tong gangsters. Appearances Miho has appeared in four of the Sin City yarns (aside from the film adaptations): *A Dame to Kill For (1993) - After Dwight is shot multiple times and he discovers Ava Lord has been manipulating him to commit murder, he flees to Old Town. He seeks refuge from Gail, and in order to gain the help of the Girls of Old Town, he tells the story of saving Miho's life from Tong gangsters. As according to honor, the girls are obligated to help him in his plan for revenge. Miho is instrumental during the fight with Manute at Ava Lord's estate, stopping him from reaching Dwight and crucifying him through the arms with her twin swords. This leads Manute to have a great disdain for the Old Town girls. *The Big Fat Kill (1994-1995) - Miho is responsible for incapacitating and murdering Jackie Boy when he attempts to kidnap one of the Old Town girls. After Dwight discovers that Jackie Boy is a police officer, he attempts to prevent a war between the Old Town girls and the police by disposing of the body in the tar pits. Upon arrival, he is attacked by Irish mercenaries sent by Wallenquist, who steal Jackie Boy's severed head and leave Dwight to drown in the tar pits. As Dwight sinks beneath the surface of the pits, Miho dives in and rescues him. *The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories (1994) *Family Values (1997) - Miho and Dwight get involved in a mob war between the families of Don Magliozzi and Boss Wallenquist, after being told about a recent mob hit. Dwight is soon kidnapped by Vito, who is the nephew of Magliozzi, and is driven toward the Projects. Unknown to the hitmen is that Miho has been following Dwight to make sure that he is protected. Upon mention, Miho kills Spinelli, one of the goons, and they park in a hilltop rest area, overlooking the Projects. There, Miho \\"toys\\" with Vinnie, a hitman who spends the whole fight hurling slurs at her, as Dwight tells Vito to kill the other hitman, which is Vito's own brother Luca. After Miho and Dwight are through, they head straight to Sacred Oaks to confront Don Magliozzi, driven by Vito. Miho simply cuts through the guards and Dwight makes his appearance. He tells the Don he is going to die along with Vito for the accidental death of Carmen, one of the Old Town girls. She was also supposed to appear in the video game adaptation of Sin City, which was canceled in 2008. An action figure based on the first film's version of the character was released by NECA.

Birds from southwestern Australia have been shown to be a distinct species, Gilbert's honeyeater, and the eastern birds are more closely related to the black-headed honeyeater of Tasmania. One of several similar species of black-headed honeyeaters in the genus Melithreptus, it dwells in dry sclerophyll eucalypt woodland. Its diet consists of nectar from various flowers, and it also feeds on insects.  Taxonomy  The white-naped honeyeater was originally described as Certhia lunata by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1802.Vieillot, L.P. (1802). Oiseaux dor√©s au a reflets metalliques. (published in 32 parts). Paris Vol. 2 [95]. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin luna, meaning 'moon'; this refers to the crescent-shaped, white marking on its nape. It is a member of the genus Melithreptus, with several species of similar size and (apart from the brown-headed honeyeater) black-headed appearance, in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. The next closest relative outside the genus is the much larger, but similarly marked, blue-faced honeyeater. More recently, DNA analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. Gilbert's honeyeater, found in southwest Western Australia, was initially described as a separate species by John Gould in 1844,Gould, J. (1848). The Birds of Australia. 104 pls. London: J. Gould Vol. 4 [pl. 73]. before being reclassified as a subspecies of the white-naped for many years. However, a molecular study published in 2010 showed that it had diverged before the split of populations in eastern Australia into the white- naped and black-headed honeyeaters.  Description  A mid-sized honeyeater at in length, it is olive-green above and white below, with a black head, nape and throat, a red patch over the eye, and a white crescent-shaped patch on the nape. It is thinner than other similar species. Juveniles have brownish crowns and an orange base of the bill. Its call is a mjerp mjerp.  Ecology  It is found in eucalypt forest and woodlands. Its diet is principally nectar from a variety of flowers, supplemented by insects and various other invertebrates. Breeding SE Queensland, Australia White-naped honeyeaters may nest from July to December, breeding once or twice during this time. The nest is a thick-walled bowl of grasses and bits of bark in the fork of a tall tree, usually a eucalypt. Two or three eggs are laid, 18 x 14 mm in size, and shiny, buff-pink, sparsely spotted with red-brown.

White-plumed honeyeaters are common around water and are often seen in backyards and suburbs with vegetation cover. Taxonomy First described by English naturalist John Gould in 1837, the specimen he examined came from ‚Äúthe interior of New South Wales‚Äù. The species epithet penicillata derives from the Latin word penicillis meaning 'brush tip', referring to the white plume across the side of the neck. He placed the species in Meliphaga, where it would remain for almost 150 years. In 1975, Australian naturalist Richard Schodde split Meliphaga and placed the species in Lichenostomus. With the introduction of molecular studies, it was apparent that the white-plumed honeyeater belonged in a clade within Lichenostomus. This had first been suggested by Mathews in 1915, who placed it with the Yellow-tinted honeyeater in a genus he named Ptilotula; but this was rejected by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. The Ptilotula clade was finally promoted to genus after new molecular evidence was published in 2011. The generic name Ptilotula derives from Ancient Greek ptilon 'feather' and the diminutive of otis 'ear'. The species is probably of Miocene origin, with a fossil fragment found in Riversleigh, Queensland, appearing very similar to the white-plumed honeyeater leg-bone. Description A juvenile white-plumed honeyeater (P. p. penicillatus) at Toorale Station, NSW The plumage does not differ between the sexes. The distinguishing characteristic is a conspicuous white plume across the neck from the throat to the edge of the nape. The top of head and neck are olive, with a yellow eye-ring surrounding a black-brown to olive-brown eye. Cheeks and ear coverts are yellow-olive, with the rear coverts tipped black, creating a short black stripe along the anterior edge of the neck plume. The chin and throat are dull yellowish-olive. The upperparts are uniform grey- olive and the uppertail coverts have a yellowish tinge. Upperwing coverts are mostly brown with olive to yellow-olive tips or edges, creating a somewhat scalloped appearance. Remiges are dark brown with yellowish edges to secondaries, forming a yellow-olive panel when the wing is folded. Uppertail is olive-brown with yellow-olive outer edges. Underbody is mainly light brown- grey, with pale yellow streaks in the centre of the breast, pale yellow on the upper belly, flanks and undertail coverts, and cream on the lower belly. Underwing coverts are off-white with brown-grey remiges. Undertail is brownish grey. The feet and legs are pinkish to purplish grey. During breeding season, the bill and gape are black; however, outside of breeding the bill obtains an orange-yellow or orange-brown base (only on the lower mandible in some individuals) with a yellow gape. Four subspecies are recognised: Ptilotula penicillata penicillata, P. p. leilavalensis, P. p. carteri and P. p. calconi. P. p. leilavalensis is paler and yellower, P. p. carteri is strongly tinged yellow, and P. p. calconi yellower. These subspecies intergrade where ranges overlap. In all four races, males are slightly larger than females. P. p. penicillata is the largest, with males averaging and females . P. p. leilavalensis and P. p. carteri are similar in size, where males are around and females. P. p. calconi is the smallest, with males around and females around . Wing lengths are much larger in penicillatus, and bill lengths differ only slightly, with the bill of P. p. carteri being somewhat longer than the other three subspecies. Juveniles are similar to adults, but with duller colours on the top of head and neck, and brighter colours on the eye-ring and ear coverts. The plume is shorter and less distinct, often lacking the black border of the ear coverts. Underbody is slightly more brown. The bill is pink or yellowish with a brown tip in young individuals, changing to black with a yellow-orange or pinkish base; while the gape is yellow and noticeably puffy looking. In newly fledged birds, the feet and legs are a paler pinkish-brown and appear swollen compared to the adult. Distribution and habitat The species is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Australia (excluding Tasmania), up towards central Australia with patches occurring in central and western Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. They are absent from desert areas but can persist in arid regions where trees and especially standing water are present. The nominate race, P. p. penicillatus, occurs throughout south-eastern Australia to the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, and throughout the Murray-Darling basin. P. p. leilavalensis is found from Lake Eyre south to the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, east to the Barrier Ranges in western New South Wales, west to the edges of the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and north to central-western Queensland. P. p. carteri occurs in the Pilbara region of WA from Geraldton to the Fortescue Ranges, and east to the Western Deserts; while P. p. calconi is known only from the southern Kimberley region. The species has undergone range expansion in the last century. It was formerly linked closely to the distribution of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and a few other riverine species; but it has since expanded into coastal areas to become resident in Sydney and Newcastle, where they were previously uncommon or only seasonal visitors. Banding studies indicate that the species is primarily sedentary, with 99.8% of recaptures occurring less than from the banding site. Small local movements occur, perhaps in response to environmental conditions. An oligotypic species, it is mainly found in open sclerophyll woodland, often near water sources, such as wetlands, swamps, creeks, and dams. It is found extensively in river red gum woodlands, but also riparian woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus, Melaleuca or Casuarina species. It may also be found in nearby river flats or open forest and woodland. Diet The white-plumed honeyeater's diet consists mainly of nectar, insects and their products (e.g., honeydew and lerp), manna, fruit, and very occasionally seeds. They may also peck at berries to feed on juice. Where sufficient standing water occurs, P. penicillata can be observed drinking at least twice per day. In xeric habitats, additional moisture is obtained from food. A study in the Pilbara region of Western Australia found that white-plumed honeyeaters must eat around 100 berries to obtain 1mL of water. Needing 5-10mL per day, white-plumed honeyeaters were able to feed on 500‚Äì1000 berries in a five-hour period in order to obtain both caloric requirements and sufficient water intake. Foraging behaviour White- plumed honeyeaters mainly feed by gleaning leaf surfaces. The tongue contains brush-like filaments, consisting of about 60 bristles, which are capable of mopping up nectar. Arthropod prey is usually taken by gleaning, but some prey is taken on the wing. In urban areas, they are typically canopy foragers but foraging heights can vary, depending on the influence of other resident species. For example, in the presence of aggressive competitors, such as fuscous honeyeaters, white-plumed honeyeaters avoid conflict by modifying their foraging behaviour. In one location, where ranges of the two species overlapped, white-plumed honeyeaters fed at lower heights in the overlap zone than they did in the riparian zone, where fuscous honeyeaters were absent. Information on diet comes from scats, stomach contents, and foraging observations. Stomach contents are heavily biased toward strong tissues from plants and arthropods. In 1980, it was found that manna, honeydew, and lerp were extremely important food resources. Other research indicated that insects were only a small part of the diet, when they were previously thought to be major components. Insects are sometimes taken on the wing, but probably only provide a protein and mineral source, as a surplus of energy is available in nectar, lerp, and manna. The lower proportion of insects in the diet is a consequence of the fact that more energy is spent hawking prey than can be redeemed from the prey. Social behaviour This is a gregarious species, often found in groups of 12 or more individuals during the nonbreeding season. These larger groups then dissipate during breeding. P. penicillata is considered colonial, with observations of colonies throughout their range. There is some suggestion of cooperative breeding, but if occurring it is uncommon. Communal breeding is likely, with conspecifics grouping to attack predators near nests. However, individual territories within communities are maintained, with territorial song frequency increasing during the breeding season. Experiments with captive populations indicate that hierarchies form, based on plumage colour, gape flange characters, and voice, but no data from wild populations exists. Observations of aggressive interactions between conspecifics and other species, such as the yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and smaller species, such as pardalotes (Pardalotus spp.), mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum), and other small honeyeaters have been made. There are some observations of attacks on fuscous honeyeaters, but the two species tend to avoid each other, where they occur sympatrically. In some regions, smaller birds are absent, due to the aggressive nature of white- plumed honeyeaters and other species of similar size, resulting in the exclusion of these poorer competitors. Foraging groups may use a chip-chip contact call, or a song which is repeated by nearby individuals. Corroborees of up to 12 or more individuals, sitting together on a branch, have been observed, which engage in extensive calling, followed by rapid dispersal. Breeding The cup nestNest with two eggsFemales are relatively more ready to breed from late winter through to summer; however, males maintain enlarged testes throughout the year. Breeding occurs throughout their range with records in all months, and clutches typically produced 2‚Äì3 times per year. Breeding events usually coincide with outbreaks of herbivorous insects. Nests are small and cup-shaped, in diameter and similar depth. These are skillfully woven from grasses and fine bark strips, bound with spider webs, and lined with animal hair, wool, and feathers.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. The female appears to be responsible for construction, but both sexes maintain and make repairs. Nests are usually located among the foliage in crowns of trees or shrubs, and only rarely seen in mistletoe. Sometimes nests are constructed in forks or on branches, and rarely in dead foliage.Higgins, P., L. Christidis, and H. Ford (2020). \\"White-plumed Honeyeater (Ptilotula penicillata), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.whphon1.01 There is some evidence of site fidelity, and nest trees may be shared with active nests maintained by several other species, including wagtails, magpie-lark, woodswallows, and other honeyeater species. Males undertake a song flight display, with a slight climbing and undulating flight above treetops while singing. At the song's completion, the male dives quickly into a nearby tree. This is performed throughout the day during breeding season, but less commonly in the early morning. Playback of this song does not induce territorial responses, suggesting the display is sexual in function. Other songs heard commonly after the breeding period begins may also have courtship functions. The clutch is usually 2‚Äì3 eggs, varying from 1‚Äì4 overall. The second egg is typically laid within 24 hours of the first. Eggs are approximately , weighing ; oval, smooth, finely grained, and may be slightly glossy. Colour varies from white to pale buff or deep pink, minutely spotted with chestnut-red freckles towards the larger end.Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. Eggs laid late in season tend to be lighter, and those from inland populations tend to be white with fewer markings. Incubation is most likely solely by the female for a period of 13‚Äì15 days. Both parents feed the offspring during the nestling period of 11‚Äì15 days, and then for a further 2 weeks after fledging until independence. The nests are parasitized by pallid (Cacomantis pallidus) and fan-tailed cuckoos (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and Horsfield's (Chrysococcyx basalis) and shining bronze-cuckoos (Chrysococcyx lucidus). Conservation status The white- plumed honeyeater is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. Threats Exotic vertebrate predators, such as cats and dogs, are a direct threat to white- plumed honeyeater populations. Loss of trees from watercourses will impact a population; however, they are able to adapt to suburban environments, especially where native gardens are present. Climate effects The white- plumed honeyeater body-size has been observed to change over recent decades, with individuals becoming smaller in extended drought, but showing an overall trend towards larger body-size since the 1960s. This is correlated with increasing temperatures in the regions surveyed, with body size increasing by 0.064% per year.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs. Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern New South Wales and Victoria. They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season. Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas. Taxonomy The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae. French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869. The specific name chrysops is derived from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers. The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. Five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. The generic name derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago. There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews in 1912. There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the Atherton Tableland in Queensland. The latter race is described as \\"poorly differentiated\\" and \\"possibly not worthy of recognition\\" by the Handbook of the Birds of the World. The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790. Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler. John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848, which has become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call. Description A distinctive yellow stripe runs below the eye. Appearance The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head. Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the ear coverts. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish- brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages in length, with a wingspan of , and a weight of , with an average of ). Vocalizations One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put- put. Distribution and habitat The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs. Habitat Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats‚Äîin open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in riparian woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light, shrubby understorey, and less often in dry, open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants. Range The yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near Cooktown in Far North Queensland, and between a line from Charters Towers south to Albury and the coast, and then west to the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. Population densities have been recorded from 0.01 birds per hectare (2.5 acres) near Armidale in New South Wales to 7.8 birds per hectare at Tarnagulla, Victoria. During the winter months of June and July, numbers are generally lower in Victoria and higher in Queensland, following their northward migration. Migration There are resident populations of the yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, but it is for the most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May), it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of 1,000 or more. The groups can include other species, such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird, and silvereye. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings Point in New South Wales over the course of a single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields, and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments, where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed, indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and the South Pole, rather than north and south. Their flight is in one general direction, but is not in a straight line, as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges, and detour around cities. The migration of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, has generally been described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. The yellow-faced honeyeater has been found to have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass. Behaviour Piercing the base of a mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) flower to feed on nectar The yellow-faced honeyeater is usually seen singly, in pairs or in small family groups, when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds, and during migration in larger groups. They sometimes feed in large, mixed-species, foraging flocks, composed predominately of insectivorous birds. Feeding Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow- faced honeyeater is thought to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet consists of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree-trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, sallying, catching in flight, or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles, and spiders. A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and green spider- flower (Grevillea mucronulata). In April and May, before the autumn migration, the yellow-faced honeyeater increases its nectar consumption, which increases its body mass. The average body mass in late autumn of is 13% higher than the average recorded between January and April, and the yellow-faced honeyeater begins the migration with healthy fat reserves. Breeding Three chicks are raised in a flimsy nest in a garden shrub. The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a breeding season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics and other species including thornbills, spinebills and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within a breeding season, females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds have been identified in the same territory for periods of up to five years. The nest is built in the understorey shrubs, relatively close to the ground. Nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma (Coprosma quadrifida), Cassinia, tea-trees (Melaleuca), eucalypts and acacias, as well as in garden shrubs. The nest is a fragile, cup-shaped structure, swollen at the sides and narrower at the rim. The female builds the nest, but is often accompanied by the male as she gathers nesting material. Most nests are built of greenish material, which varies with the location; in coastal areas, grass is the primary material; in mountain forests, the nest is often covered with moss. One bird was recorded repeatedly flying between the nest and a koala away and plucking the long hair near its ears to incorporate in the nest. The nests are very fine, with the eggs visible through the gauze-like walls, and they sometimes fall apart. They have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings falling through the bottom. The female undertakes the incubation alone. Eggs are oval, approximately long and wide, and pinkish white in colour with spots and blotches of dark reddish-brown. The clutch size varies from one to three eggs, and eggs take around two weeks to hatch. Upon hatching, both parents feed the nestlings and remove faecal pellets. The chicks fledge after thirteen days, and leave the parental territory after a further two weeks. The success rate can be as low as 16% of eggs developing into fledged young, with nest failure, hot weather, heavy rain, human activity (including fungicide spraying and nest damage), egg destruction by brood parasites, and predation by brown snakes, cats, and currawongs, all recorded as contributing to brood failure. Among the species that parasitize the nests of yellow-faced honeyeaters are fan-tailed cuckoos, brush cuckoos, pallid cuckoos, shining bronze-cuckoos, and Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos. The yellow-faced honeyeater promptly nests again after both successful and failed breeding attempts. A paternity analysis of yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity in the case of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood-rearing, and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics that are exhibited by the yellow honeyeater, for example. Conservation status Several ectoparasites, which can affect survival and reproductive fitness, have been found on the yellow-faced honeyeater: the mites, Ptilonyssus meliphagae and P. thymanzae, and Ixodes species ticks. In general, honeyeaters require extensive corridors of mature trees along their migratory routes, and flowering woodlands for nesting, so they are vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing and weed infestation. The woodland habitat they prefer is considered an endangered ecological community. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation. A field experiment to determine whether yellow-faced honeyeater nests were less successful in fragmented habitats found that nests closer to forest margins actually had a higher success rate than those deeper in the forest. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants; experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no increase in the number of avian predators at the forest edge. The results of the field experiment did not support the \\"ecological trap\\" and \\"predator influx\\" theories, and contribute to a belief that fragmented habitats may not be as problematic as previously thought. In some areas, the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens, where it damages fruit.

Wasp orchids are terrestrial herbs which grow in colonies of genetically identical plants. They usually have two leaves at the base of the plant and a single resupinate (\\"upside-down\\") flower. The labellum is more or less diamond-shaped and has calli resembling the body of a wingless female wasp.Labelled image of Chiloglottis formicifera Taxonomy and naming The genus Chiloglottis was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown. Brown described Chiloglottis diphylla at the same time, making it the type species. David Jones has transferred some species, especially those commonly known as \\"bird orchids\\" (Simpliglottis) and \\"ant orchids\\" (Myrmechila) to other genera, but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution This genus of orchids is native to Australia and New Zealand (including Chatham Island and the Antipodes Islands).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Ecology The flowers of wasp, ant and bird orchids are pollinated by sexual deception (pseudocopulation) of thynnine wasps, except for C. cornuta which is self- pollinating. A key feature is that each species of orchid is pollinated by a different species of wasp. Male wasps are attracted by wind-borne pheromones released by glands on the sepals of the flowers. They usually land on the labellum, on another part of the plant or nearby and then walk or fly to the labellum. They crawl over the labellum, searching for the female wasp. They then attempt to lift and fly away with the dummy female but this action brings them into contact with the column. If the insect has pollinia from another orchid on its back, the contained pollen will attach to the sticky stigma. Alternatively, if there are no pollinia on its back, the insect may move backward, receive a coat of glue from the flower's rostellum, then push open the anther and removing any pollinia present, which adhere to the insect's thorax.

The group released three studio albums, as well as several singles and EPs, before breaking up in 2004. History Willie Campbell, Charles Clark and Gareth Russell were childhood friends who moved from the Isle of Lewis, off the West coast of Scotland, to Glasgow in the mid 1990s. There, the three began writing songs together; Campbell on vocals, Clark on acoustic guitar and Russell on bass guitar. They then met up with drummer Gareth Thom and began rehearsing in 1997. The group called themselves \\"Astrid\\" and quickly caught the attention of Belle & Sebastian who asked them to be their opening act, initially at a local gig and then on a small tour of the UK. Astrid signed up with Fantastic Plastic Records, under whose record label they released their first EP in 1998, No Reason. The group then teamed with former Orange Juice singer, Edwyn Collins, who produced their second EP, Hi-Fi Lo-Fi, which was also released in 1998. A single \\"It's True\\" was released the same year. Collins went to produce the group's debut album the following year, Strange Weather Lately. The album received positive reviews and sold well in the UK and in Europe, although no American distributor could be found. The band's sound was compared to that of fellow Scottish indie bands The Pastels and Teenage Fanclub. A further EP called Modes of Transport was released in September 2000. The main single from the EP was made Single of the Week by Radio 1 DJ Simon Mayo, gaining further publicity and airplay for the group. As the band began recording their second full album, Thom left and was replaced by Neil Payne. Play Dead, the group's second album, was released in March 2001. In 2004, Astrid released their third album - One In Four (named for the statistic that \\"one in four of us will suffer mental health problems at some time in our lives\\"). Whilst maintaining the pop sound of their earlier material, the new album featured darker lyrical content. Campbell left the band shortly afterwards, and the band broke up by the end of the year. Neil Payne has since played drums for fellow Scottish band, Texas, Gareth Russell has played bass for Idlewild, Charlie Clark joined The Zephyrs, for their fourth studio album and went on to form now defunct bands Cold Night Song and Our Lunar Activities, and William Campbell formed Our Small Capital and The Open Day Rotation. Both Campbell and Clark continue to work on their solo careers. Astrid reformed in the summer of 2016 for a series of gigs throughout Scotland, and began recording material for a planned new album.

Directed by George Sherman, it stars Richard Conte and Coleen Gray.. The film is notable for its photography, and was one of the few motion pictures of the era to be shot entirely on location. The Sleeping City is viewed by critics as one of the best examples of the use of betrayal‚Äîin this instance, several layers of betrayal‚Äîas a noir plot device. However, as is typical in this genre/style, the film is simply plotted and economical in its characterizations. The movie begins with an unusual prologue, featuring Conte, to assure the audience that the story is \\"completely fictional\\" and did not take place at Bellevue or New York City. The prologue was inserted at the insistence of New York mayor William O'Dwyer, who had objected to the script as besmirching the reputation of the city-run hospital. Plot An intern is shot mysteriously on an East River pier adjoining Bellevue Hospital. The chief investigating detective views this as a difficult case, so with the cooperation of the Commissioner of Hospitals he assigns a detective who had been a medical corpsman, Fred Rowan of the Confidential Squad, to go undercover as intern \\"Fred Gilbert.\\" Rowan becomes involved with the attractive nurse Ann Sebastian (Coleen Gray), and also becomes friendly with the popular elevator operator, Pop Ware (Richard Taber). Ware, who works part-time taking bets, seems initially to be a benign character. But it becomes apparent that Ware has been loaning money to the interns, including the slain intern and another intern, Rowan's roommate Steve Anderson (Alex Nicol), who is depressed and commits suicide. Rowan deliberately loses money betting with Ware, and Ware says that Rowan can pay off his bet by stealing \\"white stuff\\"‚Äînarcotics. Rowan plays along, encouraged by Ann Sebastian. He stops providing drugs to Ware. Ware tries to kill Rowan, and is shot in a shootout on the roof of the hospital. Investigators find that the nurse worked as a courier for Ware. The movie ends with Rowan, turning aside pleas from Ann, placing her under arrest. Cast * Richard Conte as Fred Rowan * Coleen Gray as Ann Sebastian * Richard Taber as Pop Ware * John Alexander as Insp. Gordon * Peggy Dow as Kathy Hall * Alex Nicol as Dr. Steve Anderson Reception Film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed the film, \\"New York's famous Bellevue Hospital is the literal and alluring locale for a frankly fictitious mystery drama about internes and the smuggling of dope ... But beyond this pictorial asset, which is employed mainly for atmosphere, there is little about The Sleeping City to distinguish it from any thriller film ... for all its performance and direction by George Sherman in a tensile thriller style, The Sleeping City is just a mystery-chase film with a hospital as its locale. It is not the fine cosmopolitan drama of medical practice and human life that it had every chance to be.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, September 21, 1950.

He wrote, \\"Universal made The Sleeping City as its own contribution to the cycle, directed by George Sherman. The results weren't as stylistically striking as The Naked City, but had an appeal all its own -- the location shots had a more polished and slightly more visually lyrical look than those of The Naked City, and if the music by Frank Skinner (who'd scored part of the Dassin movie) wasn't as ornate as that of Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa (who scored the Dassin movie's finale), it helped sustain the tension set up by the script.\\"Eder, Bruce.

Gusikov and his instrument  Gusikow's 'wood and straw instrument', from Lewald's 'Europa' Gusikov was born to a family of klezmer musicians in Shklov (now in Belarus). Originally brought up to play the flute, like his father, a weakness of the lungs forced him to seek a different specialisation. In 1831 he constructed what he called a wood and straw instrument, essentially a xylophone laid out like a cimbalom on a soundboard made from rolls of straw which allowed a loud resonance. There is debate whether this instrument was invented by Gusikov himself, or by his contemporary Samson Jakubowski. On this instrument Gusikov developed an extraordinary virtuosity, and in 1834 gave concerts in Moscow, Kiev and Odessa.Conway (2011), 138-9 He was heard in a concert in Odessa by the Polish violinist Karol Lipinski, and with the support of Lipinski and the poet Lamartine undertook a concert tour of Western Europe, from 1835 onwards. The concerts, at which Gusikov appeared in traditional Jewish gabardine and was generally accompanied by his relatives on bass and violins, were an extraordinary success; in Paris he was so popular that a coiffure was named after him, imitating his payot.Conway (2011), 241 Gusikow played improvisations both on traditional Jewish and klezmer melodies and also on the popular opera tunes of the time. Other locations where he played included Prague, Frankfurt and Vienna.  Opinions of his music  Many professional Jewish musicians were highly impressed by Gusikov. Ferdinand Hiller wrote him a recommendation to Giacomo Meyerbeer. Felix Mendelssohn wrote to his family in 1836: 'I am curious to know whether Gusikow pleased you as much as he did me. He is quite a phenomenon; a famous fellow, inferior to no virtuoso in the world, both in execution and feeling; he therefore delights me more with his instrument of wood and straw than many with their pianofortes.'Mendelssohn (1883), 98-9 Franz Liszt, on the other hand, was more dismissive, calling Gusikov a 'Paganini of the Boulevards' whose 'gift, one might say his genius' would have been better applied to 'inventing an agricultural instrument' whereas his 'talent, being misguided, has produced nothing but musical inanities.' Gusikov attracted the admiration and friendship of the musicologist Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, who wrote a long article about him, based on their discussions in Brussels, in his musical dictionary. Death Exhausted by his tour, Gusikov died of tuberculosis in Aachen, his last days embittered by the alleged theft of his precious instrument from his lodgings. Only one piece of music written by Gusikov has survived, a setting of the Jewish hymn Shir Hama‚Äôalot (Psalm 126). Sources *The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians ed.

Etymology Windisch is situated at the site of the Roman legion camp Vindonissa. Originally a Celtic God, the name Vindos points to a widespread prehistorical cult of Vindos and the most likely origin of the Windisch place name. In 1064 the current municipality was mentioned as Vinse, and in 1175 as Vindisse. Until the 19th Century the official name was Windisch und Oberburg. History Location of the south gate of the Vindonissa camp Agnes of Hungary with K√∂nigsfelden Abbey Windisch grew into a regional power following the foundation of K√∂nigsfelden Abbey in 1309 in memory of the regicide of King Albert I of Germany in the previous year. Albert was on the way to suppress a revolt in Swabia when he was murdered on May 1, 1308, near Windisch on the Reuss, by his nephew John of Swabi, afterwards called \\"the Parricide\\" or \\"John Parricida\\", whom he had deprived of his inheritance. After the foundation of the Abbey, the village was placed under the authority of the Abbey. Starting in 1348 the rights to high and low justice were held by Agnes of Hungary, a daughter of Albert I. In 1411 those rights transferred back to the monastery. The abbey church, possibly in antiquity under the patronage of St. Martin but in the Middle Ages under the patronage of Mary, is built on the site of the 6th Century Bishop's church. The present building, with a late- Romanesque nave and Gothic choir, was built between 1310-30. The church's charnel house was rebuilt in 1793 into a schoolhouse. After the conquest of the Aargau by Bern and the introduction of the Reformation (1528) the monastery was suppressed. Until 1798 it served as the residence of the Bernese bailiffs (). People from Windisch worked in the bailiff's residence as servants, maids and workmen, while the poor came to the former abbey for alms. The main sources of income in Windisch included handicrafting, ferries, fisheries, shipping, tavern and iron ore mining in Lindhof, but agriculture was the major contributor. There was a ferry over the Reuss on the Bern-Zurich road. This was replace in 1799 by a bridge. Plague epidemics (in 1667 60% of the population died of the plague) and the restrictive immigration policies of the municipality prevented growth. However, during the 18th Century, the emergence of new occupations, led to a significant population increase. These new industries included cap and stocking weaving, and water powered light industry (including plaster and flour mills). At the same time improved agriculture techniques allowed more food to be produced from the fields. The nearest neighbor to Windisch was the town of Brugg. The close proximity led to centuries of conflicts over grazing rights, city monopolies, taxation and especially the location of the municipal boundary. In 1863, due to a border adjustment, Windisch lost to Brugg. In the 19th Century the economy of the village changed. In 1825 Henry Kunz founded the cotton mill Kunz which had 567 employees in 1846. They built factory workers' homes and a village school. In 1804 part of K√∂nigsfelden Abbey converted into a District Hospital. In 1872 a new building was built and since 1887 it has been a psychiatric clinic. The construction of the railway network transformed Brugg and Windisch into a railroad hub with a large depot and repair shop (primarily for steam locomotives). These innovations resulted in the influx of factory workers, nurses and trained staff. This led to a restructuring of the population: for example, the locally born and working population fell from 88% (1815), 55% (1837) and 21% (1900) to 4% (1970), while the proportion of Catholics rose from 9% (1850) to 45% (1970). Agriculture employs only 0.6% of the population (1990). In 1965, a Higher Technical School of Windisch (now a university) opened. The changing population structure led to political shifts in favor of the Social Democratic Party (SP) (1921-49 was known as the period of the \\"red Windisch\\"). With a pronounced emphasis on political independence, Windisch grew together structurally and economically with Brugg. Geography Windisch Windisch has an area, , of .

They constitute a comune of Italy's Province of Foggia and form part of the Gargano national park. The name of the islands relates to their seismic hazard, with a history of earthquakes in the area: tremiti means \\"tremors\\". The islands were used for the internment of political prisoners during Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. This was nothing new: two millennia earlier Augustus had exiled his granddaughter Julia the Younger to one of these islands (then named Trimerus in Latin, maybe from Greek Trimeros, Œ§œÅŒØŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ, meaning \\"three places\\" or \\"three islands\\"). The islands are now an important tourist attraction because of the clear waters surrounding them. Up to 100,000 visitors come to the islands in the summer season.Lonely Planet http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/isole-tremiti Ferry services from the mainland operate from Termoli, Vieste, Rodi Garganico and Capoiale, while Alidaunia offers flights from San Domino Heliport to Foggia and Vieste.  Islands  *San Domino is the most developed island for tourism and has the only sand beach in the archipelago. *San Nicola is where most of the population resides. It is the site of a monastery where a monk named Nicol√≤ was buried. Legend has it that every time someone tried to move his corpse off the island, a violent storm would break out, preventing navigation around the island. *Capraia (or Capperaia) is deserted. *Cretaccio is a large block of clay and thus uninhabited. *Pianosa is a small, uninhabited island. Its maximum elevation is . Sometimes, during storms, the waves cover it.  History  Inhabited since late Iron Age times (4th-3rd centuries BC), the Tremiti Islands have been a confinement place since ancient times. Roman emperor Augustus had his granddaughter Julia the Younger transferred here, where she died after 20 years. In the Middle Ages the archipelago was ruled by the Abbey of Santa Maria a Mare (\\"Holy Mary on the Sea\\") at San Nicola island, apparently founded here in the 9th century by Benedictine monks from Montecassino. In the 13th century the abbey had gained its autonomy from the father monastery, and owned lands from the Biferno to Trani on the Apulian mainland. After an alleged period of moral decadence, in 1237 the Benedictines were replaced by the Cistercian order. In 1334 the abbey was sacked by Dalmatian pirates from Omi≈°. In 1412 the Lateran Canons took ownership of the islands, and restored the abbey with cisterns and fortifications which withstood the assault of Ottoman ships in 1567. The abbey was suppressed in 1783 by King Ferdinand IV of Naples, who set up a penal colony. During the Napoleonic age the islands were a stronghold of Joachim Murat's supporters, who resisted a British fleet in 1809. In 1843, to repopulate the islands, King Ferdinand II of Two Sicilies moved a number of people from Naples' slums to the islands, who mostly became fishermen. In 1911, about 1,300 Libyans who had resisted Italian colonial rule were confined to Tremiti. After a year, around one-third of them had died, mainly from typhus.  1930s  During the Fascist era, the archipelago continued to perform its function of confinement, detaining, among others, Amerigo Dumini, and future president of the Republic, Sandro Pertini. Mussolini had hundreds of homosexuals deported to San Domino, in 1938. No law prohibited homosexuality at the time, and Mussolini also denied its existence, saying that, \\"In Italy there are only real men\\". However, suspected or reported homosexuals were rounded up and deported. The conditions on the island were very difficult, and a few died.World Fascism, a historical encyclopedia, volume 1. San Domino had the distinction of being the only internment camp in which all the prisoners were gay. Mussolini's regime had unwittingly created a part of Italy in which men were expected to be openly gay. The dormitories were spartan, with no electricity or running water.Johnston, Alan. (2013, June 12). A gay island community created by Italy's Fascists. BBC News: retrieved 6/13/2013. A bell would ring at 8 p.m. each day, signaling that the men were no longer allowed to be outside. For the remainder of the night they were locked in their dorm rooms, under police supervision. The internment camp closed in 1939, as Italy became enmeshed in the beginnings of World War II.  2000s  In May 2012 the provincial government caused a scandal by attempting to sell-off blocks of land on two of the islands for development for a reported ‚Ç¨4m.

It was released in September 1996, for the PC and Amiga computers. This was the last Championship Manager game to be released for the Amiga, the platform that the series started on. It is the only game in the series to have been developed by both Sports Interactive and the game's long-time publishers Eidos Interactive.  Gameplay  The game, a seasonal update (the first of many in the series), included more than just a modified player database. For the first time, the game included three playable league systems within the main game - England, Scotland and Italy. As well as the usual complement of bug fixes and tweaks to the game's AI, there were also rule changes to reflect real-life changes in the world of football, such as the full implementation of the Bosman ruling and the inclusion of five substitutes in the Premier League. The game also had a cheat in which if the player's name entered at the beginning of the game was the name of a national manager of the time (for instance - Glenn Hoddle for England) then the game would allow the player to take charge of that national team right from the start, as opposed to working up a good enough reputation to be offered the job as was supposed to be the case.  Creation of new players  The game replaced a player when it decided they were of retirement age. It had a database of first- and second-names, for each nationality, and would randomly come up with a combination of these to rename a new player, who replaced the old, retiring player. This data-base could be accessed and amended by the user, to allow for comical names to be introduced into the gameplay. Notable players who often retired at the end of the 1st or 2nd season were George Weah and Ruud Gullit, and the replacements for these would always have similar playing abilities, leading to some outstanding made-up players to be created.  Star players  Like all Championship Manager games, 96/97 would make some stars out of surprising players. Alan Fettis, who starts the game as the Nottingham Forest reserve goalkeeper was an outstanding player, available for only a few hundred thousand pounds early on in the game. Victor Leonenko of Dynamo Kiev would also prove an excellent player in the game, despite the real-life Leonenko being more of a reserve player due to the form of Sergei Rebrov and Andriy Shevchenko.

Usually, fish and chip shops provide takeaway service, although some have seating facilities. Variations on the name include fish bar, fisheries in Yorkshire, fish shop and chip shop. In the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland, they are colloquially known as a chippy or fishy, while in the rest of Ireland they are known as chippers. Fish and chip shops may also sell other foods, including variations on their core offering such as battered sausage and burgers, to regional cuisine such as Indian or Chinese food. Oldham - first chip shop in UK History A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market in England marks the 1860s origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries. In 1928, Harry Ramsden's fast food restaurant chain opened in the UK. On a single day in 1952, his fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire, served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning itself a place in the Guinness Book Of Records. Now the \\"corner fish-n-chip shop\\" has become staple throughout the western world, as well as making inroads into the middle- and far-east. Etymology The word \\"chip-shop\\" is first recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary in 1953. \\"Chippy\\" or \\"chippie\\" was first recorded in 1961. Occasionally the type of fish will be specified, as in 'Cod- n-Chips'. Operations Many British villages, suburbs, towns and cities have fish and chip shops, especially near coastal regions. Fish and chip outlets sell roughly 30% of all the white fish consumed in the United Kingdom, and use 10% of the UK potato crop. An Irish-Italian takeaway in Celbridge. In Ireland, many \\"chippers\\" are operated by Italian immigrant families, all native to the Province of Frosinone in Lazio. The Italian chip shop tradition began with Giuseppe Cervi, who took a boat to America in the 1880s but instead disembarked at Cobh, County Cork and walked to Dublin, establishing a takeaway at 22 Great Brunswick Street (modern Pearse Street). Regional differences In Scotland, the fish tends to be haddock, where in England it tends to be cod. This is because both fish tend to be sourced from Scottish waters in the North Sea, and then shipped around the UK. Haddock was thought to taste better than cod when fresh, while cod tasted better a few days later. In the days before refrigerated haulage this meant that haddock would taste bad by the time it made it out of Scotland, while the cod would still taste good if it took a few days to reach its destination. Hake, pollock, whiting, and plaice are also seen at many chip shops. In Scotland, 'special fish' is a variant where the haddock is breadcrumbed instead of battered. A number of fish and chip shop condiments exist, including salt and vinegar (very often actually non-brewed condiment) across the UK, mushy peas and curry sauce in various parts of the UK, chip spice in Hull, chippy sauce in Edinburgh, gravy in Derby, mushy pea and mint sauce in Nottingham, and gravy and cheese in Yorkshire. There are also variations with the oil used to cook the fish and chips. Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard, and are still used in the Midlands and the North; however, vegetable oils, such as palm oil, rapeseed or peanut oil (used because of its relatively high smoke point) now predominate, particularly in the South. There are also a number of other offerings at fish and chip shops that do not involve fish, such as the battered sausage. There are also regional variations across the UK including: * Pastie in Northern Ireland * Potato scallops in the West Midlands (a deep fried slice of potato) * Deep fried Mars bars in Scotland * Red pudding in Fife Scotland * Pukka Pies in England * Saveloy in London * Faggots in Coventry and the Black Country * Batter bits in Leeds and the North * Battered roe West Midlands * Orange Chips in the Black Country * Pizza Crunch in Glasgow * Pickled onion in the West Midlands and other parts of the UK * Battered white pudding in Scotland and Northern Ireland * Deep fried haggis as a supper across Scotland.

Also called the whistling eagle or whistling hawk, it is named for its loud whistling call, which it often gives in flight. Some authorities put this species in the genus Milvus, despite marked differences in behaviour, voice and plumage between this species and other members of that genus. Description Flying in Victoria, Australia The whistling kite ranges in size from , with a wingspan between . Weights range from an average of 600g-750g for males and 750g-1000g for females. As with most raptors, females are larger and heavier than males; though there is considerable overlap between the sexes, females can be up to 21% larger and 42% heavier. Southern birds are also larger than those found in the tropics. Male and female plumages are the same. Adult birds are a pale buff on the head, breast and tail, with browner wings and black flight feathers. Immature birds are a heavily streaked reddish-brown with prominent pale spots on the wings. Throughout their lives, whistling kites have bone-colored legs and feet, which are unfeathered. Overall, the whistling kite looks small-headed and long-tailed, with wingtips falling well short of the tail tip when the bird is perched. Though its legs are short, the bird walks easily on the ground. Whistling kites soar on slightly bowed wings, with their long flight feathers often well-splayed. The striking pattern on their underwings is distinctive. Voice This is a noisy species, calling regularly in flight and while perched--even while at the nest. Its most common call is a clear descending whistle, often followed (less often preceded) by a rapid series of rising notes. Intriguingly, field research carried out in Taunton Scientific National Park, Central Queensland by Fiona Randall from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland has shown that spotted bowerbirds (Chlamydera maculata) in that park regularly mimic the calls of whistling kites, with the frequency of mimicry increasing as the breeding season progresses. The function of this mimicry is unknown. Habitat A species of open or lightly wooded areas, whistling kites are typically found near water, at elevations ranging from sea level to 1400 meters. Though the species as a whole is generally sedentary, some Australian birds are known to be nomadic, wandering to coastal areas in northern Australia during the dry season; some south Australian birds migrate to the south in the autumn. There is some evidence that the species is declining locally in southern Australia due to the drainage of wetlands and an accompanying decline in food supplies. Behaviour Whistling kites tend to be found singly or in pairs, but sometimes gather in larger groups, particularly during nomadic movements, at roost sites and at sources of plentiful food. Feeding right Whistling kites are truly catholic in their tastes, taking small mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, insects and carrion. Those in Australia tend to take primarily live prey (except in the winter, when they subsist largely on carrion), while those in New Guinea are principally scavengers. Most food items are taken either from the ground or from the water surface, though insects are sometimes hawked directly from the air. Whistling kites are also known to pirate meals from ibises and herons and from other raptors, and to force large waterbirds to regurgitate their catches. They regularly patrol roads in search of roadkill, and hover over the edges of grass fires in search of potential prey fleeing the flames. When food is scarce they will almost entirely rely on finding carrion. Breeding The whistling kite's nest is a bulky platform made of sticks and lined with green leaves, placed in an upright fork of a tall tree--often a eucalypt or pine in a riparian area. Pairs often re-use the same nest year after year, annually adding material until the platform becomes quite large. Females normally lay 2-3 bluish-white eggs, which are sometimes covered with reddish-brown blotches; clutches of 1-4 eggs have been recorded. Eggs are incubated for 35-40 days, and the species is reported to have a 60% hatching success. Chicks, which are covered with cream- or buff-colored down feathers, spend 44-54 days in the nest before fledging, and are dependent on their parents for a further 6-8 weeks after leaving the nest. In Australia, the birds generally breed between June and October in the south, and between February and May in the north, though they may nest at any time after rain providing there are adequate food supplies.

In 2002 they were indicted in Houston, Texas on seven counts of wire fraud against their former employer Greenwich NatWest, at the time a division of National Westminster Bank, as part of the Enron scandal. After a high-profile battle in the British courts they were extradited from the United Kingdom to the United States in 2006. On 28 November 2007, each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in exchange for the other charges being dropped. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. Initially they were jailed in the US, but were later repatriated to UK prisons to serve out the rest of their sentences and released from custody in August 2010. Background In 2000 the three worked for Greenwich NatWest, then a unit of National Westminster Bank, later acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The three were involved in Greenwich NatWest's dealings with Enron Corporation. As a result of these dealings NatWest owned a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered partnership called Swap Sub.Statement of Facts, section 8. Swap Sub was a special purpose entity created by Andrew Fastow, Enron's CFO, ostensibly for the purpose of hedging Enron's investment in Rhythms NetConnections, an internet service provider. Swap Sub's assets consisted of cash and Enron stock. Its liability was an option giving Enron the ability to require it to buy Enron's entire investment in Rhythms NetConnections at a predetermined price in 2004.Fox, pp. 152‚Äì53 In addition to NatWest, Credit Suisse First Boston held an equal stake in Swap Sub. The remainder was owned by a partnership managed by Fastow. In March 2000, Enron decided to terminate the hedging arrangement with Swap Sub. Fastow managed to persuade Enron to pay Swap Sub a $30 million fee to terminate the option and recover the Enron stock it owned,Fox, p. 159 even though, because of a decline in the price of the Rhythms stock, \\"Swap Sub owed Enron a ton of money\\". $10 million of the payment went to Credit Suisse First Boston; Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the other $20 million would go to NatWest, but in fact only $1 million did so. The payment, which was formally agreed on 22 March 2000, resulted in large profits for Swap Sub, enriching several Enron employees who had acquired ownership interests in the partnership.Fox (2004), pp. 159‚Äì60 The crime According to the Statement of Facts which was signed by all three defendants as part of their eventual plea bargain, the Three realized in early 2000 that, because of rises in the stock prices of Enron and Rhythms, NatWest's interest in Swap Sub \\"had quite some value\\".Statement of Facts, section 16 On 22 February of that year, the three bankers made a presentation to Enron CFO Andrew Fastow suggesting ways in which this value could be captured; however, Fastow ultimately rejected this proposal.Statement of Facts, section 19. Shortly afterwards, Fastow contacted Gary Mulgrew in late February or early March 2000 and offered to purchase NatWest's interest in Swap Sub.Statement of Facts, section 20 He also offered Mulgrew what is described in the Statement of Facts as \\"an unspecified financial opportunity\\" if he were to leave NatWest. Mulgrew discussed this conversation with Darby and Bermingham. On 6 March 2000, Fastow's assistant Michael Kopper contacted Darby with a formal proposal that a company Kopper controlled should purchase NatWest's stake in Swap Sub for $1 million.Statement of Facts, section 21. Mulgrew and Darby subsequently recommended to their superiors that NatWest should accept this offer.Statement of Facts, section 22. Later that month, the three bankers learned that the \\"unspecified financial opportunity\\" which had been mentioned to Mulgrew involved their personally acquiring a portion of NatWest's stake in Swap Sub.Statement of Facts, section 23 In furtherance of this, Kopper set up a deal for the Three to acquire a put option on half of NatWest's former stake in the company. On 17 March, Darby collected the signatures needed to finalize the NatWest sale.Statement of Facts, section 26. On 20 March the Three executed the option agreement with Kopper.Statement of Facts, section 27. The Three concealed both their dealings with Fastow and Kopper, and the fact that they now had a financial interest in the company that bought Swap Sub, from their superiors at NatWest.Statement of Facts, section 28. According to the Statement of Facts, the Three were unaware of the 22 March agreement to pay $30 million to Swap Sub.Statement of Facts, section 29 On 21 April 2000, Bermingham, who had resigned from NatWest in the meantime, exercised the options, resulting in a profit of more than $7 million.Statement of Facts, section 31 He subsequently split the proceeds with Darby and Mulgrew.Statement of Facts, section 33. Timeline of legal proceedings=FSA investigation In November 2001 the three bankers, having now moved to work at Royal Bank of Canada, learned that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating Fastow and voluntarily met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) to discuss the deal. According to their own account, the Three initiated this meeting in order to \\"ensure transparency\\". Bermingham later claimed that \\"[w]e gave [the FSA] everything because we thought we had nothing to hide.\\" In February 2002 the FSA completed its inquiries without taking any action. It later emerged that the FSA had passed the results of its investigation to the SEC, which had in turn passed them on to the prosecutors in the US Department of Justice. According to a report in The Times the FSA report was so detailed that it told the SEC whom to interview and what evidence would be needed to secure a conviction, and concluded that \\"there appears to be evidence that the three individuals were subject to a major conflict of interest\\". Issue of arrest warrants and indictment US arrest warrants for the Three were issued in June 2002. They were indicted by a grand jury in Houston, Texas in September of the same year on seven counts of wire fraud.Indictment: United States of America v. David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, usdoj.gov; accessed 16 November 2015. The warrants were among the first issued by Enron prosecutors; media reports speculated that their main purpose was to induce the Three into a plea bargain whereby they would testify against Kopper and Fastow (seen as more important prosecution targets) in exchange for reduced sentences. During the long delay caused by the decision of the Three to fight extradition, however, Kopper and Fastow both pleaded guilty and entered into plea bargains themselves. Thus, in an ironic turn of events, Kopper and Fastow were likely to have been the key prosecution witnesses against the Three if the case had gone to trial. The indictment set out seven counts of wire fraud, each one corresponding to a document (fax, email or wire transfer) that was transmitted electronically in the United States in furtherance of the alleged fraudulent scheme. In addition to the facts agreed to as part of the eventual plea bargain, the indictment alleged that the Three knew, at the time they recommended the sale of Swap Sub to NatWest, that its value was significantly greater than $1 million, and that the 22 February presentation to Fastow was part of the fraudulent scheme. Although Enron officials were involved, the indictment did not allege that Enron Corporation itself was a victim of the scheme, or that the Three's activities had any connection to Enron's collapse. The evidence against the NatWest Three included preparations for the 22 February presentation, which contained the phrase > Problem is that it is too obvious (to both Enron and LPs) what is happening > (ie, robbery of LPs), so probably not attractive. Also no certainty of > making money ... Prosecutors alleged that the use of the word \\"robbery\\" in the presentation showed that the Three knew that they were planning to commit a crime. They also cited the discrepancy between the amounts of money accepted by NatWest ($1 million) and Credit Suisse First Boston ($10 million) for their equal stakes in Swap Sub. Extradition to the United States US prosecutors began to pursue proceedings in what they expected to be a \\"routine\\" extradition in the summer of 2002. The Three were arrested in Britain on 23 April 2004. Extradition proceedings under the Extradition Act 2003 commenced in June of that year amid widespread controversy.Brits arrested in Enron case awaiting extradition hearing Houston Chronicle, 10 June 2004. In September 2004 a judge at Bow Street Magistrates' Court ruled that the extradition could proceed. The Three responded by suing Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the High Court of Justice, seeking judicial review to force a prosecution in the UK which would have taken precedence over the US investigation. In response the SFO issued a statement defending its decision to defer to prosecutors in the US: After a significant delay, the extradition was endorsed by Home Secretary Charles Clarke in May 2005. The Three appealed this decision also in the High Court. On 20 February 2006 both the appeal against extradition and the suit to force the SFO to prosecute (which were consolidated into one case) were rejected by the High Court. The bankers appealed further to the House of Lords, but this appeal failed on 21 June 2006. On 27 June 2006 the Three lost an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. Rumours in the UK press that the British government would support the Three's case were rejected by Attorney General Lord Goldsmith on 7 July 2006. Initial court proceedings in the United States After all legal avenues of appeal against extradition had been exhausted, the Three arrived in Houston on 13 July 2006. They spent one night in that city's Federal Detention Center before being released into the custody of their attorney, under a requirement that they wear electronic monitoring devices. On 21 July, a judge ruled that the Three could go free on bond but could not leave the Houston area, could not meet with each other without their lawyers present, and were required to raise between $80,000 and $150,000 by the end of the month.\\"Judge: Brits in Enron case must stay put\\", Houston Chronicle, 21 July 2006 US immigration services gave them permission to accept employment in the US for a period of one year, but, because of the judge's order, they were not permitted to leave the Houston area to seek or obtain work.\\"Judge limits travel of British Enron bankers\\", Houston Chronicle, 22 July 2006. Trial date postponements On 2 August 2006 the trial date was delayed indefinitely from 13 September 2006, in order to allow two of the Three to secure legal representation.Former bankers win delay in trial, Houston Chronicle, 2 August 2006 On 9 August 2006 the legal situation of the Three was complicated by subpoenas served on them in an Enron-related civil suit against Royal Bank of Canada.Enron investors call NatWest Three in civil lawsuit, The Guardian, 9 August 2006 On 12 August 2006 all three informed the judge that they had retained attorneys.Ex-bankers from Britain retain lawyers, Houston Chronicle, 12 August 2006 On 6 September 2006, the trial date was set for February 2007 if witnesses could be obtained in time, failing that for 4 September 2007. Until that time the Three were required to wear monitoring devices and were forbidden from leaving the Houston area.Trial set for next September in Enron-related case, Houston Chronicle, 6 September 2006 On 1 August 2007, the trial date was moved back yet again to January 2008. This was following another earlier postponement to 22 October. This further delay was a significant blow to the three, and their supporters stressed again the problems they were facing with the scale of legal fees and further separation from their families in the UK.Natwest Three devastated at new trial delay,The Times,2 August 2007. Witnesses controversy On 6 August 2007, the Three asked the judge in the case to order six former colleagues living in Britain to provide video testimony for their defence. In a court filing explaining this request, they alleged that \\"[s]everal individuals now refuse to travel to the United States to appear on defendants' behalf because they feel, or have been, threatened by the [US] government\\". Such a request would have required the co-operation of British authorities. The Three's filing also claimed that Royal Bank of Scotland was obstructing attempts to contact a larger group of thirty-six employees who were also potential witnesses, claiming that \\"[t]he Royal Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Canada have‚Ä¶ taken steps to prevent Defendants from securing the testimony of former colleagues\\", and that \\"counsel for the purported victim in this case [RBS] has interfered with the ability of defence counsel to obtain relevant testimony\\". They concluded that the Three's ability \\"to mount a vigorous defence has thereby been severely compromised, if not eviscerated\\". The Three went so far as to publicly name the prospective witnesses in the hope that that would encourage some of them to speak out. Plea bargain On 28 November 2007, the Three accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop the other six counts, and to support the application by the Three to serve part of their sentences in the United Kingdom. In the plea agreement, the Three pleaded guilty to count four of the indictment, relating to the email from London to Houston of the final Swap Sub sale documents. A \\"statement of facts\\" was appended to the plea agreement as Exhibit A and was signed by all three defendants. Prosecutor Alice Fisher stated, \\"[t]hese three defendants admitted today that they defrauded NatWest by entering into a secret and illegal deal with officers from Enron ‚Äì a deal that yielded millions in profits for them personally at the expense of their employer\\". However, an article in The Daily Telegraph argued that the guilty pleas were motivated not by actual guilt, but rather by the prospect of further delays before the trial and possible 35-year sentences if convicted. Other British commentators agreed that this was a possibility. The Telegraph piece went on to claim that the statement of facts did not state that the Three knowingly defrauded NatWest. The original indictment alleged that the Three knew that NatWest's stake was worth far more than the $1 million it was being sold for; the statement of facts claimed only that bankers believed it was likely that they would make significant amounts of money as a result of the transaction, based on information that they concealed from their employer. In August 2010 Bermingham and Mulgrew appeared in a video on ungagged.net, a site devoted to attacking the US Department of Justice's handling of the Enron collapse. In the video David Bermingham recanted his guilty plea, and both he and Mulgrew claimed that they had been pressured into accepting plea bargains, attacking the US judicial system and characterising their treatment as \\"torture\\".\\"NAT West banker claims he was 'tortured' into pleading guilty\\", Daily Telegraph, 15 August 2010. Giles Darby said that he \\"fundamentally\\" disagreed with the claims made by Bermingham and Mulgrew in the video.\\"Giles Darby fundamentally disagrees with 'torture' outburst by David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew\\", Daily Telegraph, 17 August 2010. Sentencing and prison The NatWest Three were sentenced on 22 February 2008 to 37 months of imprisonment. They were given no remission for the time they had spent in the United States awaiting trial. They were also required to repay $7.3 million to Royal Bank of Scotland, the successor bank to Greenwich NatWest, of which $1.25 million would be due when the men surrendered themselves to prison authorities. During sentencing, the Three each made brief statements to the judge. Mulgrew said that he had shown a \\"lack of integrity\\" and \\"exercised poor judgement\\", concluding that \\"I have no one to blame but myself\\". Darby admitted that he was \\"wrong\\", and said \\"I deeply regret my involvement in this whole affair.\\" Darby's lawyer stated that \\"Andy Fastow and the culture of greed at Enron corrupted everybody and everything it came in contact with\\", and added that the Three \\"are as much victims as anybody else.\\" The Three requested to be assigned to the low- security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. In April 2008, each was assigned to a different prison: Mulgrew was ordered to surrender to the facility in Big Spring, Texas on 30 April; Giles Darby to the Allenwood facility on 7 May; and David Bermingham to the prison in Lompoc, California, on 9 May. Mulgrew, Darby and Bermingham were assigned consecutive federal inmate numbers (66096-179, 66097-179 and 66098-179 respectively). They were later allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence in England. Bermingham was moved from Spring Hill Open Prison to a closed prison in Grendon Underwood in August 2009. The three were released in August 2010. Public relations campaign in Britain Press coverage of the Three in Britain was initially mostly negative, focusing on the amount of money the men had gained and their extravagant lifestyles. For example, The Independent wrote that the men saw themselves as \\"womanising buccanneers who played as hard and as fast as they pursued their deals\\", and The Sunday Times described Mulgrew as \\"fiercely competitive\\" with \\"a massive ego\\" and \\"scars on his arms\\" from his former career as a nightclub bouncer. The tone of the reporting changed when the Three secured the services of Bell Yard Communications, a public relations firm which specialised in \\"public reputation management during times of corporate crisis or dispute\\", headed by Melanie Riley. Adrian Flook of M: Communications was also involved. Both firms claimed to be working pro bono. Riley said that \\"I have been working pro bono for the last six months because I believe in the case. We have worked hard to ensure that people understood the inequity of the Extradition Act.\\" Guardian journalist Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News, described the strategy adopted by Bell Yard: Davies later recounted the reaction of the press: Riley summed up her strategy as follows: M: Communications co-founder Nick Miles added: An article in the Financial Times also highlighted the achievements of the public relations team: The Three feature as victims of British justice in the ¬£500,000 documentary Taking Liberties, made by Bermingham's film finance acquaintance.Taking Liberties, bbc.co.uk; accessed 16 November 2015. Extradition controversy The extensive news coverage of the Three in Britain resulted in a large-scale debate over the merits of their extradition to the United States under the then new Extradition Act 2003. In particular, a high-profile campaign against the extradition was led by The Daily Telegraph newspaper. Several arguments were raised against the extradition. Jurisdiction argument It was argued that the crime was committed by British citizens living in Britain against a British company based in London, the nation's capital city and that, therefore, any resulting criminal case fell under British legal and territorial jurisdictionRandall, Jeff \\"NatWest Three caught on extradition's one-way street\\", The Daily Telegraph, 1 March 2006. and should be tried by a British court.\\"Try Natwest three in UK ‚Äì Tories\\", BBC News, 6 July 2006. However, British authorities decided not to prosecute due to a purported lack of evidence.\\"Enron charge trio facing US trial\\", BBC News, 24 May 2005. Fair trial argument Some argued that it would be very difficult for Three to receive a fair trial in Texas. The case could have taken years to come to trial. The trial was scheduled to begin in September 2006, but was repeatedly postponed to January 2008. The three accused men would be forced to remain in the US, far away from their families in the UK. Additionally, while on bail they would be unable to find gainful employment in order to fund a legal defence against the charges brought against them. (The Three were permitted to seek employment in the US provided they remained in Houston.) It was also claimed that the defendants would be handicapped in preparing a defence because most of the evidence and witnesses were overseas in the UK. They argued that witnesses would be reluctant to come to Texas. Extradition inequality argument It was alleged that the extradition arrangements between the US and the UK were highly unequal. The Act's terms made it easier to extradite British citizens to America than vice versa. There has been much criticism of the fact that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case to extradite UK citizens, whereas there was no comparable facility to extradite US citizens to the UK. Despite this, the head of Britain's Serious Fraud Office, Robert Wardle, has claimed that there would have been enough evidence to extradite the Three to the US even under the old extradition arrangements. He expressed astonishment that the men had become a \\"cause c√©l√®bre\\", and expressed confidence that the Three would get a fair trial in the US. Supporters of the Three claim that when the extradition law was passed in the wake of 11 September the UK government stated that it was only to be used in the so-called war against terror and if the treaty was ratified by the US. However, neither of these conditions was written into the text of the extradition law, and neither had been fulfilled in the case of the Three at the time of their extradition. (The treaty was subsequently ratified by the US in September 2006.) House of Commons debate The Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, allowed an emergency debate, on 12 July 2006, on both the treaty and the 'Natwest Three' after a request by Liberal Democrat MP Nick Clegg. Neil Coulbeck On 12 July 2006, a former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) executive and FBI prosecution witness Neil Coulbeck had been found dead, after committing suicide by slitting his wrists. Coulbeck had worked for RBS until 2004, latterly as Head of Group Treasury. It had been suggested by friends and family that the FBI 'hounded' Coulbeck. At the inquest into his death, Coulbeck's wife stated that he had been deeply disturbed by the extradition of the Three, and it was known that he had provided a crucial statement which in part led to their extradition. The FBI denied this, saying that it had interviewed Coulbeck only once, four years earlier. Relevance in future extradition cases The case of the NatWest Three was cited in Parliament in relation to the 2020 US extradition request for Mike Lynch, founder of software company Autonomy. David Davis stated: Publications * ** Comments on the attempt by the US to extradite Autonomy founder Mike Lynch: \\"[i]t is a near statistical certainty that someone extradited to the US will end up guilty, most probably through a plea bargain rather than going to trial, because the criminal justice system in the US is so heavily geared towards this outcome\\". * ** \\"[A]longside the horror stories about gang beatings and brutality, Giles also wrote about the larger-than-life characters he met and the unexpected antics of his fellow inmates.\\" * ** \\"The remarkable true story of one man‚Äôs journey from a Glasgow orphanage to a notorious gang-infested prison in Texas.

She is best known for her photographs during the Iranian Revolution.  Biography  She spent her school years in Gorgan and then graduated from University of Tehran in the School of Law & Political Sciences. Beginning her photography career in 1970, she was awarded with the first prize of the ministry of art and culture's national photography competition. In 1972 she joined Iranian national TV-Radio as a photographer and later by initial publications of ‚ÄúTamasha‚Äù magazine, she became Iranian Television and Tamasha magazine's public relations photographer. Maryam Zandi remained with National Television for the next twelve years. Within this time she also began capturing photos of the revolution in 1979 as well as many other photographic experiences. Her first significant photography project (‚ÄúChehreh-ha: Portraits‚Äù) was formed within these years after revolution (1981) which by the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war and her trip to France (1986‚Äì1989) remains incomplete. However her first photography book (‚ÄúTurkmen & Sahra‚Äù: Turkmen & Desert) was published in 1982. This is the first collection portraying Turkmens of Iran and also the first collection which by the means of photographs intends to study and explore one of the Iranian ethnic groups. Her university thesis is also a sociological research about Turkmens of Iran. After returning to Iran in 1989, work on the incomplete project (‚ÄúChehreh-ha‚Äù: Portraits) is resumed. This work is still ongoing and after 26 years a unique extensive photography archive of famous and influential contemporary Iranian elites (as well as some non-Iranians) in the fields of literature, visual arts, cinema, theatre, architecture, music and politics is shaped. Maryam Zandi has published more than ten photography books until now. Her last publication is the ‚Äú1979 Revolution‚Äù photography book which is a collection of incidents happening around the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979. Since 2000 Maryam Zandi's photographs in collaboration with ‚ÄúEbrahim Haghighi‚Äù (Graphic designer) have designed and published more than 80 different types of artistic calendars. Most of these calendars are the first of their kind containing various photographs related to Iran. By publishing these calendars, Maryam Zandi has taken a huge influential step in improving the imagery culture and photographic taste of the Iranian people by taking these diverse range of photographs from every corner of the country to people's household. In 2005 Maryam Zandi along with twelve other famous and influential Iranian photographers were selected by the ‚ÄúSociety of Iranian Photographers‚Äù to establish the ‚ÄúNational Iranian Photographers‚Äô Society (NIPS)‚Äù. In 2009 by the first meeting of the board of directors, Maryam Zandi ‚Äìachieving the highest vote‚Äì was elected as the first chairman of the board. She resigned from NIPS in 2013. In 2010 she was invited to receive the ‚Äúfirst degree medal of art‚Äù from the president, however she refused the medal in protest to lack of freedom and professional dignity of photographers in Iran at the time. Same year, she received an independent award as the most influential photographer of the year in the ‚ÄúSocial Documentary Photography Festival‚Äù for supporting the rights of Iranian photographers (‚ÄúSheed Award‚Äù). In 2014 she won the same prize again, for publishing the book ‚Äú1979 Revolution‚Äù. Maryam Zandi has also been active in designing and making glass-works.

The series takes place on Phaze and Proton, two worlds occupying the same space in two different dimensional planes. Phaze is a lush planet of magic, where Proton is a barren mining planet of science. As the series opens, each person born on Phaze and Proton has an alternate self living on the other world. But if a person on either world lacks a duplicate (for instance if a Proton citizen immigrated there from another planet, or a counterpart from the opposite frame died), he can cross to the other through an energy \\"curtain\\" that circumscribes each frame. The first three books in the series follow Proton serf Stile as he enters Phaze and becomes an important political force there. The next three concern the adventures of Mach (Citizen Blue's son), Bane (Stile's son), and Bane's companions. Finally, volume 7, Phaze Doubt follows Bane's and Mach's nine- year-old children, Flach and Nepe, among others. Setting=Proton In the series, Proton is only one planet in a galaxy of human-inhabited worlds. Most of the atmosphere of the planet has been destroyed through the mining of Protonite, a valuable energy source, and the inhabitants of Proton live in domed cities with artificial life support. Despite its advanced science, Proton's socioeconomic scheme somewhat resembles the medieval period. The planet is run by fabulously wealthy Citizens but the bulk of the inhabitants are serfs. Serfs must be employed by a Citizen and remain naked at all times unless ordered otherwise by a Citizen. A Citizen has complete authority over his serfs and may order them to do anything he desires. The weakest among them have wealth to rival medieval kings. Serfs, however, are not slaves; the serfs of Proton have all chosen serfdom as their occupation (or are descended from those who have). After twenty years of work, a serf earns a gram of Protonite, and his retirement. While a paltry sum on Proton itself, this is enough to make the former serf comfortably wealthy elsewhere in the galaxy. Even then many serfs would choose to stay on Proton after their twenty years are up, but it is not permitted in most circumstances. The exception to this rule is getting far enough in the tourney (see below). In addition to the Citizens and serfs, Proton is home to advanced robots, some of which are self-aware and possess their own free will. As the series opens it is not common knowledge that some robots are self-willed. Humanity has also made contact with alien species, some members of which make their homes on Proton as well. The Game The main pastime of Proton inhabitants is The Game. When two persons want to play a round, they proceed to a Game console. There, one player chooses one of four categories: 1. PHYSICAL, 2. MENTAL, 3. CHANCE, or 4. ARTS. The other player chooses among A. NAKED, B. TOOL, C. MACHINE, or D. ANIMAL. (In this context, naked does not necessarily mean unclothed but rather unassisted by external tools.) Once the grid is completed, players continue on subgrids until they select a particular game to play. For instance, in the books, Stile plays a Naked/Arts round in interpretive dance, while later on the same category produces extemporaneous poetry. Chance/Tool covers board and card games, among others. Most sports are under Physical, but so is Tiddlywinks. Due to the wide variety of contests available, any given round could take any one of thousands of forms. In choosing categories for the Game and then particular contests once the main category is selected, the intelligent player uses his knowledge of his opponent, trying to play to the opponent's weaknesses and his own strengths. Of course, his ability to do so is limited because half the grid is in the opponent's hands. Every year, the top-ranked players are entered into a Tourney. The final winner of the Tourney is immediately made a Citizen and given a small percentage of the annual Protonite production equal to about one kilogram at the moment of Citizenship. (Assuming, of course, that the winner is not a Citizen already.) Other Tourney participants who last until the final rounds are rewarded by being allowed to stay a serf on Proton for an additional term of years. Not only do Citizens participate in the Game, they also wager vast sums amongst themselves in any conceivable fashion. However, should a Citizen lose so many wagers that he is unable to pay his debts with his proceeds from the Protonite mines, he is prevented from wagering further until once again solvent. Phaze In contrast to Proton, Phaze is a lush and verdant world. Besides humans, it is also populated by several species common to the fantasy genre such as unicorns, werewolves, vampires, trolls, and animalheads‚Äîhumans with beast- heads like the Minotaur or Anubis. As in classic fantasy fiction, magic is a daily part of life in Phaze. It is powered by Phazite, the same substance as Protonite on the other side of the curtain. Just as magic does not work in Proton, advanced technology does not operate in Phaze. For instance, when one of Proton's self-willed robots crossed the curtain into Phaze, she became inert until returned to her home dimension. Later, the same robot was magically made into a golem, allowing her to operate in both worlds, using electrical power in Proton, and magical power in Phaze. Most humans in Phaze are able to do some minor magic but are not magicians by trade. The exceptions are the Adepts, extremely powerful wizards, each with his or her own special mode of magic use. Most of the Adepts in Phaze are named after colors; for instance, the Brown Adept makes and animates golems while the White Adept performs magic by drawing sigils in the ground. Not only are Adepts able to achieve almost anything through their magic, only they are powerful enough to magically affect resistant creatures such as unicorns and animalheads. As a rule, Adepts cannot harm or otherwise affect another Adept through magic for very long; however, a group of them working in concert can usually overpower a lone Adept. Each spell an Adept uses can only be worked once by that Adept, though countless variations can be created. Humans are different from other species because they do not have the capability to do magic on their own and require phazite. Unicorns in the Apprentice Adept series are somewhat different from those traditionally described in fantasy. First, Phaze's unicorns are as intelligent as humans. Also, they are not colored in blacks and greys like horses but rather in more dramatic colors. For instance, one unicorn character, Clip, is a blue stallion with red \\"socks,\\" that is, ankles. In addition to their coloring, unicorns with socks can actually remove them. If humans don them, the socks cast the illusion that the human is in fact a unicorn of the sock color. Furthermore, unicorns in Phaze are shapeshifters; most can learn two other forms. If a unicorn learns to shift into a hawk, he can fly in that form; if a human, he can speak. Finally, unicorns in the series have hollow horns which they use as musical instruments. Each unicorn character described in the books has a distinct instrument. For instance, Clip's horn sounds like a saxophone, while his sister Neysa's horn makes harmonica sounds. One final, important feature of Phaze is the Oracle. Although the actual Oracle is hidden from sight for reasons explained later in the series, it is accessible through a speaking tube. The Oracle will answer any querent a single question. But like the original Oracle at Delphi, the pronouncements of Phaze's Oracle are usually cryptic and self-fulfilling. The Oracle is actually a computer with its source line running through the west pole so it can have power in Phaze.  Adepts  As referenced before, most of the adepts in Phaze are named after colors and each has a unique mode of magic. The Adepts and their powers: #Blue Adept: Blue uses music and rhymes. More specifically, music summons his magic and words define it. #Yellow Adept: Yellow uses potions. #Red Adept: Red stores magic in amulets that must then be invoked. Trool the Troll was made Red adept by use of the book of magic. #White Adept: White draws sigils. The surface doesn't matter. #Black Adept: Black's power is a line of seeming unlimited length that can be used to create physical objects such as a castle or a dragon. #Green Adept: Green's magic is invoked through hand gestures. #Orange Adept: Orange has power over all plant life. #Purple Adept: Purple's magic involves geological manipulation (e.g., creating tunnels or earthquakes). #Brown Adept: Brown has the power to make and animate golems. #Translucent Adept: Translucent has mysterious powers over water and aquatic creatures. #Tan Adept: Tan's power is called \\"The Evil Eye.\\" Tan can use this power to slice, stun, mesmerize, or presumably kill. #Clef: Clef never had a color. He was the one chosen, for his natural skills with musical instruments, to play the \\"platinum flute\\" to juxtapose the frames of Phaze and Proton. His only ability to manifest magic actually lies within the flute itself. He was not actually considered an \\"Adept,\\" because his powers are not inherent. But his ability to wield the flute's powers gave him Adept- like magnitude during his brief tenure in Phaze. #Robot Adept: This title officially belongs to Mach, the son of Citizen Blue and Sheen. He used the Book of Magic to become an instant Adept. However, in Juxtaposition, Sheen is also referred to as the Robot Adept. She also had to use the Book of Magic and as a result became Adept. #Unicorn Adept: This is the son of Mach and Fleta, Flach. He has the power of the blue adept and the power to shape shift like a unicorn. #Hectare Adept: An alien named Weva. She is part wolf, bat, and human. Her Proton aspect, Beman, is part Hectare(BEM), robot, and human. He/She was born under the West Pole of Phaze, and trained by the Animal-heads that lived there. There is an assumption, although it is never stated, that she was trained from the Book of Magic and therefore isn't limited in her mode of magic. Note: Due to the use of the Book of Magic, which contains all forms of Adept magic, Robot and Unicorn and Red Adept 2 are not limited in the method in which they invoke their magic. Series synopsis=Split Infinity (1980) The Game-champion serf Stile is assaulted on Proton by an unknown enemy, but learns he can escape into a mysterious fantasy world (Phaze). In Phaze he meets Neysa, a unicorn, and learns of his magical legacy as the Blue Adept. Back in Proton he tries to uncover his enemy, while building a relationship with his robot lover, Sheen. Blue Adept (1981) Stile has gained significant power in Phaze as the Blue adept, whose songs and poems hold incredible power. However, on Proton he faces deportation and enters the tournament in the hope of gaining citizenship. His adversary is revealed to be the amulet-making Red Adept, who exists in Proton as a serf in the Tourney. Stile defeats her in combat in Phaze and in the Tourney on Proton, leading to her expulsion from both worlds.  Juxtaposition (1982) Years of mining for the high-energy mineral \\"Protonite\\" has left an imbalance between Proton and its sister world, Phaze. To restore the balance, Citizen/Adept Stile must juxtapose the frames and transfer \\"Phazeite\\" from Phaze to Proton, or the two worlds will both be destroyed. However, he faces resistance from the Contrary Citizens and Adverse Adepts who stand to lose considerable power if he is successful. Out of Phaze (1987) Out of Phaze is about the early adventures of Mach and Bane. Mach is the robotic son of the original Blue Adept/Sheen from Proton and Bane the son of Stile/Lady Blue from Phaze. The two discover that they have the ability to switch frames, but have difficulty switching back. Both fall in love with people from the other frame: Mach with Fleta, the daughter of Neysa the unicorn, and Bane with Agape, an amorphous alien. Robot Adept (1988) Conflict arises between Mach and Bane due to their individual honors. Mach allies himself with the Adverse Adepts/Contrary Citizens due to the denial of his \\"forbidden relationship\\" with Fleta in Out of Phaze. Mach learns magic from the book of magic to become the robot adept. In the end, Mach and Bane have a contest across the frames, and Mach wins, putting both Mach and Bane on the side of the Adverse Adepts/Contrary Citizens. Unicorn Point (1989) This book chronicles the adventures of the children of Mach/Fleta (Flach) and Bane/Agape (Nepe). Each has powers derived from both their parents. Phaze Doubt (1990) The bug-eyed monsters (BEMs) attempt to take over Phaze. Lysander, an alien mind in a human body, is sent to infiltrate the Phaze/Proton resistance but finds that a prophecy makes him the key player in the planet's defence, though his loyalty remains with the BEMs. The realm of Phaze is also briefly visited in Piers Anthony's twenty-seventh Xanth book, Cube Route.
