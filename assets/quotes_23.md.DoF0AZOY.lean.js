It is the operation in which the organisms within a specified ecosystem use the process of respiration to convert organic carbon to carbon dioxide. While the amount of respiration is varied upon the type of ecosystem and the community abundance, the mechanism occurs in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Ecosystem respiration is typically measured in the natural environment, such as a forest or grassland, rather than in the laboratory. Ecosystem respiration is the production portion of carbon dioxide in an ecosystem's carbon flux, while photosynthesis typically accounts for the majority of the ecosystem's carbon consumption.  Overview  Ecosystem respiration happens when a cell takes glucose and oxygen and uses it to produce carbon dioxide, energy, and water. This transaction is important not only for the benefit of the cells, but for the carbon dioxide output provided, which is key in the process of photosynthesis. Without respiration, actions necessary to life, such as metabolic processes and photosynthesis, would cease.

He won the 2009 International Dublin Literary Award for his debut novel Man Gone Down, receiving a prize of €100,000. Man Gone Down is also recommended by The New York Times. Early and personal life Thomas was born and raised in Boston. He studied for a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in New York City, where he now teaches, and for a master's at Warren Wilson College. He currently lives in New York City, claiming to have never had a proper job although he has worked in several areas, including bars, restaurants, construction, pizza delivery, on film sets and driving a taxi. Thomas is married and lives with his wife and three children in Brooklyn. Writing career Prior to his international success as a novelist, Thomas wrote poetry and performed in the capacity of a singer-songwriter. Later, whilst attending graduate school, he studied a fiction program, with his thesis being a collection of short stories. One of these short stories became his debut novel. =Man Gone Down= Thomas's debut novel, Man Gone Down, won the 2009 International Dublin Literary Award on 11 June 2009. The prize, which is the richest literary award in the world (apart from the Nobel Prize in Literature) and is open to novels written in all languages, was €100,000 (£85,000, US$140,000). Thomas was the third author to win with a debut novel, following Andrew Miller's Ingenious Pain (1999) and Rawi Hage's De Niro's Game (2007). The book was praised by the judges, who included James Ryan, for its \\"energy and warmth\\" and for being \\"tuned urgently to the way we live now\\". Thomas said he had been \\"feeling a little desperate\\" during the writing of it. Man Gone Down beat an international longlist of 147 titles from 41 countries, as well as seven other shortlisted nominations such as The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz and The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid, as well as novels by established authors such as Doris Lessing, Joyce Carol Oates and Philip Roth. It was nominated by the National Library Service of Barbados. In 2007, Man Gone Down was named in the top ten of a list by The New York Times. Thomas attended the prize ceremony in Dublin, saying he was \\"stunned\\" and \\"still waiting for the punch line\\". He expressed his disbelief that he had even made the shortlist – \\"or the longlist, for that matter\\". He expects to \\"pay some bills\\" with the money as well as \\"a mortgage, a half-built house\\".

Founded in 2005 by Zach Bonner, the organization has raised thousands of dollars to build apartments for the needy. History The Little Red Wagon Foundation was founded in 2005 by Zach Bonner and his mother when he was seven years old. He founded the organization to aid poverty-stricken children. Bonner said that, \\"These kids don't have a home, they don't have a safe place to sleep at night. They're out on the streets not because they want to be, but because it's out of their control.\\" Prior to establishing the organization, Bonner aided children during the aftermath of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Pulling his little red wagon, he went to neighboring households and collected 27 truckloads of disaster supplies, including tarps and water. He established the organization \\"[t]o continue helping kids more efficiently\\" and because federal law restricted how many donations he could receive. The organization was christened the \\"Little Red Wagon Foundation\\" because he was given this moniker by his neighbors when he was collecting donations. 2007 walk In 2007, Zach Bonner walked 250 miles from Valrico, Tampa, Florida, to Tallahassee over a period of 23 days. His walk was inspired by a documentary about the Peace Pilgrim, a woman who walked 25,000 miles to advocate peace. During the walk, Cracker Barrel donated 50 meals to Zach Bonner and his fellow walkers. At night, he; his sister, Kelley; and his mother, Laurie; slept in an RV. The RV would be parked in state parks, and every morning, Bonner and his fellow walkers would be transported by a car to the stopping point of the preceding day. The walk ended at the Florida State Capitol, and raised $25,000. 2008 walk In 2008, Zach Bonner went on a 270 mile walk from Tallahassee, Florida to Atlanta, Georgia. The walk raised over $7,000 to help pay for a Habitat for Humanity home for a homeless family in Macon, Georgia. 2009 walk In 2009, Zach Bonner went on a walk from Atlanta, Georgia, to the White House to raise money to build apartments for the 1.3 million homeless children in the U.S. The trip had a projected cost of $6,000. Bonner said that he was going on the walk because \\"[t]hirteen kids on average die everyday for no other reason than the effects of being homeless. I walk for them. I walk to help give a voice to the kids that do not have one.\\" Every day, Bonner, his older sister, and his mother Laurie walked about 10 to 13 miles. After every couple of days of walking, Zach Bonner changed shoes. During the walk, the Bonners listened to their iPods when they are on backroads. When they were on busier roads, they did not because they had to \\"pay attention to the road and make sure [they] don't get run over\\". At night, Zach Bonner slept in an RV driven by his mother, while his sister slept in a Volkswagen Beetle. The 668-mile, 59-day walk was completed on July 10. He met with Saxby Chambliss and spoke with several other U.S. Senators on Capitol Hill. He slept at the Sasha Bruce emergency shelter. Bonner collected letters from children and at the end of his two-month trek, he gave the letters to President Barack Obama. When he reached Washington D.C., he received a $25,000 donation from Elton John. The money was used to renovate apartments for homeless children. 2010 walk In 2010, Bonner walked from Tampa to Los Angeles. Calling the trip \\"March Across America\\", he began the 2,478-mile walk on March 23, 2010. The 2,478 mile trip took nearly six months to finish. At a speed of three miles per hour, Bonner walked five hours every day. He covered about an average of 17–22 miles every day. Throughout the walk, he visited homeless shelters to hold activities for the children who live there, such as having parties for them. Bonner's family walked with him during the trip. His mother, Laurie, was with him for the entire walk. His sister, Kelley, walked with him for six weeks, and his brother, Matt, walked the second half of the journey with him. The Office Depot Foundation donated 2,478 backpacks to needy children, one for every mile Bonner walks. On September 14, 2010, Bonner completed the nearly 2,500-mile-walk to Los Angeles. Post-2010 The foundation aims to start a resource center in Tampa, Florida so that children can receive food and clothes and use computers. During Bonner's 2010 March Across America project, he encountered Phoenix's Tumbleweed Center for the first time. Tumbleweed's outreach service for homeless youth impressed Bonner who planned to model his own resource center in Tampa after it.

Formed in 2005 by frontman Marcos César, the band quickly became one of the top metal acts in their native country, Portugal. Their name was influenced by the Brazilian band Legião Urbana. Their discography includes two full-lengths albums, Diary of a No (2007), Loneliness still is the friend (2011) a 3-song EP, Alive (2008) and 4 singles \\"The Name of Love\\" (2016), \\"The Start feat Loren Dayle\\" (2017), \\"All Said and Done feat Sofia Pires\\" (2017), and \\"A Loucura No Amor feat Victor Espadinha\\" (2018), which will all be included on a yet to be released album, already named Reborn. Marcos, mentioned in an interview that the new work will be very different from the previous one, and that will be sung in Portuguese and English.  \\"Diary of a No\\" era  In the first year of existence, the Lisbon project records the first demo, with songs as relevant as In Purity, You'll Never Know or Until I Died. With the first 4 songs, the UT, attracted the attention of the media (mainly of the well-known Metal Incandescente blog), being even considered as one of the most promising national bands, by several specialized music sites. With some options to edit the first album of originals, the band signs with the international Burning Star Records, thus ensuring distribution and promotion worldwide. And while recording the debut album, they finished the first video for the single that was already on the national radio In Purity. With João Correia performing and Rui Neto as main actor, the band reaches a new level of exposure as several television channels such as MTV, SIC Radical and is considered one of the best music videos of the year. Single In Purity gets the top of the most requested music lists for several months. In November 2007, the project's first album sees the light of day. Titled Diary of a NO, the work reflects the experiences of vocalist and mentor Marcos César and demonstrates the band as one of the strongest of the year. Diary of a No, was released in DIGIPACK format and with the artwork created by Guto Soares; contains 10 songs, a documentary with a making of, of the album (as well as several extras). The album surprises everyone at the sales level and achieves fantastic reviews all over the world. The second single Prison Inside, also gets at the national (and international) radios, as well as the second Video (realized by Ricardo Capristano), and it passes in several television programs. \\"Farewell\\" was the third single which also features a video by Marco Bertrand.

These kinds of beetles are responsible for extensive damage of coniferous forest infestation in Europe and North America. Since lineatin can act as lures used for mass-trapping of T. lineatum, it is being studied to apply as a pest control reagent. Structure Lineatin was first isolated in 1977 by MacConnell. The absolute configuration of the biologically active form was later determined as (+)-(1R,4S,5R,7R)-3,3,7-trimethyl-2,9- dioxatricyclo[3.3.1.04,7]nonane, whereas other enatinomers process no biological attraction activity. Total Synthesis After the absolute structure was determined, lineatin quickly attracted considerable synthetic interests due to its natural occurrence, biological activity, and unique structural features. A few routes describing the total synthesis of lineatin was proposed with yields of 0.5–2%. Recently, a new total synthesis route that adopted a photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition approach to construct diastereoselective cyclobutene and a regiocontrolled oxymercuration reaction was proposed. This route achieved in synthesizing highly pure (+)-lineatin (> 99.5% ee) through 14 steps and resulted in 14% overall yield from a homochiral 2(5H)-furanone. (Figure 1 showed the basic outline of this approach). Figure 1: Lineatin total synthesis Biosynthesis Lineatin is a monoterprene with unique tricyclic acetal structure. Most of the studies regarding lineatin were focused on the total synthesis; little attentions were put on its biosynthesis. It is suggested that lineatin is derived through oxidation and cyclization of a monoterponid precursor, but no experimental has been done on proving this route. Based on its partial structure similarity to iridoid class of terprenoids, here, a possible biosynthesis pathway was proposed and outlined in figure 2.

She was Australia's first female mayor, serving as mayor of Newtown, New South Wales, from 1937 to 1939. She later represented the seat of Newtown in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1944 to 1950. She had a long involvement with the Lang Labor faction of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which had evolved into a separate party by the time of her election to parliament. Early life Fowler was born at Cooma, New South Wales. She was the third daughter of farmer Charles Munro Gill and Frances Rebecca, née Gaunson. After receiving a primary school education she became closely involved in Labor politics with the assistance of her father, a Labor League organiser and an Alderman, Valuer and Inspector of Nuisances for the Municipal District of Cooma. On 19 April 1909, while working as a waitress in Sydney, she married bootmaker Albert Edward Fowler, a widower, at Whitefield Congregational Church. Her uncle, John Munro Gill (1838–1917), a boilermaker of Granville, also served as an Alderman of the Municipality of Granville (North Ward; 1898–1906). Her younger brother, Percy Thomas Algernon Gill (1889–1957), a labourer of Rosebery, served as an Alderman of the Municipality of Waterloo (1934–1937). Early political career Fowler was made secretary of the Newtown-Erskineville Political Labor League, and from 1917 managed the electorate of Newtown MP Frank Burke, an anti-conscriptionist. Elected to the central executive of the Australian Labor Party 1920–21 and 1923–25, she and Jack Lang were behind the move to admit James Dooley at the 1923 conference. Fowler was also instrumental in the anti-corruption moves at the conference which led to the exposure of sliding-panel ballot boxes. She resigned from the central executive in 1932. She was president of the Labor Women's Central Organising Committee 1926–27, lobbying New South Wales Premier Jack Lang to implement widows' pensions and child endowments. She also petitioned the governor regarding the appointment of women to the Legislative Council, and organised the first interstate Labor Women's conference. Appointed justice of the peace in 1921, one of the first women so appointed, she separated from her husband shortly before she was elected to Newtown Municipal Council in 1928; she was the first woman elected to any local council in New South Wales, holding office as an Alderman for Camden ward from 1934 to the Council's amalgamation with the City of Sydney in 1948. On 7 December 1937 Fowler made history again when she was elected as Australia's first female mayor, with her daughter serving as Mayoress. She was re-elected for a second term as mayor on 6 December 1938 and held the mayoralty until 1939, when the 10-member Labor caucus on Council decided on Raymond Beaufils, the President of the Enmore ALP Branch, as the next candidate for mayor and Fowler did not contest the vote. In recognition of her achievements Fowler was presented with an illuminated address signed by former Premier Lang and Federal shadow Minister Jack Beasley. A portrait depicting her in the robes of mayor was painted by Reginald Jack Shepherd (Ald. Mrs Fowler) and was a finalist in the 1938 Archibald Prize for portraiture. State politics The Argus, on her election to state parliament in 1944. In 1941, Fowler unsuccessfully ran against Burke for the seat of Newtown as an independent Labor candidate. She ran again as a Lang Labor candidate in 1944, campaigning for reduced taxation, better housing and more day nurseries and baby clinics, and defeating Burke to become the third woman elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since its inception in 1856. In Parliament she condemned the Labor Party's centrist tendencies and opposed intervention from Canberra in New South Wales affairs. Her principal legislative achievement was an amendment to the Lunacy Act in 1944 to secure the release of Boyd Sinclair from a lunatic asylum where he had been held since 1936 so that he could stand trial in a criminal court for the alleged murder of a Sydney taxi driver. A fierce critic of bureaucracy, she supported regrouping local councils, and lost her own council seat when Newtown was merged with the City of Sydney in 1949. Fowler was re-elected in 1947, but was defeated in the 1950 election by the \\"official\\" Labor candidate Arthur Greenup. In 1953 she was unsuccessful in an attempt to win election to Sydney City Council. Later life and legacy Fowler did not long survive her retirement from politics; she died in King George V Memorial Hospital on 11 May 1954 from coronary occlusion and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery with Methodist rites. She was survived by a daughter. The federal division of Fowler is named for her, as is Fowler Place, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm.

The conference involved the German army and navy arguing which division should take command of German activity in World War I. The German navy under Admiral Holtzendorff desired unrestricted submarine warfare to shut down the North Atlantic trade supplying Britain with food and munitions. The navy felt that it could starve Britain within six months to a year, before American troops could arrive on the Western Front and change the war. A memo was drafted by Admiral Holtzendorff in December 1916 before the Pless Conference, that argued for unrestricted submarine warfare. Pressure mounted on Kaiser Wilhem II to agree with the memo, which he had previously disagreed with due to his commitment to a policy of moderation. The Kaiser relented following the Allied rejection of the German offer for peace in Dec 1916 and agreed with the memo. The Kaiser announced invitations to both the army and navy for the conference to announce his decision. Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg resigned due to his displeasure with the use of unrestricted sub warfare. Unconditional submarine warfare was then set to begin Jan. 31 attacking all ships within the British coastal zone and Atlantic. Text of the Holtzendorff Memo The Chief of the Admiralty Staff of the Navy Berlin, 22 December 1916 B 35 840 I To the Royal Field-Marshal Chief of the General Staff of the Army His Excellency v. Beneckendorff und v. Hindenburg. Great Headquarters Most Secret! I have the honour to respectfully submit to your Excellency in the attachment a memorandum on the necessity for the commencement an unrestricted campaign of submarine warfare at the earliest opportunity. The memorandum is essentially a continuation of the memorandum Ref. No. 22 247 I of 27 August 1916: The Merchant Tonnage Issue and the Supply of England in 1916, which has previously been submitted to your Excellency. Based on the detailed information attached to this memorandum, I would like to ask your Excellency to kindly follow the line of argument laid out below, and I hope to achieve agreement that it is absolutely necessary to increase our measures against England as soon as possible to the very limit of our abilities in order to exploit the favourable situation and to obtain a swift victory. I. The war requires a decision before autumn 1917, lest it should end in the mutual exhaustion of all parties and thus in a disaster for us. Of our enemies, Italy and France are already so severely weakened in their economic foundations that they are kept in the fight only through England's energy and resources. If we succeed to break England's backbone, the war will immediately be decided in our favour. England's backbone is the merchant tonnage, which delivers essential imports for their survival and for the military industry of the British islands and which ensures the [kingdom's] ability to pay for its imports from abroad. II. The current situation in respect to the merchant tonnage has already been mentioned in the memorandum of 27 August and is laid out in further detail in the attachment. In all brevity the situation is as follows: The [shipping] rates have reached outrageous levels, often as much as ten times as much [as in peacetime] for many important goods. We know with certainty from a variety of sources that merchant tonnage is lacking everywhere. The current English merchant tonnage can safely be assumed to be in the order of 20 million gross register tons. 8.6 million tons of these are requisitioned for military purposes, and 1/2 million is employed in coastal trade. Approximately 1 million [tons] are undergoing repairs or are otherwise temporarily unavailable. Approximately 2 million tons are sailing for other allies, which leaves about 8 million tons of English merchant tonnage to provide for the supply of England. An analysis of statistical figures of ship movements in British ports suggests an even lower figure. In the months of July - September 1916 only 6 million tons were employed in the trade with England. In addition to that, other tonnage sailing in the trade with England can be assumed to amount to around 900,000 tons of enemy - non-English - and approximately 3 million tons of neutral tonnage. Hence, no more than 10 million GRT are at the disposal for the supply of England. III. If the achievements in our battle against merchant tonnage have been encouraging thus far, then the exceptionally poor world harvest of grain, including feed grain, this year provides us with a unique opportunity, which nobody could responsibly reject. Both North America and Canada will probably cease their grain exports to England in February. Then that country will have to draw its grain supplies from the more distant Argentina, but since Argentina will only be able to deliver very limited quantities, because of the poor harvest, England will have to turn to India and mostly Australia. In the attachment it is explained in detail how such an increase in the length of the grain routes will require an extra 720,000 tons of tonnage for the grain shipments alone. In practice, the implications will be that, until August 1917, 3/4 million tons of the available 10 million tons will have to be employed for a service, which had hitherto not been required. IV. Under such favourable circumstances an energetic blow conducted with all force against English merchant tonnage will promise a certain success in a way that I have to reiterate and emphasize my statements made on 27 August 1916 that \\"our clearly defined strategic objective is to force a decision in our favour through the destruction of [enemy] sea transport capacity\\" and also that \\"from a military point of view it would be irresponsible not to make use of the submarine weapon now.\\" As things stand at the moment, I cannot vouch that a campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare will force England to make peace within five months time. This reservation needs to be made in respect to the unrestricted submarine warfare only. Of the currently conducted submarine warfare under cruiser a decisive result cannot be expected, regardless of the circumstances, even if all armed merchantmen are designated as legitimate targets. V. Based on a monthly rate of destruction of 600,000 tons of shipping through a campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, as pointed out previously, and on the well grounded expectation, elaborated upon in the attachment, that at least two fifths of the neutral tonnage sailing in the trade with England will be deterred by such a campaign, it stands to reason that the current volume English sea borne trade will be reduced by 39% within five months. This would not be bearable for England, neither in view of her future position after the war, nor in view of her ability to continue the war effort. Already, the country is at the verge of a food crisis, which will soon compel it to attempt to undertake the same food rationing measures, which we, as a blockaded country, have been forced to adopt since the outbreak of the war. The preconditions for implementing such measures are totally different and infinitely more unfavourable than in our case. They do not have the necessary administration and their population is unused to submitting to such privations. Then there is another reason why the uniform rationing of bread for the whole population will not be possible in England at this point. It was possible for Germany at a time in which bread could be substituted by other foodstuffs. That moment has been missed in England. But with only three fifths of the current sea borne trade, the continued supply with [alternative] foodstuffs cannot be maintained unless a severe rationing of grain is imposed—provided the war industry is to be maintained at its current output level. The objection that England could have sufficient domestic stockpiles of grain and raw materials has been disproved in detail in the attachment. In addition to that, the unrestricted submarine campaign would cut off England from the trade with Denmark and the Netherlands, which would result in an immediate shortage of fats, since one third of all butter imports and the entire margarine imports to England originate in Denmark and the Netherlands respectively. Moreover, by threatening the sea routes to Scandinavia and intensifying activities against the Spanish iron-ore trade, it would result in a scarcity of iron-ore and wood. This will automatically reduce the coal production for lack of wood. In consequence it would also reduce the output of pig iron, steel, and subsequently the production of munitions, which depends on both. Finally, it gives us the long hoped for opportunity to strike at neutral munitions shipments, and thus it will also provide a relief for the army. By contrast, a submarine campaign according to cruiser rules, even assuming the possibility of indiscriminate attacks on armed merchantmen, would only yield a reduction of the tonnage sailing for England by 5 × 400,000 tons—about 18%--or less than half of what could be achieved by unrestricted submarine warfare. Experience so far does not suggest that the authorization to torpedo armed merchantmen would improve upon the result of 400,000 tons of destroyed merchant tonnage, which has been achieved over the past two months. In fact, it is likely to merely compensate for a decline, which has to be expected in the course of progressing arming [of merchantmen]. I am aware that even a reduction of one fifth of English sea borne trade will have a severe impact on the English supply situation. However, I consider it unthinkable that the current English leadership under Lloyd George, who is absolutely determined, could be forced to make peace on these grounds, particularly since the constraints of fat, iron-ore, and wood scarcity—and the latters' impact on the munitions production—would not come into effect. Furthermore, the psychological effects of panic and terror cannot be exploited. These effects, which can only be achieved by a campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare are, in my view, an indispensable prerequisite for success. Just how important they are, can be judged by the experiences made when we initiated submarine warfare in early 1915, or even during the brief period of the submarine campaign in March and April 1916, when the British believed that we were serious about it. A further precondition [for success] is that the beginning and the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare should coincide in a manner that leaves no room for negotiations, particularly between England and the neutrals. Only then will the effect of shock have the most profound impact on the enemy and the neutrals. VI. Upon the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare the United States government will once more be compelled to make a decision whether or not to take the consequences of its previous position vis-à-vis the unrestricted submarine warfare. I am absolutely of the opinion that war with the United States is such a serious matter that everything has to be undertaken to avoid it. Fear of a diplomatic rupture however, should not lead us to recoil from the use of a weapon that promises victory for us. At any rate, it is realistic to assume the worst case as the most probable one and to consider, which impact an American entry into the war on the side of our enemies would have on the course of the war. In respect to the merchant tonnage this impact is likely to be negligible. It cannot be expected that more than a fraction of the interned central power tonnage in American—and perhaps in other neutral ports—can be put into the trade with England at short notice. The overwhelming part of it can be rendered useless in a manner that it will be unable to sail during the first, critical months. All preparations in this respect have been made. Also, there would be no crews available in the initial stages. The American troops would be of equally little import, if only for the lack of bottoms to carry them over here in great numbers; the same applies to American money, which cannot compensate the lack of tonnage. The only question that remains would be how America would react to a peace, which Great Britain would be forced to accept. It is unlikely that it would decide to continue the war against us, since it has no means to strike at us decisively, whereas its sea borne commerce would suffer from our submarines. Indeed, it is to be expected that it will join England in making peace, in order to restore healthy economic conditions. Therefore my conclusion is that a campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, launched in time to produce a peace before the harvest of the summer 1917—i.e. 1 August—has to accept the risk of American belligerence, because we have no other option. In spite of the diplomatic rupture with America, the unrestricted submarine warfare is nevertheless the right means to conclude this war victoriously. It is also the only means to this end. VII. Since I have declared the time come to strike against England in autumn 1916 the situation has even improved tremendously in our favour. The crop failure, in conjunction with the impact of the war on England up to now, gives us the opportunity to force a decision before the next harvest. If we do not make use of what seems to be the last chance, then I see no other option than that of mutual exhaustion, without our succeeding to bring the war to an end on terms that will guarantee our future as a world power. In order to achieve the required results, the unrestricted submarine warfare has to commence no later than 1 February. I request from your Excellency an indication, whether the military situation on the continent, particularly in regard to the remaining neutrals, would allow this schedule. The necessary preparations can be completed within three weeks time.

European J. Plant Path. 121(4), 439-449. Capsidiol is categorized under the broad term of phytoalexin, a class of low molecular weight plant secondary metabolites that are produced during infection.Hammerschmidt R. (1999). \\"Phytoalexins: What have we learned after 60 years?\\" Anni. Rev. Phytopathol. 37, 285-306. Phytoalexins are also characterized as a part of a two pronged response to infection which involves a short term response consisting of production of free radicals near the site of infection and a long term response involving the production of hormones and an increase in enzymes to biosynthesize phyoalexins such as capsidiol. Mechanism of production Capsidiol is produced in the pepper fruit Capsicum annuum or tobacco Nicotiana tabacum after infection by the oomycete water-mold Phytophthora capsici. In pepper or tobacco fields, the oomycete is soil-borne and initially infects roots, collars and lower leaves. Sporangia are moved within fields by contact with field equipment, clothing, gloves, tools etc. and initial infections spread zoospores through splashing of water from irrigation or rain.Uchida J.Y.; Aragaki M. (1980). \\"Chemical Stimulation of oospore formation in Phytophthoracapsici\\". Mycologia 72, 1103-1108. Initial responses to infection include production of radical oxygen species, including H2O2.Arreola-Cortes A.; Castro-Mercado E.; Lozoya-Gloria E.; Garcia-Pineda E. (2007). \\"Capsidiol production in pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum) induced by arachidonic acid is dependent of an oxidative burst\\". Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 70(1-3): 69-76. Exogenous treatment with H2O2 alone has been shown to induce capsidiol production. Capsidiol production is then increased in response to radical oxygen species production. Biosynthesis Capsidiol is a bicyclic terpene that is biosynthetically derived from the mevalonate pathway via farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). The E,E-farnesyl cation is first created by the loss of pyrophosphate. Kinetic studies have indicated that turnover appears to be limited by a chemical step after the initial loss of pyrophosphate.Dewick P.M. (2002).\\"The biosynthesis of C5-C25 terpenoid compounds\\". Nat. Prod. Rep. 16', 97-130 Crystal structures of recombinant tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS), alone and also complexed with two FPP analogues have been reported and analyzed to suggest the following mechanism of biosynthesis.Starks C.M.; Back K.; Chappell J.; Noel J.P.; (1997) Structural Basis for Cyclic Terpene Biosynthesis by Tobacco 5-Epi- Aristolochene Synthase. Science 277, 1815-1820 The E,E-farnesyl cation undergoes cyclization to form the germacryl cation. The second ring closure gives the bicyclic eudesmyl cation, which is stabilized by various dipole interactions, then H-2 migrates to C-3 producing a tertiary cation at C-2 (farnesyl numbering). Production of 5-epi-aristolochene from FPP by 5-epi- aristolochene 3-hydroxylase, a sesquiterpene cyclase, is considered the critical step in capsidiol biosynthesis. Aristolochene synthase enzymes from Penicillium roqueforti, Nicotiana tabacum have been purified and their crystal structures have been reported suggesting different steriochemistries for aristolochene. Penicillium roquefortis enzyme appears to synthesizes aristolochene by way of (S)-germacrene A , however, the Nicotiana tabacum enzyme 5-epi-aristolochene synthase produces the diastereoisomeric product by way of (R)-germacrene A.

In 1893, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NH) leased the Old Colony Railroad and took over operations on its lines. In 1905, NH replaced the station with a larger building. When the nearby military training facility of Camp Edwards (now part of Joint Base Cape Cod) was built in 1940–1941, a spur line was built from North Falmouth station to Camp Edwards station on the base. Scheduled service to North Falmouth ended in 1964 when NH discontinued its passenger service to Cape Cod, and in 1969, the station building burned down. In 2009, the Woods Hole Branch's right-of-way south of the former North Falmouth station was paved as part of the extension of the Shining Sea Bikeway. The former station site is used as the bike path's northern terminus and parking lot. As of 2017, the Woods Hole Branch north of the former station site and the spur to Joint Base Cape Cod are in active use. The tracks are used by the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad to haul trash from the Upper Cape Regional Transfer Station to the Southeastern Massachusetts Resource Recovery Facility (SEMASS) waste- to-energy and recycling facility.

Function  TMEM18 seems to affect energy levels through insulin and glucagon signaling, and in flies, its downregulation induces a metabolic state resembling type-II diabetes Overexpression of the TMEM18 protein increases the migration capacity of neural stem cells while inactivation of TMEM18 results in almost complete loss of migration activity. The TMEM18 gene is ubiquitously expressed in both mammalian and fly tissues, which suggests a basic cellular function. In the mouse brain, it is found in the majority of all cells, but is more abundant in neurons than other cell types.  Clinical significance  Genetic variants in the proximity of the TMEM18 gene are associated with obesity, insulin levels, and blood sugar levels Evolutionary history The TMEM18 gene has a long evolutionary history as it is present in both plants and animals. The TMEM18 protein's amino acid sequence is well conserved, which suggests that it has retained its function since the divergence of human and plants. The gene seems to have been lost in two separate lineages, but is not found duplicated in any analyzed genomes.

Constructed in 1969, the building is an example of the international style of architecture. In 2012, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name \\"Riverview\\".Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 7/02/12 through 7/06/12, National Park Service, 2012-07-13. Accessed 2012-08-25. It was designed as the world headquarters for the Toledo manufacturer Owens-Corning Fiberglass Company, which occupied the building for 27 years until moving elsewhere in downtown Toledo in 1996. Until October 2018, the building was vacant. In October 2016, the Eyde Company renamed the building Tower on the Maumee and announced plans to transform the top floors into luxury apartments and renovate the commercial office space on the lower floors. History Riverview One Corp., the developer of the project, expected construction to cost between $12 million and $18 million. The tower was designed by architects Harrison & Abramovitz of New York and the general contractor was Turner Construction of New York. The Fort Meigs Hotel, a 10-story building constructed in 1927, occupied the downtown Toledo site at 200 North Saint Clair Street until 1966 when it and other structures were demolished in preparation for the Riverview project. Groundbreaking for Fiberglas Tower was held on May 1, 1967. Leadership of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. announced at the groundbreaking that they planned to occupy the tower. The unusual spelling of its original name (Fiberglas instead of Fiberglass) comes from Owens-Corning's use of Fiberglas as the trademark name of its glass fiber products, as the generic name fiberglass could not be restricted to use as a trademark. Topping out of the tower occurred on April 5, 1968. Owens-Corning occupied nearly all of the Fiberglas Tower when it opened in July 1969. In 1993, Owens-Corning announced plans to vacate the Fiberglas Tower. The tower remained vacant for more than twenty years after the O-C departure in 1996. Asbestos, which was partially responsible for OC's departure, was removed in 2012. In 2017, Eyde announced that renovations by Quinn Evans Architects were partially complete and that a new tenant would move in in 2018. In October 2018, Directions Credit Union became the first business to occupy space in the renovated building. The company moved its headquarters there from Sylvania.

After grave injuries al-Qaraawi received as a result of a drone attack in Pakistan, and his eventual capture upon his return to Saudi Arabia by the Saudi authorities, the leadership of the Brigades was assumed by Majid al-Majid, another Saudi affiliated with Fateh Al Islam and Al-Qaeda.

Al-Majid was succeeded by Sirajuddin Zureiqat. History The Abdallah Azzam Brigades was formed by the Saudi national Saleh Al-Qaraawi in 2009 as an offshoot of al-Qaeda in Iraq, and was tasked with hitting targets in the Levant and throughout the Middle East. Qaraawi is a Saudi citizen and is on the list of 85 most-wanted terrorists that was issued by the Saudi Interior Ministry in 2009. The group formally announced its establishment in a July 2009 video statement claiming responsibility for a February 2009 rocket attack against Israel. After attacks by the Ziad al Jarrah Battalion, a Lebanese affiliate of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a communique was released clarifying that the Brigades operated on a wider scale. The communique said: \\"[The Abdullah Azzam Brigades] are not confined to Lebanon but there are targets that our fires will reach Allah‐willing in the near future...the Brigades are formed of a number of groups that are spread in numerous places...and the groups of 'Ziad al‐Jarrah' in Lebanon are only some of our groups, and we rushed to create these groups and announced them because of the urgency of the battle with the Jews and the priority of the initiative at the time and the place, but the rest of the groups are outside Lebanon.\\" In an interview to Al-Jazeera in August 2010, a Yemeni expert on Islamic movements asserted that although violent acts had been claimed by groups using Abdullah Azzam in their name, it was only in 2009 after the Gaza War that the Abdullah Azzam Brigades organization was established. =Branches= The Abdullah Azzam Brigades has branches active in multiple countries: * The Lebanese branch has used the name the Ziad al Jarrah Battalion, and is named after Lebanese 9/11 hijacker Ziad al Jarrah who participated in the hijacking and crash of United Flight 93. * The Abdullah Azzam Brigades branch in the Arabian Peninsula calls itself the Yusuf al-’Uyayri Battalions, named after Yusef al-Ayeri, the slain founder of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia. * In Gaza strip, the group had used the name Marwan Haddad division of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades in the Levant.

In a statement issued by the group's emir, Majid bin Muhammad al-Majid, in June 2012, the group acknowledged its fight against the forces of President Bashar al Assad in the Syrian Civil War. Majid recommended that the rebels avoid use of car bombs and bomb belts inside cities for fear of harming and alienating Syrian civilians. This advice is in contrast to the actions of another Salafist Jihadist group active in the Syrian Civil War, the Al-Nusra Front. =Lebanon= On 19 November 2013, the Brigade claimed responsibility for a double suicide bombing outside the Iranian embassy in Beirut, which killed at least 22 people and wounded over 140. The group said the bombing was retaliation for Iranian support of Hezbollah, which fights on the Syrian government's side in the current Syrian civil war, and warned of further attacks should Iran's government not acquiesce. On 19 February 2014, the brigade carried out an attack on the Iranian Cultural Center in Beirut's southern suburb of Bir-Hasan, killing 11 and wounding 130, their motive was the support of Iran in the Syrian war. ;Arrest and death of Majid al-Majid On 27 December 2013, Lebanese authorities captured Majid bin Mohammad al-Majid, the Saudi leader of the group.Lebanon arrests alleged al Qaeda-linked militant France24 Al-Majid had undergone kidney treatment at the Makased hospital in Beirut. The hospital had released him and he had reportedly hidden in a Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh, near Saida. He allegedly tried to move elsewhere for more medical treatment, but was captured by the Lebanese army on the Beirut-Damascus highway. On 3 January 2014, DNA tests confirmed that the man detained by Lebanese army intelligence is Majid al-Majid, the chief of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades. The DNA samples belonging to relatives of Majid in Saudi Arabia matched those of the suspect who remained in custody of the Lebanese Armed Forces, Lebanon's state National News Agency reported.

The poem discusses a time in which Coleridge was forced to stay beneath a lime tree while his friends were able to enjoy the countryside. Within the poem, Coleridge is able to connect to his friend's experience and enjoy nature through him, making the lime tree only a physical prison, not a mental one. Background During summer 1797, Coleridge was surrounded by many friends, including John Thelwall, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Thomas Poole, and his wife Sara Fricker. During this time, he would relax, enjoy the surroundings, and work on poetry. However, there were problems between him and his wife, and she suffered from a miscarriage at the end of July. It was within this setting that Coleridge composed a poem while left alone at Poole's property underneath a lime tree while Lamb, the Wordsworths, and his wife went on a journey across the Quantocks. The poem was dedicated to Lamb, Fricker, and the generic friends, but Fricker's name was left out of the published edition.Holmes 1989 pp. 152–153 Coleridge later explained to Robert Southey that he stayed behind because his wife \\"accidentally emptied a skillet of boiling milk on my foot, which confined me during the whole time of C. Lamb's stay.\\"Ashton 1997 qtd. p. 105 The location of Poole's home was Nether Stowey, which contained a garden, an arbour, and a tannery, and a little cottage that Coleridge stayed in while working on poetry. The arbour, containing the lime tree, was a place that Coleridge favored in a note to Poole's edition of Coleridge's poems:Ashton 1997 p. 91 \\"I love to shut my eyes, and bring before my imaginations that Arbour, in which I have repeated so many of these compositions to you. Dear Arbour! An Elysium to which I have often passed by your Cerberus, and Tartarean tan-pits!\\".Ashton 1997 qtd. p. 91 The first version of the poem was sent in a letter to Southey and was only 56 lines. The 1800 edition, the first published edition, was 76 lines long.Ashton 1997 p. 105 The poem was also revised and published under another name in Southey's Annual Anthology. A later revised edition was included in Sibylline Leaves, Coleridge's 1817 collection of poems.Mays 2001 p. 350 Poem The poem begins by explaining how the narrator was separated from his friends:Ashton 1997 p. 107 The poem then describes the journey in the Quantocks from Lamb's point of view, and then goes on to describe Lamb:Holmes 1989 p. 154 Twilight is described as calming and the poem continues with night's fall:Holmes 1989 p. 155 Themes The use of blank verse is to emphasize the conversational elements of the poem in a similar manner to William Cowper's The Task. Like Cowper's, Coleridge's verse allows for alternations of tone and emphasizes both country and urban environments. However, Coleridge is more concrete than Cowper in the sense that the ego stands in the foreground - in The Task the I, though dominant, purports to follow its subject matter. In \\"This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison\\" Coleridge attempts to discover the environment that his friends explore because he is unable to join them. This was accomplished in the original version by first describing how his friends came to be walking and then discussing Lamb's experience on the walk. The work introduces religious imagery but in a toned down form out of deference to Lamb's Unitarianism and perhaps partly out of Coleridge's own pantheistic feelings.Ashton 1997 pp. 105–107 This Lime-Tree Bower continues the \\"Conversation poems\\" theme of \\"One Life\\", a unity between the human and the divine in nature. The poem links Coleridge's surroundings under the lime tree to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb, and Fricker were out walking. Although they are all separated, Coleridge connects to his distant friends by their mutual experience and appreciation of nature. As the poem ends, the friends share together the same view about completion and life.Holmes 1989 pp. 154–155 The poem uses the image of loneliness and solitude throughout. The narrator is forced to stay behind, but he is glad that his friends, especially Lamb, are able to enjoy the walk. The narrator is able to relax and be accepting of his situation and of nature, and the experience shows that his prison condition is perfectly tolerable because it is physical and not mental.Yarlott 1967 pp. 111–113 The image of the solitary bee is used to represent the poet continuing his work in a world overcome by peace and harmony. The final moments of the poem contain a religious element and works like an evening prayer. Sources The poem finds its source in many of Coleridge's own poems, including Composed while Climbing Brockley Coomb, Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement and To Charles Lloyd, on his Proposing to Domesticate with the Author. However, it is also connected to poems by others, including Wordsworth's Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew- tree, passages from Southey's edition of Poems, and verses in Henry Vaughan's Silex Scintillans. He also cites from Withering's An Arrangement of British Plants.Mays 2001 pp. 349–353 Critical response Geoffrey Yarlott points out that the narrator's description of his scenery and condition \\"presents a clearer picture of what rapport with nature means than do the majority of [Coleridge's] formal Theistic passages. He writes now with his eye upon the object rather than the clouds, and with natural feelings. Where, earlier, he had seemed too much upon the stretch, as though trying to compel acceptance, he writes now with relaxed and easy confidence.\\"Yarlott 1967 p. 112 Later, Richard Holmes claims that Coleridge's description of his friends journey is contained \\"in a brilliant series of topographical reflections\\" and later that a \\"heightened directness of response appears in the new poem, which draws more powerfully than ever on the Quantocks imagery.\\"Holmes 1989 p. 153, 154 According to Rosemary Ashton, \\"He had much to be pleased with. The poem perfects the 'plain style' he had adopted in 'The Eolian Harp'. It is certainly plain compared to 'Religious Musings' and his other declamatory poems, and yet the tone is versatile, modulating from the conversational and the chatty into something unusually arresting.\\" In the 21st century, Adam Sisman declared that the poem \\"was a further development of the new style he had initiated in 'The Eolian Harp'. It was full of characteristic verbal inventiveness [...] now used to accompany detailed descriptions of natural forms, in a manner surely influenced by Dorothy.\\"Sisman 2006 p. 182 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

During puberty breast development is stymied and the breasts fail to develop normally and fully. The exact cause of this is as yet unclear; however, a study in 2011 of the cells in the breasts of both males and females with tubular breasts suggested a genetic link in a disorder of collagen deposition. The condition is thought to affect one to five per cent of breast augmentation patients; however, the proportion of the general population affected is unknown as surgery is not always sought. Background The tuberous breast deformity was first described by Rees and Aston in 1976 following which a method of classifying the severity was developed. The surgical classifications refer to which areas of the breast are affected and is divided into three grades; mainly in the inferomedial quadrant (Grade I); in the two inferior quadrants (Grade II); or affecting the whole breast (Grade III). Synonyms This condition is also known as constricted breasts, tubular breasts, herniated areolar complexes, conical breast, domen nipple, lower pole hypoplasia and hypoplastic breasts. Physical effects Tuberous breasts are not simply small or underdeveloped breasts. The effect of the condition on the appearance of the breast can range from mild to severe, and typical characteristics include: enlarged, puffy areola, unusually wide spacing between the breasts, minimal breast tissue, sagging, higher than normal breast fold,Tubular Breast Correction and narrow base at the chest wall. The condition can cause low milk supply in breastfeeding women. However, other physical aspects of fertility and pregnancy are not affected by the condition. Psychological effects Due to unrealistic societal expectations of breast size and shape, tubular breasts may lead to psychosexual problems with girls in very early puberty being affected psychologically due to the unusual shape of the breast. Surgical papers about the techniques useful in correcting tubular breasts note that even when results are not perfect, the psychological impact of treatment is immense, with notable improvements in self-esteem to the level where the person engages in normal social activities. Treatment The appearance of tuberous breasts can potentially be changed through surgical procedures, including the tissue expansion method and breast implants. The procedure to change the appearance of tuberous breasts can be more complicated than a regular breast augmentation, and some plastic surgeons have specialist training in tuberous breast correction. A less complicated single-stage approach using saline implants can also provide a satisfactory aesthetic result. As tuberous breasts are a congenital deformity, referral for treatment under the National Health Service may be possible in the United Kingdom.Policy for Cosmetic Surgery Referrals A starting point for those seeking such a referral may be a visit to their local General Practitioner. For those seeking non-surgical solutions, counseling may be recommended as a way of coming to terms with body image.

It is most often used for problems in which a relation between two positive integers is given, along with a statement to prove about its solutions. There are multiple methods of Vieta jumping, all of which involve the common theme of infinite descent by finding new solutions to an equation using Vieta's formulas.  History  Vieta jumping is a relatively new technique in solving mathematical olympiad problems, as the first olympiad problem to use it in a solution was proposed in 1988 for the International Mathematics Olympiad and assumed to be the most difficult problem on the contest: :Let and be positive integers such that divides . Show that \\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1} is the square of an integer. Arthur Engel wrote the following about the problem's difficulty: Among the eleven students receiving the maximum score for solving this problem were Ngô Bảo Châu, Ravi Vakil, Zvezdelina Stankova, Nicușor Dan. Emanouil Atanassov, Bulgaria, solved the problem in a paragraph and received a special prize.https://www.imo- official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=1586 Standard Vieta jumping The concept of standard Vieta jumping is a proof by contradiction, and consists of the following three steps: # Assume toward a contradiction that some solution exists that violates the given requirements. # Take the minimal such solution according to some definition of minimality. # Show that this implies the existence of a smaller solution, hence a contradiction. ; Example Problem #6 at IMO 1988: Let and be positive integers such that divides . Prove that is a perfect square. # Fix some value that is a non-square positive integer. Assume there exist positive integers for which . # Let be positive integers for which and such that is minimized, and without loss of generality assume . # Fixing , replace with the variable to yield . We know that one root of this equation is . By standard properties of quadratic equations, we know that the other root satisfies and . #The first expression for shows that is an integer, while the second expression implies that since is not a perfect square. From it further follows that is a positive integer. Finally, implies that and thus , which contradicts the minimality of . Constant descent Vieta jumping The method of constant descent Vieta jumping is used when we wish to prove a statement regarding a constant having something to do with the relation between and . Unlike standard Vieta jumping, constant descent is not a proof by contradiction, and it consists of the following four steps: # The equality case is proven so that it may be assumed that . # and are fixed and the expression relating , and is rearranged to form a quadratic with coefficients in terms of and , one of whose roots is . The other root, is determined using Vieta's formulas. # It is shown that for all above a certain base case, and that is an integer. Thus we may replace with and repeat this process until we arrive at the base case. # The statement is proven for the base case, and as has remained constant through this process, this is sufficient to prove the statement for all ordered pairs. ; Example Let and be positive integers such that divides . Prove that . # If must divide and thus and . So, without loss of generality, assume that . # Let and rearrange and substitute to get . One root to this quadratic is , so by Vieta's formulas the other root may be written as follows: . # The first equation shows that is an integer and the second that it is positive. Because as long as . # The base case we arrive at is the case where . For this to satisfy the given condition, must divide , making either 1 or 2. The first case is eliminated because . In the second case, . As has remained constant throughout this process, this is sufficient to show that will always equal 3. Geometric interpretation Vieta jumping can be described in terms of lattice points on hyperbolas in the first quadrant. The same process of finding smaller roots is used instead to find lower lattice points on a hyperbola while remaining in the first quadrant. The procedure is as follows: # From the given condition we obtain the equation of a family of hyperbolas that are unchanged by switching and so that they are symmetric about the line . # Prove the desired statement for the intersections of the hyperbolas and the line . # Assume there is some lattice point on some hyperbola and without loss of generality . Then by Vieta's formulas, there is a corresponding lattice point with the same -coordinate on the other branch of the hyperbola, and by reflection through a new point on the original branch of the hyperbola is obtained. # It is shown that this process produces lower points on the same branch and can be repeated until some condition (such as ) is achieved. Then by substitution of this condition into the equation of the hyperbola, the desired conclusion will be proven. ; Example This method can be applied to problem #6 at IMO 1988: Let and be positive integers such that divides . Prove that is a perfect square. # Let and fix the value of . Then represents a lattice point on the hyperbola defined by the equation . # If then we find , which trivially satisfies the statement. # Let be a lattice point on a branch , and assume so that it is on the higher branch. By applying Vieta's Formulas, is a lattice point on the lower branch of . Then, by reflection is a lattice point on the original branch. This new point has smaller -coordinate, and thus is below the original point. Since this point is on the upper branch, it is still above . # This process can be repeated. From the equation of , it is not possible for this process to move into the second quadrant. Thus, this process must terminate at and by substitution, is a square as required.

Life =Education= Frigyes Schulek was instrumental in the restoration of the Jáki Church Schulek was born in Pest and began school in Buda. His mother was Auguszta Zsigmondy. His father Ágost Schulek held a position in the Finance Ministry of Lajos Kossuth. The Schulek family accompanied Kossuth's government on its flight to Debrecen during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, then returned to the capital. After the suppression of the struggle for independence, Ágost Schulek was declared persona non grata, and the family returned to Debrecen. Graduating in 1857, Frigyes Schulek enrolled in the Buda Polytechnic (József Technical University), from which he received his diploma in 1861. Thereafter he attended the Academy of Fine Arts (Akademie der bildenden Künste) in Vienna which he finished in 1867.Schulek, Frigyes (Friedrich) (1841-1919), Architekt - Institut für Neuzeit- und Zeitgeschichtsforschung - Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815–1950 He became a member of the \\"Wiener Bauhütte\\" where he studied under Friedrich von Schmidt, who profoundly influenced his later interest in Middle Ages architecture. In 1866 he briefly worked on the restoration of the Regensburg Cathedral, subsequently visiting France and Italy. From 1871 he taught architectural drawing at the Budapest Art School, where, as a colleague of Imre Steindl, he helped design Pest's City Hall. In 1872 he was appointed architect of the newly founded Provisional Monuments Commission (Műemlékek Országos Bizottság), later known as the National Monuments Commission, the first such independent Hungarian organization. Here he coordinated the reconstruction and restoration of mediæval castles and churches. Ancestors of Frigyes Schulek: :hu: Schulek család (felvidéki) =Matthias church (Mátyás Templom)= Patterned roof design of Schulek's restored Matthias Church Between 1874 and 1896 Schulek rebuilt the Church of Our Lady in Buda Castle, which is generally regarded as his chief work. Dating to 1247, the edifice was used for coronations from the crowning of Charles I in 1309 and is today known as the Matthias Church, after King Matthias, who added side chapels and an oratory in 1470. In the course of planning the reconstruction, he did a thorough field survey of the Gothic church to expose the varying original elements of the building to learn how it had been built, rebuilt and enlarged over time. Originally built in an early French Gothic style, it had been destroyed by fire in 1526, then reopened as a mosque in 1541. After the Ottoman period and its 1586 reconversion to a church, the Franciscans and, later, the Jesuits maintained the edifice. Rather than choosing a particular historic period to interpret while conserving evidence of its earlier and later appearance, as is modern practice, Schulek practically constructed the church anew, without preserving the various historic interventions, and had nearly every stone replaced or recarved. On the west façade and the spire, where he could find no documentary evidence to assist him, he detailed his own new designs, to the point that the building as it stands today is almost entirely his creation. Calvinist Reformed Church in Ákos (today Acâș in Romania) =Professorship= In 1903, following Imre Steindl's death, Schulek was appointed professor of medieval architecture at the Technical University of Budapest, a post he held until 1913. He became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1895 and was made an honorary member in 1917. Architectural designs His other restorations include the town hall of Lőcse (now Levoča, Slovakia) and churches at Ákos (now Acâș in Romania), Karcsa and Pozsony (now Bratislava, Slovakia). Promenade atop Fisherman's Bastion Of the few buildings Schulek designed himself, most are in the Neo-Romanesque style. These include the Calvinist Reformed Church (1880–83) in Szeged and the Elisabeth Lookout (1908–10) at János-hegy, Budapest. Between 1895 and 1903 Schulek designed corridors, terraces and towers to connect still-extant portions of the hill fortress behind Matthias Church. Known as the Fisherman's Bastion (Halászbástya), the viewpoint has become a city landmark. His 1909 design for the Votive Church of Szeged (Fogadalmi templom), a twin-spired structure with red-brick façades and white stone trim, was modified by Ernő Foerk, and construction was completed by 1930.

Brief history WHHN is the second Catholic station in the Altoona market, the other being local low-power WMES which are not affiliated with each other nor co-owned. WHHN is owned and operated by Radio Maria Inc. and is a repeater of originating station KJMJ 580 kHz in Alexandria, Louisiana. WHHN's initial sign-on took place on Saturday morning, June 13, 2009. WHHN is the seventh of what is a network of repeaters originated by KJMJ which has been on the air since May 2000...the former KLBG and originally KALB (AM). In 2007, Radio Maria USA applied for ten additional frequencies on the FM band; up to that point it was only a six-station network comprising KJMJ (AM) with three repeaters (one AM and two FMs in Louisiana) with one AM in Texas and an FM and AM in Ohio. Audio streaming plays a huge part in its network operations as its repeater network slowly begins to grow. KJMJ with its repeaters and audiostream make up Radio Maria's only English language network. Radio Maria's international base is located in Erba (CO), within the Province of Como, Italy and is managed by its founder Emanuele Ferrario. In addition to its English language network, Radio Maria USA operates a Spanish- language network in Houston, New York City and Chicago using FM subcarriers along with an Italian language FM subcarrier also located in New York. Audio streaming of their programming is offered as well from their respective websites. Faclilites and Programming Though WHHN has yet no local studio, its transmitter is located north of Hollidaysburg on the eastern outskirts of Altoona. However, a live program is originated in the Philadelphia area, \\"Don't Give Up\\" presented by Anne McGlone and Anna Iatesta live from Cabry Hall located on the campus of The Malvern Retreat House at St Joseph's-In-The- Hills on Wednesday afternoons at 5pm local time.

Included on the film soundtrack as \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (main title)\\", the instrumental piece was composed by Ennio Morricone, with Bruno Nicolai conducting the orchestra. A cover version by Hugo Montenegro in 1968 was a pop hit in both the U.S. and the U.K.Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications), page 66. It has since become one of the most iconic scores in film history. Ennio Morricone version Ennio Morricone was an Italian composer who created music for hundreds of films. In the 1960s, director Sergio Leone was impressed by a musical arrangement of Morricone's and asked his former schoolmate to compose music for one of his films, A Fistful of Dollars. This led to a collaboration between the two on future Leone films, many of which came to be referred to as \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\". After a steady percussion beat, the theme to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly begins with a two-note melody sounding like the howl of a coyote. Additional sounds follow, some of which symbolize characters and themes from the film. This instrumental composition plays at the beginning of the film. Morricone commented that his frequent collaborator guitarist Bruno Battisti D'Amario was \\"able to conjure up extraordinary sounds with his guitar\\" recording the composition. Largely due to the memorable quality of the main theme, the film's soundtrack peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200 album chart,[ The Good, the Bad and the Ugly soundtrack chart info] AllMusic.com. Retrieved 11 June 2009. and it stayed on this chart for over a year. Hugo Montenegro version Hugo Montenegro was an American composer and orchestra leader who began scoring films in the 1960s. After hearing the music from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, he decided to create a cover version of the theme. Musician Tommy Morgan is quoted in Wesley Hyatt's The Billboard Book of #1 Adult Contemporary Hits as saying that Montenegro's version \\"...was done in one day. I think it was all day one Saturday at RCA.\\" Similar to Morricone's original composition, Montenegro and a few session musicians sought to recreate this record using their own instrumentation. The opening two note segment was played on an ocarina by Art Smith; Morgan provided the sounds that followed on a harmonica. He was quoted as saying: \\"I knew it was live, so I had to do this hand thing, the 'wah-wah-wah' sound.\\" Hyatt's book states that Montenegro himself \\"grunted something which came out like 'rep, rup, rep, rup, rep'\\" between the chorus segments. Other musicians heard on the record include Elliot Fisher (electric violin), Mannie Klein (piccolo trumpet) and Muzzy Marcellino, whose whistling is heard during the recording. Much to the surprise of Montenegro and the musicians who worked with him, this cover of the film theme became a hit single during 1968. It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 1 June 1968, held off the top spot by another song from a film, Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" (from the 1967 film The Graduate).Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 435. It spent three weeks atop the Billboard Easy Listening chart during the same time frame. In September 1968, Montenegro's version reached the UK Singles Chart and began a steady climb, eventually reaching the top of the chart on 16 November and remaining there for four weeks. Other uses Detailing this piece in a description of the film soundtrack, the website CD Universe states that it is \\"so familiar as to be a cultural touchstone. Even an abbreviated sound byte of the theme is enough to conjure images of desolate desert plains, rolling tumbleweeds, and a cowboy-booted figure standing ominously in the distance.\\" It has been used frequently to convey these sorts of images on radio, film and television in the years since the film's release. The Simpsons has used the opening notes of this theme in multiple episodes over the years. Numerous musicians have, in full or in part, borrowed from this piece. Bill Berry, former drummer of the band R.E.M., played what was dubbed an \\"Ennio whistle\\" on the track \\"How the West Was Won and Where It Got Us\\", from their 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi. The American punk rock group Ramones were known to play a recording of this piece at the beginning of their concerts, while at the end of their shows, a snippet of \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" was played. The song was used in Argentinian and Portuguese TV commercials for Camel Cigarettes in 1981.

Zumach (October 16, 1887 – July 1981) was an American Socialist from Milwaukee who served one term (1917–1921) as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate representing the Milwaukee-based 6th Senate district.Members of the Wisconsin Legislature, 1848-1999 Madison: State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, 1999; p. 21  Background  Zumach was born on a farm in Black Creek, Wisconsin but moved with his parents to Milwaukee three years later and attended Milwaukee Public Schools. At the age of 16 he ran away from home and traveled all over the United States and Mexico for three years, working at railroad construction, railroad bridge building, railroad freight transfers, on dredge boats, in logging and turpentine camps; prospected, drove pack trains in mountains; and worked on fruit, grain and hop ranches, and in hotels and factories. He returned to Milwaukee in 1910 and was employed in the engineering department for the City of Milwaukee. In 1913 he was appointed an inspector for the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, and in 1914 was appointed special agent for the U. S. Commission on Industrial Relations to investigate strikes and strike-breaking agencies. After that he became a union organizer, until he was elected to the Senate in 1916.Hunter, Paul F., ed.

Early life Born in Brooklyn, New York, Sellers played high school basketball at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn. He achieved success at the prep level, winning the MVP Award of Pittsburgh's Dapper Dan Tournament at the end of his senior season. He also earned All-America honors at Jefferson and received over 200 scholarship offers from colleges across the country to play basketball. Sellers signed a letter of intent to play at Notre Dame, but worries about managing the tough academics made him reconsider and so he attended Livingston College in New Jersey, a part of Rutgers University specially designed to help students from low-income backgrounds. Rutgers University At Rutgers, Sellers played under then-assistant coach and future college basketball legend Dick Vitale. His decision to become a Scarlet Knight was initially criticized, but Sellers led Rutgers to two NIT berths during his freshman and sophomore seasons and then back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances in his final two seasons. =1975–76 season= Rutgers University's best men's basketball season in school history came during 1975–76. Sellers, a senior and Consensus Second Team All-American, led the team to a 31–0 start. The team finished 31–2, and their only two losses occurred in the national semifinals (to Michigan) and the third-place game (to UCLA). Sellers graduated from Rutgers in 1976 and is still the school's all- time leading scorer (2,399) and rebounder (1,115). On January 16, 1988, he had his jersey number (#12) retired, making him one of only three Scarlet Knights players to have ever been so honored. NBA After graduating, Sellers was picked in the third round (38th overall) of the 1976 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons, but lasted only a year with the Pistons before being put on waivers. He then served as an assistant at Rutgers for three years before moving on to a job with a mortgage banking firm in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Sellers finished his one-year NBA career averaging 4.5 points, 0.9 rebounds and 0.6 assists in 44 games played.

In a move to end the destruction and political chaos, Epiphanius of Salamis amended protective areas for those who choose not to convert to Christianity.

Col. John Beckwith John Charles Beckwith (1789–1862) was a British army officer who was born in Nova Scotia. He is best remembered for being injured in the Battle of Waterloo and for his charity work and philanthropy among the Waldensians of northern Italy.https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov18novauoft#page/n37/mode/2upStephens, H. M. (2004). Beckwith, John Charles (1789–1862), rev. James Lunt. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press.  Career  John Charles Beckwith, known as Charles Beckwith, was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia and was the eldest of ten children. He was the grandson of Major-general John Beckwith and nephew of the generals, Sir George Beckwith and Sir Thomas Sydney Beckwith. He attended the Halifax Grammar School with Captain Herbert Clifford.https://archive.org/details/cihm_22739/page/n45 He left Halifax to join the British army at age 14. Charles Beckwith joined the 50th Regiment of Foot in 1803, exchanging in 1804 into the 95th Rifles, with which regiment he served in the Peninsular campaigns of 1808–10. He was subsequently employed on the staff of the Light Division, and he was repeatedly mentioned in despatches, becoming in 1814 a brevet-major, and after the Battle of Waterloo lieutenant-colonel and C.B. He had four horses shot from under him at the Battle of Waterloo before he lost a leg. Soon afterwards, he became an active reformed Christian but remained a member of the Church of England throughout his life. A fellow passenger noted of Beckwith on a voyage to France: > \\"Major Beckwith was a fine, gentelmanly young high-spirited fellow, the > exact prototype of a rifleman. His unwearied flow of spirits kept us in good > humour during two days and nights in a dead calm, in the middle of the Bay > of Biscay; when the sails and ropes flapped against the masts; and the > vessel rocking from stem to stern incessantly.\\" In 1820, he left active military service. Seven years later, whilst in the library of Apsley House in London, waiting to see the Duke of Wellington, he picked up a book by Prebendary of Durham, William Stephen Gilly about the history of the Protestant Waldensians, also known as the Vaudois, who lived in the Cottian Alps, in north west Italy. The Waldensians had, through skilled military means employed in a few defensible Alpine valleys, maintained their Reformation-type doctrines and championed the principle of freedom of religion since the 14th century in the face of many Papal, Savoyard and French efforts to eradicate them by violence and repression. Having discovered the Waldensian history and their social marginalisation, causing poverty and ignorance, Charles Beckwith consecrated the rest of this life to serve the Waldensians and their faith, both before 1848 when their religious and civil rights were recognised in a new Piedmontese constitution and until he died in 1862, in Val Pellice. Old Burying Ground Charles Beckwith made his home in their main town Torre Pellice. He then used his fortune and overseas contacts to help build 120 schools in the Waldensian valleys, a Waldensian hospital, an elegant church and Waldensian headquarters in Torre Pellice in what is still known as 'the English Quarter'. He worked to strengthen the Waldensian education system and rebuild their ancient missionary zeal to carry the Waldensian faith across Italy. He built the Waldensian Church in Turin and represented them before the Dukes of Savoy in Turin. He was widely regarded as 'a father' to these people and he married a Waldensian believer from the valleys in 1850. A book, published in Italian in 2012, entitled \\"The General of the Valdesi\\" (Waldensians) along with the Waldensian church buildings which still distinguish Torre Pellice reflect the impact that Charles Beckwith had throughout these valleys. He was promoted to colonel in the British army in 1837 and major-general in 1846. In 1848, King Charles Albert made him a knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. Charles Beckwith died on 19 July 1862 at his home in Torre Pellice and is buried in Val Pellice.  References  * Italian book entitled \\"J.

Is a Colombian free-to-air television network with regional coverage, specialized in cultural programming. Being a public television station, it is owned by the Colombian Government and its operations are managed by the RTVC Public Media System. The headquarters of the channel are located in Bogotá. Conceived originally as part of a project to assign a departmental public television channel to the Boyacá department, the channel was officially launched on September 1, 1998 under the name of Teveandina. It was available in Bogotá and 14 other Colombian departments: Amazonas, Arauca, Boyacá, Caquetá, Casanare, Cundinamarca, Guainía, Guaviare, Huila, Meta, Putumayo, Tolima, Vaupés and Vichada. At first, the channel was limited to the broadcasting of programming blocks acquired by third-party companies on their own signal, who rented space to sell their productions. After the inauguration of the first private channels in the country in 1998, the channel went through a great economic crisis due to the fall in the audience that brought the opening of signals. Due to this, several production companies migrated to Caracol and RCN as main clients, so Teveandina started issuing infomercials to keep their signal on air. However, in 2000 the channel declared bankruptcy. But Telecom Colombia (currently Movistar Colombia), the majority shareholder of the channel, contributed 700 million pesos to maintain the company, and the National Television Authority (ANTV) contributed 200 million pesos more to pay the salaries of employees. In 2001 the channel administration was changed, and a new direction was sought for the business, identifying a market niche that until then was neglected by both public and private channels: Young people. With this new approach, the name of Teveandina was changed to Canal Trece, the image was redesigned and a new stage began. In this way, the structure of the canal was redesigned, creating programming for young people, which implied starting to produce in the channel's facilities, something that had not been conceived in its beginnings. In 2004, the management assumed a new administration that has sought to position and consolidate the image through various strategies, among which are adopting the color orange as a distinctive, reducing the percentage of videos and increasing the programming of other types. Special emphasis was given to the commercialization of the channel's programs, so that it became the channel's most important item and together with the production services, it has made the channel sustainable and profitable. With the liquidation of Telecom, Canal Trece became the property of RTVC and the Colombian ministry of telecommunications, since it owns 91% of the shares of the entity and the remaining 9% to the Governments of Boyacá, Caquetá, Casanare, Cundinamarca, Guaviare, Huila, Meta, Putumayo and Tolima.

Overview 3 sections of the Moon House complex are identified by Bloomer (1989Bloomer, William W. Moon House: A Pueblo III Period Cliff Dwelling Complex in Southeastern Utah. Unpublished Master's Thesis. Department of Anthropology, Washington State University. pp. 1-213); M-1, M-2, and M-3. These are discussed briefly. Structures from the M-1 cluster yield tree-ring dates from between 964 and 1267, with most rooms clustering between 1125 and 1250. Structures from the M-2 cluster date from between 1109 and 1268. Structures in the M-3 cluster date from between 1044 and 1266, with most dates between 1150 and 1255. Both Dean and Bloomer postulate different rooms served different functions,Bloomer, William W. Moon House: A Pueblo III Period Cliff Dwelling Complex in Southeastern Utah. Unpublished Master's Thesis. Department of Anthropology, Washington State University. pp. 1-213 and each section of the Moon House complex had a different function. M-1 seems to represent a residential area, with approximately 5 households, while M-2 primarily functioned as a storage area and M-3 as a ceremonial unit dominated by a large kiva. Bloomer found no other kivas within the canyon where Moon House is located, indicating that perhaps Moon House served as a local ceremonial center, servicing the ceremonial needs of the residents nearby in the canyon as well as possibly from the mesa tops. Moon House derives its name from the unique pictographs located within Room I within the M-1 cluster. Controversy In recent years, debate has arisen among hikers that visit the southwest over the location of Moon House. Some hikers have argued that its location, being on public land, should be available to the public. The Bureau of Land Management and some professional archaeologists disagree with this.

Background, career, and scientific contributions  After a first position as teaching assistant at the Technical University of Denmark, and visiting researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, 1988, he became Senior Researcher sponsored by Danish Technical Research Council, 1991. Assistant Professor 1991–1995, and Associate Professor 1995–1996, both at the Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Denmark. He was visiting professor at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K., in 1996, and later Visiting Professor at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, 2003. From 1997–2013 and since 2016 (full) Professor at Automation & Control, Aalborg University, and from 2006–2013, he acted as Head of Research for the Department of Electronic Systems. From 2014 to 2016 he acted as Chief Scientist with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where he led the Control of Complex Systems Initiative. In 2017, Jakob Stoustrup was appointed as pro-dean for the TECH Faculty at Aalborg University. Dr. Stoustrup has been a Member of the Swedish Research Council (Signals and Systems), of the Norwegian Research Council, of the European Research Council and of The Danish Research Council for Technology and Production Sciences. He has acted as associate editor, guest editor, and editorial board member of international journals. At several occasions, Jakob Stoustrup has acted as plenary speaker at international conferences, and he has also acted as a General Chair for such events. Jakob Stoustrup has been appointed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, as Chairman of a Control Systems Society/Robotics & Automation Society Joint Chapter. In 2008, Jakob Stoustrup was elected as Chairman for a Technical Committee of the International Federation of Automatic Control, TC6.4. In 2011, he was appointed as a member of the Technical Board of the International Federation of Automatic Control. Jakob Stoustrup has extensive industrial cooperation, and has been CEO for two technological start-up companies. He has led numerous major research projects based on a high number of research grants and contracts. The main contributions of Jakob Stoustrup have been to robust control theory and to the theory of fault tolerant control systems. In these two areas he has published approximately 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers. In 2009, Jakob Stoustrup proposed a novel research direction in the area of control theory, called plug-and-play control.J. Stoustrup (2009), \\"Plug & play control: Control technology towards new challenges\\", European Journal of Control, 15(3-4):311–330. DOI. As an unusual accomplishment, his work spans the whole range from the development of new theoretical methods to practical industrial applications. In the area of robust control theory, Jakob Stoustrup has in particular contributed to the development of loop transfer recovery methods for the design of H∞ controllersK. Zhou, JC Doyle and K. Glover (1996), Robust And Optimal Control, Prentice Hall, . and to the development of robust design methods for systems having parametric uncertainty descriptions. Loop transfer recovery methods have been among the most popular model based design methods used in industry for decades, due to their intuitive relationships between full state feedback designs and observer based designs. Loop transfer recovery methods were originally designed as an extension to the LQG design methodology, but Jakob Stoustrup and his co-workers advanced the recovery methods to the area of H∞ control, thereby admitting robustness aspects to be included directly in the design paradigm.J. Stoustrup and H.H. Niemann (1993), \\"State space solutions to the H∞/LTR design problem\\", International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, 3:1–45. DOI. Jakob Stoustrup's contributions to the design of robust controllers for systems with parametric uncertainty descriptions have mainly been focusing on establishing methods based on convex optimization. Whereas parametric uncertainty descriptions are often natural candidates for systems with first principle models, because they reflect the variation of physical parameters, the underlying optimization problems often turns out to be non-convex, meaning that they do not readily admit efficient on-line solutions with guaranteed performance. However, in the work of Stoustrup and co-workers, it was described how a class of such problems could be turned into convex optimization problems, and explicit algorithms for efficient solutions were suggested.K. Zhou, P.P. Khargonekar, J. Stoustrup, and H.H. Niemann (1995), \\"Robust performance of systems with structured uncertainties in state space\\", Automatica, 31(2):249–255. DOI. One theoretical result from Stoustrup in the area of robust control states that for a fairly general class of systems, the order of a decentralized H∞ controller tends to infinity as the performance approaches its optimal value, and in fact that not even an infinite-dimensional (causal) controller exists in that case.J. Stoustrup and H.H. Niemann (1999). \\"Dynamical orders of decentralized controllers\\". IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information, 16:299–308. DOI. In the area of fault tolerant control systems, the main contribution of Jakob Stoustrup has been to introduce a number of optimization based methods in order to solve fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control problems. The results include explicit methods for time-varying, non-linear, and uncertain systems for the design of fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control systems. Inspired by his previous work in the area of robust control theory, Jakob Stoustrup and his co-workers has proposed a general architecture for the modeling and design of fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control systems, handling the above-mentioned challenges.H. Niemann and J. Stoustrup (2005), \\"An architecture for fault tolerant controllers\\", International Journal of Control, 78(14):1091–1110, 2005. DOI. One theoretical result by Jakob Stoustrup in the area of fault tolerant control systems provides a positive answer to a previously open problem. By a constructive proof it is established that under mild conditions, a feedback controller for a system with two or more sensors always exists such that the system remains stable if the signal from any one of the sensors disappear. It is also shown, however, that the smallest order of such a controller can be unboundedly large.J. Stoustrup and V.D. Blondel (2004), \\"Fault tolerant control: A simultaneous stabilization result\\", IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 49(2):305–310. DOI. Besides from the theoretical achievements mentioned above, Jakob Stoustrup has accomplished to bring a significant number among the theoretical results to actual industrial practice.

It established itself as one of the pioneer companies of online adult transgender entertainment with its website Grooby Girls, \\"the first transsexual pay site with original content\\". The company owns a number of transsexual adult websites, produces its own DVD line, and has other interests in forums, blogs and social networking in the transsexual niche genre including the Transgender Erotica Awards. Company history Grooby traces its roots to websites started up in 1996. The most prominent of them was his transgender site Shemale Yum which became an Adult Verification site and eventually a pay site. The term \\"shemale\\" is considered pejorative by the transgender community but Grooby says that at the time the site was named he didn't know any better and the site became too well branded to change the name. Other websites followed including Ladyboy-Ladyboy in 1998 which was the first website to go to Thailand to photograph ladyboys and number of other sites featuring Brazilian, Black, Japanese and Canadian transsexuals. For a time Grooby operated the official websites for Joey Silvera and Gia Darling, but because of creative differences these arrangements were dissolved amicably. In 2006 the company celebrated its 10-year anniversary, which included a party thrown by Allanah Starr in New York City. In 2008 Grooby opened the SheMaleJapan.com website to focus on Japanese \\"newhalf\\" (ニューハーフ) transsexual models. The concept for the website dated back to 2000 but it took eight years to find an appropriate producer in Japan. By late 2008 the company hosted 12 websites and employed 7 full-time employees at its Los Angeles headquarters and 25 people worldwide. Grooby Productions produces over 2000 photo/video sets a year for web-only release and about 10 DVD releases. In late 2009, the company relocated its offices from Honolulu to Los Angeles. In August 2017, the company began a year long project to change any of its products still using the term 'shemale' in their branding, with the flagship site 'Shemale Yum' being renamed as 'GroobyGirls.com' and 'Shemale.xxx' to 'Tgirls.xxx'. Marketing director Kristel Penn, was quoted as; “Grooby has been a longstanding ally of the LGBTQ community and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. I’m really excited for this rebrand, especially for our community. Whether you know our company personally or not, I believe people will see this change is a more accurate reflection of our company ethos.” By 2018 the company operates over 35 adult trans paysites and has 50 DVD releases a year. October 2018 saw the release of trans adult performer, Domino Presley's directorial debut 'Domino Presley's House of Whores' as the first of a series, featuring Domino, Natalie Mars, Eddie Wood and the return of Jane Marie. Transgender Erotica Awards Grooby sponsors an annual event, the Transgender Erotica Awards (TEA), held each February in Los Angeles. Citing a poor representation of transgender performers and producers in mainstream adult awards ceremonies, the annual event was created to recognize achievement in the transgender adult industry. It began as a small online-only awards show, and has since grown into a well- attended event, honoring models and performers in 21 categories and attracting attention from outside of the trans community.

Whenever he was in London she would visit his home and record her vocals. The track was inspired by the disco era and describes romantic infatuation using music as a metaphor.

Slutsk, Russia 1843 - d. Pruzhany, 1929), was a leading rabbinic authority of his time. Education Feinstein was born in Slutsk, in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus), in 1843.The Soloveitchik Heritage: A Daughter's Memoir, p.84 In 1851-1852, aged ten years old, he became the pupil of Rabbi Joseph Feimer (\\"Reb Yossele Slutzker\\") in Slutsk. Afterwards he continued his studies at the Volozhin Yeshiva, then led by the Netziv. Rabbinate Feinstein held many rabbinical posts during his life, but always on one condition: that he be free from non-urgent community concerns until noon every day, so he could study Torah uninterrupted. He became rabbi of Starobin in 1863, of Kletsk in 1867, and of Karelitz in 1873. He was then rabbi of Chaslovitz. His final position was as rabbi of Pruzhany. He was called Rabbi Elya Pruzhaner from that time forward. It was in the time that he was rabbi in Pruzhany that he was often called to serve on a Bet Din for Lyakhovichi. Although he received many offers to be Rav of larger cities, he preferred to stay in Pruzhany. The town of Pruzhany was one of four so called \\"Karpes\\" cities in which the Hasidim did not gain a foothold. He was twice offered the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, but each time turned it down. Possible reasons for his declination are the need to find proper suitors for his unwed daughters, or unwillingness to become entangled in the politics of the Holy Land. When this position was instead taken by Abraham Isaac Kook, Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld expressed his regret over Reb Elye's decision. Family Feinstein was married to Guta Davidovitch, a descendant of a long line of rabbis in the town of Kopyl.The Rav: The World of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Volume 1 By Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, page 11. Reb Elye's brothers-in-law included Rabbi Yaakov Kantarovich, and Rabbi David Feinstein, father of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. David Feinstein, Reb Moshe's father, was chosen by Reb Elye as a groom for his sister-in-law, on condition that R. David abandon his Hasidic practices, and agree to study in the Volozhin Yeshiva for four years. Reb Elye's daughters married famous Torah scholars. His oldest daughter married Menachem Krakowski, author of the Avodat ha-Melech on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. His next daughter married Moshe Soloveitchik, father of Joseph B. Soloveitchik. A third daughter married Dovid Feigenbaum who succeeded Reb Elye as rabbi of Pruzhany. Reb Elye's youngest daughter married Eliezer Meisels, grandson of Eliyahu Chaim Meisels, Rabbi of Lodz. Legacy Feinstein dealt with many critical issues facing the Jewish community at the time. He proposed instituting vocational training within the yeshivos, but was unsuccessful. Feinstein's approach to Talmud was influenced by the Vilna Gaon. He sought clear and logical explanations over complicated pilpul. Of his many writings only one part has been published, under the title Halichot Eliyahu. He died on October 31, 1929, and was eulogized throughout the Jewish world.

It was established on September 14, 1965. The current rector is Prof. Dr. Ir. Ellen Joan Kumaat, M.Sc., DEA. History Sam Ratulangi University has evolved from local universities starting as far back as 1954. Pinaesaan University was begun on 1 October 1954 with only the Law Faculty. Then in 1957, Permesta University was started. These two smaller universities were merged to become the University of Manado in 1958, with four faculties: Law, Economics, Letters, and Political Science. In 1961 the Ministry of Education based on Ministerial Decree No.002/Sek/PU, recognized the newly named University of North and Central Sulawesi as a state university with seven faculties: Law, Medicine, Agriculture, Economics, Political Science, Letters and Education. After several changes and re-organizations, the university was renamed Sam Ratulangi University in 1965 based on Presidential Decree No. 277/1965. The new name was in honor of Dr. Gerungan Saul Samuel Jacob Ratulangi, renowned throughout Indonesia, but hailing from Manado, as a leader in education. Initially, Unsrat had only seven faculties: Medicine, Agriculture, Animal Sciences, Law and Public Education, Economics, Political Science, and Engineering. In 1965, the Faculty of Letters which previously had private status was inaugurated into Unsrat. One year later, the Faculty of Fisheries was established in Tahuna. In 1982, the Faculty of Teaching and Education, Manado in Gorontalo switch to Faculty of Teaching and Education Unsrat in Gorontalo (then known as State University of Gorontalo).

Dortch House or the Marlsgate Plantation, is an historic house near Scott, Arkansas. Dortch House is the only plantation home in Arkansas that is fully furnished in the antebellum period style and available for tours and private events. The house and parts of the plantation were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The NRHP listing was increased in 1979 to cover additional building(s) dating from 1888.  History  The original plantation property, totaling 1,600 acres, was a wedding gift to Mr. and Mrs. Dortch by Mrs. Dortch's parents, Thomas and Elizabeth Steele. The first house on the Dortch Plantation was built by the Dortches in 1888. The Dortch Planation eventually expanded to over 7,000 acres with cotton, rice, corn and soy beans under cultivation. Upon the death of her husband Mrs. Dortch divided the property equally among her five sons.  Dortch House  Barn at Dortch Plantation with modern farming implements in the background Built in 1904, the Dortch House was designed by Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson. It was described as one of the finest private residences in Arkansas. The Dortch House has a Neoclassical, Greek Revival design. It features 30 rooms in a total of eleven thousand square feet of living space. On the front portico facing Bearskin Lake, doric columns rise over forty feet in height. The interior features a dramatic double staircase, original beveled glass windows, sliding oak pocket doors, handcrafted woodwork and Carrara marble fireplaces.  Plantation gardens and other buildings  The Dortch plantation complex includes four distinct gardens designed by the Arkansas garden designer P. Allen Smith. Several outbuildings date to the original 1888 farmstead including the carriage house, a well house, a smoke house, stable house, and a pole barn, all of which are included in the National Register designation. The guest house at Dortch is modeled on Farmington Historic Home built in Louisville, Kentucky in 1812 and designed by Thomas Jefferson.  Bearskin lake  The Dortch plantation is situated on Bearksin Lake, an oxbow lake that was originally a channel of the Arkansas River. Located along the Mississippi Flyway, the lake wildlife habitat features a broad range of wildlife including migratory waterfowl, a nesting pair of bald eagles and freshwater fish. The banks of Bearskin Lake also served as an camping ground for Arkansas' Native American cultures, most notably the Plum Bayou Culture (A.D. 650 to 1050) known for constructing Toltec Mounds near Scott. Artifacts collected from the surface of Native American sites by the Dortch and Burrow family members were donated to the Toltec museum in the 1970s and are on display there.

Early life Jeff Butler was born in Madison, Wisconsin on February 26, 1958. He grew up playing sports, \\"But I was always drawing things when I was young. I was a mischievous little boy, and my mother used to stick me in the corner with paper and a pencil and tell me to draw to keep me quiet. Then came the comic books when I was a little older, much to the chagrin of my father. Mom thought the comic books were teaching me to read, but my father, who is a sportswriter for a Madison newspaper, thought they were no good for me.\\" Butler elaborates on his comics pastime, \\"At first, I read all the DC Comics I could get my hands on, and then moved on to Marvel Comics ... I used to practice drawing the figures from the comic books.\\" In high school, Butler continued drawing as well as his sports activities. \\"Oh geez, this is so corny, but I was the football captain who went out with the cheerleading captain.\\" In junior high and high school (at Madison West High School), Butler discovered fantasy through the Conan the Barbarian paperback books, and later Fritz Leiber and Lord of the Rings books. In college, Butler studied sports illustration and did some portrait work, as well as doing some illustrations for newspapers, magazines, and posters on the side, and a Budweiser poster for the university football team. \\"I was a fine arts major in college (University of Wisconsin–Madison), but I ended up splitting my time between the university and Madison Area Technical College (MATC) so I could get some commercial art instruction.\\" Butler played quarterback for the Wisconsin Badgers at university in 1977, but stopped because of a series of concussions.Kassulke, Natasha (June 12, 1997). \\"Local artist serious about comic books\\", Wisconsin State Journal, p. 2.

He interviewed with the company, and was hired in February 1984. \\"When I first came to TSR, the Marvel Super Heroes Game was just starting to roll, so I had lots of fun those first few months doing the kind of comic book art I loved. Now, I like working on the Marvel paintings for the book covers. I can flesh things out and make these characters look real.\\" Butler also worked on black-and-white art for Dungeons & Dragons products and the Dragonlance series, and did color work such as the Conan Role-Playing Game box cover. Butler married his high school sweetheart (the cheerleading captain), Laurel Layman in 1985.

The focal point of the district is the Mississippi County Courthouse, and the block of buildings opposite it on Hale Avenue. Although Osceola was founded in 1875, it was relocated beginning in 1900 to be closer to the railroad, with Hale Avenue as the major east–west route. This began a period of growth in the city which continued through much of the 1920s. Most of buildings on these blocks of Hale Avenue result from this time, and a number of those built later were built in an architecturally sympathetic manner. When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the district included just six buildings on the 200 block of West Hale Avenue. This was expanded to include three buildings on the 100 block of West Hale, and then enlarged to its present size in 2008. This expanded district includes six properties that were individually listed.

The lesser capybara was described as a species in 1912, but later demoted to a subspecies of the capybara (H. hydrochaeris). Following studies of anatonomy and genetics in the mid-1980s, it was recommended that it again should be recognized as a separate species, and this gained more widespread recognition in 1991, although some continue to consider it a subspecies. The lesser capybara closely resembles the capybara, but adults of the former species typically weigh up to about , while adults of the latter species weigh at least and often much more. The lesser capybara breeds year-round, with an average litter size of 3.5. Individuals may be diurnal or nocturnal and solitary or social depending on season, habitat, and hunting pressure. This species is reported to be common in Panama, but rare in Venezuela. It is threatened by subsistence hunting, the destruction of gallery forests, and swamp drainage, specifically that of the Magdalena River. Its karyotype has 2n = 64 and FN = 104, compared to 2n = 66 and FN = 102 for H. hydrochaeris.

His reign is notable for Venetian victories during the War of Gradisca (1617) and for the Bedmar Plot (1618), in which the Spanish ambassador to Venice, Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, was unsuccessful in his plans to destabilize the Most Serene Republic. Background, 1543–1615 Giovanni was the son of Augustine Bembo and Chiara Del Basso. The Bembo's were one of the vecchie, old Venetian noble families. Giovanni Bembo's mother left him with a large inheritance, which he divided with one brother. Bembo enrolled as a crew of a galley at age 12, and he remained aboard ship for sixteen years. He fought in the Battle of Lepanto (1571), showing great courage in spite of being wounded repeatedly. Following his good showing in the Battle of Lepanto, Bembo was appointed provveditore. after which he served with distinction and went on to become savio, consigliere, and subsequently Procurator of St Mark's. Reign as Doge of Venice, 1615–1618 Painting by Domenico Tintoretto depicting Giovanni Bembo kneeling before the personification of the Republic of Venice. Marcantonio Memmothe elected Doge died on 31 October 1615, leaving no obvious choice as a successor as Doge. The old noble families (the vecchie faction) were divided between two candidates as doge, while the new noble families (the nuove faction) were unable to unite behind a candidate. After several rounds of voting, the 41 electors were unable to decide on a candidate, leading to rioting in Venice. Eventually, on 2 December 1615 a compromise was concluded and Bembo, a moderate member of the vecchie faction, was elected as Doge. As always, sumptuous feasts were held to celebrate the occasion. For a number of years, Venice had been harassed by Uskoci pirates, encouraged by Ferdinand, Archduke of Inner Austria, who offered the Uskoci his protection. Bembo's first act as Doge was therefore to declare war on Austria, launching the War of Gradisca (known in German as the Friulian War). This war saw the destruction of the Uskoci. The war took place in Friuli, Gradisca d'Isonzo, Gorizia, and Istria. Venice had the upper hand militarily, with troops under Francesco Erizzo besieging Gradisca d'Isonzo successfully until the arrival of troops commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein arrived, at which point Venice sued for peace, and a peace treaty was signed in Paris on 27 September 1617. 1617-18 saw Alfonso de la Cueva, 1st Marquis of Bedmar, the Spanish Ambassador to Venice, attempted to destabilize Venice by sowing discord, which would allow Spanish troops to march into Venice and seize control of the city. Bembo participated in the councils called to stop the Spanish occupation of the city. But Spain believed to have spies in the city were able counter actions of the council allowing the Spanish forces to stay longer in the city. Unfortunately Bembo died while fighting for the liberation of his city from Spanish occupation on 16 March 1618. References This article is based on this article from Italian Wikipedia.

Hazard Earle Reeves, Jr. (July 6, 1906 – December 23, 1986) was an American pioneer in sound and sound electronics, and introduced magnetic stereophonic sound to motion pictures. He was also the president of over 60 companies, including Cinerama Inc. Early life and education Reeves was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Susan (Perreyclear) and Hazard Earle Reeves. He graduated from Georgia School of Technology in 1928 with a degree in engineering. Early career and war Reeves moved to New York, where his first job was for the Columbia Phonograph Company. After being appointed as a special consultant to the Harvard University Film Foundation, his interests shifted from phonograph recordings to motion picture audio. By 1933, Reeves had set up his own sound recording studio in New York. The studio soon became the largest on the east coast of the US. In 1939, Reeves met Fred Waller during the construction of the 1939 New York World's Fair on an exhibit for Eastman Kodak. Waller showed Reeves his idea for a multiple-camera photography system that would fill the peripheral vision, initially dubbed \\"Vitarama\\". Waller asked Reeves if he could invent a multi-channel system of sound. Reeves agreed, and ultimately invested money into the company. During World War II, Reeves ran the Reeves- Ely Laboratories, manufacturing electronic products for the war effort. His company won the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for merit four times, fulfilling contracts totaling millions of dollars. Later career Following the war, in 1946, Reeves founded the Reeves Soundcraft Corporation and directed the operation of a number of companies manufacturing a variety of products including recording tape and film, record discs, wire cable, television tubes and cameras and precision recording equipment. Reeves introduced magnetic recording to the film industry in 1948. Utilizing separate magnetic film, Reeves created a seven-channel sound systemLS, L, LC, C, RC, R, RS ... five \\"screen\\" channels, separate left and right \\"surround\\" channels for Cinerama, the company of which he was president by 1952. That same year, Cinerama released its first picture, This is Cinerama. Reeves' sound system was the first, discrete stereophonic sound system used in post-war commercial application. (Walt Disney had originally released Fantasia (1940) in three-track optical sound, but the Disney \\"Fantasound\\" system was not used for any other film afterwards.) Reeves Soundcraft Corporation won an Academy Award in 1953 for their development of a process of applying stripes of magnetic oxide to motion picture film for sound recording and reproduction. Reeves died at age 80 of a heart attack in Tuxedo Park, New York. One year after he died, Unitel Video bought the assets of his firm. Reeves was married to Adeline Johnstone Fowles.

The media can be static, such as a banner, logo, lighted sign or sponsorship branding. It can also be dynamic, such as animated lighted signage, skywriting, or audio. Prior to World War II, aviation pioneer Arnold Sidney Butler, the owner and operator of Daniel Webster Airport (New Hampshire) utilizing his fleet of J3 Cubs, created banner towing and was credited with a number of inventions and aircraft modifications used to pick up and release banners. At the start of World War II, the government took over the airstrip for military training. Afterward, Butler moved his aircraft to Florida and formed Circle-A Aviation where he continued his banner towing business. Still today, many of his aircraft remain in service and can be seen in the skies over Miami and Hollywood, Florida. Aerial advertising is effective if a large target audience is gathered near the source of advertising. Balloons, skywriting, and banner towing are usually strategically located. Long-range vehicles such as blimps and flogos can reach a broader audience along their flight route. Secondary distribution such as news media coverage, word of mouth and photos of aerial advertising can reach an extended audience. Due to safety, privacy, and aesthetic reasons, the ability to perform aerial advertising is regulated by local and federal entities throughout the world.  Employment methods  = Mobile billboard = Advertising can be carried on the envelope or livery of the aircraft, or in the case of balloons, the envelope can be constructed into a specific shape to advertise a product. Sky Sign Inc. created, patented and holds various STC's for their aerial LED-based signs. These signs attach to rotorcraft and fixed wing aircraft. = Banner towing = Banner Towing is a form of Skywriting where a banner is towed or dragged behind an aircraft. The banner itself can be of three types: An example of an aircraft-towed banner using standard letters  Standard letters  Banners using standard letters consist of a series of either 5-foot-high or 7 foot-high letters connected together by joints designed for interchangeability. Standard letters have been the predominant form of banner towing for the past decades. 7-foot letters have the advantage of greater readability over a long distance, but incur a large drag penalty on the towing aircraft. 5-foot letters, on the other hand, trade off some readability for the ability of the towing aircraft to tow longer messages. A typical light aircraft is able to tow 25 7-foot letters or 35 5-foot letters. Advantages of standard letters are readability over a large distance and flexibility. The letters being prefabricated means they can be made into messages with very short notice and can be changed easily after each flight.This is an example of an Aircraft Towed Aerial Billboard.  Aerial billboards  Aerial Billboards are a relatively new form of banner towing. They usually consist of a large area of nylon cloth and are similar in weight to a spinnaker on a sailing boat. This blank canvas allows vivid pictures to be digitally printed and towed either behind an aircraft or below a helicopter. Helicopter billboards tend to be square in shape to prevent the top corner sagging and becoming unreadable. Aircraft-towed billboards tend to be rectangular; usually 1 high to 3 long but sizes of 1 high to 4 long are becoming the norm. the main advantage of Aerial Billboards is their visual impact. When banner towing using helicopters, they are much better suited for that use than standard letters are. The disadvantages of aerial billboards are that once painted or printed they cannot be changed as quickly or easily as standard letters. Additionally, they take considerably longer to produce than standard letters.  Logo banners  This form of banner-towing combines Aerial Billboards with Standard Letters to produce a banner that incorporates both types, bringing the \\"blank canvas\\" of aerial billboards together with the flexibility of standard letters. Commonly, an intermediate-sized area of nylon cloth is placed at the front of a banner which is then followed by standard letters. This technique is most often used to advertise a brand, but can also be used as a marriage proposal or party invitation. = Flogos = Flogos (portmanteau of \\"floating“ and \\"logos“) are customizable motifs made out of a stable mass of lighter-than-air soap-based bubbles formed into a specific shape. They are a type of \\"foam balloon\\" suitable for both outdoor and indoor use, and float in the air once released. They are produced by specialized mobile machines which first combine a patented foam fluid with water and helium to make the foam. The generated foam then gets pressed through a stencil which will determine its individual shape. The machines which produce Flogos are produced and sold by Global Special Effects, who also own the Flogos name and specific concept. Flogos are often customized to suit needs and can be any number of shapes, logos, symbols, letters, and words, which is the reason why they are often linked to aerial advertising, or \\"Skyvertising\\". = Sky-writing = Sky-writing by fixed-wing aircraft, combined with the use of a vapor projector, remains popular with major advertisers. It is most effective in brand awareness with short, dramatic messages and occasionally for \\"spectaculars\\" such as marriage proposals. The practice of sky-writing is known to be one of the safest forms of flying, as it is only done in clear skies with smooth air (winds can be strong but smooth) and usually in controlled airspace, where radar separation is provided between planes.

Type of aircraft used = Aerostats = Aerostats are effective carriers of mobile billboards due to their slow speed, long loiter time and inexpensive fuel costs. The first British airship, built by Stanley Spencer in 1902, was funded by an advertisement for baby food carried on its envelope.Duke, Neville and Lanchbery, Edward (1959) The Crowded Sky: an anthology of flight from the beginnings to the age of the guided missile, Cassel (p. 47) Research from the United States suggests that the direct cost of balloon advertising \\"per thousand opportunities to see\\" is lower than for newspapers, posters, radio or television. = Fixed-wing aircraft = The most common type of fixed-wing aircraft used for mobile billboards and aerial advertising are single reciprocating engine aircraft, such as converted crop dusters. While on the ground, operators attach a grapple hook and a towline to the rear of the aircraft. Once in flight, the operator comes back and links the grapple hook to the banner, billboard, or streamer while in flight. The wind resistance created during the natural course of flight causes the banner to stream out behind the aircraft, allowing it to be easily seen by those nearby. Because of the relatively low speed and altitude ceiling of propeller aircraft, this type is generally favored for the deployment of mobile billboards when fixed-wing aircraft are used. All metropolitan areas in the U.S. can be serviced except New York City and Washington, D.C. which have restricted airspace. In the 1950s banner-towing started to become widely used as a cost-effective way of bringing a message to the attention of targeted groups of people. There were very few restrictions, the airspace was not nearly as tightly regulated as today. VFR traffic, meaning aircraft navigating solely by visual reference, could even fly into some major airports without using two-way radio, using special air corridors and getting landing, take- off, and taxi instructions by coloured light signals using an \\"Aldis\\" lamp from the control tower. The Dutch charter airline Martinair, now part of the air-cargo arm of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, was founded in the 1950s by Martin Schroeder, a former Dutch Air force pilot, as a company using tethered balloons and banners. The towing aircraft used were DH 82a Tiger Moth, written off as primary trainers, and the occasional Auster. The company later set up an air charter operation at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport. The first aircraft were a Cessna 172 (PH-MAF) and a De Havilland Dove. Later expansion followed and the company split into the charter company, called \\"Martin's Air Charter\\", later Martinair and the light aircraft division, called \\"Luchtreclame Nederland\\" based at Hilversum Aerodrome. It was later renamed \\"Reclamair\\", moved to Lelystad in the 1970s and expanded into a flying school and restaurant. The previous is to illustrate that aerial advertising was big business then, and could grow into a much bigger operation. A parallel can be found in Germany, where a banner-towing company grew into a much larger operation. At Essen-Muelheim a company called \\"Westdeutsche Luftwerbung Theodor Wuellenkemper KG\\" became \\"WDL Flugdienst\\" with main operations based at Cologne-Bonn. The aircraft: Although there are various types of aircraft suitable for banner-towing they have to have stable flying characteristics, sufficient power to overcome the substantial drag created by a banner streaming behind the aircraft and they must be equipped with a quick-release hook at the tail. Needless to say, they must be approved for towing operations by the civil aviation authorities. In the 1950s Tiger Moths were cheap and dominated the scene in the Netherlands, but the occasional surviving Fieseler Storch was also very suitable. These aircraft now are priceless classics. Current types are Piper PA18 Super Cub, Vilga, Cessna 172 and others like Morane-Saulnier Rallye, Aeronca Champion, etc. Often these aircraft, when not in use for banner-towing, are used for towing gliders. Some crop dusters are equipped with a hook for towing operations. Nowadays we find that many are turboprop, or diesel powered. Even a twin-engine Dornier D28 has been seen towing a banner. For towing, a grapple hook is attached. Mostly it is in the pilot's lap for take-off. It will be thrown out and door or canopy closed. The Super Cub door has a top and bottom half and the pilot could close it after take-off. The C172 door hinges forward. The pilot has to throw the grapnel out of the window, but the 172 often has a second quick-release under the belly. The hook is attached and released after getting airborne. If the pilot makes a mistake, (s)he will only have a line trailing from the aircraft with the grapple hanging under the belly. The only solution is to land, rectify it and take off again, hoping not too many spectators will have noticed. The grapple (or grapnel) resembles a three-pronged anchor. But the prongs are rounded and bent back towards the stock. A subtle but very important detail: It will prevent the grapple digging into the ground in the event that the aircraft makes its run-in a bit low. And it will also reduce the risk of the loop, about which later, slipping off. For the pick-up, the banner will be spread on the ground. There are two main types: One, a large poster. Not seldom 3 or 4 metres square. Often sewn by professional sail makers using pieces of parachute- or spinnaker nylon in different colours. They may represent a tube of toothpaste, a bottle, a company logo. Expensive to manufacture, they are mainly used for long-term contracts. The other type, more often used, is a text, a streamer as a rule made up of interchangeable letters, mainly black and sometimes red if emphasis is required. The various components are: a line with grapple hook as mentioned, a loop attached to a long line, a parachute, a front boom, the actual streamer with the text or visual message and a stabilizing piece of webbing at the end. The stabilizer is necessary for two reasons: the end of the banner tends to flap or wave, making the last bit of the message difficult to read. It also wears more quickly so that the stabilizer also has a sacrificial function, as a piece of webbing is cheaper to replace. The standard text consists of individual, detachable letters. A ground crew will assemble it beforehand. The standard height usually is in the order of 5 feet. This is a compromise because too large means a smaller text – limited by the aircraft manufacturers and copper-fasted by the CAA – and too small means that it will become difficult to read from the ground. Since they are used and re-used they normally are open-type making them stand out against the sky. A white background can get dirty over time. The letters are sown on parallel lines of thin, strong nylon rope. At the front of each letter is a rod of thin, strong and supple steel. The nylon lines at the front are fitted with wooden pegs, at the end the open lines have loops. When assembling a text, the letters are checked for integrity as they come out of storage and laid out on the ground to form the message. When everything is found to be in order, no pegs missing, no wires broken, no tears and the actual text correct without spelling mistakes the letters will be assembled and the webbing at the end attached, as well as a front boom. This is a strong metal rod with loops at the end. There usually are three lines to the actual towing line. The top one is shortest so that the center of gravity will be below the center of the boom. This to ensure that the message will hang vertical. In addition, often the bottom will be fitted with a weight. If, for whatever reason, the aircraft loses the banner or has to jettison it in an emergency, the front boom will tend to fall straight down. For this reason, a parachute is added. Care must be taken of course that it will stream closed in normal flight; if attached the wrong way around it will cause a very high drag. The banner will now be rolled up, brought to the pick-up point, usually in the grass along the runway and unrolled. Again, it will have to be checked. If one of the lines catches and loops itself around one of the rods, the tension not only may result in damage, but also will cause the banner not to hang straight, even twist and roll in the airstream during flight and the message will be unreadable. To the parachute will be attached a tow line and a loop. This loop is draped over two poles, upright in the ground, Sometimes over forks at the top, other operators use a bit of tubing, split to hold the loop just enough so that it will stay up without slipping off at the critical moment. The lines, typically, are in the order of 30–50 feet in length. If there are two aircraft flying in formation, the second one will be fitted with two lines. The second banner will trail further behind the towing aircraft and the texts will not overlap. The position of the poles at the pick-up point can be marked to make them as visible as possible to the pilot. Traffic cones or other markers like a brightly colored cloth held down with a few stones, or pegs, can be useful. An operator will be positioned who can view the approaching aircraft and give instructions, either using bats or via a portable VHF radio. The banner will be laid out away from the poles against the wind direction. Seen from the cockpit, the pilot will see the banner lying behind the poles; having said that, the large square posters are often laid beside the poles. Their construction will cause less risk of friction over the surface than the open and much longer standard banner. The pilot, having released the grapple, approaches the pick-up point parallel to the runway in a long, very shallow descent. The speed will differ according to the type of aircraft. For the Super Cub, it will typically be 60 mph with one notch of flap extended. In a strong wind, the speed can be 10 mph higher. Over the poles, at a signal from the batsman, (s)he will initiate a steep climb, full power, until a jolt confirms that the grapnel has engaged and the banner is lifted off the ground. At this point, the banner will quite literally \\"peel\\" off the surface without dragging. The sudden increase in drag will cause the aircraft to decelerate to below stall speed. The curved flight path will allow this to happen. The pilot will slam the controls forward. Once the banner has lifted off, the aircraft will regain flying speed instantly. It will not be more than about 200 feet off the ground at this time. Cruising speed with a banner usually is at 45–50 mph. The banner will stabilize the aircraft. In flight, the PA18 will need about 2000–2100 rpm. More power will cause a very high increase in drag (for you, pilots: remember 1/2 rho vee square?), a corresponding increase in fuel burn and a gain of perhaps no more than 1 or two mph extra airspeed. The aircraft will cruise, maintaining the flap setting. Again: two reasons. It reduces the stall speed, but it also allows a slightly less nose-up attitude. Meaning: a cooler engine. When the mission is completed, the pilot will return to drop the banner before landing. The drop will be more accurate at as low an altitude as possible. If there is little or no wind, the pilot will fly over the drop-off position – usually the area where the pick-up took place – and pull the release. The banner will fall to the ground, the parachute will open to control the fall of the pole and the aircraft will join the traffic pattern for landing. If there is a strong wind, the pilot may decide to drop at low altitude from a shallow dive. The dive will ensure that the banner, in cruise a few feet lower than the aircraft, will not prematurely touch down. If that happens, a weak link should disconnect the banner from the towing line. If that fails: the Super Cub may end up with the wheels touching the wings as the result of a (very) hard landing. Banner towing has the reputation of being dangerous. In fact, if the pilot takes precautions it is not. The most important precaution is never, ever, to assume that the banner has failed to engage and start a turn to come back for another run – at very low level – too early. With the airspeed suddenly dropping off the clock in a (tight) turn, the banner will not stabilize it and the aircraft will enter a spin from which recovery is not possible. This is the phase of flight that has led to some banner towing pilots losing their lives. On 6th May 2010 British politician Nigel Farage was a passenger in a single-engine light aircraft that crashed whilst towing an election banner. The pilot of the aircraft, a PZL-104 Wilga 35A, had made several attempts to hook the banner from the ground poles and when he finally did there was evidence that the banner towline had wrapped itself around the tailplane elevator. The towline wrap caused the pilot to be unable to control the aircraft and when he attempted to execute an emergency landing the plane, still towing the banner, it crashed landed, the engine broke away and the nose dug in causing the plane to flip over. Both pilot and Farage were seriously injured but recovered in hospital. When coming in too low for the pick-up run, there is a risk that the banner is picked up with the wheels. Especially a tail dragger can be pulled upside-down when landing with the banner. One German operator carried a knife with an extra long handle in every Super Cub, so that the pilot could cut it loose. If not, the best technique is to come in to land approaching slightly high, making certain that the aircraft, at the lowest possible speed, will touch before the banner. With experience, many pilots found that the best way to pick up is not to make the run-in at the height where the ground crew would see the grapple just above the ground. Any turbulence would cause a swing and also could cause the hook to touch the ground. If that happened just before the poles, the grapple would bounce off and over the loop. The best way was to make the approach in a steady, very gentle dive. The pull-up could be initiated about 30 yards or so before the poles. Even if the grapple would be above the actual loop, the pull-up still would result in a decrease in airspeed which, in turn, would allow the momentum of the grapnel to swing a bit lower and engage. By that time, the aircraft would be in a much more gentle climb, already well above the poles and the stall at the top would also be much more under control. Banner towing is no longer practiced as intensively as in the seventies, probably its European heyday. Stricter rules and regulations, especially when flying over urban centers and large assemblies, higher minimum altitudes, in some areas raised from 1000 feet to 2000, which reduces the legibility and impact. Low-flying aircraft are also perceived as a nuisance factor, perceived or real, but all have led to a decline in banner towing activities. In some countries, of course, the climate is not always reliable and the factual occurrence of banner-towing aircraft being caught out in IMC (weather conditions that make flight on instruments necessary if not outright mandatory), all have resulted in banner-towing becoming, if not a thing of the past, certainly becoming a much rarer form of advertising. =Drones= The growing popularity of consumer-grade and industry-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (particularly, quadcopter drones) led several companies to consider the opportunities of commercial application of such devices. For instance, Google and Amazon have plans of using drones as means of delivery, while the Coca-Cola Company, Lakemaid Beer, Paramount Pictures, and Wokker have already used them in a number of advertising campaigns. The cases of advertising- related application include the distribution of branded products, as well as drones carrying banners.Large Format Printed Aerial Advertising BannerBanner towing by parasailing at Crescent Beach = Rotorcraft aircraft = Helicopters are capable of towing very large flags, typically made by joining together many rows of printed fabric to create one image. Typical sizes of these banners are 20,000 sq ft, making them visible for greater distances due to their scale compared to plane banners. Sean Herbert from Australia invented the helicopter banner system in 1993 and got it approved in 1999. It incorporated a weight bag release system that is sewn into the leading edge of the banner, allowing them to fly over populated areas. The system was later improved by Ryan Osbourne (also of Australia) and incorporated video projection technology to display video upon the banners. notably achieving a world record for MTV over the skies of New York. = Kite systems = For centuries kite systems have been employed to fly advertisements. Messages have been on wing covers as well as hung on the tether set of the kite systems. Logos, greetings, purchased advertising messages, political messages, religions celebration symbols, event-marking art, promotional phrases, and flags are frequently flown by kites. Advertising by kites is one of the many kite applications. William A. Eddy was an early pioneer in using kites for advertising. = Parasailing = Parasailing companies make custom banners suitable for towing by the same parachute that would otherwise tow a person. This form of aerial advertising is effective along beaches.  Effectiveness  Modern proponents of aerial advertising hold the position that it is a cost-effective method to reach otherwise isolated pockets of consumers (such as people stuck in rush-hour traffic, or at the beach, where advertising tends to be limited). Aerial advertisements, according to the service providers, give a company the opportunity to target specific customers based on their geographical location and related demographics. The benefits of aerial advertising, banner towing in particular, include a high recall ratehttp://www.airsign.com/pdfs/Case_Study_Effectiveness.pdf and increased engagement with a brand through social media.http://www.airsign.com/pdfs/Case_Study_Social_Reach.pdfhttp://www.airsign.com/pdfs/Case_Study_Social_Media.pdf Detractors of aerial advertising maintain it has a highly limited and ineffective scope in the age of the Internet. In particular, they state that the use of aircraft near two major metropolitan regions (NYC and D.C.) tends to be tightly regulated and restricted, and that, at least in the U.S., the use of aerial advertisement over sporting events with 30,000 or more in attendance is prohibited. Aerial advertising planes do fly before the events over the masses of tailgaters. A 2003 article by the Associated Press reports that aerial advertisement companies had lost a preliminary injunction against new federal security regulations, and all data indicate that the use of civilian fixed-wing aircraft over sporting events in the U.S. is forbidden. Studies by advertisers have shown that mobile billboards carried by aircraft have a limited local exposure but a high consumer recall and retention rate – in other words, customers who see the ad tend to recall the message or product being displayed at a higher rate than with most other forms of advertising, but the region where the advertisement is displayed is limited to the flight path of the aircraft. The reason for this higher retention rate is unclear, but it can be postulated that it is due to the relatively unusual method in which the advertisement is displayed; the novelty of seeing a message in an unfamiliar way helps consumers to remember the message. Viral marketing and stealth marketing are excellent examples of this idea put to work in the modern day. Examples of use Spencer's 1902 airship in flight, showing the advertising for Mellin's Food * Pioneer balloonist and parachutist Stanley Spencer built the first British airship in 1902 with funds from Mellin and Company, the manufacturer of a leading brand of infant formula \\"for babies and invalids\\". The sum of £1,500 was payable in return for twenty five return flights carrying an advertisement for \\"Mellin's Food\\". * The first use of skywriting for advertising was on 30 May 1922, when Cyril Turner, a former Royal Air Force officer, spelt out \\"London Daily Mail\\" in black smoke from an S.E.5a biplane at The Derby. * During the 1994 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, Tom Ridge used aerial advertising along the Jersey Shore, a vacation spot popular with Pennsylvanians.  Risks  There are some inherent dangers involved in the operation of low-altitude manned aircraft. Most of the fixed- wing aerial advertisement accidents that have occurred in the U.S. have been determined by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to be the result of just a few basic causes: * Problems during the pickup/deployment of the banner * Banner tow lines that become tangled or snarled Some of the specific areas of danger include grapple hook deployment errors, and banner pickup errors. If the grapple hook is not released in a satisfactory manner, it can snarl on the tailwheel or in the landing gear itself, fouling the landing and causing an improper landing or a crash event. Once the grapple hook is deployed, the aircraft must approach the banner pickup in a descent using the energy of the shallow dive, and then rotate with application of full power to pick up the banner. However, safety reasons may lead local authorities to consider banning some forms of aerial advertising in populated areas. = Risk mitigation = Modern companies have employed a new, patented, methodology of banner towing that greatly reduces the risks associated with the older, grappling hook method. With the new take-off technique, the pilot no longer has to pick up the banner in the tow hook - a time-consuming and technically demanding manoeuvre. Instead, the pilot can take the banner, already set up for towing, directly from the hangar across the taxiway to the airstrip, and then carry out a normal take-off. A technical innovation makes the ground start possible. Wheels are mounted on both sides of the banner tube system, so the front part of the banner runs on rollers. This counteracts the effect which would otherwise be created between the banner and the ground over which it is towed, sucking the banner downwards.

The métropole came into existence on January 1, 2016 and comprises 131 communes, including the City of Paris, all 123 communes in the surrounding inner-suburban departments of the Petite Couronne (Hauts- de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in two of the outer-suburban departments, including the communes of Argenteuil in Val-d'Oise, and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, the latter of which covers part of Orly Airport. Part of the métropole comprised the Seine department, which existed from 1929 to 1968. Grand Paris covers 814 square kilometers and has a population of 7 million.BANATIC, Périmètre des EPCI à fiscalité propre. Accessed 2017-06-28. The Métropole is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. Its responsibilities include urban planning, housing, and protection of the environment. The Métropole du Grand Paris should not be confused with the Grand Paris Express, a new transportation system being developed independently to connect the Departments in the Paris suburbs. History The idea of Greater Paris was originally proposed by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy as \\"a new global plan for the Paris metropolitan region\\" It first led to a new transportation master plan for the Paris region and to plans to develop several areas around Paris. The \\"Métropole du Grand Paris\\" was defined by the law of 27 January 2014 on the modernization of public territorial action and affirmation of cities as part of Act III of decentralization. The plans were considerably modified in December 2015, and the passage into action in two competences, economic development and protection of the environment, was delayed from 2016 to 2017. The plan was first announced on 17 September 2007 during the inauguration of \\"La Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine\\", when Sarkozy declared his intent to create a \\"new comprehensive development project for Greater Paris\\". The project was organized by the French state, with the Minister of Culture and Communication charged with coordinating the consultation process. In 2008 an international urban and architectural competition for the future development of metropolitan Paris was launched. Ten teams gathering architects, urban planners, geographers, landscape architects will offer their vision for building a Paris metropolis of the 21st century in the post-Kyoto era and make a prospective diagnosis for Paris and its suburbs that will define future developments in Greater Paris for the next 40 years. The architects leading the ten multi- disciplinary teams were: Jean Nouvel, Christian de Portzamparc, Antoine Grumbach, Roland Castro, Yves Lion, Djamel Klouche, Richard Rogers, Bernardo Secchi, Paola Viganò, Finn Geipel, Giulia Andi, and Winy Maas. Early versions of the plan proposed reforms to the local government structure of the Paris region by creating an integrated urban community encompassing the City of Paris and the surrounding Petite Couronne, However, these were largely abandoned due to strong opposition from the socialist Mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, and the socialist head of the Île de France region, Jean-Paul Huchon. Objectives The original plan for the Métropole declared these objectives; \\"The Métropole of Grand Paris is established in order to define and implement metropolitan action to improve the quality of life of its residents, reduce inequalities between regions within it, to develop an urban, social and economic sustainability model, tools to improve attractiveness and competitiveness for the benefit of the entire national territory. The Métropole of Grand Paris is developing a metropolitan project. The residents are associated with its development according to the guidelines determined by the metropolitan council as laid down by the development council. This metropolitan project defines the general guidelines of the policy pursued by the Métropole of Grand Paris. It forms part of the implementation of the overall scheme of the Ile-de-France region. It includes a general, social, economic and environmental analysis of the metropolitan area, the strategic guidelines for the development of the metropolis as well as priority areas for intervention. The Metro project can be developed with the support of the Land and Technical Agency of the Paris Region, the International Workshop on Greater Paris, the Urban Planning Agencies and any other useful body. \\" Transportation Planned metro lines Independently to the process described above, a position of Minister for Le Grand Paris was created and Christian Blanc was appointed to occupy it. Blanc and his team prepared a transportation plan, announced on April 29, 2009. The Île-de-France region had already published its own transportation plan. Later, the architects of the consultation joined together to present a third transportation plan. After much negotiation, a compromise between the national government the Île-de- France regional government was announced in January 2011 and the final plan subsequently approved. The transport plan will be carried out in ten years, at a cost of 35 billion euros funded by the state, local governments and new debt. An important part of the project is a driverless subway linking important business and residential poles such as Versailles and the Charles de Gaulle airport but also banlieues like Montfermeil and Clichy-sous-Bois through a figure-eight track 140 km long and operating 24-hour, which will alone cost 21 billion euros. Another 14 billion euros will be spent in the extension and re-equipment of existing metro, regional and suburban lines. Criticism The way Le Grand Paris has been handled was criticized by the architects themselves, especially by Jean Nouvel who wrote several virulent editorials against the Minister in charge of Le Grand Paris until June 2010, Christian Blanc. Politically, the President of the Île-de-France region, Jean- Paul Huchon and the Mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, both members of the French Socialist Party opposed the initiatives taken by the national government, which they said were in contradiction with the devolution of urban planning matters to local governments. In October 2011, Delanoë stated that the President \\"is trying to claim for himself an urban dynamic begun long ago by the local governments\\". Although Huchon had reached an agreement with the national government earlier in the year on the transportation network, he also declared that Grand Paris \\"is not a generic term to cover everything that is going on on the territory of the Île-de-France region (...) and even less a national certificate created to relabel local policies that were already in existence.\\" Political opposition was also strong from the Green Party, led in the Île-de-France region by Cécile Duflot.

The primary issues involved are the cultural boundaries which is not congruent with the political boundaries being set by the national agencies concerned in setting boundaries. However, the oldest account being set forth by the locals was through the work of Harold Conklin's Ethnographic Atlas of Ifugao (1980) where it states that the total land area of the barangay is 1,450 hectares.  Climate  According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, the municipality of Banaue belongs to the Type III climate of Modified Coronas Classification . The rainy season usually commences in early part of May and ends in November, while the dry season occurs in December and gradually welcoming the rainy season in May. Unfortunately, there is no local PAGASA agrometeorological or sypnotic station present in the barangay, thus, several agencies have gathered independent data gathering methods to further complete the quantitative study in the climate of the said municipality.  People and Culture  The people in the barangay are still devoted with their cultural heritage, myth, and other cultural indoctrinations. There are two dominant tribes and several other tribes known in the barangay. Ayangan and Tuwali being the two dominant tribes. Myth has it that the Ayangans have settled in the area thousands of years ago thereby producing the numerous rice terraces in the region. They are fond of festivities and rituals signifying their willful submission to their supreme deity, Mahnongan. The mumbaki is the priest tasked to deliver, bless, and mediate spirits on different occasions.

The engine was designed in the 1980s to power proposed propfan aircraft such as the Boeing 7J7 and the MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. As of 2019, it is still one of only four different contra-rotating propfan engines to have flown in service or in flight testing. Development The Allison Engine Company, a division of automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM), unveiled its Model 578 contra-rotating propfan engine at the Paris Air Show in mid-1985. The engine represented Allison's attempt to re-enter the commercial airline engine market, because after turboprop aircraft were overtaken in civil aviation in the 1950s and 1960s, Allison was mostly confined to selling military aircraft engines. Targeted to power passenger airliners seating between 100 and 160 passengers, the engine would be based on the core of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which first ran in 1975. The engine would come in two sizes: a variant with a 23:1 compression ratio and a three-stage boost compressor and power turbine added to the T701 core, and a variant with a 33:1 pressure ratio and a four-stage boost and power section. Since Allison estimated that a 100-seat plane required two engines and that a 150-seat plane needed two engines, the two sizes chosen should handle the 100-160 passenger aircraft market. Allison hoped to have its 578 engine ready for flight tests in late 1987. =Joint venture= Allison and United Technologies aircraft engine division Pratt & Whitney announced on March 14, 1986 that they would develop the engine as a joint venture. The agreement, which was signed on February 25, was reached because Pratt & Whitney would not be able to develop its own propfan engine by the planned 1992 certification date of the 7J7, and because it also did not have an engine core in the size range of . Allison would develop the engine and perform ground testing, while Pratt & Whitney would integrate the propulsion system into the aircraft and manage the flight test program. On February 23, 1987 in Detroit, Michigan, Pratt & Whitney and Allison officially formed a joint company named PW–Allison Engines. The new company claimed that compared a commercial jet engine, its propfan engines would consume 30-percent less fuel, require shorter runway lengths during takeoffs and landings, and be quieter (because of the slower propfan rotational speeds enabled by the 578's gearbox). The partnership would last 20 years and cover geared propfan development in the range, though the power range could be increased by fifteen percent with a specific mechanical modification. The new company also expected Japanese and European engine makers to eventually join its program instead of creating competing propfan engines. PW–Allison Engines was to invest at least 500 million dollars to bring the engine into commercial production (depending on airline commitments to buy aircraft using its engines), and it assumed that the new company would take half of the market for new medium-sized airliners over the next ten years—a 13-to-18 billion dollar market, it estimated. Pratt & Whitney would handle the marketing to commercial customers, while Allison would do the marketing to military customers. Other members of the new company included GM subsidiaries Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics and United Technologies subsidiary Hamilton Standard, the propeller manufacturer that invented the propfan concept with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s. An early version of the Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX demonstrator engine, intended to power propfan-powered aircraft such as the Boeing 7J7 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-91. =Boeing 7J7= On December 20, 1985, Boeing and Allison agreed to test its new propfan engine for use on the Boeing 7J7. As of early 1986, Allison maintained that it could have its propfan engine certified by early 1990, although a few months later the company changed the certification target timeline to 1992. By early/mid 1987, Boeing had rejected using the PW–Allison engine for its 7J7. Although Boeing had not tested PW–Allison's propfan in flight, the airframer said that the PW–Allison engine's off-the-shelf core was not powerful enough to power the 150-seat plane. PW–Allison vigorously objected, claiming its engine's gearbox could handle , the agreement between Pratt & Whitney and Allison covered up to , and the gearbox design could go to . The decision became moot in December 1987, when Boeing indefinitely suspended development of the 7J7 aircraft, four months after delaying the 7J7 availability date from 1992 to 1993. =McDonnell Douglas MD-91X/MD-92X= In January 1986, Allison also signed a memorandum of understanding with McDonnell Douglas to perform flight tests on the Allison demonstrator engine, now known as the 578-DX, on an MD-80 testbed in late 1987. The flight test program was in preparation for McDonnell Douglas's ultra-high bypass (UHB) MD-91X derivative, a 114-seat airliner that had a planned service entry in the early 1990s. The demonstrator engine would convert into of thrust. One engine would be built for ground testing, while another would be used in flight tests. The 578-DX would follow in testing the competing General Electric GE36 UDF engine, which was scheduled for 75 hours of flight tests on the MD-80 testbed from May 1987 through August 1987; the 578-DX would complete its 75 hours of flight testing from December 1987 through February 1988. During the middle of each engine's test program, McDonnell Douglas would let airline representatives fly in the testbed aircraft to assess the passenger experience. McDonnell Douglas would begin installing one 578-DX demonstrator on its testbed in September 1987, while PW- Allison would perform ground tests with its other 578-DX demonstrator from mid-June 1987 to November 1987. Ground testing was to begin around August 1987, and PW–Allison was confident that its engine would be flight tested by early December. A number of issues hindered the 578-DX, though. First, there was difficulty in manufacturing the thin, swept blades. Then, after one test engine was disassembled for inspection, the second engine ingested parts of the first engine into its compressor during testing. These problems delayed flight tests until the end of February 1988, and they delayed ground testing of the engine until December 19, 1987. In February 1988, PW–Allison postponed the service entry date until the end of 1993 at the earliest, as it said that the 578-DX was not powerful enough for the MD-92, and the required increase in engine power from could not be finished in time for the McDonnell Douglas's 1992 target date. PW–Allison moved the beginning of flight tests to May 1988, but the flight date target was missed again because of endurance problems from the electrical pitch-change motors, so flight testing was put off until August to October of 1988. Amidst the flight test delays, McDonnell Douglas repeatedly expressed dismay that PW–Allison had not made a formal offer to place its engines into an MD-90 production program. The airframer wanted to offer its proposed derivatives to airlines with a choice of powerplant options, instead of advertising aircraft availability with just the competing GE36 UDF engine. However, PW–Allison refused to submit an offering to McDonnell Douglas and the airlines before its flight tests were completed and evaluated. Ground tests for the 578-DX finished on August 10, 1988 after almost 2,500 hours of runs, resulting in a successful preliminary flight rating test (PFRT), which cleared the way for flight testing. However, the 578-DX could not undergo flight tests until early 1989, because the GE36 demonstrator had been reinstalled on the MD-80 testbed for additional tests. The 578-DX was shipped off for testbed installation on October 18, 1988, and it was installed on the MD-80 testbed in November 1988. The testbed then performed ground runs and taxi tests at Edwards Air Force Base, with the first flight scheduled for January 1989. More delays occurred, though, including one during preparation for a planned March 12, 1989 first flight that was caused by an abrasion on the gearbox's bearing separator. Nearly a year and a half after the flight test was originally planned, the 578-DX engine finally flew on April 13, 1989, with the first five flights being described as performing \\"flawlessly\\" through nearly the whole flight envelope. At the time, the 578-DX demonstration program was planning to conduct 50 hours of flight tests over the upcoming three to four months. The demonstrator covered a flight envelope of up to Mach 0.77 and up to an altitude of , with one flight attaining an indicated airspeed (IAS) of at an altitude of , or over Mach 0.8. However, the 578-DX testbed aircraft ended up flying only through May 1989, making 14 test flights for a total of just 20 hours. Due to the absence of firm propfan orders, McDonnell Douglas announced in May 1989 that the V2500 turbofan engine from International Aero Engines (a multinational engine consortium that included Pratt & Whitney as a member) would be provided as a powerplant option for the MD-90 series. In September 1989, with the order drought continuing, McDonnell Douglas decided to offer the MD-90 series exclusively with the V2500 turbofan engine, ending the airliner sales prospects for the PW–Allison 578-DX propfan. Allison acknowledged that the higher price of its propfan, which some estimated to have a cost of US$4 million (or 40 percent higher than existing turbofan engines), would be unattractive to airline customers at the low fuel prices of the time. It also said that it would not perform any more flight tests of its propfan, preferring to study the data from the flight tests previously done on the MD-80. =Military proposals= Allison's engine was also being examined by the military for airlift and reconnaissance aircraft, and it was offered unsuccessfully for some military aircraft applications. As of early , the Allison 578-D engine was the base powerplant for the Future International Military/Civil Airlifter (FIMA) consortium, which intended to build a replacement military transport aircraft for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the French-German Transall C-160 for American and western European military airfleets. The FIMA engine would be smaller than the demonstrator engine, as its contra-rotating propellers would have only four blades in front and four blades in back, and it would generate . The aircraft would fly at Mach 0.72 and operate from runway strips. Design The propfan engine had coaxial contra-rotating propellers, with the front and back propellers (supplied by Hamilton Standard) each containing six blades of in length. The propellers had a recommended tip speed of , and the engine could support a maximum aircraft flight speed of Mach 0.80–0.82. 44 percent of the engine's torque would be handled by the front propeller, while the other 56 percent would be absorbed by the back propeller. The hot gas exhaust contributes just two to three percent of the total thrust. The 578-DX engine was longer and thinner than the competing GE36 UDF engine. A closeup of the PW–Allison 578-DX propfan demonstrator, installed on the port side of a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 testbed. =Origin= The design adopted many aspects of the Allison 501-M78 single-rotation propfan engine, a single-rotation, powerplant being prepared for flight testing on a Gulfstream II business jet. The 501-M78 was an experimental engine that Allison was developing since 1984 as part of the NASA Propfan Test Assessment (PTA). It was a variant of the Allison T701 heavy lift helicopter turboshaft engine, which produced and was also known as the Allison 501-M62B. The T701 was to power the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 helicopter, but after the XCH-62 was abandoned, the engine technology was redirected in 1976 toward an industrial gas turbine, which debuted in 1979 as the Allison 570-K. The 578-DX was derived from the Allison 571, a variant of the Allison 570 that entered service in 1985. There was much commonality in the participants of both engines: in addition to Allison supplying both of the engine cores, the PTA engine also used propellers designed by Hamilton Standard, and both the 501-M78 and the 578-DX had nacelles built by Rohr Industries. This arrangement facilitated the technology transfer from the 501-M78 to the 578-DX. In addition, the blades and the coaxial propellers on the 578-DX were inspired by the SR-7 single-rotation fan on the 501-M78 and the NASA-studied CRP-X1, a model propfan with a 5x5 blade configuration. =Gearbox= Unlike the GE36, the 578-DX was fairly conventional, having a reduction gearbox between the low-pressure turbine and the propfan blades, which was thought to give a fuel efficiency advantage of seven percent against the GE36, according to McDonnell Douglas. Allison, which developed the gearbox, claimed a fuel savings of ten percent and the elimination of 1,000 turbine blades. The demonstrator engines produced , generating a thrust of . The gearbox would have a reduction ratio of 8.33 to 1, and it would be in service to an airline for 30,000 flight hours (ten years) before requiring a major overhaul, which bettered the mean time between removals (MTBR) of 8,000 flight hours for the Allison T56 turboprop, Allison's top-performing gearbox. The new gearbox, which the propfan developers said had only 15 major parts and was technologically simple, would provide accessory access without having to remove the engine or gearbox, since half of the removals on the T56 historically were caused by failures of accessories. Instead of the six accessory drives used on the T56, the PW-Allison propfan would have no more than two accessory drives. The design was also aided by a study funded by NASA and Allison to develop a contra-rotating gearbox. =Variants= Pratt & Whitney and Allison planned to offer their propfan in three different production models: the 578-D, which produced , climbed at an overall pressure ratio (OPR) of 23.4, and had a combustor exit temperature (CET) of ; the 578-E, a model with a climb OPR of 31.3 and a CET of ; and the 578-F, the most powerful engine at , climbing at OPR 31.3 and with a CET of . The 578-DX demonstrator engine did not completely reflect the design of the planned production models. For example, the 578-DX expels its hot exhaust gases forward of the propfan blades, initially requiring the use of heat-resistant blade materials to withstand the exhaust stream, but the production engine design was modified to release the gases at the back of the engine to prevent the blades from heating up.

The Philadelphia abuses were substantially revealed through a grand jury investigation in 2005. In early 2011, a new grand jury reported extensive new charges of abusive priests active in the archdiocese. In 2012, a guilty plea by priest Edward Avery and the related trial and conviction of Monsignor William Lynn and mistrial on charges against Rev. James J. Brennan followed from the grand jury's investigations. In 2013, Rev. Charles Engelhardt and teacher Bernard Shero were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Lynn was the first official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge and other senior church officials have been extensively criticized for their management of the issue in the archdiocese.

Like the sex scandals in the Archdiocese of Boston, Krol and Bevilacqua transferred accused priests to other parishes throughout the archdiocese. Using records subpoenaed from the archdiocese, the jury examined \\"secret archive\\" files for 169 priests and two deacons. To expose the extent of abuse and a \\"continuous, concerted campaign of cover-up\\", the jury documented 63 examples of abuse and where the abusers were assigned at the times of those attacks. The grand jury also demonstrated that nobody could be prosecuted due to Pennsylvania's statute of limitations and other conditions that protect the archdiocese from being criminally accountable.Grand Jury Report on the Sexual Abuse of Minors by Clergy, by Gwendolyn N.

Cardinal Rigali, in cooperation with District Attorney Abraham and other district attorneys throughout the archdiocese, started the practice of both internal archdiocesan investigations, as well as external criminal investigations. Cardinal Rigali staunchly defended the actions of his two predecessors, Krol and Bevilacqua, when they were named as sponsors of a cover-up by the September 2005, grand jury. =Actions of Bishop Cistone= According to the 2005 investigation, while serving as assistant vicar for administration in 1996, Joseph R. Cistone was involved with silencing a nun who tried to alert parishioners at St. Gabriel parish about abuse by a priest. According to the report, there were several other instances of priest sexual abuse which Cistone was complicit in covering up. The report also indicated that Cistone was most concerned with the public relations ramifications of the sexual abuse. The report also showed that when a sex abuse victim demanded to meet with Cardinal Bevilacqua, Cistone refused the request, saying that allowing a sex abuse victim to meet with the Cardinal would \\"set a precedent.

Cistone expressed unhappiness with how little opportunity he had been given to respond to the report, saying, \\"Unfortunately, the grand jury procedure, as followed in Philadelphia, did not allow for any opportunity to address such questions to offer explanation or clarification.\\" Cistone also expressed surprise that he had not been questioned about the grand jury report during his introductory press conference and told the reporter, \\"Had it come up, I certainly would have addressed it.\\" On June 9, 2009, a group of survivors of clergy abuse protested Cistone's appointment outside the Saginaw Diocese office. Members of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) demanded that Cistone hold a public forum to explain his actions as described in the 2005 grand jury report. SNAP President Barbara Blaine said the actions had to be taken because, \\"the innocence of children was shattered needlessly because of the action and inaction of this bishop.\\" In response to the group's calls for transparency, Cistone said, \\"If someone wants to go back and rehash what the church may have done based on knowledge and experience or lack of experience the church had, well, that's OK, but that's not productive.

John M. McDevitt, a religion teacher at Father Judge High School for Boys, abused Richard Green for six months in 1990 and 1991, according to a report by the New York Post. At the time, the victim's uncle, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor, served as archbishop of New York.Cardinal's nephew says priest abused him, UPI, 2009/06/18. According to abuse survivor accounts, McDevitt also molested children at Camp Brisson, a boys’ summer camp (located in Cecil County, Maryland) which was run by the Oblates of St Francis de Sales. McDevitt's association with the Philadelphia Orphans’ Court, Summerdale Boys’ Club and all male Catholic high schools provided him access to minors. McDevitt used typical grooming techniques to build trust with his targets and victims. McDevitt attempted to create a closer connection with children by going by the moniker “Uncle Jack”. In 2011, the Oblates of St Francis de Sales (the order or priests to which McDevitt belonged) admitted that McDevitt had sexually abused children, as part of a lawsuit settlement in the State of Delaware. In 2018, the Pennsylvania grand jury report on sexual abuse of minors in the Catholic Church included the account of a male who stated that the adult McDevitt attempted to forcibly kiss him while in high school. =Use of the penile plethysmograph= During the abuse scandal, the reliability of the penile plethysmograph was questioned by some officials in the archdiocese of Philadelphia. Later, these officials chose to seek therapy at an institution where the plethysmograph was not used. This, even though the officials were made aware of the fact that the test was used by most experts and was believed to be of value in diagnosing sexual disorders.

On October 7, 2015, a Pennsylvania state Superior Court ruled that two men who claim they were sexually abused by Catholic priests decades ago waited too long to sue the Archdiocese of Philadelphia over the alleged assaults. The Superior Court decision backs an earlier ruling by a Philadelphia judge who dismissed the lawsuits filed against the archdiocese by Francis Finnegan of Delaware County and Philip Gaughan of Delaware. Both men had filed their complaints independently in March 2011, and appealed the initial dismissals to the state court in 2014. Finnegan and Gaughan told the Associated Press in interviews soon after their suits were filed that they wanted to be named to encourage other victims to come forward. The Superior Court opinion, written by President Judge Susan Peikes Gantman, noted that Finnegan, now 54, claimed he was abused repeatedly from 1968 to 1970. Finnegan claimed in his suit that he suppressed the memories of the abuse until 2007. Those memories then came back to him \\"in waves,\\" he claimed and he reported the abuse to the archdiocese's victim assistance program in 2008. Finnegan, who was diagnosed with post- traumatic stress disorder, refused the archdiocese's offers of medical and psychological assistance before filing his suit in Philadelphia County Court, Gantman noted. Gaughan, now 35, claimed he was molested from 1994 to 1997. He reported the abuse to the victim assistance program in 2010, and began counseling at the recommendation of program officials, court filings state. In his suit, Gaughan said he always remembered the abuse, but only recently linked it to his psychological problems, including PTSD. Philadelphia Judge Jacqueline F. Allen dismissed both lawsuits on statute of limitations grounds after the diocese filed motions for summary judgment. In agreeing with that decision, Gantman wrote that Pennsylvania law generally sets a two-year time limit filing lawsuits in childhood sexual abuse cases and does not waive that deadline even for cases involving repressed memories. So Finnegan's deadline to sue would have expired in 1972, Gantman found, while the cut-off for the filing of Gaughan's suit would have expired in 2000, two years after Gaughan turned 18. \\"The fact remains that they knew what was happening and who was doing it when the abuse occurred and should have instituted their (suits) within the prescribed statutes of limitations,\\" the state judge wrote. The Superior Court ruling could be appealed to the state Supreme Court. The priests Finnegan and Gaughan accuse of molesting them are now dead. Both filed their suits soon after a three priests and a high-ranking official of the archdiocese were charged by the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office with failing to protect children from priests who were pedophiles. The defendants in the Finnegan and Gaughan suits included Monsignor William Lynn, who was the secretary for clergy for the archdiocese from 1992 to 2004 and was responsible for investigating reports of sex abuse by priests. Lynn was convicted of child endangerment during a trial in 2012 and was sentenced to 3 to 6 years in prison. He spent nearly 3 of his 3-6 year sentence behind bars before the Superior Court overturned his conviction in 2016.https://whyy.org/articles/msgr-william-lynn-retrial-expected-in-2019/ Lynn, now 64, served his sentence in the state prison at Waymart.http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/10/pa_court_men_waited_too_long_t.html His retrial was ordered to begin in 2019, the year he is expected to retire from his duties as priest. It was later determined that his retrial would start in March 2020, but it was soon delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Brennan, molested him between 1998 and 2001, starting when he was 11, while Brennan served at Resurrection of Our Lord parish.

As the William Lynn trial proceeded in mid-April 2012, The Philadelphia Inquirer led an editorial: \\"Three weeks into a likely months-long landmark clergy sex-abuse trial, a Philadelphia jury already has seen the clear outlines of an alleged cover-up by Archdiocese of Philadelphia officials as far up as Cardinal Anthony J. Bevilacqua.\\" After detailing numerous testimonies of abuse, the editorial continued: \\"Both Lynn and [James] Brennan deny the allegations. Whatever the eventual verdicts, testimony likely will have removed all reasonable doubt as to the cover-up's existence, and the need for reform.\\" Specifically, the paper went on to say: \\"Harrisburg lawmakers need to act on proposals still being fought by the state's Catholic bishops — most vocally by Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput — that would waive civil statutes for a brief period to allow those victims to seek justice. As done in Delaware and California, a so-called \\"civil window\\" would further expose the abusers' dirty secrets and help lead to healing in the church, and beyond. State legislators need not await a jury verdict to do the right thing by abuse victims.\\" Lynn punishment and Chaput actions In July 2012 when Archbishop Chaput's investigation cleared one accused priest, SNAP reacted with sharp criticism of Chaput's procedure, saying decisions were \\"held in secrecy for months or weeks until the archbishop and his public relations staffers deem it's most advantageous to disclose them. Chaput continues to act recklessly and selfishly ... with little or no regard for children's safety.\\" At the same time, SNAP also called \\"again\\" on Archbishop Chaput to proceed to laicize Lynn after his conviction; and for \\"eliminating Pennsylvania's archaic, arbitrary, predator-friendly statutes of limitations\\". In January 2014, the archdiocese, prominently defended by Chaput, posted bail for Lynn.Steele, Allison, \\"Chaput defends posting bail for Lynn: Msgr. William J.

He was returned to serve the balance of his 3-to-6 year term.\\"Bail Revoked, Catholic Church Official Returns to Prison\\", Religion and Ethics Newsweekly, May 1, 2015. Retrieved 2015-05-02. =Events Since April 2014= In July 2014, the cases took another odd turn. The attorneys for Englehardt and Shero filed motions for new trials based on claims of prosecutorial misconduct. They were able to establish that the prosecution attorneys had interviewed Ms.. Judy Cruz-Ransom, a social worker who had interviewed Danny \\"Doe,\\" in the presence of her lawyers. The prosecution did not tell the defense about the interview or about what she said. The defense lawyers said this was a Brady violation because prosecution is required to reveal all exculpatory evidence before trial begins. This denied the defense of an opportunity to support the testimony given by Hagner, the other social worker who had interviewed Danny Doe.. The judge promptly sealed the cases, giving no explanation for why this action was taken. The prosecutors refuse to answer questions about the matter. However, neither the Philadelphia Inquirer not the local media has covered this strange turn of event. In December 2015, the Superior Court set aside Lynn's conviction and ordered a new trial because the trial judge spent so much time hearing about other victims going back to 1948- testify about matters that largely did not involve Lynn. The appeals court ruled that, in admitting the 21 extraneous cases, she had willingly admitted \\"prejudicial evidence.\\" A three member appeals court panel shelved the conviction, and in February, 2016, the full court backed the decision of the panel. The Philadelphia County prosecutors appealed that decision to the State Supreme Court. Judge Theresa Sarmina, still the presiding judge of record, ruled that Lynn was a flight risk and must remain in Graterford prison until the State Supreme Court renders a decision. On July 26, 2016, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected the appeal of District Attorney Williams. The court ruled that Lynn must be retried. In August 2017, the district attorney announced that he would retry Lynn in 2017. Though Lynn, then stood un-convicted, it was first proposed that he remain in prison until early October, when a parole board had earlier ruled he could be released. In the end, however, the court decided to release him on August 4 under $250, 000 bond. He had served 33 months in prison and 18 months of house arrest. The latter did not count toward time-served. In late March 2017 Judge Gwendolyn N. Bright struck down Lynn's claims that prosecutorial misconduct should be grounds to prevent a new trial. The defense had earlier shown that the prosecution did not inform it of a witness who had exculpatory evidence. It was believed that this new case involved a social worker, but it turned out to be a retired police detective, Joseph Walsh, who had been brought back to question the main witness, \\"Danny Doe\\" or \\"Danny Gallagher,\\" a twenty-three- year-old man. . Walsh picked apart the claims of Gallagher and was told by an angry prosecutor was told he was destroying the prosecution case. Bright ruled that concealing the Walsh evidence was not \\"intentional\\" prosecutorial misconduct. She gave the defense 30 days to file an appeal. Msgr. Lynn's attorneys said there would be an appeal, and it will probably delay his retrial. In 2016, Newsweek obtained a psychiatric report on Danny Gallagher, the alleged victim, that he admitted not giving his medical personnel accurate information about his medical and personal history. He also admitted that he had provided others with unreliable information regarding claims of sexual abuse. Though his story repeatedly changed, and he eventually disavowed most of the most lurid claims, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia eventually decided to end his case against it by paying Danny Gallaher something in the neighborhood of $5 million. The Philadelphia Inquirer, which played a large role in supporting the prosecution, opted not to comment on the Newsweek revelations. By then much of the Grand Jury material had become public, as well as police and medical reports on the main witness. Eventually it even came out that Danny Doe told dramatically conflicting stories, and the more dramatic and fantastic of them became public. In August 2017 parochial school teacher Bernard Shero's conviction was overturned in a Post-Conviction Relief Act case because Judge Ellen Ceisler found prosecutorial misconduct in that the prosecutors did not tell the defense attorneys that Detective Joe Walsh had grave questions about Danny Gallagher's truthfulness. Shero had served four and a half years of a sixteen-year sentence. Shero had to assent to a lesser plea to justify time served and avoid a new trial. He also had to agree that Walsh not be called to the stand. However, Walsh had provided a 12-page affidavit with the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. Walsh was called out of retirement to work on the case, but what he was expected to do was hotly contested. The prosecutors said Walsh was only to coach Danny Gallagher so he could testify effectively. Walsh said he was expected to investigate, and he conducted 35 to 40 interviews and found nine factual discrepancies. Twenty one of the interviews were conducted at St. Jerome parish and school. Walsh concluded that Danny was lying. For example, Danny said Father Avery first contacted him when he was working on the fifth grade bell team. Fifth grade boys did not have that duty as they were not strong enough for that duty. That was the work of eighth grade boys. Danny said Avery molested him after Avery presided at a July 1999 funeral. Avery had no funeral at that time. Danny offered dramatically different stories about how the two priests abused him. Then he said he made up the first stories and offered tales that were not so fantastic. The prosecutors never revealed that Gallagher offered different stories. Walsh obtained evidence from Danny's older brother that destroyed his claims against Fr. Engelhardt. Walsh repeatedly informed ADA Maruana Sorensen of his findings. She repeatedly said she believed everything Gallagher said. On March 12, 2020, jury selection in Lynn's retrial was ordered to start on March 16, 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced his retrial to be delayed until January 2021. Investigations in other Pennsylvania dioceses There have been a number of investigations of abuse in the seven other dioceses in Pennsylvania.

Origins MeenkulathikkavuPallassana Pazhayakavu website is the oldest temple in Pallasena. Tradition has it that centuries ago three families belonging to the Veerasaiva Mannadiar clan worshipped the goddess Meenakshi as their deity. An acute drought in Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu) drove them to seek greener pastures. One of them took a stone from there along with their other possessions. Worshipping their stone as their friend, philosopher and guide, they trekked to several places before reaching Pallasena. Enchanted by the forests surrounding the villages they settled there and prospered in the diamond trade. Whenever they went on business, they offered their customary prayers to the family deity. An aged member of their clan went for his customary bath before leaving on a trip home. He left his valuables and a palm leaf umbrella in the care of two youths. When he came back, he was shocked when he could not lift the things he had left with the youths. An astrologer said that Meenakshi had manifested herself under the umbrella and that was why it could not be moved. Huge crowds came there to witness the miracle. The place came to be known as Kudamannu. The present Meenakshi temple and the adjacent temple tank were constructed over the next four centuries. A Thirumandiram was written as a testimony to the event. The Mannadiar clan has grown into 110 manais (veedus) . They conduct Navarathri, Pongal and Bhairava festivals. Buildings The structure is built in the Kerala style. It is constructed in such a way that the shadow of the wall never falls on the ground. There are two entrances, one in the north and the other in the west. The temple tank is next to the western entrance. Crossing the Dwajasthambam made of teakwood and covered with copper. The garbhagriha contains a large idol of Meenakshi Amman. Devotees are not allowed to wander around the garbhagriha. Around the main idol, the saptha maathas (several female deities - Brahmi, Maheswari, Kaumari, Vaishnavai, Indrani, Chamundi and Varahi) are installed. There are separate shrines for Ganapathi, Veerabhadra, Durga, Shiva, Bhairava, Brahma Rakshasas and Ayyappa. In the adjacent hill called Vamala there are shrines for Muruga, Ganapathi, Siva, and Shasta. Events Navarathri, Karthigai, Mandala Vilakku, Maasi Thiruvizha, Pallivettai and Bhairava Pooja are the most celebrated events in the temple. The eight-day maasi festival includes Ottamthullal and Kathakali programs depicting scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is customary that the deity's sword and lamp are taken in procession by the descendants of the youths who stood guard over the valuables and the palm leaf umbrella. Though the Mannadiar clan is given a privileged place in the activities of the temple, members of the entire community participate in the conduct of the temple festivals. The unique structure of the temple and its mode of worship have gained immense popularity among the natives of the village. Devotees firmly believe that the bath in the tank (known for its abundant fish) rids one of all chronic ailments.

His family lived in Santurce where Carrión, who was one of five siblings, was born. The family sustained themselves economically by selling water in containers. In 1896, Carrión's mother died of typhoid fever and the family moved to the City of Caguas.\\"Tradition into the Future: The First Century of the Banco Popular De Puerto Rico 1893-1993\\"; By: Guillermo A.

Carrión Santiago in the City of Arecibo. His brother was a businessman who kept the accounting records of many of the local businesses. Carrión was then able to attend the Americanized public school system which taught in English and where he would learn the language. In 1902, Carrión moved to San Juan and lived with his sister. He quit school in the eighth grade and worked for various firms until he finally found a job at Lomba & Cia, an importer of goods from the United States and Europe. When the owners of the firm became aware of Carrión's English-language proficiency, they put him charge of transactions made in that language. Carrión quit his job and went to New York City where he found a job with E.G. Perez & Cia. In 1909, his former employer from Lomba & Cia wrote to him and recommended that he study finances because they were planning in opening a branch in that city. After a short stay in New York, Carrión returned to Puerto Rico and went to work for his brother once more, this time as a salesperson. His brother's business, located in San Juan, represented the Baldwin Locomotive Company and was successful. Unfortunately his brother fell ill, died within one year, and Carrión took charge of the business. The Baldwin Company helped Carrión by enrolling him in commercial courses, and by making him their representative in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. In 1911, he married Ernestina Ruiz with whom he fathered eight children. Over the years Carrión invested in sugar, real estate and other industries. As a result, he had dealings with the American Colonial Bank in Puerto Rico, who invited Carrión to purchase some of its stock. Carrión became interested in banking and soon thought about purchasing a local bank. Beginning of the Carrión dynasty Banco Popular de Puerto Rico can trace its roots to 1893, when Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony. That year, fifty-two stockholders provided the initial capital to establish the Sociedad Anonima de Economias y Prestamos ( The Anonymous Savings & Loan Society), a savings bank for the poor.Company History However the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War in 1898, and the island was annexed by the U.S. under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which was ratified on December 10, 1898. Almost immediately, the United States began the \\"Americanization\\" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economic and political life. Amongst the many industries appropriated and controlled by the U.S. Government, were Puerto Rico's financial and banking institutions.Areas Controlled by the United States In 1913, the United States Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act which created The Federal Reserve System. All national banks were required to join the system and Congress created Federal Reserve notes to provide the nation with an elastic supply of currency. The notes were to be issued to Federal Reserve Banks for subsequent transmittal to banking institutions in accordance with the needs of the public.Woodrow Wolson As a consequence of the new rules and regulations, the Sociedad Anonima de Economias y Prestamos ceased operations. In 1923 Carrión and his older brother, together with some of the former members of the Sociedad Anonima, organized and founded the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, a commercial bank (rather than a savings bank, in which Carrión served as Executive Vice President. Four years later in 1927, Carrión became the majority stockholder of the bank, its president, and CEO. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico Art Deco \\"BPPR\\" Headquarters Building Carrión presided and led the bank until 1956. Under his leadership the bank established its first physical branch in 1934. In its first year the bank provided personal loans without requiring collateral. This made the bank enormously popular (in accordance with its name) and, by 1954, the bank had 20 branches in different parts of the island. This represented a growth rate of one new Banco Popular branch for every year of its existence, between 1934 and 1954. Given the challenges of the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean War, this success and growth rate was astounding. During the Great Depression, the bank survived while others failed. In 1930, Banco Popular purchased the oldest and most respected banking institution on the island, the Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico. With a total of $8.82 million in deposits in 1937, Banco Popular became the largest bank in Puerto Rico. In 1938, it became the first bank in Puerto Rico to offer FHA mortgage loans. In 1939, Carrión completed the construction of an Art Deco headquarters for the bank, on Tetuán Street in Old San Juan. Carrión was a stock holder in the Continental Bank of New York and when that institution merged with Chemical Bank & Trust Co. in 1948, he became a member of Chemical's Board of Directors. He retired in 1956 and the leadership positions were occupied by his sons Rafael Jr. and Joe Carrión. In 1990, his grandson (son of Rafael Jr.) Richard Carrión was named Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Bank, Popular North America, Inc. and Subsidiaries.Puerto Rico Herald Legacy Popular, Inc. headquarters During his lifetime, Carrión was able to witness the growth of the bank which he co- founded from a small local bank with one branch in 1934, to the largest bank in Puerto Rico with two additional branches in New York City - one in the Bronx and another in Manhattan. Rafael Carrión Pacheco, died on March 26, 1964, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Since his death, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico has grown into a multinational banking and financial institution with 302 bank branches and 382 non-bank offices. It is the 35th largest bank holding company in the United States, and the largest Hispanic-owned bank in the United States. Of the company's 302 banking branches, 199 are in Puerto Rico, 95 in the continental United States, and 8 in the Virgin Islands.

It was used during the 10th–12th century by the Khitan people, who had created the Liao Empire in north-eastern China. In addition to the small script, the Khitans simultaneously also used a functionally independent writing system known as the Khitan large script. Both Khitan scripts continued to be in use to some extent by the Jurchens for several decades after the fall of the Liao Dynasty, until the Jurchens fully switched to a script of their own. Examples of the scripts appeared most often on epitaphs and monuments, although other fragments sometimes surface. History The Khitan small script was invented in about 924 or 925 CE by a scholar named Yelü Diela. He drew his inspiration from “the Uyghur language and script,” which he was shown by a visiting Uyghur ambassador at the Khitan court. For this reason, Khitan small script was originally thought to be a daughter script of the Old Uyghur alphabet. Description Using a smaller number of symbols than large script, small script was less complex, yet still \\"able to record any word.\\" While small- script inscriptions employed some logograms as well, most words in small script were made using a blocked system reminiscent of the later Hangul writing of Korea, meaning that a word is represented by one group (square block) composed of several glyphs with individual phonetic meanings (somewhat similar to the jamo units of Hangul). Unlike Hangul's jamo, a Khitan phonetic symbol could represent not just a single vowel or consonant, but a consonant- vowel or vowel-consonant pair as well.Kane (1989), p. 15. Each block could incorporate two to seven such \\"phonetic element\\" characters, written in pairs within the block, with the first half of the pair on the left. If there were an odd number of characters in a block, the unpaired character would be centered below the preceding pair. Although there is some speculation, it appears there are no characters that both the small and large scripts share. Periodically, epitaphs written using small script will be written using the large script method of linearity. Although small script had some similarities to Chinese, Khitan characters were often used to record Chinese words. The appearance of a likeness between a small script and a Chinese character does not help in the reading of Khitan. For example, the Chinese character for 'mountain' (山) is the same as the Khitan small script logogram for 'gold' (and, thus, the name of the Jin dynasty).Kane (1989), p. 17 Of the 378 known small script characters, 125 are semantic, 115 are phonetic, and the remainder have not been deciphered. (Usually, it was possible to guess the phonetic value of an element if it has been used to transcribe a Chinese loanword in a Khitan inscription; otherwise, such phonetic values are hard to determine, as very little of the Khitan language is known.Kane (1989), p. 16) Small script uses a mixture of logograms, syllabograms, and, as some as sources claim, a few single sound phonograms. Sometimes suffixes were written with syllabograms, just as single syllables sometimes were written with three syllabograms (with one each for the initial, medial, and final sounds of the syllable). Sometimes the initial consonants of syllables are indicated to be dental, labial, guttural, or nasal etc., based on the syllabograms involved. Additionally, vowels are sometimes indicated to be labial or non-labial, or pronounced in the front or back of the mouth. Much of this information came from the \\"Khitan Script Research Group\\", led by the Mongolian scholar named Činggeltei, who used monuments, calendar, and similar Chinese texts to decipher sections of small script.According to Kane (1989) (p. 13), the most complete publication on the Khitan small script as of that time was the book by Činggeltei et al. (1985). It contained the complete corpus of inscriptions in that script known to date, summary of research done on the subject in China and elsewhere, and a complete bibliography. A particularly valuable object of their study was the inscription on the Da Jin huangdi dotong jinglüe langjun xingji (大金皇帝都統經略郎君行記) stele, which is the only known bilingual Chinese-Khitan inscription. Produced during the Jurchen Jin Dynasty it, ironically, was originally (before the discovery of other Khitan inscriptions in 1922) thought to be in Jurchen.Kane (1989), pp. 4-5, 13-20  Corpus  Bronze 'fish tally' with small Khitan inscription owned by Stephen Wootton Bushell There are no surviving examples of printed texts in the Khitan language, and aside from five example Khitan large characters with Chinese glosses in a book on calligraphy written by Tao Zongyi (陶宗儀) during the mid 14th century, there are no Chinese glossaries or dictionaries of Khitan. The main source of Khitan texts are monumental inscriptions, mostly comprising memorial tablets buried in the tombs of Khitan nobility. There are about 33 known monuments with inscriptions in the Khitan small script, ranging in date from 1053 to 1171. Encoding The Khitan small script was added to Unicode version 13.0 in March 2020. 470 graphic characters are located in the Khitan Small Script block, while a single invisible filler character () is located in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block. The filler is inserted following the first character of a cluster, and denotes a character cluster laid out with one character on the first line, as opposed to the usual two.

In the beginning of his career in the 1960s, he was a pioneer in Polaroid art and Video art. Biography In 1977, there were two simultaneous exhibition in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht, in the Netherlands, with mainly conceptual work. He is a conceptual artist with respect in Europe. In that time, the Dutch Ger van Elk and Jan Dibbets are also important as European conceptual artists and Joseph Kosuth is a big name in New York City. From the mid-1970s Danny Matthys created the development of artistic training at the Urban Arts Institute in Ghent. Given the many winners in several national art competitions it was quite valued. His partner there was Eric De Volder, a locally very famous Flemish experimental theater maker. It was a successful educational experiment that was closely linked to the brand new Flemish Ministry of Culture and Flemish Affairs, a forerunner of the current Flemish Culture Ministry. From the 1980s, Matthys uses more traditional techniques. Assemblage (art) on the basis of strange antique photo series, collage photo mozaiec and oil painting do their entry in his oeuvre. =Australia= In the late 1980s, Matthys made several trips to Australia. He has seriously considered emigrating. He has had exhibitions in, among others, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, together with the starting up Wim Delvoye and created projects with the Australian film - composer Peter Best (composer). He has also worked on the old and the new art of Indigenous Australians. He shares experience with Flemish - Belgian dr. Georges Petitjean, who as curator of the Museum of contemporary Aboriginal art in Utrecht (city), (Netherlands) curated a number of exhibitions in which Indigenous Australian and European art were included. However, several serious setbacks in the private atmosphere forced Danny Matthys finally to return to Europe. =Art Trip= He later reworks his former collage and even Polaroid art - series with a very personal pointillist technique, in which he has owned several old and modern aboriginal - techniques. Since the early 1990s, he started with what is still best described as Mosaic or monumental 'tile fragments-Mosaic'. This process also makes a connection with his older monumental photo - collage - work and his more recent pointilistic method. It gives a strong sense of indestructible timelessness. His early video from the 1960s and early 1970s was restored and better protected from the ravages of time by Argos Foundation in Brussels, with the support of the Flemish Community =Curriculum= His work is part of several museum collections such as the Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp and many private collections in Europe and abroad. Danny Matthys is today a major name in the Flemish \\"Art - lending \\" project. Matthys discontinued a few years ago a rich career as a lecturer in art education. He was co-founder and professor of the Department Mixed Media within the KASK (art academy) of Hogeschool Gent. On the left front of the SMAK in Ghent is a huge work of him, made up of dozens of life-sized busts in pigmented concrete that is quite indestructible fixed in front of the famous museum. The work was previously conceived in an impressive horizontal drafting. Founding SMAK Director and Curator of Documenta IX in Kassel in 1992.Jan Hoet wanted ultimately to hang it on the museum left frontwall. =Documenta 14= His well-known conceptual photo work 'Brabantdam 59, Downstairs-Upstairs' of 1975, part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art Antwerp M HKA, was loaned for a long term at the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens (EMST) and was selected for the Fridericianum during the Documenta 14 2017 in the German Kassel. Documenta is the most important international contemporary art manifestation worldwide. =Sports, Study and Training= In his youth, Matthys was a gifted cyclist in the category of ’promises’, together with André Dierickx, which later won famous classics such as the La Flèche Wallonne, but a very serious accident during the last years of his humanities studies in Ghent and a long rehabilitation, gave his life a strong new direction. Matthys first studied Textile Design at the Hogeschool Gent and then at both of the School of Arts and Architecture and the Hogeschool Gent completed higher art formation and training in the monumental arts. Famous names from his professional relations are Hugo Debaere(† 1994), Roger Raveel, Marthe Wery, Jan Vercruysse, Jan Fabre, Joseph Beuys(† 1986) and Nick Ervinck.

Two of the three statues of goddess Kannon it enshrines are Important Cultural Properties. Sugimotodera is nicknamed Geba Kannon (\\"Dismount Kannon\\"), because horsemen never failed to dismount from their steeds when they passed by. (According to a different version of the legend, non-believers always fell from their horse when passing in front of the temple.)Mutsu (1995:48) The temple is a of Hōkai-ji.Shirai (1976:171)  History  The Main Hall (Kannon-dō)According to the temple's own records, Sugimoto-dera was founded in 734 by the minister of the Imperial Court Fujiwara no Fusasaki (681 – 737) and priest Gyōki on orders by Emperor Shōmu. The temple's legend holds that Empress Komyo (701–760) in the Nara Period (710–794) instructed Fujiwara and Gyoki (668–749) to build the temple enshrining a statue of Eleven-Headed Kannon as the main object of worship. It is therefore considered to be the oldest of Kamakura's temples, predating the Kakamura shogunate by half a millennium.Kamakura Shōkō Kaigijo (2008:85) The records say that in the 8th century priest Gyōki was crossing the Kantō region on foot when he saw Kamakura from Mount Taizō (the Taizōzan in the temple's name) and decided to leave there a statue of goddess Kannon. He then carved and enshrined it himself. Later in 734,6th year of the Tenpyō era. Emperor Shōmu was told by the goddess herself to build here a temple (the Hon-dō). In 851, the temple was visited by Ennin (794–864), who made a new Eleven-Headed Kannon statue and gave it to the Temple. Again in 985, retired Emperor Kazan (968-1008) told the priest Eshin Sōzu Genshin (942-1017) to carve an additional statue of Eleven-Headed Kannon and enshrine it in the temple. This event made the temple surge to the number one temple in the Bandō Sanjūsankasho pilgrimage circuit, a series of 33 Buddhist temples in Eastern Japan sacred to Goddess Kannon. Historical accounts of the temple are rare, remaining most of its past largely unknown. Sugimoto-dera certainly predates the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and is therefore, if not the oldest, among the oldest temples in Kamakura. The Azuma Kagami calls it \\"Ōkura Kannondō\\", or \\"Ōkura Kannon Hall\\", from the old name of the area where it stands. The temple was visited in 1191 by Shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo, who ordered extensive repairs. In 1337, well after the fall of the shogunate in 1333, there was a battle in the temple's premises between Hōjō supporters and Ashikaga forces, and more than 300 samurai lost their lives. The many small gorintō (stone stupas) to the right of the main hall were laid there in memory of those who fell on that occasion. The history of the temple during the Muromachi period is unfortunately not known.  Points of interest  The Niō at the gate are supposed to be works by Unkei.The three sitting statues of Kannon that the Main Hall enshrines are the temple's main object of worship. The statue on the left is supposedly the one Gyōki built, but it appears to belong rather to the late Heian period (from 794 to 1185). In spite of its dubious attribution, the statue is a city Important Cultural Asset. The one in the middle is the statue said to have been made by Ennin, which also seems to go back only to the late Heian period and is a national Important Cultural Asset. The one on the right is the statue traditionally attributed to Genshin, which has been dated to the middle of the Kamakura period and is far too young to really be by him. This work too is a national Important Cultural Asset. Religious tradition notwithstanding, none of the statues seems therefore to be attributable to its supposed author. One evening in 1189 a fire destroyed the entire Ōkura Kannondō, but the temple's bettō, a man called Jōdai-bō, jumped into the fire and rescued the three statues, laying them under a cedar tree. From this episode stems the present name of the temple, which literally means \\"Under the cedar tree\\". The rescue was deemed miraculous, and greatly increased the temple's reputation and the number of its pilgrims. The story was later further embellished claiming that the statues repaired under the tree unaided, and simply were found under the tree. Finally, the two warriors at the Niō gate (the Niōmon, see photo), are attributed by the temple to famous sculptor Unkei, but the claim is not supported by any evidence.

Dr. Wessen has been an employee of the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory since 1984. He is currently the A-Team Lead Study Architect for JPL's Innovation Foundry. On the side, Wessen works with Dr. David Porter of Chapman University in the field of Experimental Economics, where they are designing a system to help allocate resources for building instruments on robotic deep space planetary spacecraft. This proposed system will build on the success of the Cassini Resource Exchange and be applied to NASA's Outer Planet Flagship Missions.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory  This is the orbital diagram for asteroid 31664Randiiwessen showing its location on 2011 April 22. Wessen's first job at JPL was as the Voyager Science Sequence Coordinator for the Uranus and Neptune encounters. He helped coordinate science observation requests submitted by the eleven different Principal Investigators. These requests were integrated into one large sequence of events. These sequences of events were transmitted up to the Voyager spacecraft, executed as a series of encounter activities at the planet, and then transmitted back down to Earth as scientific data. Results were produced into charts, graphs, images, and videos, most of which had never been seen by individuals outside of the space program. He was most proud of personally building the post-encounter sequences for Neptune. It was this effort that earned him NASA's Exceptional Service Medal. From there he moved on to the Cassini Program which was building a spacecraft destined for Saturn. On Cassini he moved from science to system engineering. After eight years he then changed focus and became the Telecommunications & Mission Systems Manager for the Mars Program. He worked as an intermediary between the many Mars spacecraft in both development and operations and the Deep Space Network to ensure communication between them. This work included activity with the Mars Global Surveyor, the 2001 Mars Odyssey, European Space Agency's Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and most famously the Mars Exploration Rovers. Wessen then moved to the Navigator Program as its Program System Engineer dealing with the search of Earth-like planets around other stars. This program had two ground-based projects (the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer and the Michelson Science Center) and three space borne projects (the Space Interferometry Mission, the Terrestrial Planet Finder – Coronagraph, and the Terrestrial Planet Finder – Interferometer). Wessen is currently the A-Team Lead Study Architect for JPL's Innovation Foundry. This position involves leading a team of scientists and engineers with idea generation for future mission concepts, feasibility studies of these new concepts, and trade space exploration to make sure that the mission concept going forward is the best one possible within constraints.

It constitutes one of the most bitter chemical agents responsible for Absinthe's distinct taste. The compound shows biological activity and has shown promise as an anti-inflammatory agent, and should not to be confused with thujone, a neurotoxin also found in Artemisia absinthium. Chemical Structure Absinthin's (1) complex structure is classified as a sesquiterpene lactone, meaning it belongs to a large category of natural products chemically derived from 5-carbon \\"building blocks\\" (3) derived from isoprene (4). The complete structure consists of two identical monomers (2) that are attached via a suspected naturally occurring Diels Alder reaction occurring at the alkenes on the 5-membered ring of the guaianolide. :Illustration of the isoprenoid components involved in the biosynthesis of Absinthin Total synthesis Total synthesis of (+)-Absinthin was conducted in 2004 by Zhang, et al. The final yield reported for the synthesis was 18.6% over a course of 10 steps originating from Santonin (1), a commercially available reagent. The basis of the synthesis was the ring expansion of the original 6-membered carbon ring to the 7-membered ring, engendering the formation of the guaianolide monomer (2) scaffold, followed by Diels Alder coupling (3) and final stereochemical modifications resulting in (+)-Absinthin (4). Illustration of the total synthesis conducted by Zhang, et al. of Absinthin Biosynthesis The full biosynthesis of Absinthin in Artemisia absinthium has not been elucidated, but a great portion of it can be inferred from the natural product precursors required to access Absinthin. While terpenoids like Absinthin can be said to consist of isoprene \\"units,\\" isoprene by itself is unstable and does not react directly. Rather, the isoprene units are transferred and reacted as diphosphates. As the nomenclature for terpenes suggests, the first Absinthin precursor farnesyl diphosphate [A] contains 15 carbons, or 3 isoprene units. Diphosphate departure (1) generates a carbo- cation within the synthase, which can then be attacked by a carbon-carbon double bond at the opposing end of the molecule (2). The first stable intermediate in the biosynthesis pathway in Artemisia is likely Germacrene A [B], which has been previously identified in plant sesquiterpene pathways as a precursor to guaianolides. From there, hydroxylation (3) occurs, followed by oxidation (4) to an aldehyde directly followed by further hydroxylation (5) and formation of a carboxyl group. It is important to note the disappearance of the terminal carbon-carbon double bond after (4), as the reduction of this bond in the final product differentiates the Absinthin monomer from other Germacrene A downstream products. This reduction does not necessarily occur at step (4), but may occur further downstream. With the carboxyl and hydroxyl group in position, the guaiano-lactone [C] formation via dehydration (7) can occur, as proposed for a general guaianolide pathway. Formation of the Absinthin sesquiterpene guaianolide monomer [D] from hydroxylation and double bond rearrangement (8,9) is then postulated to directly precede dimerization to Absinthin [E] via a naturally occurring Diels-Alder reaction [10], which is likely facilitated by the associated synthase even though the reaction itself can occur in good yields spontaneously, albeit slower than typical natural product biosynthesis. Illustration of the proposed biosynthesis of Absinthin as interpreted from similar Guaianolide pathways in Artemisia While no synthases specific to Artemisia absinthium have been sufficiently isolated to recreate this particular sesquiterpene formation in vitro, the general reaction scheme presented here portrays a likely scenario for Absinthin biosynthesis through the use of terpene intermediates utilized in the biosynthesis of Germacrene A, another sesquiterpene lactone. Enzymatic analogs from terpene biosynthesis which help rationalize the above proposed numbered biosynthetic steps are as follows: # Farnesyl diphosphate departure via a generic sesquiterpene synthase # Ring closure via a generic sesquiterpene synthase (as for #1) # Hydroxlation of terminal allylic carbon via Germacrene A hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme. # Oxidation of alcohol to aldol, via -germacrene A hydroxylase. # Hydroxylation of alcohol to carboxyl group, via Germacrene A hydroxylase. # NADPH-mediated hydroxlation of allylic carbon via a postulated hydroxylation to precede lactone ring closure # Lactone formation/ring closure # Hydroxylation at carbon-carbon tertiary double bond. # Additional 5-membered ring formation/cyclization # Diels-Alder coupling via an unidentified enzyme in Artemisia absinthium.

Calder previously served as president of the French New Zealand Business Council and has served on the international governing body for pétanque. He takes credit for being one of the people who \\"imported\\" pétanque into New Zealand. He has two children. Member of Parliament Calder was number 58 on the National Party list in the 2008 election. The provisional results of the election would have made him an MP, but the number of seats allocated to the National Party dropped by one in the final count, preventing Calder from entering Parliament. Calder also contested the Manurewa electorate in the 2008 and 2011 elections, but lost to Labour MPs George Hawkins and to Louisa Wall respectively. After the resignation of Richard Worth on 12 June 2009, Calder entered Parliament in his place on 17 June 2009. In caucus, Calder served on the Law and Order and Local Government and Environment Select Committees. As a member of the Blue-Greens Caucus Committee, he believed that the opportunities for New Zealand in Clean-Green Technology are significant and was interested in strategies to promote the decentralised generation of power from renewable sources; Calder authored a discussion paper on the subject. His background, as a medical practitioner, has convinced him of the importance of personal responsibility in the maintenance of a healthy population. He is an enthusiastic advocate of a campaign to raise awareness of prostate cancer among New Zealand males. A long-term interest in education led him to canvass caucus support for an addition to Te Whariki, The Early Childhood Education Curriculum, of a requirement to introduce children, four years and older, to the alphabet and basic numeracy.

First described in 1829, the species has a widespread distribution, and is found in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. It is distinguished from other earthstars by the delicate fibers that line the circular pore at the top of its spore sac. Taxonomy Elias Magnus Fries described Geastrum fimbriatum (as Geaster fimbriatus) in his 1829 Systema mycologicum. It is commonly known as the fringed earthstar or the sessile earthstar. The specific epithet fimbriatum means \\"fringed\\", referring to the characteristic edge of the apical spore of the spore sac. Description The fruit bodies of Geastrum fimbriatum start out roughly spherical and hypogeous. As it matures, it pushed up through the soil and the other layer of the spore case (exoperidium) splits open to form between 5 and 8 rays that curve downward. The fully expanded fruit body has a diameter of up to . Before expansion, the outer surface has a cottony surface with adherent soil particles; this ultimately peels off to reveal a smooth, grayish-brown surface. The inner spore sac is yellowish brown and features a small conical pore with fringed edges. Unlike other similar earthstar fungi, the edges of this pore are not sharply delimited from the rest of the spore sac, and do not have grooves. The fruit bodies have no distinctive taste or odor. The spores are spherical, roughened by many small points or warts, and measure 2.4–4 μm. The capillitium is thick-walled, unbranched, and 4–7 μm thick. Similar species include Geastrum saccatum, which is larger – up to across – and has a clearly delimited ring-like area around the pore opening. Geastrum rufescens has reddish tones that are absent from G. fimbriatum. Although typically listed by field guides as an inedible species, it is eaten by the tribal peoples of Madhya Pradesh. Habitat and distribution Geastrum fimbriatum is a saprobic species, and it fruit bodies grow on the ground in groups or clusters, usually near the stumps of hardwood trees. It is found in Asia (India l, Mongolia), eastern North America (including Mexico), Central America (Costa Rica), South America (Brazil), and Europe.

The book advances Florida's previous work on the locational choices of people and businesses. He adds a dimension of environmental psychology by assigning psychological profiles to urban regions according to the dominant personality traits of the people who live there. For example, the New York metropolitan area and the ChiPitts area have the highest concentration in the United States of people whose dominant personality trait is neuroticism. Maps from study reprinted at Creativeclass.com The book ends with a ten step guide to choosing a location best suited to the reader's personality and life situation. Since the 2002 publication of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success in his study and promotion of the concept of a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world. Background alt=The book's author Richard Florida in 2006. Economic geographer Richard Florida came to prominence when he popularized the concept of a creative class, or a subset of individuals whose work involves creativity and innovation. Florida's previous three books, The Rise of the Creative Class (2002), Cities and the Creative Class (2005), and The Flight of the Creative Class (2005), link the creative class with wealth generation and argue that the individuals in the creative class choose to locate in places with strong cultural and recreational activities, as well as an interesting nightlife. Cities that have offered those activities have attracted innovative people, and despite high land and labor costs, businesses have chosen to re-locate to those areas in order to access them. With the success of his creative class theories, Florida founded a consulting firm, called the Creative Class Group, to advise local governments and other organizations about how to attract creative and innovative people. Florida, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College in Pittsburgh until 2005, wrote his next book, Who's Your City?, after moving to George Mason University's School of Public Policy. By the time he agreed to move to the University of Toronto he was deemed an \\"academic pop star\\". Upon his arrival, he was personally greeted by the mayor of Toronto and the premier of Ontario. Articles in the National Post and Toronto Star heralded his move, an article appeared in the magazine Style at Home featuring his new house, and he was given a regular column in The Globe and Mail. Synopsis =Part 1: Why Place Matters= Who's Your City? is divided into four parts with a total of 16 chapters. The first part presents data that suggests the world's population and economy are becoming increasingly geographically concentrated into few mega-regions, such as BosWash and the San Francisco Bay Area. Thomas Friedman's Flat World Theory, or his assertion that distance and place is becoming irrelevant, is countered by Florida with maps of population growth, economic activity, innovation (as demonstrated by patent registration), and scientific discovery (as demonstrated by residence of the most heavily cited scientists). Florida's maps show \\"spiky\\" concentrations in these mega-regions, although each region does not necessarily rank high in each category. For example, the Taiheiyō Belt ranks high in innovation but low in scientific discovery, and Indian and Pakistani cities show high population concentrations but low economic activity. Florida explains the existence of these geographical spikes by insisting that talented individuals tend to cluster to one another, creating a (non-linear) multiplier effect that attracts additional talented individuals to that geographical area. =Part 2: The Wealth of Place= The second part of the book presents evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate. =Part III: The Geography of Happiness= The third part of Who's Your City? examines the role of \\"where someone lives\\" as a factor of happiness. Florida's \\"Place and Happiness Survey\\", which he conducted with The Gallup Organization, shows that higher incomes and levels of education produces more community satisfaction, married people tend to be more satisfied with their community than singles, as older people as compared to younger people. In addition, renters are slightly more satisfied with their living arrangements than home owners, and people are generally satisfied with where they live.

Adding psychological profiles to his previous work, Florida was able to find strong connections between the Big Five personality traits and regions in the United States. For example, neuroticism is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area and the ChiPitts area, agreeableness and conscientiousness in the eastern Sunbelt area, extraversion in the Chicago metropolitan area, the St. Louis/Nashville/Atlanta area, and the South Florida area. Openness seems to be concentrated in the BosWash and the San Francisco Bay Area. Florida explains the results by linking the dominant forms of employment in the areas with the personality traits: manufacturing regions require people who are agreeable (i.e., they follow rules) and conscientious (they work with dangerous machinery), areas with high immigrant populations require that their residents exhibit openness, and management and sales-related jobs need workers with extroversion. Florida was also able to find that his \\"Gay and Bohemian Index\\", which connects gay and artistic communities to high growth and wealth generation areas, is a proxy for regions with large concentrations of the openness personality trait. =Part IV: Where We Live Now= The final part of the book suggests that most people have three significant moves: when leaving their parents' home, when starting a family, and when retiring (or when their own adult children move out). When young people leave their home (or when they complete college), they tend to locate to areas that offer attractive job markets, cultural or recreational amenities, and rank high in quality of life factors. When they get married or have children, people choose areas that are perceived as safe and family-friendly. Florida suggests using a \\"Trick-or- Treater Index\\" to gauge if parents feel safe allowing their children to go door-to-door on Halloween. He also cites Catherine Austin Fitts' \\"Popsicle Index\\", which gauges how far are parents willing to allow their children to walk to buy a treat. Once retired, or when their adult children move away, people tend to gravitate towards similar areas as young people, if it is close to their grandchildren, but in quieter neighborhoods that provide opportunities for hobbies or for a second career. Style Who's Your City? was intended to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text. The book has been described as having a \\"lighthearted tone...[that] doesn't always work\\", \\"earnest...[with] forced exuberance\\", and wandering from a broad \\"discussion of the world economy to home-buying advice\\". Doron Taussig of Washington Monthly described the book as a hybrid between \\"academic form\\" and \\"professional-advice-giving\\". Several reviewers noted that while a popular audience is the target, the book is also of interest to professionals or students of the topic. Publication Who's Your City? was published as a hardcover in March 2008 by Basic Books in the United States and Random House Canada in Canada. A year later, the trade paperback version was published in the United States. After Canadian reviewers commented on the US-focus of the book, a revised Canadian version, with some studies and maps expanded to include Canada, was published by Vintage Canada as a trade paperback. An international version was published overseas. Excerpts were published in The Globe and Mail newspaper and Fast Company magazine. Reception While critics recognize the value in Florida's work, many found the premise behind Who's Your City? flawed. The reviewer for Salon.com wrote it was questionable that \\"anyone, least of all a member of the creative class, would need such a self-help book. ... Ambitious people already have a clear sense of where they need to be, and wannabes know but can't get off their rusty dusties and go\\". Several critics noted that Florida sounded too eager to coin terms and that some of the pop cultural references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on the topic of the connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text. The reviewer in The Chronicle of Higher Education found the chapter that examined the Big Five personality traits to be the best part of the book. In The Globe and Mail, reviewer Joe Berridge wrote, \\"Like all self-help books, it suffers from the assertive blandness of soft psychologizing\\", but called Who's Your City? an \\"informative, insightful, imaginative book\\". Reviewer Nathan Glazer in The New Republic commented on the inappropriate urban area conglomerations like Delhi–Lahore, and geographical scales such as metropolitan areas. Steve Sailer of The American Conservative wrote a negative review and called Florida's conclusions \\"professionally cautious\\" so that they would not harm his consulting career. The review in the Library Journal recommended the book for all libraries and stated that \\"Although the text is occasionally overloaded with trendy demographic jargon, this thought-provoking and seminal work will surely be studied, not only by scholars but...by consumers pondering a move\\".

Iridoids are commonly found in plants and function as defensive compounds. Iridoids decrease the growth rates of many generalist herbivores.  Natural occurrences  Aucubin, as other iridoids, is found in asterids such as Aucuba japonica (Garryaceae), Eucommia ulmoides (Eucommiaceae), Plantago asiatica, Plantago major, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), Galium aparine (Rubiaceae) and others. These plants are used in traditional Chinese and folk medicine. Agnuside is composed of aucubin and p-hydroxybenzoic acid.  Health effects  Aucubin was found to protect against liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride or alpha-amanitin in mice and rats when 80 mg/kg was dosed intraperitoneally.  Chemistry  Aucubin is a monoterpenoid based compound. Aucubin, like all iridoids, has a cyclopentan-[C]-pyran skeleton. Iridoids can consist of ten, nine, or rarely eight carbons in which C11 is more frequently missing than C10. Aucubin has 10 carbons with the C11 carbon missing. The stereochemical configurations at C5 and C9 lead to cis fused rings, which are common to all iridoids containing carbocylclic- or seco-skeleton in non-rearranged form. Oxidative cleavage at C7-C8 bond affords secoiridoids. The last steps in the biosynthesis of iridoids usually consist of O-glycosylation and O-alkylation. Aucubin, a glycoside iridoid, has an O-linked glucose moiety. :left  Biosynthesis  Geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) is the precursor for iridoids. Geranyl phosphate is generated through the mevalonate pathway or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. The initial steps of the pathway involve the fusion of three molecules of acetyl-CoA to produce the C6 compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- CoA (HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA is then reduced in two steps by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. The resulting mevalonate is then sequentially phosphorylated by two separate kinases, mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase, to form 5-pyrophosphomevalonate. Phosphosphomevalonate decarboxylase through a concerted decarboxylation reaction affords isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). IPP is the basic C5 building block that is added to prenyl phosphate cosubstrates to form longer chains. IPP is isomerized to the allylic ester dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by IPP isomerase. Through a multi-step process, including the dephosphorylation DMAPP, IPP and DMAPP are combined to form the C10 compound geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). Geranyl pyrophosphate is a major branch point for terpenoid synthesis. Current biosynthesis studies suggest that the most probable synthetic sequence from 10-hydroxygerinol to 8-epi-iriotrial is the following: dephosphorylation of GPP, leads to a geranyl cation that is then hydroxylated to form 10-hydroxygeraniol; 10-hydroxylgeraniol is isomerized to 10-hydroxynerol; 10-hydroxynerol is oxidized using NAD to form a trialdehyde; finally the trialdehyde undergoes a double Michael addition to yield 8-epi-iridotrial. 8-Epi-iridotrial is another branch point intermediate. The cyclizaton reaction to form the iridoid pyran ring may result from one of two routes: # route 1 – a hydride nucleophillic attack on C1 will lead to 1-O-carbonyl atom attack on C3, yielding the lactone ring; # route 2 – loss of proton from carbon 4 leads to the formation of a double bond C3-C4; consequently the 3-O-carbonyl atom will attach to C1. Based on deuterium tracking studies, the biosynthetic pathway for aubucin from the cyclized lactone intermediate is organism specific. In Gardenia jasminoides, the cyclized lactone intermediate is glycosylated to form boschnaloside that is then hydroxylated on C10; boschnaloside is oxidized to geniposidic acid; geniposidic acid is then decarboxylated to form bartisioside; bartisioside is then hydroxylated to form aucubin. The Scrophularia umbrosa biosynthetic pathway is different from Gardenia jasminoides. In Scrophularia umbrosa, the lactone intermediate is glycosylated and oxidized at the C11 carbonyl to form 8-epi-dexoy-loganic acid, which is then converted to deoxygeniposidic acid; deoxygeniposidic acid is hydroxylated at C10 to geniposidic acid; decarboxylation and hydroxylation of C6 leads to aubucin. :left  References  Category:Iridoid glycosides Category:Glucosides Category:Cyclopentenes ","title":"Aucubin"},{"id":"23189761","text":"Geastrum pectinatum is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the earthstar family of fungi. Although young specimens are spherical, fruit body development involves the outer layer of tissue splitting open like a star into 7 to 10 pointed rays that eventually bend back to point downward, revealing a small – broad – spore sac. The spore sac is supported by a small radially wrinkled stalk. There is a distinct conical opening (peristome) at the top of the spore sac that is up to long. It is commonly known as the beaked earthstar or the beret earthstar, in reference to the shape of the spore sac and its prominent, protruding peristome. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the gleba, is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Spores are spherical, measuring 4 to 6 micrometers in diameter, with warts on their surfaces. Although uncommon, Geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been collected in various locations in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and Africa, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Like several other earthstars, crystals of calcium oxalate are found on G. pectinatum, and are thought to be involved in fruit body maturation. Taxonomy, classification, and naming Christian Hendrik Persoon published the first description of Geastrum pectinatum in 1801. In 1860, Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Geastrum biplicatum (originally named Geaster biplicatus), based on specimens sent to them by Charles Wright that he obtained from the Bonin Islands during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition. Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai considered this identical with G. pectinatum in a 1936 publication. In 1959, mycologist J.T. Palmer reported comparing the original specimen collected by Persoon with fresh samples of what were then thought to be the distinct species G. plicatum and G. tenuipes (named by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1838 and 1848, respectively) and concluded the three specimens were synonymous; the original Persoon specimen was then designated as the neotype. In Ponce de Leon's classification of Geastrum, he placed the species in the subgenus Geastrum, section Geastrum, as the type of the subsection Sulcostomata, group Pectinatum. Other species in this group—characterized by a determinate peristome surrounded by a groove—are G. xerophilum, and G. furfuraceum. In Stanek's (1958) infrageneric concept, G. pectinatum is placed in section Perimyceliata (encompassing species whereby the mycelial layer covers the entire endoperidium), in subsection Glabrostomata, which includes species with plicate peristomes. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin pectinatum, \\"like a comb\\". Its common names include the \\"beaked earthstar\\" or the \\"beret earthstar\\". Samuel Frederick Gray called it the \\"comblike shell-puff\\" in his 1821 \\"A Natural Arrangement of British Plants\\". Description Immature specimens – diameter – are roughly spherical and begin their development submerged in the ground, but gradually push above ground during maturation. In this state the outer surface is covered with mycelia, which forms a soft, fluffy coat that holds soil and debris to the outer surface. The young fruit bodies often have a rounded knob or protuberance. Like other members of genus Geastrum, G. pectinatum has a fruit body wall that is multilayered. At maturity, the outer layer (the exoperidium) splits open from the top in a stellate (star-shaped) manner into 7–9 rays that support the spore sac contained within the inner wall (the endoperidium). The expanded specimens are up to broad and tall. The rays of the exoperidium bend back (reflex), simultaneously elevating the spore sac above the ground in what is known as the fornicate condition; this position exposes the spore sac to more air currents, aiding spore dispersal. The surface of the rays often crack to reveal lighter-colored areas, especially along the edges. Together with a well-developed layer of mycelium, the rays are typically bound to fragments of earth or forest duff. Close-up of pedicel and underside of spore sac The tough and membranous endoperidium comprising the spore sac, purple-brown in color and tall by wide, is supported by a small stalk—a pedicel—that is 3–4 mm long by 7–10 mm wide and which has a grooved (sulcate) apophysis, or swelling. This ring-shaped swelling is made of remnants from a tissue called the pseudoparenchymatous layer. When fresh, the pseudoparenchymatous layer is whitish in color, thick and fleshy; it dries to become brown to dark brown while shrinking and often splitting and peeling. The endoperidium may be pruinose—covered with fine, white, powder—although the presence of this characteristic has been noted as being somewhat variable. The spore sac is opened by a single apical pore atop a conical \\"beak\\", or peristome. The peristome is pectinate—made of tissue that resembles the teeth of a comb; the specific epithet is named after this characteristic. The peristome is long, and comprises 20–32 distinct ridges. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the gleba, is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Internally, the endoperidium contains a structure called the columella that is narrowly conical in shape, whitish or pale brown, and extends more than halfway into the gleba. G. pectinatum has no distinguishable odor or taste; like other earthstar mushrooms, it is inedible, and of \\"no alimentary interest\\". =Microscopic characteristics= The spores of G. pectinatum are brown and opaque. They have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with transparent (hyaline), truncate warts; the diameter is 4–4.5 µm, or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included. Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized sterile cells that occur at the hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7 µm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted. =Similar species= Herbarium specimen Geastrum pectinatum has been mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G. schmidelii. The latter species lacks vertical striations on the basal portions of the endoperidium, and does not have a pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G. berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges at the base of the spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G. pectinatum. G. xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G. pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G. pectinatum, the spores of G. xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G. striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G. pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.Sunhede (1898), p. 426. Distribution and habitat This species has been reported to grow solitary or in groups on sandy soil or rich composted soil in both mixed and coniferous forests, often beneath cedars. In Hawaii, it is usually found growing in duff under coastal Casuarina and groves of Cupressus. The species has been noted to occur in late summer and autumn (in Britain and Europe), but the fruit bodies may dry and persist for some time. Geastrum pectinatum has a cosmopolitan distribution. It has been reported from Australia, and New Zealand, Africa (the Congo, South Africa) Central America (Costa Rica), Asia (Northeastern China and Japan), and South America (Brazil). In Europe, it has been reported from Belgium, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. In the Middle East, it has been recorded in Israel, and Turkey. In North America, it is known from the United States (including Hawaii), Canada, and Mexico. It is in the Red Data Book (documenting rare and endangered species) of Latvia, and is considered a threatened species in Poland. North American sources gives its frequency of appearance as \\"rare\\", but Stellan Sunhede, in his 1989 monograph on the Geastraceae, considers it one of the most common earthstar mushrooms of northern Europe.Sunhede (1898), p. 294. Calcium oxalate crystals Calcium oxalate is a common crystalline compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder on the surface of the spore sac—has been verified for G. pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.

He was later assisted in his practice by his brother William Keck to form the firm of Keck & Keck. Biography Keck was born in Watertown, Wisconsin, the eldest of five boys. He studied engineering for a year at the University of Wisconsin and then studied architecture engineering at the University of Illinois. Starting in the 1920s, he worked as a draftsman for several Chicago firms, including D. H. Burnham & Company and Schmidt, Garden and Martin. He started his own practice in 1926, and was joined by his younger brother William five years later.Stuart Cohen and Susan Bejamin; North Shore Chicago; Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs 1890-1940 Acanthus Press, 2004 George took an interest in the Deutscher Werkbund and the emerging International Style. Career The thumb Keck designed two key model structures for the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago in 1933; dubbed the \\"House of Tomorrow\\".Roth, Leland M. American Architecture: A History, (Google Books), Westview Press, 2003, p. 361, (). These two structures played in key role in the development of Keck's form of modernism. In 1934 he designed another model house, \\"Crystal House\\", which was directly reminiscent of the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer.Prince, Sue Ann. The Old Guard and the Avant Garde: Modernism in Chicago 1910-1940, (Google Books), University of Chicago Press, 1990 p. 132, (). Keck became a pioneering designer of passive solar houses in the 1930s and 40s after realizing that the all-glass \\"House of Tomorrow\\" was warm inside on sunny winter days prior to the installation of the furnace. Following this he gradually started incorporating more south-facing windows into his designs for other clients, and in 1940 designed a passive solar home for real estate developer Howard Sloan in Glenview, Illinois. The Sloan House was called a \\"solar house\\" by the Chicago Tribune, the first modern use of that term. Sloan then built a number of passive solar houses, and his publicity efforts contributed to a significant \\"solar house\\" movement in the 1940s. Keck taught architecture at the New Bauhaus School (now IIT Institute of Design). He was the head of architecture there until 1942 and appointed Ralph Rapson as his successor. Rapson also worked in Keck's office during this period, as did fellow New Bauhaus School professor Robert Bruce Tague.

The tunnel itself is located near 8th Street and Ridge Road. Northbound passenger trains going through the tunnel traveled to Union Station in Bethlehem and points beyond. Many southbound passenger trains were destined for Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. The Perkasie station on 8th Street was formerly equipped with a water tower, of which not a trace remains. Physical features The tunnel is curved and the entrances are constructed in such a way that light entering the tunnel at the 8th Street entrance is visible from the opposite end of the tunnel near Ridge Road; this is apparently not the case in the opposite direction. The edges of the tunnel are jagged, allowing beautiful ice structures to form when water dripping from the top and sides freezes in winter. The tunnel is lined with stone masonry at both entrances. The walls in the interior of the tunnel are unfinished, blasted stone. The tunnel bore remains cool enough in summer that track workers or trespassers require a light jacket or sweatshirt. Signage on the Perkasie Tunnel consists of graffiti and the occasional \\"No Trespassing\\" sign. Whispers inside the tunnel are said to carry to each end slowly and eerily. Cell phone service is unavailable inside the tunnel. Trains The last scheduled passenger train traveled though Perkasie on July 29, 1981, after which passenger service terminated as part of a broader SEPTA strategy of discontinuing all non-electrified passenger service. Conrail continued freight operations to Quakertown until Conrail's demise in the mid-1990s, at which point CSX took over operations and leased the line between Lansdale and Telford. The trains passing through the Perkasie tunnel currently stop in the town of Perkasie only when necessary to switch freight cars to the (otherwise unused) Southbound track for storage. SEPTA discussed abandoning the tracks between Telford and Quakertown when financial incentives for continued CSX freight service declined below the break-even point for a Class-1 railroad. This portion of the Bethlehem Branch was saved from abandonment when short line railroad company East Penn Railway (EPRY) leased the portion between Telford and Quakertown in 1997 to continue operations under the name East Penn Railroad (ESPN). Depending on the workload, East Penn Railroad, operating out of Quakertown, runs trains on the Bethlehem Branch two to three times a week as well as the occasional weekend. SEPTA remains owner of the Bethlehem Branch from Lansdale to Hellertown. Norfolk Southern owns the section from Hellertown through Bethlehem. Operational track presently ends at California Road just above Quakertown because the East Penn Railroad had no use for it. See North Pennsylvania Railroad for more Bethlehem Branch information. SEPTA has also proposed the re-activation of train service to Quakertown, but SEPTA has not planned such a task.

History State Route 225 was first designated in 1924, though initially it ran along part of what is now Alliance Road in Portage County, extending from the current U.S. Route 224 to the south and ending at State Route 14 in the small town of Yale to the north. In 1931, State Route 225 was routed along what is now the northern section of State Route 183 from Atwater Center north to Edinburg. By 1937, it was again rerouted and extended, returning to its original location to Yale, but this time going further north to State Route 18, and extending south to Alliance along its current alignment south of U.S. Route 224. As part of the construction of the new Interstate 80S, part of SR 18 was rerouted onto the new freeway by 1966, leaving the northern terminus of SR 225 at the former SR 18 (Tallmadge Road). By 1969, the northern terminus of SR 225 was moved back to SR 14 in Yale as the section of SR 225 between Yale and SR 18 was decommissioned. In 1970, State Route 225 was rerouted once again to its current alignment, turning east along U.S. Route 224 to Deerfield Center and then turning north at State Route 14 along what had previously been designated State Route 627.

It has smooth white bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven or more, white flowers and cup-shaped, urn-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit. It has a restricted distribution on poor, rocky soils near Sydney.flower budsflowersfruit Description Eucalyptus luehmanniana is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a Lignotuber. It has smooth white to brown bark that is shed in long ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and sessile, glossy green, elliptic to broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and eleven or more on a flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped to diamond shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum about the same size as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between June and December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, urn- shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves close to rim level. This mallee has sometimes been confused with the tree species E. haemastoma and E. stricta. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus luehmanniana was first formally described in 1878 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The type specimen was collected in sandy rocky ground by William Kirton, \\"eight miles north of Bulli at an elevation of 2000 feet\\".The specific epithet honours Johann George Luehmann, who was Mueller's assistant in the Melbourne Herbarium. Distribution and habitat The yellow top mallee ash grows in mallee heath on shallow soils derived from sandstone on the coastal plateau in the Sydney region, between the Hawkesbury River and Bulli. Despite having a restricted distribution, it is locally abundant. Culture The fruit of this eucalypt was depicted on the original five dollar note, beside a drawing of Joseph Banks.

Seward and his wife Frances Adeline Miller. The last of five children born to the Sewards, she was their only daughter to survive to adulthood. Early life Frances Seward was born in Auburn, New York on December 9, 1844.Walter Stahr, Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man, 2013, page 89 Her father was a prominent Whig who had served as Governor of New York, and would later become a United States Senator, join the Republican Party, and serve as Secretary of State under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.U.S. Senate Historian, Biography, William H.

Taylor, William Henry Seward: Lincoln's Right Hand, 1996 Fanny received a progressive education and upbringing, and aspired to be a writer. Her mother was frequently ill and ill-disposed to travel and socializing, and chose to remain at home in Auburn while her husband served in the Senate and the cabinet. When her father began his term as Secretary of State in 1861, Fanny, then sixteen, resided with him in Washington, D.C. and became his closest domestic companion.University of Rochester Library Bulletin, \\"I Could Not be Well or Happy at Home... When Called to the Councils of My Country\\": Politics and the Seward Family, Volume XXXI Number 1, Autumn 1978 Recognized as sensitive and precocious, she demonstrated her desire for a literary career by authoring both fiction and poetry. She is best known for keeping a voluminous diary throughout the course of the Civil War, which documented with intimate detail the social and political milieu of Washington during the Lincoln administration.Kevin Peraino, Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power, 2013 Attempted assassination of William H. Seward Lewis Powell attacking Frederick Seward after attempting to shoot him. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lewis Powell, an associate and co- conspirator of John Wilkes Booth, attempted to assassinate Seward at his Washington D.C. home. Powell's attack on Seward was coordinated with Booth's attack on President Abraham Lincoln and George Atzerodt's aborted attack on Vice President Andrew Johnson in order to maximize the element of surprise and to sever the continuity of the United States government. Another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack as well as guiding him out of the city during their escape. Powell was able to gain access to the Seward home by telling William Bell, an African American employed by the Sewards, that he was delivering medicine for Seward, who had been badly injured nine days earlier in a carriage accident. Upon entry to the home, Powell began up the stairs, but was stopped at the top of the stairs by Frederick Seward, the Secretary's son. Frederick told Powell that his father was asleep and that he (Frederick) would take the medicine to him. Fanny Seward was in her father's bedroom. Hearing the noise on the stairs, she opened the door and looked outside. Powell asked her if the Secretary was asleep, and she acknowledged that he was. Now certain of Seward's location, Powell pretended to leave and started down the stairs, but suddenly turned around, drew a pistol, and pointed it at Frederick's head. The pistol misfired.Edward Steers, Jr., Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, 2001. Realizing he needed to act quickly, Powell began beating Frederick over the head with the barrel of his gun. The force of Powell's blows crippled Frederick Seward and left him sprawled on the floor, in a pool of blood. Powell's gun was also rendered useless during the melee, as it had become jammed.Blue & Gray Enterprises, Blue & Gray Magazine, Volumes 7–8, 1989, p. 51. Fanny was in Seward's bedroom with him. Hearing the loud noises coming from the second floor hallway, she opened the door to see her brother slumped on the floor and a wide-eyed Powell charging directly towards her, a dagger in his hand. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward to the side, and jumped on the Secretary's bed, repeatedly stabbing him in the face and neck area. Powell also attacked and injured another son (Augustus Seward), and a soldier and nurse (Sergeant George Robinson) who had been assigned to stay with Seward.Brian Lamb, Susan Swain, C-SPAN, Abraham Lincoln: Great American Historians on Our Sixteenth President, 2010, pp. 175–176. Outside the home, David Herold, who could hear the screams coming from the house, fled with both horses, leaving Powell to fend for himself. Powell, convinced that he had mortally wounded the Secretary, fled down the stairs, and stabbed a messenger, Emerick Hansell, who had arrived just as Powell was escaping; Hansell never fully recovered from the stabbing.Dave Taylor, Surratt Courier, Emerick Hansell: The Forgotten Casualty, November 2010. Fanny Seward and George Robinson worked to save Secretary Seward's life and tend to the others who were injured, attempting to stanch their bleeding and tending to their wounds until doctors could arrive. All five men that were injured that night survived, although Secretary Seward would carry facial scars from the attack for the rest of his life.Frederick Hatch, Protecting President Lincoln, 2011, pp. 97–98. Powell was captured several days later at the boarding house of Mary Surratt. He was executed on July 7, 1865, along with David Herold, George Atzerodt, and Mrs. Surratt, three of the seven convicted as conspirators in the Lincoln assassination.David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T.

Vocalist Anne Lise Frøkedal wrote two of the songs for the album, the rest were provided by Øvstedal. \\"We were young ... maybe we were naïve\\", drummer Bjarne Stensli later said of the album; \\"the band was unfinished, it sounded strange\\". In a 2004 interview, Frøkedal mentioned a distinct difference in songwriting style between herself and Øvstedal. These differences eventually led to Øvstedal's departure. Bassist Ole Myhrvold later referred to it as \\"a musical divorce\\". The remaining four members decided to stay together and reformed under a new name, \\"Harrys gym\\". Whereas the name \\"Dharma\\" had been inspired by the novel The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac, the new band was named after an abandoned fitness center in the same building as their rehearsal space. The band deliberately omitted the possessive apostrophe from the name, to adhere to Norwegian grammatical rules. According to Frøkedal, Harrys gym is a \\"more pure pop band\\" than Dharma, with a \\"cleaner and more stringent sound\\". = Debut album = Performing at the Slottsfjell festival, 2009 Harrys gym released their eponymous debut album, on 27 October 2008. The album was produced by Stensli, with all songs written by Frøkedal. Dagbladet rated it 5 out of 6. According to the reviewer, \\"Anne Lise Frøkedal's vocals doesn't sound like leaves on the ground, but rather snow in the air, swirling and massive, weightless and fragile ...\\" Verdens Gang rated it 4 out of 6, characterizing the music as \\"fascinating dream-indie\\". One of the songs from the album, \\"Whisper\\", is played twice in the Norwegian horror film Cold Prey 2. \\"To sit in Colosseum Kino and hear our own song in that setting was insane\\", Stensli later said. Another song, \\"Brother\\", was put in rotation by NRK P3 in November 2008. The song caught the attention of Universal Music Norway, and after several meetings, the band was eventually signed. = What Was Ours Can't Be Yours = Harrys gym released their second album 'What Was Ours Can't Be Yours' in the UK and mainland Europe in February 2011 on Oslo-based label Splendour. The band worked on the album with UK producer James Rutledge. = Festivals = Harrys gym has performed twice at the by:Larm festival. NME placed them in their top 5 list of artists of by:Larm 2008. Their performance also received a positive notice from Drowned in Sound's reviewer, who was particularly impressed by Frøkedal's vocals and guitar. He lauded the band for an \\"entirely engaging set, equal parts delicate and muscular\\". Their 2009 performance was well received by Clash, who highlighted the \\"stupidly talented drummer\\", and Frøkedal's \\"acerbic vocals\\" for particular acclaim. He compared the latter to the vocals of Garbage and The Knife. = Breakup = The band announced their breakup on 11 January 2013 on their Facebook page.

These natural products are cyclic hexa- or hepta depsipeptides produced by various members of the genus of bacteria Streptomyces. Many of the members of the streptogramins reported in the literature have the same structure and different names; for example, pristinamycin IA = vernamycin Bα = mikamycin B = osteogrycin B. Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of streptogramin B is carried out by large multifunctional enzymes called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). In the NRPS system, each amino acid is activated as an aminoacyladenylate and is linked to the enzyme as a thioester with a phosphopantetheinyl group. An elongation reaction then occurs by transferring the activated carboxyl to the amino group in the next amino acid, thus executing the N-to-C stepwise condensation. NRPSs contain several modules on a single polypeptide. Each of these modules can catalyze activation, condensation and a modification reaction specific to one kind of amino acid. A typical elongation module consists of an adenylation domain (A), a peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP) and a condensation domain (C). Some other domains may be present that are responsible for modifications to the residues, such as epimerization domain (E) and N-methyltransferase domain (MT). The domain responsible for the termination is the thioesterase domain (TE) located in the final module. =Amino acid composition= The general amino acid composition of streptogramin B consists of: 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, L-threonine, D-aminobutyric acid, L-proline, 4-N,N-(dimethylamino)-L-phenylalanine, 4-oxo- L-pipecolic acid and phenylglycine. File:Streptogramin B (aa composition).png =Modular Arrangement= File:Streptogramin B (modules).png File:Cyclization Streptogramin B.png Mechanism of Action Streptogramins A and B synergically inhibit cell growth of gram positive, less so gram negative bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis, but separately they are bacteriostatic. The molecular target of streptogramins is the 23S rRNA. Both streptogramin A and B bind to the P binding site of the 50S ribosome subunit. The type A streptogramin binding causes a conformational change to the 50S subunit, which increases the activity of the type B streptogramin by a 100-fold. Streptogramin B prevents the elongation of protein chains and causes the release of incomplete peptides. Clinical use The streptogramin antibiotics were identified almost 50 years ago, but have only recently found clinical use as a consequence of the increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria. They present poor solubility in aqueous solution, and this has limited their clinical use; however, the natural products still find use as feed additives in agriculture. Medicinal chemists at Rhône-Poulenc worked in the preparation of semi-synthetic, water-soluble, derivatives of pristinamycin IA (B type streptogramin) and pristinamycin IIA (A type streptogramin) giving rise to quinupristin and dalfopristin, respectively, which, when administered in a 3:7 ratio, comprise the 1999 FDA approved drug Synercid.

Comets have, through the centuries, appeared in numerous works of fiction. In earliest times they were seen as portents, either of disaster or of some great historical change. As knowledge of comets increased, comets came to be imagined not just as symbols, but as powerful forces in their own right, capable of causing disaster. More recently, comets have been described as destinations for space travelers. Fictional comets =Their properties= As destructive forces *Voltaire, in his Lettre sur la prétendue comète (1773), comments ironically on the rumours of impending doom surrounding Lalande's presentation to the Académie des sciences of his \\"Réflexions sur les comètes qui peuvent approcher de la Terre\\". *Poe's The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion (1839) is an end-of-the-world story involving a comet that steals the nitrogen from Earth's atmosphere, the remaining oxygen causing our fiery end. * Camille Flammarion's La Fin du Monde (The End of the World, 1894) describes a 24th-century collision of a comet with Earth. * Tove Jansson's Comet in Moominland (1946) depicts the world of the Moomins threatened by a fiery comet. * Lucifer's Hammer (1977), a novel by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, is an apocalyptic survival story featuring a comet impact on Earth. * The Paramount/DreamWorks motion picture Deep Impact (1998) tells the story of a comet (fictional Wolf-Biederman) on a collision course with Earth, and focuses primarily on the emotional reactions of those who are affected by the impending disaster. Of the past *Jules Verne's Voyages et Aventures du Capitaine Hatteras (Journeys and Adventures of Captain Hatteras, 1866) briefly alludes to then-current hypothesis of an antediluvian cometary collision with Earth, responsible for shifting our planet's rotation axis. As supernatural signs * Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' Lettre sur la comète (1742) mentions: *:« Ces astres, après avoir été si longtemps la terreur du monde, sont tombés tout à coup dans un tel discrédit, qu'on ne les croit plus capables de causer que des rhumes. » *:Roughly translated: « These stars, after having been the terror of the world for such a long time, have suddenly fallen in such discredit that they are not thought to be able to cause anything but colds. » * In George R. R. Martin's A Clash of Kings, a comet with a red tail is seen in the sky and interpreted as both an ill omen or a fortuitous one by the various characters and factions in the book. * In E. R. Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, a comet appears before the final battle before the walls of Carcë: \\"The same night there appeared in the sky impending over Carcë a blazing star with two bushes.\\" Both sides in the conflict see it, \\"[a]nd King Gorice, sitting in his chamber with his baleful books, beheld that star and its fiery streamers, which the King rather noted than liked. For albeit he might not know of a certain what way that sign intended, yet was it apparent to one so deeply learned in nigromancy and secrets astronomical that this thing was fatal, being of those prodigies and ominous prognosticks which fore-run the tragical ends of noble persons and the ruins of states.\\" As vehicles * Thomas Charles Morgan's \\"Glimpses of Other Worlds\\" (1835) tells of a ride on a comet controlled by \\"a phial or two of concentrated essence of gravitation.\\" * Jules Verne's Hector Servadac, Voyages et aventures à travers le Monde Solaire (Off on a Comet, 1877) is a Victorian vision of touring the solar system via handy \\"comet Gallia\\". * In Mark Twain's story \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\" (1907), Stormfield rides a comet to heaven, but arrives at the wrong gate of heaven because he races with another comet on the way. * A comet very similar to Halley's Comet plays an important role in the first two novels of Glen Cook's dark fantasy series The Black Company, The Black Company (May 1984) and Shadows Linger (October 1984). * In his Revelation Space series, particularly in the novel Redemption Ark (2002), Alastair Reynolds depicts a future human civilization's most advanced society, the Conjoiners, living in the interior of a comet in the very distant Oort Cloud of another star. * Charles R.

The white patterning can be so prolific that it covers the majority of the snake. The highly distinctive black and white colour phase is common in central Thailand, specimens from western Thailand are mostly black, whereas individuals from elsewhere are usually brown. The hood mark can be spectacle-shaped, irregular or missing altogether, especially in adults. Adults average long, and can reach a maximum of though this is very rare. This species should not be confused with the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia), which has similar habitat, size and appearance. =Scalation= There are 25-31 scale rows around the hood, 19-21 just ahead of midbody; 153-174 ventral scales, 45-54 subcaudal scales, and basal pairs are sometimes undivided. Distribution and habitat It is found in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. May occur in eastern Myanmar but no records are known. It occupies a range of habitats including lowlands, hills, plains, and woodland. It can also be found in jungle habitat and it is sometimes attracted to human settlements because of the abundant populations of rodents in and around these areas. Image:Naja-siamensis-indochinese-spitting-cobra-southwest-thailand.jpgNaja siamensis from Phetchaburi province, Thailand Behavior and diet It is a primarily nocturnal species. It shows variable temperament depending on the time of day it is encountered. When threatened during daylight hours, the snake is generally timid and seeks refuge in the nearest burrow. However, when the snake is threatened at night, it is more aggressive and is more likely to stand its ground, rear up and display its hood and spit out its venom. If spitting venom doesn't work, it will strike and bite as a last resort. When biting, this species tends to hold on and chew savagely. It usually feeds on rodents, toads, and other snakes. Reproduction The snake is oviparous. The female will lay 13-19 eggs 100 days after oviposition. Eggs will hatch after 48 to 70 days depending on the temperature of incubation. Offspring are independent as soon as they have hatched. Hatchlings are 12–20 cm long and, because they possess fully developed venom delivery systems, should be treated with the same respect as adults. Venom Like most other spitting cobras, its venom is primarily a postsynaptic neurotoxin and cytotoxin (necrotizing or tissue-death). The of its venom is 1.07-1.42 mg/gram of mouse body weight.Chanhome, L., Cox, M. J., Vasaruchaponga, T., Chaiyabutra, N. Sitprija, V. (2011). Characterization of venomous snakes of Thailand. Asian Biomedicine 5 (3): 311–328. Bite symptoms include pain, swelling and necrosis around the wound. The bite of this snake is potentially lethal to an adult human. Deaths, which generally happen due to paralysis and consequent asphyxiation, mainly occur in rural areas where the procurement of antivenin is difficult. If the snake spits venom into the eyes of an individual, the individual will experience immediate and severe pain as well as temporary and sometimes even permanent blindness. Taxonomy This species was long confused with the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia) and the Chinese cobra (Naja atra), and extensive variation in pattern and scalation contributed to this confusion. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses revealed it to be a distinct species during the 1990s.

Performances mostly consist of one or two 25-minute Harold sets, though the group often experiments with various styles and forms. Among the improvisation, theater, and comedy festivals in which The Purple Crayon has appeared are the National College Comedy Festival at Skidmore College, on and off since its inception in 1990 by 30 Rock producer David Miner; the Bellwether Improv Festival at Ohio State University; Brown University's College Hill Longform Improv Festival; the Slate Comedy Festival at The George Washington University; the Out of the Loop Festival at the WaterTower Theatre in Texas; and the annual Del Close Marathon run by the UCB Theatre in New York City.

The concept of waṣf was also borrowed into Persian, which developed its own rich poetic tradition in this mode.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 32-33. Role in Arabic verse Waṣf was one of four kinds of poetry in which medieval Arabic poets were expected to be competent, alongside 'the boast (fakhr), the invective (hijaa’), and the elegy (marthiya)'.Cole, Peter, ed. and trans., The Dream of the Poem: Hebrew Poetry from Muslim and Christian Spain, 950–1492 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 530. Probably deriving from the descriptions of the abandoned campsite and beloved in the ancient qasida's erotic prelude, and of animals and landscape in the journey section, or rahiil, it evolved into a genre of its own in Abbasid Baghdad and later in Spain. The tradition in Arabic was highly developed, with poets often devoting entire collections to elaborate treatments of single subjects, such as hunting animals, kinds of flowers, and specific objects. [...] While one might initially be inclined to take the genre of wasf poetry lightly--since it involves \\"mere\\" description, in fact an argument could be made for seeing this genre as, in some instances, central to the poetry of the period. In waṣf love poems, each part of a lover's body is described and praised in turn, often using exotic, extravagant, or even far- fetched metaphors. The Song of Solomon is a prominent example of such a poem, and other examples can be found in Thousand and One Nights. The images given in this type of poetry are not literally descriptive. Instead, they convey the delight of the lover for the beloved, where the lover finds freshness and splendor in the body as a reflected image in the world. Other varieties of waṣf include literary riddles. Outside Arabic This genre had a long history and later became a favorite of the troubadour poets and the authors of sonnets in the Elizabethan era. This renaissance literature was popularized by French authors via Italian and was called the blasons anatomiques or blazon (see Italian poet Petrarch). Shakespeare effectively ended this movement with his Sonnet 130 which satirized the form. For instance, the first line in that satire reads, \\"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.\\"Mabillard, Amanda.

It was triggered by the forced resignation of Labor MLA Joshua Arthur, after a Royal Commission found his dealings with Reginald Doyle were improper. and was won by independent candidate Tom Armstrong. Background Joshua Arthur had been the Labor member for Kahibah and its predecessor seat of Hamilton since 1935. He had been a minister in the McGirr government, serving as Minister for Tourist Activities and Immigration from 1949 to 1950, before being promoted to Secretary for Mines and Minister for Immigration. On 9 February 1953, William Wentworth, a NSW member of federal parliament, aired allegations concerning Arthur's associations with Reginald Doyle, a Newcastle-based conman who was wanted on fraud charges. Arthur voluntarily stood down as a minister while declaring he would fight to clear his name, and the state government set up a Royal Commission into the allegations, to be held under Judge George Amsberg of the District Court. Amsberg's report, handed down in August after several months of hearings, found that Arthur had acted improperly but not corruptly in his dealings with Doyle. In the immediate wake of the Royal Commission's findings, Arthur announced on 20 August that he would resign as member for Kahibah, but would contest the resulting by-election. The matter of his continued membership of the Labor was initially undecided, but when it became clear that the state executive would not support him, Arthur announced that he would resign from the party and not contest the by-election. This was insufficient for the executive, who rejected his resignation and formally expelled him from the party on 22 August. Candidates Five candidates nominated for the by- election. The Labor candidate for the by-election was Joshua Arthur Sr., the 71-year-old father of the outgoing member. His nomination and eventual victory in the preselection ballot was widely considered a surprise. There was reported concern within the Labor Party about his electability in the wake of the Doyle scandal, but a rumored move to overturn the result did not eventuate. The campaign was heavily tied to the former member; not only was his father the Labor candidate, but his wife served as campaign manager. Tom Armstrong, a Newcastle councillor, former mayor, and prominent union official, contested the seat as an independent Labor candidate. Inglis Alexander, the Liberal candidate from the 1952 election, also contested the election as independent Labor after losing Liberal preselection. The endorsed Liberal candidate was Harry Quinlan, while the endorsed Communist candidate was Douglas Olive. Result Joshua Arthur () was forced to resign after a Royal Commission found his dealings with Reginald Doyle were improper. The by- election was a disastrous defeat for Labor in one of their safest seats. Arthur suffered a 40% swing against, finishing third behind independent candidate Armstrong and Liberal candidate Quinlan, with Armstrong being elected on Arthur's preferences. Aftermath Armstrong had never been a member of the Labor Party, but generally supported the Labor government throughout his term. He was re-elected at the 1956 election, but died suddenly in March 1957. The seat reverted to Labor control upon his death, being won by endorsed candidate Jack Stewart.

The theorem is named after Adolf Hurwitz. Statement Let {fk} be a sequence of holomorphic functions on a connected open set G that converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f which is not constantly zero on G. If f has a zero of order m at z0 then for every small enough ρ > 0 and for sufficiently large k ∈ N (depending on ρ), fk has precisely m zeroes in the disk defined by z − z0 < ρ, including multiplicity. Furthermore, these zeroes converge to z0 as k → ∞., Remarks The theorem does not guarantee that the result will hold for arbitrary disks. Indeed, if one chooses a disk such that f has zeroes on its boundary, the theorem fails. An explicit example is to consider the unit disk D and the sequence defined by :f_n(z) = z-1+\\\\frac 1 n, \\\\qquad z \\\\in \\\\mathbb C which converges uniformly to f(z) = z − 1\\\\. The function f(z) contains no zeroes in D; however, each fn has exactly one zero in the disk corresponding to the real value 1 − (1/n). Applications Hurwitz's theorem is used in the proof of the Riemann mapping theorem, and also has the following two corollaries as an immediate consequence: * Let G be a connected, open set and {fn} a sequence of holomorphic functions which converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f. If each fn is nonzero everywhere in G, then f is either identically zero or also is nowhere zero. * If {fn} is a sequence of univalent functions on a connected open set G that converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f, then either f is univalent or constant.  Proof  Let f be an analytic function on an open subset of the complex plane with a zero of order m at z0, and suppose that {fn} is a sequence of functions converging uniformly on compact subsets to f. Fix some ρ > 0 such that f(z) ≠ 0 in 0 < z − z0 ≤ ρ. Choose δ such that f(z) > δ for z on the circle z − z0 = ρ. Since fk(z) converges uniformly on the disc we have chosen, we can find N such that fk(z) ≥ δ/2 for every k ≥ N and every z on the circle, ensuring that the quotient fk′(z)/fk(z) is well defined for all z on the circle z − z0 = ρ. By Morera's theorem we have a uniform convergence: : \\\\frac{f_k'(z)}{f_k(z)} \\\\to \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}. Denoting the number of zeros of fk(z) in the disk by Nk, we may apply the argument principle to find : m = \\\\frac 1 {2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{\\\\vert z -z_0\\\\vert = \\\\rho} \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} \\\\,dz = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac 1 {2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{\\\\vert z -z_0\\\\vert = \\\\rho} \\\\frac{f'_k(z)}{f_k(z)} \\\\, dz = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} N_k In the above step, we were able to interchange the integral and the limit because of the uniform convergence of the integrand. We have shown that Nk → m as k → ∞. Since the Nk are integer valued, Nk must equal m for large enough k.,  See also *Rouché's theorem  References   John B. Conway.

Strategy At Essen, the European Council had asked the Member States to draw up multiannual programmes for employment (MAPs) and to provide the Commission with reports on their implementation. These reports describe the main measures taken by the governments to apply their multiannual programmes over the previous twelve months, assess, in certain cases, the impact of those measures on employment, and announce major changes or new initiatives in this field. The European Employment Strategy is built around priority themes under the four pillars of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Each year, the Member States draw up National Action Plans on Employment (NAPS) implementing these broad policy guidelines. The NAPS are analysed by the Commission and the Council, and the results, presented in a Joint Employment Report, serve as a basis for reprioritising and making recommendations to Member States in respect of their employment policies. Five years after its launch, the European strategy entered a review phase. In January 2003, the Commission adopted a communication presenting a new approach through the European Employment Strategy, better adapted to the needs of an ageing population, increasing women's participation in the labour market, enlargement and the increasing pace of economic change. Main priorities of the new strategy are full employment and better working conditions.

History In the seventh century, Minangkabau merchants sold gold in Jambi and were involved in the formation of the Malayu Kingdom. They became influential traders who operated on the west and east coasts of Sumatra. Initially, the primary trading commodity of Minangkabau society was gold. Besides gold, Minangkabau merchants also brought spice from the Sumatran hinterland to be sold in the Straits of Malacca. Many Minangkabau people worked as intermediary traders for the Srivijaya empire, the Sultanate of Aceh and the Sultanate of Malacca. Minangkabau merchants built trading posts along the west coast of Sumatra from Meulaboh to Bengkulu. During the latter part of the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century, Minangkabau businesspeople developed a flourishing trade in gambier, coffee, and textiles. This led to conflicts with both local rulers and the Dutch. The Minangkabau traders who sought free markets on the east coast of Sumatra were attempting to break the monopolies of the Dutch and the local political authority. The population of Minangkabau merchants declined after the Dutch defeated the Minangkabau people in the Padri War. Thereafter, West Sumatra and its trading system were under the control of the Dutch East Indies until Indonesia's independence in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, a number of Minangkabau businesspeople emerged as indigenous traders among the Chinese. The most prominent included Rahman Tamin, Anwar Sutan Saidi, Sidi Tando, Hasyim Ning, Djohan and Djohor, and Sutan Sjahsam. Tamin traded in small- holders rubber, tea, coffee, and pepper. Two brothers, Djohan and Djohor, worked with Dasaad on the import of textiles from Japan and the import of raw cotton for the Indonesian textile industry. Sidi Tando opened a paint factory and moved into shipping in the early 1960s. Sutan Sjahsam, the brother of PNI figure Sutan Sjahrir, owned an import company, N.V. Soetan Sjahsam Corporation, and was the founder of Indonesian Capital Market. Hasyim Ning, the Mohammad Hatta's step-brother, developed the automotive industry. In 1952, Ning was appointed President Director of The Indonesian Service Company, which imported and assembled Dodge trucks and Willey's jeeps. Types of business =Restaurant= Restaurants and food services are the Minangkabau merchants' favoured sector. Minangkabau restaurants, known as Restoran Padang, can be found in many Indonesian cities as well as in Malaysia and Singapore. The merchants always build their own brand for their restaurants, as was the case with Restoran Sederhana, the biggest Minangkabau restaurant chain, which has over 160 outlets across Indonesia. Besides Restoran Sederhana, other Minang restaurant chains that have expanded overseas are Sari Ratu, Garuda and Natrabu. =Textiles= In the traditional markets of Indonesia's major cities, many Minangkabau traders are involved as the textile traders. In Jakarta, Minangkabau traders dominate traditional trade centers, such as Tanah Abang, Senen, Blok M, Jatinegara, and Cipulir. The dominance of Minangkabau textile traders also occurred in Medan and Pekan Baru. Besides that, some of Minang textile business centers are Kuala Lumpur, Surabaya, Bandung, Batam, Yogyakarta, and Pekalongan. During the 1940-1950s, Rahman Tamin was one of the largest textile entrepreneurs in Indonesia. =Craftwork= There are many Minangkabau merchants who sell gold products, silverware or shoes. Most of them came from Pandai Sikek and Silungkang. Many of the Sungai Puar people sell antiques. They settled mainly in Cikini and Ciputat (both in Jakarta). =Printing= A significant number of Minangkabau merchants were also involved with publishing houses and printing. Some of notable figures in the printing business were Lukman Sa'ad, Amir Hamzah, Rozali Usman, Rainal Rais, Joesoef Isak and H.M Arbie. =Hospitality= The Indonesian tourism sector is another industry in which Minangkabau merchants operate, building and running hotels and tour travel companies. In Jakarta, Minangkabau businesspeople developed the Grand Menteng hotel chain. Basrizal Koto built the Best Western Hotel in Pekanbaru and Padang. Natrabu Tour, founded by Rahimi Sutan, is a major travel company. =Education= Universities in Jakarta owned by Minangkabaus are Jayabaya University, University of Persada Indonesia YAI, University of Borobudur and The London School of Public Relations. =Media= A number of media (newspaper, magazine and television network) companies were founded by Minangkabaus. They include Oetoesan Melajoe, founded by Sutan Maharaja in 1915; Panji Masyarakat magazine by Hamka; the newspaper Pedoman founded by Rosihan Anwar; Waspada by Ani Idrus, Kartini magazine by Lukman Umar, Femina magazine by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana's descendants, and TV One by Abdul Latief. In Malaysia, Hussamuddin Yaacub is a Minang tycoon that has a print media business. He founded the Karangkraf Group.Antara Rahsia Kejayaan Datuk Hussamuddin Yaacub, Pengasas Kumpulan Karangkraf sinarharian.com.my =Finance= Minangkabau merchants played a part in developing Indonesia's banking industry. Aside from Anwar Sutan Saidi, who founded Bank Nasional in the 1930s, other Minang merchants such as Sutan Sjahsam, the brother of Sutan Sjahrir, were leading figures in capital markets and financial brokerage. During the New Order era, several Minang businessmen involved in the banking business included Hasyim Ning and Anwar Syukur. Notable Minangkabau business people * Hasyim Ning.

He played as a forward. Career Garrett was born in Lesmahagow, South Lanarkshire. He played for Lesmahagow Juniors before coming to England as a 17-year-old to sign for Preston North End. He made his debut in the Football League on 5 February 1938 in the First Division match away against Birmingham. Preston rested players to save them for an FA Cup-tie against Arsenal, so the 18-year-old Garrett came in at inside left, and was part of \\"a footballing feast of delightful, imaginative, attacking football\\" which his club won 2–0. He scored twice in his only other league game for North End before returning to Scotland in December 1938 to join Heart of Midlothian, who paid a club record fee of £4,000 for his services. Hearts had a high-scoring run in the 1939 Scottish Cup: Garrett scored six as they beat junior club Penicuik Athletic and another four as they beat Highland League side Elgin City 14–1. Drawn against Celtic in the Third Round, in what was the first all-ticket match at Tynecastle, Garrett equalised \\"in the dying seconds\\" to earn a replay, which Celtic won 2–1 with a goal that appeared not to have crossed the line. In May and June 1939, Garrett toured North America with a Scottish Football Association XI, scoring 19 goals from 8 matches. In the 1938–39 season he had scored 29 goals in all competitions, of which 17 were in the Scottish League, and 24 (21) the following season, by which time the Second World War was under way. During the war he played a few games for Hearts in the 1943–44 season, and also made guest appearances for Northampton Town and Bristol City.Matthews, p. 89. He returned to Hearts after the war, but his stay was brief: he and teammate Jimmy Briscoe signed for Northampton Town, of the English Third Division South, in September 1946. Garrett maintained his scoring record: in the 1946–47 season he scored 32 goals in all competitions, of which 26 were in the league, and he added another 9 to his league tally before joining Second Division side Birmingham City in November 1947, for what was then a club record fee received of £10,000. He went straight into the starting eleven, but scored only once in his first six games, lost his place, and was unable to regain it. The following season, in the First Division, Garrett had a run of games in place of Harold Bodle: he scored four goals, of which one was the only goal of the game, and two secured 1–1 draws, yet as soon as Bodle became available for selection, Garrett was dropped.Matthews, pp. 183–84. In December 1948, he returned to Northampton Town, where he finished his Football League career at the end of the 1950–51 season. He had spells in non-league football with Wisbech Town and Holbeach United. In the 1960s, Garrett worked for the GPO in Bristol. He died in the city in 1994.

It is the biggest economy in the West African sub region. Given the country’s considerable resource endowment and coastal location there is potential for strong growth. Yet Nigeria has realized very little of this potential. Previous efforts at planning and visioning were not sustained. The history of economic stagnation, declining welfare and social instability, has undermined development for most of the past 30 years. But in recent years, Nigeria has been experiencing a growth turnaround and conditions seem right for launching onto a path of sustained and rapid growth, justifying its ranking amongst the N11 countries. These are the countries identified by Goldman Sachs to have the potential for attaining global competitiveness based on their economic and demographic settings and the foundation for reforms already laid. The previous administration had declared the intention to pursue the vision of placing Nigeria among the 20 largest economies in the world by 2020 and the current administration is committed to the attainment of this vision. Special Interest Groups In order to ensure that all stakeholders across the sectors participate in the Nigeria Vision 2020 processes, thereby guaranteeing peoples' ownership, which is a precondition for any successful development planning, ten Special Interest Groups were formed and tasked with the responsibility of developing Vision documents which cater to and focus on each group. The Special Interest Groups are: * Women * People with Disabilities * Media * Labour * Youth Institutional Arrangement Dr Shamsuddeen Usman, current Minister of National Planning and Deputy Chairman of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria The main organs responsible for the development of the Vision 2020 are; 1\\\\. The National Council on Vision 2020 is at the apex, providing leadership and direction to galvanize the whole nation, with the President as the Chairman. 2\\\\. The National Steering Committee consists of about 70 persons, drawn from the public and private sector, with responsibility for developing the Vision 2020 Implementation Guidelines, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E;) strategy, ensuring a bottom-up approach by which all key stakeholders, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as State, Local Government Areas (LGAs) are encouraged to prepare and implement their “component of the V2020”. The NSC will also develop a template for preparing the V2020 strategic plan. 3\\\\. National Technical Working Group will comprise 20-25 experts in specified thematic areas drawn from both public and private sectors with expertise and passion for the area. They will undertake specific studies or research work to provide data necessary for the working groups report. 4\\\\. The Stakeholder Development Committee includes State Governments, Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other key institutions. The Nigeria Vision 2020 is a bottom-up strategic plan in which each major stakeholder group will prepare its V2020 thoughts and ideas based on the guidelines approved by the National Council. These Committees are expected to provide information that will feed into the NV2020 Plan. The Economic Management Team will serve as Think-Tank to drive the visioning process. The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the EMT are members of the National Council and National Steering Committee on Vision 2020 as well as provide the vital link and feedback from both directions between the National Council and the National Steering Committee. They will therefore provide the vital link and feedback from both bodies. Development Process, Methodology & Milestones The Vision document is to be developed in the following stages: * STAGE I: BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR V2020 (2008–2010) In this stage the first two components of the framework- the NCV2020 and the NSCV2020, should be established by the end of April 2007. The NSC2020 should undertake an immediate review of all current strategy and related documents including the President’s Seven Point Agenda, the NEEDS 2 and other relevant documents and prepare a Statement of National Priorities that will form the core elements of the country’s development plans and budgets during the period 2008 to 2010 and constitute the foundation for V2020. The Statement of National Priorities should set specific targets to be achieved by 2010. The NSCV2020 will also refine the V2020 framework and develop guidelines for the V2020 development process. Stages of the Vision 2020 development process * STAGE II: ACHIEVING THE MDGs ENROUTE TO V2020 (2011 – 2015) By end of January 2008 the NSCV2020 will set up the National Technical Working Groups, one in each of the key areas of national priority and all stakeholder groups will establish their Vision 2020 Committees. Under the overall direction of the NSC, the NTWGs will work closely with the Stakeholder Visioning Committees to develop detailed action plans and implementation strategies and commence implementation of Stage I of the Vision. At the same time Stakeholder Committees will begin the development of the next two stages of their Vision document. Stage II should focus on achieving all the MDGs by 2015 as a general guide. Stakeholder Committees will determine their areas of focus in accordance with their progress on the MDGs. * STAGE III: BECOMING A TOP 20 ECONOMY BY 2020 (2015 – 2020) In stage III, the National Steering Committee will develop detailed key goals and targets that must be met in order to achieve convergence with the projected positions of the top 20 economies. These goals and targets will be cascaded into sectors and sub-national levels. The NTWGs will provide support in the form of data and methodologies as well as capacity building in their areas of specialty. They will also collate and harmonize the various stakeholder action plans and strategies into the National action plan and strategy for NV2020.

Background Sandvik was born on the island of Helgøya in Hedmark, Norway. He was a son of school inspector Paul Knutsen Barstad Sandvik (1847–1936) and his wife Nikoline Petrine Mørk (1847–1927). His parents hailed from Ørsta and Volda. Three years later, his family moved to Hamar where he grew up. He graduated examen artium in 1893. He then began studying at the University of Kristiania. In 1897 he undertook theology studies. He graduated cand.theol. in 1902. He also graduated from the seminary at Hamar (Hamar lærerskole) in 1895. Career Sandvik spent most of his career at the two schools; Vestheim (Vestheim høyere skole) from 1898 to 1913 and Hegdehaugen (Hegdehaugen skole) from 1913 to 1945. He also worked part-time as a singing teacher at the University of Oslo and the MF Norwegian School of Theology, from 1916. He remained at the university until 1947 and at MF until 1952. He took his doctorate in 1921 with the thesis Norsk folkemusik, særlig Østlandsmusikken. This was the first thesis on Norwegian folk music. The thesis was built on several travels in Norway, especially the Gudbrandsdal region, where he collected this music. A polemic took place between Sandvik and colleague Catharinus Elling. Elling held that folk music pieces had to be polished by professionals, whereas Sandvik argued that the music should be played in the tradition of the country folk. Sandvik became vice president of the International Folk Music Council at its inception in 1947. President at the time was Ralph Vaughan Williams. In Norway Sandvik founded the Norwegian Folk Music Research Association in 1948, and chaired the organization from 1948 to 1965. Sandvik also wrote books on church music and choral music. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1939. Personal life In July 1906, he married pianist Nanna Rønneberg Munthe-Kaas (1880–1965). He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1949. In 1966 he was awarded honorary membership in the Norwegian National Association for Traditional Music and Dance. He died in Oslo, having reached the age of 101 and was buried at the cemetery of Ris Church.

Kirwan was a member of one of The Tribes of Galway, and was noted by contemporaries as an outstanding preacher. Biography He was appointed parish priest of Kilcummin (Oughterard in 1827, from about which time he had been canvassing for office in a proposed Queen's College for Galway. This was a highly emotive issue in Ireland, as it was felt that the Catholic population could not, and should not, propagate a system of education not endorsed by their clergy. However, when the bill was eventually passed in 1845, Kirwin immediately travelled to London to argue his case with Sir Robert Peel, who was sufficiently impressed to nominate him. To the shock of much of his community and friends, he was appointed President in October or November 1845. While there was support, it was outweighed by the venom of his critics. Nevertheless, he began with the chairman of the board of works and the commissioner for buildings to inspect sites. A site was selected outside the town, between the Corrib and the Newcastle road; once purchased, construction began. Meanwhile, personal attacks continued, such as those from the editor of the Catholic weekly, The Tablet, while the Holy See still maintained its opposition to the colleges. At one point in late 1848 Kirwan was distressed enough by events to offer his resignation, but was dissuaded, apparently by the then Archbishop of Armagh, William Crolly, who was a staunch supporter of the scheme. Nevertheless, the strain took a toll on his health, and he was obliged to spend some months out of the public eye. Problems had emerged with the College's construction, as it became apparent that he would not be completed in time for the formal opening. Matters turned tragic on 22 October 1849 when the contractor, Francis Burke, killed himself in Kirwan's home in Salthill. Nevertheless, the College opened on 30 October 1849. But Kirwan's precarious health worsened, and he died on 24 December 1849. He was buried in the parish church of Oughterard. A portrait of Kirwan hangs in the board-room of the National University of Ireland, Galway. References * The Appointment of Revd J.W.

It is open daily; park admission is free but a fee is charged for Botanika. The botanical garden dates to 1905 when it was created by businessman Ernst Franz Schütte at a different site (1905 Osterdeich, 3 hectares). This original garden was organized geographically, with plants from the Orient, Mexico, and the Caucasus, as well as collections of crop plants, medicinal herbs, native plants, and poisonous plants. It remained privately held until 1935 when it became city property, and was transferred to its current location within the Rhododendron Park over the next few years. Today's garden was completed in 1949-1950. The park itself began in 1933 at the initiative of the German Rhododendron Society on former farmland and forest, opening to the public in 1937. Its Botanika facility, described as Germany's largest nature center, opened in 2003. In 2007 ownership of the park was transferred to a nonprofit foundation.  Azaleas and rhododendrons  The park's azalea and rhododendron collections are as follows: * Azalea park - a large landscaped park with streams and lawns, displaying azaleas under old beech and oak trees. Collections include wild species from North America, and historic and current cultivars from the Czech Republic, Germany, and the United States. * Rhododendron forest - an old, densely vegetated part of the park, with the first rhododendrons planted in 1936. * Rhododendron park - more than 2,000 varieties of rhododendrons and azaleas. * New cultivars - new varieties of rhododendrons by German breeders, renewed every 5 years with the assistance of the Deutschen Rhododendron-Gesellschaft (DRG).

It started in the 1960s and 1970s when Episcopalians and Lutherans, and offered Cursillo. In 1978, The Upper Room of the General Board of Discipleship of the United Methodist Church trademarked Emmaus and adapted it into a primarily Protestant version. History In the Catholic Church Emmaus began for women in 1978, with the approval of the Archdiocese of Miami. It was developed and conducted by a team of laywomen from St. Louis Church in Kendall (Miami). Father David G. Russell, who was pastor at that time, saw the need for, and envisioned, a parish-based retreat that enabled lay women to minister to lay women. He approached the secretariat of the Cursillo movement and asked if they would allow a parish-based Cursillo to be held at St. Louis. This request was denied. Since there was no other retreat of this type available at that time, Father Russell asked the Directress of Religious Education, Myrna Gallagher, to form a team and develop one. After intense prayer and much thought, it was established that the theme of the retreat would be based on the Scripture passage found in the Gospel of Luke 24:13-35, the Emmaus Reading. In early 1985, Fr. Fetscher of St. Louis asked Jim Loretta from St. Louis Catholic Church, to look at starting a Men’s version of the Emmaus Retreat experience that Myrna Gallagher had started back in 1978. Jim Loretta and Larry Barfield along with other men developed a men’s version of what Myrna Gallagher had done with the women. On February 14, 1986, the first Men's Emmaus was held at the Dominican Retreat House. Eventually, one of the candidates from a previous weekend called to say they would like to have the same retreat at St. Brendan’s Catholic Church. Larry Barfield from St. Louis went to St. Brendan’s and put on the first \\"not at St. Louis\\" Men's Emmaus weekend, held at the youth center next to Mercy Hospital in Coconut Grove. Thereafter, Jim Loretta in February 14, 1988, put on the first Emmaus an event at St. John Neumann Catholic Church, and the program expanded thenceforth. Since that first Men’s Emmaus in 1986, Mens Emmaus retreats have spread throughout the entire United States, every country in Central and South America, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, and even to Shanghai, China. A retreat was even held underground in Cuba 2012. As of 2020, there have been numerous men’s and women’s Emmaus retreats in Cuba. Emmaus Retreats are different from the Catholic Cursillo. Cursillo aims to form \\"Catholic leaders\\" from those Catholics already on a walk with the Lord. Emmaus reaches out to all Christians who are members of church. Participants are encouraged to find ways to live out their individual call to discipleship in their home, church, and community.(cite weburl=http://emmaus.upperroom.org/about) Today Emmaus retreats are held worldwide. Biblical reference The name of the movement comes from the Gospel of Luke 24:13-35 (KJV). In this passage, a follower of Jesus of Nazareth named Cleopas, also identified as Simon, and another unnamed traveler leave Jerusalem for the town of Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. On the journey the two travelers encounter an unnamed man who asks about the happenings over the past few days in Jerusalem concerning Jesus of Nazareth. Cleopas and his companion describe the events of that week. They tell about Jesus' trial, crucifixion, and burial. They also share that some of the women who followed Jesus discovered the tomb in which Jesus was buried empty. The unnamed man then proceeds to explain the writings of the prophet Moses concerning God's Messiah or Christ. When the three travelers reach Emmaus, they share a meal. During the blessings of the meal, it is revealed to Cleopas and his companion that the unnamed man who accompanied them is none other than Jesus whom God has raised from the dead. In that moment of recognition, Jesus disappears from their presence. Cleopas and his companion immediately return to Jerusalem to tell the other followers of Jesus that he has appeared to Simon in his resurrected, glorified body. Luke also records that the moment of recognition of the resurrected Jesus was in the blessing and breaking of bread, a reference to the Passover seder Jesus shared with his disciples commonly known as the Last Supper. Also, it is a reference to the Christian sacrament or ordinance or act of worship known among different branches of Christianity as Eucharist or Holy Communion or Lord's Supper.

The species was first described by Achille Guenée in 1852. It can be found in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains; it occurs west at least to Oklahoma and north at least to Illinois. It also ranges into southern Canada, but only barely so.Nelson, John M. & Loy, Peter W. (1983). \\"The Underwing Moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) of Oklahoma\\". Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science. 63: 60-67. Description and ecology The wingspan is 70–85 mm. The forewings are dark purplish brown above, and light cream below. The hindwings have a deep scarlet-pink ground color with a pattern of two clean concentric blackish bands per wing, one through the midwing and one along the pale outer margin. The hindwing base is heavily covered in dark hairs; at a casual glance it may thus appear as if at the center of the dark bands there is a black spot or streak. As in many relatives, the foreleg tibia of this species possess no spines, while the tarsi carry three rows of spines.Nelson & Loy (1983) The adult moths flies from June to October depending on the location. The caterpillars feed on Populus (poplar and cottonwood) and Salix (willow) species, especially black willow (S. nigra). Classification This moth is placed in the subfamily Catocalinae, either of the owlet moth family, Noctuidae, or - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed more strictly - of family Erebidae. Within the Catocalinae, it belongs to tribe Catocalini and - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed widely - subtribe Catocalina. The former subspecies C. c. carissima, which occurs to the south of the darling underwing, is now again considered to be a valid species Catocala carissima (carissima underwing); this also includes the supposed species C. silvia, which actually is merely a form with no formal taxonomic standing.

Attendance has grown steadily, with the 2008 event hosting nearly twenty thousand visitors. This rise in visitors led to the rebranding of the event in 2009, which included the show being extended in length from one day to two, held on the weekend of 20 June. The event is one of three annual air shows that take place at Cotswold Airport, on which construction began in 1936, along with the Great Vintage Flying Weekend in May and the Battle of Britain Airshow in September. The two other events are held towards the northern edge of the airport, whilst the Cotswold Air Show is held towards the southern edge of the site, allowing for a much larger showground. The Red Arrows, the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force, were initially based at the aerodrome, and the airport is known as the team's \\"spiritual home\\". Because of this heritage, the event is one of the few airshows in the United Kingdom that receives special support from the Royal Air Force, as a 'Priority 1' event. Unlike many other air shows, where the flying displays continue uninterrupted, the flying displays at the Cotswold Air Show are stopped in the middle of the day for a lunch break. The event has become well known among aviation enthusiasts for flypasts of aircraft in unusual formations, which have become known as \\"Kemble Moments\\". In 2009, aircraft belonging to the US Air Force appeared for the first time at the event. The year also saw the debut of the restored Vulcan bomber, a project that cost over £6m over 15 years. In 2010, the event commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, featuring aircraft including the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane. The event was held to raise money for the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund. 2010 also featured a display named 'O'Brien's Flying Circus', which on the second display was not carried out successfully. The pilot of a light aircraft was meant to land on a trailer, but because of crosswinds, after multiple attempts they were unable to do and made a conventional landing on the runway. The event also featured aircraft from the Battle of Britain, featuring pyrotechnics and audio effects.

Entanglement being at the core of QI, this work has stimulated applications of Quantum Statistics in QI processing, apart from being used in studies on free electron Quantum Computation. (b) A hitherto unexplored use of intraparticle path-spin entanglement was conceived for empirically verifying Quantum Contextuality, subsequently tested by the Vienna group, followed recently by suggesting its information-theoretic applications. (c) A widely cited analysis of the Quantum Zeno effect (Annals of Physics 258, 237 (1997)), preceded by the formulation of a unified framework for such effects (Physics Letters A 173, 327 (1993)). (d) Proposed a novel experiment to show simultaneous wave and particle – like behaviour in the same setup using optical tunneling of single photon states (Physics Letters A 153, 403 (1991)), subsequently tested (Physics Letters A 168, 1 (1992)) at Hamamatsu Photonics laboratory, Japan. (e) Conceived an innovative biomolecular example to probe the Quantum Measurement Problem (Physical Review Letters 76, 2836 (1996)), preceded by a demonstration of the quantum mechanical violation of classical realism for multiparticle systems even under strong macroscopic limiting conditions (Physical Review A 52, 4959 (1995)).

Hence, if: Oq_j\\\\rangle=O\\\\sum_k c_{k,j}(0) e_k\\\\rangle = q_j q_j\\\\rangle then we require ::O\\\\sum_k c_{k,j}(0) \\\\exp(-i e_k t/\\\\hbar)\\\\,e_k\\\\rangle=q_j\\\\sum_k c_{k,j}(0) \\\\exp(-i e_k t/\\\\hbar)\\\\,e_k\\\\rangle for all eigenvectors q_j\\\\rangle in order to call q a good quantum number (where e_k\\\\rangles and e_ks represent the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, respectively). In other words, the eigenvalues q_j are good quantum numbers if the corresponding operator O is a constant of motion (commutes with the time evolution). Good quantum numbers are often used to label initial and final states in experiments. For example, in particle colliders: 1\\\\. Particles are initially prepared in approximate momentum eigenstates; the particle momentum being a good quantum number for non-interacting particles. 2\\\\. The particles are made to collide. At this point, the momentum of each particle is undergoing change and thus the particles’ momenta are not a good quantum number for the interacting particles during the collision. 3\\\\. A significant time after the collision, particles are measured in momentum eigenstates. Momentum of each particle has stabilized and is again a good quantum number a long time after the collision. Theorem: A necessary and sufficient condition for q (which is an eigenvalue of an operator O) to be good is that O commutes with the Hamiltonian H. Proof: Assume [O,\\\\,H]=0. :: If \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle is an eigenvector of O, then we have (by definition) that O \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle=q_j  \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle, and so : ::O\\\\psi_t\\\\rangle=O\\\\,T(t)\\\\,\\\\psi_0\\\\rangle ::=O e^{-itH/\\\\hbar}\\\\psi_0\\\\rangle ::= O \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n!} (-i H t/\\\\hbar)^{n} \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle ::= \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n!} (-i H t/\\\\hbar)^{n} O \\\\psi_0\\\\rangle :: =q_j \\\\psi_t\\\\rangle. \\\\quad \\\\square Ehrenfest Theorem and Good Quantum Numbers The Ehrenfest Theorem gives the rate of change of the expectation value of operators. It reads as follows: :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle A(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial A(t)}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar}\\\\langle[A(t),H]\\\\rangle Commonly occurring operators don't depend explicitly on time. If such operators commute with the Hamiltonian, then their expectation value remains constant with time. Now, if the system is in one of the common eigenstates of the operatorA (and H too), then the system remains in this eigenstate as time progresses. Any measurement of the quantity A will give us the eigenvalue (or the good quantum number) associated with the eigenstates in which the particle is. This is actually a statement of conservation in quantum mechanics, and will be elaborated in more detail below. Conservation in Quantum Mechanics Case I: Stronger statement of conservation: When the system is in one of the common eigenstates of H and A Let A be an operator which commutes with the Hamiltonian H. This implies that we can have common eigenstates of A and H. Assume that our system is in one of these common eigenstates. If we measure of A, it will definitely yield an eigenvalue of A (the good quantum number). Also, it is a well-known result that an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is a stationary state, which means that even if the system is left to evolve for some time before the measurement is made, it will still yield the same eigenvalue. Therefore, If our system is in a common eigenstate, its eigenvalues of A (good quantum numbers) won't change with time. Conclusion: If [A,H]=0 and the system is in a common eigenstate of A and H, the eigenvalues of A (good quantum numbers) don't change with time. Case II: Weaker statement of conservation: When the system is not in any of the common eigenstates of H and A As assumed in case I, [A,H]=0. But now the system is not in any of the common eigenstates of H and A. So the system must be in some linear combination of the basis formed by the common eigenstates of H and A. When a measurement of A is made, it can yield any of the eigenvalues of A. And then, if any number of subsequent measurements of A are made, they are bound to yield the same result. In this case, a (weaker) statement of conservation holds: Using the Ehrenfest Theorem, [A,H]=0 doesn't explicitly depend on time: \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\langle A\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\hbar}\\\\langle[A,H]\\\\rangle = 0 This says that the expectation value of A remains constant in time. When the measurement is made on identical systems again and again, it will generally yield different values, but the expectation value remains constant. This is a weaker conservation condition than the case when our system was a common eigenstate of A and H: The eigenvalues of A are not ensured to remain constant, only its expectation value. Conclusion: If [A,H]=0, A doesn't explicitly depend on time and the system isn't in a common eigenstate of A and H, the expectation value of A is conserved, but the conservation of the eigenvalues of A is not ensured. Analogy with Classical Mechanics In classical mechanics, the total time derivative of a physical quantity A is given as: : \\\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\\\\\{A, H\\\\\\\\} where the curly braces refer to Poisson bracket of A and H. This bears a striking resemblance to the Ehrenfest Theorem. It implies that a physical quantity A is conserved if its Poisson Bracket with the Hamiltonian vanishes and the quantity does not depend on time explicitly. This condition in classical mechanics is analogous to the condition in quantum mechanics for the conservation of an observable (as implied by Ehrenfest Theorem: Poisson bracket is replaced by commutator) Systems which can be labelled by good quantum numbers Systems which can be labelled by good quantum numbers are actually eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. They are also called stationary states. They are so called because the system remains in the same state as time elapses, in every observable way. The states changes mathematically, since the complex phase factor attached to it changes continuously with time, but it can't be observed. Such a state satisfies: :\\\\hat H \\\\Psi\\\\rangle=E_{\\\\Psi} \\\\Psi\\\\rangle, where *\\\\Psi\\\\rangle is a quantum state, which is a stationary state; *\\\\hat H is the Hamiltonian operator; *E_{\\\\Psi} is the energy eigenvalue of the state \\\\Psi\\\\rangle. The evolution of the state ket is governed by the Schrödinger Equation: :i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\Psi\\\\rangle = E_{\\\\Psi}\\\\Psi\\\\rangle It gives the time evolution of the state of the system as: :\\\\Psi(t)\\\\rangle = e^{-iE_{\\\\Psi}t/\\\\hbar}\\\\Psi(0)\\\\rangle Examples = The hydrogen atom = In non-relativistic treatment, l and s are good quantum numbers but in relativistic quantum mechanics they are no longer good quantum numbers as L and S do not commute with H (in Dirac theory). J=L+S is a good quantum number in relativistic quantum mechanics as J commutes with H. The hydrogen atom: no spin-orbit coupling In the case of the hydrogen atom (with the assumption that there is no spin-orbit coupling), the observables that commute with Hamiltonian are the orbital angular momentum, spin angular momentum, the sum of the spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum, and the z components of the above angular momenta. Thus, the good quantum numbers in this case, (which are the eigenvalues of these observables) are l, j, m_\\\\text{l} , m_s, m_j. We have omitted s, since it always is constant for an electron and carries no significance as far the labeling of states is concerned. Good quantum numbers and CSCO However, all the good quantum numbers in the above case of the hydrogen atom (with negligible spin-orbit coupling), namely l, j, m_\\\\text{l} , m_s, m_j can't be used simultaneously to specify a state. Here is when CSCO (Complete set of commuting observables) comes into play. Here are some general results which are of general validity : 1\\\\. A certain number of good quantum numbers can be used to specify uniquely a certain quantum state only when the observables corresponding to the good quantum numbers form a CSCO. 2\\\\. If the observables commute, but don't form a CSCO, then their good quantum numbers refer to a set of states. In this case they don't refer to a state uniquely. 3\\\\. If the observables don't commute they can't even be used to refer to any set of states, let alone refer to any unique state. In the case of hydrogen atom, the L^2, J^2 , L_z , J_z don't form a commuting set. But n, l, m_\\\\text{l}, m_s are the quantum numbers of a CSCO. So, are in this case, they form a set of good quantum numbers. Similarly, n, l, j, m_\\\\text{j} too form a set of good quantum numbers. The hydrogen atom: spin-orbit interaction included If the spin orbit interaction is taken into account, we have to add an extra term in Hamiltonian which represents the magnetic dipole interaction energy. :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{SO} =-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{B}. Now, the new Hamiltonian with this new \\\\Delta H_\\\\text{SO} term doesn't commute with \\\\boldsymbol{L} and \\\\boldsymbol{S}; but it does commute with L2, S2 and \\\\boldsymbol{J} , which is the total angular momentum. In other words, l, j, m_\\\\text{l}, m_s are no longer good quantum numbers, but l, j , m_\\\\text{j} are. And since, good quantum numbers are used to label the eigenstates, the relevant formulae of interest are expressed in terms of them. For example, the spin-orbit interaction energy is given by :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{SO}= {\\\\beta\\\\over 2}(j(j+1) - l(l+1) -s(s+1)) where :\\\\beta = \\\\beta (n,l) = Z^4{\\\\mu_0\\\\over 4{\\\\pi}^4}g_\\\\text{s}\\\\mu_\\\\text{B}^2{1\\\\over n^3a_0^3l(l+1/2)(l+1)} As we can see, the above expressions contain the good quantum numbers, namely l,s, j See also * Complete set of commuting observables * Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) * Stationary state * Constant of motion * Quantum number * Measurement in quantum mechanics * Ehrenfest theorem * Operator (physics) References Category:Quantum mechanics ","title":"Good quantum number"},{"id":"23191448","text":"Shake Down is the debut studio album by the British blues rock band Savoy Brown.

After being demobilized in 1817, it was reorganized again in 1823, from that time various changes in its name were experimented with, until 5 December 1851. On that date it received the best official recognition of its value, it was converted to a Veteran Corps -- a regular unit -- with the designation Prince's Regiment. This distinction, practically without precedents in the history of the entire Spanish colonial army, known as the Overseas Army, reflects the exceptional quality of this unit. The emergence of the First Republic involved an important series of changes in the designation of Units: substitutions for those with monarchial connotations. By the decree of 1 July 1873 the Sixth Prince's Regiment became the Visayas Regiment. Toward the end of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines, the Philippine army, which had always been separate from the Spanish Army, became integrated with the metropolitan army. As a result, the Visayas Regiment became the Seventy-second of the Spanish army. In 1896, the year the Revolution began, the Seventy-second Visayas Regiment was deployed in Manila and the military posts of the Visayas, and existed until 1898.

A significantly deeper form argues that the fact that the dual notion of a limit is a colimit allows us to change the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for homology to give axioms for cohomology. It is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton.  Discussion  An example is given by currying, which tells us that for any object X, a map X \\\\times I \\\\to Y is the same as a map X \\\\to Y^I, where Y^I is the exponential object, given by all maps from I to Y . In the case of topological spaces, if we take I to be the unit interval, this leads to a duality between X \\\\times I and Y^I, which then gives a duality between the reduced suspension \\\\Sigma X, which is a quotient of X \\\\times I, and the loop space \\\\Omega Y, which is a subspace of Y^I. This then leads to the adjoint relation \\\\langle \\\\Sigma X, Y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle X, \\\\Omega Y \\\\rangle, which allows the study of spectra, which give rise to cohomology theories. We can also directly relate fibrations and cofibrations: a fibration p \\\\colon E \\\\to B is defined by having the homotopy lifting property, represented by the following diagram center and a cofibration i \\\\colon A \\\\to X is defined by having the dual homotopy extension property, represented by dualising the previous diagram: center The above considerations also apply when looking at the sequences associated to a fibration or a cofibration, as given a fibration F \\\\to E \\\\to B we get the sequence :\\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\Omega^2 B \\\\to \\\\Omega F \\\\to \\\\Omega E \\\\to \\\\Omega B \\\\to F \\\\to E \\\\to B \\\\, and given a cofibration A \\\\to X \\\\to X/A we get the sequence : A \\\\to X \\\\to X/A \\\\to \\\\Sigma A \\\\to \\\\Sigma X \\\\to \\\\Sigma \\\\left (X/A \\\\right ) \\\\to \\\\Sigma^2 A \\\\to \\\\cdots. \\\\, and more generally, the duality between the exact and coexact Puppe sequences. This also allows us to relate homotopy and cohomology: we know that homotopy groups are homotopy classes of maps from the n-sphere to our space, written \\\\pi_n(X,p) \\\\cong \\\\langle S^n,X \\\\rangle, and we know that the sphere has a single nonzero (reduced) cohomology group. On the other hand, cohomology groups are homotopy classes of maps to spaces with a single nonzero homotopy group. This is given by the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(G,n) and the relation : H^n(X;G) \\\\cong \\\\langle X,K(G,n) \\\\rangle. A formalization of the above informal relationships is given by Fuks duality.

Early life and family  Compton was born to Edmund Compton, involved in South American trade, and a mother from a clerical background. He was schooled at Rugby where he had won a scholarship and developed a love of music. At Oxford University Compton became acquainted with the renowned historian and educationalist H. A. L. Fisher, who was the Warden of New College. Compton was among the undergraduates (of whom Richard Crossman was one) invited by Fisher to socialise with the likes of Gilbert Murray, Hilaire Belloc, General Smuts and David Lloyd George. It was during this time that Compton determined to enter public service. In 1934, he married Betty Tresyllian Williams (d. 1987), of a Quaker carpet-making family from Kidderminster. They had one son and four daughters, of whom the youngest is Isobel Sidney, Viscountess De L'Isle. Civil service Compton entered the civil service in 1929 and was transferred to the Colonial Service, during which he visited Nigeria. In 1931 he was transferred to the Treasury where he developed a reputation as a very capable civil servant. At the beginning of the Second World War, Compton was seconded to the Ministry of Aircraft Production where he served as the Private Secretary to the Minister, Lord Beaverbrook. Returning to the Treasury in 1942, Compton became known as an effective wartime operator. In peacetime, Compton continued his ascent through the Treasury, being appointed in turn Third Secretary in 1949 and Comptroller and Auditor General in 1958. In these roles he demonstrated characteristics of dependability and versatility. He was described by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, John Boyd- Carpenter as being \\"enormously knowledgeable on public finance\\". Ombudsman At the 1964 general election, Labour pledged to establish an office to handle complaints against government departments. In 1967, the Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed Compton to be first Parliamentary Commissioner (or 'Ombudsman'). Wilson trusted Compton to navigate the Office through its formative years. He previously worked with Compton when he had been Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and described him as \\"one of the shrewdest, cleverest, and nicest, men in Whitehall\\". Compton, he said, taught him \\"a very great deal about how government operates in Britain\\". The challenge Compton faced was to establish the Office in the face of considerable public scepticism about its efficacy. The media described the Office as pointless and ludicrously emasculated and Compton as a swordless crusader.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), p.125 Compton busied himself recruiting staff during 1966 and 1967 and formulated the structure and operating procedures of the Office. He drew upon his previous experience, using the Exchequer and Audit Department of the Treasury as a model. Staff were borrowed from other departments and legal advice procured from the Treasury Solicitor's Department. Compton sought civil servants with enquiring minds and the ability to size up cases and people rather than the ability to organise or to plan.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), p.127 Compton also pioneered an investigation procedure that was to remain unchanged for thirty years and was unique among Ombudsman schemes. The procedure involved a ten part jurisdiction test of complaints, a two-stage investigation process and a final reporting stage. Compton took a low-key approach to his work, making limited efforts to publicise the Office. As a result, the number of cases handled by the Office was low from the outset and diminished further. The practice of publishing anonymised reports on an annual basis often long after the events described attracted criticism that this garnered too little publicity for the Office. =Sachsenhausen= Compton investigated the first major case to be referred to the Office. Former prisoners of war of Sachsenhausen concentration camp complained that they had been denied compensation by the Foreign Office in its administration of a scheme to compensate victims of Nazi persecution. Their complaint was referred to the Office by Airey Neave MP, who had himself escaped from Colditz during the war. The Foreign Office had concluded that the complainants were not entitled to compensation having been imprisoned outside the camp proper. It considered the treatment of the complainants to have been comparable to a breach of the Geneva Convention rather than the systematic brutality of a 'normal' concentration camp.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), p.161 Compton concluded that there were defects in the administrative procedure by which the Foreign Office had decided to reject the claims. He found that the reputation of the complainants had suffered as a result and that this constituted injustice. Compton thought that the result of his investigation would serve to vindicate their claims and affirm their sincerity. In the House of Commons debate that followed the report in February 1968 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs George Brown defended the position of the Foreign Office while announcing his intention to pay compensation to the complainants. Brown asserted that there had been no bungling or blundering by the Foreign Office and that the issue was merely one of judgment. Members expressed little support for the begrudging way in which Brown had agreed to pay compensation. The Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration endorsed the findings of the report and rejected the contentions of the Foreign Office. Having adversely reported against the Foreign Office and secured a remedy for the complainants, Compton had enhanced the reputation of the Office and demonstrated that it would be able to address wrongs done by less weightier departments. Compton had also proven incorrect critics of the Office who had doubted its ability to confront departmental injustice. Boundaries and the BBC Following his tenure as Ombudsman, Compton served as the Chairman of the Boundary Commission between 1971 and 1978. He was then Chairman of the Programmes Complaints Commission at the British Broadcasting Corporation between 1972 and 1981 where he was distinctly even-handed between the public and imaginative programme producers. Compton died in 1994 and was described by Tam Dalyell MP as a very considerable public servant of the British state.

Ann Abraham was born in 1952 and attended Kingsfield Grammar School in Bristol. She studied at Bedford College, London, graduating in German and philosophy in 1974. She was a housing manager between 1979 and 1980, first for Tower Hamlets Council and then for Islington Council. She then joined the Housing Corporation in 1981, serving until 1990 as a regional director and then operations director. She became the Chief executive of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in 1991, serving until 1997, when she became the Legal Services Ombudsman. Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman In 2002, Ann Abraham succeeded Sir Michael Buckley as Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Her tenure as Ombudsman saw a major effort to focus the efforts of Government departments on providing good administration, departing from the traditional focus on avoiding maladministration. She confronted the Government over several serious acts of maladministration, which led to an unprecedented tabling of reports under s10(3) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 in which the Ombudsman reports that injustice caused by maladministration has not is not likely to be remedied. She also maximised her powers under s10(4) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 to issue special reports in order highlights significant examples of maladministration by the Government. She finished her term as Ombudsman in December 2011 and was succeeded by Dame Julie Mellor. =NHS continuing care= The first special report published by Abraham under s10(4) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 concerned NHS funding for long-term care. Two reports had previously been issued on the subject by Sir William Reid, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman between 1990 and 1996. It was found by Reid that the National Health Service had failed to make long-term care available to patients with mental and physical health needs. There were also failings in how health authorities had set the eligibility criteria for funding. The report published by Abraham in February 2003 was strongly critical of the Department of Health. It was found that numerous health authorities were using criteria that was too restrictive in determining eligibility for funding for NHS care that was not in line with that laid down by the Department after the judgment in ex parte Coughlan.R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213, Abraham found that the cost of caring for patients with very severe disabilities was left to relatives instead of the National Health Service.Health Service Commissioner, Second Report 2002–03, E.420/00-01; E.1626/01-02. She recommended the Department take a strong lead in providing a \\"very clear, well defined national framework\\" for determining eligibility. This the Government undertook to do, as well as a retrospective review of cases that it had determined. The backlog of retrospective review cases grew to such an extent that Abraham took the decision in June 2004 to accept cases directly without complainants having to exhaust the NHS complaints procedure. In a follow-up report in December 2004, Abraham criticised the shortcomings which she had discovered in the retrospective review process. Record keeping was often poor, decisions were sometimes taken without clinical advice and review processes were sometimes secretive. Once again, Abraham insisted on a national framework for criteria and recommended the development of good practice guidance to support the criteria.Health Service Commissioner, First Report 2004–05. Thereafter, the Office engaged deeply with the Department and the health authorities to ensure that cases were properly assessed according to criteria. The Department published its national framework for determining funding eligibility in June 2007 and the number of NHS continuing care cases being handled by the Office shrunk from 1,500 in November 2007 to just 100 in March 2008.Health Service Commissioner, Annual Report 2007-08, pp. 45–48. Through its rigorous reporting and active engagement with the Department, the Office under Ann Abraham had helped bring about service improvement in the NHS and provide justice to those wrongly denied funding. =Trusting in the pensions promise= A significant number of complaints were received by members of wound-up final salary occupational pension schemes who learned that the funds of which they had been members were insufficiently funded. They complained that official information provided by the Government about the security of the pension schemes was misleading and that warnings were not provided about the risks to the schemes in response to an actuarial recommendation in 2000 that such a warning be given. In March 2006, Abraham published a report into the matter – titled Trusting in the Pensions Promise – under s10(3) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 following referrals by more than 200 MPs. She found that official information provided by the Government was often inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent; that the response to the actuarial recommendation was maladministration; and a decision to change the minimum funding requirement was done maladministratively. Complainants had sustained a sense of outrage, had lost opportunities to make informed choices or take remedial action and had suffered distress, anxiety and uncertainty. She made five recommendations, including that the Government consider arranging for the restoration of the pensions benefits.Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Sixth Report 2005-06 The Government rejected the report, insisting that the case for maladministration was not found out and that it was not in the public interest to compensate the pension schemes. In response, Abraham expressed disappointment at the Government's attitude and commented that it raised doubts about the commitment of the Government to the Ombudsman scheme.Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Annual Report 2005-06, p4 To the Select Committee, she noted that she sought to constructively engage with the Government: \\"it is maladministration, get over it and let us get on to engagement with the real issues here\\"Public Administration Select Committee, 28 June 2006. The Select Committee supported Abraham, issuing a report which found that the Government bore some responsibility for compensating those affected. The Government reiterated its position and legal action by complainants followed. In the Court of Appeal it was held in February 2008 that the Government could not reject the findings of the Ombudsman without reason. The Government was compelled to reconsider Abraham's recommendation that arrangements be made to restore pension benefits.R (on the application of Bradley) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2008] EWCA Civ 36; 3 All ER 1116. It made parallel moves to improve the Financial Assistance Scheme which provided assistance to those whose pension schemes had begun to wind up. After pressure from the Select Committee, it was ultimately decided by the Government in December 2007 to guarantee the Financial Assistance Scheme to 90%. Abraham welcomed this move as compliance with her key recommendations, although the Government did not acknowledge acceptance of her findings. =Equitable life= In July 2008, Abraham published a report into the regulatory failure of the Government in its oversight of Equitable Life, which verged on collapse in 2000 and left more than a million policyholders with significantly reduced retirement savings. Equitable Life had admitted that its customers' investments were worth £3 billion more than the company's total assets, leading to insurers slashing the policies. Abraham found ten instances of maladministration and held that the Government had failed to use the powers available to it to protect the policyholders. She criticised the Government for failing to verify the solvency of Equitable Life and failing to make sure that the information available to the public was reliable. The title of the report – A Decade of Regulatory Failure – served to emphasise the seriousness of the maladministration. Among the departments rebuked by her report was the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority, the Government Actuary's Department and the Department of Trade and Industry. She recommended that a compensation scheme be established to put people in the position they would have been in but for the maladministration. The Select Committee reinforced Abraham's position in December 2008, calling on the Government to comply with the report's recommendations. When the Government announced in January 2009 that it would assist those \\"hardest hit\\" by the collapse, Abraham declared its attitude to be \\"astonishing\\". The Government was \\"strong on assertion... short on facts\\" and was \\"re-arranging the evidence, re-doing the analysis and acting as judge on its own behalf\\". Once again, the Select Committee supported the Ombudsman, expressing disappointment at the Government's scheme of remedy. It labelled the Government \\"shabby, constitutionally dubious and procedurally improper\\" in its rejection of the recommendations. Abraham published a follow-up report in May 2009, Injustice Unremedied,http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/improving-public-service/reports-and- consultations/reports/parliamentary/injustice-unremedied-the-governments- response-on-equitable-life2 . under s10(3) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 criticising the Government for rejecting her findings. She commented that the Government attitude \\"begged a rather larger question as to what the purpose of regulation was supposed to be\\". In May 2010, the Government announced that it would propose a Bill to implement her recommendations. However, in July 2010 it announced that an independent commission would advise how compensation would be paid and that it could include recommendations by the retired judge Sir John Chadwick, whose methodology was rejected by Abraham. His proposals, she said, \\"would not in any sense enable fair and transparent compensation to be delivered\\". In October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced that compensation of £1.5 billion would be paid, a settlement called \\"woefully inadequate\\" by campaigners. =Ombudsman's Principles= A major initiative of Ann Abraham was that of the Ombudsman's Principles, an attempt to prevent instances of maladministration by promoting good administration. The work on developing the Principles of Good Administration began in 2005, with the Principles being progressively reduced in number and clarified for ease of understanding. By 2006, the Principles that she sought to promote in Government departments were agreed upon as \\"Getting it right\\", \\"Being customer focused\\", \\"Being open and accountable\\", \\"Acting fairly and proportionately\\", \\"Putting things right\\" and \\"Seeking continuous improvement\\". In March 2007, the Principles of Good Administration were published, being welcomed by the Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell. The Cabinet Office had already stated that the Principles \\"represent common sense and good practice and that they are written in a way which staff will find relevant and helpful to their work\\".\\"Principles of Good Administration: Response to Consultation\\" , Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Abraham declared in June 2008 that the Principles were consistent with the original intention of the establishment of the Office – to \\"humanise the bureaucracy of the state\\".http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/ombudsmans- speeches/2008/sp2008-02 . She followed up the publication of the Principles of Good Administration with the Principles for Remedy in October 2007, announcing that they would help public bodies \\"to have to hand the tools to put things right themselves\\". The Principles of Good Complaint Handling were published in November 2008 as guidance to help public authorities resolve complaints before they reached the Office. All three sets of Principles were published as a trilogy in February 2009 as the Ombudsman's Principles,\\"Ombudsman's Principles\\", Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. encapsulating the case experience of the Office since its establishment in 1967. =A Debt of Honour and Defending the Indefensible= Abraham investigated complaints made by British groups who had been interned by the Japanese during the Second World War. They complained about a compensation scheme established by the Government in 2000 in which £10,000 would be offered to surviving members of groups who had been held prisoner. The Defence Minister, Dr Lewis Moonie, announced that \\"British groups\\", \\"British citizens\\" and \\"UK citizens\\" would be eligible for compensation. The clarification of this requirement was that a claimant had to have been born in the United Kingdom or had a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom – the \\"bloodlink\\". Complaints were made by many who considered themselves British who could not meet the criteria, including the political scientist Professor Jack Hayward, born in Shanghai to a father born in India and a mother born in Iraq. Abraham published her report – A Debt of Honour (after a phrase used by Dr Moonie) – in July 2005. She found four instances of maladministration: the scheme was devised hurriedly and with a lack of clarity about eligibility; that the announcement of the scheme was so imprecise as to give rise to confusion; that there was a failure to ensure that the \\"bloodlink\\" requirement would not lead to unequal treatment; and that there was a failure to inform applicants about the \\"bloodlink2 clarification when they were sent an eligibility questionnaire. The report recommended that the scheme be reviewed so that it would not operate in a way that would unequally treat Hayward and others in a similar situation. The report was published under s10(3) as the Government only partially accepted the recommendations but refused to accept that there had been inequality of treatment or to review the scheme. The Select Committee published its own report on the matter, endorsing the recommendations of Abraham, in January 2006. In March 2006 the Ministry of Defence announced that it had made changes to the eligibility criteria, abandoning the \\"bloodlink\\" requirement and paving the way for Hayward and others to become eligible for compensation. A postscript to the affair was provided by the \\"injury to feelings\\" scheme announced by the Government in June 2007 in which claimants could apply for compensation for the discrimination they had suffered under the original scheme as a result of the \\"bloodlink\\" criterion. £4,000 was offered to anyone who applied for the scheme and was rejected on the \\"bloodlink\\" grounds. Complaints were received by the Office that the Ministry of Defence had rejected claims under this scheme as well. In one instance, an anonymous claimant who had been born in British Malaya and interned in Singapore was told that a previous apology and payment had been given to them in error. Abraham issued a report in September 2011, Defending the Indefensible, which condemned the actions of the Ministry of Defence as \\"extraordinarily insensitive\\", \\"disgraceful and unfair\\" and \\"unforgivable\\". She added that it was \\"the worst example I have seen in nearly nine years... of a government department getting things wrong and then repeatedly failing to put things right or learn from its mistakes\\". The Government admitted the failings of the Ministry of Defence and paid additional compensation to those who had suffered distress. In conclusion, the Minister for Veterans, Andrew Robathan, stated: \\"I hope an injustice has now been fairly rectified.\\" =Other reports= Abraham published other notable reports while serving as Ombudsman. In October 2005, she issued Redress in the Round alongside the Local Government Ombudsman, concluding a lengthy saga between the complainants, Mr and Mrs Balchin, Norfolk County Council and the Department of Transport concerning blight caused by a proposed bypass. After four reports and three judicial review cases, the matter was settled with the Council and the Department paying the complainants £200,000. She also reported twice on the system of tax credits operated by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). In June 2005, she issued Tax credits: Putting Things Right, in which continuing problems with how the system was operated. It was observed that the system \\"appears unable to provide an immediate, responsive and appropriate service, particularly when things go wrong\\". A number of recommendations were made, but in October 2007, she reported on the subject again. In Tax credits: Getting it wrong, she observed that despite improvements by HMRC in its administration of tax credits, big improvements were still necessary. Complaints continued to be made about the design of the system, the failures in complaint handling and the unfair or unreasonable recovery of overpayments. Abraham observed the effects of this maladministration: \\"in such instances, the impact on those concerned, typically those on the very lowest incomes who are the most vulnerable in society, is huge and highly distressing\\". In February 2011, a report was published into NHS care for the elderly. In Care and compassion? she highlighted how ten elderly patients suffered pain, indignity and distress while being cared for by the NHS. There were failures in pain control, discharge arrangements, communication with patients and their relatives and ensuring adequate nutrition. Abraham commented that the \\"harrowing accounts should cause every member of NHS staff who reads this report to pause and ask themselves if any of their patients could suffer in the same way\\". She warned that \\"the NHS must close the gap between the promise of care and compassion outlined in its Constitution and the injustice that many older people experience\\".

The lands of Huntershill were formerly part of the lands of Auchinairn owned by James Lyle; \\"his circumstances having become embarrassed his Lands of Auchinairn were sold by his Creditors by Public Roup in several lots\\" on the 15th day of October 1748. From the 1780s it was the family home of the political reformer Thomas Muir, Younger of Huntershill (1765–1799). Auchinairn is now closely entwined with Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Huntershill house is currently owned by East Dunbartonshire Council, and is a category B listed building, unfortunately during their ownership the building has fallen into disrepair and has ended up being listed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.  History  =Tenants= Huntershill house was built by a Glasgow merchant named James Martin. It was situated beside the old post road from Glasgow to Stirling (Crowhill Road) which, however, ceased to be a main road during the 1790s when the Inchbelly Turnpike trustees built a new road on the present Kirkintilloch Road alignment. In August 1781 the house was advertised for sale along with other property belonging to Martin, who had recently died. The following year it was purchased by James Muir, father of Thomas, and became the family home for some time afterwards. James Muir advertised the house for sale in December 1798, when it was said to consist of \\"a Kitchen, nine Fire-rooms, besides Garret-rooms, Closets, and two sunk Cellars\\". James Muir died in 1801 and the house was sold by his Trustees to the Gallaway family. The house passed through the hands of many different occupiers but remained in the ownership of the Gallaway family from 1803 until 1953, when it was sold by the Gallaway Trustees to Mrs. Olive McGilvray with the following burdens: > “(Fifth) In order to ensure the preservation of the existing buildings of > Huntershill House and the policy ground thereof as an ancient monument in > the national interest, the structure of Huntershill House will not be > altered nor will the policy ground be altered or built upon but the policy > ground shall remain open and unbuilt upon unless the consent of the National > Trust for Scotland be first obtained in writing to any proposed alteration > of the said Huntershill House or to any alteration or erection on said > policy ground and no building or erection shall be placed on and no > operation of any kind be carried on upon any part of the ground hereby > disponed which lies outwith said policy which would affect the amenity of > Huntershill House and policy ground as an ancient monument” =Council Ownership= In 1969 the newly formed Bishopbriggs Town Council decided to purchase it to serve as a pavilion for the adjacent recreation ground, then subject to the new development plans. The conversion would involve a total re-modelling of the interior of the house, which had not changed much since Muir’s time, and the construction of a two-storey extension. The Council was allowed to carry out these drastic alterations since the house was not listed at the time even although it was sold with the burdens in place: \\"ALL and WHOLE that area of ground containing one acre and ninety six decimal or one thousandth parts of an acre of ground, part of three acres and six decimal or one-tenth parts of an acre of ground or thereby Imperial Standard Measure, bounded on west-southwest, west and west-northwest by Crowhill Road, in the Parish of Cadder, more particularly described in a Disposition by us the said James William McGilvray and the said Mrs. Olive Millicent Cant or McGilvray in favour of James Gray Provan dated Eighth April and recorded in the said Division of the General Register of Sasines on Fourteenth May both in the year Nineteen hundred and sixty four; together with the subjects Huntershill House erected thereon, the parts, privileges and pertinents thereof and the whole right, title and interest of me and my said consenter present and future therein; But always. with and under in so far as still subsisting and applicable and not implemented, departed from or discharged the burdens, reservations, servitudes, conditions, declarations and others specified or contained in the said Disposition by Norman Macleod and Others as Trustees therein-mentioned and Others in favour of the said Mrs. Olive Millicent Cant or McGilvray\\" The conversion was accomplished during 1969-70 and was formally handed over by the contractor on 13 November of the latter year. On 15 May 1975 a small museum of Thomas Muir memorabilia was opened in a room on the upper floor of the house. The museum is now housed in Bishopbriggs Library and includes a magnificent bust of Muir by Scottish artist and sculptor Alexander Stoddart.  Present  A large section of the grounds of Huntershill House are now used as an athletics track and there are three football pitches. Local youth football clubs Rossvale BC and Rossvale Thistle use the pitches and facilities as their home venue. The garden and grounds immediately around the house however are currently overgrown and badly neglected.

History The Domesday Book records the site as belonging to \\"Gunni The Dane\\", however the structure that occupies the site was built sometime between 1615 and 1620 by John Poulett, 1st Baron Poulett. The castle was designed as a hunting lodge for Lord Poulett, a Somerset MP. The English Civil War saw the decline of Poulett's fortunes, and by 1791 the castle was derelict and being used as a dairy by a local farmer. Walton Castle in 1788 drawn by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm In the early 19th century, the manor of Walton in Gordano, including Walton Castle was bought by Philip John Miles who also held properties and extensive estates elsewhere including Kings Weston House, Leigh Court, Cardigan Priory and Underdown in Ledbury, Herefordshire, whence his family had originally come. The castle passed through the Miles family by descent and in 1975, the castle's owner, Sir William Miles, the 6th Baronet, offered to give the ruin to the public if some money could be found to preserve it. The estimate for this rose from £6,000 to £46,000 and the plan fell through, as did a plan to set up a trust. Restoration In 1979, Sir William Miles's daughter and his son-in-law, Martin Sessions-Hodge, spent £100,000 and over a year restoring the ruin into a five-bedroom, three- bathroom house. In 1984 they sold it to Rai and Margarita Hamilton, a financier and record studio owner respectively. The couple made further alterations to the castle, though some of these had to be reinstated due to problems with unauthorised removal of crenellations on a listed building. Margarita regularly hosted charity events at the castle into the late 1990s, but in 1996 the couple separated. After the council formally warned Margarita over the number of noise abatement complaints, in 2013 she sold her share of the castle for £1.5M to Walton Properties Ltd., a Guernsey company in which her estranged husband has a minority interest. In 2009 comedian Bill Bailey was guest of honour at an event designed to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Cecil Hunt was educated at Southgate County School, now known as Southgate School, then at King's College, London, where he studied journalism.Hunt, Cecil (1935). Author-biography. London: Hutchinson. He started work in the insurance business but wrote articles for newspapers until he was offered a job by the publishing company of Ernest Benn Limited to edit periodicals such as The Chemical Age and The Fruit Grocer. In 1928 Benn published Hunt’s first collection of ‘Howlers’ to great success and he followed these up with several other collections in the late 1930s for the publisher Methuen. For example: 'An epistle is the wife of an apostle';Hunt, Cecil and Blampied (1937). Hand-Picked Howlers. London: Methuen 'Two crotchets make a quaker';Hunt, Cecil and Blampied (1938). More Hand-Picked Howlers. London: Methuen. 'Lourdes is a cricket ground in London';Hunt, Cecil and Blampied (1937). Ripe Howlers. London: Methuen. and 'Parsimony is money left by your father.Hunt, Cecil (1949) The Best Howlers. London: Ernest Benn In 1930 Hunt joined the staff of The Daily Mail newspaper for whom he was soon appointed Fiction Editor.Hunt, Cecil (1948). Ink in my veins. London: Robert Hale. During the 1930s he wrote several novels under his own name and two using the pseudonyms Robert Payne and John Devon. The reason for using two pseudonyms for the same two novels is unclear, but may have occurred because of a clash with another writer also named Robert Payne. Hunt also wrote guides to journalism, publishing and writing stories; books on the origins of words and ceremonies; collections of unintentionally funny letters, epitaphs, last words, jokes, amusing notices and signs; and collections of questions for use in quizzes on topics such as music, books and sport. Hunt was latterly editor of children’s fiction for Raphael Tuck until poor eyesight forced him to retire. Cecil Hunt collaborated with two notable artists. First, with Edmund Blampied, who illustrated three collections of children’s howlers and an anthology of proverbs. He also collaborated with W. Heath Robinson on three illustrated books published during the Second World War, all illustrated with Robinson’s typically complicated and fanciful contraptions. Cecil Hunt was Chairman then President of the London Writer Circle and was instrumental in establishing Swanwick writers' summer school becoming its first Chairman in 1949 Cecil Hunt married Kathleen Dykes (b 1904, d 2011) in 1926, and they had two sons, Peter (b 1927, d 2009) and David (b 1930, d 1998).

He studied medicine at Edinburgh Medical School, qualifying as a physician and surgeon in 1892. He practised in London, Long Ditton, Dublin, Athenry. In 1901, upon the enacting of the Light Locomotives Bill he placed an order for a car, thereby laying claim to be the first ever Irish motorist and the owner of the largest and most powerful car in the country in 1901: a four- cylinder 25 h.p. Daimler of the kind most favored by royalty. After 1922 he lived in Marlowe on Thames, where he became known as an eccentric, and indulged in alcohol to the extent that it shortened his life.

She has been selected as one of the 21 \\"Leaders in Animal Behavior\\".Drickamer L. Dewsbury S. (Dec 2009) Leaders in Animal Behaviour: The Second Generation. Cambridge University Press. She is engaged in long term research projects at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute at the Escuela de Biologia, Universidad de Costa Rica. Early life and education West-Eberhard's mother was a primary school teacher, and her father, a small-town businessman, and as parents they encouraged her curiosity. She went to school in Plymouth Community Schools, Plymouth, Michigan. She recalls of her high school that the best scientific training \\"was an English course on critical reading and writing, taught by the school librarian. Biology class was just a workbook, an enormous disappointment for me.\\" She did all her degrees at the University of Michigan. She did her bachelors from University of Michigan in zoology in 1963. She earned her masters from the same place in zoology in 1964, and then her PhD(zoology) in 1967. There she was taught by Richard D. Alexander and had part-time employment in its Museum of Zoology. She records that \\"I also learned the excitement of being a sleuth in the university libraries where even an undergraduate could explore an idea beyond textbooks and could feel like a pioneer\\". She also corresponded with Edward Wilson on trophic eggs in insects, and spent summers at Woods Hole and Cali in Colombia. She did postdoctoral work (1967–1969) at Harvard University with Howard Evans. There she met her husband. She then spent the next ten years (1969–1979) as an associate in biology at the University of Valle. In 1973 she began an association with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Costa Rica which became a full-time employment in 1986. Social insects West-Eberhard has studied many species of social wasps such as Polistes fuscatus, Polistes canadensis, and Polistes erythrocephalus. Through her studies she has investigated why wasps evolved from being casteless and nestsharing casteless to becoming highly specialized eusocial species using comparative studies of tropical wasps (Hymenoptera). She has argued that origins of nonreproductive females in social wasps involves mutualism rather than only kin selection or parental manipulation. Her work upon social insects has played an important role in the development of her ideas upon phenotypic plasticity.West-Eberhard MJ. (1975). The evolution of social behavior by kin selection. Quart. Rev. Biol. 50(1):1-33.West-Eberhard MJ. (1987). Flexible strategy and social evolution. , pp. 35-51 In Animal societies: Theories and facts, Y. Ito, J. L. Brown, and J. Kikkawa, eds., Japan Scientific Societies Press, Ltd., Tokyo. As she notes \\"From there I got interested in alternative phenotypes—alternative pathways and decision points during development, and their significance for evolution, especially for higher levels of organization, for speciation, and for macroevolutionary change without speciation.\\" Phenotypic plasticity West-Eberhard has written from the mid-1980s upon the role of \\"alternative phenotypes,\\" such as polymorphisms, polyphenisms, and context sensitive phenotype life history and physiological traits. This resulted in her 2003 book Developmental Plasticity and Evolution. She argues that such alternative phenotypes are important since they can lead to novel traits, and then to genetic divergence and so speciation. Through alternative phenotypes environmental induction can take the lead in genetic evolution. Her book Developmental Plasticity and Evolution developed in detail how such environmental plasticity plays a key role in understanding the genetic theory of evolution. Her argument is full of examples from butterflies to elephants. Sexual and social selection West-Eberhard was among the first scientists to reexamine Charles Darwin's ideas in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex about sexual selection and identify the key importance he gave to the \\"social competition for mates\\" as a factor in evolutionWest-Eberhard MJ. (1979). Sexual selection, social competition, and evolution. Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. 51(4):222-234. and speciation.West-Eberhard MJ. (1983). Sexual selection, social competition, and speciation. Quart. Rev. Biol. 58(2):155-183. She has noted how sexual selection can trap animals into sexual dimorphisms, to maintain separate sexes in sexual reproduction.

It is a framework for the actualization of the Federal Government's economic growth agenda during 2011–2015. The Agenda is anchored on the pillars and targets of the NV 20:2020 and it aims to i) create decent jobs in sufficient quantity to resolve the protracted problem of unemployment and reduce poverty, ii) lay foundation for robust and inclusive growth within the Nigerian economy, and iii) improve, on a sustainable basis, the well-being of all classes of Nigerians regardless of their circumstances and location. The four areas of focus of the Transformation Agenda are governance, human capital development, infrastructure and real sector. =First National Implementation Plan= The First National Implementation Plan (1st NIP), with the theme \\"Accelerating Development, Competitiveness and Wealth Creation\\", is a medium term plan for the actualization of the long term broad objectives and targets of the NV 20:2020. The 1st NIP is the period 2010-2013 and it aims to bridge the infrastructural gap in the country, optimize the sources of economic growth to increase productivity and competitiveness, develop a knowledge-based economy to deepen the technology base of the country, improve governance, security law and order, and foster accelerated, sustainable social and economic development in a competitive business environment.

The total investment profile for 1st NIP is N32 trillion, with the Federal Government investing N10 trillion, and the States and Local Governments investing N9 trillion. The private sector will invest the remaining N13 trillion. A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E;) framework has been established to track progress in the implementation of the 1st NIP to ensure high performance and accountability. The M&E; framework also includes a Performance Contract between the President and the Ministers/Heads of agencies, which is cascaded down the Ministries and Agencies.

NEEDS builds on the earlier two-year effort to produce the interim PRSP (I-PRSP), and the wide consultative and participatory processes associated with it. NEEDS is not just a plan on paper, it is a plan on the ground and founded on a clear vision, sound values, and enduring principles. It is a medium term strategy (2003– 07) but which derives from the country's long-term goals of poverty reduction, wealth creation, employment generation and value re-orientation. NEEDS is a nationally coordinated framework of action in close collaboration with the State and Local governments (with their State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy, SEEDS) and other stakeholders to consolidate on the achievements of the last four years (1999–2003) and build a solid foundation for the attainment of Nigeria's long-term vision of becoming the largest and strongest African economy and a key player in the world economy.Review of Planning Documents =SEEDS= On the State level, State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategies (SEEDS) are being developed to complement NEEDS.

Since states receive over 52% of federal resources, NPC – in collaboration with the donors-decided to develop a system whereby state performance can be monitored using SEEDS and to identify priority areas and states that demonstrate effective use of allocated resources. The SEEDS process was launched in early 2004 and a SEEDS Manual designed by the National Planning Commission (NPC) setting out the required contents and process for an effective SEEDS was disseminated to all state via a national dissemination process involving representatives of government, civil society and the private sector at state level. Subsequently, technical assistance was offered to all state to support the development of their SEEDS by teams of consultants with relevant expertise.

It was built in 1797 by Muhammed Hasan Khan. The palace was intended to house the Khans who were in charge of controlling Sheki, as viceroys of the ruling Zand and later Qajar Persian dynasties somewhere between 1750 up until the time were these territories were annexed by the Russian Empire per treaty of Gulistan in 1813 after the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813). The Palace of Shaki Khans was nominated for List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO in 1998 by Gulnara Mehmandarova — president of Azerbaijan Committee of ICOMOS—International Council on Monuments and Sites. On 7 July 2019, the Historic Centre of Sheki with the Khan’s Palace was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Preservation and restoration From 1955 to 1965 restoration was carried out in full under the supervision of Niyazi Rzaev. Two talented architects, Kamal Mamedbekov and Nikolai Utsyn, were involved in this work creating measurement and restoration drawings. The restoration workshop was established in the ceremonial hall on the second floor of the palace, and the rooms flanking the hall were used to accommodate the architects. The drawings developed by Mamedbekov and Utsyn formed the basis of the restoration project for the entire palace complex. Execution of the restoration work based on the drawings was entrusted to the artist F. Hajiyev and the shabaka master A. Rasulov. The last total and complete restoration from 2002 - 2004 supported by the World Bank and executed under leading of a German restoration team (Uwe Henschel, Dietrich Wellmer, Elisabeth Wellmer, Andreas Lessmeister) from company \\"Denkmalpflege Mecklenburg GmbH\\" (today \\"Neumühler Bauhütte GmbH\\"). History In 1946 Konstantinov wrote in his article \\"Nuha\\": \\"This Magnificent Palace — the top of luxury and taste of Persian architects, was built in 1790 by Shiraz resident Haji Zeynal Abdin\\". Poet Nikolai Tikhonov, who visited the palace in 1947, described the Palace in his autobiographical story \\"the Roads-the trails\\". \\"The paintings of the Khan's Palace and various patterns are well preserved, and they assure us that art was developed in ancient Nukha, and poetry and philosophy was highly appreciated.\\" In 1968, the historical part of Yukhari-Bash, located at Palace of Shaki Khans, was declared a historical-architectural reserve. The Palace of Shaki Khans was nominated for List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO in 2001 by Gulnara Mehmandarova — president of Azerbaijan Committee of ICOMOS—International Council on Monuments and Sites. Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova visited the Palace of Shaki Khans within the framework of official visit to Sheki on August 1, 2010. On July 4, 2012, the 250th anniversary of the palace was celebrated in Sheki. Ambassadors of nearly 30 countries and international organizations, including figures of science, culture and art of country, as well as members of the National Assembly took part in the ceremony. Only two- story palace building survived till present time built in Shaki fortress and consisting of several buildings. Although the building has repeatedly been repaired and reconstructed since it was built, all this work didn’t have a serious impact on its appearance. After the Shaki Khanate joined to the Russian Empire, the palace was subordinated to the local administration and repaired repeatedly. Restoration was carried out in the palace by Hussein Khan Mushtag's grandson, poet Karim agha Fateh during 1848-1851. “Restoration of khans palace” was discussed in Avercom plenum on April 25, 1991 and following decision was made: “Restoration of khans palace is under the responsibility of Narkomprosom according to the previous decision of Azverkom. 25 million rubles have been allocated from the budget of Narkomprosom for the repair of khan's palaces in Shusha and Shaki.” Restoration report was submitted based on the restoration project review by architect Pyotr Baranovsky in a meeting of the Commonwealth Academy of Architecture held on 13 March 1939. Restoration work was carried out in 1950s. Art critic Valentina Antonova writes about restoration artist I.Baranov’s works that, “whimsical and cheerful fighting scenes were described on wall paintings of khan’s palace belonging to XVIII century in Nukha which reminded noisy eastern markets”. Restoration work was carried out with the project and leading of architect Niyazi Rzayev during 1955-1965. During these years artist F.Hajiyev and ornamentalist A.Rasulov worked in the palace. Restoration work started in the palace within the framework of the project on \\"Cultural heritage protection\\" in 2002. Along with its pool and plane trees, the summer residence is the only remaining structure from the larger palatial complex inside the Sheki Khans' Fortress, which once included a winter palace, residences for the Khan's family and servants' quarters. It features decorative tiles, fountains and several stained-glass windows. The exterior was decorated with dark blue, turquoise and ochre tiles in geometric patterns and the murals were coloured with tempera and were inspired by the works of Nizami Ganjavi.David C. King. Azerbaijan, Marshall Cavendish, 2006, p. 99 Measuring thirty-two meters by eight and a half meters on the exterior, the summer residence is a two-story masonry structure elongated on the north-south axis and covered with a wooden hipped roof with long eaves. The layout of both floors is identical; three rectangular rooms are placed in a row, separated by narrow, south-facing iwans that provide access to the rooms. The floors are accessed separately to accommodate their public and private functions. Entered from the south through the two iwans, the ground floor was used primarily by clerks and petitioners. Two stairways attached to the northern façade gave access to the first floor, which was reserved for the khan's family and their guests. The summer residence is renowned for the lavish decoration of its exterior and interior. Large portions of the residence's facade, including the entire southern elevations of the central halls on both floors, are covered by a mosaic of colored glass set in a wooden latticework (shebeke) that was assembled without nails or glue. Muqarnas hoods crowning the four iwans are highlighted with gold on the lower level and covered with mirror fragments on the first floor. Remaining surfaces on all façades are decorated with floral tile panels and tile mosaics. The interior walls of the residence are covered entirely with frescoes painted at different times during the eighteenth century. Many of the frescoes feature flowers in vases, while a series of paintings on the first floor halls depict hunting and battle scenes. Signatures on frescoes list the names of artists Ali Kuli, Kurban Kuli and Mirza Jafar from Shemaha, Usta Gambar from Shusha, and Abbas Kuli, who may also have been the architect of the summer residence.  Research  For the first time, the Shaki Khan Palace was studied by the Department of Azerbaijan Monument Protection. Later, the Institute of History named after Bakikhanov of SSR Academy of Sciences has thoroughly investigated the monument in more detail. In the following period, the Department of Architectural Works under the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR was involved in the study of monuments in Azerbaijan. Early research work in the Palace was carried out with the participation of Professor Fridolin and Sharifov. In 1936, a special expert staff including Denike, Chepeleva, Weimar, and Bolotova from the Moscow State Museum of Eastern Cultures collected a lot of information about the monument.

It is also referred to as an XML bomb or as an exponential entity expansion attack.  Details  The example attack consists of defining 10 entities, each defined as consisting of 10 of the previous entity, with the document consisting of a single instance of the largest entity, which expands to one billion copies of the first entity. In the most frequently cited example, the first entity is the string \\"lol\\", hence the name \\"billion laughs\\". At the time this vulnerability was first reported, the computer memory used by a billion instances of the string \\"lol\\" would likely exceed that available to the process parsing the XML. While the original form of the attack was aimed specifically at XML parsers, the term may be applicable to similar subjects as well. The problem was first reported as early as 2002, but began to be widely addressed in 2008. Defenses against this kind of attack include capping the memory allocated in an individual parser if loss of the document is acceptable, or treating entities symbolically and expanding them lazily only when (and to the extent) their content is to be used.  Code example  ]> &lol9; When an XML parser loads this document, it sees that it includes one root element, \\"lolz\\", that contains the text \\"&lol9;\\". However, \\"&lol9;\\" is a defined entity that expands to a string containing ten \\"&lol8;\\" strings. Each \\"&lol8;\\" string is a defined entity that expands to ten \\"&lol7;\\" strings, and so on. After all the entity expansions have been processed, this small (< 1 KB) block of XML will actually contain 109 = a billion \\"lol\\"s, taking up almost 3 gigabytes of memory. Variations The billion laughs attack described above takes an exponential amount of space. The quadratic blowup variation causes quadratic growth in storage requirements by simply repeating a large entity over and over again, to avoid countermeasures that detect heavily nested entities.https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.html#xml- vulnerabilities (See computational complexity theory for comparisons of different growth classes.)

Early life Heard was born in Nice, France on March 9, 1957 to his French mother and U. S. Navy officer father. \\"I grew up in France, England, Morocco, Washington, DC, and Dallas, all before I started school. I speak French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and a little German,\\" he said. Returning to Nice for his education, he graduated from the lycée (high school) in 1977; \\"I got passionately interested in wargames when I was attending the Lycée ... primarily in Avalon Hill games like Kriegspiel, Luftwaffe, Third Reich, and Panzer Leader—the classics. There were, of course, no French editions of these games at the time, so we all had to learn the American versions.\\" Heard loved to travel, so he studied hotel management and worked as a concierge in both France and San Francisco. Career While living in San Francisco Heard discovered the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, and when he returned to Paris he joined his first regular Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) group. \\"I started writing articles on D&D; and AD&D; for a French gaming magazine, and there learned that TSR was looking for a translator to translate the games into French. Well, I spoke and wrote both languages, and I knew the games, so I wrote a letter to Gary Gygax. By a coincidence, he was just about to come to Paris on business, and so we set up a meeting. I must have done OK, because he offered me the job.\\" TSR hired Heard in 1983.Q&A; at BlogSpot After a few months of doing translation work in Nice, TSR moved the translating job to the home office in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, so Heard moved to the United States. After working for two years as a translator (which also included coordinating outside translators who turned the games into German, Italian, and Spanish), Heard transferred to TSR's Games Division in July 1985 as an Acquisitions Editor, working with Jon Pickens. When Pickens was promoted to Editor of Strategy & Tactics, Heard became Games Acquisitions Coordinator, in charge of contracting freelance writers. Heard also did some game design, including adventure modules CM7, Tree of Life; M1, Into the Maelstrom; and co-authorship of DL12, Dragons of Faith. In 2013, Heard decided to self-produce The World of Calidar, a completely new setting with no reference to a specific ruleset, but with some flavor similar to Mystara and the Princess Ark.

Life and career Son of Harman Warner of London, merchant tailor, he was baptised at St. Clement Danes in the Strand on 17 September 1581. He became demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1599, and was elected fellow there in 1604. He proceeded M.A. in 1605, and D.D. in 1616. He was rector of St. Michael's, Crooked Lane, London, from 1614 to 1619, and was nominated prebendary and canon of Canterbury in 1616. He was instituted rector of Bishopsbourne, Kent, in 1619, rector of Hollingbourne, Kent, in 1624, and rector of St. Dionis Backchurch, London, in 1625. Warner was a strong supporter of the monarchy. In 1626, he preached in Passion week before the king at Whitehall a sermon on Matthew xxi. 38: 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him,' which nearly occasioned his impeachment by parliament, and induced him to obtain for safety the king's pardon. In 1633 he became chaplain to Charles I and dean of Lichfield. In the same year he attended the king at his coronation in Edinburgh. In 1637, he was promoted to the bishopric of Rochester. In March 1640, he preached a sermon in Rochester Cathedral on Psalm liiiv. 23, 'Forget not the voice of thy enemies,' against the puritans and rebels, to which allusion made in 'Scot Scout's Discovery.' Warner attended at York in 1640 the king's council of peers, at which only one other prelate was present. He took part in the convocation which was called together on the opening of the Short parliament of 1640. When that parliament was dissolved, and the convocation continued its sittings under royal licence, Warner assisted William Laud in framing new canons. Warner joined in the declaration made on 14 May 1641 by the bishops to maintain the existing constitution of church and state. On 4 August following he was impeached with other bishops by the House of Commons, under the stature of praemunire, for taking part in the convocation of 1640 and making new canons. In December 1641 Warner, with eleven other bishops, was committed to prison, but the impeachment was afterwards dropped, meeting the defence made by Warner through Chaloner Chute, the counsel whom he had selected for the defence of the bishops. On 13 February 1642, when the bishops were excluded by statute from the House of Lords. Sequestration of his lands and goods followed in 1643, and Warner had to leave Bromley Palace in disguise. For three years he led a wandering life in the west of England. By Charles's command he published in 1646 a treatise on Church Lands not to be sold, or a Necessary and Plain Answer to the question of a Conscientious Protestant whether the lands of Bishops and Churches in England and Wales may be sold. On 4 February 1649, within a week of the execution of Charles I, he preached and afterwards published anonymously a sermon alludint to it on Luke xviii. 31: 'Behold we go up to Jerusalem, entitled The Devilish Conspiracy.The devilish conspiracy, hellish treason, heathenish condemnation, and damnable murder, committed, and executed by the Iewes, against the anointed of the Lord, Christ their King And the just judgment of God severely executed upon those traytors and murderers. As it was delivered in a sermon on the 4 Feb. 1648. being the quinquages. Sunday, out of some part of the Gospel appointed by the Church of England to be read on that day. In 1649, on payment of a fine, the sequestrations on his property were discharged; but he refused to take the oaths to the usurping government, as he considered it to be. At the Restoration Warner and eight other sequestrated bishops who had survived resumed, the government of their dioceses. In 1661 parliament recalled the bishops to the House of Lords, and once more, on 11 February 1662, Warner was able to address his clergy in Rochester Cathedral. He died on 14 October 1666, aged 86, and was buried in Merton's Chapel in Rochester Cathedral, where a monument by Joshua Marshall exists to his memory. Legacy Warner was married, but he died without issue, and on his death his estates descended to his nephew John Lee, archdeacon of Rochester, who was the son of his sister, and who afterwards assumed the additional name of Warner in compliance with the terms of the bishop's will. Warner had inherited wealth, and endowed Bromley College (or Bishop Warner's College at Bromley), a home for 20 widows of clergyman, to be supported by his estate at Swaton,http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45479 among numerous gifts and benefactions. Money he left for Scottish scholarships at Magdalen College, was refused, and Balliol College took it, urged by Thomas Good.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63873 Gilbert Burnet had a copy of the Articles of the Barons, the heads of agreement for the Magna Carta, and he said it had come via John Lee from Warner, who had taken it from Lambeth Palace at the time of Laud's arrest on 18 December 1640. Hugh Trevor- Roper finds this episode, in which Warner took papers of Laud's for safe- keeping or to avoid embarrassment, to be confused in its details when Burnet's account is compared with Laud's. But he doesn't rule out Burnet's version. Stephen Langton took the Articles in 1215, and they were in the Lambeth archives.http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile;=show.php%3Ftitle=338&chapter;=48741&layout;=html&Itemid;=27Hugh Trevor-Roper, Archbishop Laud, 1573-1645 (2000 edition), pp. 419-20.J.

In 1645 he published The Gayne of Losse, or Temporal Losses spiritually improved, in a Century and one Decad of Meditations and Resolves. The authorship of an anonymous manuscript diary giving eyewitness details of the House of Lords during the start of the Long parliament is attributed to him, for example by Conrad Russell.

The Ferhadija mosque reflects the full maturity of the classical Ottoman style- domed mosque, portico with small domes, and beautiful built-on minaret. Research works on the painted decoration inside the mosque carried out in the 1964/1965 revealed five painted layers dating from various periods. The oldest and extremely valuable decorations of the first layer date from the 16th century (in the dome, on the cornice and pendentives, the base of the corner calottes, the mihrab and the lunettes of the lower row of windows), belonging to the group known as Rumi ornament, which were also to be seen in the Aladža mosque in Foča. The next layers (on the calottes, central part of the mihrab, and surface of the dome) consists of purely floral decorations with the features of 18th-century style.

While living here he also co-edited the periodical Norsk Skoletidende, founded in Hamar by Nils Hertzberg (editor from 1869 to 1873), stepping down in 1918. He was a board member of Hamar public library from 1887 to 1936. Hobbies included horticulture and beekeeping, as well as song and music--he was an organist in Nes church for many years and later a sexton in Hamar. From 1907 to 1914 he served as the \\"national song inspector\\" in Norway. In Norsk biografisk leksikon he was called \\"a personality of unusual strength and many-sidedness\\". Sandvik held the HM The King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) from 1899. He died in December 1936 in Hamar. In February 1955 a bust was raised of him.

The rating can include more than one treatment response. The accessor is normally an independent observer other than the patient, but the accessor can also be the patient (a patient-reported outcome). Furthermore, some clinical outcomes can only be assessed by the patient (a \\"private phenomena\\"). Because the evaluation is subjective, this can result in both inter-rater or intra-rater reliability. When conducting clinical trials, ensuring rating consistency is important, but can prove to be quite difficult to obtain. Studies dealing with such indications as pain, mental disease or mood are not able to easily track progress with physical or physiological testing, rather, verbal subjective human testing is used. This can allow for an array of differences in rating. Blinded assessors who are not told which treatment group a patient belongs to have a significantly lower observer bias compared to non-blinded assessors. Rater training is sometimes used in an attempt to lower rater variability.

It was published on 4 May 2009 by Walker Books. It is the second book in the Chaos Walking series, preceded by The Knife of Never Letting Go and followed by Monsters of Men. The story follows Todd Hewitt, a 13-year-old boy held captive by the mayor of New Prentisstown. Plot summary Resuming directly after The Knife of Never Letting Go, Todd Hewitt is captured by the Mayor's army in Haven, renamed New Prentisstown, but his only concern is for Viola. He is forced to live in the town's clock tower with the previous Mayor, Con Ledger. Ledger explains that Haven discovered a cure for Noise, but Mayor Prentiss (now President Prentiss) has confiscated it for sole use by leaders of New Prentisstown. He has also separated the males and females, and imprisons all domestic Spacks who live in the town. The Mayor organises a speech as the rest of his army marches in. He expresses his displeasure at the easiness of taking over, claiming that the people will pay for the lack of war. Elsewhere, Viola awakens. Likewise her thoughts are for Todd. She is in a house of healing, a 'clinic' staffed by female healers, as opposed to male doctors, for her gunshot wound. She meets Mistress Coyle, the head of the facility, who also has previous political and activist ties. Viola also meets the apprentices Corinne Wyatt and Maddy as she recovers. Todd is made to work with the enslaved Spackle of New Prentisstown with Davy Prentiss. Todd hopes that by complying he is ensuring Viola’s health and safety, while the Mayor hopes that Davy will become a better person with Todd's influence. Todd is disgusted at the treatment of the Spackle, yet Davy is proud of his authority. As the Spackle speak via Noise, cure has been placed into the Spackle's food to prevent communication. Back at the house of healing, Viola finally recovers enough to help Mistress Coyle and begins an apprenticeship as a healer. However, one night Mistress Coyle and many other healers disappear. They have led a group of women out of New Prentisstown to form a resistance movement, reconvened from the time of the Spackle War, known as \\"The Answer\\", to carry out a series of bombings in the city. Davy and Todd receive orders to brand the Spackle with numbered metal bands. Though Todd is shocked by this unethical practice, he wants to ensure Viola's safety. During the branding, Davy strangles a Spackle around the neck with a band, killing it, to the disgust of Todd. However, Todd continues the task without argument. One of several large bombings occur both in town and the Spackle reserve. Todd, trying to redeem himself, saves a Spackle banded with the number 1017, who is ungrateful. Mayor Prentiss sets up a counter-intelligence unit called \\"The Ask\\". He promotes Todd and Davy into this unit, where New Prentisstown residents are captured and tortured for information on The Answer. The next morning, Viola finds that the House of Healing is almost completely empty. The rest have gone to join the Answer. Mistress Coyle returns to recruit Viola, who feels forced to join, knowing about Mayor Prentiss' tortures. Todd realizes that he must take sides. At The Answer’s headquarters outside of town, Viola learns about the bombings and participates in an attack. An older teenager, Lee, befriends her. He is intent on avenging his family, who have been taken by The Ask. A large bombing occurs outside of town, and Todd finds that all the Spackle have been killed in a mass genocide - the only Spackle to survive is 1017, who angrily attacks Todd and leaves. 1017 reveals he can freely use his Noise; he has been starving himself to prevent taking the cure. Horrified at the genocide, the perpetrator still unknown, the Mayor teaches Todd to chant 'I am the Circle and the Circle is me' to calm his Noise. Todd is surprised to find that he and Davy now share a friendship. Davy returns Todd's stolen mother's diary. Meanwhile, Viola learns of a planned bombing that in New Prentisstown that could harm Todd. Viola and Lee arrive at the tower to rescue him. Viola notices that there is something darker to his personality, but still urges Todd to leave with them, warning that the attack will come from the east. Suddenly Ledger appears, armed, revealing his secret loyalty to Prentiss. While threatening them he finds a self-arming bomb in Viola's bag. Too late, Ledger attempts to throw it away, but it explodes, killing him and injuring Todd, Viola and Lee. Mayor Prentiss captures the three. Viola is interrogated and tortured, with Todd watching from a soundproof room. Mayor Prentiss want to know where The Answer will attack from, drowning Viola, who refuses to answer. Unable to watch, Todd screams that the Answer is attacking from the east. The Mayor thanks Todd, and leaves to organise his army. Todd realizes where his duty lies and formulates a plan to stop the Mayor with the help of Ivan and other personnel. Ivan and the guards agree to help Todd rescue Lee and Viola. Lee hurries back to the Answer, while the others go to stop the Mayor. At the cathedral, the Mayor disables the entire group with his Noise and captures Viola. The Mayor still wants Todd to join him despite his betrayal; he reveals that he has never taken the cure, instead training his Noise via the 'I am the circle and the circle is me' chant to silence, which also allows him to attack and control others with his mind. Davy arrives to tell his father that the Answer army is coming, and requires orders. Suddenly, a second scout ship, like the one Viola crashed in, flies in near New Prentisstown. In desperation, Todd holds Davy at gunpoint, threatening to kill him if the Mayor does not release Viola. Shockingly, the Mayor drops Viola and fires his gun, quickly killing Davy. Davy reveals that he had shot Ben, Todd's guardian. He begs for forgiveness but dies before Todd can answer. In anger, and quick to learn, Todd uses his own Noise as a weapon with Viola’s name to overcome the Mayor. He ties him up in the cathedral while Viola goes to meet with the scout ship. Suddenly, a horn sounds to warn of an army of Spackle marching towards the city, seeking revenge for the genocide. With no alternative, Todd releases Mayor Prentiss to enlist help; hoping that he is not making the biggest mistake of his life. Released from his bonds, the Mayor claims that what has come to New World is what men are born for: war. Reception The Ask and the Answer received largely positive reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly praised the brilliant cast, and believed it to be \\"among the best YA science fiction novels of the year\\", including it in their best books of 2009, while Anita Barnes Lowen from Children's Literature labelled the book \\"a stunning not-to-be-missed science fiction adventure.\\" Independent on Sunday said that \\"... it is every bit as ambitious as the first book but the ambition is easily matched by the execution, with powerful prose and tight plotting that pull the reader on at a terrifying speed.\\" The Sunday Times commented that \\"Ness is both accessible and sophisticated,\\" and said that he handled extraordinary themes \\"in prose that is simple and heart-stopping.\\" Daily Mail also praised the themes in The Ask and the Answer, calling the plot \\"twisting\\" and \\"action-packed.\\" A starred review from Booklist did the same, calling it a \\"relentless flurry of heavy- hitting issues, hinging on appeasement, complicity, and maintaining one’s morality in the face of impossible choices.\\" Kirkus Reviews noted that the plot was \\"breathless... with heartbreakingly real characters\\" and the Costa Book Awards 2009 judges recognised the novel as \\"a strikingly original and compelling work.\\" =Awards= * 2009 Costa Children's Book Awardhttp://bookblips.dailyradar.com/story/the-ask-and-the-answer-by-patrick- ness-wins-the-costa/ ;Runners up * 2009 Teenage Book of the Year Award shortlist * 2009 Booktrust Teenage Prize longlist * UKLA Children's Book Award longlist  References  Category:2009 British novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:British young adult novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:Children's science fiction novels Category:2009 science fiction novels Category:Novels set on fictional planets Category:Novels by Patrick Ness ","title":"The Ask and the Answer"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your bitcoin🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const E=d(B,[["render",R]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/23.md","filePath":"quotes/23.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/23.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{x as __pageData,L as default};
