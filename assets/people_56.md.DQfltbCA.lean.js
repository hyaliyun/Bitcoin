He was a student of Nicolas Toussaint Charlet, and was a retrospective painter of the Empire. Biography Raffet was born in Paris. At an early age he was apprenticed to a wood turner, but took up the study of art at evening classes. At the age of 18 he entered the workshop of Cabanel, where he applied his skill to the decoration of china, and where he met Rudor, from whom he received instruction in lithography, in the practice of which he was to rise to fame. He then entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, but returned to lithography in 1830 when he produced on stone his famous designs of L√ºtzen, Waterloo, Le bal, La revue, and Les adieux de la garrison, by which his reputation became immediately established.

Raffet's chief works were his lithographs of the Napoleonic campaigns, from Egypt to Waterloo, vigorous designs inspired by ardent patriotic enthusiasm. In this endeavour he was a contemporary of other French artist-lithographers of Napoleon and the French army including Hippolyte Bellang√©, Horace Vernet, and Nicolas Toussaint Charlet. As an illustrator his activity was prodigious, the list of works illustrated by his crayon amounting to about forty-five, among which are B√©ranger's poems, the History of the Revolution by Adolphe Thiers, the History of Napoleon by de Norvins, the great Walter Scott by Auguste Defauconpret, the French Plutarch and Fr√©d√©ric B√©rat's Songs. He went to Rome in 1849, was present at the siege of Rome, which he made the subject of some lithographs, and followed the Italian campaign of 1859, of which he left a record in his Episodes de la campagne d'Italie de 1859. His portraits in pencil and water-colour are full of character. He died at Genoa in 1860. In 1893 a monument by Emmanuel Fr√©miet was unveiled in the Jardin de l'Infante at the Louvre, Paris. The statue was removed and melted down during the nazi occupation of Paris.

He was regarded as one of the leading lyric tenors of the 20th century. Schreier was a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor conducted by Rudolf Mauersberger, performing as an alto soloist. He became a tenor, focused on concert and lieder singing, well known internationally for the Evangelist parts in Bach's Christmas Oratorio and Passion. A member of the Berlin State Opera from 1963, he appeared in Mozart roles such as Belmonte in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail and Tamino in Die Zauberfl√∂te, and in the title role of Pfitzner's Palestrina, among others. He appeared at the Vienna State Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, among others, as one of few singers from the German Democratic Republic to perform internationally. Schreier made many recordings, especially of Bach's works as both a singer and a conductor, even simultaneously. He recorded many lieder including the song cycles by Schubert and Schumann. He was known for intelligent understanding of texts and their musical expression with intensity. Schreier received awards including the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, L√©onie Sonning Music Prize.  Early life  Schreier was born in Meissen, Saxony, and grew up in the village of , near Meissen, where his father was a teacher, cantor and organist. In June 1945, when Schreier was almost ten years old, and just a few months after the destruction of Dresden, he entered the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor boys' choir. Its conductor Rudolf Mauersberger recognized his talent. He let him sing many solo alto parts and created compositions with his voice in mind. Solo recordings from the time (1948‚Äì1951) were reissued on compact disc. Schreier was 16 years old when his voice broke, and he became a tenor, as he had passionately wished, because of the several Evangelists - all tenors - in J.S. Bach's Passions and in his Christmas Oratorio. After he had decided to become a professional singer he took voice lessons, privately from 1954 to 1956, then at the Musikhochschule Dresden, where he also studied conducting.  Career  Peter Schreier made his professional debut at the Dresdner Staatsoper in 1957, as the First Prisoner in Beethoven's Fidelio. His breakthrough came in 1962 as Belmonte in Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, and he also appeared as Tamino in The Magic Flute. In 1963, he became a member of the Berlin State Opera. Starting in 1966, he was for many years an annual guest of the Vienna State Opera. That same year he made his debut in Bayreuth Festival as the young seaman in Tristan und Isolde with Karl B√∂hm as conductor. For 25 years, beginning in 1967, he took part in the program of the annual Salzburg Festival. In 1969, he starred as The Witch in Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, in a CD recording that featured the Staatskapelle Dresden. He performed more than 60 operatic roles. It was important to him to sing the title role of Palestrina, the opera by Hans Pfitzner, not only in Munich but also in East Berlin -- a controversial issue at the time in East Germany. Schreier was one of few singers from the German Democratic Republic to perform internationally, including at the Metropolitan Opera. He appeared regularly at the Vienna State Opera, where he sang 200 performances, beginning as Tamino in 1967, also as Belmonte, Don Ottavio in Mozart's Don Giovanni, the title role of Idomeneo, Flamand in Capriccio by Richard Strauss, Lenski in Tchaikovsky's Eugen Onegin, Count Almaviva in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia and Loge in Wagner's Das Rheingold. His Wagner roles also included Mime in Siegfried. He recorded Bach cantatas regularly with the Thomanerchor and the Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Erhard Mauersberger, with soloists including Adele Stolte, Annelies Burmeister and Theo Adam, such as the cantata for Pentecost Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172, in 1970. He was the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion in recordings conducted by both Rudolf and Erhard Mauersberger, Karl Richter, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan. He recorded Bach's St John Passion and Christmas Oratorio with Helmuth Rilling. In June 2000, Schreier left the opera stage. His last role at the Berlin State Opera was Tamino; he argued that he could no longer pretend to be a young prince. He ended his singing career on 22 December 2005, combining the functions of Evangelist and conductor in a performance of Bach's Christmas Oratorio in Prague. He kept singing lieder, a genre he had pursued throughout his career, including the song cycles by Schubert and Schumann. From the early 1970s, Schreier was also a conductor with a special interest in the works of Mozart, Bach, and Haydn. He conducted orchestra such as the Vienna Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic.  Personal life  Schreier was married and lived in Dresden from 1945, in the district of Loschwitz. He died in Dresden on Christmas Day, 25 December 2019, after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Renate, and two sons, Torsten and Ralf.  Evaluation  Schreier was an extremely intelligent singer, with sympathetic feeling for the text. Monika Gr√ºtters, Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, summarised after his death that he was one of the most impressive voices from Germany (\\"eine der eindrucksvollsten Stimmen unseres Landes\\", who represented Germany in the opera houses of the world as a nation of culture (\\"f√ºr die Kulturnation Deutschland gestanden\\"), remembered as Evangelist in Bach's Passions, and having written music history in a career of four decades.

Sometimes his last name is given as Kovalsky or Koval'sky or Koval'skiy. In the scientific literature, his name was given as Kowalski or Kowalsky. Marian Albertovich Kowalski. He was born in Dobrzy≈Ñ nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ (called –î–æ–±–∂–∏–Ω—å in Russian) in Congress Poland, Russian Empire. His patronymic is alternatively given as Voytekhovich or Voytsekhovich (–í–æ–π—Ç–µ—Ö–æ–≤–∏—á or –í–æ–π—Ü–µ—Ö–æ–≤–∏—á), which suggests his father's name was Wojciech. Confusingly, a few Russian sources even give his name as Marian Albertovich Kovalsky-Voytekhovich, but this seems to be an error. He graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1845. His PhD was in 1852 for his theory of the orbit of Neptune. Beginning in 1852 he was director of the Kazan Observatory, and dean of faculty of physics and mathematics in Kazan. His most important work was on the analysis of the proper motion of 3,136 stars from James Bradley's catalog, which was the first usable method to deduce the rotation of the Milky Way galaxy. Based on this work, he disproved that a single massive central body in the center of our galaxy was responsible for the motion of the stars. In celestial mechanics, he found improved methods to deduce a planetary orbit from observations, and analysed the mathematics of perturbations in planetary motions. In particular, he made a more accurate determination of Neptune's orbit. He also found an improved method of determining the orbits of binary stars. His important papers were published in 1859 in the book Recherches astronomiques de l'observatoire de Kasan. He died in Kazan and is buried in the Catholic cemetery there . He was the father of Aleksandr Marianovich Kowalski, who worked at Pulkovo Observatory and who died on July 6, 1902 at the age of 44. The crater Koval'skiy on the Moon and the crater Koval'sky on Mars are both named in his honour.

In modern Japan, however, the term is most often used in reference to independent volumes of a single manga, as opposed to manga magazines, which feature multiple series. Typically, the chapters of a manga are initially serialized before being collected into individual volumes. Major publishing imprints for include Jump Comics (for manga serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump and other Jump magazines), Shogakukan's Sh≈çnen Sunday Comics, and Kodansha's Sh≈çnen Magazine Comics. Japanese comics This Japanese edition of Love Hina volume 11 is smaller than this English edition of Genshiken volume 8. Increasingly after 1959, manga came to be published in thick, phone-book-sized weekly or monthly anthology manga magazines (such as Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine or Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump). These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors. They are printed on very cheap newsprint and are considered disposable. Since the 1930s though, comic strips had been compiled into collecting multiple installments from a single series and reprints them in a roughly paperback- sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing.Jason Yadao. The Rough Guide to Manga. Strips in manga magazines and tankobon are typically printed in black and white, but sometimes certain sections may be printed in color, or using colored inks or paper. In English, while a translation is usually marketed as a \\"graphic novel\\" or \\"trade paperback\\", the transliterated terms and are sometimes used amongst online communities. Japanese people frequently refer to manga by the English loanword , although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word \\"manga\\", as they are the same thing. The term also refers to the format itself‚Äîa comic collection in a trade paperback sized (roughly ) book (as opposed to the larger format used by traditional American graphic novels). Although Japanese manga tankobon may be in various sizes, the most common are Japanese B6 () and ISO A5 (). The format has made inroads in the American comics market, with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format, which is sometimes also called \\"digest format\\" or \\"digest size\\". In the United States, many manga are released in the so-called \\"Tokyopop trim\\" or \\"Tokyopop size\\" (approximately ). Special formats =Aiz≈çban= An is a collector's edition volume. These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition, special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, and so on. are generally printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and collectability of those few copies made. The format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as Fruits Basket, Rurouni Kenshin and Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin being reissued in format. Generally only the most popular manga are released in this format. =Bunkoban= A edition refers to a printed in bunko format, or a typical Japanese novel-sized volume. are generally A6 size () and thicker than and, in the case of manga, usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release. In the case of manga, a tends to contain considerably more pages than a and usually is a republication of of the same title which may or may not have been out of print. Thus, the edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes. For example, Please Save My Earth was published in 21 volumes, and then re-released in 12 volumes. If the original manga was a wide-ban release, the release will generally have the same number of volumes. The term is commonly abbreviated in Japanese to just (without the -). =Kanzenban= The is another term sometimes used to denote a type of special release. A release is generally A5 size () and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers, color pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, features that are often omitted or converted to grayscale in standard releases. While the appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes, the term emphasizes their completeness, though it is likewise generally reserved for popular manga such as Dragon Ball. =Shins≈çban= Similar to a wide-ban, a is a new edition released with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new color pages and other extras. For example, in 2002, Sailor Moon was reedited; some pages were completely redrawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. Plus, the chapters were redivided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18. =S≈çsh≈´hen= The is a relatively new format published by Shueisha beginning in 2008. A edition is B5 size (), larger than a , and similarly reproduces chapter covers and color pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews. The majority of releases are for popular manga with ongoing serializations. They also contain far more pages than a standard and thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes; Naruto Part I was originally published in 27 volumes, but was completed in just eight volumes. =Wide-ban= A wide- ban or edition is larger (A5 size) than a regular . Many manga, particularly and manga, are published in wide-ban editions after magazine serialization, and are never released in the format that is common in manga and manga. When a series originally published in format is re-released in wide-ban format, each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition, and therefore the series will consist of fewer volumes. For example, Maison Ikkoku was originally released in 15 volumes, but was republished as 10 wide-ban volumes.

But it was not until 1823, while working for the goldsmith Emile Fauconnier that he discovered his true predilection from watching the animals in the Jardin des Plantes, making vigorous studies of them in pencil drawings comparable to those of Delacroix, then modeling them in sculpture on a large or small scale. In 1819 while he was studying at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Barye sculpted a medallion named Milo of Crotana Devoured by a Lion, in which the lion bites into Milo's left thigh. Milo's theme was the school's official theme for the medallion competition of 1819, where Barye earned an honorable mention. c. 1820 Barye sculpted Hercules with the Erymanthean Boar, depicting Hercules's fourth Labor, where he had to capture a live wild boar from Mount Erymanthos. National Museum, Warsaw) Barye was no less successful in sculpture on a small scale, and excelled in representing animals in their most familiar attitudes. Barye sculpted the portrait medallion Young Man in a Beret (1823) in bronze, as well as Portrait of the Founder Richard (1827), in which only a head and neck are shown. He also sculpted Poised Stag (1829), a much larger sculpture, which had a height of 48 cm, and was one-third life size. Barye didn't only want to be known as a sculptor of small bronzes, he wanted to be known as a sculpteur statuaire (a sculptor of large statues). In 1831 he exhibited much larger statues, Tiger Devouring a Gavial Crocodile, which was a plaster sculpture 41 cm high and 103 cm long, and Lion Crushing a Serpent, 138 cm high and 178 cm long, made in bronze. In 1832 had truly mastered a style of his own in the Lion with a Snake. Theseus and the Minotaur, 1843 (Baltimore Museum of Art) Roger and Angelica Mounted on the Hippogriff, 1846 (Walters Art Museum) Lapith Combating a Centaur, 1848 Turkish Horse, No. 2, modeled c. 1844 (Walters Art Museum) Tomb and bust of Antoine-Louis Barye at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Jaguar Devouring a Hare, 1850 (Walters Art Museum) Barye, though engaged in a perpetual struggle with want, exhibited year after year studies of animals, admirable groups which reveal him as inspired by a spirit of true romance and a feeling for the beauty of the antique, as in his Theseus and the Minotaur (1843),http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/192857 Roger and Angelica on the Hippogriff (1846)), Lapitha and Centaur (1848), Jaguar Devouring a Hare (1850), and numerous minor works now very highly valued. The latter two works were exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1850, causing Th√©ophile Gautier to observe:\\"The mere reproduction of nature does not constitute art; Barye aggrandizes his animal subjects, simplifying them, idealizing and stylizing them in a manner that is bold, energetic, and rugged, that makes him the Michelangelo of the menagerie.\\" Examples of his larger work include the Lion of the Column of July, of which the plaster model was cast in 1839, various lions and tigers in the gardens of the Tuileries, and the four groups War, Peace, Strength, and Order (1854). While Barye excelled at sculpture, he often faced financial burdens due to his lack of business knowledge. In 1848 he was forced to declare bankruptcy, and all of his work and molds were sold to a foundry. The foundry began making inferior work from 1848 to 1857, and his reputation suffered during this time.Mackay, James, The Animaliers, E.P. Dutton, Inc., New York, 1973 In 1876 what remained of Barye's inventory, 125 models, were sold to the Ferdinand Barbedienne foundry. The 1877 Barbedienne catalogue offered all of the models in bronze in variable sizes, and the Barbedienne castings were of superb quality. Fame did not come until later in life. In 1854 he was made Professor of Drawings at the Museum of Natural History, and was elected to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts in 1868. He produced no new works after 1869. The mass of admirable work left by Barye entitles him to be regarded as one of the great animal life artists of the French animalier school, and the refiner of a class of art which has attracted such men as Emmanuel Fr√©miet, Paul-√âdouard Delabri√®rre, Auguste Cain, and Georges Gardet. There is a public square on the eastern tip of √éle Saint-Louis in Paris dedicated to him. Family Barye had a son, Alfred Barye, who studied under him and also became an animalier sculptor. Alfred, although very competent in his own right as a sculptor, would struggle to gain notoriety working in the shadow of his more famous father. Antoine-Louis was not pleased when his son began signing work as \\"A. Barye\\" because he thought this created confusion between his work and that of his son. He forced his son to sign as \\"A. Barye, fils\\" or \\"Alf Barye\\" in order to distinguish their works. The senior Barye signed only one way throughout his entire career, simply marking his bronzes \\"Barye\\".

Timken operates from 33 countries.  Company history In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for an improved tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis. In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland. In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.The Timken Company: Information and Much More from Answers.com Timken entered international markets in the early 1900s, establishing a presence initially in Great Britain, France and Germany. The performance of Timken tapered roller bearings in World War I military equipment made an impression on the European bearing market.Pruitt, Bettye H. and Jeffrey R. Yost. Timken: From Missouri to Mars ‚Äì A Century of Leadership in Manufacturing. Harvard Business School Press, 1998, p. 112. After the war, Great Britain rose to the position of #2 in the global automotive manufacturing market, creating opportunities for Timken to expand its European manufacturing presence.Pruitt, Bettye H. and Jeffrey R. Yost. Timken: From Missouri to Mars ‚Äì A Century of Leadership in Manufacturing. Harvard Business School Press, 1998, p. 115-116. Timken entered the Great Depression in a strong financial position and its performance placed it in the ranks of the most solid, well-managed industrial firms of the 1930s.Pruitt, Bettye H. and Jeffrey R. Yost. Timken: From Missouri to Mars ‚Äì A Century of Leadership in Manufacturing. Harvard Business School Press, 1998, p. 117. Expanding into non-automotive markets like agriculture, machine tooling, industrial and rail softened the impact. During World War II, Timken production increased dramatically to keep up with wartime demand. For instance, every U.S. jeep was built using 24 Timken¬Æ bearings. With 660,000 jeeps delivered to the U.S. military, Timken delivered more than 15.8 million bearings for those vehicles over the course of the war.Pruitt, Bettye H. and Jeffrey R. Yost. Timken: From Missouri to Mars ‚Äì A Century of Leadership in Manufacturing. Harvard Business School Press, 1998, p. 148. Following the war, much of the machinery shipped to Europe under the Marshall Plan was Timken- bearing equipped, helping Timken establish a broader presence in a bearing market where European competitors had dominated.Pruitt, Bettye H. and Jeffrey R. Yost. Timken: From Missouri to Mars ‚Äì A Century of Leadership in Manufacturing. Harvard Business School Press, 1998, p. 157.

By the late 1990s Timken also had a sales presence in Spain, Hong Kong, China and Singapore. The company changed its corporate structure in 2014; the roller bearing-producing part of the company was separated from the steel-producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies. The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel. In February 2020, Timken Company acquired Diamond Chain, a roller chain manufacturer headquartered in Indianapolis. The company plans on moving the operation to Fulton between 2022 and 2023.

The original Sargon first appeared in All-American Comics #26, (May 1941), and was created by John B. Wentworth and Howard Purcell. The character continued in All-American Comics until issue #50 (June 1943), and then moved to Comic Cavalcade (1943-1946) and Sensation Comics (1946-1948). The modern Sargon first appears in Helmet of Fate: Sargon #1 (April 2007) and was created by Steve Niles and Scott Hampton. The name Sargon is of Mesopotamian origin, and one king of Akkad and two of Assyria bore this name. Sargon appeared in live-action in the Arrowverse crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths, portrayed by Ra√∫l Herrera. Fictional character biography =John Sargent= Sargon debuted in All- American Comics #26, with a publication date of May 1941. He was a stage magician, dressed like a swami complete with turban, to disguise the fact that he wielded true mystical powers, passing off such feats as illusions. As a child, he came into possession of the mystic Ruby of Life which allowed him to control anything he touches (touching the ground lets him erect a wall, for instance). Taking his professional name from the ancient king of the same name, Sargon has had a checkered career, acting mostly as a hero during the Golden Age aided by his cartoonish fat little comic relief sidekick / manager Maximillian O'Leary as he battled crooks, spies and his azure-skinned archenemy the Blue Lama, the Queen of Black Magic. He re-emerges in the Silver Age ‚Äì as a villain, at least at first. It was later explained that his villainous activities were the result of certain side effects of possessing the Ruby of Life. He was brought back for occasional guest appearances in the Silver Age and was awarded with an honorary membership in the Justice League in Justice League of America #99 in 1972. Sargon later explained that he moved from his home of Earth-Two to take up residence on Earth-One in 1950.Justice League of America #220 (Nov. 1983) The original Sargon the Sorcerer by artist Howard Purcell Sargon maintained contacts with several other mages in the DC Universe, notably Baron Winters, Zatara (a fellow faux stage magician), and the younger mage John Constantine. Sargon answered the summons of Constantine to participate in a ritual at the mansion of Winters to help deal with the effects of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, using the Swamp Thing as their portal into the war being fought in Hell. Locking hands in a circle of power, and using the psychic powers of Constantine's drunken acquaintance Mento, the group of sorcerers (which also included Zatara's daughter Zatanna) observed the events unfolding, and attempted in turn to channel their magical powers into several other mystical characters present in Hell, including Etrigan, the original Doctor Fate, and the Spectre. Their enemy, a primal form of evil (called the Great Evil Beast) that was surging upwards to obliterate everything in its path, sensed their interference and lashed out several times; its power raced around the circle, finding a weak link and incinerating it. The first to fall was Sargon. At first panicking and crying out for the others to help him, and almost pulling his hands away from the circle, Sargon was rebuked by Zatara to maintain his composure and die like a sorcerer. In a final act of will, Sargon apologized for his outburst, calmly sat in place and was burned alive without a whimper, never letting go of his colleagues' hands the entire time. This ritual also kills Zatara and drives Mento completely insane.Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #49-50 (June-July 1986) Sargon would later return in Swamp Thing, \\"borrowing\\" the body of an elderly German man named Koestler and planning to lead the souls trapped in Hell in an assault on Heaven. He sacrificed this form to save his niece, Gracie Brody. During the Books of Magic series, the Phantom Stranger and young Timothy Hunter had a brief encounter with what was apparently Sargon's soul, who attempted to warn the boy of the dangers and costs of pursuing magical power. He then disintegrated right before their eyes, leaving behind his Ruby of Life. Sargon appears in the Day of Judgement series as a gray soul in the realm of Purgatory. He presumably joins in the fight against the guardians of Purgatory when a team of living heroes arrives to bring back the soul of Hal Jordan. =David John Sargent= The Helmet of Fate miniseries featured a Sargon the Sorcerer one- shot, starring his successor David John Sargent. After dropping out of college, having at least seven relationships, and a brief stint as the lead singer in a band, David spent the rest of his life as a drifter on the side of the road. One day two men who claimed to represent the estate of his grandfather, the original Sargon, found David and told him that he was his heir. Actually, these men were demons trying to find Sargon's Ruby of Life, but could not do so because of the protection spells he had placed on his house. David was tricked into signing away his grandfather's estate over to the two men, who then prepared to force him to find the Ruby when the Helmet of Fate suddenly appeared. David escaped the two and was led into his grandfather's secret attic by Sargon's ghost. Searching around, he found his grandfather's old props, his suit and turban, which contained some pieces of the Ruby. Those pieces then went into David's chest; through them Sargon was able to project himself in front of his grandson. He explained to David that he needed a successor to his name to find the remaining pieces of the Ruby, which had somehow shattered, and he was the only member of his bloodline still alive. He also explained that he pulled the Helmet off its course in order to provide a distraction long enough to grant David the Ruby's power. David accepted the role of Sargon the Sorcerer, and armed with new mystical abilities, went to drive the two men from his home. At the time, the two used a piece of the Ruby they acquired to turn themselves into demons, and managed to weaken the Helmet. David then quickly disposed of the two, and sent the Helmet back on its course after placing a piece of himself into it. David went on to play a part in Reign in Hell, assisting Zatanna and Blue Devil, and ultimately sacrificing himself to Lobo's mercy to allow many heroes and anti- heroes out of Hell; this event left Zatanna and Blue Devil traumatized, as they were the ones who went to Sargon for help in the first place.DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell #1 (August 2008) and Reign In Hell #1‚Äì8 (September 2008 ‚Äì April 2009) =The New 52= In 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC universe in \\"The New 52.\\" Sargon appears briefly in Justice League Dark, where he is mentioned as one of the great magicians of the past age, among peers such as Zatara and Dr. Occult. In Constantine #1, Sargon is revealed to have been one of four powerful magicians who became corrupted by their power and formed the villainous cult known as the Cold Flame. He is shown to have died some time prior, and his daughter has taken on his powers and role in the group, under the name Sargon the Sorceress. In other media Sargon the Sorcerer was mentioned on the DC Super Hero Girls short \\"Vanity Insanity\\". Jessica Cruz implied to Zatanna that meeting him was the most important day of her life. Sargon the Sorcerer makes a cameo appearance in the fifth part of the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event, portrayed by Ra√∫l Herrera. He attempted to rob a bank while using an illusion of a giant Beebo toy as a diversion. When Supergirl, Batwoman, Flash, Sara Lance, Atom, and Heat Wave fought it, they discovered it was not real. Sara and Flash later tracked down Sargon and knocked him out, causing his illusion to disappear. References External links * Sargon the Sorcerer at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Its current territory encompasses all of central and southern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and the Eastern Shore. It is a suffragan diocese of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Baltimore, from which its territory was taken, and is a constituent of the ecclesiastical province of Baltimore. As of 2018, there were 241,276 Catholics and 142 parishes that are part of the Diocese of Richmond. The diocese currently has 91 active priests, 41 retired priests, 140 permanent deacons, 7 religious brothers, 181 religious sisters of Catholic religious orders and 31 seminarians serving 139 parishes. There are 28 diocesan Catholic schools in the diocese, with a total enrollment of 8,827 students in 5 high schools and 22 elementary schools.\\"Diocesan Statistics\\", Diocese of Richmond The diocese's current Bishop is Barry C. Knestout, who was appointed by Pope Francis on December 5, 2017. He was installed to the position on January 12, 2018. History Catholic \\"church on wheels\\" in Richmond, 1955 Prior to the American Revolution, few Catholics lived in colonial Virginia. Attempts to found Catholic settlements in Virginia were made by Lord Baltimore in 1629, and Captain George Brent in 1687. In the spring of 1634 Father John Altham, a Jesuit companion of Father Andrew White, the Maryland missionary, laboured amongst some of the Virginia tribes on the south side of the Potomac. Stringent laws were soon enacted in Virginia against Catholics. In 1687 Fathers Edmonds and Raymond were arrested at Norfolk for exercising their priestly functions. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century the few Catholic settlers at Aquia Creek, near the Potomac, were attended by Father John Carroll and other Jesuit missionaries from Maryland. It was not until the passage of Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786 that Catholics were free to worship openly in the commonwealth. Rev. Jean Dubois, afterwards third Bishop of New York, accompanied by a few French priests and with letters of introduction from Lafayette to several prominent Virginia families, came to Norfolk in August, 1791, where he laboured a few months. Proceeding to Richmond towards the end of the year, he offered in the courtroom of the new State House, by invitation of the General Assembly, the first Mass ever said in the Capital City. James Monroe served as his host until Father Dubois rented a house in Richmond near a major bridge and opened a school to teach French, classics and arithmetic.Fogarty, Gerald, Commonwealth Catholicism: a history of the Catholic Church in Virginia (University of Notre Dame Press, 2001) pp. 25-36 Patrick Henry helped the priest learn English. For two years Dubois mostly celebrated mass in rented rooms or at the homes of the town's few Catholic families.Hayes, Patrick. \\"John Dubois.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 26 Aug. 2014 According to tradition, at an early date, probably at the time of the Declaration of Independence, Alexandria had a log chapel with an unknown resident priest. Rev. John Thayer of Boston was stationed there in 1794. Rev. Francis Neale, who in 1796 constructed at Alexandria a brick church, erected fourteen years later a more suitable church where Fathers Anthony Kohlmann, and Benedict Joseph Fenwick, afterwards second Bishop of Boston, frequently officiated. About 1796 Rev. James Bushe began the erection of a church at Norfolk. He was succeeded by were the Very Rev. Leonard Neale, afterwards Archbishop of Baltimore. The Diocese of Richmond was canonically erected by Pope Pius VII on July 11, 1820.Magri, Francis Joseph. \\"Diocese of Richmond\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 27 June 2019 The new Diocese of Wheeling was formed by splitting off the western part of this diocese in 1850, and that same year, this diocese received the small area which had been retroceded from the District of Columbia in 1846. The Civil War led to formation of the state of West Virginia, but the boundary between that state and Virginia did not coincide with the boundary of the Wheeling and Richmond dioceses. The two eastern-shore counties were transferred to the new Diocese of Wilmington in 1868, leaving Virginia split between three dioceses. In 1974, Virginia and West Virginia dioceses were realigned so that West Virginia was a diocese by itself and Virginia had the Richmond diocese and the new Arlington diocese, both in their entirety. On February 13, 2019, Barry Knestout released a list of 42 priests who had \\"credible and substantiated\\" accusations of sexual abuse made against them. The list covers allegations dating from the 1950s to the most recent substantiated allegation in 1993.Poulter, Amy. \\"Richmond Catholic diocese publishes list of 42 priests with 'credible' abuse allegations\\", Daily Press, February 14, 2019 Among those listed was future Bishop of Memphis, Carroll Dozier was accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the Diocese of Richmond.https://www.kait8.com/2019/02/19/former-memphis- bishop-accused-sexual-abuse/ The Diocese of Richmond has seen an increase in the number of seminarians preparing for the priesthood. According to Rev. Michael Boehling, the typical candidate is in his early to mid-20s, and college graduate with a degree in history, science or mathematics. \\"They are articulate and bright, well-rounded individuals who are mature for their age,\\"Sheler, Jeff. \\"Catholic Diocese of Richmond rebounds from past\\", The Virginian-Pilot, October 20, 2013 In early 2019 Knestout gave permission to the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia to ordain Susan B. Haynes as the new bishop at Saint Bede Catholic Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. The Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia does not have a cathedral and usually rotates where it hosts ordinations and other events. However the announcement was met with opposition by many Catholics who objected to holding a non- Catholic worship service and women's bishop ordination in a Catholic church. Over 3,000 people signed an internet petition objecting to the event. On 17 January the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia announced it would no longer hold Haynes' ordination at St. Bede. In 2019, Knestout instructed Fr. Mark White to shut down his blog, under pain of removal from the priesthood. White had criticized the church hierarchy's handling of the child sexual abuse crisis, including Theodore McCarrick, for whom Knestout had served as priest secretary, and Donald Wuerl, with whom he had worked as auxiliary bishop. In May 2020 Knestout removed White from his parish and trespassed him from the parish residence. Knestout ordered White to take up residence at a retreat center, and undertake a ministry to prisoners. On June 2, the Holy See denied White's appeal on technical grounds. On October 15, 2020, it was revealed that the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond had paid $6.3 million to settle 51 out of 68 claims of sex abuse.

J. Grandville, was a French caricaturist. Life and work He was born at Nancy, in northeastern France, to an artistic and theatrical family. The name \\"Grandville\\" was his grandparents' professional stage name. Grandville received his first instruction in drawing from his father, a painter of miniatures. At the age of twenty-one he moved to Paris, and soon afterwards published a collection of lithographs entitled Les Tribulations de la petite propriet√©. He followed this with Les Plaisirs de tout √¢ge and La Sibylle des salons (1827); but the work which first established his fame was Les M√©tamorphoses du jour (1828‚Äì29), a series of seventy scenes in which individuals with the bodies of men and faces of animals are made to play a human comedy. These drawings are remarkable for the extraordinary skill with which human characteristics are represented in animal facial features. Grandville's \\"metamorphoses\\" were highly influential to fantastic illustration Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e et publique des animauxvol.1 and vol.2 of original edition used as tarot card The success of this work led to his being engaged as artistic contributor to various periodicals, such as La Silhouette, L'Artiste, La Caricature, Le Charivari; and his political caricatures which were characterized by marvelous fertility of satirical humour, soon came to enjoy a general popularity. After the reinstitution of prior censorship of caricature in 1835, Grandville turned almost exclusively to book illustration, supplying illustrations for various standard works, such as the songs of B√©ranger, the fables of La Fontaine, Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe. He also continued to issue various lithographic collections, among which may be mentioned La Vie priv√©e et publique des animaux, Les Cent Proverbes, Un Autre Monde and Les Fleurs anim√©es. Though the designs of Grandville are occasionally unnatural and absurd, they usually display keen analysis of character and marvellous inventive ingenuity, and his humour is always tempered and refined by delicacy of sentiment and a vein of sober thoughtfulness. He died on 17 March 1847 and is buried in the Cimeti√®re Nord of Saint-Mand√© just outside Paris. A short notice of Grandville appears in Th√©ophile Gautier's Portraits contemporains. See also Charles Blanc, Grandville (Paris, 1855).  Legacy  Grandville's ability for political provocation made his work much in demand. He worked in a wide variety of formats, from his first job illustrating the parlor game Old Maid, to illustrated newspaper strips of which he was a master. His illustrations for Le Diable √† Paris (\\"The Devil In Paris\\"; 1844‚Äì46) were used by Walter Benjamin for his study of that city as an urban organism. One of Grandville's supreme achievements, at a time when French printing technology was ascendant, was Les Fleurs Anim√©es, a series of images that are both poetic and satirical. But perhaps his most original contribution to the illustrated book form was Un Autre Monde, which approaches the status of pure surrealism, despite being conceived in a pre-Freudian age. Leading members of the Surrealist movement such as Andr√© Breton and Georges Bataille recognised in Grandville a significant precursor and inspiration for the movement. Juggler of Universes from Un Autre Monde British rock band Queen used part of his artwork for their 1991 album Innuendo and alternate pieces for most of the subsequent single releases: the album's title track, \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\". The single \\"Headlong\\" also featured one of Grandville's characters on the back of the sleeve and as the basis for a picture disc release. His style and humour had a marked influence on John Tenniel and various other Punch-cartoonists. American grunge band Alice in Chains used part of Grandville's artwork for their self-titled 1995 album. The graphic novel Grandville by Bryan Talbot was greatly inspired by Grandville's illustrations. Grandville's art is used extensively in the video game Aviary Attorney, which is set during a fictionalized version of the French Revolution of 1848.

Summary Unlike communities, where problems arise and are solved by those within the group, parties are formed when individuals seek out support beyond their immediate spatial environment. Status groups such as communities, or groups of individuals in similar class situations, become parties only when their means of mobilizing and assembling in pursuit of power becomes structured. A teachers' union is one example of a party drawn from a collective communal body. While the party may not represent the will of each individual member, it forms on the basis of rational collective interests and the assignment of outside individuals to protect those interests.Weber, Max (1967). \\"Class, Status, Party\\". From Max Weber, 180‚Äì195. For instance, when taxpayers in a geographic region mobilize to vote against support for allocation of resources to local schools, the teachers' union may enter the political realm to protect the interests of its members. These pursuits are thought to be rational in that they only represent the demands of the members insofar as they relate to the reason for that party's congregation. While all members of the same union may support protection of local wildlife, those interests would be pursued via a separate party. Unlike power formed on the basis of wealth or status, parties tend to most successfully aggregate and mobilize when their members represent a range of environments and social statuses. While a party's objective may ultimately be the protection of financial capital or the status of its members, parties initially form to represent a range of group interests. A party's political program represents both the key issues that party members decide on once congregated, and pull issues aimed at attracting members who share detached but similar interests.Weber, Max (1967).\\"Politics as a Vocation\\". From Max Weber, 77‚Äì128. For instance, the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity may use political leverage to obtain funding from the local government, but the homebuilding it provides in low-income neighborhoods draws grassroots support for the organization's efforts. While parties always seek to maintain political leverage, the local environment provides the human capital with which to mobilize those demands. According to Weber, parties can form in unintended directions and pursue ends that are not initially part of their intended purpose. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber argued that the Protestant religion, initially formed as a spiritual institution, became the ethic that underlay the transition into capitalism. The initial pro-capitalist political parties that formed in Europe reflected the desire to prove success in spiritual life via the accumulation of capital, which became the pinnacle of ‚Äúworldly calling‚Äù. As he argued of rationality in general, parties become the formally sanctioned, bureaucratic extension of emotional authority as society transitions into modernity.Weber, Max (2003). The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Parties form primarily in democratic societies because of the ideological differences that can arise between individuals in the same geographic region. Issues with party power As more contemporary theorists have noted, parties tend to become overburdened with demands as they grow larger and lose focus on initial key issues. One example, pursued by Doug McAdam in his writing Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, was the Civil Rights Movement. Although the movement initially succeeded and made enormous social and political impact due to its rational and centered goals, the movement began to weaken throughout the 1970s due in part to irreconcilable views touted by its various leaders and sects.McAdam, Doug. 2006.

The orbit of a Mars-crosser is displayed in the bottom row on the right. In generic terms, a Mars-crosser has a smaller perihelion and a larger aphelion compared to Mars. Special cases include inner-grazers (top row, in the middle) and outer-grazers (bottom row, in the middle), which do not completely cross the orbital band described by Mars. The other three diagrams describe a co-orbital configuration (top row, on the right) where the asteroid's orbit is contained within the orbital band of Mars, as well as a near-Earth asteroid such as an Amor asteroid (top row, on the left) and a main-belt asteroid, for example of the Hungaria family, which orbits are contained completely either inside or outside the orbit of Mars, respectively. A Mars-crossing asteroid (MCA, also Mars-crosser, MC) is an asteroid whose orbit crosses that of Mars. The known numbered Mars-crossers are listed here. They include the two numbered Mars trojans 5261 Eureka and . Many databases, for instance the JPL Small-Body Database (JPL SBDB), only list asteroids with a perihelion greater than 1.3 AU as Mars-crossers. An asteroid with a perihelion less than this is classed as a near-Earth object even though it is crossing the orbit of Mars as well as crossing (or coming near to) that of Earth. Nevertheless, these objects are listed on this page. A grazer is an object with a perihelion below the aphelion of Mars (1.67 AU) but above the Martian perihelion (1.38 AU).\\"Mars crosser\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, (2009), retrieved online May 3, 2009. The JPL SBDB lists 13,500 Mars-crossing asteroids. Only 18 MCAs are brighter than absolute magnitude (H) 12.5, which typically makes these asteroids with H<12.5 more than 13 km in diameter depending on the albedo.

Biography He was born at Nantes in the Loire-Atlantique d√©partement of France. Delaunay studied under Flandrin, and at the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris under Lamothe. He worked in the classicist manner of Ingres until, after winning the Prix de Rome, he went to Italy; in 1856, and abandoned the ideal of Raphaelesque perfection for the sincerity and severity of the quattrocentists. After his return from Rome he was entrusted with many important commissions for decorative paintings, such as the frescoes in the church of St Nicholas at Nantes; the three panels of Apollo, Orpheus and Amphion at the Paris Opera house; and twelve paintings for the great hall of the council of state in the Palais Royal. His Scenes from the Life of St Genevieve, which he designed for the Panth√©on, remained unfinished at his death. The Mus√©e d'Orsay has his famous Plague in Rome (shown at the Salon of 1869) and a nude figure of Diana; and the Nantes Museum, the Lesson on the Flute. In the last decade of his life he achieved great popularity as a portrait painter. Among his subjects were his ‚ÄúMother‚Äù and ‚ÄúMademoiselle Toulmouche.‚Äù He was awarded a first-class medal at the Paris Exposition of 1878, and the medal of honor in 1889. In 1878 he became an officer of the Legion of Honor, and the following year was made a member of the Institute. Jules-√âlie Delaunay died in Paris in 1891.

His celebrated 1836 work Jeune Homme Nu Assis au Bord de la Mer (\\"Young Male Nude Seated beside the Sea\\") is in the Louvre. Biography =Early life= From an early age, Flandrin showed interest in the arts and a career as a painter. However, his parents pressured him to become a businessman, and having very little training, he was forced to instead become a miniature painter. Jeune homme nu assis au bord de la mer (1836) Hippolyte was the second of three sons, all of whom were painters in some aspect. Augusto, his older brother, spent most of his life as a professor at Lyon and later died there. Paul, his younger brother, was a painter of portraits and religious imagery. Hippolyte and Paul spent some time at Lyon, saving to leave for Paris in 1829 and study under Louis Hersent. Eventually, they settled in the studio of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, who became not only their instructor but their friend for life. At first, Hippolyte struggled as a poor artist. However, in 1832, he won the Prix de Rome for his painting Recognition of Theseus by his Father. This prestigious art scholarship meant that he was no longer limited by his poverty. =Career= Polyt√®s, son of Priam, observing the movements of the Greeks (1833-34) The Prix de Rome allowed him to study for five years in Rome. While there, he created several paintings, increasing his celebrity both in France and Italy. His painting St. Clair Healing the Blind was created for Nantes Cathedral, and at the exhibition of 1855 years later, it also brought him a medal of the first class; this painting was destroyed in the fire which took place at Nantes Cathedral on 18 July 2020.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/19/french-police-question-man- over-nantes-cathedral-fire Jesus and the Little Children was given by the government to the town of Lisieux. Dante and Virgil visiting the Envious Men struck with Blindness and Euripides writing his Tragedies are now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon. Upon his return to Paris in 1856, Flandrin received a commission from the chapel of St John in the church of St S√©verin. As a result, his reputation became even more impressive, virtually guaranteeing him continuous employment for the rest of his life. In addition to these works, Flandrin also painted a great number of portraits, including Portrait of Napoleon III. However, he is much more known today for his monumental decorative paintings. The most notable of these are found in the following locations: * in the sanctuary, choir, and nave of St Germain des Pr√©s at Paris (1842‚Äì1861) * in the church of St Paul at N√Æmes (1848‚Äì1849) * of St Vincent de Paul at Paris (1850‚Äì1854) * in the church of St-Martin-d'Ainay at Lyon (1855) =Death= In 1853, Flandrin was elected to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. In 1863, his failing health, made worse by his hard work and extended exposure to the damp and draughts of churches, induced him to visit Italy again, where he died of smallpox in Rome on 21 March 1864.

Life and career  He was born in Paris. He became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, and obtained the Prix de Rome in 1797. In the Salon of 1802, he showed Metamorphosis of Narcissus, and he continued to exhibit with rare interruptions up to 1831. He married Louise-Marie-Jeanne Mauduit in 1821. His pupils were Louis-Eug√®ne Bertier, Auguste Bigand, H√©l√®ne Charlotte Juliette Bourge, Augustin Luc Demoussy, Henri Joseph Constant Dutilleux, Hippolyte Dominique Holfeld, Jean-Francois-Hyacinthe-Jules Laure, Eug√®ne Modeste Edmond Lepoittevin, Emile Aubert Lessore, Auguste Dominique Mennessier, Fran√ßois Alexandre Pernot, Julie Philipault, August Thomas Pierre Philippe, Pierre Poterlet, Joachim Sotta, Henry de Triqueti, and Th√©ophile Auguste Vauchelet.Louis Hersent in the RKD His most considerable works under the First French Empire were Achilles parting from Briseis, and Atala dying in the arms of Chactas (both engraved in Landon's Annales du Mus√©e); an Incident of the life of F√©nelon, painted in 1810, found a place at Malmaison, and Passage of the Bridge at Landshut, which belongs to the same date, is now at Versailles. Hersent's typical works, however, belong to the period of the Restoration; Louis XVI relieving the Afflicted (Versailles) and Daphnis and Chlo√´ (engraved by Laugier and by Gel√©e) were both in the Salon of 1817; at that of 1819 the Abdication of Gustavus Vasa brought to Hersent a medal of honour, but the picture, purchased by the Duke of Orl√©ans, was destroyed at the Palais-Royal in 1848, and the engraving by Henriquel-Dupont is now its sole record. Ruth, produced in 1822, became the property of Louis XVIII, who from the moment that Hersent rallied to the Restoration jealously patronized him, made him officer of the Legion of Honour, and pressed his claims at the Institut de France (Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts), where he replaced van Spaendonck. He continued in favour under Charles X, for whom was executed Monks of Mount St Gotthard, exhibited in 1824. In 1831, Hersent made his last appearance at the Salon with portraits of Louis Philippe, Marie Am√©lie and the duke of Montpensier; that of the king, though good, is not equal to the portrait of Spontini (Berlin), which is probably Hersent's chef-d'≈ìuvre. After this date, Hersent ceased to exhibit at the yearly salons. Although in 1846 he sent an excellent likeness of Delphine Gay and one or two other works to the rooms of the Soci√©t√© d'Artistes, he could not be tempted from his usual reserve even by the international contest of 1855.

According to the , it has a population of people. Glan is located on the west by Sarangani Bay, on the north by Davao Occidental, and on the south by the Celebes Sea. It is largely based on agriculture with a high level production of copra. Aquaculture is the second biggest income earner, notably milkfish and shrimps culture. Other agricultural products are coconuts, maize, sugarcane, bananas, pineapples, mangoes, pork, eggs, beef, and fish. The economy has accelerated in the past decade driven by advances in global communication technology and the finishing of a modern highway that tremendously improved trade and transport. The municipality is classified as he \\"heritage town\\" by cultural conservationists, including members of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts due to the many well-preserved ancestral houses and heritage structures within the municipality. The Heritage Conservation Society suggested an ordinance, similar to the ordinance in Vigan, that would protect Glan's heritage houses and aesthetics in 2014 for centuries to come. Some conservationists have also suggested for the town's inclusion in the Philippines tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site enlistment. History In the classical era, Glan used to be a vast rainforest zone, home to the B'laan and Menuvu Ubo ethnic groups. When Islam arrived in the 13th century in Maguindanao, a surge of migrants arrived, namely the Magindanawon who were part of the newly established Sultanate of Maguindanao and the T'boli people who were fleeing from the Muslims. Glan became a concoction of these four ethno-linguistic groups for centuries until the total collapse of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. When the Spaniards arrived, they established numerous ancestral houses in Glan and used the area as a base against Muslim pirates from the west and south. Much of the indigenous groups did not support the Spanish, but were forced to make labor in fear of guns and cannons used by the Spanish. Eventually, the Americans came after the American-Spanish War. The Americans imposed the entire island of Maguindanao as a single province. Glan became a strategic location in the south until World War II. After the surrender of all regular forces in the Philippines in 1942, Glan was apparently not occupied for some time by the Japanese. On May 2, 1943, 170 Japanese and supporting forces landed. These landings were fiercely contested by guerrilla forces, who, outnumbered and outgunned, retreated from the area.Kent Holmes, Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945 (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), p. 112. When the Americans left and the Philippine Republic was established, a continuous surge of Sebwano migrants from the Visayas poured in Glan, especially during the martial law era. The migration was used by the government to curb any form of secession from indigenous groups in Mindanao. The migration stopped after the People Power Revolution that restored democracy in the Philippines. Glan today is classified as a heritage town by numerous Filipino culture experts. Barangays Glan is politically subdivided into 31 barangays. Climate Demographics Heritage Town The municipality is classified by members of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as a heritage town. However, no ordinance or law has yet to be legislated for protection of Glan's heritage structures and colonial roads. A Vigan-type ordinance has been suggested by the Heritage Conservation Society, so that the town may be added to the Philippines UNESCO Tentative List in the future.

Writing funny but factual magazine articles was Cuppy's real talent. He enjoyed a brief success in 1933 with a humorous talk show on NBC radio with actress and gourmet cook Jeanne Owen, but failed to capitalize on it. His best-known work, a satire on history called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was unfinished when he died. It was completed and published in 1950 by his friend Fred Feldkamp, who sifted through nearly 15,000 of Cuppy's carefully filed note cards to get the book into print. Feldkamp also edited a second posthumous volume, a comic almanac titled How to Get from January to December, that appeared in 1951. Early life Cuppy was born in Auburn, Indiana. He was named \\"Will\\" in memory of an older brother of his father's who died of wounds he received as a Union officer at the Civil War Battle of Fort Donelson.R.E. Banta (ed.), Indiana Authors and Their Books, 1816‚Äì1916, Crawfordsville, IN: Wabash College, 1949, p. 80. Captain William H. Cuppy, 44th Regiment Indiana Infantry, was sent home to South Whitley, where he died July 15, 1862, age 26.Another relative, Cuppy's great-great uncle John Cuppy, Jr., an \\"Indian scout,\\" is reported to have encountered John \\"Johnny Appleseed\\" Chapman in eastern Ohio in 1801. Chapman reportedly warned John Cuppy and three of his companions of hostile Delaware Indians in the vicinity. Howard Means, Johnny Appleseed: The Man, the Myth, the American Story, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 137. Cuppy's father, Thomas Jefferson Cuppy (1844‚Äì1912), was at different times a grain dealer, a seller of farm implements and a lumber buyer for the Eel River branch of the Wabash Railroad. His mother, Frances Stahl Cuppy (1855‚Äì1927), was a seamstress and worked in a small shop located next to the family home in Auburn.Cuppy described his mother as \\"a singer of great talent.\\" While she sang in the choir of the Auburn Presbyterian Church, Will pumped the old-fashioned pipe organ, an experience that he said led to his membership in the \\"Guild of Former Pipe Organ Pumpers.\\" Stanley Kunitz, Howard Haycraft and Wilbur Crane Hadden (eds.), Authors Today and Yesterday, New York: H.W. Wilson Co., 1933, p. 182. The Guild of Former Pipe Organ Pumpers was a real organization. Cuppy's framed certificate of membership, dated 1929, is among his papers at the University of Chicago Library. See Guide to the Will Cuppy Papers. Young Cuppy spent summers at a farm belonging to his grandmother, Sarah Collins Cuppy (1813‚Äì1900), on the banks of the Eel River near South Whitley, Indiana. He later said that this was where he acquired his early knowledge of the natural world which he satirized in his writings.Stanley Kunitz and Howard Haycraft (eds.), Twentieth Century Authors, New York: H.W. Wilson Co., 1942, p.341. Cuppy graduated from Auburn High School in 1902 and went on to the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1907. As an undergraduate, he belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, acted in amateur theater and worked as campus reporter for several Chicago newspapers, notably the Record Herald and the Daily News. He lingered at Chicago seven more years as a graduate student in English literature. He did not show much interest in his studies, but in 1910 produced his first book, Maroon Tales, a collection of short stories about university life. In 1914 he pulled together a short master's thesis,65 pages titled The Elizabethan Conception of Prose Style. took his degree and left for New York. Literary career Indiana State Historical Marker in 2019 Cuppy supported himself in New York by writing advertising copy while he tried unsuccessfully to write a play.Burton Rascoe, Before I Forget, New York: Literary Guild, 1937, p. 178; Thomas Maeder, Afterword to The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, Boston: David R. Godine, 1984, pp. 233. Cuppy's draft registration card shows him working in 1918 for the Van Patten company, a prominent advertising firm located at 50 East 42nd Street in Manhattan. After Cuppy died, his long struggle to be a playwright was recalled by book columnist Harry Hansen who met him when they were students in Chicago: \\"About that time he told me he had begun a play, and in recent years he was still writing it.\\" He served briefly stateside in World War I as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Motor Transport Corps.Cuppy was part of the age group that did not have to register for the draft until September 12, 1918, just two months before the Armistice. See Historical Background of The World War I Draft for a description of the registration system.

Later he began contributing book reviews to the New York Tribune, where his college friend Burton Rascoe (1892‚Äì1957) was literary editor.Rascoe, p. 179. According to Rascoe, it was his assistant Isabel Paterson who \\"coaxed and coddled\\" Cuppy into writing reviews and making a success of his career as a writer.Paterson wrote Cuppy into her 1934 novel, The Golden Vanity, in the character of playwright Jake Van Buren. Stephen Cox, The Woman and the Dynamo: Isabel Paterson and the Idea of America, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2004, pp. 93‚Äì94. Cuppy dedicated books to Paterson, but they had a falling-out in the 1940s and never reconciled. Cox, p. 344. In 1926, Cuppy began writing a weekly \\"Light Reading\\" column, later renamed \\"Mystery and Adventure\\", for the Tribune's successor, the New York Herald Tribune. He continued writing the column until his death 23 years later, reviewing a career total of more than 4,000 titles of crime and detective fiction.Sandra Lieb, \\"Will Cuppy\\", in Stanley Trachtenberg (ed.), Dictionary of Literary Biography, v. 11, Part 1 (American Humorists, 1800‚Äì1950), Detroit: Gale Research Co., 1982, p. 95. Seeking refuge from city noise and hay fever (which he referred to as \\"rose cold\\"), Cuppy \\"hermited\\" from 1921 to 1929 in a shack on Jones Island, just off Long Island's South Shore. The literary result of Cuppy's seaside exile was How to be a Hermit, a humorous look at home economics that went through six printings in four months when it appeared in 1929. The book's subtitle, A Bachelor Keeps House, reflects the fact that Cuppy never married. The crew at the nearby Zachs Inlet Coast Guard Station shared their food and recipes with Cuppy and helped him repair his shack.See generally, How to be a Hermit. Encroachment by the new Jones Beach State Park forced Cuppy to abandon full- time residence on the island and return to New York's noise and soot. A special dispensation from New York's parks czar Robert Moses (1888‚Äì1981) let Cuppy keep his shack. He made regular visits to his place at the beach until the end of his life.Maeder, pp. 236‚Äì237. Moses gives an account of the Cuppy episode in Public Works: A Dangerous Trade, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970, p. 104. The Coast Guard station was abandoned by 1934. From his Greenwich Village apartment, Cuppy continued to turn out magazine articles and books. He always worked from notes jotted on 3x5-inch index cards. Cuppy would amass hundreds of cards even for a short article. His friend and literary executor Fred Feldkamp (1914‚Äì1981) reported that Cuppy sometimes read more than 25 thick books on a subject before he wrote a single word about it.Fred Feldkamp, Introduction to The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, p. 2. Writing funny but factual magazine articles was Cuppy's real talent. He enjoyed a brief success in 1933 with a humorous talk show on NBC radio with actress and gourmet cook Jeanne Owen,The program was called Just Relax. It ran 15 minutes weekly on WEAF, later WNBC (AM). Cuppy also appeared on John Towner Frederick's \\"Of Men and Books\\" radio program in 1942 to discuss mystery stories. but he flopped on the lecture circuit.Maeder, pp. 237‚Äì238; Kunitz and Haycraft, p. 342. Basically shy, Cuppy was happiest when he was rummaging through scholarly journals prizing out facts to copy out on his note cards. According to Feldkamp, one of Cuppy's favorite places was the Bronx Zoo, \\"where he felt really relaxed.\\"Feldkamp, p. 3. Many of Cuppy's articles for The New Yorker and other magazines were later collected as books: How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes (1931); and How to Become Extinct (1941). Cuppy also edited three collections of mystery stories: World's Great Mystery Stories (1943); World's Great Detective Stories (1943); and Murder Without Tears (1946). His last animal book, How to Attract the Wombat, appeared two months after his death in 1949. Cuppy's best-known work, a satire on history called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was unfinished when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, as far as the eye can see, is \\"covered by Egyptologists\\", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, in the chapter on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book's appeal can be gauged by the fact that CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air \\"until the announcer cracked up.\\"A.M. Sperber, Murrow: His Life and Times, New York: Freundlich Books, 1986, p.470. A copy of the script is on file at The Decline and Fall was completed and published in 1950 by Fred Feldkamp, who sifted through nearly 15,000 of Cuppy's carefully filed note cards to get the book into print within a year of his friend's death. Feldkamp also edited a second posthumous volume, a comic almanac titled How to Get from January to December, that appeared in 1951. Cuppy's last years were marked by poor physical health and increasing depression. Facing eviction from his apartment, he took an overdose of sleeping pills and died ten days later on September 19, 1949, at St. Vincent's Hospital. A little over four years later, on November 9, 1953, the poet Dylan Thomas died at St. Vincent's. The hospital closed in 2010. Will Cuppy's grave marker in Evergreen Cemetery in Auburn, Indiana. Cuppy's cremated remains were returned to his hometown and buried in a grave next to his mother's in Evergreen Cemetery. His grave was unmarked until 1985, when local donors purchased a granite headstone with the inscription, \\"American Humorist\\". In 2003, Cuppy received another memorial when a committee of the International Astronomical Union approved the name \\"15017 Cuppy\\" for an asteroid.Lutz D. Schmandel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names: Addendum to Fifth Edition, 2006‚Äì2008 (Springer, 2009), p. 89. In 2019, the Indiana Historical Bureau approved placing a state historic marker at Cuppy's family home in Auburn. Although Cuppy was reclusive and cultivated the image of a curmudgeon, he had many friends in New York's literary circles. One of them was the poet William Rose Ben√©t (1886‚Äì1950) who, writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, penned this remembrance of him: Cuppy documents Cuppy's papers, including thousands of his notecards, are archived at the University of Chicago Library.

The Frank Sullivan Collection at Cornell University also contains correspondence from Cuppy.

Iranian controversy A Persian translation by Najaf Daryabandari of Cuppy's The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody was published in 1972 under the title of ƒåenin konand bozorgƒÅn (⁄ÜŸÜ€åŸÜ ⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØ ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄ØÿßŸÜ, Thus Act the Great).Reviews of the Persian- language translation may be found at Goodreads.com. Darybandari's translation is also listed in WorldCat. The good quality of the Persian prose and the fact of Cuppy's being unknown in Iran led to speculation that the book was not a translation, but an original book by Daryabandari and possibly a collaborator, who was speculated to be Ahmad Shamlou. It was guessed that this had been done in order to bypass the Pahlavi era censor. Daryabandari denied it several times, even after the Iranian Revolution. The issue was not publicly settled until the satire magazine Golagha ran an article about their \\"discovery\\" of Cuppy, which proved Daryabandari right.

Dudley was born in London, England, and may have been baptised in Yardley Hastings, Northamptonshire. Dudley's parentage has never been satisfactorily established. Genealogist and researcher Marshall Kirk in 1993 published the results of his exhaustive survey of the Sutton Dudley families, and came to the conclusion that Roger was the son of Henry Sutton Dudley . Roger may also be the Roger Dudley who was matriculated as pensioner at Christ Church College, Cambridge, in 1566, but left without a degree. It is believed that Roger married, on 8 June 1575, at Lidlington, Bedfordshire, Susannah (n√©e Thorne), herself recorded as having been born on 5 March 1559/60 in Northamptonshire, and baptised at Yardley Hastings, the daughter of Thomas Thorne and Mary Purefoy, (the Purefoys being of noble descent).Richardson, Douglas; Everingham, Kimball; Faris, David (2004). Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families. Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Company, p. 600 He is reported to have been a Captain in the Earl of Leicester's militia, fighting with a commission from Elizabeth I, and under the banner of Henry of Navarre. He was thought to have died at the Battle of Ivry, France in 1590. However, the Reverend Cotton Mather of Boston wrote: \\"Thomas Dudley's father was Captain Roger Dudley, -- slain in the wars, when -- his son, and one only daughter were very young\\". The will of Thomas Dorne (Thorne) of Yardley Hastings, Gent., dated 29 Oct 1588, bequeathed \\"to the children of Susan Dudley, my Daughter, widow, ¬£10 to be equally divided\\". (S1,S11). Therefore, Roger was dead at the time of the will of his father-in- law, which, written in 1588, eliminates the Battle of Ivry as a possible date for his death. It is most probable that he died at the Siege of Zutphen in 1586, having followed his kinsman, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was a principal figure in that battle, which also claimed the life of Leicester's nephew Sir Philip Sidney. Marshall K. Kirk suggests that Roger made his home after his father's death with Peter Grey, a \\"Queen's servant\\", whose manor of Segenhoe was two miles from Lidlington, (Bedfordshire), where Roger was later married. Roger and Susannah Dudley orphaned five children or two (Thomas and a sister) The life of Mr. Thomas Dudley: Several times governor of the colony of Massachusetts by Cotton Mather: *Thomas Dudley (second governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony) *Mary Dudley *Richard Dudley (b. 1583 ‚Äì d. 20 Aug 1603) *Dorothy Dudley *David Dudley Susannah is recorded as having died in 1585 during childbirth, at St. Dunstan's, London and her name appears again three years later in a will, dated 29 October 1588, (Probate 9 May 1589), in which Thomas Thorne bequeaths... \\"to the Children of Susan Dudley, my Daughter...\\" (etc.) Roger and Susannah Thorne Dudley's children sired a vast progeny in America . Among many others who founded or were pillars of early New England communities, William Dudley, a son of David, was the first of this line in the family of the lords of Dudley to move to Connecticut, where he founded the settlement of Guilford on the shores of Long Island Sound. He emigrated to New England sometime between 1636 and 1643, a period corresponding to his uncle Thomas's political ascendancy in Massachusetts. Three of William Dudley's great grandsons were to give their family name to their new home in the Cornwall hills, when they moved to Owlsbury from Guilford in the mid 17th century. Owlsbury was renamed Dudleytown, and thereafter the persistent legend of America's most haunted town was born.

It is the oldest television society in the world. It currently has fourteen regional and national centres in the UK, as well as a branch in the Republic of Ireland. History The group was formed as the Television Society on 7 September 1927, a time when television was still very much in its experimental stage. Regular high-definition (then defined as at least 200 lines) broadcasts did not even begin for another nine years until the BBC began its transmissions from Alexandra Palace in 1936. In addition to serving as a forum for scientists and engineers, the society published regular newsletters charting the development of the new medium. These documents now form important historical records of the early history of television broadcasting. The society was granted its Royal title in 1966. The Prince of Wales became patron of the Society in November 1997. Activities The society regularly holds meetings and seminars, attended by members of the public and professionals from various areas of the television industry, and it also publishes the monthly magazine Television, covering a broad range of television topics. Major events held by the RTS include the biennial RTS Cambridge Convention, a three-day event held at King's College, Cambridge. The convention, chaired by one of the UK's major broadcasters, brings together influential figures from the television industry for a series of stimulating talks. The RTS also hosts \\"Anatomy of a Hit\\" events, which gather together the writers, cast and commissioner of some of Britain's most successful TV shows to discuss their qualities. Recent programmes discussed have included Sherlock, Doctor Who, and Humans. The society also holds a substantial archive of printed, photographic, and audio-visual material of value to television historians and scholars. Awards The Royal Television Society hosts six national award ceremonies annually: National Awards *RTS Programme Awards *RTS Television Journalism Awards *RTS Craft & Design Awards *RTS Student Television Awards *RTS Young Technologist Awards is given to this seen as potential future leaders in broadcasting technology. *RTS Pilgrim Awards acknowledges the outstanding work of RTS volunteers.

It also established a major base in the United Kingdom; and, mostly in the 20th century, it dominated the electric vacuum cleaner industry, to the point where the Hoover brand name became synonymous with vacuum cleaners and vacuuming in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Hoover was part of the Whirlpool Corporation, but was sold in 2006 to Techtronic Industries for $107 million. Hoover Europe/UK split from Hoover US in 1993, and had previously been acquired by Techtronic. In addition to producing floorcare products, Hoover was also an iconic domestic appliance brand in Europe, particularly well known for its washing machines and tumble dryers in the UK and Ireland, and also had significant sales in many parts of Europe. Today, the Hoover Europe brand, as part of the portfolio of brands owned by Haier remains a major player in the European white goods and floor care sectors in a number of countries. History Hoover factory and salesmen. The first upright vacuum cleaner was invented in June 1908 in Canton, Ohio by department store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler (1848‚Äì1915). Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the carpet sweeper he was using at work was the cause of his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a Bissell brand carpet sweeper then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper, \\"Carpet sweeper and cleaner\\", James M. Spangler, issued 2 June 1908 he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the dust bags. Production was slow, just two to three machines completed a week. Spangler then gave one of his Electric Suction Sweepers to his cousin Susan Troxel Hoover (1846‚Äì1925),https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86304877 who used it at home. Impressed with the machine, she told her husband and son about it. William Henry \\"Boss\\" Hoover (August 18, 1849 ‚Äì February 25, 1932)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/28102733 and son Herbert William Hoover Sr. (October 30, 1877 ‚Äì September 16, 1954)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22557 were leather goods manufacturers in North Canton, Ohio, which at the time was called New Berlin.\\"Legacy.\\" The Hoover Foundation website Hoover bought the patent from Spangler in 1908, founding the Electric Suction Sweeper Company with $36,000 capital, retaining Spangler as production supervisor with pay based on royalties in the new business. Spangler continued to contribute to the company, patenting numerous further Suction Sweeper designs until his death in 1915, when the company name was changed to the Hoover Suction Sweeper Company, with Spangler's family continuing to receive royalties from his original patent until 1925.Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, Volume 2 By John N. Ingham Hoover tents and factory Henry Dreyfuss and Hoover Henry Dreyfuss Patent for Dreyfuss' 150 design In the early 1930s, the company retained the services of Henry Dreyfuss, an up-and-coming industrial designer, to give the Hoover line-up a much needed update. Before Dreyfuss's involvement with the company, the majority of the machines manufactured consisted of a black motor and an aluminum base; this was the norm for more than twenty years. When Hoover introduced the 'Hedlite' in 1932, it was rather awkward and unattractive., \\"Suction cleaner\\", Harry B. White, issued 28 May 1935 Dreyfuss integrated this into the housing of the cleaner, making the machine more aesthetically pleasing and echoing the trends of streamline design. Of Dreyfuss's designs before 1936, he was able to update the basic Hoover machine and keep the company's products relevant with the times. In 1935, he was commissioned to completely redesign the Hoover cleaner. In 1936, for a fee of 25,000 USD, Dreyfuss sold Hoover the design which would become the Model 150 cleaner. For the first time since the introduction of the Hoover vacuum cleaner, the mechanical workings were completely concealed from sight by a Bakelite cover. This cover was a tear-drop styled shell, which seamlessly incorporated the headlight. Also, he totally revamped the base of the machine. Since the release of this design, all Hoover cleaners consisted of a fluid base and a hood to cover the electric motor. These designs suggested efficiency, cleanliness, and speed. Dreyfuss brought excitement and style to an otherwise mundane household appliance. His final design for the Hoover Company was the 1957 Convertible. Development Faced with a total lack of interest by the public in his expensive and unfamiliar new gadget, Hoover placed an ad in The Saturday Evening Post offering customers ten days' free use of his vacuum cleaner to anyone who requested it. Using a network of local retailers to facilitate the offer, Hoover thus developed a national network of retailers for the vacuums. By the end of 1908, the company had sold 372 Model 0s. By 1912, sales had been made to Norway, France, Russia, Belgium, Holland and Scotland. In 1919, Gerald Page-Wood ‚Äì an art director of Erwin, Wasey & Company, Hoover's advertising agency ‚Äì came up with a succinct slogan which summed up the Hoover's cleaning action: 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans'. At this time, it referred to the action of the revolving brushes, which vibrated the carpet and helped loosen the trodden-in grit. This offered an advantage over competitors' machines, which used suction alone to remove dirt, and therefore were not as efficient as the Hoover. Seven years later, the famous slogan would adapt to even more significance. Hoover's business began to flourish, and, a year after Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner., \\"Suction sweeper\\" Donald G. Smellie, Harry B White, Marvin E. Nulsen, issued 27 October 1931 Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, and led to a 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as \\"Positive Agitation\\". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. The Model 200 Duster and Model 575 upright, which used the same motor In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made. Herbert W. Hoover, Sr. took over as president of the company in 1922 and as Chairman of the Board of the Hoover Company in 1932. 1930 saw the introduction of the world's first handheld vacuum cleaner, the Hoover Dustette. The good design and exceptional durability of these machines mean many are still in service today, some at over 80 years old. In 1932, Hoover introduced a new optional headlamp called the Hoover Hedlite on Models 425, 750 and 900. By March 1932, it had become standard equipment on Models 750 and 900, and a $5 extra-cost option on Model 425. The Hoover Hedlite illuminated the floor ahead of the cleaner, useful for dimly-lit rooms and corridors, and under furniture. Several new slogans mentioned the light, including 'It shows you the dirt you never knew you had!', and 'It lights where it's going...it's clean where it's gone!'. In 1936, Hoover introduced top-of-the-line Model 150. It had a time to empty bag indicator;, \\"Indicator for suction cleaners\\", Harry B. White, issued 23 May 1939 automatic height adjustment; a magnesium body, which made it weigh less than previous models; instant tool conversion; and a two-speed motor. One of the first Dreyfuss designs for Hoover, it was the symbol of the machine age; the beautiful Bakelite hood hid the entire motor from view and there were no protruding knobs or gadgets. It was the first Hoover cleaner that was not of the traditional \\"coffee can\\" style, which Hoover had been using since its earliest years. The cleaner sold from 1936 to 1939 and was priced at $80 (which is about $1,500 to $2,000 in today's money). Two other lower priced Hoovers sold along with the 150: the Model 25 (1937‚Äì38),, \\"Design for a casing for suction cleaners or similar articles\\", Henry Dreyfuss, issued 4 May 1937 which was the middle of the line cleaner priced at $65; and the Model 300 (1935‚Äì38), \\"Design for a casing for a suction cleaner or similar article\\", Henry Dreyfuss, issued 10 November 1936 which became the bottom of the line cleaner and sold at $49.75. Due to the backdrop of the Depression, Hoover produced only 166,000 150s in its three-year production run. From 1941 to 1945, Hoover ceased all vacuum cleaner production and converted the North Canton, Ohio factory to support the war effort. When the war ended in 1945, Hoover started producing cleaners again and unveiled the Model 27 for post-war America to enjoy. In 1950, Hoover introduced the Veriflex, which was the first rubberized suction hose in the industry., \\"Method of making flexible hose for suction cleaners\\", F. A. Martin,issued 9 June 1953 Other cleaners at the time were using cloth-braided hoses, which would deteriorate and lose suction over time. In 1954, Herbert W. Hoover Jr. took over the presidency of the company from his father.\\"Obituary: Herbert Hoover Jr., 79, Company Head\\" The New York Times, May 23, 1997 A nephew of the founder, H. Earl Hoover, also served as chairman and honorary director.\\"H. Earl Hoover\\". The New York Times. November 16, 1985 Debut ad for the Hoover Model 29, the first Hoover cleaner made in red The sombre and restrained colors of the previous decades gave way to bright, striking modern color- schemes, starting with the Hoover Model 29 in 1950, which was red instead of the regular black and brown colors of the past., \\"Suction cleaner casing\\", Henry Dreyfuss, issued 15 May 1951 This was part of their policy of the continual development and modernization of their output. In 1957, Hoover introduced the Convertible Model 65 (the De Luxe 652 in the UK). It was the last machine designed by Henry Dreyfuss, the industrial designer who had worked with the company since the early 1930s., \\"Suction cleaner casing\\", Henry Dreyfuss, issued 1957 This cleaner introduced what Hoover called 'Automatic Shift', a system whereby the tool converter plugged into the rear of the cleaner. This was not a new idea: instant tool conversion had been introduced in 1936 with the Model 150 Cleaning Ensemble. However, new to Model 65, and slightly later in Britain on the 652A, was the introduction of a switch which automatically shifted the motor to a higher speed as the converter was inserted. The Convertible, or the Senior, in Britain, remains Hoover's worldwide best-selling cleaner. Although the domestic line was finally discontinued in 1993, a version called the Guardsman is still available in the commercial sector. 1963 saw the introduction of the Dial-A- Matic in the US ‚Äì sold in Australia as the Dynamatic, and in Britain as the Convertible. This was the first-ever clean-air upright cleaner. The clean-air principle is similar to the flow of air through a cylinder/canister cleaner. Rather than the dirt passing directly through the suction fan and being blown into the bag, it passes through the bag first, leaving only clean air to pass through the fan. This principle was soon adopted by many manufacturers, and continues to be used today. Also, the machine was constructed out of hard plastic. Hoover produced this cleaner from 1963 until the late 1970s in America. In the summer of 1969, Hoover further refined the Dial-A-Matic's design when they launched the 'Powerdrive' self-propulsion system on the Hoover model 1170. This idea took much of the effort out of pushing the cleaner, because, by using a system of gears, wheels, and belts, the cleaner used its own power to drive itself forward and backwards, the speed and direction being controlled entirely by the user though the 'Triple-Action' handgrip. The powerdrive feature on the model 1170 was so efficient, the user could push the bulky machine forward with one finger, and the feature could also be disengaged with a button on the handgrip so the machine could travel easily from room to room with the motor turned off, the machine was very difficult to push when the motor was turned off and the powerdrive was still activated. This was also the first vacuum cleaner available commercially that used the self-propulsion system. This extra technology made the Dial-A-Matic even heavier than the original, and at around $150, it was very expensive. The 'Powerdrive' system was carried over into the Concept range in 1978. The powerdrive system was later renamed \\"Self Propelled\\". Hoover continued to use this feature on many products of the 1980s and 1990s. It is still being used today by Hoover and numerous other companies. In 1986, the Hoover family sold the company. It was acquired by Maytag Corporation in 1989. On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it would discontinue production of washing machines and other laundry products at its Merthyr Tydfil factory, Mid Glamorgan from Saturday, 14 March 2009; giving the reason, the company stated that it could no longer manufacture competitively priced laundry products at the plant. Hoover had initially announced its closure intentions on Tuesday, 18 November 2008, beginning a period of staff consultation. The company was established in the town over sixty years ago, its factory at Pentrebach, Merthyr Tydfil, opening on 12 October 1948. Though 337 jobs were lost because of this decision, Hoover UK anticipated retaining its headquarters, logistics, storage and after sales service functions at the site, with some 113 workers retained.

The Junior was very popular in the UK; Hoover sold millions of them, and it became the biggest selling vacuum there. Various models were produced, with the final machine being manufactured in 1987. Hoover Limited made Juniors for export to the US from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. The exported Juniors were converted to American electrical standards by The Hoover Company in North Canton, Ohio. Finding a Hoover Junior in the USA is quite rare. The Junior was never referred to as such in the USA; it was tagged in official Hoover literature as the Lightweight Upright. The Dirtsearcher: Introduced again by Hoover Limited (UK) in 1969, was a development of the Junior with a Model 638 style headlamp fitted in place of the tool adaptor cover at the front. This model the 1354 went on to be the most successful UK Hoover manufactured model selling in both European and Commonwealth markets, however it was never sold in the US, although there were 110 V versions of the UK-market Juniors sold in Canada (such as the 1354A). They were sold alongside the Junior and Senior/Ranger models becoming the now rare models U1016 and U1040. The Portable: The Hoover Portable was launched by Hoover in 1963. It is a \\"Suitcase\\" type canister that did not have wheels; it would tugged around with by the user. When finished, the hose, attachments, and power cord would be stored inside the machine. In 1969, Hoover added wheels to the Portable. The Portable was manufactured until 1978. Also, it used the same motor as the Hoover Dial-A-Matic, the first clean-air upright. The Constellation: In 1954, Hoover introduced the Model 82 Constellation. It was a radically new design in cylinder and tank cleaners. Designed by Henry Dreyfuss,, \\"Suction cleaner\\", Henry Dreyfuss, 26 July 1955 it represented America's obsession with the space race. Its spherical shape resembled the planet Saturn and impersonated developing space technology. Its most memorable attribute was the ability to \\"walk on air\\", which eliminated the need for casters, wheels or runners. The cleaner was made mobile by using its exhaust air, which caused the cleaner to lift from the floor and float behind the user (starting with the Model 84). This was an engineering marvel in and of itself. The Constellation cleaner remained extremely popular in its close to 25-year run, with minor design modifications. The machine was discontinued in the mid-1970s with the introduction of the Hoover Celebrity; however, the Constellation was still produced in the UK well into the 1980s. The machine was so fondly remembered that it was reintroduced and sold from 2006 to 2009. Model 28: Introduced in 1946, Hoover produced over two million of this model for post-war America., \\"Design for a casing for suction cleaners or similar articles\\", Henry Dreyfuss, issued 22 August 1939 It sold from 1946 to 1950. Model 63: In 1953, Hoover debuted the 'deluxe' Model 63 for $116.95. It was the first Hoover to utilize a full wrap around bumper and a completely disposable dust bag. The cleaner was styled in two-tone baby blue (base) and navy blue (everything except the base). It was an extremely popular model and sold over four million units. The machine was produced from 1953 to 1956. It was sold, in smaller numbers, in the UK, as the model 638. Again, this machine was designed by Henry Dreyfuss. Hoovermatic; A long running line of top-loading twin-tub washing machines which ran from 1948 until 1993, sold mainly in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Hoovermatics were also sold in North America under the Washdog name. The machines used a unique washing action which made use of an impeller (known as a \\"Pulsator\\"), situated on the side of the wash tub, which revolved at high speed to create a moving current of water in the wash tub that dragged the laundry through the water. The Convertible: 1957 ushered in the \\"long, low and rarin' to go\\" Convertible. The name derives from the cleaner's ability to 'automatically shift' into a higher speed upon insertion of the tool converter for more powerful above the floor cleaning. Beginning with the Model 65, it soon became one of the most popular and well known cleaners in American history. The Convertible line was in production from 1957 to the early 1990s, and is still sold in variations in the commercial sector. The \\"Convertible\\" was also widely sold in the UK under the name \\"Senior\\": the Senior Cleaners were viewed to be the model for larger homes, and although it never outsold the Junior in Britain, it was still a massively popular cleaner.  The word \\"hoover\\"  In the UK and Ireland the term \\"hoover\\" (properly as a common noun) has long been colloquially synonymous with \\"vacuum cleaner\\" and the verb \\"to vacuum\\" (e.g., \\"you were hoovering the carpet\\"), referring to the Hoover Company's dominance there during the early 20th century. Despite Hoover no longer being the top seller of vacuum cleaners in the UK, the term \\"hoover\\" has remained as a genericised trademark.Post registration maintenance of a registered TrademarkPossible Generification of Hoover trademark by Elizabeth Ward Over the years, Hoover has expanded into other product lines, including kitchen appliances, hair dryers, speakers, and industrial equipment.  The Hoover Historical Center  Boyhood home (built 1853) of Hoover Company founder, William \\"Boss\\" Hoover: now the Hoover Historical Center In 1978, the Hoover Company opened a museum in the old Hoover home in North Canton, Ohio on the campus of Walsh University. It is called The Hoover Historical Center, and is dedicated to the history of the Hoover company in Canton. The museum exhibits include a number of non-Hoover hand-operated vacuum cleaners from before the company started, and displays of Hoover products throughout the company's history. Also on display are some of the munitions the company produced during World War II to help the war effort, and Hoover family personal items. Ownership transitions The Hoover plant in North Canton, Ohio. The company became publicly traded in the 1940s. Stock in Hoover was first sold on August 6, 1943, allowing the company to expand. In 1985, Hoover was purchased by the Chicago Pacific Corporation, and in 1989, Chicago Pacific was purchased by Maytag. In 1993, the Hoover Trading Company and Hoover UK merged to become the Hoover European Appliances Group. In 1995, Candy Group acquired the Hoover European Appliances Group in its entirety with the exclusive rights on the brand for the whole of Europe (including all territories of the former-Soviet Union), North Africa and selected countries in the Middle East.Candy Group History of Hoover In 2004, Maytag announced that it would consolidate its corporate office and back office operations in Newton, Iowa and close almost all of Hoover's overlapping functions. This effectively meant that most white-collar jobs at Hoover's North Canton location would be eliminated. The company had previously closed another manufacturing facility in Jackson Township, Stark County, Ohio, and the facility was sold to a church. Like many manufacturing companies in the United States, Hoover is experiencing pressures as consumers demand lower-priced goods. Hoover has operations in Mexico, where operating costs are lower than in the United States. After Maytag was acquired by Whirlpool in 2006, that firm reached an agreement to sell Hoover to Hong Kong, China-based firm Techtronic Industries.\\"Whirlpool to Sell Hoover Business For $107 Million to Techtronic.\\" Lam, J. The Wall Street Journal. December 7, 2006. TTI announced its intention to close the original plant in North Canton in September 2007. Hoover in Australia Since 1954, the Hoover factory at Meadowbank had manufactured washing machines and other products. A subsidiary of the US company, Hoover Australia merged with Chicago Pacific in 1985 and Maytag in 1989. Hoover Australia had its own administration, sales and marketing, large maintenance and engineering departments, a service division, and a much larger production workforce. At that time, in the early 1990s, Hoover was making healthy profits, as a result of investment in new technology and machinery through the late 1980s, a big drive towards quality improvement, and a very flexible workforce. In 1994, Hoover Australia was to be listed as a public company with a six-monthly operating profit of $8,850,000. That sparked a fight between Email Limited and Southcorp, two of Australia's largest white goods manufacturers for a commercial sale. Both companies were eager to strengthen their market share and further monopolise the whitegoods industry. In December 1994, Southcorp announced that it had bought Hoover Australia. In March 1996, Southcorp began a big rationalisation, sacking workers at the Hoover factory involved in maintenance, stores, administration and supervision. At the same time, Southcorp announced a big increase in their share price. In April, 1999, Southcorp Appliances, including Hoover, Dishlex and Chef, was sold, meaning that Email had obtained a conservative 60 per cent share of the Australian whitegoods market. After the Southcorp takeover, a culture of fear was introduced, based on a concerted campaign to strip all the indirect labour from the workforce, and a myth that the factory was inefficient and unproductive. Every month it was reported the factory was losing $1 million or more. Morale at the factory went into a downward spiral. That was followed by decisions to stop production of barrel and upright vacuum cleaners, followed by front-loading washing machines. They were replaced with imported products. Plastic moulding production was contracted out. The factory was being stripped of production, volume and jobs. A cost reduction campaign followed with good-quality components being replaced by inferior cheap components, and there was a complete breakdown of any real preventative maintenance program, which resulted in a large number of machine and equipment breakdowns. The reality, rather than the myth, was the Hoover Meadowbank site was being run into the ground by corporate decisions. In the late 1990s, Email closed the Meadowbank factory and integrated its whitegoods manufacturing into the Simpson plant in South Australia. The vacuum cleaner side of the business was sold to Godfreys. Several years later, Email itself was sold and broken up, and the whitegoods division of Email was sold to Electrolux. Shortly after taking ownership, Electrolux ceased leasing the Hoover brand name, and the manufacturing and supply of Hoover white goods ceased in Australia. As of 2019, Hoover whitegoods are now being sold through out Australia through several retailers. Free flights promotion In 1992, the British division of Hoover announced the Hoover free flights promotion, the demand for which rose far beyond the company's expectations, resulting in major costs and public relations problems for the British division and Maytag, which eventually led to its sale to the Italian manufacturer Candy. In 1993, legal action was started in the United Kingdom to take Hoover to court over the promotion, and was successful in Hoover v. Sandy Jack at the sheriff court in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Hoover Holiday Pressure Group furthered court action against Hoover at St Helens in Merseyside. Current products The products sold under the Hoover brand vary increasingly from one market to the next. For example, in the United States, the Hoover brand is used exclusively to sell floorcare products produced by TTI. Meanwhile, in the UK and most of Europe, Hoover branding appears on Candy Group products including white goods such as washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators, as well as floorcare products. Current details of the product range available to consumers can be found by visiting the Hoover website for the market of interest. Competition Since the lawsuit addressed in the next section, Hoover has lost its dominant position in the UK and in the United States and now faces strong competition from numerous brands. In the United States, Hoover's competition includes: Royal, Dirt Devil, Oreck, and Vax (all of which are owned by Hoover's Hong Kong owner Techtronic Industries);TTI Floor Care North America Kirby; Rexair; Eureka; Dyson; Electrolux; Panasonic; Bissell; and Kenmore (the house brand of American store chain Sears, which is manufactured predominantly by Panasonic and Sanyo). Dyson and Electrolux lead the list of UK competitors, followed by Bosch, Dirt Devil, SEBO, Vax, Morphy Richards, Miele, Bissell, Numatic (maker of the famous \\"Henry\\" cylinder cleaner), Zanussi, Russell Hobbs, LG, and others.

Over hundreds of years, custom grew to become law concerning maintenance and repairs, as first formally discussed in Stair's 1681 writings on Scots property law. In Scotland, these are now governed by the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004, which replaced the old law of the tenement and created a new system of common ownership and procedures concerning repairs and maintenance of tenements. Tenements with one or two room flats provided popular rented accommodation for workers, but in some inner-city areas, overcrowding and maintenance problems led to slums, which have been cleared and redeveloped. In more affluent areas, tenement flats form spacious privately owned houses, some with up to six bedrooms, which continue to be desirable properties. Tenements at Park Avenue and 107th Street, New York City, circa 1898‚Äì1910 In the United States, the term tenement initially meant a large building with multiple small spaces to rent. As cities grew in the nineteenth century, there was increasing separation between rich and poor. With rapid urban growth and immigration, overcrowded houses with poor sanitation gave tenements a reputation as slums. The expression \\"tenement house\\" was used to designate a building subdivided to provide cheap rental accommodation, which was initially a subdivision of a large house. Beginning in the 1850s, purpose-built tenements of up to six storeys held several households on each floor. Various names were introduced for better dwellings, and eventually modern apartments predominated in American urban living. In parts of England, especially Devon and Cornwall, the word refers to an outshot, or additional projecting part at the back of a terraced house, normally with its own roof.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 6th ed. Oxford: Oxford University, 2007, , p. 3804. History Gladstone's Land is a tenement from 1617 in the Old Town, Edinburgh. The term tenement originally referred to tenancy and therefore to any rented accommodation. The New York State legislature defined it in the Tenement House Act of 1867 in terms of rental occupancy by multiple households, as In Scotland, it continues to be the most common word for a multiple-occupancy building, but elsewhere it is used as a pejorative in contrast to apartment building or block of flats.For example, Heller, Vivian. The City Beneath Us: Building the New York Subways, New York Transit Museum, New York: Norton, 2004, , p. 34 quotes an Italian mason contrasting the better accommodations for the poor built in New York in response to a 1901 law with tenements: \\"We didn't call them tenements ... we called them apartment houses, because that's what they really were. To us, a tenement was a dump.\\" Tenement houses were either adapted or built for the working class as cities industrialized,Bauman, p. 6 . and came to be contrasted with middle-class apartment houses, which started to become fashionable later in the 19th century. Late-19th-century social reformers in the US were hostile to both tenements (for fostering disease, and immorality in the young) and apartment houses (for fostering \\"sexual immorality, sloth, and divorce\\").Hutchison, Janet. \\"Shaping Housing and Enhancing Consumption: Hoover's Interwar Housing Policy\\", From Tenements to the Taylor Homes pp. 81-101, p. 83 . Specific places =New York City= Soundview, The Bronx Side Sectional View of Tenement House, 38 Cherry Street, N.Y., 1865 As the United States industrialized during the 19th century, immigrants and workers from the countryside were housed in former middle-class houses and other buildings, such as warehouses, which were bought up and divided into small dwellings.Bauman, pp. 5-6.Fairbanks, Robert B. \\"From Better Dwellings to Better Neighborhoods: The Rise and Fall of the First National Housing Movement,\\" From Tenements to the Taylor Homes pp. 21-42, p. 22 . Beginning as early as the 1830s in New York City's Lower East Side or possibly the 1820s on Mott Street,Plunz, p. 161. three- and four-story buildings were converted into \\"railroad flats,\\" so called because the rooms were linked together like the cars of a train,Plunz, p. 164. with windowless internal rooms. The adapted buildings were also known as \\"rookeries,\\" and these were a particular concern, as they were prone to collapse and fire. Mulberry Bend and Five Points were the sites of notorious rookeries that the city worked for decades to clear. In both rookeries and purpose-built tenements, communal water taps and water closets (either privies or \\"school sinks,\\" which opened into a vault that often became clogged) were squeezed into the small open spaces between buildings. In parts of the Lower East Side, buildings were older and had courtyards, generally occupied by machine shops, stables, and other businesses.Nadel, Stanley. Little Germany: Ethnicity, Religion, and Class in New York City, 1845-80, Urbana: University of Illinois, 1990, , p. 34 . Lower East Side tenement buildings Charles Henry White, The Condemned Tenement, NY, 1906, National Gallery of Art Such tenements were particularly prevalent in New York, where in 1865 a report stated that 500,000 people lived in unhealthy tenements, whereas in Boston in 1845, less than a quarter of workers were housed in tenements. One reason New York had so many tenements was the large numbers of immigrants; another was that the grid plan on which streets were laid out, and the economic practice of building on individual 25- by 100-foot lots, combined to produce high land coverage.Plunz, p. 163. Prior to 1867, tenements often covered more than 90 percent of the lot, were five or six stories high, and had 18 rooms per floor, of which only two received direct sunlight. Yards were a few feet wide and often filled with privies. Interior rooms were unventilated. Early in the 19th century, many of the poor were housed in cellars, which became even less sanitary after the Croton Aqueduct brought running water to wealthier New Yorkers: the reduction in well use caused the water table to rise, and the cellar dwellings flooded. Early housing reformers urged the construction of tenements to replace cellars, and beginning in 1859 the number of people living in cellars began to decline.Plunz, p. 160. The airshaft of a dumbbell tenement, ca. 1900 Tenements. Brooklyn, Gold Street, 1890. Brooklyn Museum. A Sweltering Night in New York, 1883. Brooklyn Museum. The Tenement House Act of 1866, the state legislature's first comprehensive legislation on housing conditions, prohibited cellar apartments unless the ceiling was 1 foot above street level; required one water closet per 20 residents and the provision of fire escapes; and paid some attention to space between buildings.Plunz, pp. 167-68. This was amended by the Tenement House Act of 1879, known as the Old Law, which required lot coverage of no more than 65 percent. As of 1869, New York State law defined a ‚Äútenement house‚Äù as ‚Äúany house or building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied as the home or residence of three families or more living independently of each other, and doing their cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon any floor, so living and cooking, but having a right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets or privies, or some of them.‚Äù L 1867, ch 908. The New York City Board of Health was empowered to enforce these regulations, but it declined to do so. As a compromise, the \\"Old Law tenement\\" became the standard: this had a \\"dumbbell\\" shape, with air and light shafts on either side in the center (usually fitted to the shafts in the adjacent buildings), and it typically covered 80 percent of the lot.Plunz, p. 168. James E. Ware is credited with the design;* he had won a contest the previous year held by Plumber and Sanitary Engineer Magazine to find the most practical improved tenement design, in which profitability was the most important factor to the jury.Plunz, pp. 168-69. Public concern about New York tenements was stirred by publication in 1890 of Jacob Riis's How the Other Half Lives Riis, Jacob A., How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York. Repr. ed. Sam Bass Warner, Jr., Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap/Harvard University, 1970., and in 1892 by Riis's The Children of the Poor. Riis, 2018 [1892] The New York State Assembly Tenement House Committee report of 1894 surveyed 8,000 buildings with approximately 255,000 residents and found New York to be the most densely populated city in the world, at an average of 143 people per acre, with part of the Lower East Side having 800 residents per acre, denser than Bombay. It used both charts and photographs, the first such official use of photographs.Plunz, p. 172. Together with the publication in 1895 by the US Department of Labor of a special report on housing conditions and solutions elsewhere in the world, The Housing of Working People, it ultimately led to the passage of the Tenement House Act of 1901, known as the New Law, which implemented the Tenement House Committee's recommendation of a maximum of 70 percent lot coverage and mandated strict enforcement, specified a minimum of 12 feet for a rear yard and 6 feet for an air and light shaft at the lot line or 12 feet in the middle of the building (all of these being increased for taller buildings), and required running water and water closets in every apartment and a window in every room. There were also fire-safety requirements. These rules are still the basis of New York City law on low-rise buildings, and they have made single-lot development uneconomical.Plunz, p. 175. Most of the purpose-built tenements in New York were not slums, although they were not pleasant to be inside, especially in hot weather, so people congregated outside, made heavy use of the fire escapes, and slept in summer on fire escapes, roofs, and sidewalks.Girouard, pp. 312-13. The Lower East Side Tenement Museum, a five-story brick former tenement building in Manhattan that is a National Historic Site, is a museum devoted to tenements in the Lower East Side. Other famous tenements in the US include tenement housing in Chicago, in which various housing areas were built to the same affect as tenements in New York. =Edinburgh and Glasgow= Tenements in Dumbarton Road, Glasgow Tenements make up a large percentage of the housing stock of Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland. Glasgow tenements were built to provide high-density housing for the large number of people immigrating to the city in the 19th and early 20th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution, when the city's population boomed to more than 1 million people. Edinburgh's tenements are much older, dating from the 17th century onwards, and some were up to 15 storeys high when first built, which made them among the tallest houses in the world at that time. Glasgow tenements were generally built no taller than the width of the street on which they were located; therefore, most are about 3-5 storeys high. Virtually all Glasgow tenements were constructed using red or blonde sandstone, which has become distinctive. In Edinburgh, residential dwellings in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the medieval Old Town and Georgian New Town (as well as the Victorian city centre districts immediately surrounding them) are almost exclusively tenements. The Tenement House historic house museum in the Garnethill area of Glasgow preserves the interior, fittings and equipment of a well-kept, upper middle- class tenement from the late 19th century. Many tenements in Glasgow were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s because of slum conditions, overcrowding and poor maintenance of the buildings. Perhaps the most striking case of this is seen in the Gorbals, where virtually all the tenements were demolished to make way for tower blocks, many of which have in turn have been demolished and replaced with newer structures. The Gorbals is a relatively small area and at one time had an estimated 90,000 people living in its tenements, leading to very poor living conditions; the population now is roughly 10,000. Tenement demolition was to a significantly lesser extent in Edinburgh, thus making its later World Heritage designations in 1985 possible. Largely, such clearances were limited to pre-Victorian buildings outwith the New Town area and were precipitated by the so-called \\"Penny Tenement\\" incident. Apartments in tenement buildings in both cities are now often highly sought after, due to their locations, often large rooms, high ceilings, ornamentation and period features. =Berlin= Meyers Hof in Berlin, 1910 In German, the term corresponding to tenement is Mietskaserne, \\"rental barracks\\", and the city especially known for them is Berlin. In 1930, Werner Hegemann's polemic Das steinerne Berlin (Stony Berlin) referred to the city in its subtitle as \\"the largest tenement city in the world.\\"Hegemann, Werner. Das steinerne Berlin: Geschichte der gr√∂ssten Mietkasernenstadt der Welt, Berlin: Kiepenheuer, 1930. They were built during a period of great increases in population between 1860 and 1914, particularly after German unification in 1871, in a broad ring enclosing the old city center, sometimes called the Wilhelmian or Wilhelmine Ring. The buildings are almost always five stories high because of the mandated maximum height.Related to the width of the street, but generally the maximum, 72 feet: Girouard, p. 329. The blocks are large because the streets were required to be able to handle heavy traffic, and the lots are therefore also large: required to have courtyards large enough for a fire truck to turn around, the buildings have front, rear, and cross buildings enclosing several courtyards.Worbs, p. 145.Girouard, pp. 337-38 says that the blocks had been intended to be subdivided with side streets. Buildings within the courtyards were the location of much of Berlin's industry until the 1920s, and noise and other nuisances affected the apartments, only the best of which had windows facing the street.Elkins, pp. 20, 126, 164-67. Members of a tenants' collective in front of their tenement building in East Berlin in 1959 (the fa√ßade still pockmarked with 1945 battle damage) One notorious Berlin Mietskaserne was in Gesundbrunnen,Hake, Sabine. Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2008, , p. 30. which at times housed 2,000 people and required its own police officer to keep order.Reese, Dagmar. Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2006, , p. 165 . Between 1901 and 1920, a Berlin clinic investigated and documented in photographs the living conditions of its patients, revealing that many lived in damp basements and garrets, spaces under stairs, and apartments where the windows were blocked by courtyard businesses.Republished as Hinterhof, Keller und Mansarde: Einblicke in Berliner Wohnungselend 1901-1920, ed. Gesine Asmus, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1982, . Many apartments in the Wilhelmian Ring were very small, only one room and a kitchen.Elkins, p. 189. Also, apartments were laid out with their rooms reached via a common internal corridor, which even the Berlin Architects' Association recognized was unhealthy and detrimental to family life.Worbs, p. 146. Sanitation was inadequate: in a survey of one area in 1962, only 15 percent of apartments had both a toilet and a bath or shower; 19 percent had only a toilet, and 66 percent shared staircase toilets. Heating was provided by stoves burning charcoal briquettes.Elkins, p. 190. =Dublin= Dublin slum dwellers, 1901 In the 19th and early 20th century, Dublin's tenements () were infamous, often described as the worst in Europe. Many tenement buildings were originally the Georgian townhouses of upper-class families, neglected and subdivided over the centuries to house dozens of Dublin's poor. Henrietta Street's fifteen buildings housed 835 people. In 1911 nearly 26,000 families lived in inner-city tenements, and 20,000 of these families lived in a single room. Disease was common, with death rates of 22.3 per thousand (compared with 15.6 for London at the same time). The collapse of 65‚Äì66 Church Street in 1913, which killed seven residents, led to inquiries into housing. A housing committee report of 1914 said, Tenement life often appeared in fiction, such as the \\"Dublin trilogy\\" of plays by Se√°n O'Casey, Oliver St. John Gogarty's play Blight, and James Plunkett's novel Strumpet City (adapted for television in 1980). 14 Henrietta Street serves as a museum of Dublin tenement life. The last tenements were closed in the 1970s, families being rehoused in new suburbs such as Ballymun. Conventillo in La Boca, Buenos Aires =Buenos Aires= In Buenos Aires the tenements, called conventillos, developed from subdividing one- or two-story houses built around courtyards for well-off families. These were long and narrow, three to six times as long as they were wide, and the size of the patios was reduced until as many as 350 people could be living on a lot that had originally housed 25. Purpose-built tenements copied their form. By 1907 there were some 2,500 conventillos, with 150,000 occupants.Girouard, p. 338. El conventillo de la Paloma was particularly famous and is the title of a play by Alberto Vaccarezza. =Mumbai= A chawl in Mumbai \\"Chawls\\" are found in India. They are typically four to five story buildings with 10 to 20 kholis (tenements) on each floor, kholis literally meaning 'rooms'. Many chawl buildings can be found in Mumbai, where chawls were constructed by the thousands to house people migrating to the large city because of its booming cotton mills and overall strong economy. A typical chawl tenement consists of one all-purpose room, which functions both as a living and sleeping space, and a kitchen which also serves as a dining room. A frequent practice is for the kitchen to also serve as a bedroom for a newly married couple in order to give them some degree of privacy. =Poland= Tenements in Warsaw Old Town, Market Square Kamienica (plural kamienice) is a Polish term describing a type of residential tenement building made of brick or stone, with at least two floors. There are two basic types: one designed as a single-family residence, which existed until ca. 1800 (a burgher house), and the other designed as multi-family housing, which emerged in the 19th century and was the basic type of housing in cities. From the architectural point of view, the word is usually used to describe a building that abuts other similar buildings forming the street frontage, in the manner of a terraced house. The ground floor often consists of shops and other businesses, while the upper floors are apartments. Kamienice have windows in the front, but not in the side walls, since the buildings are close together. The first type of kamienica is most prevalent especially in centres of historical cities such as Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, Wroc≈Çaw, and Toru≈Ñ, whereas the second type is most prominent in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The name derives from the Polish word kamie≈Ñ (stone) and dates from the 15th century.Maria Bogdani-Czepita and Zbigniew Zuziak, Managing Historic Cities, Krak√≥w: International Cultural Centre, 1993, , p. 194 .Tomasz Torbus, Poland, Nelles guides, Munich: Nelles, 2001, .

Dante supposedly grew up across the street in what is now called the 'Casa di Dante', rebuilt in 1910 as a museum to Dante (though in reality unlikely to be his real home). He would have heard the monks singing the Mass and the Offices here in Latin Gregorian chant, as he famously recounts in his Commedia: \\"Florence, within her ancient walls embraced, Whence nones and terce still ring to all the town, Abode aforetime, peaceful, temperate, chaste.\\" In 1373, Boccaccio delivered his famous lectures on Dante's Divine Comedy in the subsidiary chapel of Santo Stefano, just next to the north entrance of the Badia's church. History The abbey was founded as a Benedictine institution in 978 by Willa, Countess of Tuscany, in commemoration of her late husband Hubert, and was one of the chief buildings of medieval Florence. A hospital was founded in the abbey in 1071. The church bell marked the main divisions of the Florentine day. Between 1284 and 1310 the Romanesque church was rebuilt in Gothic style by famous Italian architect and sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio, but in 1307 part of the church was demolished to punish the monks for non-payment of taxes. The church underwent a Baroque transformation between 1627 and 1631. The prominent campanile, completed between 1310 and 1330, is Romanesque at its base and Gothic in its upper stages. Its construction was overseen by the famous chronicler Giovanni Villani. Today the Badia is the home to a congregation of monks and nuns known as the Fraternit√† di Gerusalemme. They have sung vespers at 6pm and mass at 6:30pm every day. Locals and tourists alike claim attending their Vespers or Mass to be one of the most beautiful experiences in Florence. The legend tells that Dante saw for the first time Beatrice in this church. Artworks Ex libris from the library of Badia Fiorentina Major works of art in the church include the Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard (c. 1486) by Filippino Lippi (originally commissioned by Piero del Pugliese for his chapel at Chiesa di Santa Maria del Santo Sepolcro or delle Campora) and the tombs of Willa's son Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany (died 1001) and the lawyer and diplomat Bernardo Giugni (1396-1456), both by Mino da Fiesole (latter completed c. 1466). The murals in the apse were completed by Giovanni Domenico Ferretti in 1734. The attached Chiostro degli Aranci (Cloister of the Oranges) contains a fresco cycle (c. 1435-1439) on the life of St Benedict, rooted in the context of the Badia's revitalizing by a prominent monastic reformer of Portuguese origin, Abbot Dom Gomes Eanes (OSB) (\\"Beato Gomezio\\" in the contemporary Italian sources) (c. 1383-1459).For the history of the Badia during this period see A catalogue of the correspondence of Abbot Gomes (a collection of original letters partly deposited in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana and partly in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze), is in the process of being published (2014) by the Portuguese Studies Review (http://www.trentu.ca/admin/publications/psr/21_1.html). The first part of the catalogue is now available for preview and download at: Many attribute the frescos to the Portuguese painter Giovanni di Consalvo, a generally unknown follower of Fra Angelico. They are more likely the work of Zanobi di Benedetto Strozzi(1412‚Äì68) under the guidance of Angelico himself. The fourth scene in the cycle was repainted c. 1526-1528 (St. Benedict chastising himself) by the young Bronzino. The cloister itself was built under the direction of Antonio di Domenico della Parte and Giovanni d'Antonio da Maiano, with some assistance by Bernardo Rossellino.* The Badia Polyptych by Giotto, now at the Uffizi Gallery, was originally located in the church. In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the polyptych being carried out of the Santa Croce basilica. He reasoned that it had been removed from the Badia during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed at Santa Croce. Procacci also realized that the altarpiece was too large for the site of the current altar at the Badia. He discovered that a 1628 renovation had resulted in a change of the altar's location, as well as the demolishment of two and a half walls at the original site. The remaining left half of the rear wall had been covered by a new wall. As the polyptych was being restored in 1958, Procacci had a hole chiseled at the top of the more recent wall and found that the original wall was frescoed. The later wall was removed over six months, and three scenes were revealed: an Annunciation, a Presentation of Jesus at the Temple and Joachim Among the Shepherds. However, all but one head depicted in the frescoes, that of a shepherd, had been removed in the 1628 renovation.

The company is headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky. Since 2016 it has been jointly owned by a consortium of three Chinese companies: Apex Technology, PAG Asia Capital, and Legend Capital. History Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, Kentucky Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when investment firm Clayton & Dubilier completed a leveraged buyout of IBM Information Products Corporation, the printer, typewriter, and keyboard operations of IBM. Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995. It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for US$3.6 billion. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction. Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015. The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and \\"rebranded\\" to Kofax. As part of the sale, the Perceptive Business Unit portion of Lexmark's Enterprise Software Services division (e.g. their non-Kofax branded document management products) was sold to the Thoma Bravo management group who agreed to in-turn sell the Perceptive Business Unit to the Hyland Corporation. The Kofax branded applications remained as part of Lexmark, but other document management systems like Perceptive Content and NolijWeb and products like Intelligent Capture (formerly \\"Brainware\\") and Enterprise Search (formerly \\"ISYS\\") were absorbed by Hyland. Operations The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and R&D; offices are distributed globally with additional R&D; facilities located in Boulder, Colorado, US; Lenexa, Kansas, US; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden and Irvine, California, US. Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. As of July 2018, the company had approximately 9,000 employees worldwide. Acquisitions * In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings. Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (‚Ä≥Perceptive Content‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥ImageNow‚Ä≥) and document output management applications. * In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million. The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management, document output management and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services. * In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million. Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems. * In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million. ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software. * In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software. * In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million. * In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million. * In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR, a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million. * In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.Big acquisition brings Perceptive Software opportunity and layoffs Bizjournals.com, September 19, 2014 ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud. * In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion. Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, US was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations. This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016. Inkjet exit In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line. Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base. In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¬•9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets. Legal cases Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years. A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the \\"single use only\\" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges. Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Arizona Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n Inc. v. Lexmark International Inc., when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.

Most of his photographs were first published by Berenice Abbott after his death. Though he sold his work to artists and craftspeople, and became an inspiration for the surrealists, he did not live to see the wide acclaim his work would eventually receive. Biography Atget's birthplace in Libourne Jean-Eug√®ne-Auguste Atget was born 12 February 1857 in Libourne. His father, carriage builder Jean-Eug√®ne Atget, died in 1862, and his mother, Clara-Adeline Atget n√©e Hourlier died shortly after; he was an orphan at age seven. He was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Bordeaux and after finishing secondary education joined the merchant navy.Paris: pp. 240‚Äì246Photographers A‚ÄìZ: p. 17 Atget moved to Paris in 1878. He failed the entrance exam for acting class but was admitted when he had a second try. Because he was drafted for military service he could attend class only part-time, and he was expelled from drama school. Still living in Paris,12 Rue des Beaux-Arts he became an actor with a travelling group, performing in the Paris suburbs and the provinces. He met actress Valentine Delafosse Compagnon, who became his companion until her death. He gave up acting because of an infection of his vocal cords in 1887, moved to the provinces and took up painting without success. When he was thirty he made his first photographs, of Amiens and Beauvais, which date from 1888. In 1890, Atget moved back to Paris5 Rue de la Piti√© and became a professional photographer, supplying documents for artists: studies for painters, architects, and stage designers. Starting in 1898, institutions such as the Mus√©e Carnavalet and the Biblioth√®que historique de la ville de Paris bought his photographs. The latter commissioned him ca. 1906 to systematically photograph old buildings in Paris. In 1899 he moved to Montparnasse. 17bis Rue Campagne-Premi√®re While being a photographer Atget still called himself an actor, giving lectures and readings. During World War I Atget temporarily stored his archives in his basement for safekeeping and almost completely gave up photography. Valentine's son L√©on was killed at the front. In 1920‚Äì21, he sold thousands of his negatives to institutions. Financially independent, he took up photographing the parks of Versailles, Saint-Cloud and Sceaux and produced a series of photographs of prostitutes. Berenice Abbott, while working with Man Ray, visited Atget in 1925, bought some of his photographs, and tried to interest other artists in his work. She continued to promote Atget through various articles, exhibitions and books, and sold her Atget collection to the Museum of Modern Art in 1968.Anne Tucker, Profile of Berenice Abbott, The Woman's Eye (Alfred A. Knopf, 1973), p. 77. In 1926, Atget's partner Valentine died,Paris: pp. 240‚Äì246 and before he saw the full- face and profile portraits that Abbott took of him in 1927, showing him ‚Äúslightly stooped‚Ä¶tired, sad, remote, appealing‚Äù, Atget died on August 4th in 1927, in Paris.Photographers A‚ÄìZ: p. 17 Photographic practice Avenue des Gobelins (1927) Atget took up photography in the late 1880s, around the time that photography was experiencing unprecedented expansion in both commercial and amateur fields.Hambourg, Maria M. \\"The Collection.\\" MoMA.org. Oxford University Press, n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013. Atget photographed Paris with a large-format wooden bellows camera with a rapid rectilinear lens, an instrument that was fairly current when he took it up, but which he continued to use even when hand-held and more efficient large-format cameras became available. The optical vignetting often seen at some corners of his photographs is due to his having repositioned the lens relative to the plate on the camera‚Äîexploiting one of the features of bellows view cameras as a way to correct perspective and control perspective and keep vertical forms straight. The negatives show four small clear rebates (printing black) where clips held the glass in the plate-holder during exposure. The glass plates were 180√ó240mm Bande Bleue (Blue Ribbon) brand with a general purpose gelatin- silver emulsion,Hambourg, M.M. 1980. Eug√®ne Atget 1857-1927: The Structure of the Work.

After taking a photograph, Atget would develop, wash, and fix his negative, then assign the negative to one of his filing categories with the next consecutive number that he would write the negative number in graphite on the verso of the negative and also scratch it into the emulsion. He contact-printed his negatives onto pre-sensitized, commercially available printing-out papers; albumen paper, gelatin-silver printing-out paper, or two types of matte albumen paper that he used mainly after WW1. The negative was clamped into a printing frame under glass and against a sheet of albumen photographic printing out paper,Reilly, J.M. 1980. The Albumen and Salted Paper Book: the History and Practice of Photographic Printing 1840-1895. Rochester: Light Impressions NY. which was left out in the sun to expose. The frame permitted inspection of the print until a satisfactory exposure was achieved, then Atget washed, fixed and toned his print with gold toner, as was the standard practice when he took up photography.Price, B.A. and K. Sutherland. 2005. 'Looking at Atget's and Abbott's Prints: The Photographic Materials.' In Barberie, Peter. Looking at Atget. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. 103-120. Atget did not use an enlarger, and all of his prints are the same size as their negatives. Prints would be numbered and labelled on their backs in pencil then inserted by the corners into four slits cut in each page of albums. Additional albums were assembled based on a specific themes that might be of interest to his clients, and separate from series or chronology.Camille Moore, An Analytical Study of Eug√®ne Atget's Photographs at the Museum of Modern Art. In Topics in Photographic Preservation 2007, Volume 12, Article 28. pp. 194-210  Subject matter  By 1891 Atget advertised his business with a shingle at his door, remarked later by Berenice Abbott, that announced ‚ÄúDocuments pour Artistes‚Äù. Initially his subjects were flowers, animals, landscapes, and monuments; sharp and meticulous studies centred simply in the frame and intended for artists' use. Atget then embarked on a series of picturesque views of Paris which include documentation of the small trades in his series Petits M√©tiers. He made views of gardens in the areas surrounding Paris, in the summer of 1901, photographing the gardens at Versailles, a challenging subject of large scale and with combinations of natural and architectural and sculptural elements which he would revisit until 1927, learning to make balanced compositions and perspectives. Early in the 1900s, Atget began to document ‚ÄúOld Paris,‚Äù reading extensively in order to sympathetically focus on Paris architecture and environments dating prior to the French Revolution, concern over the preservation of which ensured him commercial success.Harris, D. 1999. Eug√®ne Atget: Unknown Paris. New York: The New Press He framed the winding streets to show the historic buildings in context, rather than making frontal architectural elevations.Kozloff, Max. 'Abandoned and Seductive: Atget's Streets'. In The Privileged Eye: Essays on Photography (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1987). Atget's specialisation in imagery of Old Paris expanded his clientele. Amongst his scant surviving documents was his notebook, known by the word Repertoire on its cover (the French repertoire meaning a thumb-indexed address book or directory, but also defined, aptly in actor Atget's case, as 'a stock of plays, dances, or items that a company or a performer knows or is prepared to perform'). The book is now in the MoMA collection, and in it he recorded the names and addresses of 460 clients; architects, interior decorators, builders and their artisans skilled in ironwork, wood panelling, door knockers, also painters, engravers, illustrators, and set designers, jewellers Ren√© Lalique and Weller, antiquarians and historians, artists including Tsuguharu Foujita, Maurice de Vlaminck and Georges Braque, well-known authors, editors, publishers Armand Colin and Hachette, and professors, including the many who donated their own collections of his photographs to institutions. The address book lists also contacts at publications, such as L‚ÄôIllustration, Revue Hebdomadaire, Les Annales politiques et litteraires, and l‚ÄôArt et des artistes. Institutional collectors of Old Paris documents, including archives, schools, and museums were also a keen clientele and brought him commercial success, with commissions from the Bibliot√®que Historique de la Ville de Paris in 1906 and 1911 and the sale of various albums of photographs to the Bibliot√®que NationaleNesbit, M. 1992. Atget‚Äôs Seven Albums. New Haven: Yale University Press. Atget's photographs attracted the attention of, and were purchased by, artists such as Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp and Picasso in the 1920s, as well as Maurice Utrillo, Edgar Degas and Andr√© Derain, some of whose views are seen from identical vantage-points at which Atget took pictures, and were likely made with the assistance of his photographs bought from the photographer for a few cents. By the end of his career, Atget had worked methodically and concurrently on thirteen separate series of photographs including 'Landscape Documents', 'Picturesque Paris', 'Art in Old Paris', 'Environs', 'Topography of Old Paris', 'Tuileries', 'Vielle France', 'Interiors', 'Saint Cloud', 'Versailles', 'Parisian Parks', 'Sceaux' and a smaller series on costumes and religious arts, returning to subjects after they had been put aside for many years.  Surrealist appropriation  Man Ray, who lived on the same street as Atget in Paris, the rue Campagne-Premi√®re in Montparnasse purchased and collected almost fifty of Atget's into an album embossed with the name 'Atget', \\"coll. Man Ray\\" and a date, 1926. He published several of Atget's photographs in his La R√©volution surr√©aliste; most famously in issue number 7, of June 15, 1926, his Pendant l‚Äô√©clipse made fourteen years earlier and showing a crowd gathered at the Colonne de Juillet to peer through various devices, or through their bare fingers, at the Solar eclipse of April 17, 1912. Atget however did not regard himself as a Surrealist.Dana Macfarlane, 'Photography at the Threshold: Atget , Benjamin and Surrealism'. In History of Photography, 34, no. 1 (2010): 17-28. When Ray asked Atget if he could use his photo, Atget said: \\"Don't put my name on it. These are simply documents I make.\\"Atget quoted by Ray in Paul Hill and Ton1 Cooper, 'Interview: Man Ray'. In Camera 74 (February 1975): 39-40. Man Ray proposed that Atget's pictures of staircases, doorways, ragpickers, and especially those with window reflections and mannequins, had a Dada or Surrealist quality about them.Barberie, Peter. \\"Looking at Atget\\" (New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 2005) p53‚Äì56 Recognition in America After Atget's death his friend, the actor Andr√© Calmettes, sorted his work into two categories; 2,000 records of historic Paris, and photographs of all other subjects. The former, he gave to the French government; the others he sold to the American photographer Berenice Abbott,Worswick, C. 2002. Berenice Abbott and Eug√®ne Atget. Santa Fe, NM: Arena Editions.

Log in. Web. 22 Feb. 2013. When Berenice Abbott reportedly asked him if the French appreciated his art, he responded ironically, \\"No, only young foreigners.\\" While Ray and Abbott claimed to have 'discovered' him around 1925, he was certainly not the unknown 'primitive' 'tramp' or 'Douanier Rousseau of the street' that they took him for; he had, since 1900, as counted by Alain Fourquier, 182 reproductions of 158 images in 29 publications and had sold, between 1898 and 1927 and beyond the postcards he published, sometimes more than 1000 pictures a year to public institutions including the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Biblioth√®que Historique de la Ville de Paris, Mus√©e Carnavalet, Mus√©e de Sculpture Compar√©, √âcole des Beaux-Arts, the Directorate of Fine Arts and others. During the Depression in the 1930s Abbott sold half of her collection to Julian Levy, who owned a gallery in New York. Since he had difficulty selling the prints, he allowed Abbott to keep them in her possession. In the late 1960s Abbott and Levy sold the collection of Atgets to The Museum of Modern Art. As MoMA bought it, the collection contained 1415 glass negatives and nearly 8,000 vintage prints from over 4,000 distinct negatives. The publication of his work in the United States after his death and the promotion of his work to English-speaking audiences was due to Berenice Abbott. She exhibited, printed and wrote about his work, and assembled a substantial archive of writings about his portfolio by herself and others.See Peter Barr's PhD dissertation \\"Becoming Documentary: Berenice Abbott's Photographs 1925‚Äì1939\\" (Boston University, 1997). Also: Berenice Abbott & Eug√®ne Atget by Clark Worswick. Abbott published Atget, Photographe de Paris in 1930, the first overview of his photographic oeuvre and the beginning of his international fame. She also published a book with prints she made from Atget's negatives: The World of Atget (1964).The World of Atget Horizon Press, New York 1964 Berenice Abbott and Eugene Atget was published in 2002. As the city and architecture are two main themes in Atget's photographs, his work has been commented on and reviewed together with the work of Berenice Abbott and Amanda Bouchenoire, in the book Structure and harmony. Cities and architectures, where the author Jerome Saltz analyzes historicist perspectives and considers their aesthetic implications: \\"(...) the three authors coincide in the search for and exaltation of intrinsic beauty in their objectives, regardless of quality and clarity of their references.\\"Saltz, Jerome (2020).

OLID: OL29533524M, p. 42  Legacy  In 1929, eleven of Atget's photographs were shown at the Film und Foto Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart. The U.S. Library of Congress has some 20 prints made by Abbott in 1956. The Museum of Modern Art purchased the Abbott/Levy collection of Atget's work in 1968. MoMA published a four-volume series of books based on its four successive exhibitions of Atget's life and work, between 1981 and 1985. In 2001, the Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the Julien Levy Collection of Photographs, the centerpiece of which includes 361 photographs by Atget.Peter Barberie, Looking At Atget (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2005), vi. Many of these photographs were printed by Atget himself and purchased by Levy directly from the photographer. Others arrived in Levy's possession when he and Berenice Abbott entered a partnership to preserve Atget's studio in 1930. Eighty-three prints in the Levy Collection were made by Abbott posthumously as exhibition prints that she produced directly from Atget's glass negatives.Peter Barberie, Looking At Atget (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2005), 58. Additionally, the Levy Collection included three of Atget's photographic albums, crafted by the photographer himself.Peter Barberie, Looking At Atget (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2005), 15-17. The most complete is an album of domestic interiors titled Int√©rieurs Parisiens D√©but du XXe Si√®cle, Artistiques, Pittoresques & Bourgeois. The other two albums are fragmentary. Album No. 1, Jardin des Tuileries has only four pages still intact, and the other lacks a cover and title but contains photographs from numerous Parisian parks. In total, the Philadelphia Museum of Art holds approximately 489 objects attributed to Atget. Atget, a Retrospective was presented at the Biblioth√®que Nationale of Paris in 2007. The Atget crater on the planet Mercury is named after him, as is Rue Eug√®ne- Atget in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Although no statement by Atget about his technique or aesthetic approach survives, he did sum up his life's work in a letter to the Minister of Fine Arts; Copyright The U.S. Library of Congress was unable to determine the ownership of the twenty Atget photographs in its collection, thus suggesting that they are technically orphan works. Abbott clearly had a copyright on the selection and arrangement of his photographs in her books, which is now owned by Commerce Graphics. The Library also stated that the Museum of Modern Art, which owns the collection of Atget's negatives, reported that Atget had no heirs and that any rights on these works may have expired.

Biography Giovanni Costa, Donne che imbarcano legna a Porto d'Anzio, painted 1850‚Äì52; now in the Galleria nazionale d'arte moderna, Rome Giovanni Costa was born in Rome on 15 October 1826, the fourteenth of the sixteen children of Gioacchino Costa (died 1842) and Maria Chiappi (died 1857). His father was from Santa Margherita Ligure and as a young man had moved to Rome, where he opened a wool-spinning factory and achieved wealth and position. The family lived in a large house in Piazza San Francesco a Ripa, in Trastevere, close to the factory. When he was 12 Giovanni was introduced to the neo-classical painter Baron Vincenzo Camuccini, who encouraged him to work from nature and from what he saw around him. Soon after was sent to the Jesuit college at Montefiascone, where remained for five years. Costa returned to Rome in 1843, the year after the death of this father, and for two years attended the Collegio Bandinelli in the via Giulia, founded by Bartolommeo Bandinelli in 1678, where he was taught drawing by Luigi Durantini. He then worked for short time in the studio of Vincenzo Camuccini before entering the schools of the Accademia di San Luca, where he studied under Francesco Coghetti, Francesco Podesti and Filippo Agricola. He fought under Garibaldi in 1848, and served as a volunteer in the war of 1859; his enthusiasm for Italian unity was actively shown again in 1870, when he was the first to mount the breach in the assault of Rome near the Porta Pia. Strada in pianura, 1890 He had settled meanwhile at Florence, where his fight for the independence of art from worn-out traditions was no less strenuous. Here he completed a Donne sulla spiaggia di Porto d'Anzio (Girl on the Beach of Porto d'Anzio). He also became known as a landscape- painter of remarkable originality, and of great influence in the return to minute observation of nature. He painted, mainly rustic scenes involving herders and cattle. He was a major inspiration to the artists known as the Macchiaioli, and also had many English and American friends and followers, notably Elihu Vedder, Matthew Ridley Corbet (1850‚Äì1902) and his wife Edith Corbet, and Lord Carlisle, and was closely associated with Corot and the Barbizon school, whom he met while visiting Paris.. In 1853, he established a lifetime friendship with a young Frederick Leighton, who was then sojourning in Rome. His exile from Rome lasted until 1862. An exhibition of his pictures was held in London in 1904, and he is represented in the Tate Gallery. He died at Marina di Pisa on 31 January 1903.

Career Hart was born in Oakland, California, and spent some time in Carroll County, Mississippi, in his youth, where he was influenced by the Mississippi country blues performed by his relatives. Hart is known as one of the world's foremost practitioners of country blues. He is also known as a faithful torchbearer for 1960s and 1970s guitar rock, as well as western swing and traditional country. His style has been compared to Lead Belly and Spade Cooley. Bluesman Taj Mahal once said about Hart: \\"The boy has got thunder in his hands.\\" Hart himself said, \\"I guess my big break came when I opened for Taj Mahal for four nights at Yoshi's.\\" His debut album, Big Mama's Door, came out in 1996. In 2003, Hart's album Down in the Alley was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album. In 2005, Hart received a Grammy Award for his contribution to Beautiful Dreamer ‚Äì The Songs of Stephen Foster. Hart was featured in the 2003 Wim Wenders film The Soul of a Man, which was featured in Martin Scorsese's film series The Blues. Hart was also featured in the documentary Last of the Mississippi Jukes. Hart appeared in the film The Great Debaters in 2007, playing a 1930s juke-joint musician. In 2010, Hart teamed up with friends Jimbo Mathus and Luther Dickinson to form the South Memphis String Band. Their first album, Home Sweet Home, was nominated for ‚ÄúBest Acoustic Album‚Äù at the 2011 Blues Foundation Music Awards. The group released a second album, Old Times There, in early 2012.

Since its description in 1831, three subspecies of the giant golden-crowned flying fox have been recognized, one of which is extinct. The extinct subspecies (A. jubatus lucifer) was formerly recognized as a full species, the Panay golden-crowned flying fox. Formerly, this species was placed in the genus Pteropus; while it is no longer within the genus, it has many physical similarities to Pteropus megabats. It is one of the largest bat species in the world, weighing up to --only the Indian and great flying fox can weigh more. It has the longest documented forearm length of any bat species at . It is primarily frugivorous, consuming several kinds of fig. However, its diet also includes some leaves. It forages at night and sleeps during the day in tree roosts. These roosts can consist of thousands of individuals, often including another species, the large flying fox. Not much is known about its reproduction; it gives birth annually from April through June, with females having one pup at a time. Predators of the giant golden-crowned flying fox include raptors such as eagles, the reticulated python, and humans. Owing to deforestation and poaching for bushmeat, it is an endangered species. Though national and international law makes hunting and trade of this species illegal, these regulations are inadequately enforced, meaning that the species is frequently hunted nonetheless. Even in roosts that are more stringently protected from poaching, it is still affected by human disturbance via tourists who intentionally disturb them during the day. Taxonomy The giant golden-crowned flying fox was described as a new species in 1831 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz. Eschscholtz placed it in the genus Pteropus with a scientific name of Pteropus jubatus. Its species name \\"jubatus\\" is from Latin, meaning \\"having a mane or crest, crested\\". The holotype had been collected on the Philippine island of Luzon during an expedition led by Otto von Kotzebue. The genus Acerodon was described six years later in 1837, with A. jubatus as the type species for the new genus. As of 2005, three subspecies of the giant golden-crowned flying fox are recognized: *A. jubatus jubatus (Eschscholtz, 1831) *A. jubatus mindanensis K. Andersen, 1909 *A. jubatus lucifer (Elliot, 1896) A. jubatus lucifer had been described as Pteropus lucifer in 1896 by Daniel Giraud Elliot. A. jubatus lucifer, commonly the Panay golden-crowned flying fox, is still sometimes considered an extinct species of megabat. However, a 1998 publication noted that there were no morphological differences that distinguish A. jubatus lucifer from A. jubatus. This publication was used by Mammal Species of the World and the IUCN as justification as listing A. jubatus lucifer as a subspecies of A. jubatus rather than as a full species. Description Skull of the golden-crowned flying fox Overall, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is similar in appearance to many Pteropus species. It is different, however, in its smaller canine teeth and its larger and more complex molars and premolars. Its upper incisors are slightly longer than Pteropus species, as well as sharper. Its four lower incisors have a greater disparity in length between the inner and outer pair than do Pteropus. Its dental formula is for a total of 34 teeth. Illustration of giant golden-crowned flying fox skeleton The giant golden-crowned flying fox is one of the largest bat species in the world. It is among the heaviest of all bat species, with individuals weighing up to . The only bat species known to weigh more than the giant golden-crowned flying fox are the Indian flying fox (Pteropus medius) and great flying fox (Pteropus neohibernicus), with a maximum weight of and respectively. It does, however, have the longest forearm length of any species, measuring up to . The great flying fox has a slightly shorter forearm length, and its wingspan is thus presumed to be lesser as well. The wingspan of the Indian flying fox is up to , while the giant golden-crowned flying fox has a wingspan of . This species is somewhat dimorphic, with males slightly larger than females in many cranial and external measurements. The giant golden-crowned flying fox gets its common name from its fur coloration. It has golden coloration that begins between its eyes and terminates to a narrow \\"V\\" shape at the nape of its neck, though sometimes extending to the upper shoulders. The sides of its face, brows, and throat are black, while the sides of its neck and upper back are maroon; this maroon fur transitions into brownish black, which then grades into reddish brown down the back. On its ventral (belly) side, its fur is generally black, though the front of the neck may have a maroon tinge and its belly may be interspersed with yellow hairs. Its hindlimbs are covered with brownish black fur, and its flight membranes are pale brown. Biology and ecology =Diet and foraging= Ficus variegata, a species of fig consumed by the giant golden-crowned flying fox The giant golden-crowned flying fox is largely frugivorous, though it also consumes plant leaves (folivorous). One study found that it is particularly dependent on Ficus fruits (figs), with Ficus seeds found in 79% of all fecal pellets. Especially common Ficus seeds were from the Urostigma subgenus (which includes Ficus species commonly referred to as banyan), as well as Ficus variegata. The results support that the primary food group is composed of fig species, including Ficus subcordata and unidentified leaves. There is a lack of consensus on whether items found frequently in the fecal samples are actually prioritized or found as an alternative food for these bats. Multiple types of figs can also contribute to different nutrients for the species. Frugivorous bats usually do not consume foods rich in protein. The overconsumption of fruits, paired with leaves may contribute to an adequate amount of protein in their diet. Figs are superior sources of calcium, which may also aid in their growth to adults. Like nearly all megabats, giant golden-crowned flying foxes cannot echolocate, and thus rely on sight to navigate. This species likely commutes long distances between its roost and foraging grounds. Individuals who roosted on the island of Maripipi, for example, were documented traveling more than to access sites on another island, Biliran. =Roosting and behavior= Giant golden-crowned flying foxes are nocturnal, sleeping for most of the day. They do engage in some social and maintenance behaviors during the day at times, with solitary behaviors such as self-grooming, excreting waste, and wing flapping more prevalent in the afternoon and social behaviors such as fighting and mating in the morning. It forms harmonious mixed species colonies with another megabat, the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus). When time to leave the roosts for nightly foraging, the two species will head in the same direction. In the 1920s, colonies of these two species would number as many as 120,000 individuals. As of 1992, the largest of these colonies was 5,000; many, however, were only several hundred individuals. =Reproduction= Little is known about mating and reproduction of the giant golden-crowned flying fox. The litter size is one individual, with females likely producing no more than one litter per year. It has also been speculated that females may only give birth every other year. Based on limited observation, it is thought that females may not reach sexual maturity until two years of age. On Negros Island, females gave birth in April or May; based on other observations, females likely give birth during this time across its range. On the island of Maripipi, young were born in late May and June. =Predators, parasites, and disease= One of the avian predators of the giant golden-crowned flying fox, the Philippine eagle The giant golden-crowned flying fox is impacted by ectoparasites (external parasites) including Cyclopodia horsfieldi, which is a species of fly in the family Nycteribiidae (\\"bat flies\\"). It is preyed on by several raptors including the Philippine eagle, white-bellied sea eagle, and possibly the Brahminy kite. Non-avian predators include the reticulated python and humans. Like many bat species, the giant golden-crowned flying fox has been investigated as a source of emerging infectious disease. One study tested for the presence Reston virus, a kind of Ebolavirus that affects some primates (though not humans), in a population of giant golden-crowned flying foxes at Subic Bay. Of fifty-six individuals tested for Reston virus, three were seropositive, meaning that they tested positive for antibodies against the virus. Range and habitat  Individual fitted with a GPS tracking device for research on habitat use and movement The giant golden-crowned flying fox is endemic to the Philippines; it was the first endemic species of that country to be described, which it was in 1831. Surveys reported in 2005 and 2011 documented this species on the islands of Bohol, Boracay, Cebu, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros and Polillo. It was formerly found on the island of Panay, though this population has been extirpated. It is a forest specialist, occurring mostly at elevations from sea level to . It prefers areas uninhabited by humans. A 2005 study found none in inhabited areas. The same study also revealed that these bats use river corridors called riparian zones more than originally thought, because the fig trees located near rivers are the bats' main source of food. They like to be close to agricultural fields, but only in undisturbed forest areas. Conservation As of 2016, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its population likely declined by more than 50% from 1986-2016\\\\. One of the largest factors in its decline is hunting for bushmeat. Its large body size means that it is an easier target than many other bats. The practice of shooting the giant golden-crowned flying fox at its roosts results in excessive mortality, as dead individuals may not fall from the tree, and wounded individuals may glide some distance before falling. Therefore, a poacher may kill as many as thirty bats to recover ten. The giant golden-crowned flying fox is threatened by deforestation and has completely disappeared from many islands in the Philippines, such as Panay and most of Cebu. Since 1900 the total forest coverage of the Philippines has been reduced from 70% to 20%. Less than 10% of the original lowland forest cover now remains. Negros, an island part of its range, retains only 4% of its original forest coverage. Subic Bay, Philippines Internationally, the giant golden-crowned flying fox is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In 1990, two of the three subspecies (A. j. lucifer and A. j. mindanensis) were included on CITES Appendix II, meaning that trade of the taxa was strictly regulated. In 1995, however, the species was placed CITES Appendix I. Appendix I is stricter than Appendix II, meaning that commercial trade of the species is only legal in exceptional circumstances. Nationally, the species is protected by the 2001 Philippine Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, though this law is inadequately enforced. While the majority of its roost are within protected areas, illegal hunting occurs at a wide scale even within such areas. Three of its roosts are largely protected from poaching, however. On the island of Boracay, local landowners protect the roost from hunting disturbance. The local governments of Subic Bay and Mambukal protect another two roosts. Even though hunting pressures are lessened at these three roosts, the giant golden- crowned flying fox contends with other sources of disturbance. Tourists and their guides deliberately disturb the bats by clapping their hands or rapping on tree trunks to make the bats fly. In addition to keeping the bats from sleeping, these behaviors result in the separation of offspring from their mothers. In 2013, Bat Conservation International (BCI) listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation. Actions that BCI has taken to promote its conservation include partnering with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to protect its roosts, as well as educate Filipinos about bats. Some captive breeding programs exist for the species, though it is uncertain if they are sufficient to make up for population declines seen in the wild.

It lived in North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs during the Hemingfordian to the end of Hemphillian from around 17.5 to 4.9 million years ago.(Prothero, 2005)  Description  Restoration of T. fossiger T. proterum and Barbourofelis loveorum Teleoceras had much shorter legs than modern rhinos, and a barrel chest, making its build more like that of a hippopotamus than a modern rhino. Osborn based on this, suggested in 1898 that it was semi-aquatic and hippo like in habits. This idea persisted for around a century, but has recently been discounted by isotopic evidence. Teleoceras is now thought to have been a terrestrial grazer on C3 plants. Teleoceras had a single small nasal horn.  Discovery  Teleoceras is the most common fossil in the Ashfall Fossil Beds of Nebraska. In fact, its remains were so numerous and concentrated that the building housing the greatest concentration of Ashfall fossils is called the \\"Rhino Barn\\". Most of the skeletons are preserved in a nearly complete state. One extraordinary specimen includes the remains of a Teleoceras calf trying to suckle from its mother.Ashfall Fossil Beds This animal was featured in the episodes \\"Are Rhinos Dinos?\\" and \\"Dawn Of The Cats\\" of the Paleoworld series.  Extinction  Teleoceras went extinct in North America alongside Aphelops at the end of the Hemphillian, most likely due to rapid climate cooling, increased seasonality and expansion of C4 grasses, as isotopic evidence suggests that the uptake of C4 plants was far less than contemporary horses.

The two ships in the class-- and , were named after the redeemed cities of Trento and Trieste taken from the Austro-Hungarian empire after the victory in World War I. The ships were very lightly armored, with only a thick armored belt, though they possessed a high speed and heavy armament of eight guns. Nominally built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two cruisers nevertheless exceeded the displacement limits imposed by the treaty. In the interwar period, the two cruisers served in the Cruiser Division, frequently alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, the first was a tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer. Trento was torpedoed and sunk by a British torpedo bomber and a submarine in June 1942 with heavy loss of life. In April 1943, Trieste was also sunk in port at La Maddalena during an attack by United States heavy bombers. Salvage operations began in 1950, and after it was determined that the ship's engines had been preserved by leaked fuel oil, the hull was sold to the Spanish Navy, which planned to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The plan was eventually cancelled in 1956 due to rising costs of the project, and Trieste was broken up for scrap in 1959.  Design  In the early 1920s, the Regia Marina began design studies for cruisers that would adhere to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to a displacement of and an armament of guns. The design for what became the Trento class was prepared by General Filippo Bonfiglietti in 1923.Brescia, p. 72-73 In 1924, the French Navy laid down the first of two s, prompting the Regia Marina to order two vessels to match their rival.Marriott, p. 50 The designers emphasized very high speed, which required a significant reduction in armor protection to keep the ships within the displacement limit. In addition, they were designed with a narrow beam to help them reach high speeds, which reduced their stability. This would be the general pattern for Italian cruisers and destroyers built in the 1920s and 1930s, with the exception of the later s and some of the later s.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 283 While the ships were still on the slipways, officers in the Regia Marina expressed concerns that the thin armor protection of the Trentos would leave the vessels poorly equipped for combat. As a result, the navy ordered the more balanced Zara-class, which featured a significantly thicker scale of armor protection.Brescia, p. 76 The lightly- built Trento design nevertheless provided the basis for the s built by Odero Terni Orlando for the Argentine Navy; the Argentine vessels were scaled down slightly, with thinner armor and guns.Friedman, p. 263 Another derivative design built for the Italian fleet, , started construction in 1930 and was commissioned in 1933; though the Bolzano was quite different from the other two vessels, she is sometimes considered a member of the Trento class.Marriott, p. 156 =General characteristics= Line-drawing of the Trento class The ships of the Trento class were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They had a design displacement of and they displaced up to at full load, though their displacement was nominally within the 10,000-long-ton restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. Their hulls had a flush deck and a bulbous bow, the first time the latter feature was employed on an Italian warship.Brescia, p. 73 The ships were completed with a pair of tripod masts, though on trials they were found to vibrate excessively, and the foremast was strengthened with two extra legs. They had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men, though during the war this increased to 781. They carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 291Brescia, p. 72 The Trento-class cruisers' power plant consisted of four Parsons steam turbines powered by twelve oil-fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms with four each; two powered the forward engines that drove the outboard propellers and the remaining four were allocated to the turbines that drove the center shafts. The engines were rated at for a top speed of , with projected service performance of for at normal displacement. On sea trials, Trieste only reached and Trento managed slightly less than that; these speeds could only be reached on a very light displacement, and in service, her practical top speed was only . The ships had a storage capacity of of fuel oil, which provided a cruising range of at a speed of . During refits in early 1940, funnel caps were added to reduce smoke interference with the masts.Brescia, pp. 72, 74Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 291-292 =Armament and armor= Bow view of Trento; note the very close mounting of the turret guns Trento and Trieste were armed with a main battery of eight Mod 24 50-caliber guns in four gun turrets; each turret carried the guns in a single cradle rather than independent mounts. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft, and allowed for elevation to 45 degrees, for a maximum range of . They had a rate of fire of three rounds per minute, and the guns had to reset to 15 degrees to reload. The turrets were electrically operated, including the training and elevation gear and the ammunition hoists.Campbell, p. 328 The guns suffered from excessive shell dispersion, like many other Italian guns of the period. Initially supplied with shells fired at a muzzle velocity of , the shells and propellant charges were reduced--to at --in an unsuccessful attempt to tighten shell grouping. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells.Friedman, p. 310 In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together; this caused the shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to the dispersion problem.Brescia, pp. 73-74 Fire control was provided by a pair of Barr & Stroud coincidence rangefinders.Friedman, pp. 263-264 Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and four machine guns. The 100 mm guns were copies of Austro-Hungarian guns designed in 1910 by ≈†koda that were placed in newly designed dual-purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of . In addition to the gun armament, they carried eight torpedo tubes in four deck mounted twin launchers.Campbell, p. 339 The ships' secondary batteries were revised several times during their careers. Both ships had their 100 mm guns replaced with newer Mod 31 versions of the same caliber. In 1937-1938, the two aft-most 100 mm guns were removed, along with all four 12.7 mm machine guns; eight 54-cal. Breda M1932 guns and eight Breda M1931 machine guns, all in twin mounts, were installed in their place. In 1942, Trento received four 65-cal. Breda M1940 guns in single mounts, with Trieste receiving eight of those guns the following year.Campbell, pp. 345-347 Both vessels were protected with an armored citadel that covered the ships' vitals, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. The vertical armored belt was thick and ran from forward of the fore main battery turrets to aft of the rear turrets. Either end of the belt was capped with armored bulkheads thick on the upper portion; the forward bulkhead had a lower section that was reduced to , and the aft bulkhead's lower portion was reduced to . Their armor deck was 50 mm thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to aft, with thick sloped sides. The armor deck did not extend forward of the citadel. The gun turrets had thick plating on the faces and the supporting barbettes they sat in were 70 mm thick above the armor deck and 60 mm thick below. The main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and a 50 mm thick roof; above the tower was a fire control director with thick sides and a 60 mm thick roof. Ships {class=wikitable - valign=top !

During the pre-war period, Trento made lengthy trips abroad, including a tour of South America from May to October 1929 and a deployment to China from January to June 1932 to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. Both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Mikl√≥s Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. In 1938 Trieste helped transport soldiers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (Corps of Volunteer Troops), which had been sent to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War, back to Italy in 1938.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 2, 10 After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, Trento and Trieste saw extensive action against British forces in the Mediterranean Sea, including at the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan in July and November 1940 and March 1941, respectively. Trento was present at Calabria, where she battled British cruisers but did not sustain any damage.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 2-3, 11 At the Battle of Cape Spartivento, either Trento or Trieste scored a hit on the British cruiser ,Greene & Massignani, p. 119O'Hara, pp. 70-71 and Trieste was briefly engaged but not seriously damaged by the battlecruiser .Stern, p. 62 At Cape Matapan, the two cruisers engaged several British cruisers at very long range, with neither side scoring any hits.Greene & Massignani, pp. 150‚Äì151 In November 1941, Trieste was torpedoed by the submarine ; she spent most of the next year under repair. In the meantime, Trento was also present during the inconclusive First and Second Battles of Sirte, and at the latter she severely damaged a British destroyer. Both cruisers were also frequently tasked with escorting convoys to supply Italian forces in North Africa as well as interdicting British convoys to the island of Malta in the central Mediterranean. During one of the latter missions to attack the British Operation Harpoon convoy in June 1942, Trento was torpedoed twice, first by a Bristol Beaufighter torpedo bomber and then sunk by the submarine with very heavy loss of life on 15 June;Hogg & Wiper, p. 3, 10-11 out of a wartime complement of 51 officers and 1,100 enlisted men, 549 were killed in the sinking, and a further 21 later died of wounds.Fioravanzo, p. 312 Trieste returned to action in August 1942 for an operation that was cancelled following the torpedoing of another Italian cruiser by a British submarine. Trieste was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943. Salvage work on Trieste began in 1950. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to La Spezia; an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into the machinery spaces, protecting them while the ship had been submerged. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952 and had her towed to Ferrol, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The project ultimately came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project, forcing its cancellation in 1956. She was ultimately broken up by 1959.Hogg & Wiper, p. 11 Notes References    * Category:Cruiser classes Category:World War II cruisers of Italy Category:Ships built in Italy ","title":"Trento-class cruiser"},{"id":"854795","text":"Jeremiah Joyce (1763-1816) was an English Unitarian minister and writer. Life He was born 24 February 1763 at Mildred's Court London. He became a glass-painter, but on the death of his father and with the support of his brother, Joshua, he studied for the Unitarian ministry, where he became proficient in mathematics and Latin. Later he became tutor to the sons of Earl Stanhope. Joyce had radical political views, became a member of the Society for Constitutional Reform and of the London Corresponding Society. On 4 May 1794 he was arrested at Stanhope's house in Kent on a charge of 'treasonable practices', and examined by the Privy Council, where he refused to answer any questions without a lawyer, which he was refused. He remained in custody until 19 May when, with others, he was committed to the Tower of London on a charge of High Treason. They were arraigned at the Old Bailey on 25 October. After the acquittal of some of his co-defendants, charges against him were dropped. Joyce had suffered twenty three weeks imprisonment. Joyce was for many years the secretary of the Unitarian Society. At the time of his death, 21 June 1816, he was minister of the precursor to Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel at Hampstead. Joyce married Elizabeth Harding (niece of Captain Fagg) in 1796 and the youngest of his six children, Hannah (born the year before Joyce died, later married William Ridyard), went to live with his friend William Shepherd.

Caplan (born 1950), is the Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor of Bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center and the founding director of the Division of Medical Ethics. Caplan has made many contributions to public policy including: helping to found the National Marrow Donor Program; creating the policy of required request in cadaver organ donation adopted throughout the United States; helping to create the system for distributing organs in the U.S.; and advising on the content of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, rules governing living organ donation, and legislation and regulation in many other areas of health care including blood safety and compassionate use. Early life and education Born in Boston in 1950 to Sidney D. and Natalie Caplan, Arthur Caplan grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts. He has described his family as \\"Workmen's Circle, Zionist, and secular.\\" He credits his background of Judaism with stimulating his interest in methods of inquiry and argument. At age six, Caplan was diagnosed with polio. He was successfully treated at Children's Hospital in Boston and went on to play sports at Framingham North High School. Caplan has stated that this life-threatening illness was a formative experience that influenced his later commitment to philosophy and bioethics. Caplan did his undergraduate work at Brandeis University, where he majored in philosophy. There he met his future wife Jane. Their son, Zachary, was born in 1984. Caplan's second wife, Meg Brennan Caplan, is the medical center director of the Bronx VA Medical Center. Caplan did his graduate work at Columbia University, receiving an M.A. in 1973, an M.Phil. in 1975, and a Ph.D. in the history and philosophy of science in 1979. His dissertation, Philosophical Issues Concerning the Synthetic Theory of Evolution, was co-supervised by Ernest Nagel and Sidney Morgenbesser. Caplan worked with Nagel as a teaching assistant and was the final graduate student of Nagel's career. During his time at Columbia, Caplan met psychoanalyst and Dean of Education Bernard Schoenberg. Schoenberg allowed him to participate as both an observer and a medical student in clinical rotations in the university's medical college, first experiencing \\"ethics in action.\\" Career In 1977, Caplan met Daniel Callahan, a philosopher who co-founded The Hastings Center (now in Garrison, New York) with psychiatrist Willard Gaylin. In 1977, Caplan joined The Hastings Center, first as a junior research assistant and then as a post- doctoral fellow. He spent the next 10 years at the center, serving as the associate director from 1985 to 1987. During this time, Caplan published many papers on genetics (including the ethics of genetic testing and screening), evolution, sociobiology, and the teaching of ethics. He also became involved in the ethics of human and animal experimentation and new medical technologies, applying philosophy in public discourse and speaking on public policy issues. In 1987, Caplan moved to the University of Minnesota, where he became a professor in the Departments of Philosophy and Surgery and the first director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics. In 1989, he organized the Center for Bioethics Conference on Medical Ethics and the Holocaust, the first conference convened to discuss bioethics and the Holocaust. During his time at Minnesota he was active on issues relating to organ transplantation and genetics and worked with Rosalie A. Kane on dilemmas of \\"everyday ethics\\" involving treatment of the elderly. He also wrote about bioethics in relation to the Holocaust. In 1992, he joined the Medical Advisory Council of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Caplan secured the first apology for the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, from Lewis Sullivan, M.D., then secretary of HHS, in 1991. He worked with William Seidelman, M.D., and others to secure in 2012 an apology from the German Medical Association for the role of German physicians in Nazi prison experiments during the Holocaust. In May 1994, Caplan went to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He founded the Center for Bioethics and the Department of Medical Ethics and had professorial appointments in a variety of departments including Medicine and Philosophy. In the mid-1990s, he and colleagues conducted the first empirical studies on organ donor eligibility and donation rates. In 2009, the Sidney D. Caplan Professor of Bioethics was established at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, named for Caplan's father. Arthur Caplan became the first holder of the professorship. While at the University of Pennsylvania, he became the first bioethicist to be sued for his professional role, after his involvement in a gene therapy trial that resulted in the death of research subject Jesse Gelsinger. The family‚Äôs suit was settled with the University for an undisclosed amount of money, in exchange for, among other things, dropping Caplan from the suit. Daily Pennsylvanian, ‚ÄúGene therapy suit settled out of court‚Äù, Stacy Humes-Schulz, November 6, 2000; https://www.thedp.com/article/2000/11/gene_therapy_suit_settled_out_of_court The federal government‚Äôs suit on the same facts was settled for $500,000. In 2009, Caplan helped develop the first flu vaccine mandate at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and, later, New York state's policy to require health care workers to \\"vaccinate or mask.\\" Also in 2009, he called for tightening restrictions on fertility clinics and IVF and has written extensively in favor of embryonic stem cell research. In 2012, Caplan came to New York University's Langone Medical Center as the Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor of Bioethics and the founding director of the Division of Bioethics. In May 2015, Caplan launched, with pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, a pilot project for the equitable distribution of experimental drugs outside ongoing clinical trials. He created the Compassionate Use Advisory Committee (CompAC), a panel of bioethicists, physicians, and patient advocates, to respond to appeals from terminally ill patients for a cancer drug in development by J&J.; It is believed to be the first of its kind in the pharmaceuticals industry. Recent activity has included spearheading a movement to relax restrictions on blood donations by gay men and urging postponement of the Rio Summer Olympics because of the Zika virus threat. In early May 2020, the United States Conference of Mayors announced the Mayors Advisory Panel on Sports, Recreation & Health, with Caplan as a co-chair, to \\"advise mayors and sports and recreation officials on safe policies and practices as cities reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\" MarketWatch featured Caplan in an article on the life of a bioethicist during the Covid-19 pandemic on Aug. 4, 2020. Caplan has been criticized by some classical philosophers for his \\"hands-on philosophy\\" and by some colleagues for his enthusiastic engagement with the media. In response he has said: \\"To me, the whole point of doing ethics is to change people, to change behavior. Why else do it?\\" Academic work Caplan is the author or editor of more than 35 books and more than 750 papers in peer-reviewed journals of medicine, science, philosophy, bioethics, and health policy. He is a regular contributor to WebMD's Medscape and a regular commentator on WGBH (FM)'s \\"Boston Public Radio\\" and WMNF Tampa's \\"Everyday Ethics\\" podcast. He is a frequent guest and commentator on various other media outlets, discussing public health issues like obesity, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus, and vaccination. He has been co-director of the Joint Council of Europe/United Nations Study on Trafficking in Organs and Body Parts. He was the co-director of a United Nations/Council of Europe Study on organ trafficking. He has called for a new international convention on criminal organ trafficking. He has spoken out on international issues such as organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China. He instituted a boycott by leading medical journals of papers about transplantation coming from China. Internationally, he was the chair of the Advisory Committee to the United Nations on Human Cloning and served on the special advisory committee to the International Olympic Committee on genetics and gene therapy. Caplan has served on a number of national committees, including as chair of the National Cancer Institute Biobanking Ethics Working Group and chair of the Advisory Committee to the Department of Health and Human Services on Blood Safety and Availability. He was a member of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses and the special advisory panel to the National Institute of Mental Health on human experimentation on vulnerable subjects. He is an adviser to DARPA on synthetic biology and has addressed the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. He has also served on the ethics committee of the American Society of Gene Therapy. Caplan has consulted with many corporations, not-for-profit organizations, and consumer organizations. He is on the board of trustees of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. He also sat on the board of the National Center for Policy Research on Women & Families, the Franklin Institute, the Iron Disorders Foundation, and the National Disease Research Interchange. He chaired the advisory committee on bioethics at Glaxo from 2005 to 2008. Awards and honors Caplan has been elected as a fellow of The Hastings Center (1990), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1994), the College of Physicians of Philadelphia (1994), the New York Academy of Medicine (1997), and an honorary fellow of the American College of Legal Medicine (2008). Caplan was named a person of the Year in 2001 by USA Today. In December 2008, Discover magazine named him one of the 10 most influential people in science, for ‚Äùtranslating philosophical debates into understandable ideas‚Äù and ‚Äúdemocratizing bioethics.‚Äù He is one of the 10 most influential people in America in biotechnology, according to the National Journal; one of the 10 most influential people in the ethics of biotechnology, according to Nature Biotechnology; one of the 50 most influential people in American health care, according to Modern Health Care magazine; and one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology, according to Scientific American magazine.

However, runners gradually lost contact with the leaders in the second half of the race, until at 35 km, only Hwang and K≈çichi Morishita from Japan remained. They had quite a memorable struggle, until Hwang broke free after 40 km to win a gold medal. Hwang raced sparingly after Barcelona, and he retired after injury prevented him from representing South Korea in the 1996 Olympics. Hwang was depicted on the 2006 Berlin Marathon medal to commemorate his victory in the 1992 Olympic marathon event. South Koreans' Olympic marathon medals Hwang has been one of two Korean athletes to win the Olympic marathon. The other winner was Sohn Kee- chung. Hwang's contemporary South Korean athlete Lee Bong-Ju won the silver medal in the marathon at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, and Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin at the same race that Sohn Kee-chung won.

Eisenhower which dissolved the Territory of Hawaii and established the State of Hawaii as the 50th state to be admitted into the Union. Statehood became effective on August 21, 1959. Hawaii remains the most recent state to join the United States. Hawaii statehood and international law Prior to 1959, Hawaii was an organized incorporated territory of the United States. The territory was established in 1900 by the Hawaiian Organic Act. In 1946, the United Nations listed Hawaii as a non-self-governing territory under the administration of the United States (Resolution 55(I) of 1946-12-14). Also listed as non-self-governing territories under the jurisdiction of the United States were Alaska Territory, American Samoa, Guam, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Statehood vote Copy of an official ballot (inset) and referendum results approving the Admission Act Out of a total population of 600,000 in the islands and 155,000 registered voters, 140,000 votes were cast, the highest turnout ever in Hawaii. The vote showed approval rates of at least 93% by voters on all major islands. Of the approximately 140,000 votes cast, fewer than 8,000 rejected the Admission Act of 1959. =Opposition to statehood= The acceptance of statehood for Hawaii was not without its share of controversy. There were Native Hawaiians who protested against statehood. Prior to admission, various bills creating the state were stalled in congressional hearings since the early 1900s. There was a fear of establishing a state that was governed by an ethnic minority, namely the large Asian American population. Some lawmakers worried about the of Hawaii's residents to the United States, in light of protests and possibly split loyalties. Upon the election of John A. Burns from the Hawaii Democratic Party as delegate of the Territory of Hawaii to Congress, southern leaders charged that Burns' election was evidence of Hawaii as a haven for communism. Burns, in 1959, would reflect on the obstacles against the statehood campaign and place more emphasis on the resistance to statehood in the islands, rather than in Washington itself. > The reasons why Hawaii did not achieve statehood, say, ten years ago‚Äîand one > could without much exaggeration say sixty years ago‚Äîlie not in the Congress > but in Hawaii. The most effective opposition to statehood has always > originated in Hawaii itself. For the most part it has remained under cover > and has marched under other banners. Such opposition could not afford to > disclose itself, since it was so decidedly against the interests and desires > of Hawaii's people generally.John A. Burns, \\"Statehood and Hawaii's People,\\" > State Government 32 (Summer 1959): 132 =Southern lawmakers= Burns was involved in vigorous lobbying of his colleagues persuading them that the race-based objections were unfair and charges that Communist sympathizers controlled Hawaii were false. Burns worked especially hard with the southern Democrats, led by Lyndon Johnson, who blocked the various Hawaii statehood bills. Upon leaving her seat as delegate from Hawaii, Elizabeth P. Farrington said, \\"Of course, Lyndon Johnson was no friend of statehood.\\" Farrington added, \\"There were 22 times when he voted against us. He did everything he could, because he was representing the Southern racial opposition.\\" She claimed Johnson had a fear that Hawaii would send representatives and senators to Congress who would oppose segregation, in spite of Johnson's record as a supporter of civil rights for blacks. Johnson ultimately changed his position and voted in favor of statehood for Hawaii. =Alice Kamokila Campbell= On the 53rd anniversary of the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, January 17, 1946, Territorial Senator Alice Kamokila Campbell, one of the few voices that opposed statehood for Hawaii, offered her testimony to the joint congressional committee sent to investigate and report on statehood. Kamokila Campbell testified at Iolani Palace in front of a small crowd of 600 to frequent applause. There she stated. > I do not feel...we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of > the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in Congress, that > we, the lovers of Hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our > birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores, that we > should satisfy the thirst for power and control of some inflated > industrialists and politicians who hide under the guise of friends of > Hawaii, yet still keeping an eagle eye on the financial and political > pressure button of subjugation over the people in general of these > islands.John S. Whitehead, \\"The Anti-Statehood Movement and the Legacy of > Alice Kamokila Campbell\\" in The Hawaiian Journal of History, vol. 27 (1993) > ‚Äì Article on one of the few voices opposing statehood for Hawaii in 1959, > that of a prominent public and cultural figure, a descendant of Hawaiian > royalty and an heir of the James Campbell Estate. In 1947 Kamokila Campbell opened the Anti-Statehood Clearing House, where she sent \\"anti-statehood information, reports and arguments to congress.\\"September 18, 1947, Honolulu Star-Bulletin On March 29, 1949, Kamokila Campbell successfully sued the Hawaii Statehood Commission, to stop them from spending public money to lobby for statehood, invalidating a single section of the Act which created the Hawaii Statehood Commission.

Cixous aimed to establish a genre of literary writing that deviates from traditional masculine styles of writing, one which examines the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text.Showalter, Elaine.

Cixous is searching for what Isidore Isou refers to as the \\"hidden signifer\\" in language which expresses the ineffable and what cannot be expressed in structuralist language. It has been suggested by Cixous herself that more free and flowing styles of writing such as stream of consciousness, have a more \\"feminine\\" structure and tone than that of more traditional modes of writing. This theory draws on ground theory work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as 'other' in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own otherness, both within and outside their own minds, or consciousness.\\"Murfin, Ross C.\\" http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf Cixous H√©l√®ne Cixous first coined √©criture f√©minine in her essay \\"The Laugh of the Medusa\\" (1975), where she asserts \\"woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies\\" because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous' essay, a recent book titled Laughing with Medusa (2006) analyzes the collective work of Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bracha Ettinger and H√©l√®ne Cixous.Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam, Laughing with Medusa. Oxford University Press, 2006 These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as \\"the French feminists,\\" though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that \\"poststructuralist theoretical feminists\\" would be a more accurate term. Madeleine Gagnon is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women's studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group Psychanalyse et politique and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, des femmes. And when asked of her own writing she says, \\"Je suis l√† o√π √ßa parle\\" (\\"I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.\\") Jones, Ann Rosalind.

Elaine Showalter, ed. London: Virago, 1986. 249. √âcriture f√©minine places experience before language, and privileges non- linear, cyclical writing that evades \\"the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system.\\"Cixous, H√©l√®ne. \\"The Laugh of the Medusa.\\" New French Feminisms. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron, eds. New York: Schocken, 1981. 253. Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, ‚Äúthe female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes‚Äù.Barry, Peter. Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory. New York: Manchester UP, 2002. 126. Ecriture f√©minine thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.However, the phallogocentric argument has been criticised by W. A. Borody as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of ‚Äò‚Äôindeterminateness‚Äô‚Äô in Western culture. Borody claims that the \\"black and white\\" view that the masculine = determinateness and the feminine = indeterminateness contains a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a form of gender-othering it originally sought to overcome. See Wayne A. Borody (1998) pp. 3, 5 \\"Figuring the Phallogocentric Argument with Respect to the Classical Greek Philosophical Tradition.\\" Nebula: A Netzine of the Arts and Science, Vol. 13 (pp. 1-27). In the words of Rosemarie Tong, ‚ÄúCixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.‚ÄùTong, Rosemarie Putnam. Feminist Thought : A More Comprehensive Introduction. New York: Westview P, 2008.276. > Almost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about > their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their > eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their > bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, > about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries > of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright.Klages, Mary. \\"Helene > Cixous: The Laugh of the Medusa.\\" With regard to phallogocentric writing, Tong argues that \\"male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the \\"big dick\\", is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring\\" and furthermore, that \\"stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change\\". > Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the > imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the > crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that > works against us and off our backs; not yourself. Smug-faced readers, > managing editors, and big bosses don't like the true texts of women- female- > sexed texts. That kind scares them.H√©l√®ne Cixous, Summer 1976. For Cixous, √©criture f√©minine is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as James Joyce or Jean Genet.J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 93 Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous‚Äô definition of √©criture f√©minine (often termed ‚Äòwhite ink‚Äô) because of the many references she makes to the female body (‚ÄúThere is always in her at least a little of that good mother‚Äôs milk. She writes in white ink‚Äù.Klages, Mary. \\"Helene Cixous: 'The Laugh of the Medusa.) when characterizing the essence of √©criture f√©minine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists: > \\"Ecriture f√©minine, then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, > intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises > many problems.

New > York: Manchester UP, 2002.128. Irigaray and Kristeva For Luce Irigaray, women's sexual pleasure jouissance cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, \\"logical,\\" masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed the semiotic.R. Appignanesi/C. Garrattt, Postmodernism for Beginners (1995) p. 98 Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called parler femme, womanspeak)J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., p. 275 is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women's sexuality and women's language through the following analogy: women's jouissance is more multiple than men's unitary, phallic pleasure because Murfin, Ross C. http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf > \\"woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more > diffusive than its 'masculine counterpart'. That is undoubtedly the > reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to > discern the coherence.\\" Irigaray, Luce. This Sex. Irigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523. Critiques The approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically 'French' in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics.Moi, Toril, ed. French Feminist Thought. Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1987. () Nonetheless, in practice the French women's movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the 8 March; fought hard for women's right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women's rights. Further criticisms of √©criture f√©minine include what some claim is an essentialist view of the body and the consequential reliance on a feminism of 'difference' which, according to Diana Holmes, for instance, tends to \\"demonize masculinity as the repository of all that (at least from a post-'68, broadly Left perspective) is negative. It also, says Holmes in French Women's Writings, 1848-1994 (1996), would exclude much of women's writing from the feminist canon.Diana Holmes, French Women's Writings, 1848-1994 (1996) p. 228-30 Literary examples As a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of \\"√©criture f√©minine\\", very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool.See however Fr√©d√©ric Regard, L'√©criture f√©minine en Angleterre, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 2002. A. S. Byatt offers: \\"There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (langue, tongue)\\".A.

The average temperature is with rainfall. History Koƒçani at night Koƒçani in 1942 Postcard of Koƒçani, from 1930's Due to its favourable geographic location, together with excellent natural climate characteristics, Koƒçani was inhabited as early as the ancient times first by the Paionians, Meds and Thracians. Later on, in the 6th century the Slavs inhabited parts of the region. More precisely, in the 7th century members of the Slavic tribe Smolyani colonized the Koƒçani valley and built a fortification. The founders of the Slavic education, brothers Kiril and Metodij (Cyril and Methodius), stayed in the valley from the year 845 to 855 and in the Bregalnica area (Morodvis) started to preach Christianity in Slavic language. Although the settlement existed long before that, Koƒçani was first mentioned in a charter from 1337 in which Despot Jovan Oliver donated the church of St. Dimitrija to Koƒçani. Archaeological finds in the town itself have revealed remains of a settlement here in the Roman and Byzantine periods. Early in the 15th century it fell under Turkish rule. The travel chronicler Evliya Chelebi, who visited it in 1662, recorded that it had 600 households, a mosque, a mezjid, an inn and 15 handicraft stores. During the 18th and in the early 19th century, the town growth rate stagnated. It was only around 1878 that the population began to rise, at which time it had about 450 - 500 households. The town has two feudal residences in the shape of towers believed to date from the 16th - 17th century. Monuments Numerous cultural and historical monuments, from ancient times to the Middle Ages, can be found in the vicinity of Koƒçani. One of them is an archeological site of Dolno Gradishte from the late antic period, and two medieval towers at the city center. Monastery complexes in the nearby villages Morodvis and Panteley are world-famous both for their architecture and unique frescoes. Features St. George Orthodox church in Koƒçani Freedom Monument in Koƒçani The town green, especially along the river bed and banks of the Koƒçani river, is the pride of the local people.

Biography God Dethroned was formed in 1990 by singer and guitar player Henri Sattler, with Hans Leegstra (guitar) and Ard de Weerd. Sattler and Leegstra had previously been in Dysentery; Leegstra, quickly after the band formed, left the music scene altogether. They recorded a demo, Christ Hunt, in 1991, after which Marco Arends joined on bass. Their first album, The Christhunt, was released on the German label Shark. Meanwhile, Arends left (to rejoin Altar) and was replaced by Marcel Beukeveld. The Christhunt did poorly; the label had refused to feature a dissected rat on the cover and did not promote the record at all. Dethroned went on hiatus the following year, in part because Sattler's anti-Christian sympathy was not shared by all, and Sattler formed a new group called Ministry of Terror. In 1996, after that band's 1994 album Fall of Life and a supporting European tour (with Impaled Nazarene), Sattler re-formed God Dethroned with guitarist Jens van der Valk (who did not share Sattler's anti-Christian sympathies either), bassist Beef, and drummer Roel Sanders. With this lineup a deal was signed with Metal Blade, and they issued The Grand Grimoire in Europe in 1997; the album was released in the U.S. the following year, along with a re-issue of The Christhunt, which featured the original cover art, with the dissected rat. The Grand Grimorie did much better than The Christhunt did, and the band soon entered into a sort of high point. The lineup of Sattler, Van Der Valk, Beef and Sanders would record the album Bloody Blasphemy, which many fans of the band consider to be their best work to date. Successful tours and shows with bands like Marduk, Immortal, and Deicide would later follow. After Bloody Blasphemy, Sanders soon left the band and was replaced by Puerto Rican drummer Tony Laureano. Laureano played with the band up till 2003, when he received an offer to join the American death metal band Nile. He would record only one album with the band: 2001's Ravenous. A new drummer was found, Ari√´n Van Weesenbeek, and the band entered the studio at the end of 2002 to record Into the Lungs of Hell. More problems began to follow, as Beef and Jens were tired with the direction of the band and wanted to push for a more heavy and extreme sound with more anti- Christian lyrics (themes that had begun to start to fade to an extent on Ravenous), whereas Sattler wanted to keep the band at a more melodic and darker sound with lyrics focused more on darkness, horror, nihilism, and other themes. After the recording and a short amount of touring for Into the Lungs of Hell, both the bassist and guitarist left the band, and Henri Sattler had to go look out for members once again. Bassist Henk Zinger was quickly brought into the fold, and Ari√´n van Weesenbeek recommended Belgian guitarist Isaac Delahaye to the band. This lineup would finish up the remaining tour dates and would go back into the studio to record another album, 2005's The Lair of the White Worm. After touring for a little while, the band then went back into the studio and released The Toxic Touch in 2006. In January 2008, two personnel changes were made. Since Ari√´n van Weesenbeek had joined Dutch symphonic metal band Epica full-time in December 2007, he was replaced with former drummer Roel Sanders. After a writing period, Passiondale was recorded and released in early 2009. The album's concept is based on The Battle of Passchendaele during World War I. Once the album was completed, auditions were held and Susan Gerl was selected as the new guitar player. Shortly after the release Roel Sanders was asked to leave the band and Michiel Van Der Plicht was brought in. 2010 Henri Sattler made the following statement in a Metal Blade Press release: \\"We are halfway through the writing process for a new album, which we will record starting end of May. First, we'll play on the Killfest tour in the U.S. supporting Overkill together with label mates Woe of Tyrants and many other great bands. Abigail Williams' axeman Ian Jekelis will take over touring duties for Susan, with whom we parted ways last January. We will announce the name of our new shredder right before we play our first European festival in May.\\" Shortly after, guitarist Danny Tunker (Prostitute Disfigurement, Detonation) was announced as the new lead guitarist. The New God Dethroned album Under The Sign Of The Iron Cross was released through Metal Blade on November, 22nd 2010 and met rave reviews. It marked the first time God Dethroned became 'Album Of The Month' in the Netherlands' Aardschok magazine. Sattler announced that 2011 will be the last year of the band and their final show will be in December, but they performed at 70000 Tons of Metal festival in January 2012, after which they officially disbanded. Sattler announced that the band will reunite in 2015, performing at the 70,000 Tons of Metal Festival in January. While they will only be a \\"small selection of shows,\\" according to Sattler, the band does have more shows planned for 2015. But later on, God Dethroned played a lot of shows and in 2017 they even recorded a new album The World Ablaze. The World Ablaze is the third album of the band's World War I trilogy. The album got high ranks in metal charts. With lead guitarist Mike Ferguson and bass guitarist Jeroen Pomper, God Dethroned's newest album, Illuminati was released on February 7, 2020. Genre God Dethroned originally formed as a death metal band. When they reformed in 1996, they switched to blackened death metal and stayed that way until the release of Into the Lungs of Hell, when they shifted to melodic death metal. They are, however, \\"an important part of the Dutch black metal scene\\", according to The Encyclopedia of Dutch Black Metal. Their latest two albums saw a return to their original blackened death metal sound.

It functions are now under the jurisdiction of the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. History and activities The Committee on Commerce and Manufactures was established as one of the original standing committees, following adoption of a resolution proposed by James Barbour of Virginia on December 10, 1816. The committee\`s records consist of petitions and memorials referred to the committee for the whole period and committee reports and papers from 1818. With its brief existence, the records show substantial committee activity, especially regarding petitions received. In all Congresses the principle record subjects are tariffs and the regulation of shipping and revenue collection. Other subjects included the welfare of sick and disabled seamen between the 15th and 17th Congress, and harbor improvements such as lighthouses between the 16th and 18th Congress. The single most prominent subject was tariffs, particularly the protectionist Tariff of 1824 in the 18th Congress. From its beginning, the committee received petitions and memorials from various individuals or groups seeking protection for their particular industry, as well as a few from agricultural interests, such as those from various agricultural societies of Virginia, seeking less tariff protection (17th). Many memorials requesting higher duties on imported iron and products manufactured from iron were received, mainly from citizens of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, during the debate of the 1824 tariff. Prominent textile manufacturer Samuel Slater and other Rhode Island citizens also memorialized the Senate about the 1824 tariff. Other activities relating to shipping and revenue collection include registration of vessels, establishment of new collection districts and ports of entry, and collection of duties on sales at auction. The Tariff of 1824 was a pivotal issue for the committee's established existence. In December 1825, the chairman, Mahlon Dickerson of New Jersey, proposed that the committee be split into separate committees‚Äîone for commerce and one for manufactures. Dickerson, a protectionist, believed that it was \\"improper to blend two subjects so distinct from each other as Commerce and Manufactures\\" and he was supported in his proposal by fellow Senator James Lloyd of Massachusetts, a free trader, who thought that low tariff advocates on the existing committee were a distinct minority. On the other hand, Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina argued that such a division reflected narrow, sectional interests, and alternatively proposed that agriculture be added to give a single committee oversight of the Nation's economic interests. Dickerson's motion was adopted and the committee was split. Chairmen *William Hunter (F-RI) 1816-1817 *Nathan Sanford (DR-NY) 1817-1820 *Mahlon Dickerson (DR-NJ) 1820-1825 References Chapter 7.

It is named after an ancient local family the \\"de Wightwicks\\". It is on the western fringe of Wolverhampton and borders the rural South Staffordshire area that includes neighbourhoods such as Perton. Of note is Wightwick Manor, a Victorian era manor house in the arts and crafts style. The interior features extensive use of William Morris designs and is noted as one of his pioneering works. The house is the former home of the Mander family who achieved wealth through the ownership of Mander Brothers, paint and varnish manufacturers since 1773, and fame through public service and political office. Sir Geoffrey Le Mesurier Mander was the first of the Mander family to sit in the House of Commons. The house is now in the hands of the National Trust. The Mander family also owned the nearby 'Mount', seat of the Mander Baronets, which is now a hotel and conference centre with views as far as the Malvern hills, over away. Wightwick Hall is also in the area, being less than a mile via the lanes that connect the two properties. Sir Alfred Hickman owned Wightwick Hall. Nearby Elmsdale Hall was owned by the former Wolverhampton Mayor and industrialist Sir John Morris.

A trivet is an object placed between a serving dish or bowl, and a dining table, usually to protect the table from heat damage. Trivet also refers to a tripod used to elevate pots from the coals of an open fire (the word trivet itself ultimately comes from Latin tripes meaning \\"tripod\\"). Metal trivets are often tripod-like structures with three legs to support the trivet horizontally to hold the dish or pot above the table surface. These are often included with modern non-electric pressure cookers. A trivet may often contain a receptacle for a candle that can be lit to keep food warm. A three-legged design is optimal because it eliminates wobbling on uneven surfaces. Modern trivets are made from metal, wood, ceramic, fabric, silicone or cork. When roasting any meat in an oven, trivet racks - which typically fit into roasting pans - are often used to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of the roasting pan and allow the juices of the joint to drip into the roasting pan for the subsequent making of gravy. A trivet can also be made of freshly cut carrot, celery and onion. This not only raises the meat, i.e. chicken, it has the further advantage of providing a gravy-friendly liquid when the vegetables and juices are sieved at the end of cooking.

After disbanding in order to pursue other musical directions in 1994, Pestilence reunited in 2008, and was put on a \\"permanent hold\\" in July 2014. However, the band reunited once again in October 2016. To date, the band has released eight studio albums.Pestilence Summon Dark Gods on Obsideo, Metalsucks.net. 2013-10-26. Retrieved on 2013-12-07. Biography =Early career (1986‚Äì1990)= Pestilence started in the Netherlands in mid-1986 as a thrash metal band. The lineup, consisting of Patrick Mameli (guitar, vocals), Randy Meinhard (guitar), and Marco Foddis (drums), recorded two demos before gaining the attention of Roadrunner Records. After the first demo, Martin van Drunen (bass, vocals) joined them. These two demos ‚Äì Dysentery (1987) and The Penance (1987) ‚Äì are raw, sounding mostly like a cross between Possessed and Schizophrenia-era Sepultura. After signing with Roadrunner, Pestilence released their debut album, Malleus Maleficarum, in 1988, further refining their approach to thrash metal. The new material was tighter and more focused than the demos. It set a new standard of brutality and became a definition of European death/thrash metal. Meanwhile, Pestilence recruited a new guitar player, Patrick Uterwijk. In 1989, the band released their second album, Consuming Impulse, a turn toward death metal. Musically, things became heavier and more haunting. Vocally, Martin van Drunen moved away from cleaner vocals in favour of a more acidic growl. With its release, Pestilence gained international attention, and became highly regarded worldwide by death metal fans . But before a follow-up album was released, the lineup changed once again; vocalist and bassist Martin van Drunen departed to front Asphyx. =Success and breakthrough (1991‚Äì1994)= Pestilence were faced with the challenge of replacing another member once again, being now without a vocalist and bassist. For their third album Testimony of the Ancients, they enlisted bassist Tony Choy from death metal band Cynic while Patrick Mameli took over the vocal duties. A more technical and progressive approach, Testimony of the Ancients co-defined early progressive death metal alongside Piece of Time and Human musical and lyrical-wise, with \\"Land Of Tears\\" getting heavy rotation on Headbangers Ball worldwide. However, Tony Choy was never a permanent member, and ended up going back to Florida to eventually play with Atheist. In the meantime, Pestilence enlisted the talents of Jeroen Paul Thesseling. Over the years, Pestilence members were getting into other forms of music, primarily jazz fusion. The band's fourth album, Spheres was an even more complex affair, mixing jazz elements into their death metal style while also incorporating guitar synths throughout the album. Pestilence's popularity had risen with the release of each album, but unfortunately, so did tensions between the members. After a short period of time, the band unanimously decided to split up, feeling they had reached their creative climax. =Post-breakup (1995‚Äì2007)= In 1994, Roadrunner released one last CD from Pestilence: a best-of titled Mind Reflections, containing tracks from all four albums, plus the rare song \\"Hatred Within\\" (originally released on the Teutonic Invasion Part II compilation) and six unreleased live tracks recorded at the Dynamo Open Air Festival in 1992. In 1998, Displeased Records re-released the debut album Malleus Maleficarum (which was originally never officially released in Europe), and included both demo recordings from 1986 and 1987. In 2006, Metal War Productions, working with Martin van Drunen, released Chronicles of the Scourge, containing two concert recordings and one unreleased bonus track. The two concerts are Live \\"Kix Festival\\" ‚Äì Veghel, the Netherlands (June 24, 1989) and Live Bochum, Germany (November 18, 1988). A bonus \\"rehearsal disc\\" was released with the first 1000 copies. =First reunion (2008‚Äì2013)= A long period of inactivity ended in January 2008, when vocalist/guitarist Patrick Mameli told Blabbermouth.net that Pestilence were back. The reunion line-up consisted of Mameli on vocals and guitar, Tony Choy on bass and Peter Wildoer on drums. Speaking to Blabbermouth.net regarding his decision to resurrect the band, Mameli had this to say: > It's not a reunion, because I will not be playing with any of the old lineup > guys, except Tony Choy, of course so... I always stated there WILL NEVER BE > a reunion, and there won't be, since I never look back at the past and I > refuse now to play with people that are not on the same musical level as I > am. I sang on Testimony and Spheres (two albums later from Consuming > Impulse!!), so no need for Martin. This because of the above statement I > just made. Furthermore, Martin is doing other things. Good for him. So now > you have two members that were in Pestilence before and one new guy. The > reason why I bring Pestilence back to life is that people/fans keep asking > me for this. The time is right now and Mascot is giving me the opportunity > to do so. As you know, I have always been the driving force behind > Pestilence, writing all the music and so forth, so that I can state: I will > bring back Pestilence to life. More tech and way more brutal than ever > before. In 2008, Pestilence decided to write and record new music for an early 2009 release working with Danish producer Jacob Hansen. Titled Resurrection Macabre, it is their first original album in sixteen years (since 1993's Spheres). In March 2008, Patrick Uterwijk re-joined the band as second- guitarist, however he didn't play on Resurrection Macabre.Guitarist PATRICK UTERWIJK To Tour With Resurrected PESTILENCE blabbermouth.net. 2008-17-03. In October 2009, Jeroen Paul Thesseling re-joined Pestilence after fifteen years of separation from the band, replacing Tony Choy's bass position, a move that soon led to his departure from Obscura. In March 2010, Pestilence announced their first US summer tour in over 16 years which would begin at Maryland Deathfest at Sonar on May 30. The reformed Pestilence released another album entitled Doctrine in April 2011. On February 22, 2012, Patrick Mameli announced that Jeroen Paul Thesseling and Yuma van Eekelen both left Pestilence, to commit more on their main projects, Thesseling's Nufutic, and van Eekelen's Exivious. Thesseling was replaced by Stephan Fimmers (Necrophagist), and van Eekelen was replaced by Tim Yeung (Morbid Angel, Divine Heresy, All That Remains, Hate Eternal). The new two members were also included in the recording session of the seventh Pestilence album, Obsideo. =Second breakup and reunion (2014‚Äìpresent)= On July 8, 2014, vocalist/guitarist Patrick Mameli announced that Pestilence was on a \\"permanent hold\\", as he wanted to \\"concentrate fully\\" on his new project Neuromorph. On October 4, 2016, Pestilence announced on their Facebook page that they were once again active, and announced a new lineup, featuring Mameli on both guitar and vocals, Tony Choy on bass (later replaced by Tilen Hudrap), Santiago Dobles on lead guitar and Septimiu HƒÉr≈üan on drums. On February 22, 2017, the band announced via their Facebook page that a new album, titled Hadeon, was due to be released in 2017. The album's release date was later pushed back to 2018, and was finally released on March 9, 2018. On July 24, 2018, shortly before the bands North America tour was to begin, metal blog new and opinion site MetalSucks reported on a 2017 Facebook post that they alleged showed Patrick Mameli on his personal Facebook page, in response to a photo of him with blonde dreadlocks, responding to a comment that compared his look to Milli Vanilli with the statement in his native Dutch, \\"Je zegt dat ik een neger ben?\\" The site alleged that the use of \\"neger\\" translated to an American racial slur. Along with the comment, MetalSucks also alleged that the singer also \\"propagates Jewish stereotypes\\", pointing to his support of United States President Donald Trump moving the nations embassy in Israel. Many commenters on the site pointed out that the website used a Facebook translation on the post that translated it to the more offensive version, while Google Translate would return \\"black\\" or \\"negro\\". In response, the band posted a statement, reading in part, \\"PESTILENCE nor myself are in any way a political band. We do not condone or support nazism[sic] or racism in any way. Pestilence exists only to create awesome music for our listeners and fans.\\" Patrick Mameli adding, \\"On being a racist, 'for god's sake, my 'soon-to-be' wife is ASIAN, how could I be rasist?[sic]\\" On July 26, 2018, the band's entire U.S. tour was cancelled due to the article. In a post on Mameli's Facebook page, he stated, \\"Thanks to metalsucks and their followers, our US minitour has been cancelled by our U.S. promotor[sic].\\" On September 24, 2018, Pestilence announced that they were replacing Tilen Hudrap with Edward Negrea of Necrovile. The band also announced that new music, touring and festival appearances were planned for 2019. On August 1, 2019, Pestilence announced that they had signed to Agonia Records and would release their upcoming ninth studio album Exitivm in the coming months. On May 26, 2020, Pestilence announced that Septimiu HƒÉr≈üan had to leave the band due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drums for the upcoming album Exitivm, to be released in early 2021, will be performed by Michiel van der Plicht (God Dethroned and Carach Angren).

AMG independently hires engineers and contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles. The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG, which is owned by Daimler AG. AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, a higher level of performance, better handling, better stability and more extensive use of carbon fibre than their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class. AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes- Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. \\"C 63\\" as opposed to \\"C 320\\"). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3 litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the C 63 actually have 4.0L V8s. The world's first stand alone Mercedes-AMG dealership, AMG Sydney, was opened in Sydney, Australia in 2018.  History  AMG logo on a Mercedes E 63 AMG (W212) AMG was founded as a racing engine forge in 1967 under the name AMG Motorenbau und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (AMG Engine Production and Development, Ltd.) by former Mercedes-Benz engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher in Burgstall an der Murr, near Stuttgart. The letters \\"AMG\\" stand for Aufrecht, Melcher and Gro√üaspach (Aufrecht's birth town). In 1976, most of AMG moved to Affalterbach, with the racing-engine development remaining at the old location in Burgstall. At this time, Erhard Melcher ceased to be a partner, but he continued to be an employee at the Burgstall location. In 1993, with AMG having become a high-profile purveyor of modified Mercedes-Benz cars, Daimler- Benz AG and AMG signed a contract of cooperation, allowing AMG to leverage Daimler-Benz's extensive dealer network and leading to commonly developed vehicles (the first one being the Mercedes-Benz E 50 AMG, in 1993). On 1 January 1999, DaimlerChrysler AG (as it was called between 1998 and 2007) acquired 51 percent of AMG shares, and AMG was renamed to Mercedes-AMG GmbH. Racing engine development was divested and continues to exist in Burgstall under the name HWA (Aufrecht's initials). On 1 January 2005, Aufrecht sold his remaining shares to DaimlerChrysler, and since then, Mercedes-AMG GmbH has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler AG. = Development of the product range = AMG Five Spoke Road Wheel 8JX16 Version 1 AMG started off by designing and testing racing engines. It expanded its business into building custom road cars based upon standard Mercedes cars. AMG initially produced a range of unofficial upgrade and accessories packages mainly for the Mercedes- Benz R107 and C107 (1971‚Äì1989 SL roadster),Hall, Jim. \\"Rhapsody in Red: 500SL AMG\\" Motor Trend Magazine, October, 1983. Mercedes-Benz W116 (1972‚Äì1980 S-class), Mercedes-Benz W123 (1976‚Äì1985 E-class), Mercedes-Benz W124 (1984‚Äì1997 E-class), Mercedes-Benz W126 (1979‚Äì1992 S-class), Mercedes-Benz R129 (1989‚Äì2001 SL roadster), and Mercedes-Benz W201 (1990‚Äì1993 C-class) models. During the early 1980s and up until 1990, AMG offered a variety of engine performance packages, alloy wheels and styling products as an entirely independent company from Daimler-Benz. In 1990, AMG signed a co-operation agreement with Daimler-Benz, and AMG options and cars were then offered in Mercedes-Benz showrooms; in 1999 Daimler AG, then known as DaimlerChrysler AG, bought the controlling share of AMG and made them part of the official Mercedes-Benz line-up. Typical AMG performance enhancements, which the buyer could custom order, included increased engine displacements (5.2 litre, 5.4 litre), performance top ends with port and polished heads and intake, lightened valve train, and more aggressive cams. The DOHC 32V engine had also just been developed and was the pinnacle of AMG performance. A Getrag five- speed manual transmission could be ordered from AMG, and Mercedes had not offered a manual transmission V8 since the early 1970s. The performance wheels offered during the same period were 15-inch or 16-inch ATS AMG Five Spoke Road Wheels, commonly referred to as Pentas. Penta was actually a UK-based company that supplemented the high demand for the AMG wheel at the time with a replica and only a very slight styling difference, but they were not made or endorsed by AMG. The genuine AMG wheels were often coupled with an AMG performance suspension package that included uprated and lowered springs, and re-valved shock absorbers. Another popular cosmetic upgrade were the AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle front spoilers, to an aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes. Other options included Recaro seats, smaller diameter steering wheels, instrument clusters, chrome delete option (all brightworks colour-coded or painted satin black), refrigerators, shift knobs, hi-fi stereo systems, custom upholstery and enhanced interior wood packages. The release of the AMG Hammer sedan in 1986, based on the W124 E-Class, took AMG's performance modifications for a fast midsized sedan to a new level. AMG made the world's fastest passenger sedan at the time, nicknamed the Hammer,\\"AMG's Hammer\\" Auto Week, June 23, 1986. by squeezing Mercedes 5.6-litre V8 tuned by AMG to 360 hp into a midsized sedan. It was very aggressive for the era, with 32-valve cylinder heads and twin camshafts, and said to be faster than the Lamborghini Countach from 60 to 120 mph.Setright, LJK. \\"Firebrand: AMG Hammer Sedan\\" Car Magazine, December, 1986. Pp.149-155 Later models were even more powerful and introduced the 17-inch AMG Aero 1 Hammer wheels. 1986 was also the year Mercedes introduced the 560 M117 engine. This provided yet another opportunity for customers to order the largest AMG displacement available at the time, the 6L 100 mm bore SOHC or DOHC engines available for both the W126 coupe and sedans. Through the early 2000s, AMG focused principally on supercharged V8 and V6 engines, but the company officially abandoned this technology in 2006 with the introduction of the naturally aspirated 6.2 L M156 V8. On 16 January 2006, Mercedes-AMG Chairman Volker Mornhinweg told AutoWeek that the company would use turbocharging for higher output rather than supercharging. For 2011, AMG released the M157 5.5L biturbo V8, which has supplanted the M156 in its full-sized cars such as the S-Class and CL-Class (and is trickling down to the CLS, E-Class and ML-class). In 2012, Mercedes- AMG Chairman Olla Kallenius said that Mercedes-AMG will not produce diesel engines to compete with BMW's tri-turbo diesels (BMW M Performance range). Mercedes AMG DTM car (2003) Although there were some AMG models in the 1980s with manual transmissions, almost all recent models have used automatics (5G-Tronic and later 7G-Tronic with Speedshift), in contrast to BMW M, which used manuals and recently semi-automatic transmissions (the current type being a dual clutch transmission). Starting in 2009, however, AMG began adopting the seven-speed AMG SpeedShift MCT automatic transmission. Although these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, Mercedes-AMG has a considerably different philosophy than BMW M. Compared to BMW M, Mercedes-AMG is \\"less narrow in its sporting focus, yet still combining sledgehammer performance with relaxed handling, cultured comfort, and practicality\\". While founders Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher had emphasized proper racing cars, Mercedes-AMG had diverged considerably from this philosophy in recent years, with their offerings being well known for straight-line acceleration but poor handling dynamics. However, current Mercedes-AMG chairman Volker Mornhinweg has urged the division to return to its roots of building sports cars. = Motor racing = AMG 300 SEL 6.8, \\"Red Sow\\" (1971) In the late 1960s and early 1970s, AMG entered the big Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 V8 saloon, affectionately named the \\"Red Sow\\", in the 1971 Spa 24 Hours, and the European Touring Car Championship. AMG and Mercedes worked together on Mercedes-Benz W201 cars for the 1988 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM, German Touring Car Championship). AMG was made the official partner. When DaimlerChrysler acquired a majority share of AMG in 1999, the motor racing department was divested into HWA AG. Their first car was the ill-fated Mercedes-Benz CLR. Since 2000, HWA builds and runs the cars for Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), as well as the M271 engine tuned for use in Formula 3. In 2000, an extensively modified one-off Mercedes-Benz AMG CLK 55 was built by the AMG Factory as a purpose built race car to compete in the 2001 Targa Tasmania 7 day road race. Mick Doohan was the works Mercedes-Benz AMG driver. AMG engine display at the Pagani factory Six successive lightly modified Mercedes-Benz AMG models (including, most recently, a C190 GT R) have acted as the safety cars for the FIA Formula One World Championship. Since 2010, the SLS AMG GT3 and the AMG GT3 has been competing in GT competitions around the world, such as the FIA GT3 European Championship, Blancpain Endurance Series, Blancpain Sprint Series, VLN, 24 Hours of Nurburgring, British GT Championship, Super GT, Australian GT Championship, Bathurst 12 Hour, Dubai 24 Hour, Macau GT Cup and Pirelli World Challenge. In late 2011, after the end of the Formula One season, Mercedes GP Petronas announced that it would be using the AMG branding for its F1 efforts, changing its name to Mercedes AMG Petronas for the 2012 season onwards. Three AMG E-Class V8 Supercars competed in the Australian Supercars Championship from 2013 to 2015, operated by Erebus Motorsport under the AMG Customer Sports Program. = Relationship with Pagani = AMG also provides engines for the Zonda and Huayra cars. The M297 7,291 cc displacement V12 engines were originally used in the 1995 SL 73 AMG. It is the largest displacement naturally aspirated engine provided by AMG and is now exclusively used by Pagani. = Relationship with Aston Martin = On July 25, 2013, Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd and Daimler AG announced moves towards a technical partnership with Mercedes-AMG GmbH. The deal will see Aston Martin access significant Mercedes-AMG GmbH and Mercedes-Benz Cars' resources, allowing the development of bespoke V8 powertrains and the use of certain components of electric/electronic architecture. Daimler AG now owns a stake of 5% of non- voting shares in Aston Martin, joining existing shareholders Investment DAR, Adeem Investment and Investindustrial. The technical partnership will support Aston Martin's launch of a new generation of models and newly developed bespoke V8 powertrains.  Current AMG models  AMG carbon fibre engine cover All AMG engines - with the exception of the \\"35\\" M260 2.0 L Inline-4 Turbo and \\"43\\" M276 3.0 L V6 Bi-Turbo engine, as well as various other \\"43\\" and \\"53\\" models using the new M256 inline 6 engine - are hand built using a \\"one man, one engine\\" philosophy at the current AMG plant in Affalterbach, Germany. To signify this, each AMG engine builder stamps the engines they produce with an engraved plaque depicting their signature. According to Mercedes-Benz, there are only about 50 AMG engine builders. As part of the official Mercedes product line, the AMG models are sold side-by-side with regular production models, unlike those offered by other Mercedes tuning firms such as Brabus.

This allows it to produce a claimed 621 horsepower and of torque. \\"65\\" models used a 5-speed automatic transmission for a long time, as the newer 7G-Tronic wasn't able to handle the torque from the V12 engines. This was changed with the introduction of 2012 SL 65 AMG, which uses the same AMG SpeedShift MCT transmission as the rest of the AMG line-up. Coinciding with the facelift of the CL-Class for the 2011 model year, the 2011 CL 65 AMG had an enhanced engine. AMG redesigned the exhaust gas turbochargers and added new engine electronics. It produced 621 horsepower, pushing the car from in 4.2 seconds (0.2 seconds faster than the 2011 CL 63), with an electronically limited top speed of . The update also improved fuel economy and reduced carbon emissions by 3.5% over the outgoing model. = \\"63\\" M157 5.5 L V8 Bi-Turbo = The models listed below were powered by the M157 variant of the Mercedes-Benz M278 engine. * Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 (W218) * Mercedes-AMG E 63 (W212) * Mercedes-AMG G 63 (W463) * Mercedes-AMG GL 63 (X166 pre-facelift) * Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 (W166 facelift) * Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 (X166 facelift) * Mercedes-AMG M 63 (W166 pre-facelift) * Mercedes-AMG S 63 (W222 pre-facelift) E 63 AMG 4MATIC T Mercedes-Benz CLS 63 AMG Rumoured in 2009 and confirmed in 2010, AMG developed the M157, a 5.5-litre V8 with direct fuel injection and twin turbochargers. Power is rated at up to at 5,250-5,750rpm with a peak torque of made between 2,000rpm and 4,500rpm (the amount of power and torque depends on model, but these are the maximum ratings). Both engines are mated to Mercedes-Benz's 7-speed MCT transmission. Unlike the M156 naturally aspirated 6.2 L V8, which was developed entirely within AMG, the M157 is based upon the M278 used in the regular Mercedes-Benz S-Class and CL-Class. The M157 boasts 25% better fuel economy (10.5 litres per 100 kilometres versus 14.4 L/100 km in the European driving cycle) over the M156, meaning it avoids the US Gas Guzzler Tax for the first time ever, despite having up to 47 horsepower more. The M157's increased torque from both the regular version and performance package means the engine can be shifted into a taller gear sooner, keeping engine revs and fuel consumption to a minimum. The new M157 has an engine start/stop mode and is lightweight at 204 kg. The M157 is said to be ideal for powering full-size sedans such as the S-Class, but the older M156 remains in production, as its more precise throttle response is still well suited to smaller sportier models (the C-Class), until the 2015 model arrives, which is powered by a 4.0 liter V8. 5.5 L V8 BiTurbo models carry the \\"63\\" model designation, shared with the 6.2L V8 models. Visually, the 2011 S 63 AMG is differentiated from the 2010 model (itself face-lifted over the 2009 S 63) by the more angular design of the chromed dual exhaust tips, which also sport embossed AMG logos, as well as new forged wheels. For the CL 63 AMG, the new M157 engine coincides with the facelift of the CL-Class for the 2011 model year. Despite common belief, 65 AMG models are typically faster than their 63 AMG counterparts. An S 63 AMG accelerates faster and handles better than an S 65 AMG (due to 4-wheel drive and decreased weight), and an SL 63 AMG accelerates faster than an SL 65 AMG due to decreased torque, lower weight, and better balance by use of the V8. Since 2013, AMG models with the S-Model package feature all-wheel drive, which allows for better handling and better acceleration. The Mercedes-Benz CLS 63 AMG S has been tested to accelerate to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds, with a quarter mile time of 11.6 seconds. This made it the quickest production sedan at the time.

Powertrain consists of AMG Speedshift 5-speed automatic transmission mated to an AMG 3.2-litre V6 Kompressor engine with an output of 260 kW/349 hp and at 4,400 rpm. The engine is a special version of the 3.2 L (3199 cc) M112 E32, fitted with a helical twin-screw supercharger and water-to-air intercooler. The supercharger was developed in conjunction with IHI and features Teflon-coated rotors producing overall boost of 14.5 psi (1 bar). Compared to the standard M112 engine, the AMG version also has a new crankshaft, new connecting rods and pistons, an oil pump with a 70-percent increased capacity, lightweight camshafts, and harder valve springs for a redline of 6200 rpm, an increase of 200 rpm. While rival BMW M developed the SMG II semi-automatic for the BMW M3, the C 32 and SLK 32 have a 5-speed automatic transmission's \\"Speedshift\\" system, which now has quicker response (up to 35 percent) to accelerator and shift selector movements. The C 32 had a smaller engine than its predecessors, the C 36 AMG with the M104 3.6L I6 engine, and the C 43 AMG powered by the M113 4.3L V8 engine.

This model was nicknamed the \\"Hammer\\" after the original 1986 AMG Hammer (a W124 E-Class sedan with an AMG-tuned 360 hp 5.6-litre V8). The 2003 E 55 AMG could do 0‚Äì60 mph in 4.4 seconds. The main engine is a 5.4 L V8 engine This engine comes in two configurations. * The first configuration is a naturally aspirated V8 with that is used in the C 55 AMG, CLK 55 AMG, E 55 AMG (1999-2002), SLK 55 AMG, and ML 55 AMG. The C 43 AMG (model years 1998‚Äì2000) was powered by a naturally aspirated V8 engine from the M113 family, but at a reduced displacement of 4.3L, hence the '43' designation. * The other configuration is a similar unit but with a highly efficient Lysholm type twin screw supercharger. manufactured by Eaton, is in the rest of the AMG 55 models, which are typically midsized or larger vehicles. The published output according to Mercedes varies from to and to , depending on various methods of power measurements and different ECU programming for national legislations. For instance, the E 55 AMG's engine was at the low end, nonetheless it was still Mercedes-Benz's fastest sedan at the time, while the SL55 AMG's engine had the top output. Mercedes has claimed that a more restrictive exhaust system was responsible for cutting output on the E 55 AMG, however some enthusiasts have managed to bump up horsepower to 505 on the E 55 by incorporating some parts from the SL 55. The supercharged 5.4 L 24 valve V8 engine was mated to the Speedshift 5-speed automatic transmission, which has a torque capacity of , as the newer 7G-Tronic introduced in 2003 is limited to , not enough to handle the torque from the supercharged V8. The V8 S 55 AMG had comparable output to the V12-powered S600 throughout their production. The S 55 AMG (2001‚Äì02) was outfitted with a 5.4 L 354 hp (264 kW) V8 motor while the later versions (2003‚Äì06) sported the same motor, but supercharged to a rated 493 hp (368 kW). The S600 (2001‚Äì02) was outfitted with a 5.8L 362 hp (270 kW) V12 engine while the later versions (2003‚Äì06) sported a twin-turbocharged (or Bi-Turbo) 493 hp (368 kW) 5.5L V12. The justification for having two models with the same power is that the S 55 AMG is sportier and more responsive, while the costlier S600 is more luxurious with a smoother ride. AMG phased out both the naturally aspirated and supercharged 5.4 L engines in favor of the new M156 V8 beginning in 2006, which was paired with 7G-Tronic. However, some enthusiasts were disappointed because the M156 produces less torque than the M113K (which is supercharged).

These were produced in limited quantities for one month and only offered through AMG to select customers in Europe and Asia, purportedly state leaders. The CL 63 AMG was the rarest C215 CL of all, and just 26 examples were built in November 2001 (51 plate), with some UK being and one for France registered in March 2002. These had a base price of ¬£110,000 (~US$200,000).http://www.supercars.net/garages/marcusmv3/126v2.html The G 63 AMG was the rarest W463 of all with just 5 examples built in September 2002 and sold in Germany at over ‚Ç¨250,000 each. These are powered by a naturally aspirated 6.3L V12 producing . This engine is based on the M137 5.8L V12 used in the S 600 and CL 600, but the AMG variants have a larger displacement, a new management system, a new crank case and cooling system, weight-optimized pistons, and a new camshaft with greater valve lift and modified valves. of torque are available between 2500‚Äì5800rpm with a peak of at 4400 rpm while horsepower grows by almost 80 over the 5.8L V12. It is mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2001 S 63 AMG V12 had 100 hp more than the 2001 S 55 AMG, and was a few tenths faster. = \\"60\\", \\"73\\", \\"70\\", \\"55\\" = The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class (R129) had several AMG variants during its production run from 1989 to 2001. The SL 60 AMG was the most numerous of these rare cars. Sold from 1993 to 1998, it used a 6.0 litre V8 engine producing at 5500 rpm.Automobil Revue, catalogue edition 1995, p. 380. AMG claimed a 0‚Äì62 mph (100 km/h) speed of 5.6 seconds. Its top speed was limited to , but with the limiter removed, it was capable of approximately . AMG later unofficially conceded that 0‚Äì60 mph,(0‚Äì97 km/h) was more like 5.0 seconds and the engine produced between 405‚Äì410 bhp. Extremely rare was the SL 73 AMG, sold through Mercedes-AMG in 1995, and offering the most powerful V12 engine ever put into an SL up to that time. After a brief hiatus, the SL 73 was offered again from 1998 to 2001. The same 7.3 L V12 was later used by Pagani in the Zonda. Even rarer is the SL 70 AMG (7.0 L (7055 cc) V12 engine). The SL 55 AMG was sold in the R129 bodystyle from 1998 to 2001 in limited numbers (5.4L V8, at 5500 rpm). It was the predecessor of the production R230 SL 55 AMG sold later, albeit was normally aspirated in the R129 and not supercharged as in its R230 successor. = \\"63\\" M156 6.2 L V8 = The \\"63\\" M156 is currently in production in the C 63 AMG, and tuned as the M159 in the SLS AMG, although there were many models that were previously in production. This naturally aspirated V8 will also be used to replace most of the \\"55\\" models. The published output according to Mercedes varies from 457 PS (336 kW; 451 hp) on the C 63 AMG, to 525 PS (386 kW; 518 hp) on the C/CLK/R/ML/GL/S/SL/CL/E 63 AMG. The 2008 S 63/CL 63/SL 63s that used the M156 engine at 518 horsepower edged out that of the S600/CL600/SL600, the latter powered by the 510 horsepower 5.5-liter twin- turbo V12, while also having a higher redline. However, the S600/CL600/SL600 are more expensive and have more torque at . The S 63/CL 63/SL 63 however do have quicker acceleration times than their S600/CL600/SL600 counterparts and are the fastest in the lineup in 2014, due to the added weight and torque of the 65s, thus decreasing the 0-60 times and the handling limits. Compared to the \\"55\\" supercharged 5.4 L V8 engine‚Äîwhich was restricted to the Speedshift 5G-Tronic five-speed automatic transmission, as it had a torque capacity of ‚Äîthe reduced torque of the \\"63\\" M156 6.2L V8 means it can be mated with the more efficient 7G-Tronic, which can withstand a limit of . Despite the reduction in torque, the increased horsepower and more efficient transmission enables the \\"63\\" models to match or surpass the acceleration of the \\"55\\" models. Most of the M156-engined models used the 7G-Tronic automatic transmission, however the more recent 2009 SL 63, 2010 E 63, and 2012 C 63 use the 7-speed MCT transmission. * Previous M156 Models ** 2007‚Äì2010 S 63 AMG ** 2006‚Äì2010 CL 63 AMG ** 2007‚Äì2011 ML 63 AMG ** 2007 R 63 AMG ** 2006‚Äì2009 CLK 63 AMG (introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show) (used as Safety Car for the 2006 and 2007 F1 World Championship) ** 2007‚Äì2011 CLS 63 AMG (introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show) ** 2007‚Äì2009 E 63 AMG (Sedan and Wagon) ** 2009‚Äì2012 SL 63 AMG ** 2010‚Äì2012 E 63 AMG (Sedan and Wagon) = Black Series = * SLK 55 AMG Black Series * CLK 63 AMG Black Series * SL 65 AMG Black Series * C 63 AMG Black Series * SLS AMG Black Series * AMG GT Black Series The AMG Performance Studio in Affalterbach is responsible for the upgrades that make an AMG into an AMG Black Series model. The Black Series treatment is only available on 2 door vehicles, which includes weight reduction, bucket seats, exterior alterations, interior alterations, higher power, greater traction, handling, and significantly greater overall performance. Black Series models are known as street legal race cars. The SLS AMG Black Series was tested by Motor Trend to have a 0-60 time of 3.2 seconds, and a quarter mile time of 11.1 seconds at 129.8 mph. The SLS AMG Black Series \\"demolished\\" the Motor Trend figure eight in just 23.1 seconds, beating the McLaren MP4-12C, Ferrari 458 Italia, Audi R8 V10 Plus, and the SRT Viper. The SLS AMG Black Series is currently the 22nd fastest car to lap the N√ºrburgring. The SLS AMG Black Series had the same 1:19 time as the Lamborghini Murci√©lago LP670-4 SuperVeloce, the Ferrari Enzo, and beat the Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4, Porsche 997 GT2, and Nissan GT-R around the Top Gear test track.List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times = Electric Drive = In 2013, Mercedes-AMG announced the SLS AMG Coupe Electric Drive, which was to be the first zero emissions vehicle from AMG. The vehicle used technology derived from Formula 1, and was the fastest electric car.

The name Tettenhall is probably derived from \\"Teotta's Halh\\", Teotta being a person's name and Halh being a sheltered position. Tettenhall became part of Wolverhampton in 1966, along with Bilston, Wednesfield and parts of Willenhall, Coseley and Sedgley. History The Battle of Tettenhall in 910 was the turning point in the battle against the Danish Viking invaders by the united forces of Edward the Elder of Wessex and Ealdorman √Üthelred of Mercia.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"United Kingdom: the reconquest of the Danelaw\\" It saw the crushing defeat of the last of the large Danish Viking armies to ravage England, including the deaths of the Danish Kings, Eowils and Healfdan. In more recent times, the north part of the village became known as \\"Danescourt\\". The original \\"Teotta's Halh\\" was likely situated in the sheltered area below the ridge where the church stands. This area, around Lower Green, was the original inhabited area of Tettenhall. In early English (Anglo-Saxon) times, as the place name evidence tells us, there were many cleared woodland areas - areas where field and settlement would have been commonplace. These can be seen today by the place name ending \\"ley\\", from early English \\"lƒìah\\", meaning woodland clearing; Wrottesley being one such example in the local area. Where most of the land was wooded, below the ridge ran, as it does today, the river Smestow - though at this time, it was a larger stream than it is today, running through extensive marshy ground. St Michael and All Angels Church, Tettenhall Tettenhall has an old parish church, St Michael and All Angels, located at the base of the ridge, leading off Lower Green. An exact founding date for it is not known, though records of a fourteenth-century dispute over village land tell us that the church had been founded during the reign of King Edgar - some point between 959 and 975 AD.Hancock, Geoffrey, A Tettenhall History (1991) The Domesday Book of 1086 informs us that before the Norman conquest, Tettenhall was held by three Englishmen - Hunta, Wulfstan, and Godwin. Of course, as with the majority of England, post-conquest, William the Conqueror gave the land to his followers. There is a variety of pear known as 'Tettenhall Dick', named after Tettenhall, originally found in the hamlet of Perton and dating to earlier than the 18th century.\\"Orchards, Trees & Orchard Produce - Staffordshire\\" at England in Particular These small, dry pears are traditionally used for the making of perry. The Bees & Trees charity began a scheme to plant 2,000 Tettenhall Dick trees across the Midlands in a bid to save them, as very few of them existed any more. These trees were grafted from existing Tettenhall Dick trees, and the scheme has proven to be a success, with trees being planted in a variety of different locations. The variety is now part of the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale. The original route of the London to Holyhead road ran through Tettenhall, though on a different course from the current A41 Tettenhall Road. The road, when heading north east from Wolverhampton, ran behind the shops at Newbridge, on bridges over the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal (when built in 1772) and the river Smestow, then across to Old Hill, where a steep climb was had for any carriages on route. The road then cut across Upper Green, swayed left into Wrottesley Road as far as Woodthorne Road, and then continuing on as the present Wergs Road.Yates's map of 1776 This route, because of the problems associated with carriages traversing the steep Old Hill, was looked at in the early 19th century by the Wolverhampton Trust and Thomas Telford, with a view to engineering a new route - either around, under, or through the ridge. Due to a dispute, Thomas Telford dropped out of the plans, leaving the Wolverhampton Trust to go it alone. The preferred method was a cutting through the ridge, with the course of the road sloping up on a gradual gradient from near the Newbridge area, cutting through and rising above Lower Green, before the direct cutting through the ridge to come out next to Upper Green. The spoil from the cutting through the ridge is what was used to create the incline of the road. Work was completed in 1823. Tettenhall today The Swan Hotel, Lower Street, Tettenhall Tettenhall is one of the few places in England to have two village greens. Tettenhall Upper Green is situated on high ground near the edge of a ridge that runs in a broadly east-west direction, from Aldersley to Perton. The Upper Green has a large paddling pool, an extensive open grass area, a cricket pitch, practice nets and the Wolverhampton Cricket Club Ground, where W. G. Grace visited and played. The area is common land that was donated by the Swindley family to the people of the parish. A clock tower, built in 1912 by the local Swindley family and donated to the parish to celebrate the coronation of King George V, is a key landmark in Upper Green. Tettenhall Lower Green is at the bottom of The Rock, near St. Michael and All Angels Church. It is a sloping grassy area that is popular for sledging on snowy winter days. The A41 road runs through the village green as a single-carriageway road. Tettenhall was previously an Urban District in its own right, until most areas became part of the Borough of Wolverhampton in 1966, with some areas of the district being placed within the present South Staffordshire district. Despite the relatively close proximity to Wolverhampton's city centre, Tettenhall retains its rural village character and a strong sense of identity among its residents. The village has tried to gain independence from Wolverhampton Council and has made plans to return to a parish council but this has no longer been pursued. Two electoral wards of Wolverhampton City Council cover Tettenhall; Tettenhall Regis (the northern part) and Tettenhall Wightwick (the southern part). Television presenter Mark Speight, who died in 2008, was from Tettenhall. His ashes are interred in the parish churchyard. Education Tettenhall has its own private school Tettenhall College, which is based in Tettenhall Towers, the former home of the Thorneycroft family. The King's C.E. School, formerly Regis Secondary School, is a voluntary aided Church of England school for 11- to 19-year-olds, in Tettenhall. As part of the BSF programme, the school was refurbished and now incorporates Tettenhall Wood Special School onto its site. Christ Church Infants and Juniors are linked to the church of the same name, situated in Tettenhall Wood. St Michael's CofE School and Woodthorne Primary School are also located here. Transport Tettenhall has strong connections to Wolverhampton and Dudley with buses running every 9 minutes in the week and on weekends only to drop to a 20 minute frequency on evenings. There are also buses to Compton and Telford. Tettenhall also was served by three railway stations which were on the former Wombourne Branch Line. The stations that served Tettenhall were Dunstall Park, Tettenhall and Compton Halt. The nearest railway station to the village is Wolverhampton and Bilbrook. There has been talks about opening a new station on the edge of Tettenhall on the Shrewsbury- Wolverhampton Line. The Tettenhall Transport Heritage Centre is the first transport museum in the City of Wolverhampton and is found in Tettenhall. References Further reading * Geoffrey Hancock. A Tettenhall History.

The basic requirements to obtain the license and the privileges it confers are agreed internationally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However the actual implementation varies quite widely from country to country. According to ICAO, to be eligible for a commercial pilot license, the applicant must; * be able to read, speak, write, and understand English * already hold a private pilot license * have received training in the areas of a commercial pilot * successfully complete the relevant written exams. The JAA has several approved courses leading to the issue of a JAA commercial pilot's license with an instrument rating without first obtaining a private pilot's license. Upon completing those prerequisites the applicant will then receive an exam from the governing aviation body that consists of an oral and practical flight test from an examiner. Applicants for a CPL (aeroplanes) must also have completed a solo cross-country flight of at least 300 nm with full- stop landings at two airfields other than the pilot's airfield of origin. Different types of commercial pilot certificates or licenses are issued for the major categories of aircraft: airplanes, airships, balloons, gliders, gyroplanes and helicopters. As noted below, depending on the issuing jurisdiction these may all be on the same document. A certificate/license will contain a number of sub-qualifications or ratings. These specify in more detail the actual privileges of the license, including the types of aircraft that can be flown (single-engine or multiengine), whether flight under instrument flight rules is allowed (instrument rating), and whether instructing and examining of trainee pilots can be done (instructor or examiner rating). It may be possible to show these ratings at different levels. Some JAA states (but not the United States) restrict the use of the title \\"Captain\\" to CPL holders and above.

It was translated from Arabic into English in 1992 by Denys Johnson-Davies and published by Doubleday. Plot summary Ibn Fattouma, more commonly known by his birth name Qindil Muhammad al-Innabi, is a Muslim man disillusioned by the corruption in his home city. When he asks his teacher why a land whose people obey the tenets of Islam suffers so, Qindil is told that the answer he seeks lies far away from the city, in the land of Gebel; the land of perfection. The teacher encourages Ibn Fattouma to seek the land of Gebel, where such problems have been solved. The teacher attempted to journey there himself, but civil war in neighboring lands and the demands of family ultimately prevented him from completing the journey. Further complicating Qindil's impending expedition, no documents exist about the land and no one is known to have returned from Gebel. Qindil is determined to embark on the journey, for he feels betrayed by his mother, who remarried, and his lover, who was stolen by the sultan. He gives his farewells to his family and proceeds on a caravan out of his home city to the land of Mashriq. In this sexually libertine society, the women and men do not marry; rather, they share each other's partners. The religion of Mashriq is primitive and pagan; the moon is worshiped as a god. Qindil questions the land's customs, but he soon acculturates to their ways. He settles in Mashriq with a woman named Arousa and they have five children. Because of Qindil's insistence upon teaching his eldest son Islam, he is exiled from Mashriq and prohibited from seeing Arousa or their children again. Qindil then travels to the land of Ha√Øra. The invasion of Mashriq by militaristic Ha√Øra further separates Qindil from his family, and when the annexation of Mashriq is finished, Arousa is brought to Ha√Øra as a slave, who is then bought by Qindil. The chamberlain of the god-king of Ha√Øra desires Arousa as a wife and arranges Qindil to be jailed. Twenty years pass in Ha√Øra in jail before the god-king is overthrown, and the chamberlain, who is also later jailed, tells Qindil to look in the neighboring land of Halba for Arousa and children. In Halba, the freedom of the individual is the most important value. All religions peacefully coexist and Halba openly encourages freedom of inquiry. The Halbans are also aggressive promoters of their philosophy of life in other nations; preparations are underway as Qindil arrives for a war with neighboring Aman. There, Qindil meets and marries Samia, an intellectual Muslim pediatrician in Halba's hospital. Qindil reunites with Arousa, who thought he was lost and had since married a Buddhist man. With Samia's reluctant approval, Qindil decides to continue his journey before war makes such travel impossible. In the land of Aman, justice is held as the most important value. To maintain order, he leaves just as Aman and Halba prepare to fight. His next stop, the land of Ghuroub, finds Qindil questioned to the depths of his being. Does he earnestly desire to go to Gebel, and why? Qindil states as he has many times before that he seeks to learn Gebel's secret of perfection in life and share it with the people of his homeland. He and the other seekers of Gebel are driven from Ghuroub by an invading army from Aman, and after months of travel, they sight Gebel itself from a mountain peak. As Qindil descends to continue his journey, the story ends leaving the reader to surmise whether or not he reached the city. Setting The setting of the story is not clearly spatial or temporal; the journey moves through a space that can represent the historical Middle East, an analogical space of different periods of history or a simply imaginary space. It can be viewed as some combination of these spaces. The story may be allegorical for the rise of Human Civilization. Qindil starts his adventure from his homeland, the Dar al- Islam, which practices traditional, familiar Islamic values but imperfectly, and with a great deal of corruption. When Qindil sets out, the first land he visits is the Land of Mashriq. Mashriq is the land of the sunrise, and may represent early civilization; particularly that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Mashriq employs a very basic religion based on worship of the moon, and incorporates primal, tribal, values representative of early human development. Haira may thus represent the rise of human civilization and the chaos that accompanied it. Haira means ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù in Arabic and features the rule of a divine king and frequent wars. Its values seem to reflect those of absolutism; though without any clear historical period in mind. Qindil travels to the Halba following Haira, Halba is the land of freedom. Halba may represent Western civilization, and includes democracy, wealth, and sophistication. Halba eventually conquers both Mashriq and Haira; plausibly mirroring the historical rise of the West. Qindil then travels to Aman; the land of security and total justice. Aman employs communism and is engaged with a struggle for influence against Halba; an interesting parallel to the time the book was written in 1983. Finally Qindil stops at Ghuroub; the land of the sunset. Ghuroub is interesting, as it has no obvious parallel in the real world. It is a transitory place, where people train to go forth to the land of Gebel. Qindil then journeys to the Land of Gebel, which is at the top of a mountain. Gebel symbolizes heaven on Earth. No man has ever returned from Gebel, the land of perfect society. Some of the places mentioned in the book, such as Gebel, Haira and Mashriq were names of historical kingdoms in the Classical and Medieval Middle East. They are not just analogies but also references to the real, if much mythologised past. Analysis Mahfouz turned away from Western literature and looked to Arabic modes for narrative inspiration. Medieval Arabic influence was shown in the story's episodic style with little interest in a central plot. Mahfouz used the Journey of Ibn Battuta as an inspiration but his character, Ibn Fattouma travels through time, not space. Each land fits into the evolution of civilization. The Journey is an allegory for Mahfouz's search for a perfect socio-political system. Each land was named after its time in the history of man; Mashriq was sunrise, Haira bewilderment, Halba arena, Aman security, Ghuroub sunset, and Gebel mountain. This story ends in the present as it is fitting that it does not continue into the future. Mahfouz shows the progression of man from undeveloped to modern, developed civilizations. The land of Mashriq (or Sunrise in the original text) represents the origin of human society. A tribal land, it has an animist religion and the people live comparatively simply to Qindil's homeland. Next in the progression is the land of Haira (or Bewilderment), a land representing the transition to absolute monarchies in the course of human civilization. Haira incites a war against Mashriq, triumphs and promptly takes over it, showing the spread of monarchy as well as the spread of these empires. Next is Halba (or Arena), a land of freedom, where all religions are tolerated and freedom of speech is guaranteed and practice. However, it is plagued by crime. The democracy engages in war against Halba, succeeds, and takes over Haira, like the revolutions and change to democracy in much of the world in the 18th to 20th centuries. Next is Aman (or Security), a communist society in which equality is enforced and the government controls all aspects of society. The president, however, has absolute power and has a distinct social and monetary advantage over the commoners. A parallel in the world would be the Soviet Union. The land engages in a war with Halba and takes over Ghuroub out of fear of Halba taking it, much like the influence America and the Soviet Union had over other countries in the Cold War of recent times. The victor is left ambiguous, just as the victor of the Cold War was unknown in 1983, when the novel was written. Last is the land of Gebel (or Mountain); a utopia. It represents the climax of human society and the workings of the society are left unknown, just as the workings of a utopia today are unknown to humanity. Characters Qindil Muhammad al-Innabi - The narrator and the main protagonist, he is the son of an eighty-year-old man, Muhammad al-Innabi, who fell in love with a seventeen-year-old girl, Fattouma al-Azhari. He was given the name 'Ibn Fattouma' i.e. 'son of Fattouma'. Arousa - The girl that Qindil falls in love with in the Land of Mashriq but the ways of the land are different and he can't marry (or purchase) her outright. But a union, of sorts, is established and Qindil settles down in the land, staying for years and fathering her children. Driven to bring his son up on the principles of Islam, he runs afoul of local customs and is arrested and deported. They are united momentarily after Mashriq is conquered are separated when Qindil is falsely arrested. Arousa then marries a Buddhist and sees Qindil in the Land of Halba in a jewelry shop that Qindil is working in. Ham - Qindil's mentor throughout the land of Haira, he is the owner of the inn for foreign travelers. Fam - Qindil's mentor throughout the land of Mashriq, he is the owner of the inn for foreign travelers. Halima Adlial-Tantawi - She is a young woman in Qindil's homeland whom he spots walking throughout the streets with her father who is blind. Immediately, Qindil starts to admire her and decides to ask for her hand in marriage. Qindil's mother is reluctant at first, due to the fact that Halima originates from a family that is of a lesser class and states that Qindil is too young and can marry any other woman but Qindil is insistent. Fattouma al-Azhari - When only seventeen, Fattouma al-Azhari married her husband of eighty years old. Qindil is given the name 'Ibn Fattouma' which means 'son of Fattouma' by his brothers as a means of \\"washing their hands of any possible relationship with them and casting doubts upon my mother.\\" Muhammad al-Innabi - Qindil's father, who is eighty when he falls in love with Fattouma al-Azhari, Qindil's mother and had produced seven notable merchant sons before him. Samia - Qindil falls in love with her in the land of Halba. Qindil's relationships with Arousa and Samia over the course of his travels provide him with deep happiness and satisfaction. His greatest sorrows are in losing his two loves. Sheik Maghagha al-Gibeili - Qindil's teacher who made a journey himself but had to stop before he could visit the land of Gebel due to a war. He marries Qindil's mother as he \\"cannot bear his solitude any longer\\" at the same time as Qindil's marriage to Halima is arranged. He is the tutor who extols the virtues of travel as a way of finding the true meaning of life. Sheikh Hamada al Sabki - Qindil meets him in the land of Halba. He gives the call to prayer in the streets and tells Qindil that in the land of Halba, people preached that Islam encouraged homosexuality. Qindil is taken aback by this news and is disappointed by the New Islam that was manifesting itself in this country. Imam invites Qindil to his house and there, he introduces his daughter, Samia, to him. The Sage in the Land of Ghuroub - He is an Old man located in the forest. He is the instructor of those who are perplexed, and prepares those who desire to make the journey to the Land of Gebel. Theme Throughout his ensuing journey, Ibn Fattouma undergoes many struggles both on an existential and intellectual level as he attempts to determine the meaning of life in relation to who he is. Themes present in Journey of Ibn Fattouma revolve around how to correctly organize a society and his personal existential struggles. The main character in the allegory, Qindil, travels to many lands to try to discover a perfect land and when he cannot find one, readers are left to realize whether a perfect society really exists and what a society should be based on. Qindil attempts to determine the meaning of life in relation to who he is. The story relies heavily on self-interpretation creating a path to discovery for Qindil and the reader leaving everyone to question what the real journey was. Translations The Journey of Ibn Fattouma was first published in Arabic in 1983, as ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿ•ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÅÿ∑ŸàŸÖ. and has since been translated in German, Italian, and English. English translation has been done by Denys Johnson-Davies. Commercial Reception On a scale of A-F, complete-review.com gave Journey of Ibn Fattouma an A-, stating that it is ‚Äúa clever...parable of different forms of governments and societies.‚Äù Critical Reception ‚ÄúThe style of the Arabic original is descriptive, sensuous, and sometimes moving. The translation, coming from the pen of an experienced translator, is meticulously faithful to the original while maintaining complete idiomatic English that flows smoothly.‚Äù- Issa Peters, World Literature Today As said by The Complete Review, ‚ÄúThe Journey of Ibn Fattouma is a clever if occasionally too simplistic parable of different forms of government and society, seen especially -- and very effectively -- in relation to Islam (both theoretical and the less-than-perfect real-life examples of Islamic states). Qindil's travels and observations are engaging and very nicely related‚Ä¶ though much is a bit too quickly brushed over. War breaks out several times too often; presented as it is, it comes to look like an inevitability in practically each of these situations, which doesn't seem to be what Mahfouz means. Qindil's love-life is also a bit odd, his passion understandable but also too quickly indulged in (and then disposed of, as he leaves family after family behind). But the strengths of the text easily outweigh all the weaknesses. An enjoyable and thoughtful novel, certainly recommended,‚Äù and gave it a rating of A-. Erik Cohen describes: ‚ÄúThe original, archaic pilgrimage‚Äù as ‚Äúthe quest for the mythical land of pristine existence, of no evil or suffering, the primaeval centre from which man originally emerged, but eventually lost it,‚Äù (Cohen 182).. . . . . Erik is an Adjunct Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, as well as a member of EPPC's board of directors. As Issa Peters says, ‚ÄúThe Journey of Ibn Fattouma, therefore, is a kind of pilgrim's progress, but the pilgrim here is more of a social reformer than a religious believer impelled by an apocalyptic vision of the divine.\\" Inspiration For Story Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century Moroccan explorer, was the inspiration and historical model for the fictitious journey in The Journey of Ibn Fattouma. He was one of the greatest travelers, having visited most of the known world of his day. Ibn Battuta recorded his experiences for posterity in his famous Journey of Ibn Battuta (partly translated into English by H A R Gibb in 1929). Based on the title, The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, Naguib Mahfouz clearly wants readers to be aware of the medieval work while reading his novel. Mahfouz was inspired by Ibn Battuta's journey to write his book, but he did not approach his historically modeled book with a respectful attitude. His intention was partly to parody Ibn Battuta's journey. ‚ÄúWhereas Ibn Battuta travelled in space, his fictitious descendant travels in time; the five 'lands' he visits being, within the allegorical framework of the book, symbolic of stages in the evolution of organised society from the dawn of history to the present day.‚Äù Mahfouz shows that Ibn Fattouma is modeled off of Ibn Battuta, but is not a mirror image of him. Ibn Fattouma criticizes his homeland, whereas Ibn Battuta idealized Islam, regardless of where he traveled. Ibn Fattouma's critiques of Islam seem to create the basis of his journey, as he searches for a place where life is far more ideal than his homeland. He questions God as a merciful being after seeing ignorance and poverty. This fuels his journey and creates a more complex character than if the story was simply following Ibn Battuta, blindly mimicking his every trait. Literary Significance and Criticism The story is a \\"Morality Play\\"- it is not just what it may first seem, but in reality it's a story of ‚Äúextoling the virtues of tolerance and understanding\\" The Journey of Ibn Fattouma is a simple story of government and society. Critics say that the story is engaging, yet at the same time redundant. Mahfouz is able to capture a lifetime's worth of experiences in one short novel. He is considered as one of the most western of contemporary Arab novelists. Naguib Mahfouz, the author of The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, portrays himself in his writing, and in the lands and characters of the novel. The revolution of 1999 in Egypt influenced Mahfouz and inspired him to place a symbol of rebellion in the lands Qindil visits. Qindil travels to Mashriq, and discovers the underlying rules and restrictions of the seemingly free and open land. He rebels against the land's religion and attempts to teach his son the Islamic faith. As a result, Qindil is exiled and sent away on the next caravan that arrives. Similar to the revolution in Egypt, Qindil did not aggressively revolt using violence and anger. He was reserved and subtle in his actions. While The Journey of Ibn Fattouma symbolizes the development of human history, it also reflects the author and his connection to the Egyptian Revolution. The novel is centered around a young traveler, Ibn Fattouma, who closely resembles a 14th-century traveler, Ibn Battuta. While Battuta did not travel to lands similar to those in the novel, his personality and background matched Fattouma's. Ibn Battuta's purpose was to see how the Islamic religion was perceived and practiced in different parts of the world. Ibn Fattouma was based on this real person, Ibn Battuta, who shared with him many similarities.

Background Following the death of Robert Maxwell, it became clear that he had embezzled a large amount of money from the pension fund of Mirror Group Newspapers. As a result of this, a review was established to look into ways that the running of pension schemes could be improved. The end result was the Pensions Act 1995. Overview The main features of the Act included: * The establishment of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority * The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) to ensure that all pension schemes had a minimum amount of money * A compensation fund for pension schemes in the event of fraud * Protection for existing pension scheme benefits so that they could not be reduced in the future without member consent * A requirement for pension schemes to have member nominated trustees * Greater disclosure of information to members * The introduction of clear documentation showing what should be paid into a scheme, and monitoring of those contributions * A minimum rate of increase to apply once in payment to pension earned after the date on which the Act came into force Many of the features introduced by the Act were abolished or amended by the Pensions Act 2004. The MFR was heavily criticised in the Myners Report (2001),Myners, P. (2001). Institutional investment in the United Kingdom: A review, HM Treasury, London.which was a HM Treasury sponsored report into institutional investment in the UK. The Myners Report identified three problems with the MFR: * For some pension funds, the level of assets under the MFR was insufficient to provide the benefits promised by the scheme * Regulatory costs for sponsoring firms increased without any reduction in the risks of fund insolvency * Sponsoring firms focused on meeting the narrow requirements of the MFR, rather than on ensuring that the scheme was appropriately funded. The Pensions Act 2004 replaced the MFR from September 2005 with a new scheme-specific \\"statutory funding objective\\" (SFO), allowing more flexibility to individual schemes' circumstances whilst at the same time protecting members' benefits. The Act established the Pension Regulator with the power to require sponsoring companies to fully fund their pension liabilities, by adopting an appropriate recovery strategy consistent with the SFO. Liu and Tonks (2012)Liu, W. and I. Tonks (2012) Pension Funding Constraints and Corporate Expenditures, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 2012. DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00693.x examine the effect of a company's pension commitments on its dividend and investment policies, assessing the impact of funding rules under the MFR, and also under the funding requirements introduced under the Pensions Act 2004. They find a strong negative relationship between a firm's dividend payments and its pension contributions, but a weaker effect on investments. They found that dividend and investment sensitivities to pension contributions were more pronounced after the introduction of the Pensions Act 2004. State pensions The Act also affects state pensions. A significant change was the phasing in of equalisation of state pension ages for men and women over a ten-year period.

The film's plot resembles a dark take on the fairy tale \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\". Plot Vanessa Lutz is a poor, illiterate teenage girl living south of Los Angeles. Her mother, Ramona, is arrested in a prostitution sting, and her stepfather, Larry, is taken into custody on drug and child abuse charges. Social worker Mrs. Sheets comes to take Vanessa away, but Vanessa handcuffs her ankle to a bed and runs away. She takes Mrs. Sheets' run-down car and plans to go live with her grandmother in Stockton. Along the way, Vanessa stops to see her boyfriend Chopper Wood, a local gang member, to tell him about her trip, and he gives her a gun to sell upon arriving at her destination. Minutes after Vanessa leaves, Chopper is killed in a drive-by shooting by rival gang members. Later, Bob Wolverton, a counselor at a school for boys with emotional problems, picks her up on the side of the highway after her car breaks down and offers to take her as far as Los Angeles, where he is headed. Over the long drive, Vanessa comes to trust Bob, and confesses to him the details of her painfully dysfunctional life, including being sexually abused by her stepfather and foster parents. At one point, Vanessa shows Bob a photo she keeps in her wallet of her biological father (whose picture, unbeknownst to Vanessa, is of mass murderer Richard Speck). That evening, Bob attacks Vanessa and reveals that he is a serial killer of young girls ‚Äì known in the press as the \\"I-5 Killer\\". He tries to kill Vanessa when she refuses to give in to him. The tables are turned, however, as Vanessa eventually pulls out her gun and berates Bob before shooting him several times and escaping. She goes to a local restaurant where her blood-stained appearance attracts attention from the patrons and staff. They call 911. Leaving the restaurant, Vanessa is arrested and questioned by two police detectives, Mike Breer and Garnet Wallace, who write her off as a carjacker, even though she insists Bob had tried to kill her and had told her about his crimes. Bob survives, but the bullet wounds have left him severely handicapped and facially disfigured. Vanessa is put on trial, with everyone believing that Bob is the innocent victim he claims to be since he has no criminal record, while Vanessa has a long record and is a veteran of juvenile detention centers. Vanessa goes to prison, while Bob and his socialite wife Mimi, who knows nothing of his crimes, are treated like heroes. Initially scared, Vanessa makes friends in prison that include a heroin-addicted lesbian named Rhonda and a brutal Hispanic gang leader named Mesquita. Vanessa plots to escape to her grandmother's house and fashions a crude shiv from a toothbrush, a skill she had learned from her stepfather. During their transport to a new maximum security prison, Vanessa and Mesquita escape after killing a security guard and they go their separate ways. While re-examining evidence, the detectives realize that Vanessa was telling the truth. They search Bob's home and find violent child pornography and human remains in a storage shed. Horrified, Mimi runs upstairs and commits suicide. Evading the police at his home, Bob travels to Vanessa's grandmother's home in a trailer park, using the address written on a picture Vanessa had showed him. Posing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a car from a prospective john and drives to her grandmother's trailer. Vanessa finds Bob in bed wearing her grandmother's nightgown and nightcap with the covers pulled up to his nose. Bob reveals himself and Vanessa sees her grandmother's dead body on the floor. A struggle ensues, culminating in Vanessa strangling Bob. Breer and Wallace arrive and find the bodies of Bob and Vanessa's grandmother. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair in a daze, then asks the detectives if they have a cigarette. They smile, and Vanessa responds in kind.

Critical reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 41 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A modern update on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, Freeway is an audacious black comedy with a star-making performance from the young Reese Witherspoon.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film had a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Critics lauded the film's hard-edged satire and performances. Film critic Roger Ebert gave Freeway three and a half stars out of four and stated, \\"like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland.\\" It received \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" on Siskel and Ebert At the Movies. Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee gave Freeway four stars out of four and called it \\"a wild, audacious drive-in attraction that takes the 'high' from 'highbrow' and the 'low' from 'lowdown' and shakes them up\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave Freeway four stars out of four and said that it was \\"rude in the way the truth is rude--only funnier\\". Margaret A. McGurk wrote for The Cincinnati Enquirer that \\"I didn't particularly want to like Freeway, but I couldn't help myself. Reese Witherspoon made me.\\" Sequel A sequel titled Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby was released in 1999, but was largely disregarded and released direct-to-video.

The website was founded in 2001 by Selena Mooney (\\"Missy Suicide\\") and Sean Suhl (\\"Spooky\\"). Most of the site is only accessible to paying members. It offers members access to images provided by models and photographers worldwide, as well as personal profiles, blogging platforms, and the option to join numerous groups based upon different interests. There is also an online merchandise store offering a range of clothing, books, and DVDs. Suicide Girls have appeared in a variety of media outlets including television shows and music videos. They have also been portrayed by actresses in others, such as the character Dani California on the TV show Californication.  History  In 2001, Mooney returned to Portland, Oregon to study photography after working as director of technology at Ticketmaster. Inspired by Bunny Yeager, Mooney began photographing her friends in the pinup style and wanted to create a website that featured her photographs as well as message boards and blog posts from the models. Mooney's friend, Sean Suhl joined her and the two founded the website. SuicideGirls was originally based in Portland, but relocated its operations to Los Angeles, California in 2003 to be closer to its distributor, label and publisher. That same year, 70 models from the website appeared in a music video for the band Probot. Mooney has stated that the purpose of the site is to give women control over how their sexuality is depicted. The site is privately co-owned. According to Missy, the term \\"Suicide Girl\\" originally comes from Chuck Palahniuk's novel Survivor (1999) where the character talks about masturbating to the troubles of young girls who look up to him: Missy also states that the name describe girls who commit \\"social suicide\\" by breaking away from the norm of society, and created the site \\"as a place to celebrate beautiful women who choose not to fit into the norm and as a corner of the where outsiders could congregate and be appreciated for being themselves.\\" In September 2005, SuicideGirls announced that it would remove a large number of images from its pages, in an effort to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Justice standards at the time. The images involved depicted bondage, weapons, or simulated blood. The Department of Justice indicated that images of that type might be the subject of obscenity prosecutions. Although SuicideGirls was not mentioned as a target, they removed the images until the furor passed. In January 2007, the images were made visible again. In 2006, some of the Suicide Girls were featured in an episode of CSI: NY titled \\"Oedipus Hex\\". In 2015, it was reported that the website had 5 million monthly visitors, with 51 percent of them being female. SuicideGirls 15th anniversary was celebrated at its Peek-A-Boo burlesque show, which is a regular act at Pour Vous nightclub in Los Angeles, and was featured on the website of Maxim magazine. In 2017, SuicideGirls released a line of marijuana vape pens and cartridges called the Chill Hustle Zero line.  Website features  left The website is an online community, formed around pin-up photosets of Suicide Girls. = Photosets = Photosets are a collection of images ranging from fully clothed to fully nude that must share a theme or concept and take place in the same setting. Each photoset contains 40‚Äì60 images and is created by the model and photographer to portray images of \\"alternative\\" beauty, showcasing each model's ideas regarding her own beauty. As of May 2015, there were nearly 8 million images live on the site. Each day, a 'Set of the Day' is bought and featured, appearing on the front page, where official Suicide Girl status begins. The photographs are intended both as an homage to classic pin-up art and a portrayal of images of alternative beauty. The site hosts a collection of staff photographers, however anyone can submit photosets to the site. Actress Paget Brewster has photographed models for the site, as have guitarist Dave Navarro and singer Mike Doughty. = Other features = The members and the models all have the option to create a personal profile, keep journals, upload their own photos and videos, and join public and private groups. The site also features interviews conducted by members and a merchandise shop.  Media  = Movies = SuicideGirls have released seven movies since 2005, each directed by Mike Marshall.

Players can purchase premium content for 220 in-game tokens each, to unlock 5 characters in total. The models featured are: Bob, Gogo, Milloux, Venom and Radeo. Sam Doumit signing a SuicideGirls magazine at San Diego Comic-Con International, 2007 = Books = SuicideGirls have published 4 books since 2004, all featuring a variety of photos from the website and interviews with Suicide Girls. *SuicideGirls (2004, Feral House) *SuicideGirls: Beauty Redefined (2008, Ammo Books) *SuicideGirls: Hard Girls, Soft Light (2013, Ammo Books) *SuicideGirls: Geekology (2014, Ammo Books) = Comic books = SuicideGirls were featured in Hack/Slash: Annual Vol. 1 in 2008, released by Devil's Due Publishing. A SuicideGirls comic book mini-series was released in 2011, by IDW Publishing, containing four issues. The comic books feature pin-up drawings of actual SuicideGirls by artist Cameron Stewart, as well as a historic story written by Steve Niles. Shortly after, a German edition of the combined mini-series was released. = Magazines = SuicideGirls has published three issues of its magazine, otherwise referred to as their 'periodical art book' or 'pin-up anthology'. Issue 1 and 2 were self-published in 2007 and the third issue was released in 2014 by Ammo Books. Issue 4 can be expected in 2016. = Live events = Suicide Girls Blackheart Burlesque dancers performing the Star Wars number  Blackheart Burlesque  The SuicideGirls Blackheart Burlesque group first toured in 2003 and opened for Guns N' Roses and Courtney Love, before suspending the tour for nearly a decade. The show returned in Fall 2013 and has toured across the US, Canada and Australia, selling out numerous shows in each country. The show has also visited the UK and Chile with its high- energy mix of classic and new burlesque dancing, choreographed by Manwe Sauls- Addison. The Blackheart Burlesque hosts a show of cult-classic numbers including performances based on Star Wars and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and pop culture references like Game of Thrones and Fifty Shades of Grey. As of 2016, the show is hosted by Sunny Suicide and Katherine Suicide and features a changing line-up of dancers. During the shows, there is an element of audience participation and guests are encouraged to take photos of the performers and share them on social media.  Ballroom Blitz  The SuicideGirls Ballroom Blitz is a monthly rock and metal club night in the UK, taking place at Camden's Electric Ballroom. It boasts various stage performances including fire performance, pole dancing and classic burlesque, alongside cage dancing and rock, metal and alternative music. Performances come from UK Suicide Girls and Suicide Girl Hopefuls, guest DJs and guest acts from dance and fire performance groups.  Controversies  = Censorship = In 2005, a number of the paid models were reported to have resigned from the site or had their memberships revoked in connection with allegations of censorship and mistreatment of the models by the site's owners. Numerous members have reported that their journals and message board posts were removed because of bullying other members. This practice of deleting either objectionable content, disagreeable content, or membership altogether is referred to by SuicideGirls staffers as \\"zotting\\" and is implemented by the site's owners in the event that members are slanderous or abusive to other members. = Exclusivity agreement and lawsuits = A primary issue in the past has been SuicideGirls modeling contract, which prevented its models (including past models, for a time) from working for competing sites or agencies (specifically those dealing in nude photography or erotica). In response to this, the SuicideGirls website stated that only models \\"who have chosen to be involved in special projects\\" signed an exclusivity agreement in addition to their standard modeling contract barring them from working with direct competitors for a certain amount of time. SG replaced the contract with a model release in 2006. Many models have received many mainstream modeling jobs from the exposure gained through SuicideGirls. Many of the former models involved in the 2005 dispute are now involved with the competing sites GodsGirls and Deviant Nation. Gods Girls have been sued by SuicideGirls LLC for hiring models who were allegedly still under contract with SuicideGirls and for allegedly violating SuicideGirls trademarks. Several former models were also threatened with legal action. In November 2006, SuicideGirls fired one of their main photographers, Philip Warner, (aka Lithium Picnic), for acting as the primary photographer for the website of former SuicideGirl Apnea. The termination was followed in February 2007 by a lawsuit by SuicideGirls against Warner. According to a press release by Warner and Apnea, as of February 2007, none of SuicideGirls LLC's lawsuits or threatened actions against former models or competing sites has resulted in a victory for the plaintiff. However, the legal expenses in the lawsuits have been costly and time-consuming for the defendants. In June 2008, Lithium Picnic and Apnea issued a press release stating \\"We all sat down together and worked out an agreement that is really fair to everyone. [...] We want to make it clear that we 100% have no hostilities towards SuicideGirls in any way anymore, we all came to a really fair agreement over this dispute, and there were no bad people here, just mistakes and misunderstandings.\\" = Reselling photo sets of models to hardcore and pirate sites = In 2006, models discovered that SuicideGirls appeared to have begun reselling SG sets to sites models viewed as hardcore or pirate or at least not what they thought they were agreeing to. = Criticism by models = In an article released in 2005, The Boston Phoenix alternative weekly reported on former models' dissatisfaction with company practices. Models interviewed referred to SuicideGirls president Sean Suhl as \\"verbally abusive\\" and an \\"active misogynist\\", and described the website as a \\"slap in the face to feminism\\". Other allegations surrounding the SuicideGirls' administration have appeared in a number of established publications, including New York Press and Wired magazine. According to statistics released by the website, in July 2005 one model left, followed by 11 in August, 25 in September, and 11 in October. According to former models interviewed in a feature piece by Silicon Valley's magazine Metro Active, this was, in their opinion, due to the general homogenization of the site, \\"a process that alternative subcultures are unfortunately used to\\". = Job loss = Olivia Black, a recent addition to the crew of Las Vegas' Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, and thus the History Channel TV series Pawn Stars, was fired from the show on December 19, 2012, when her previous background as a Suicide Girl was revealed. = Richard Prince's appropriated images = In 2015, American artist Richard Prince appropriated images from the SuicideGirls' Instagram, printed them on canvas, and added remarks into comment threads. The works were displayed at the Frieze Art Fair and one of the images was sold for $90,000. In response, the SuicideGirls sold prints of the images for $90 a piece with the proceeds going to charity.

Delta Sigma Pi was founded on November 7, 1907, at the School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance of New York University (NYU) in New York, New York and is currently headquartered in Oxford, Ohio. The Fraternity has 224 active collegiate chapters and 7 colonies, as well as 57 active alumni chapters, with over 280,000 initiated members. Purpose Delta Sigma Pi is a professional fraternity organized to foster the study of business in universities; to encourage scholarship, social activity and the association of students for their mutual advancement by research and practice; to promote closer affiliation between the commercial world and students of commerce, and to further a higher standard of commercial ethics and culture and the civic and commercial welfare of the community. Official badge, vintage 1970s History In 1911, the fraternity published its first newsletter, which soon would be named The Deltasig. The second chapter was founded at Northwestern School of Commerce. National meetings, called the Grand Chapter Congress, became a regular tradition and to this day the national fraternity meets every other year to conduct business and elect its national leaders.Delta Sigma Pi National Bylaws (34th Edition) After rapid expansion in the early 1920s, the fraternity opened its national headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. In 1957, the central office moved to Oxford, Ohio adjacent to the campus of Miami University. The biggest change in the history of the Fraternity took place in 1975, as the Board of Directors mandated that chapters were allowed to initiate female business students, to conform with Title IX. The red rose was adopted as the official flower of Deltasig at the first Board of Directors Meeting in 1921. It was primarily the gift given to the wives and courted women of Deltasig brothers (which at the time was still all male). One of the founding fathers, Harold V. Jacobs, suggested a rose as the official fraternity flower because his wife loved roses and it was also her first name (Rose Jacobs). Five years later, in 1926, Jacobs also suggested that the song currently sung at LEAD schools and Grand Chapter Congress events, \\"Rose of Deltasig,\\" be adopted as the official song of the fraternity.Los Ellis via the official Deltasig website and Central Office archives in Oxford Ohio The Central Office The Central Office of Delta Sigma Pi, national administrative headquarters, was established in Chicago, Illinois, in 1924. In the fall of 1956, it moved to 330 South Campus Avenue in Oxford, Ohio (near Cincinnati and adjacent to the Miami University campus). In 1970, the original building nearly doubled in size with the addition of wings on either side of the building. Later in 2010 extensive renovations, including a courtyard featuring engraved bricks, were completed to make the building more functional and accessible.

Cl√©ment obtained consent from the Conseil d'Etat to change his name to that of his business in 1909. The extra name celebrated the Chevalier Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard who saved the town of M√©zi√®res in 1521. A statue of the Chevalier stood in front of Cl√©ment's M√©zi√®res factory, and the image was incorporated into the company logo. From 1903 Cl√©ment-Bayard automobiles were built in a modern factory at M√©zi√®res, known as La Mac√©rienne, which Cl√©ment had designed in 1894 mainly for building bicycles. The company entered the field of aviation in 1908, announcing the construction of Louis Capazza's 'planeur', a lenticular airship, in L'A√©rophile in May 1908.: however it was never built. Adolphe Cl√©ment also built Alberto Santos- Dumont's Demoiselle No 19 monoplane that he had designed to compete for the Coupe d'Aviation Ernest Archdeacon prize from the A√©ro-Club de France. It was the world's first series production aircraft and by 1909 Clement-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines alongside their own design. In 1908 'Astra Cl√©ment-Bayard' began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil. In 1914 the factory La Mac√©rienne at M√©zi√®res was seized by the advancing German army and automobile production in Levallois-Perret, Paris, was suspended as the factory was turned over to war production, military equipment and military vehicles, aero engines, airships and planes. In 1922 the company was broken up and the factory in Paris was taken over by Citro√´n. Circa 1909 Adolphe Cl√©ment received permission from the Conseil d'√âtat to change his name to Adolphe Cl√©ment-Bayard. Motor manufacturing A 1904 Cl√©ment-Bayard AC2K (twin-cylinder) in Montevideo, Uruguay Cl√©ment Bayard emblem on the front of a 1907 automobile c.1905 publicity image of Cl√©ment- Bayard showing the statue of the Chevalier Bayard that stood in front of the factory at M√©zi√®res and formed the company logo In 1896 Adolphe Cl√©ment who held the extremely profitable manufacturing rights for Dunlop tyres in France joined with a syndicate led by Dunlop's founder Harvey Du Cros to buy out the Gladiator Cycle Company and they merged it into a major bicycle manufacturing conglomerate of Cl√©ment, Gladiator & Humber & Co Limited. The range was expanded, and in 1902 a motorised bicycle led to cars and motorcycles.(See Cl√©ment Gladiator cycles for further details) Cl√©ment chose the name Bayard in commemoration of the Chevalier Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard who saved the town of M√©zi√®res in 1521. A statue of the Chevalier stood in front of the M√©zi√®res factory, and the image was incorporated into the company logo. After the split both marques built very similar cars, but the specifications gradually diverged. Initially, Cl√©ment-Bayard cars were imported to Britain under the Talbot brand. = Models = The initial model range comprised three models (9Hp, 12Hp, 16Hp) and was enhanced in 1904 with a 6Hp single-cylinder, a 7Hp twin-cylinder, and 14Hp, 20Hp & 27Hp 4-cylinders. From 1904 Cl√©ment- Bayard production at Levallois-Perret increased from 1,800 cars per annum to 3,000 in 1907, employing up to 4,000 workers. The range included several models, all luxurious and high quality, from a small two-seater twin-cylinder 8-10 hp to a big four-cylinder 50-60 hp model that could exceed 60 km/h. In 1907 the 10/12 hp model was introduced with a unitary gearbox and a dashboard radiator. In 1910 Cl√©ment-Bayard started to manufacture a stylish, low cost, small, two-seater roadster, with a 4-cylinder 10/12 hp, and a heater for the driver and passenger. It was very popular and production continued until the outbreak of war in 1914. By 1913 the factories of Levallois and Mezieres were focused on the production of a wide range of products including car chassis, car bodies, cars, trucks, airships, airplanes, motors, canoes, bicycles, engines and generators. On the front page of the 15 November 1913 edition of the Revue de l‚Äôindustrie automobile et a√©ronautique (Review for Automotive and Aerospace Industry) Cl√©ment-Bayard announced a new 4-cylinder 30-40 Hp motor. By early 1914 Cl√©ment-Bayard had a complete range of twelve models, from two to six seats, equipped with engines ranging from a small 7 hp twin-cylinder for less than 7000 francs to a big 6-cylinder 30 Hp unit. Additionally there was a 20 Hp four-cylinder 'valveless' (sleeve-valve) Knight engine which was licensed from Panhard et Levassor. In 1914 the factory La Mac√©rienne at M√©zi√®res was seized by the advancing German army and automobile manufacture in Levallois-Perret, Paris, was suspended as the factory was turned over to war production: military equipment; military vehicles; aero engines; airships; and planes. After World War I motor production resumed with an 8 hp (6 kW) and a 17.6 hp (13.1 kW) model. =Models : 1904, 1907, 1909, 1910= File:Bayard 1904 (15506358679).jpgBayard, 1904 File:Cl√©ment-Bayard 1907.JPGCl√©ment- Bayard (Perret) 4C-4A, 1907 File:Cl√©ment-Bayard Perret 4C-4A 1907 1.JPGCl√©ment-Bayard (Perret) 4C-4A, 1907 File:Clement Bayard 1908.jpgA Cl√©ment-Bayard at the 1908 National Exposition, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil File:Cl√©ment-Bayard 1909.JPGCl√©ment-Bayard, 1909 File:Cl√©ment-Bayard 1910.JPGCl√©ment-Bayard, 1910 Motor racing Albert Cl√©ment driving a Cl√©ment-Bayard at the French Grand Prix 1906 Cl√©ment-Bayard started building automobiles in 1903 and then started building racing cars in 1904.

This was a qualifier for the Coupe Internationale (Gordon Bennett Race). Clement's team-mate Rene Hanriot finished tenth in 8 hours 23 minutes 39.6s but failed to qualify, whilst Marc-Philippe Villemain retired after three laps. At the 1905 Vanderbilt cup on Long Island Cl√©ment drove an 80 hp Cl√©ment-Bayard (France #12) but suffered reliability problems. Cl√©ment retired his Clement-Bayard after the first 166 km lap of the II Coppa Florio at Brescia Italy on 4 September 1905. His team-mate 'Carl√®s' retired after 2 laps. = 1906 season = Cl√©ment-Bayard entered 3 cars for the inaugural 1906 French Grand Prix at Le Mans where Cl√©ment finished third in his 100Hp machine. He completed the 1,238 km event in 12 hours 49 minutes 46.2seconds. Cl√©ment led the race at the end of laps 2 and 5 on the second day. Punctures were common and tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be swapped in about 4 minutes, saving 11 minutes over manually replacing the tyre. These wheels were used by Felice Nazzaro on his FIAT enabling him to wrest second place from Cl√©ment on the second day. His father Adolphe was the owner of Dunlop France. Clement's team- mates \\"De la Touloubre\\" and A. Villemain retired their 100Hp models after 3 and 5 laps respectively.

Cl√©ment's car was entered by 'Alezy' who retired after 4 laps. = 1908 season = The company entered 3 cars for the 1908 French Grand Prix which had 13,963 cc (155 x 185 mm) 4-cylinder overhead camshaft, and Victor Rigal finished 4th. Fernand Gabriel came 12th and Lucien Hautvast with riding mechanic Jean Chassagne retired. = Other events = In 1905 Cl√©ment-Bayard won the Coupe de Calais and 'finished well' at the Course de Dourdan. In both 1907 and 1908 Cl√©ment Bayard won the Coupe de l‚ÄôAutomobile-Club de Cannes, and in 1908 it also won the Tour de France Automobile. Aeroplane manufacture Maurice Clement at the controls of the 1908 Clement Bayard biplane. Cl√©ment-Bayard was an early French manufacturer of aircraft engines and lighter-than-air vehicles, with the earliest flights occurring in 1908. Cl√©ment-Bayard manufactured the world's first series production aircraft. The company worked with Louis Capazza to produce the 'planeur (glider) Bayard-Cl√©ment' which was unveiled in L'A√©rophile on 15 May 1908. The company also started working with Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1908 to build his Demoiselle No 19 monoplane that he had designed to compete for the Coupe d'Aviation Ernest Archdeacon prize from the A√©ro-Club de France. The plane was small and stable, but they planned a production run of 100 units, built 50 and sold only 15 for 7,500 francs for each airframe. It was the world's first series production aircraft. By 1909 it was offered with a choice of 3 engines, Clement 20 hp; Wright 4-cyl 30 hp (Clement-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines); and Clement- Bayard 40 hp designed by Pierre Clerget. It achieved 120 km/h. Pierre Clerget designed a range of Clement-Bayard aircraft engines including a 7-cylinder supercharged radial, the 4-cyl 40 hp used on the Demoiselle, a 4-cyl 100 hp used on 'Hanriot Etrich' monoplanes, and a V8 200 hp airship engine. A two- cylinder Clement-Bayard engine on display In 1910 the Clement-Bayard Monoplane No. 1 was introduced at the Paris show. Jean Chassagne who was working on the development and testing, participating successfully in variety of early aviation challenges winning endurance, altitude and speed prizes. By 1912 Cl√©ment-Bayard built a biplane plus three different models of horizontally opposed aircraft engines. In November 1912 the Clement-Bayard Monoplane No. 5 was introduced. It was powered by a Gnome 7-cylinder rotary engine producing . The pilot sat in an aluminium-and-leather tub. In 1913 a three-seater biplane was introduced as part of the military project, the Clement-Bayard No. 6. It was configured for two observers in front of the pilot, and was powered by either a 4-cyl Clement-Bayard or 4-cylinder Gnome engine. In 1914 Cl√©ment- Bayard produced a steel scouting monoplane powered by either an motor or a Gnome et Rh√¥ne engine. The nickel steel armour was designed for protection against rifle fire. Airship manufacture Clement-Bayard Airship No 1, The \\"Adjudant Vincenot\\" circa 1910. Caption from Popular Mechanics magazine 1910 In 1908 'Astra Cl√©ment-Bayard' began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil in response to a French Army decision to commence airship operations. The Cl√©ment-Bayard No.1 airship was offered to the French government but was too expensive so it was bought by Tsar Nicholas II for the Russian army. In 1910 the Cl√©ment-Bayard No.2, piloted by Maurice Cl√©ment, was the first airship to cross the Channel, travelling over 380 km in 6 hours. The army ordered 3 copies. The airship hangar in La Motte-Breuil is still maintained by Cl√©ment-Talbot Ltd. =Cl√©ment-Bayard dirigibles= Seven Cl√©ment-Bayard airships were completed. * N¬∞ 1 was 56.25 metres long, 10.58 metres wide, 3,500 m3, powered by 2 Cl√©ment Bayard 115 cv engines.

Factories used by Cl√©ment-Bayard * In 1894 he started construction work on a former military site in the Faubourg Saint-Julien at M√©zi√®res, to build a new factory, which would become known as La Mac√©rienne. Cl√©ment personally supervised the work remotely using photographs taken every day and visiting the site once a week. By 1897 it was producing components and spokes for the Gladiator Cycle Company. It covered 15,000 m2 and using a hydraulic turbine power plant, a steam room, large machine hall, a foundry, a workshop for the nickel processing, the operation with the manufacturing of nuts and spokes on a bike. The factory building still exists but in the spring of 2006 it was transformed into a cultural center. * Clement-Bayard Automobiles was situated at the Boulevard de la Saussaye 57 in Neuilly in west Paris. Between 1899 and 1922, three wheelers and cars were built there. * Shortly after the purchase of Gladiator cycles in 1896 Adolfe Cl√©ment began to build the new factory at Levallois-Perret in north west Paris. This produced cycles and various cars from 1898, (Cl√©ment-Panhard, Cl√©ment-Gladiator from 1901, Cl√©ment-Bayard from 1903), and went on to build various Citro√´n models including the Citro√´n 2CV for nearly forty years from 1948 to 1988. From August 1914 it was dedicated to wartime production. * In 1908 'Astra Cl√©ment-Bayard' began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil. War activity Adolphe Cl√©ment ceded control of Cl√©ment-Bayard to his son Maurice in early 1914, but the consequences of World War I for the company were disastrous. The La Mac√©rienne factory at M√©zi√®res was lost to the Germans, the machinery was shipped back to Germany, and the forges, foundries and smelter were destroyed. The gutted building was used as an indoor riding school for German officers. Automobile production at Levallois-Perret in Paris was suspended in August 1914 and the factory was turned over to war production, military equipment and military vehicles, aero engines, airships and planes. Demise In 1922 the Cl√©ment- Bayard automobile company was sold to Andr√© Citro√´n, in whom Adolphe Cl√©ment also invested financially, and the factory at Levallois-Perret became the centre of 2CV manufacturing for the next 40 years.

History  Horacio Anasagasti was a student of German engineer Otto Krause. Shortly after creating his own workshop, he founded the Anasagasti company in 1909, where he repaired automobile, aviation and agricultural engines.Web Autohistoria.com.ar: Biograf√≠a de Horacio Anasagasti In 1910 he presented his first prototype at the Exposici√≥n Internacional de Ferrocarriles y Transportes Terrestres (International Exhibition of Railways and Land Transportation): a 4-cylinder in-line engine and a 4-speed gearbox and recoil, which won the Grand Prize Diploma of the exhibition. After a trip to Europe to find suppliers, in 1911 he finally created his first vehicle, a 15 horsepower (11 kW) Ballot-engined car, with a French engine and Argentine body, being presented on September 17 in the Rosario-C√≥rdoba-Rosario race. It began selling in 1912 for $ 6500. The first versions were equipped with the French engine of 2125 cm3 and were offered with double phaeton bodies and a single door on the left side. In 1912-13 he entered cars built to his design in Europe. He sent three cars to Europe to participate in different races: a team of the cars competed in the 1912 Tour de France, while a lone Picker-engined racer was entered in the 1913 Coupe de l'Auto. The \\"Anasagasti\\" was winner of the 1515 km Paris-Madrid race. Anasagasti then returned home to Argentina, where he is believed to have built about 50 touring models. With the outbreak of World War I it was very difficult to get supplies and the company closed in 1915. At the close of Anasagasti & Cia there were approximately 50 units, most of which continued to work as a taxi in Buenos Aires.  Survivors  An example of a 1914 Anasagasti car, previously used by the Argentine Air Force, is preserved at the Museo Nacional de Aeron√°utica de Argentina, located at Mor√≥n, Buenos Aires. This vehicle was personally donated by Anasagasti to his friend Engineer Jorge Newbery on September 8, 1912. Newbery used it to transport the mail to the Aeroparque.

Set in New York's fashion industry, the show centered on top modeling agency owner Racine (Morgan Fairchild), her conflicts with the family of cosmetics tycoon Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), and the careers of two teenage models (Terry Farrell and Nicollette Sheridan). The series was based on a 1982 TV movie of the same name. The show suffered in the ratings, despite good reviews, and was cancelled midway through the first season.  1982 TV movie  Prior to the TV series, a TV movie had been made and shown in 1982. The TV movie was based more around modeling than the fashion industry, and featured Joan Collins, Daryl Hannah and Alexandra Paul in the roles that would be taken by Fairchild, Sheridan and Farrell in the series (Jennifer Warren and Jeffrey Richman were the only two actors to appear in both the TV movie and the 1984 series). The movie's theme song was \\"Paper Doll\\", written by Mark Snow and performed by Brock Walsh. 1984 TV series (Clockwise from top) Terry Farrell, Morgan Fairchild, and Nicollette Sheridan In 1984, MGM decided to produce a weekly series based on the TV movie for ABC, recasting several of the original roles from the 1982 production. Racine (Morgan Fairchild) was the owner of a prestigious Manhattan modeling agency and was frequently at odds with Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), who helmed the board of Harper Cosmetics, a division of his family's corporation, Harper WorldWide Incorporated. Grant was well- meaning but he could be relentless and stubborn in getting his own way with business and his family. Playing both sides was Grant's son Wesley (Dack Rambo) who thirsted for more power in the family business and allied himself romantically with Racine. (Wesley also resented his father, whom he blamed for the accidental death of his mother, Grant's first wife, Virginia.) Grant was then married to his second wife, Marjorie (Nancy Olson). Wesley's half-sister, Blair Harper Fenton (Mimi Rogers) (Marjorie was her mother) was a supermodel, (in fact, she was Racine's first client when she opened her modeling agency and she was also considered a good friend of Racine's) who was fearing her career was on the downslide now that she was 30 years old and pregnant. Despite health problems, Blair was determined to carry her baby to full term. Grant tended to fawn over Blair a lot. Blair's husband David Fenton (Richard Beymer) was a sportswear designer (he owned Tempus Sportswear). David and Wesley were at odds because of the former marrying his half-sister. Unfortunately, because David was too proud to accept financial assistance from his in-laws, the Harpers, his business partner had to resort to accepting money from loan sharks to fund his upcoming collection, which put David and Blair in serious danger. Eventually, David did ask his father in-law for help, the results of which brought Tempus under the Harper WorldWide banner, paid off the loan in full, and also the interest. Racine was also at odds with Taryn Blake (Nicollette Sheridan), the top teen model in the business who was proving to be a liability due to unprofessional behavior, problems with drugs and alcohol, and a sensationalized romance with 1980s pop star John Waite (playing himself for several episodes). To keep Taryn and her demanding mother/manager Julia (Brenda Vaccaro) in line, Racine decided to promote a new fresh teen face, a young woman named Laurie Caswell (Terry Farrell). The naive and innocent Laurie wasn't prepared for the fast success, despite her mother Dinah Anderson Caswell's (Jennifer Warren) best efforts to keep her grounded. Dinah, a former model herself, and having had previous modeling experience, spent a lot of time on her daughter's career that in turn started causing problems in her marriage to Michael Caswell (John Bennett Perry), who was Laurie's stepfather. Michael disagreed with Laurie being a model; while Dinah saw it as a rewarding experience for Laurie, which would help her build up her low self-esteem and it also reminded her of her own days as a model. Despite their vast differences, Taryn and Laurie became good friends. Laurie attended public school in her hometown, Stonehurst, on Long Island, despite her being a model. Taryn wished that Dinah, who was much more compassionate than the overbearing Julia, was her mother. Vindictive and mean-spirited Julia merely saw her daughter as a meal ticket and Taryn, who only wanted to be a normal teenager, clearly resented that. Because of this, Mother and Daughter would clash repeatedly. Julia, who was also very greedy, also dreaded the day that Taryn would turn seventeen, because then, her daughter would be considered legal age as a model and the money would go directly to her and not to her mother. Julia and Dinah would also become rivals because of Taryn and Laurie being models. Because her life as a successful model was severely regimented by Julia, Taryn, who had been a model ever since she was a small child, was very lonely and she wasn't often allowed to socialize with other people her age. Because of this, Taryn saw Laurie as the only real friend she had, and she offered to teach her all she knew about the world of modeling and fashion. Laurie not only had to deal with the pressures of the world of modeling, but as she was still in public school, she had to also contend with the regular teenage trials of friends and high school grades. Mark Bailey (Roscoe Born), a reporter doing a story on the fashion industry, became enamored with Racine, causing problems in his relationship with sensible lawyer Sara Frank (Anne Schedeen), who was Blair's best friend. A suspicious Sara cautioned her boyfriend on becoming too interested in Racine, commenting \\"She's been in more beds than a hotel breakfast tray!\\" She still admired Racine's success, by commenting, \\"She's done well for a girl named off of a map of Wisconsin.\\"  Reception  The series attempted to ride the wave of popular glossy nighttime soaps such as Dallas and Dynasty. When Paper Dolls premiered in September 1984, the first episode achieved an 18.4 rating. It featured the requisite stock pleasures such as big business, glamour, intrigue, catfights and verbal spats (particularly between Racine and most of the other characters). In one scene, Mark entered Racine's office while she was getting a massage. He asked, \\"Do you want me to wait outside until you're decent?\\" Racine responded, \\"How much time do you have?\\" In another scene, an irate Julia, brandishing a Barbie-style fashion doll of her daughter, stormed into Racine's office. \\"This will not be the new Taryn Blake doll!\\" she barked. \\"The eyes are brown!\\" Coolly, Racine quipped, \\"I guess they couldn't quite match that bloodshot tone.\\" Even with a series of rave reviews in People magazine urging viewers to give the show a chance, ratings were low and the series was not able to find an audience, something due in large part by the fact that the show had been preempted on some weeks by the baseball playoffs. The final episode of the series found David on the verge of failure after an influential fashion critic was blackmailed by Wesley and Racine to pan his new sportswear collection; Grant's wife Marjorie (Nancy Olson) was feared dead in a plane crash; and Racine received a call from Mark intimating that his digging into her secretive past had uncovered something very interesting. The cliffhangers were left unresolved.

With a history dating back to 1984, they are the oldest death metal band from the Netherlands. Their second album, Realm of Ecstasy (some album covers show Realm of ), received positive marks from Dutch music magazine Oor and various international magazines for its solid compositions and challenging arrangements.\\"Thanatos,\\" Popencyclopedie, Muziekcentrum Nederland After enduring constantly changing line-ups and problems with distribution, promotion, and even ownership of the rights to the second album, Thanatos folded in 1992, the final straw being the cancellation of a tour with Cannibal Corpse and Exhorder. In 1999, founding member Stephan Geb√©di revived the band, which signs with Hammerheart Records. After re-releasing the first two albums with demo and live tracks, the band's third full album, Angelic Encounters, emerged in 2000. In 2002 a mini-CD with original songs as well as covers from Celtic Frost and Possessed is released by Baphomet. After a few shows in Greece and a short tour with Pungent Stench, the band record their fourth album, Undead. Unholy. Divine, described as a solid return to 1980s metal (in the style of Slayer, Possessed) with the addition of blast beats. Release of a fifth album, Justified Genocide, was postponed when the band's label at the time, Black Lotus Records, went bankrupt; Dan Swano finished the mix for the CD. To celebrate more than twenty years of Dutch death metal, Thanatos releases (on Chinese label AreaDeath Productions) a limited-edition box containing Emerging From The Netherworlds, Realm Of Ecstasy, and Angelic Encounters, besides 56 bonus tracks and 19 videos. In February 2009, the band issued an update containing details about their upcoming album Justified Genocide. It was released on March 15 in Europe and April 6 in the UK and Ireland.\\"Justified Genocide Details\\" - Blabbermouth.net Century Media Records signed the band in 2012. The initial plan was to re-release the five studio albums of the band in 2012 and 2013, but the label offered the band a new recording contract which resulted in a new studio album from Thanatos in 2014, entitled Global Purification. This coincided with the band's 30th anniversary in that year. In 2019, Thanatos celebrated their 35th anniversary with a double-CD compilation album, a 7 inch vinyl EP and a special show in their hometown Rotterdam featuring a lot of former band members. Later that year Thanatos signed a new record deal with French label Listenable Records and started recording their seventh studio album. The album, Violent Death Rituals, had a March 2020 release.

Here an associative algebra is a (not necessarily unital) ring. If the algebra is not unital, it may be made so in a standard way (see the adjoint functors page); there is no essential difference between modules for the resulting unital ring, in which the identity acts by the identity mapping, and representations of the algebra.  Examples  = Linear complex structure = One of the simplest non-trivial examples is a linear complex structure, which is a representation of the complex numbers C, thought of as an associative algebra over the real numbers R. This algebra is realized concretely as \\\\mathbb{C} = \\\\mathbb{R}[i]/(i^2+1), which corresponds to . Then a representation of C is a real vector space V, together with an action of C on V (a map \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathrm{End}(V)). Concretely, this is just an action of , as this generates the algebra, and the operator representing (the image of in End(V)) is denoted J to avoid confusion with the identity matrix I. = Polynomial algebras = Another important basic class of examples are representations of polynomial algebras, the free commutative algebras ‚Äì these form a central object of study in commutative algebra and its geometric counterpart, algebraic geometry. A representation of a polynomial algebra in variables over the field K is concretely a K-vector space with commuting operators, and is often denoted K[T_1,\\\\dots,T_k], meaning the representation of the abstract algebra K[x_1,\\\\dots,x_k] where x_i \\\\mapsto T_i. A basic result about such representations is that, over an algebraically closed field, the representing matrices are simultaneously triangularisable. Even the case of representations of the polynomial algebra in a single variable are of interest ‚Äì this is denoted by K[T] and is used in understanding the structure of a single linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space. Specifically, applying the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to this algebra yields as corollaries the various canonical forms of matrices, such as Jordan canonical form. In some approaches to noncommutative geometry, the free noncommutative algebra (polynomials in non- commuting variables) plays a similar role, but the analysis is much more difficult. Weights Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be generalized to algebra representations. The generalization of an eigenvalue of an algebra representation is, rather than a single scalar, a one-dimensional representation \\\\lambda\\\\colon\\\\ A \\\\to R (i.e., an algebra homomorphism from the algebra to its underlying ring: a linear functional that is also multiplicative).Note that for a field, the endomorphism algebra of a one- dimensional vector space (a line) is canonically equal to the underlying field: End(L) = K, since all endomorphisms are scalar multiplication; there is thus no loss in restricting to concrete maps to the base field, rather than to abstract 1-dimensional representations. For rings there are also maps to quotients rings, which need not factor through maps to the ring itself, but again abstract 1-dimensional modules are not needed. This is known as a weight, and the analog of an eigenvector and eigenspace are called weight vector and weight space. The case of the eigenvalue of a single operator corresponds to the algebra R[T], and a map of algebras R[T] \\\\to R is determined by which scalar it maps the generator T to. A weight vector for an algebra representation is a vector such that any element of the algebra maps this vector to a multiple of itself ‚Äì a one-dimensional submodule (subrepresentation). As the pairing A \\\\times M \\\\to M is bilinear, \\"which multiple\\" is an A-linear functional of A (an algebra map A ‚Üí R), namely the weight. In symbols, a weight vector is a vector m \\\\in M such that am = \\\\lambda(a)m for all elements a \\\\in A, for some linear functional \\\\lambda ‚Äì note that on the left, multiplication is the algebra action, while on the right, multiplication is scalar multiplication. Because a weight is a map to a commutative ring, the map factors through the abelianization of the algebra \\\\mathcal{A} ‚Äì equivalently, it vanishes on the derived algebra ‚Äì in terms of matrices, if v is a common eigenvector of operators T and U, then T U v = U T v (because in both cases it is just multiplication by scalars), so common eigenvectors of an algebra must be in the set on which the algebra acts commutatively (which is annihilated by the derived algebra). Thus of central interest are the free commutative algebras, namely the polynomial algebras. In this particularly simple and important case of the polynomial algebra \\\\mathbf{F}[T_1,\\\\dots,T_k] in a set of commuting matrices, a weight vector of this algebra is a simultaneous eigenvector of the matrices, while a weight of this algebra is simply a k-tuple of scalars \\\\lambda = (\\\\lambda_1,\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_k) corresponding to the eigenvalue of each matrix, and hence geometrically to a point in k-space. These weights ‚Äì in particularly their geometry ‚Äì are of central importance in understanding the representation theory of Lie algebras, specifically the finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras. As an application of this geometry, given an algebra that is a quotient of a polynomial algebra on k generators, it corresponds geometrically to an algebraic variety in k-dimensional space, and the weight must fall on the variety ‚Äì i.e., it satisfies defining equations for the variety. This generalizes the fact that eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in one variable.

Started by John Gary Anderson, the company sold cars through a national dealer network. The company used Continental 7R flathead six engines in its vehicles, which were noted for their attractive body styles and color combinations. Andersons were the first cars to be built with headlight foot dimmers and powered convertible tops.The McClatchy Co., About Rock Hill, Trivia Production reached nearly 2,000 units in 1923 and in all 7,000 vehicles were produced during the life of the company. There are a number of reasons why the Anderson Automobile Co. faltered. According to Edward Lee, who wrote the 2007 book John Gary Anderson and His Maverick Motor Company: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Rock Hill Rival, the vehicle suffered from a defective engine.[Rock 'Detroit' Hill?; Visionary Help Build Tons of Cars Here and Mold Young City, Charlotte Observer, July 25, 2005] Anderson bought most of the components from other manufacturers. During the later years of production, Anderson used a Continental engine with an aluminum head and it warped at high temperatures.[Rock 'Detroit' Hill?; Visionary Help Build Tons of Cars Here and Mold Young City, Charlotte Observer, July 25, 2005] Price was also an issue, Lee believes. Model T Fords were selling for as little as $290 in the 1920s, making the cars affordable to the majority of Americans. Andersons cost about $1,650 for a five-passenger touring car and $2,550 for a sedan. Anderson's slogan was a \\"A little Higher in Price but made in Dixie.\\"[Rock 'Detroit' Hill?; Visionary Help Build Tons of Cars Here and Mold Young City, Charlotte Observer, July 25, 2005] Anderson's strategy was to invest in the opulence of his vehicles, hoping that consumers would be willing to pay a higher price in return. The strategy failed because customers were more price-sensitive than Anderson anticipated. In addition, by the early 1920s, the economy of South Carolina and other Southern states were already declining, well ahead of the Great Depression, because of plummeting cotton prices following World War I.[Rock 'Detroit' Hill?; Visionary Help Build Tons of Cars Here and Mold Young City, Charlotte Observer, July 25, 2005] The Anderson Automobile Co. was liquidated in 1926.

She was the wife of her father's co-ruler Lucius Verus and an elder sister to later Emperor Commodus. Commodus ordered Lucilla's execution after a failed assassination and coup attempt when she was about 33 years old. Early life Born and raised in Rome into an influential political family, Lucilla was a younger twin with her elder brother Gemellus Lucillae, who died around 150. Lucilla‚Äôs maternal grandparents were Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and Roman Empress Faustina the Elder and her paternal grandparents were Domitia Lucilla and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. Marriages and ascension to Empress Lucilla depicted as Venus, 166-169 AD In 161, when she was between 11 and 13 years old, Lucilla's father arranged a marriage for her with his co-ruler Lucius Verus.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 71.1, 3; 73.4.4‚Äì5. Verus, 18 years her senior, became her husband three years later in Ephesus in 164. At this marriage, she received her title of Augusta and became a Roman Empress.Lightman, Marjorie and Lightman, Benjamin, A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women, Infobase Publishing, 2008. . At the same time, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus were fighting a Parthian war in Syria. Lucilla and Lucius Verus had three children: * Aurelia Lucilla was born in 165 in Antioch * Lucilla Plautia * Lucius Verus Aurelia and the boy died young.Peacock, Phoebe B., Library of Congress, Lucius Verus (161‚Äì169 A.D.), roman- emperors.org. Accessed 29 May 2012. Lucilla was an influential and respectable woman and she enjoyed her status. She spent much time in Rome, while Verus was away from Rome much of the time, fulfilling his duties as a co-ruler. Lucius Verus died around 168/169 while returning from the war theater in the Danube region, and as a result, Lucilla lost her status as Empress. Dupondius depicting Lucilla Augusta (obverse) and Juno Regina with a peacock (reverse) As an unattached link to Emperor Aurelius and to the late co-Emperor Verus and because of her royal-born offspring, Lucilla was not destined for a long widowhood, and thus, a short time later, in 169, her father arranged a second marriage for her with Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus from Antioch. He was a Syrian Roman who was twice consul and a political ally to her father, but Lucilla and her mother were against the marriage as a less than ideal match, partly because Quintianus was at least twice Lucilla's age, but also because he was not of her own Roman nobilis social rank though he was descended from rulers in the East. They married nonetheless and, about a year later, in 170, Lucilla bore him a son named Pompeianus. Rise of Commodus In 172, Lucilla and Quintianus accompanied Marcus Aurelius to Vindobona (now Vienna) in support of the Danube military campaign and were with him on 17 March 180, when Aurelius died and Commodus became the new emperor. The change meant that any hope of Lucilla becoming Empress again was lost and she and Quintianus returned to Rome. Lucilla was not happy living the quiet life of a private citizen in Rome, and hated her sister-in-law Bruttia Crispina. Over time, Lucilla became very concerned with her brother Commodus' erratic behaviour and its resulting effect on the stability of the empire. Plot to assassinate Commodus In light of her brother's unstable rule, in 182 Lucilla became involved in a plot to assassinate Commodus and replace him with her husband and herself as the new rulers of Rome. Her co-conspirators included Publius Tarrutenius Paternus the Praetorian prefect, her daughter Plautia from her first marriage, a nephew of Quintianus also called Quintianus, and her paternal cousins, the former consul Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus and his sister Ummidia Cornificia Faustina.Lucius Aurelius Commodus (AD 161 ‚Äì AD 192), roman-empire.net. Accessed 29 May 2012. Quintianus' nephew, brandishing a dagger or sword, bungled the assassination attempt. As he burst forth from his hiding place to commit the deed, he boasted to Commodus \\"Here is what the Senate sends to you\\", giving away his intentions before he had the chance to act. Commodus's guards were faster than Quintianus and the would-be assassin was overpowered and disarmed without injuring the emperor.Gibbon, Edward, The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, Vol. 1, Chap. 4, Part I. Commodus ordered the deaths of Quintianus' nephew and of Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus, and banished Lucilla, her daughter and Ummidia Cornificia Faustina to the Italian island of Capri. He sent a centurion there to execute them later that year. Her son Pompeianus was later murdered by Caracalla. In popular culture * In the 1964 film The Fall of the Roman Empire, Lucilla is played by Sophia Loren, her part in the film's plot bearing only a very loose relation to her real life. * In the 2000 film Gladiator, Lucilla is played by Connie Nielsen. * In the 2016 six-part docuseries Roman Empire: Reign of Blood, Lucilla is played by Tai Berdinner-Blades.

Life and career  Casella was born in Turin, the son of Maria (n√©e Uordino) and Carlo Casella. His family included many musicians: his grandfather, a friend of Paganini's, was first cello in the San Carlo Theatre in Lisbon and eventually became soloist in the Royal Chapel in Turin. Alfredo's father, Carlo, was also a professional cellist, as were Carlo's brothers Cesare and Gioacchino; his mother was a pianist, who gave the boy his first music lessons. Alfredo entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1896 to study piano under Louis Di√©mer and composition under Gabriel Faur√©; in these classes, George Enescu and Maurice Ravel were among his fellow students. During his Parisian period, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla were acquaintances, and he was also in contact with Ferruccio Busoni, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Casella developed a deep admiration for Debussy's output after hearing Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune in 1898, but pursued a more romantic vein (stemming from Strauss and Mahler) in his own writing of this period, rather than turning to impressionism. His first symphony of 1905 is from this time, and it is with this work that Casella made his debut as a conductor when he led the symphony's premiere in Monte Carlo in 1908. Back in Italy during World War I, he began teaching piano at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. From 1927 to 1929 Casella was the principal conductor of the Boston Pops, where he was succeeded by Arthur Fiedler. He was one of the best-known Italian piano virtuosos of his generation and together with Arturo Bonucci (cello) and Alberto Poltronieri (violin) he formed the Trio Italiano in 1930. This group played to great acclaim in Europe and America. His stature as a pianist and his work with the trio gave rise to some of his best-known compositions, including A Notte Alta, the Sonatina, Nove Pezzi, and the Six Studies, Op. 70, for piano. For the trio to play on tour, he wrote the Sonata a Tre and the Triple Concerto. Casella had his biggest success with the ballet La Giara, set to a scenario by Luigi Pirandello; other notable works include Italia, the Concerto Romano (commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker and premiered at the Wanamaker Auditorium in New York with the organ and Wanamaker collection of rare string instruments), Partita and Scarlattiana for piano and orchestra, the Violin and Cello Concerti, Paganiniana, and the Concerto for Piano, Strings, Timpani and Percussion. Amongst his chamber works, both Cello Sonatas are played with some frequency, as is the very beautiful late Harp Sonata, and the music for flute and piano. Casella also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Aeolian Duo-Art system, all of which survive today and can be heard. In 1923, together with Gabriele D'Annunzio and Gian Francesco Malipiero from Venice, he founded an association to promote the spread of modern Italian music, the \\"Corporation of the New Music.\\" The resurrection of Antonio Vivaldi's works in the 20th century is mostly thanks to the efforts of Casella, who in 1939 organised the now historic Vivaldi Week, in which the poet Ezra Pound was also involved. Since then Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed almost universal success and the advent of historically informed performance has only strengthened his position. In 1947 the Venetian businessman Antonio Fanna founded the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, with the composer Malipiero as its artistic director, with the purpose of promoting Vivaldi's music and putting out new editions of his works. Casella's work on behalf of his Italian Baroque musical ancestors put him at the centre of the early 20th-century Neoclassical revival in music and influenced his own compositions profoundly. His editions of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven's piano works, along with many others, proved extremely influential on the musical taste and performance style of Italian players in the following generations. The generazione dell'ottanta (\\"generation of '80\\"), including Casella himself, Malipiero, Respighi, Pizzetti, and Alfano ‚Äî all composers born around 1880, the post-Puccini generation ‚Äî concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than operas, which Puccini and his musical forebears had specialised in. Members of this generation were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini's death in 1924; they had their counterparts in Italian literature and painting. Casella, who was especially passionate about painting, accumulated an important collection of art and sculptures. He was perhaps the most \\"international\\" in outlook and stylistic influences of the generazione dell'ottanta, owing at least in part to his early musical training in Paris and the circle in which he lived and worked while there. He died in Rome. Casella's students included Clotilde Coulombe, Stefan Bardas, Maria Curcio, Francesco Mander, Branka Musulin, Maurice Ohana, Robin Orr, Primo≈æ Ramov≈°, Nino Rota, Maria Tipo, Gaetano Giuffr√®, Camillo Togni, and Bruna Monestiroli. He was married in Paris in 1921 to Yvonne M√ºller (Paris 1892 ‚Äì Rome 1977). Their granddaughter is actress Daria Nicolodi and their great- granddaughter is actress Asia Argento.

CPRM struggles for a separate Gorkhaland state to be formed within India. It contested the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council election in 1999 but won no seat. Before 1999, one CPRM member, Padam Lama, was a member of the DGHC. Ahead of the 1999 DGHC elections, CPRM was part of the United Front, an alliance consisting of CPRM, Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti, Communist Party of India, Bharatiya Nepali Bir Gorkha and Sikkim Rashtriya Mukti Morcha.

History In concept it was something like the Bean and Cubitt; the idea was that one model would be mass-produced, as Ford had done so successfully. The car was an assembly of proprietary parts, containing as it had a 2.3-litre side-valve engine from Tylor, a 3 speed gearbox and rear axle by Wrigley, Woodhead springs, and Goodyear wheels. One distinctive feature were disc wheels with a wavy pattern.Baldwin, Nick, \\"A-Z of Cars of the 1920s\\", Bay View Books, Bideford, Devon, 1998 Indeed, the company made fewer of its own parts than any other British car company at the time.

It was built by Pope Julius III in 1551‚Äì1553 on what was then the edge of the city. Today it is publicly owned, and houses the Museo Nazionale Etrusco, a collection of Etruscan art and artifacts. A 1935 medal at the British Museum. History =Location= The villa was built in an area of Rome known as the 'Vigna Vecchia' (which was once against the city walls), lying on the slopes of Monte Parioli, as a 'Villa Suburbana' and a place of repose. =Design= The pope, a highly literate connoisseur of the arts, assigned the initial design of the building to Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola in 1551-1553. The nymphaeum and other garden structures, however, were designed by Bartolomeo Ammanati, all under the supervision of Giorgio Vasari. Michelangelo also worked there. Pope Julius took a direct interest in the villa's design and decor and spent vast amounts of money on enhancing its beauties. Villa Giulia became one of the most delicate examples of Mannerist architecture. Only a small part of the original property has survived intact, comprising three vineyards which extended down to the Tiber, and to which the pope traveled often by boat. The villa, as was customary, had an urban entrance (on the Roman Via Flaminia) and a formal but rural garden entrance. The villa itself was on the threshold between two worlds, that of the city and that of the country, an essentially Roman concept. A medal struck in 1935 shows the villa as substantially complete, but with a pair of cupolas which were never executed. Vignola's urban front of the building is a somber two story facade with each story being given equal value. It has at its centre the triple rhythm of a richly detailed rusticated triumphal arch flanked by symmetrical wings of two bays only. The facade is terminated at each end by Doric pilasters. In this facade of the Villa Giulia is the genesis of the seven-bay 18th century Georgian villa, which was reproduced as far away as the Tidewater region of Virginia. View of the nimphaeum loggias The rear of the building has Vignola's large hemispherical loggia overlooking the first of three courtyards, laid out as a simple parterre. At its rear the visitor passes through the casina, which again has a hemispherical rear facade, enclosing paired flights of re-entrant marble steps that give access to the heart of the villa complex: a two-story Nympheum for alfresco dining during the heat of the summer. This three-levelled structure of covered loggias, decorated with marble statuary, reclining river gods in niches, and balustrading, is constructed around a central fountain. Here in this cool environment, sheltered from the blazing sun, day-long picnics would be held. The central fountain, Fontana dell'Acqua Vergine, was designed and sculpted by Vasari and Ammannati: it depicts river gods and caryatids. The fountain's source, the Acqua Vergine, also supplies the Trevi Fountain in Rome. The Casino della Vigna (\\"little house in the vineyard\\"), as it was sometimes known, and its gardens were set in the midst of vineyards, which could be viewed from shaded arcades on the outsides of the garden walls. Papal parties embarked on boats at the gates of the Vatican and were transported up the Tiber to the villa's long-gone private landing stage. =Later history= Following Pope Julius' death, his successor Pope Paul IV confiscated all the properties he had assembled; the villa was divided, and the main building and part of the gardens became the property of the Camera apostolica. The Villa was reserved for the use of the new pope's Borromeo nephews. It was restored in 1769 on the initiative of Pope Clement XIV, confiscated by the new state of Italy in 1870, and given over to the National Etruscan Museum in the early 20th century.

The Court History includes several stories with a distinctly negative attitude towards King David (e.g., the story of his adultery with Bathsheba).

A Study of 2 Samuel 9-20 and 1 Kings 1-2\\", Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 91, No. 2 (Jun., 1972), pp. 172-181 Richard Elliott Friedman suggested in his book The Hidden Book in the Bible (1999)Friedman, R. E., The Hidden Book in the Bible, 1999, that the Court History and the Accession History were originally part of a single historical epic written by the Yahwist author covering the history of the Israelite world until the time of David and Solomon. Friedman's thesis in The Hidden Book in the Bible is that the Yahwist author wrote many of the most familiar stories in the Hebrew Bible, including the stories of Adam and Eve, Abraham, Moses, and David, as one unified text. The Hidden Book analyses the punctuation patterns, word choice, sentence structure and allusions used in the biblical stories; and reconstructs what Friedman says is the original, foundational text at the heart of the Bible.

After a master's degree in Physics from Vienna University, he returned to King's College, Cambridge to do a PhD in Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. Career Hauser is probably best known for his part in setting up Acorn Computers with Chris Curry in 1978. When Olivetti took control of Acorn in 1985 he became vice-president for research at Olivetti, in charge of laboratories in the US and Europe. In 1986, Hauser co- founded the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) in Cambridge with Andy Hopper, who became the laboratory's director. Hauser's role in Acorn was portrayed by Edward Baker-Duly in the BBC drama Micro Men. In 1988, Hauser left Olivetti to start the Active Book Company, investing ¬£1 million of his own money. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made by Acorn, which had kept its technology to itself, he demonstrated the Active Book to as many large companies as he could. AT&T; Corporation acquired Active Book and incorporated it into EO Personal Communicator in July 1991. Hauser became chief technical officer and chairman of EO Europe. EO folded on 29 July 1994. In 1990, Hauser was involved in spinning out Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) from Acorn. In 1993, Hauser set up Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd with Andy Hopper. The company was acquired by Conexant Systems on 1 March 2004. He founded NetChannel Ltd in June 1996 as a holding company to begin work on marketing the NetStation. NetChannel was sold to AOL in 1996. He claimed in the 1990s that the networking technology used for AppleTalk was based on the (unpatented) Cambridge Ring. In 1997 he co-founded Amadeus Capital Partners Ltd, a venture capital company, and in 1998 he co-founded Cambridge Network with David Cleevely and Alec Broers. In 2000, Plastic Logic was founded, with Hauser as chairman. On 14 June 2001, the Hauser-Raspe Foundation was registered as a charity by Hauser and Pamela Raspe to advance education. In August 2004, Amadeus Capital Partners led the Series B venture capital financing of Solexa, and Hauser joined its board of directors. Solexa developed a next-generation DNA sequencing technology which became the market leader; the company was sold to Illumina, Inc of San Diego in January 2007 for over $US600 million. In 2009, Hauser was announced as the first customer of the Illumina Personal Genome Sequencing service. As of 2009, Hauser is the head of the East Anglia Stem Cell research network.

A. Schwaller de Lubicz, The Temple In Man: Sacred Architecture and The Perfect Man (Inner Traditions paperback, 1981). Early life Ren√© Schwaller left home at the age of eighteen after having completed an apprenticeship with his father in pharmaceutical chemistry. Moving to Paris from Alsace to study modern chemistry and physics, he developed an interest in Alchemy, reading every alchemical text he could find including those by Paracelsus and Ramon Llull. He also developed an interest in painting and became the student of Matisse.Robert Lawlor, Translator's Preface to The Temple In Man. He was given the title \\"de Lubicz\\" in 1919 by the Lithuanian writer, mystic and diplomat Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz. He also wrote under the mystical name 'Aor', signifying \\"Light of the Higher Mind\\". He may have become a student of Theosophy and Syncretism, as those two concepts are extensively tackled in his books. Les Veilleurs Schwaller de Lubicz was the founder in 1919, with other members of the Theosophical Society, of the esoteric right-wing French group called Affranchis, that published a journal L'Affranchi-Hi√©rarchie, Fraternit√©, Libert√©, a monthly journal of art and philosophy, dealing with a spiritual and social renewal within the framework of a mystical political philosophy. Its president was Ren√© Bruyez. On 23 July 1919 the group dissolved and another group was formed in its place: Les Veilleurs (\\"the Vigilants\\"), to which (at least according to the historian Pierre Mariel) the young Rudolf Hess belonged. Its uniform consisted of a dark shirt, high-boots and riding- breeches, akin to the Sturmabteilung.Joscelyn Godwin, \\"Schwaller de Lubicz: les Veilleurs et la connexion Nazie\\", in Politica Hermetica, number 5, pages 101-108 (√âditions L'√Çge d'Homme, 1991).Joscelyn Godwin, Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival, pages 54-55 (Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996). . For Hess being a member of Les Veilleurs, Godwin cited Pierre Mariel, L'Europe pa√Øenne du XXe si√®cle, magie noire en Angleterre, tziganes, gitans et romanichels, l'Allemagne pa√Øenne (Paris, Gen√®ve: la Palatine, 1964). Les Veilleurs delivered its manifesto in December 1919, its politics conveyed through a series of letters called \\"Appeals\\" and signed by its members. The letter signed by \\"Aor\\" was addressed \\"To the Jews\\", where he advised all Jews to \\"go back home\\". The first issue of its journal, Veilleur, contained an anonymous anti-semitic article that first appeared in a Masonic journal from 1898. The artist Andr√© VandenBroeck in his memoirs and biography of Schwaller de Lubicz described him as anti-semitic,Andr√© VandenBroeck, Al-Kemi: Hermetic, Occult, Political and Private Aspects of R.A.Schwaller De Lubicz and Joscelyn Godwin commented \\"Schwaller de Lubicz was not sufficiently vindictive to persist in the course of action followed by Hess and Hitler, but nor was he sufficiently humane, it would seem, to regret his contribution to the currents of the time.\\"Joscelyn Godwin, \\"Schwaller de Lubicz: les Veilleurs et la connexion Nazie\\". In his biography of Schwaller de Lubicz, La Vie et loeuvre de Rene Schwaller de Lubicz,Erik Sabl√©, La vie et l'≈ìuvre de Ren√© Schwaller de Lubicz (√âditions Dervy, Paris, 2003). Erik Sable writes, \\"The feigned Nazi connections of de Lubicz, some purportedly claim, are spurious, unfounded, and totally without merit; which only exposes the shallow nature of those authors who succumb to the victor‚Äôs stories.\\" Suhalia Arcana from 17 to 20 of Egyptian Tarot Game created by Schwaller de Lubicz in Suhalia around 1926-27During the 1920s with his wife Isha, Schwaller de Lubicz established in Switzerland the Station Scientifique Suhalia, a research centre consisting of \\"laboratories for physics, chemistry, micro-photography and the manufacture of homeopathic tinctures was set up, along with an astronomical observatory, a machine shop, workshops for woodworking, blacksmithing, printing, weaving, rugmaking and glassmaking and a theater.\\" Deborah Lawlor, \\"R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and Nature Word\\", in R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Nature Word, page 52 (The Lindisfarne Press, 1982). Arcana 17 and 20 from Egyptian Tarot Schwaller de Lubicz reprinted in 2019 by Giordano Berti While there, Schwaller de Lubicz brought to a total whole his philosophical vision and in 1926 published his book L'Appel du Feu, where his \\"inspiration and higher intelligence is personified as 'Aor' (Hebrew for 'intellectual light').\\" Suhalia became the location where he began to \\"elaborate his philosophy of the evolution of consciousness.\\" Deborah Lawlor, page 63. In Suhalia, between 1926-27 Schwaller created an Egyptian Tarot Game consisting of 25 cards (originally in black and white), partly copied and partly inspired by Egyptian gods paintings. The Italian painter and musician Elmiro Celli and Lucie Lamy, daughter of Isha, are supposed to have contributed to the realization of this \\"game of life\\"; but the active participation of Isha in planning is not to be excluded, being a passionate Egyptologist and scholar of comparative religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism). Giordano Berti, Aaron Cheak, Ada Pavan, Egyptian Tarot by Schwaller de Lubicz, Quarto Inferiore - Bologna, 2019, p. 5-12. Egypt Schwaller de Lubicz lived in Egypt for twelve years,Aaron Cheak, (2011), University of Queensland, Light Broken Through the Prism of Life: Ren√© Schwaller de Lubicz and the Hermetic Problem of Salt, p477. studying the temples of Thebes in detail. He, with the French Egypologist Alexandre Varille, developed the symbolist approach to ancient Egypt.Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Oxford, (2001), vol. 1, p456. He argued that Egyptian temples were used for mystical initiations, and that their design incorporated symbolism expressing a belief system that combined religion, philosophy, art, and science.Dominic Montserrat, Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt, pp. 129, 196 (Routledge, 2000). He believed, for instance, that the Egyptians were aware of astronomical concepts like axial precession, which was reflected in their religious beliefs. He linked the astrological age of Gemini with the development of the dualistic themes in Egyptian religion, the age of Taurus with the bull god Apis, and the age of Aries with the god Amun, who was depicted as a ram. He also argued that the human form was the basis for ancient Egyptian architecture, and he equated parts of the temples with parts of the human body. His three-volume work The Temple in Man includes a drawing that compares the plan of Luxor Temple to the shape of a human skeleton.See picture here. Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince argue that these ideas were influenced by Schwaller de Lubicz's existing beliefs, such as Syncretism and Theosophy. Like many other esotericist figures, he believed that Egyptian civilization dated back much farther than conventional Egyptian chronology allows. Mainstream Egyptologists have largely ignored his claims or viewed them with hostility, although Erik Hornung points out that his survey of Luxor Temple contains information useful to anyone studying the temple today. He is an influential figure among the advocates of theories about ancient Egypt that challenge the conclusions of mainstream Egyptology‚Äîtheories that are sometimes labeled \\"alternative Egyptology\\". Many adherents of George Gurdjieff's Fourth Way find parallels in Schwaller de Lubicz's writings,The Quest, volume 6 (Theosophical Society In America, 1993). and he has been an inspiration to authors like John Anthony West, whose claims about the great age of the Great Sphinx of Giza are inspired by those of Schwaller de Lubicz, and Naomi Ozaniec.

Provel has a low melting point, and therefore has a gooey and almost buttery texture at room temperature. It is the traditional topping for St. Louis-style pizza. It is also often used in the preparation of cheese soup and served on salads, chicken, and the Gerber sandwich. Some restaurants use Provel for their pasta dishes with white sauce instead of the customary fresh Italian cheese and cream. Popular in the St. Louis area, Provel is rarely used elsewhere. Provel can, however, be purchased at Hy Vee grocery stores throughout the Midwest. According to former St. Louis Post-Dispatch food critic Joe Bonwich, Provel was invented specifically for St. Louis-style pizza more than a half-century ago by the downtown firm Costa Grocery (now Roma Grocery on the Hill, a primarily Italian St. Louis neighborhood), in collaboration with the Hoffman Dairy Company of Wisconsin (now part of Kraft Foods). Bonwich states that Provel was developed to meet perceived demand for a pizza cheese with a \\"clean bite\\": one that melts well but breaks off nicely when the diner bites down. Neither of Bonwich's sources at Kraft and Roma had a definitive answer for the origin of the name, although one popular theory is that it is a portmanteau of the words provolone and mozzarella, two of the cheeses for which it is substituted.STLtoday ‚Äì Entertainment ‚Äì Dining Another rumored name origin is that \\"Provel\\" comes from the name provolone, removing the \\"-one\\" as it is made up of more than one type of cheese.

It was formed in 1980 by Subhash Ghisingh with the objective of demanding a Gorkhaland state within India. Early history Part of the desire for independence stems from the notion that the Gurkhas are ethnically and culturally diverse from the rest of the population of West Bengal due to their roots within Nepali history. R. B. Rai describes the Darjeeling region as \\"social, political, and symbolic center\\" for all Indian Gorkhas, leading the movement to include the Nepali Language in the Indian constitution.‚Äù Other ethnic identities in the region such as the Lepchas, the indigenous population of the area, and the Bhutias are looked at by Gorkhas as holding minority status. Language is one of the main distinguishing factors between Gorkhas and others in the Darjeeling district as out of a total of around one million people living in the hills of Darjeeling, 90 percent speak Nepali. It is also important to note that the Nepali spoken in the Darjeeling district is distinct from that spoken outside of the Darjeeling region as it emerged as a combination of several different ‚Äúkura‚Äù or ‚ÄúGorkhali‚Äù dialects. The British went even further in helping establish Gorkhas as a distinct ethnic identity as they institutionalized their racial classification through military policy. Over time this led to an even stronger sense of ethnic identity. A sense of otherness for Indian born Nepali speakers may also have been a strong contributing factor for some in their motivation to gain independence from India. Indian born Nepali speakers were not considered Nepalis by other Nepali speakers, but were also looked at as foreigners by Indians. Some members of the Indian government such as ex-Prime Minister Morarji Desai who stated that if Indians wanted to speak Nepali that they should ‚ÄúGo to Nepal‚Äù clearly share this stance on the Nepali language. The tie between ethnic heritage and the Gorkha National Liberation Front is clearly represented in the flag‚Äôs use of the traditional sword of the Gorkha‚Äôs, the Kukri. A contributing factor to the push for an independent Gorkhaland beyond ethnic identity was an economic downturn brought on by corruption and mismanagement of resources in the Darjeeling region by the Indian government during post colonial rule. Although the region was recognized as having several valuable resources such as tea, lumber and tourism, misappropriation led to long periods of economic hardship. These circumstances of economic uncertainty mixed with ethnic identity conflicts made the region a potential site for unrest. Other political parties have also supported actions or conflicts by Gorkhaland movement members like the GNLF, such as the Kamtapur Progressive Party. The instability also leads to uncertainty pertaining to potential conflict between people living in the Hills and people living in the Plains. This uncertainty is especially relevant when considering the differences in language and ethic orientation in those separate spaces. During the 1980s, the GNLF led an intensive and often violent campaign for the creation of a separate Gorkhaland state in the Nepali-speaking areas of northern West Bengal (Darjeeling, Dooars and Terai). The movement reached its peak around 1985‚Äì1986. On 22 August 1988, the GNLF, under Subhash Ghisingh, signed the Darjeeling Hill Accord, which created the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) in exchange for the GNLF giving up its demand for Gorkhaland. Electoral history =State assembly= GNLF boycotted the West Bengal state assembly elections in 1991. In the assembly elections in 1996, 2001, and 2006, GNLF won three assembly seats, one each from Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong. =Lok Sabha= In 1989, GNLF candidate Inderjeet Khuller, a former journalist covering the Gorkhaland agitation and a close friend of Subhash Ghisingh, won the Darjeeling (Lok Sabha constituency) elections. GNLF supported Inderjeet as the Indian National Congress candidate in 1991, who won the Lok Sabha elections riding on GNLF support. GNLF boycotted the Lok Sabha elections in 1996, 1998, and 1999, which were won by CPI(M) candidates. Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the GNLF supported the Congress party candidate Dawa Narbula, who won with a big margin from the Darjeeling constituency. In the 2009 elections, GNLF was out of power in the hills and did not field any candidate or support any party and the Lok Sabha seat was won by Jaswant Singh of BJP with the support from GJMM. Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council The GNLF administered the DGHC with Subhash Ghisingh as the chairman of the council from 1988 to 2004 for three successive terms. Subhash Ghisingh was appointed the sole caretaker of the DGHC from 2005 to 2008 as no election for the DGHC was held. Sixth Schedule A Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) was signed between the Central Government, the State Government and the GNLF for the establishment of a Sixth Schedule tribal council called the Gorkha Hill Council in the DGHC area on 6 December 2005. After some initial support, there was widespread opposition to the Sixth Schedule council, led by leaders like Madan Tamang of ABGL. Downfall The DGHC elections were due in 2004. However, the government decided not to hold elections and instead made Subhash Ghisingh the sole caretaker of the DGHC till the Sixth Schedule council was established. Resentment among the former councillors of DGHC grew rapidly. Among them, Bimal Gurung, once the trusted aide of Ghising, decided to break away from the GNLF. Riding on a mass support for Prashant Tamang, an Indian Idol contestant from Darjeeling, Bimal quickly capitalised on the public support he received for supporting Prashant, and was able to overthrow Ghisingh from the seat of power. Ghising decided to shift residence to Jalpaiguri and GNLF lost most of its support and cadres to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, a new party headed by Bimal Gurung. West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections 2011 After lying in political hibernation for three years, GNLF chief Subhash Ghisingh announced that his party would contest the West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections in 2011. Subhash Ghisingh returned to Darjeeling on 8 April 2011 ahead of the assembly elections after three years of \\"exile\\". All the three GNLF candidates, Bhim Subba from Darjeeling, Prakash Dahal from Kalimpong and Pemu Chettri from Kurseong lost the elections held on 18 April 2011.

Berar Province, also known as the Hyderabad Assigned Districts, was a province in British India, ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad. After 1853 it was administered by the British, although the Nizam retained formal sovereignty over the province. Azam Jah, the eldest son of the 7th Nizam, held the title of Mirza-Baig (\\"Prince\\") of Berar. In 1881, the population of Berar was 2,672,673 Telugu, Urdu and Marathi language-speaking people. The total area of the territory was . After 1 October 1903, the administration of the province was placed under the Commissioner-General for the Central Provinces, as the Berar Division. In 1936 the territory was renamed as the Central Provinces and Berar, and its legislative assembly was established. The successor to Berar, with changed boundaries, is Amravati Division in Vidarbha region in Maharashtra. History =Background= Before the Mughal occupation, Berar was a part of the Nizam Shahi sultanate of Ahmadnagar. It was ceded to Emperor Akbar by Chand Bibi in 1596, who was unable to stand against the imperial forces led by Prince Mirza Murad. After this initial victory, Prince Mirza Murad settled in Berar, with Balapur as his headquarters. Near Balapur, he founded a new city named Shahpur, and constructed a beautiful palace for himself. As his relationship was deteriorating with Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, the commander of the army, Akbar recalled Khan-i-Khanan and sent his trusted friend Abul Fazl to help him. Mirza Murad died in 1598. After his death, Prince Daniel was given the charge as governor of Berar, Ahmadnagar, and Khandesh, and Khan-i- Khanan was sent along with Mirza Daniel. Akbar died in 1605. In 1611, the southern provinces of Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Khandesh defied Mughal sovereignty under Malik Ambar. Jahangir sent Man Singh and others to crush the revolt. Man Singh died a natural death on 6 July 1614 at Ellichpur. During Jahangir's rule, Malik Ambar, till his death in 1626, recovered a substantial part of the Deccan from the Mughals including Berar. In 1628, the first year of the reign of Shah Jahan (Mirza Khurram), Berar again came under the Mughal sway. In 1636, the Mughal possessions in Dakhin (Deccan) were divided into 4 Subahs. Berar Subah was one of them, with Ellichpur as its capital, and Gavilgad as its main fort. Aurangzeb was appointed Viceroy of the four Deccan Subahs for the first time, and he occupied the post for eight years (till 1644). He was again appointed viceroy for the second time in 1653, and he remained in that post till 1657. During Aurangzeb's reign, Mirza Azam was appointed at Berar, then Amir Qamaruddin Nizam (I) became the Viceroy of Berar. Berar was successively overrun by the Mughals after the Mughals appointed the Maratha Senapati Sawai Shri Shriman Santaji Bhonsle Seena Sahibe-E-Subah, because Santaji was the father-in-law of Mirza Bedarbakht, son of Mirza Azam, and grandson of Aurangzeb. Alamgeer, the Maratha Mughal, then appointed the Maratha rulers Shambhaji in 1680 and Rajaram in 1698. In 1720, Maratha Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath obtained the grant of the right to collect chauth and sardeshmukhi from Berar from the Mughal emperor. =Nizam & Maratha period= In 1724, the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asif Jah established the independent line of the Nizams of Hyderabad, and thenceforth the latter claimed to be de jure sovereigns of Berar, with exception of certain districts (Mehkar, Umarkhed, etc.) ceded to the Maratha Peshwa in 1760 and 1795. The claim was contested by the Maratha Bhonsla rajas of Nagpur, and for more than half a century the country was devastated by wars between the two. This condition of things was ended by Wellesley's victories at Assaye and Argaon (1803), which forced the Bhonsla raja to cede his territories south of Gawilgarh and Narnala Fort and east of the Wardha River. The forts of Gavilgad and Narnala remained subject to the Bhosale raja of Nagpur. By the partition treaty of Hyderabad (1804) between Nizam and the British, these ceded territories in Berar were transferred in perpetual sovereignty to the Nizam, together with some tracts about Sindkhed and Jalna, which had been held by Sindhia. The treaty of 1822 extinguished Maratha's right to levy tribute (chauth), the Wardha River was fixed as the eastern boundary of Berar, the Melghat and adjoining districts in the plains being assigned to the Nizam, in exchange for the districts east of the Wardha held by the Peshwa. Though Berar was no longer oppressed by its Maratha taskmasters, nor harried by Pindari and Bhil raiders, it remained long a prey to the turbulent elements let loose by the sudden cessation of the wars. From time to time bands of soldiers, whom the government was powerless to control, scoured the country, and rebellion upon rebellion till 1859, when the last fight against open rebels took place at Chichamba near Risod. =British Raj= At last, the British government intervened, and in 1853, a new treaty was signed with the Nizam, under which the Hyderabad contingent was to be maintained by the British government, while the pay of this force and in satisfaction of other claims, certain districts were assigned to the British East India Company. It was these \\"Hyderabad Assigned Districts\\" which were popularly supposed to form the province of Berar. In 1860, by a new treaty which modified in the Nizam's favor that of 1853, it was agreed that Berar should be held in trust by the British government for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853. Under British control, Berar rapidly recovered its prosperity. The American Civil War gave an immense stimulus to the cotton trade; the laying of a railway line across the province provided yet further employment, and the people rapidly became prosperous and contented. Yet building Berar's prosperity on cotton also came with a price. During the famine of 1900, for example, nearly 8.5% of the population died, \\"with the greatest number of deaths\\", according to the historian Sven Beckert, \\"occurring in districts most specialized in cotton production\\". Through an agreement signed on 5 November 1902, 6th Nizam Nawab Mir Mahbub Ali Khan leased Berar permanently to the British against an annual payment of 25 lakhs Rupees. Lord Curzon decided to merge Berar with the Central Provinces, and this was proclaimed on 17 September 1903. Thus the Central Provinces and Berar was born by a Residency Order, dated 30 September 1903, and the administration of Berar was placed under the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. On 1 October 1903, Berar was placed under the administration of the British Commissioner‚ÄìGeneral of the Central Provinces. In 1936, with the establishment of the legislative assembly of the \\"Central Provinces and Berar\\", the territory was renamed as the Central Provinces and Berar. Berar became known as Berar Division. Administration In 1853, after the administration of the province was assigned to the British East India Company by the Nizam following a treaty, it was divided into two districts, South Berar with its headquarters at Hingoli, and North Berar with its headquarters at Buldana. Both were placed under a deputy commissioner. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Hingoli and its adjoining areas were restored to the Nizam and the province was reconstituted into two districts, East Berar with its headquarters at Amraoti, and West Berar with its headquarters at Akola. In 1864, East Berar was divided into two districts: Amraoti and Southeast Berar (which was first renamed as Wun district and then in 1905, Yeotmal district), with headquarters at Yeotmal. In 1867, Ellichpur District was also carved out of Amraoti. In 1864, the talukas of Malkapur, Chikhli, and Mehkar were separated from the West Berar district, and a new district, Southwest Berar district, was formed, which was renamed as Mehkar district in 1865. In 1867, Buldana was selected as the headquarters of the district, and later the district was renamed as Buldana district. In 1868, Basim district was formed. Berar consisted of one Division with Commissioner and six districts viz. Amraoti, Ellichpur, Wun, Akola, Buldana, and Washim in 1905. It was rearranged into four districts of Amraoti, Yeotmal, Akola, and Buldhana. In 1869, municipal administrations were introduced at Amraoti, Akola, Ellichpur, Basim, Yavatmal, Khamgaon. Later, Shegaon (1881), Akot (1884), and by 1904, four more, became municipal towns.Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 7, page 411 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library Officers of Berar Province * Commissioner - Lt-Col W Hastings ** Deputy Commissioner ** A Godwin-Austen * Judicial Commissioner J K Batten ** Civil and Sessions Judge F W A Prideaux See also * Berar Sultanate * Berar Subah * Nizam of Hyderabad * Vidarbha References Category:Regions of Maharashtra Category:Provinces of British India Category:Berar Category:States and territories disestablished in 1903 Category:1724 establishments in India Category:Hyderabad State Category:History of Vidarbha ","title":"Berar Province"},{"id":"855055","text":"In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined. Creational design patterns are further categorized into object-creational patterns and Class-creational patterns, where Object-creational patterns deal with Object creation and Class-creational patterns deal with Class- instantiation. In greater details, Object-creational patterns defer part of its object creation to another object, while Class-creational patterns defer its object creation to subclasses. Five well-known design patterns that are parts of creational patterns are the * Abstract factory pattern, which provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying the objects' concrete classes. * Builder pattern, which separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. * Factory method pattern, which allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses. * Prototype pattern, which specifies the kind of object to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by cloning this prototype. * Singleton pattern, which ensures that a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. Definition The creational patterns aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They increase the system's flexibility in terms of the what, who, how, and when of object creation. Usage As modern software engineering depends more on object composition than class inheritance, emphasis shifts away from hard-coding behaviors toward defining a smaller set of basic behaviors that can be composed into more complex ones. Hard-coding behaviors are inflexible because they require overriding or re-implementing the whole thing in order to change parts of the design. Additionally, hard- coding does not promote reuse and makes it difficult to keep track of errors. For these reasons, creational patterns are more useful than hard-coding behaviors. Creational patterns make design become more flexible. They provide different ways to remove explicit references in the concrete classes from the code that needs to instantiate them. In other words, they create independency for objects and classes. Consider applying creational patterns when: * A system should be independent of how its objects and products are created. * A set of related objects is designed to be used together. * Hiding the implementations of a class library or product, revealing only their interfaces. * Constructing different representation of independent complex objects. * A class wants its subclass to implement the object it creates. * The class instantiations are specified at run-time. * There must be a single instance and client can access this instance at all times. * Instance should be extensible without being modified. Structure Creational Pattern class diagram. Below is a simple class diagram that most creational patterns have in common. Note that different creational patterns require additional and different participated classes. Participants: * Creator: Declares object interface. Returns object. * ConcreteCreator: Implements object's interface. Examples Some examples of creational design patterns include: * Abstract Factory pattern: a class requests the objects it requires from a factory object instead of creating the objects directly * Factory method pattern: centralize creation of an object of a specific type choosing one of several implementations * Builder pattern: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations * Dependency Injection pattern: a class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly * Lazy initialization pattern: tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed * Object pool pattern: avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use * Prototype pattern: used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects * Singleton pattern: restrict instantiation of a class to one object See also * Constructor * Behavioral pattern * Concurrency pattern * Structural pattern References Category:Software design patterns ","title":"Creational pattern"},{"id":"855056","text":"Osmotic Membrane Processes Forward osmosis (FO) is an osmotic process that, like reverse osmosis (RO), uses a semi-permeable membrane to effect separation of water from dissolved solutes. The driving force for this separation is an osmotic pressure gradient, such that a \\"draw\\" solution of high concentration (relative to that of the feed solution), is used to induce a net flow of water through the membrane into the draw solution, thus effectively separating the feed water from its solutes. In contrast, the reverse osmosis process uses hydraulic pressure as the driving force for separation, which serves to counteract the osmotic pressure gradient that would otherwise favor water flux from the permeate to the feed. Hence significantly more energy is required for reverse osmosis compared to forward osmosis. Family of osmotic membrane processes, including reverse osmosis and forward osmosisThe simplest equation describing the relationship between osmotic and hydraulic pressures and water (solvent) flux is: J_w = A \\\\left(\\\\Delta \\\\pi - \\\\Delta P \\\\right) where J_w is water flux, A is the hydraulic permeability of the membrane, ŒîœÄ is the difference in osmotic pressures on the two sides of the membrane, and ŒîP is the difference in hydrostatic pressure (negative values of J_w indicating reverse osmotic flow). The modeling of these relationships is in practice more complex than this equation indicates, with flux depending on the membrane, feed, and draw solution characteristics, as well as the fluid dynamics within the process itself. The solute flux (J_s) for each individual solute can be modelled by Fick's Law J_s = B \\\\Delta c Where B is the solute permeability coefficient and \\\\Delta c is the trans-membrane concentration differential for the solute. It is clear from this governing equation that a solute will diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This is well known in reverse osmosis where solutes from the feedwater diffuse to the product water, however in the case of forward osmosis the situation can be far more complicated. In FO processes we may have solute diffusion in both directions depending on the composition of the draw solution and the feed water. This does two things; the draw solution solutes may diffuse to the feed solution and the feed solution solutes may diffuse to the draw solution. Clearly these phenomena have consequences in terms of the selection of the draw solution for any particular FO process. For instance the loss of draw solution may affect the feed solution perhaps due to environmental issues or contamination of the feed stream, such as in osmotic membrane bioreactors. An additional distinction between the reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) processes is that the permeate water resulting from an RO process is in most cases fresh water ready for use. In the FO process, this is not the case. The membrane separation of the FO process in effect results in a \\"trade\\" between the solutes of the feed solution and the draw solution. Depending on the concentration of solutes in the feed (which dictates the necessary concentration of solutes in the draw) and the intended use of the product of the FO process, this step may be all that is required. The forward osmosis process is also known as osmosis or in the case of a number of companies who have coined their own terminology 'engineered osmosis' and 'manipulated osmosis'. Applications =Emergency drinks= Hydration bag before use One example of an application of this type may be found in \\"hydration bags\\", which use an ingestible draw solute and are intended for separation of water from dilute feeds. This allows, for example, the ingestion of water from surface waters (streams, ponds, puddles, etc.) that may be expected to contain pathogens or toxins that are readily rejected by the FO membrane. With sufficient contact time, such water will permeate the membrane bag into the draw solution, leaving the undesirable feed constituents behind. The diluted draw solution may then be ingested directly. Typically, the draw solutes are sugars such as glucose or fructose, which provide the additional benefit of nutrition to the user of the FO device. A point of additional interest with such bags is that they may be readily used to recycle urine, greatly extending the ability of a backpacker or soldier to survive in arid environments. This process may also, in principle, be employed with highly concentrated saline feedwater sources such as seawater, as one of the first intended uses of FO with ingestible solutes was for survival in life rafts at sea. =Desalination= Modern Water's containerised forward osmosis desalination plant at Al Khaluf, Oman Desalinated water can be produced from the diluted draw / osmotic agent solution, using a second process. This may be by membrane separation, thermal method, physical separation or a combination of these processes. The process has the feature of inherently low fouling because of the forward osmosis first step, unlike conventional reverse osmosis desalination plants where fouling is often a problem. Modern Water has deployed forward osmosis based desalination plants in Gibraltar and Oman. In March 2010, National Geographic magazine cited forward osmosis as one of three technologies that promised to reduce the energy requirements of desalination. =Evaporative cooling tower ‚Äì make-up water= Simple diagram of forward osmosis applied to the production of make-up water for evaporative coolingOne other application developed, where only the forward osmosis step is used, is in evaporative cooling make-up water. In this case the cooling water is the draw solution and the water lost by evaporation is simply replaced using water produced by forward osmosis from a suitable source, such as seawater, brackish water, treated sewage effluent or industrial waste water. Thus in comparison with other ‚Äòdesalination‚Äô processes that may be used for make-up water the energy consumption is a fraction of these with the added advantage of the low fouling propensity of a forward osmosis process.P. Nicoll Manipulated Osmosis ‚Äì an alternative to Reverse Osmosis? Climate Control Middle East, April 2011, 46‚Äì49 =Landfill leachate treatment= In the case where the desired product is fresh water that does not contain draw solutes, a second separation step is required. The first separation step of FO, driven by an osmotic pressure gradient, does not require a significant energy input (only unpressurized stirring or pumping of the solutions involved). The second separation step, however does typically require energy input. One method used for the second separation step is to employ RO. This approach has been used, for instance, in the treatment of landfill leachate. An FO membrane separation is used to draw water from the leachate feed into a saline (NaCl) brine. The diluted brine is then passed through a RO process to produce fresh water and a reusable brine concentrate. The advantage of this method is not a savings in energy, but rather in the fact that the FO process is more resistant to fouling from the leachate feed than a RO process alone would be.R. J. York, R. S. Thiel and E. G. Beaudry, Full-scale experience of direct osmosis concentration applied to leachate management, Sardinia ‚Äô99 Seventh International Waste Management and Landfill Symposium, S. Margherita di Pula, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, 1999. A similar FO/RO hybrid has been used for the concentration of food products, such as fruit juice. =Brine concentration= Oasys FO Pilot System Brine concentration using forward osmosis may be achieved using a high osmotic pressure draw solution with a means to recover and regenerate it. One such process uses the ammonia-carbon dioxide (NH3/CO2) forward osmosis process invented at Yale University by Rob McGinnis, who subsequently founded Oasys Water to commercialize the technology. Because ammonia and carbon dioxide readily dissociate into gases using heat, the draw solutes can effectively be recovered and reused in a closed loop system, achieving separation through the conversion between thermal energy and osmotic pressure. NH3/CO2 FO brine concentration is was initially demonstrated in the oil and gas industry to treat produced water in the Permian Basin area of Texas, and is currently being used in power and manufacturing plants in China.Water Desalination Report, \\"FO process concentrates oilfield brine\\" . Published October 8, 2012 =Feed water 'softening' / pre-treatment for thermal desalination= Forward osmosis based feedwater pre-treatment for multi stage flash distillation One unexploited application is to 'soften' or pre-treat the feedwater to multi stage flash (MSF) or multiple effect distillation (MED) plants by osmotically diluting the recirculating brine with the cooling water. This reduces the concentrations of scale forming calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate compared to the normal process, thus allowing an increase in top brine temperature (TBT), output and gained output ratio (GOR). Darwish et al. showed that the TBT could be raised from 110 ¬∞C to 135 ¬∞C whilst maintaining the same scaling index for calcium sulphate. =Osmotic power= Simple PRO power generation scheme In 1954 Pattle suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‚Äò70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb and independently by Jellinek was outlined. This process was referred by Loeb as pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and one simplistic implementation is shown opposite. Some situations that may be envisaged to exploit it are using the differential osmotic pressure between a low brackish river flowing into the sea, or brine and seawater. The worldwide theoretical potential for osmotic power has been estimated at 1,650 TWh / year. Statkraft PRO pilot plant In more recent times a significant amount of research and development work has been undertaken and funded by Statkraft, the Norwegian state energy company. A prototype plant was built in Norway generating a gross output between 2 ‚Äì 4 kW; see Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum. A much larger plant with an output of 1 ‚Äì 2 MW at Sunndals√∏ra, 400 km north of Oslo was considered but was subsequently dropped. The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO) in Japan is funding work on osmotic power. Industrial usage =Advantages= Forward osmosis (FO) has many positive aspects in the treating of industrial effluents containing many different kinds of contaminants and also in the treating of salty waters. When these draw effluents have moderate to low concentrations of removable agents, the FO membranes are really efficient and have the flexibility of adapting the membrane depending on the quality desired for the product water. FO systems are also really useful when using them combined with other kinds of treatment systems as they compensate the deficiencies that the other systems may have. This is also helpful in processes where the recovery of a certain product is essential to minimize costs or to improve efficiency such as biogas production processes. =Disadvantages= The main disadvantage of the FO processes is the high fouling factor that they may experience. This occurs when treating a high saturated draw effluent, resulting in the membrane getting obtruded and no longer making its function. This implies that the process has to be stopped and the membrane cleaned. This issue happens less in other kind of membrane treatments as they have artificial pressure forcing to trespass the membrane reducing the fouling effect. Also there‚Äôs an issue with the yet to be developed membranes technology. This affects to the FO processes as the membranes used are expensive and not highly efficient or ideal for the desired function. This means that many times other cheaper and simpler systems are used rather than membranes. =Industrial market and future= Currently the industry uses few FO membranes processes (and membranes technologies in general) as they‚Äôre complex processes which are also expensive and require a lot of cleaning procedures and that sometimes only work under certain conditions that in industry can‚Äôt always be ensured. For that reason the focus for the future in membranes is to improve the technology so it‚Äôs more flexible and suitable for general industrial usage. This will be done by investing in research and by slowly getting these developments into the market so the production cost is lowered as more membranes are produced. Keeping with the current development it can be ensured that in few years from now, membranes will be spread-used in many different industrial processes (not only water treatments) and that there will appear many fields where FO processes can be used. Research An area of current research in FO involves direct removal of draw solutes, in this case by means of a magnetic field. Small (nanoscale) magnetic particles are suspended in solution creating osmotic pressures sufficient for the separation of water from a dilute feed. Once the draw solution containing these particles has been diluted by the FO water flux, they may be separated from that solution by use of a magnet (either against the side of a hydration bag, or around a pipe in-line in a steady state process).

1624 or 1625) was an Italian organist, music theorist, and composer. He was famous as a teacher, for his treatise Il Transilvano (Venice, 1st part 1593; 2nd part 1609-10) on counterpoint, and for his part in the development of keyboard technique, particularly on the organ. He was born in Deruta, near Perugia. Biography Diruta was born in Deruta in 1546 c. He became a friar minor conventual in the convent Perugia in 1566; later, from 1569 to 1574, he was in the convent of Correggio. Around 1578 he moved to Venice, where he met Claudio Merulo, Gioseffo Zarlino and Costanzo Porta (who was also a friar minor conventual), and he probably studied with each of them. Merulo mentioned Diruta in a prefatory letter to the Transilvano (1593), as one of his finest students. From 1580 until 1585 he was organist at the Gubbio cathedral. He returned in Venice at the Frari convent, where he was organist from 1586 until 1589. By 1593 he was organist at Chioggia cathedral. In these year he dedicated the first part of his treatise Il Transilvano to Sigismund Bathory, prince of Transylvania. Later he returned to live in Umbria. He was again organist at the Gubbio cathedral from 1604 to 1610. In 1610 from Gubbio he dedicated the second part of his treatise Il Transilvano to Leonora Orsini Sforza, niece of Grand Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany. He died in Deruta in 1624 or 1625. His nephew Agostino Diruta (c. 1595 - c. 1647) was also a composer, and his pupil.See the German Wikipedia entry on Agostino Diruta; dates from Grove 6 as quoted by RISM online. Works Diruta's major work is a treatise in two parts on organ playing, counterpoint, and composition, entitled Il Transilvano (The Transylvanian) published for the first time in 1593; it is in the form of a dialog with Istvan de Jos√≠ka, a diplomat from Transylvania whom Diruta met during one of Jos√≠ka's missions to Italy. It is one of the first practical discussions of organ technique which differentiates organ technique from keyboard technique on other instruments. His fingerings largely follow the usual ones of his times: for example, his fingering for a C major scale never includes the thumb, and crosses the middle finger over the ring finger: his work is one of the earliest attempts in Italy to establish consistency in keyboard fingering. As a contrapuntist, Diruta anticipates Fux in describing the different \\"species\\" of counterpoint: note against note, two notes against one, suspensions, four notes against one, and so forth. Unlike Fux, he defines a less-rigorous kind of counterpoint that was adequate for improvisation; for example it neither requires contrary motion nor prohibits successive perfect consonances. It describes contemporary keyboard practice well, as can be observed from the contemporary toccatas and canzonas of composers such as Merulo. Diruta included many of his own compositions in Il Transilvano, and they are mostly didactic in nature, showing different kinds of figuration, and presenting different kinds of performance problems. These four toccate are among the earliest examples of the etude. The Prima parte also includes toccatas by other composers of the time, chosen for their musical and didactic value: Claudio Merulo, Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni Gabrieli, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Antonio Romanini, Paolo Quagliati, Vincenzo Bellavere and Gioseffo Guami. The Seconda parte includes ricercares by Luzzaschi, Gabriele Fattorini and Adriano Banchieri.

Costanzo Porta (1528 or 1529 - 19 May 1601) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance, and a representative of what is known today as the Venetian School. He was highly praised throughout his life both as a composer and a teacher, and had a reputation especially as an expert contrapuntist.Lilian P. Pruett, Grove online Biography Porta was born in Cremona. Details of his early life are slim, but he probably was educated at the Convent Porta San Luca in Cremona. Around 1550 he is thought to have studied with Adrian Willaert, who was maestro di cappella at St. Mark's in Venice; while he was there he met Claudio Merulo, who was also a student; they remained close friends throughout their lives. In 1552 Porta became maestro di cappella at Osimo Cathedral; in 1565 he took a position in Padua briefly, but took a more important position in Ravenna the next year, where he was hired to build an entirely new music practice at the cathedral. By 1580 his services were much in demand, and there was competition for him; he declined an offer from Milan, moving instead between positions in several cities. In addition he had become a renowned teacher by this time, and numerous composers of the next generation learned their contrapuntal skills from Porta. His last years were spent in Padua, and they were clearly difficult. Musical standards there began to decline, and he faced in addition the burden of ill health and the jealousy of the man who was eventually to replace him. He died in Padua. He is buried in the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. Style Most of Porta's output is sacred music, especially motets. He published at least eight books of motets, one of which is lost, as well as books of masses, introits, and a huge cycle of hymns for Vespers. Porta's music is even more polyphonic than that of Gombert, and he showed a liking for academic, even severe contrapuntal devices, although they are used so skillfully that the text can always be clearly understood. Often his music uses strict canons; one motet from his book of 52 motets from 1580, in seven voices, has no less than four of the voices entirely derived canonically. Another motet from this same book is a mensuration canon, that most difficult of all contrapuntal forms to carry off. While many composers were reacting to the strictures of the Council of Trent against excessive polyphonic practice, Porta evidently felt unobliged to follow them; perhaps he had sufficient confidence in his skill in conveying the text. His music is as carefully controlled as that of Palestrina, with cautious use of dissonance and chromaticism, while displaying polyphonic virtuosity to a degree uncommon in other composers of sacred music at the end of the 16th century. Some of the later motets use polychoral writing extensively. Although Porta was not in Venice in the late part of the century, where this style had become famous (see Venetian polychoral style), he had spent years there as a student studying with Willaert, and the influence clearly lasted throughout his life. Most likely he was familiar with the current practice in Venice, and adopted some of the innovations which worked best with his highly learned style. Porta also wrote madrigals. Many of these were clearly intended for specific occasions, such as weddings and large social events in the families of his employers; they are in a much simpler style than his sacred works, much in keeping with contemporary practice.

Construction and commissioning Morris was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7 June 1938; launched on 1 June 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Charles R. Nutter, great-granddaughter of Commodore Morris; and commissioned on 5 March 1940, with Commander Harry B. Jarrett in command. Service history Morris, flagship of Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon 2), followed her shakedown with routine training schedules until the summer of 1941 when she joined the North Atlantic Patrol. With the entry of the United States into World War II, she entered Charleston Navy Yard, where she was equipped with the first fire control radar for a destroyer. By 3 January 1942, she was underway for Pearl Harbor, rejoining her squadron there at the end of February. Attached to Task Force 17 (TF 17), the destroyer sailed on 16 March for Noumea, and into her first major enemy engagement, the Battle of the Coral Sea. Prior to the battle, she guarded the carriers of the task force as their planes struck at enemy shipping in Tulagi Harbor and in the Louisiade Archipelago. From 4‚Äì8 May, she splashed one enemy plane and damaged two while screening and , and when the latter was heavily damaged, pulled alongside to rescue some 500 survivors. Damage received during the rescue forced her back to Pearl Harbor where hurried repairs put her back into condition for the Battle of Midway a month later. In that action she again pulled alongside Yorktown to rescue over 500 survivors. Morriss next action came in late August, when she joined TF 61 in support of the Guadalcanal Campaign. For the next 2 months, she screened carriers and patrolled among the Solomon Islands. On 25 October, following a 3-day independent sweep through the Gilbert Islands, she rejoined TF 17 and took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. During the action, she destroyed six aircraft and once more came to the rescue of , from which she took on 550 survivors. As in other rescue operations her superstructure was damaged, but, after repairs at Espiritu Santo, she was back in the Guadalcanal area, first operating with and then as supply unit escort to . In May 1943, Morris departed the southern Pacific and sailed north to support the capture and occupation of Attu Island and Kiska, the Aleutian end of the Japanese ribbon defense. Then she returned to San Francisco, California for a 7-week overhaul. In November, she again joined an air support group escorting , , and in the Gilberts offensive, during which she went to aid Liscome Bay. As the task forces pressed further into the central Pacific, Morris sailed with them into the Marshall Islands. On 30 January 1944, she led a column of warships in a shore bombardment mission against Wotje Atoll. Thence she steamed to Kwajalein Atoll, where, while providing close fire support off Namur, she wiped out a Japanese counterattack force from an adjacent island. In mid-February she departed Kwajalein and moved with TG 51.11 to support the seizure and occupation of Eniwetok. Arriving on 17 February, she continued carrier operations until 24 February, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor. Morris returned to combat in April 1944, when as a unit of the 7th Fleet she took part in all the western New Guinea landings, beginning with Hollandia. In May and June she give fire support in the Toem-Wakde-Sarmi areas and then during the Biak Island operation. In July, she went against enemy guns on Noemfoor Island and then at Cape Sansapor. In August, she participated in operations against Halmahera and Morotai and then began preparations for the initial invasion of the Philippines. On 16 October, with TG 8.6, she got underway for Leyte Gulf. Safely delivering her charges, transports with the first reinforcement groups aboard, on the 21st, she took up anti-aircraft station and, for several days, experienced meetings with the newest Japanese tactics: the kamikaze. Throughout the next month she continued to escort troops and supplies to Leyte. With the dawn of the new year, 1945, she was en route north for the Luzon operations. Arriving within the week she participated in pre-invasion bombardment and then provided fire support during the landings on 9 January. For 18 days she patrolled, bombarded shore positions, and fought off kamikazes. Detached from the 7th Fleet after Luzon, Morris rejoined the 5th Fleet and prepared for Okinawa. On 1 April, she arrived off Kerama Retto with TG 51.11. For the next 5 days, she escorted transports and oilers and cruised in various assigned sectors on antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 6 April, while patrolling station A-11, a Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\", carrying either a heavy bomb or torpedo, closed in on her. Morriss guns scored hits and set the plane afire, but could not stop it. Shortly after 1815, it crashed into the ship on the portside, between the Nos. 1 and 2 guns. Fires caused by the explosions spread quickly. Two hours were needed to bring them under control with another 30 minutes to extinguish them. Morris then returned to Kerama Retto where temporary repairs somewhat corrected her demolished bow and subsequent draft of 18 feet 3 inches, her large protrusion of plating on the starboard side, and her damaged steering. The ship suffered 13 dead, 45 wounded.R.Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p 214 On 22 May, she started out across the Pacific, and on 18 June entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Declared neither seaworthy nor habitable, she was decommissioned on 9 November. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November, she was stripped of gear and sold to Franklin Shipwrecking on 2 August 1947, then resold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation in Los Angeles, California on 17 July 1949, where she was scrapped.

He was born in Correggio and died in Parma. Born Claudio Merlotti, he Latinised his surname (meaning little blackbird) when he became famous in Venetian cultural clubs. Life Little is known about his early life except that he studied in Correggio with Tuttovale Menon, a famous madrigalist who also worked in the Ferrara court; he also studied with Girolamo Donato, an organist. It is likely that he studied with Zarlino at St. Mark's in Venice. While in Venice he became close friends with Costanzo Porta, a friendship which was to endure for his entire life. On 21 October 1556, he was appointed organist at Old Cathedral of Brescia (Duomo Vecchio), and his skill as an organist must have been impressive, because he became organist at St. Mark's, one of the most prestigious positions for an organist in Italy, in 1557; he was selected over a list of candidates that included Andrea Gabrieli. This was the first important event of his career, and he was considered to be the finest organist in Italy. It is important to note that in St. Mark's there were two organs, and two separate organists were appointed to play them: in 1557 Merulo was appointed to the second, smaller organ, while Annibale Padovano remained at the post of first organist. After Padovano's hurried departure from Venice in 1566, Merulo was appointed to the first organ, and Andrea Gabrieli became the second organist. He was appointed as ambassador of Venetian Republic at the marriage of Franceso de‚Äô Medici and Bianca Cappello in 1579 and wrote music of celebration for Henry III of France, who visited Venice in 1574. In 1584, he suddenly left this position in Venice. The reasons for this are unclear, and somewhat surprising; in Venice he was well-paid, and had a very good reputation; and St. Mark's was one of the most important places for an organist. However, in December 1584 his name appears in payment register of Farnesia Court of Parma. In 1587 he was appointed as organist in Parma Cathedral and from 1591 also in Church of Santa Maria della Steccata. While here, he requested improvements to the organ, carried out by Costanzo Antegnati, the last heir of the great Brescian family of organ makers. We can deduce that Merulo used the Steccata's organ for his proofs of new composition, based on his Venetian experience, and continued to compose in this style. He lived in Parma until his death. During this period, he made several trips in Venice and Rome, where he published his famous two volume Toccate per organo. Merulo died in Parma on 4 May 1604 and was buried in Parma Cathedral near to the tomb of Cipriano de Rore. He left a daughter and his wife Amabilia Banzola. Music and influence Merulo is famous for his keyboard music. His Toccatas, in particular, are innovative; he was the first to contrast sections of contrapuntal writing with passageworks; often he inserts sections which could be called ricercars into pieces which otherwise are labelled toccatas or canzonas. (In the late 16th century, these terms are only approximately descriptive; different composers clearly had different ideas of what they meant). Often his keyboard pieces begin as though they are to be a transcription of vocal polyphony, but then gradually add embellishment and elaboration until they reach a climactic passage of considerable virtuosity. Sometimes, especially in his later music, he develops ornaments which acquire the status of a motif, which is then used developmentally; this anticipates a principal generative technique in the Baroque era. Often Merulo casually ignores the \\"rules\\" of voice-leading, giving the music an expressive intensity more associated with the late school of madrigalists than with keyboard music of the time. His keyboard music was hugely influential, and his ideas can be seen in the music of Sweelinck, Frescobaldi and others; because of the immense influence of Sweelinck as a teacher, much of the virtuoso keyboard technique of the north German organ school, culminating in Johann Sebastian Bach, can claim to be descended from the innovations of Merulo. Even though the fame of his instrumental music has overshadowed much of his a cappella vocal output, Merulo was also a madrigalist. Since he was a member of what is known today as the Venetian School, he also wrote motets for double choir in the manner of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. He published two books of Madrigali a 5 voices (1566 and 1604), one of Madrigali a 4 (1579) and a 3 (1580). The famous essay of keyboard technique Il Transilvano (1593), by Girolamo Diruta, was dedicated to Merulo, indicating his status as one of the most important keyboard players of the Italian Renaissance.

The class is a development class governed by the 2.4mR rule. The rule is controlled by World Sailing (ISAF) since it is one of few classes designated as an International class. The class rule is closely related to the 12mR rule that was used in the America's Cup and the shape often resembles the larger sister. While there is a small but active group of amateur designer/builders around the world, around 90% of boats are the commercially produced Norlin Mark III designed by yacht designer Peter Norlin of Sweden. Recently, new designs have come into production, such as the Stradivari III and the Proton. The boat is primarily used for racing and the class holds highly competitive national events in many countries. World and European championships (only when the World Championship is not in Europe) are attracting around 100 boats every year. In some countries, it features mainly as a class for sailors with a disability. The 2.4mR is ideal for adapted sailing since the sailor does not move in the boat, and everything is adjustable from right in front of the sailor. Both hand- steering and foot-steering are possible. The boat's ability in integrated sailing has been proven on the result lists of several World Championships. In 2002 and 2005 there were handicapped World Champions. The boat is sailed without a spinnaker, but with a whisker-pole for the jib. History After the 1980 America's Cup, people in the Newport, RI area started sailing boats called Mini-12s named for the 12-Metre yachts used in the America's Cup. As the class developed, word of it spread to Sweden, home of yacht designer Peter Norlin. Norlin tweaked the design, and along with other naval architects, he created the 2.4-meter yacht class. Although the 2.4mR is a construction class, Peter Norlin is in practice the totally dominating designer, and the class is therefore often mistaken as a one-design class. In addition to all the sailing aspects of the boat, Norlin has worked the design to incorporate features for the physically disabled to use the boat. One-design In recent years attempts have been made to develop a one-design class based on the Norlin III. This is primarily because of the need for competition within the Paralympics for racing to be about the sailor and not a technical development race. This led to the introduction of (Appendix K to the Class rules) and now a group is working on a set of stand-alone One-design rules. This is still at the early stages but it is likely a new one-design class is formed alongside the development class. Rating formula As an open class rather than a one- design, all boat designs must meet the following formula. : \\\\frac{L + 2d + \\\\sqrt{S} - F}{2.37} \\\\leq 2.4 \\\\mbox{ metres} Where (all measurements in mm) * L = the \\"corrected\\" length of the hull (see rule D.6.3) * d = the midship girth difference (see rule D.6.4) * F = the average freeboard height (see rule D.6.5) * S = the total rated area of the mainsail and jib combined. Events =World Championships= =Para World Sailing Championships= The 2.4 metre has been used a number of times as equipment for the One-Person Technical Disabled discipline which holds an annual World Championships. =Paralympics= Since 2000 the 2.4 Metre has been the official single-crew class boat for sailing at the Summer Paralympics although it has been used in a more one design form utilising the Norlin Mk3 design.

Quietism was considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church, and she was imprisoned from 1695 to 1703 after publishing the book A Short and Very Easy Method of Prayer. Early life and marriage Guyon was the daughter of Claude Bouvier, a procurator of the tribunal of Montargis, 110 kilometers south of Paris and 70 kilometers east of Orl√©ans. Of a sensitive and delicate constitution, she was sickly in her childhood and her education was neglected. Her childhood was spent between the convent, and the home of her well-to-do parents, moving nine times in ten years. Guyon's parents were very religious people, and they gave her an especially pious training. Other important impressions from her youth that remained with her came from reading the works of St. Francis de Sales, and from certain nuns, her teachers. Prior to her marriage she had wanted to become a nun, but this desire did not last long.D√©gert, Antoine. \\"Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de la Motte-Guyon.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 May 2019 In 1664, when she was 15 years old, after turning down many other proposals, she was forced into an arranged marriage to a wealthy gentleman of Montargis, Jacques Guyon, aged thirty eight. During her twelve years of marriage, Guyon suffered terribly at the hands of her mother- in-law and maidservant. Adding to her misery were the deaths of her half- sister, followed by her mother, and her son. Her daughter and father then died within days of each other in July 1672. Guyon retained belief in God's perfect plan and that she would be blessed in suffering. She bore another son and daughter shortly before her husband's death in 1676. After twelve years of an unhappy marriage (in which she had borne five children, of whom three had survived), Madame Guyon had become a widow at the age of 28. During her marriage, Guyon became introduced to mysticism by Fr. Fran√ßois La Combe, a Barnabite, and was instructed by him. Life after marriage Mme Guyon After her husband's death, Madame Guyon initially lived quietly as a wealthy widow in Montargis. In 1679, she re-established contact with Fran√ßois La Combe, the superior of the Barnabite house in Thonon in Savoy. After a third mystical experience in 1680, Madame Guyon felt herself drawn to Geneva. The Bishop of Geneva, Jean d‚ÄôArenthon d‚ÄôAlex, persuaded her to use her money to set up a house for ‚Äúnew Catholics‚Äù in Gex, in Savoy, as part of broader plans to convert Protestants in the region. In July 1680, Madame Guyon left Montargis with her young daughter and travelled to Gex. The project was problematic, however, and Madame Guyon clashed with the sisters who were in charge of the house. The Bishop of Geneva sent Father La Combe to intervene. At this point, Guyon introduced La Combe to a mysticism of interiority. While her daughter was in an Ursuline convent in Thonon as a pensioner, Madame Guyon continued in Gex, experiencing illness and great difficulties, including opposition from her family. She gave over guardianship of her two sons to her mother-in-law and took leave of her personal possessions, although keeping a sizeable annuity for herself. Because of her ideas on mysticism, the Bishop of Geneva, who had at first viewed her coming with pleasure, asked her to leave his diocese, and at the same time he expelled Father Lacombe, who was then went to Vercelli. Madame Guyon followed her director to Turin, then returned to France and stayed at Grenoble, where she spread her religious convictions more widely with the publication of \\"Moyen court et facile de faire oraison\\" in January 1685. The Bishop of Grenoble, Cardinal Le Camus, was perturbed by the appeal her ideas aroused and she left the city at his request, rejoining Lacombe at Vercelli. In July the following year the pair returned to Paris, where Madame Guyon set about to gain adherents for her mystical vision. The timing was ill- chosen; Louis XIV, who had recently been exerting himself to have the Quietism of Molinos condemned at Rome, was by no means pleased to see gaining ground, even in his own capital, a form of mysticism which, to him, resembled that of Molinos in many of its aspects. By his order Lacombe was shut up in the Bastille, and afterwards in the castles of Oloron and of Lourdes. The arrest of Madame Guyon, delayed by illness, followed on 29 January 1688, brought about, she claimed, by Father de La Motte, her brother and a Barnabite. She was not released until seven months later, after she had placed in the hands of the theologians, who had examined her book, a retraction of the propositions which it contained. Some days later she met, at Beyne, in the Duchess de B√©thune-Charrost's country house, her cousin, Fran√ßois F√©nelon, who was to be the most famous of her supporters. F√©nelon was deeply impressed by her piety.Letters from Baron Van Hugel to a Niece, edited with an introduction by Gwendolen Greene‚Äîfirst published in 1928, p. 110 Through Fenelon, the influence of Madame Guyon reached and influenced religious circles powerful at court‚Äîthe Beauvilliers, the Chevreuses, the Montemarts‚Äîwho followed his spiritual guidance. Madame de Maintenon and, through her, the young ladies of Saint-Cyr, were soon won over to the new mysticism.\\"Madame Guyon\\" CCEL This was at the height of Madame Guyon's influence, most of all when F√©nelon was appointed on 18 August 1688 to be the tutor to the Duke of Burgundy, the king's grandson. Before long, however, the Bishop of Chartres, in whose diocese Saint-Cyr was located, took alarm at the spiritual ideas which were spreading there. Warned by him, Madame de Maintenon sought the advice of persons whose piety and wisdom she valued, and these advisers were unanimous in their rejection of Madame Guyon's ideas. Madame Guyon then asked for an examination of her conduct and her writings by civil and ecclesiastical judges. The king consented that her writings should be submitted to the judgment of Bossuet, Louis-Antoine, Cardinal de Noailles, and of Tronson, superior of the Society of Saint-Sulpice. After a certain number of secret conferences held at Issy, where Tronson was detained by a sickness, the commissioners presented in thirty-four articles the principles of Catholic teaching as to spirituality and the interior life (four of these articles were suggested by F√©nelon, who in February had been nominated to the Archbishopric of Cambrai). But on 10 October 1694 Fran√ßois de Harlay de Champvallon, the Archbishop of Paris, who had been excluded from the conferences at Issy, anticipated their results by condemning the published works of Madame Guyon. She, fearing another arrest, took refuge for some months at Meaux, with the permission of Bossuet who was the presiding bishop there. After placing in his hands her signed submission to the thirty-four articles of Issy, she returned secretly to Paris. At Paris, the police, however, arrested her on 24 December 1695 and imprisoned her, first at Vincennes, then in a convent at Vaugirard, and then in the Bastille, where on 23 August 1699 she again signed a retraction of her theories and promised to refrain from spreading them further. From that time on she took no part, personally, in public discussions, but the controversy about her ideas only grew all the more heated between Bossuet and F√©nelon. Madame Guyon remained imprisoned in the Bastille until 21 March 1703, when, after more than seven years of her final captivity, she went to live with her son in a village in the Diocese of Blois. There she passed some fifteen years surrounded by a stream of pilgrims, many from England and Scotland, and spending her time writing volumes of correspondence and poetry.James, Nancy C. Pure Love of Madame Guyon, (University Press of America, 2007), p98. She continued to be revered by the Beauvilliers, the Chevreuses, and F√©nelon, who never failed to communicate with her whenever safe and discreet intermediaries were available. Among the pilgrims, Milord Chewinkle stayed in Blois with Guyon for 7 years. One visitor, Pierre Poiret, went on to publish many of Guyon's works. One of her greatest works, published in 1717 by Pierre Poiret ‚Äì Ame Amante de son Dieu, represent√©e dans les emblems de Hermannus Hugo sur ses pieux desirs ‚Äì features her poetry written in response to the striking and popular emblem images of the Jesuit Herman Hugo and the Flemish master Otto von Veen.James, Nancy C. The Soul, Lover of God, (University Press of America, 2014) Guyon herself states that she took these emblems into the Bastille.James, Nancy C. and Voros, Sharon D., Bastille Witness, (University Press of America, 2011) Beliefs about prayer Guyon believed that one should pray at all times, and that one should devote all one's time to God. \\"Prayer is the key of perfection and of sovereign happiness; it is the efficacious means of getting rid of all vices and of acquiring all virtues; for the way to become perfect is to live in the presence of God. He tells us this Himself: 'walk before Me and be blameless' . Prayer alone can bring you into His presence, and keep you there continually.\\"Guyon. Le Moyen Court Et Autres √âcrits Spirituels (The Short and Easy Method of Prayer), (1685) As she wrote in one of her poems: \\"There was a period when I chose a time and place for prayer. ... But now I seek that constant prayer, in inward stillness known ...\\" Grace vs. works In the Christian dispute regarding grace and works, Guyon defended the belief that salvation is the result of grace rather than works. Like St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Calvin, and Martin Luther, she thought that a person's deliverance can only come from God as an outside source, never from within the person himself or herself. As a result of His own free will, God bestows his favour as a gift. In her autobiography, for example, Madame Guyon criticized self-righteous people who try to gain heaven through their works. She praised lowly sinners who merely submitted themselves to God's will. Of the so-called righteous, she wrote: \\"the righteous person, supported by the great number of works of righteousness he presumes to have done, seems to hold his salvation in his own hands, and regards heaven as the recompense due to his merits.‚Ä¶ His Saviour is, for him, almost useless. \\"These 'righteous persons' expect God to save them as a reward for their good works.\\" In contrast to the self- sufficient, \\"righteous\\" egoists, the sinners who have selflessly submitted to God \\"are carried swiftly by the wings of love and confidence into the arms of their Saviour, who gives them gratuitously what He has infinitely merited for them\\". God's \\"bounties are effects of His will, and not the fruits of our merits.\\" Death and influence In 1704, her works were published in the Netherlands,The Low Countries As a Crossroads of Religious Beliefs, Arie-Jan Gelderblom, Jan L. de Jong and Marc Van Vaeck, editors, Brill, 2004 becoming very popular. Many English and Germans visited her at Blois, among them Johann Wettstein and Lord Forbes. She spent the remainder of her life in retirement with her daughter, the Marquise de Bois, at Blois, where she died at the age of 69, believing that she had died submissive to the Catholic Church, from which she had never had any intention of separating herself. Her published works, the Moyen Court and the R√®gles des associ√©es √† l'Enfance de J√©sus, were both placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1688. F√©nelon's Maximes des saints was also condemned by both the Pope and the bishops of France. An anonymous 18th-century manuscript, hand-written in French, entitled \\"Supplement to the life of Madame Guyon\\" exists in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University,https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Auteur:Jeanne-Marie_Guyon which sets forth many fresh details about the Great Conflict which surrounded Madame Guyon. Date of birth There is some controversy surrounding the date of birth of Madame Guyon, but the date of 18 April 1648 given in the (highly condensed) English translation of Madame Guyon's autobiography, published by Moody Press, appears to be a typographical error‚Äîall French editions of the autobiography from the earliest one on, published in 1720,Jeanne-Marie Guyon. La vie de Madame J.-M. B. de la Mothe-Guion √©crite par elle-m√™me, J. De la Pierre, 1720 state 13 April 1648 as her birthday. Her date of birth, however, nonetheless remains unclear since Madame Guyon writes \\"Je naquis, √† ce que disent quelques uns, la veille de P√¢ques, le 13. d'Avril ... de l'ann√©e 1648\\" (\\"I was born, as some say, on the eve of Easter ..., the 13th of April of the year 1648\\"). The 13th of April 1648 was, however, Easter Monday of that year.

Headquartered in Ivrea, in the Metropolitan City of Turin, the company has been part of the Telecom Italia Group since 2003. One of the first commercial programmable desktop calculators, the Programma 101, was produced by Olivetti in 1964 and was a commercial success.  History  = Founding = Olivetti M40 typewriter (1930), designed by Camillo Olivetti with Gino Levi Martinoli (Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan). The company was founded as a typewriter manufacturer by Camillo Olivetti in 1908 in Ivrea, Italy. The firm was mainly developed by his son Adriano Olivetti. Olivetti opened its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1930, and its Divisumma electric calculator was launched in 1948. Olivetti produced Italy's first electronic computer, the transistorised Elea 9003, in 1959, and purchased the Underwood Typewriter Company that year. In 1964 the company sold its electronics division to the American company General Electric. It continued to develop new computing products on its own; one of these was Programma 101, one of the first commercially produced programmable calculators. In the 1970s and 1980s they were the biggest manufacturer for office machines in Europe and 2nd biggest PC vendor behind IBM in Europe. In 1980, Olivetti began distributing in Indonesia through Dragon Computer & Communication. In 1981, Olivetti installed the electronic voting systems for the European Parliament in Strasburg and Luxembourg. In September 1994, the company launched Olivetti Telemedia chaired by Elserino Piol. Since 2003, Olivetti has been part of the TIM Group. = Design = The Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, designed by Marcello Nizzoli in 1950 An Olivetti single-brand store, 1966. Olivetti was famous for the attention it gave to design: In 1952, the Museum of Modern Art held an exhibit titled \\"Olivetti: Design in Industry\\"; today, many Olivetti products are still part of the museum's permanent collection. Another major show, mounted by the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris in 1969, toured five other cities. Olivetti was also renowned for the caliber of the architects it engaged to design its factories and offices, including Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Gae Aulenti, Egon Eiermann, Figini-Pollini, Ignazio Gardella, Carlo Scarpa, BBPR, and many others.Nathan H. Shapira, Renzo Zorzi, Design Process: Olivetti 1908‚Äì1978, catalogue of a show at the Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery of UCLA, 1979. From the 1940s to the 1960s, Olivetti industrial design was led by Marcello Nizzoli, responsible for the Lexicon 80 (1948) and the portable Lettera 22 (1950). Later, Mario Bellini and Ettore Sottsass directed design.Walker, John. (1992) \\"Olivetti\\". Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945, 3rd. ed. Bellini designed the Programma 101 (1965), Divisumma 18 (1973) and Logos 68 (1973) calculators and the TCV-250 video display terminal (1966), among others. Sottsass designed the Tekne 3 typewriter (1958), Elea 9003 computer (1959), the Praxis 48 typewriter (1964), the Valentine portable typewriter (1969), and others. Michele De Lucchi designed the Art Jet 10 inkjet printer (1999) (winner of the Compasso d'Oro) and the Gioconda calculator (2001). During the 1970s Olivetti manufactured and sold two ranges of minicomputers. The 'A' series started with the typewriter-sized A4 through to the large A8, and the desk-sized DE500 and DE700 series. George Sowden worked for Olivetti from 1970 until 1990, and designed their first desktop computer, Olivetti L1, in 1978 (following ergonomic research lasting two years). In 1991, Sowden won the prestigious ADI Compasso d'Oro Award for the design of the Olivetti fax OFX420. Olivetti paid attention to more than product design; graphic and architectural design was also considered pivotal to the company. Giovanni Pintori was hired by Adriano Olivetti in 1936 to work in the publicity department. Pintori was the creator of the Olivetti logo and many promotional posters used to advertise the company and its products. During his activity as Art Director from 1950, Olivetti's graphic design obtained several international awards, and he designed works that created the Olivetti image and became emblematic Italian reference in the history of 20th-century design.Musina, Massimiliano. (2014) Giovanni Pintori. The Stark Tension Between Flair and Discretion. Bologna: Fausto Lupetti Editore. Those designers also created the Olivetti Synthesis office furniture series which mainly were used to be installed in the firm's own headquarters, worldwide branch offices and showrooms. Olivetti also produced some industrial production machinery, including metalworking machines of the Horizon series. = Typewriters = Olivetti began with mechanical typewriters when the company was founded in 1909, and produced them until the mid-1990s. Until the mid-1960s, they were fully mechanical, and models such as the portable Olivetti Valentine were designed by Ettore Sottsass. With the Tekne/Editor series and Praxis 48, some of the first electromechanical typewriters were introduced. The Editor series was used for speed typing championship competition. The Editor 5 from 1969 was the top model of that series, with proportional spacing and the ability to support justified text borders. In 1972 the electromechanical typeball machines of the Lexicon 90 to 94C series were introduced, as competitors to the IBM Selectric typewriters, the top model 94c supported proportional spacing and justified text borders like the Editor 5, as well as lift-off correction. In 1978 Olivetti was one of the first manufacturers to introduce electronic daisywheel printer-based word processing machines, called TES 401 and TES 501. Later the ET series typewriters without (or with) LCD and different levels of text editing capabilities were popular in offices. Models in that line were ET 121, ET 201, ET 221, ET 225, ET 231, ET 351, ET 109, ET 110, ET 111, ET 112, ET 115, ET 116, ET 2000, ET 2100, ET 2200, ET 2250, ET 2300, Et 2400 and ET 2500. For home users in 1982 the Praxis 35, Praxis 40 and 45D were some of the first portable electronic typewriters. Later, Olivetti added the Praxis 20, ET Compact 50, ET Compact 60, ET Compact 70, ET Compact 65/66, the ET Personal series and Linea 101. The top models were 8 lines LCD based portables like Top 100 and Studio 801, with the possibility to save the text to a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The professional line was upgraded with the ETV series video typewriters based on CP/M operating system, ETV 240, ETV 250, ETV 300, ETV 350 and later MS-DOS operating system based ETV 260, ETV 500, ETV 2700, ETV 2900, ETV 4000s word processing systems having floppy drives or hard disks. Some of them (ETV 300, 350, 500, 2900) were external boxes that could be connected through an optional serial interface to many of the ET series office typewriters, the others were fully integrated with an external monitor which could be installed on a holder over the desk. Most of the ET/ETV/Praxis series electronic typewriters were designed by Marion Bellini. By 1994, Olivetti stopped production of typewriters, as most users had transitioned to Personal Computers. = Computers = Olivetti's Programma 101 is considered one of the first commercial desktop programmable calculators. Exhibition at Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. Olivetti P6066 Olivetti L1 M40 ST Olivetti L1 M20 Between 1955 and 1964 Olivetti developed some of the first transistorized mainframe computer systems, such as the Elea 9003. Although 40 large commercial 9003 and over 100 smaller 6001 scientific machines were completed and leased to customers to 1964, low sales, loss of two key managers and financial instability caused Olivetti to withdraw from the field in 1964. In 1965 Olivetti released the Programma 101, considered one of the first commercial desktop programmable calculators. It was saved from the sale of the computer division to GE thanks to an employee, Gastone Garziera, who spent successive nights changing the internal categorization of the product from \\"computer\\" to \\"calculator\\", so leaving the small team in Olivetti and creating some awkward situations in the office, since that space was now owned by GE. In 1974 the firm released the TC800, an intelligent terminal designed to be attached to a mainframe and used in the finance sector. It was followed in 1977 by the TC1800. Olivetti's first modern personal computer, the M20, featuring a Zilog Z8000 CPU, was released in 1982. In 1983 the firm introduced the M24, a clone of the IBM PC using DOS and the Intel 8086 processor (at 8 MHz) instead of the Intel 8088 used by IBM (at 4.77 MHz). The M24 was sold in North America as the AT&T; 6300\\\\. Olivetti also manufactured the AT&T; 6300 Plus, which could run both DOS and Unix. The M24 in the US also was sold as Xerox 6060. The M28 was the firm's first PC to have the Intel 80286 processor. In 1983 Olivetti produced its M10 laptop computer, a 8085-based workalike of the successful Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100, which it marketed in Europe. These were the first laptops to sell in million-unit quantities, though the itself only attained sales figures in the tens of thousands and went out of production within two years. In 1985 the company acquired a controlling share in the British computer manufacturer Acorn Computers Ltd; a third partner was Thomson SA. Olivetti sold the Thomson MO6 and Acorn BBC Master Compact with brand names Olivetti Prodest PC128 and PC128s respectively. At the same time, Olivetti also tried to compete with :de: Schneider Euro PC with the MS-DOS-based Prodest PC1, but without success. In 1987 Olivetti introduced the LSX line of computers which was based on the Motorola 68k processor. They could run either MOS or Olivetti's Unix, X/OS. In 1989 Olivetti introduced the 80486 based next generation of LSX workstations with the LSX 5020 with EISA-Bus, it was shown in CeBit 1989 as \\"Computing Platform CP486\\". In 1990, Olivetti had its own distribution network in New Zealand through Essentially Software Ltd.. (owned by Gary McNabb) located at Mt. Eden in Auckland and Wellington, where an Olivetti M300-100 16 MHz PCs with 80386SX CPU were sold for NZ$7395 and used as graphical work station for design houses using Corel Draw as graphical program. The New Zealand distribution stopped in 1991 when Olivetti could not supply their PCs. Olivetti also sold quasi-portable 8086/8088-based PCs with an integrated keyboard and one or two integrated 3.5\\" floppy disk drives, running DOS 3.27, an Olivetti OEM version of PC DOS 3.20 with minor improvements like the M21 portable (based on M24) and the M15. Also later Olivetti produced interesting laptops like M111, M211, S20, D33, Philos and Echos series. A very interesting subnotebook was the Olivetti Quaderno, about the same size as an A5 paper ‚Äì it was the grandfather of the netbooks introduced 20 years later. = End of computer production = Olivetti did attempt to recover its position by introducing the Envision in 1995, a full multimedia PC, to be used in the living room; this project was a failure. Packard Bell managed to successfully introduce a similar product in the U.S. but only some years later. The main problem of the company was its inability to conjugate innovation with the quality standards it had committed itself to, at a time when the margins on the PC market were diminishing as not only the market but also the number of PC clone producers grew. The company continued to develop personal computers until it sold its PC business in 1997.

It was on the brink of collapse and had needed government support to stay afloat. A company in transition, it had moved out of the typewriter business into personal computers before embracing telecoms between 1997 and 1999. In the process it had lost around three-quarters of its staff. In 1999, The Luxembourg-based company Bell S.A. acquired a controlling stake in Olivetti, but sold it to a consortium including the Pirelli and Benetton groups two years later. Olivetti then launched a hostile bid for Telecom Italia in February 1999, despite being less than a seventh of the size of its target. In a take-over battle against Deutsche Telekom, and other potential bidders, Olivetti won out and controlled 52.12% of former monopoly Telecom Italia, Italy's #1 fixed-line and mobile phone operator. However, the ownership structure of the merged Olivetti / Telecom Italia was complex and multi-layered with Olivetti took on around $16 billion of extra debt. It was then referred to as the \\"Olivetti/Telecom Italia affair\\" because of the unpleasant secret affairs behind. After a 2003 reorganization, Olivetti became the office equipment and systems services subsidiary of Telecom Italia. In 2003 Olivetti was absorbed into the Telecom Italia group, maintaining a separate identity as Olivetti Tecnost. Rebirth and resumption of computer production In 2005, Telecom Italia relaunched the company in the information technology sector, investing ‚Ç¨200 million; at first, restoring the original Olivetti brand, then replacing it with Olivetti Tecnost in 2003. In 2007, Olivetti launched the \\"LINEA_OFFICE\\", designed by Jasper Morrison for Olivetti; a new line of PCs, notebooks, printers, fax machines and calculators. Olivetti today operates in Italy and Switzerland, and has sales associates in 83 countries. Research and development are located in Agli√®, Carsoli and Scarmagno in Italy, and Yverdon, Switzerland. In March 2011 Olivetti began producing the OliPad, its first tablet computer, featuring a ten-inch screen, 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity, Nvidia Tegra 2, Android 2.2.2 and a 1024 x 600 display. It also features an application store, with apps specifically designed by Olivetti for 'business & government'. In 2014 the R&D; department in Arnad was sold to SICPA.

In recognition of his bravery, he was presented a sword for his part in attempting to restore Prince Hamet Karamanli to his throne as the Bey of Tripoli. This sword became the model for the Mameluke Sword, adopted in 1825 for Marine Corps officers, which is part of the formal uniform today. Biography Presley Neville O'Bannon was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, to William O'Bannon, a captain of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), and Anne Neville, a sister of General John Neville, commander of Fort Pitt (formerly French Fort Dusquene, later Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania) during the Revolution. O'Bannon was probably named after Neville's son Presley, who was aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayette.Union County, Past and Present, Writers' Program (U.S.). Kentucky. Schuhmann Printing, 1941 - Union County (Ky.) O'Bannon entered the Marine Corps on January 18, 1801. As a first lieutenant assigned to , he commanded a detachment of seven Marines and two Navy midshipmen in diplomatic Consul General William Eaton's (1764‚Äì1811) small army during the Tripoli campaign of the First Barbary War (1801‚Äì1805). In the combined operations with the U.S. Navy, he led the successful attack at the Battle of Derna, a coastal town in eastern modern Libya on April 27, 1805, giving the Marines' Hymn its line \\"to the shores of Tripoli.\\" Lieutenant O'Bannon became the first man to raise a United States flag over foreign soil in time of war; O'Bannon's superior, William Eaton (1764‚Äì1811), a former Army officer, had raised the American flag several months earlier while traveling on the Nile River from Alexandria to Cairo, but it had not been in a time of war. According to Marine Corps legend, Hamet Karamanli was so impressed with O'Bannon's bravery that he gave him a Mameluke sword as a gesture of respect. O'Bannon resigned from the Marine Corps on March 6, 1807. He moved to Logan County, Kentucky, making his home in Russellville. He served in the Kentucky State Legislature in 1812, 1817, and 1820‚Äì21, and in the Kentucky State Senate from 1824 to 1826. Some time before 1826, he married Matilda Heard, daughter of Major James Heard and Nancy Morgan, a daughter of American Revolutionary War general Daniel Morgan, commander at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in 1781). O'Bannon died in 1850 at age 74 in Pleasureville, Kentucky, where his daughter and nephew lived. In 1919, his remains were moved to the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky's state capital. Mameluke sword Because of O'Bannon's distinguished record during the Derna campaign, Marine Corps Commandant Archibald Henderson in 1825 adopted the Mameluke sword for wear by all Marine Corps commissioned officers. Since the initial distribution in 1826, the Mameluke sword has been worn except for the years 1859‚Äì1875, when regulations temporarily required Marine officers to wear the model U.S. Army M1850 foot officers' sword. Mameluke swords are worn by Marine Corps officers as prescribed with all uniforms except the evening dress and utility uniform.

Anzani was an engine manufacturer founded by the Italian Alessandro Anzani (1877‚Äì1956), which produced proprietary engines for aircraft, cars, boats, and motorcycles in factories in Britain, France and Italy. Overview From his native Italy, Anzani moved to France where he became involved in cycle racing. He moved on to motorcycles and designed and built a record breaking lightweight engine. In 1907, he set up a small workshop in Paris with three staff and while they were building his engines, he designed a hydrofoil powered by one of his engines and propellers. Aircraft engines He supplied one of his engines to Enrico Forlanini and developed it further into a three-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engine ideal for the new aeroplanes. One of the early engines, the 25 hp Anzani W-3 or Fan type, was supplied to Louis Bl√©riot who used it on his successful first aircraft crossing of the English Channel in 1909. =Types= * Anzani 3-cyl.

Another factory at Monza, Italy was added in 1914. Motor racing In 1920, Anzani turned to motor racing and built a small car with one of his 750 cc two-cylinder engines, air-cooled of course, which won several competitions. They also made a 1098 cc cyclecar between 1923 and 1924, as used in the T.B. Sports cyclecar. Sale of factories On his 50th birthday in 1927, Anzani decided to sell his factories in Paris and London, keeping only the Monza works for sentimental reasons, and managed by Natale Baccanti. British Anzani In the UK, British Anzani outsourced the manufacture of their engines to Coventry Ordnance Works Ltd. In the 1920s, it was refinanced as British Vulpine Engine Company, and then again as British Anzani Engineering Company, concentrating on small engines and car and motorcycle powerplants. They supplied AC Cars with the 1496cc side-valve four-cylinder (that would become AC's famous 2-litre motor), Frazer-Nash with a 1496cc side valve engine, (latterly supercharged) Morgan Motor Company with a V-twin, and Squire with the R1 twin cam engine. Berkeley Cars used small Anzani motorcycle engines in some models. British Anzani's best known products were motorcycle, lawnmower and outboard engines. Cotton, Tandon and Greeves motorcycles used Anzani motors. In later years, the company diversified. In the years after World War II, the company's main product was the 'Iron Horse' - a two-wheeled pedestrian-controlled ploughing engine and light tractor. In time, four-wheeled versions with the driver sitting on the front of the vehicle were produced. The company became the British Anzani Group, and was trading under that name when it went into liquidation in 1980. The trademark 'British Anzani' was re-registered in 2003 and the company, Anzani Ltd, in 2006. The company is supplying classic spares through Dolphin Engines of Launceston (Cornwall, UK) and is planning a return to the automotive, marine and transport industries, with products designed by Bo Zolland.

Upon William's accession, W√ºrttemberg was suffering crop failures and famine in the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", in 1816. After taking office, he initiated sweeping reforms, resulting in the approval of the Estates of W√ºrttemberg to a constitution on September 25, 1819. In his 48-year reign, the kingdom moved from one that was created from different denominational principalities and a heterogeneous agricultural country, into a constitutional state with a common identity and a well-organised management. In addition to his successful domestic policy, he pursued throughout his reign an ambition focused on German and European foreign policy. Alongside the great powers of Prussia and Austria, he imagined a third major German power in the form of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and W√ºrttemberg. Although this plan never succeeded, it ensured a consistent, coherent and targeted policy during his reign. William was the only German monarch who was forced to recognise the Frankfurt Constitution of 1848. After the failure of the March Revolution of 1848, he pursued restorative policies that counteracted his liberal image from before the revolution. He died in 1864 at Rosenstein Castle in Bad Cannstatt and is buried in the W√ºrttemberg Mausoleum. Life =Youth= Portrait of a young Frederick William Born at L√ºben (after 1945 Lubin, Poland) cites . on 27 September 1781, Frederick William (known as \\"Fritz\\" until the beginning of his reign) was the son of Duke Frederick William Charles of W√ºrttemberg (1754‚Äì1816) and his wife, Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1764‚Äì1788). The relationship between his mother and father was one of strife and discord. His father had entered the Prussian military in 1774, then moved shortly after William's birth to the service of the Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, who appointed him Governor-General of Eastern Finland. Although William's mother gave birth in 1783 to his sister Catharina Frederica, then later that year to Sophia Dorothea, and Paul in 1785, the relationship between the parents continued to deteriorate. Augusta sought sanctuary from her abusive marriage and asked the Empress for protection in 1786. Catherine forced Friedrich and his children to leave Russia and placed Augusta in the custody of a former royal huntsman, Reinhold Wilhelm von Pohlmann, by whom she later became pregnant. She died in 1788 in agony from a miscarriage, due to Pohlmann refusing to seek medical attention in order to conceal the illegitimate pregnancy. In 1790, Friedrich and his two sons moved to Ludwigsburg Palace. He made sure that his sons' educators were from W√ºrttemberg and their education, at the behest of their father, was regulated and very strict. Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg died on 24 October 1793. He had ruled for 56 years and as he had no legitimate offspring, the duchy passed to his brothers, Louis Eugene in 1793, then two years later to Frederick II Eugene, who was Frederick William's grandfather. Frederick William's father thus became Hereditary Prince (Erbprinz) in 1795, then Duke on 23 December 1797. In 1797, Duke Frederick's father married Charlotte, Princess Royal, the daughter of King George III of Great Britain. They then began to look for a wife for Frederick William and potential brides included the Holy Roman Emperor's sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia, and the Grand Duchesses Alexandra Pavlovna and Maria Pavlovna. Duke Frederick's relationship with his son also deteriorated. Frederick William often rebelled against his upbringing and his father. In 1799, Frederick William's escape plans were discovered and his father had him temporarily arrested. After his release, Frederick William began studying at the University of T√ºbingen. After the War of the Second Coalition erupted and France marched under Napoleon in the spring of 1800, Frederick William, who had joined as a volunteer in the Austrian army, participated in the Battle of Hohenlinden in December 1800. In 1803 he attained the rank of Imperial Major General. Contemporaries have credited him with profound military knowledge, courage and bravery. After returning to W√ºrttemberg in 1801, Frederick William and his brother Paul began liaisons with the daughters of the landscape architect, Konradin von Abel. Frederick William fell in love with Therese von Abel, four years his senior. At that time there were clashes between Duke Frederick and the Estates of W√ºrttemberg (the Landst√§nde) on domestic and foreign policy issues. Konradin von Abel represented the foreign policy interests of the estates and was supported by Frederick William, who moved against the interests of his father's policies. In 1803 Frederick William fled W√ºrttemberg to Paris, Vienna, Schaffhausen and Saarburg. In Saarburg, Therese gave birth to twins, who died shortly after birth. Now Elector of W√ºrttemberg, Frederick wanted to bring his son back to W√ºrttemberg. Frederick William went in October to Paris, where he was received on 14 October by Napoleon. Elector Frederick prevented the planned marriage of his son with Therese von Abel through diplomatic interventions, though separating the two did not happen until the autumn of 1804. During his time in Paris, Frederick William received financial support from the Landst√§nde and later from Napoleon. =Heir to the throne= On September 11, 1805, Frederick William left Paris and returned (after a visit to his grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in Brunswick) to Stuttgart, where in November he met his father for the first time in a few years. His return was mainly due to the change in the political climate. The United Kingdom, which had been at war with Napoleon since 1803, formed an alliance with Russia and Austria. Napoleon had W√ºrttemberg's neighbours of Baden and Bavaria on his side, so W√ºrttemberg was forced, after some hesitation, to yield to French pressure and also enter into an alliance with Napoleon. The French Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggested a coup against Elector Frederick, in which his son was to replace him, but Frederick William opposed the suggestion. This act is regarded as the main reason for William's subsequent aversion to Napoleon. Friedrich refused to involve his son in the affairs of state, but gave him his own court headed by his friend, Ernst von Pfuel-Riepurr, who had accompanied him in his time out of the country. Frederick William took the time to further his education, including acquiring a knowledge of agriculture. From January 1, 1806, the territorial gains as a result of the German mediatization enlarged the electorate of W√ºrttemberg and it became a kingdom. In 1806, Prussia joined the coalition against Napoleon and was defeated and occupied within a few weeks. Napoleon wanted W√ºrttemberg to be bound to him closer by marriage. On August 13, 1807, Frederick William's sister, Catherine, married Napoleon's brother J√©r√¥me, the king of the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia. In order to prevent Napoleon arranging a marriage for him, Frederick William sought permission from his father to marry Charlotte (later Caroline) Augusta, the daughter of the Bavarian king Maximilian I Joseph. After lengthy negotiations took place, the pair were married on June 8, 1808, in Munich. Since it was purely a marriage of convenience and Frederick William had no interest in a deeper relationship with his wife, Charlotte became increasingly lonely in Stuttgart. Frederick often stayed in Kassel at the court of his brother-in-law, J√©r√¥me. Here he met J√©r√¥me's former lover, Blanche La Fl√®che, Baroness of Keudelstein. He began an affair with her, which he later continued as king. In 1809, Napol√©on had W√ºrttemberg commit troops for his war against Austria, while safeguarding its own eastern borders. Frederick William received the command of the troops deployed for border defence. At Napoleon's Russian campaign, Frederick William was again in command of troops. The campaign was devastating for the W√ºrttemberg army. Of the 15,800 soldiers, only a few hundred returned to W√ºrttemberg. After the Battle of Leipzig from 16 to 19 October 1813, W√ºrttemberg moved to the side of the alliance against Napoleon. Frederick William then took over the command of the Army of W√ºrttemberg, which was reinforced by Austrian troops in November. On December 30, the army crossed the Rhine at H√ºningen. Despite having suffered heavy losses in 1812 and 1813 fighting as an ally of France, W√ºrttemberg agreed to raise an army for the Allies of 12,250 regular infantry, 2,900 cavalry and 12,250 militia. By strenuous efforts this quota was filled. At first, the W√ºrttemberger contingent was designated the German VI Corps, but in a subsequent reorganization it became the IV Corps in the main Allied army of Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. It marched to war with 14,000 men and 24 artillery pieces. Frederick William directed his corps in the First Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 24 January 1814. One source asserted that IV Corps suffered 900 casualties in this combat while their Austrian allies lost 837. French losses were about 1,200. The IV Corps participated in the Allied victory over Napoleon at the Battle of La Rothi√®re on 1 February. On 18 February 1814, Schwarzenberg ordered Frederick William to hold Montereau until evening. Accordingly, the Crown Prince placed 8,500 foot soldiers, 1,000 horsemen and 26 artillery pieces on the north bank of the Seine River. The defending force included an Austrian brigade. The first French attacks in the morning were driven off, but by the mid-afternoon Napoleon was on the scene with 30,000 troops and 70 cannons. Frederick William ordered a retreat, but the movement quickly degenerated into a mad dash for safety across the single bridge with French cavalry in hot pursuit. The Allies lost 2,600 killed and wounded, plus 3,400 soldiers and 15 field pieces captured. The French lost 2,000 but captured the vital bridge intact. The W√ºrttembergers reported 806 killed and wounded, not counting prisoners. On 25 March, the main Allied army came upon a 19,000-man French corps by surprise in the Battle of F√®re- Champenoise. Leading the advance, Frederick William decided not to wait for his infantry to catch up but to attack with his cavalry alone. The result was a crushing Allied victory as the French corps suffered losses of 2,000 killed and wounded while losing 4,000 prisoners, 45 cannons and 100 ammunition wagons. A nearby 4,300-strong French division with 16 cannons was also caught and completely wiped out. The Allies sustained 2,000 casualties out of 28,000 men and 80 guns engaged. At the Battle of Paris on 30 March, 6,500 W√ºrttembergers fought, losing 160 killed, wounded and captured. With the fall of Napoleon, Frederick William took the opportunity to begin divorce proceedings from his wife. He had been in the United Kingdom in June 1814 with his cousin Grand Duchess Catherine of Russia, the widow of Duke George of Oldenburg, and the two were in love. After Charlotte, King Frederick and King Maximilian Joseph had agreed to the divorce, a divorce court was convened by King Frederick on 31 August 1814. Both parties had indicated that the marriage was not consummated because of animosity. Annulment by Pope Pius VII, which was necessary because Charlotte was Catholic, did not take place until over a year later on 12 January 1816, shortly before the wedding of Frederick William and Catherine. Charlotte then married on 10 November 1816, the Austrian Emperor Franz I. Frederick William and Catherine also attended the Congress of Vienna from September 1814, where diplomats drew up a new Europe following Napoleon's downfall. After the return of Napoleon and the subsequent war in 1815, Frederick William commanded the Austrian III Corps which in one of the minor campaigns invaded France and besieged General Jean Rapp in Strasbourg. He was the only member of the ruling German royal families who participated actively as a military commander in the wars of 1814 and 1815. Wilhelm Hauff celebrated this in his poem Prinz Wilhelm. On 24 January 1816, Frederick William married Catherine in St. Petersburg. The newly-weds stayed in Russia for a few months and arrived in Stuttgart on 13 April 1816. =Early reign= Accession King William in 1822 King Frederick died on October 30, 1816, at 1:30 am. On the same day, Catherine, who already had two sons from her first marriage, gave birth to their daughter Marie Friederike Charlotte. Although in King Frederick's declining years, he and his son no longer had any political and personal conflicts, Frederick William was eager to display a new era of political change and power. As such, he did away with his first name of Frederick and chose his second name of Wilhelm (William) as his regnal name. He reduced the monarchical titles to simply Wilhelm, by the Grace of God, King of W√ºrttemberg. The national coat of arms was also simplified and he reduced the colours of the state flag of black, red and gold, to simply black and red. He also announced an amnesty for civil and military prisoners. William dismissed most of the ministers of state, made the Privy Council his government and gave new senior positions at court and in the civil service. Measures against economic hardship William's accession to the throne fell into a time of great economic hardship. In April 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia, which led to a long-term deterioration of global weather conditions. In the spring and summer of 1816 there was nowhere in Europe without a storm, rain or hail. In October the first snow fell in W√ºrttemberg. The year 1816 became known as the Year Without A Summer. In W√ºrttemberg, there were crop failures which gave rise to food prices. In the winter of 1816/1817, famine broke out. To alleviate the plight, the government fixed maximum prices for food, made exporting difficult and later banned it. Large amounts of grain were brought from outside the country. The famine was alleviated by the King and Queen, whose policies were aimed at long-term improvement in the economic situation of all social classes. William implemented agricultural reforms, while Catherine devoted her care to the poor. On November 20, 1818, William set up an Agricultural Academy in Hohenheim to radically improve general nutrition in the kingdom through teaching, experimentation and demonstration and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the University of Hohenheim. To help people to help themselves W√ºrttemberg plant alley of fruit- trees.(Dienstbarkeit on private ground near streets). The tree farms from William, also the Br√ºdergemeinde delivered for free.Apfelgeschichte auf Apfelgut Sulz In the same year he set up the Cannstatter Volksfest, which was to take place annually on 28 September, a day after the king's birthday. William bought cattle and sheep from abroad for farmers to raise them in W√ºrttemberg and he was known for his Arabian stallions that formed part of the Marbach stud. Around the country, Catherine set up charities, which were controlled by a national charity in Stuttgart. Donations were received from the private property of the royal couple, by Catherine's mother the Tsarina, and by other members of the royal family. The W√ºrttembergische Landessparkasse (Wurttemberg State Savings Bank) was established on May 12, 1818, on Catherine's initiative. At the same time, a poor relief authority was set up in the Ministry of Interior. The completion of the Katharinenhospital in 1828 was initiated via a donation by Catherine in 1817. The Mohrenk√∂pfle is a breed of pig. On the orders of King Wilhelm I, these \\"masked\\" pigs were imported from Central China in 1820/21, in order to improve pig breeding in the kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Cross-breeding local breeds with these \\"Chinese pigs\\" was particularly successful within stocks of domestic pigs in the Hohenlohe region and the area around the town of Schw√§bisch Hall. Mohrenk√∂pfle Death of Queen Catherine Queen Catherine in 1817 Catherine and William's second daughter Sophie, who later became Queen of the Netherlands, was born on June 17, 1818. Despite the outwardly harmonious marriage of William and Catherine, William had extramarital affairs. He took to his former lover Blanche La Fl√®che again. Eduard von Kallee, born on 26 February 1818 is thought to be his illegitimate son. When Catherine found her husband in Scharnhausen on January 3, 1819, with a lover (presumably Blanche La Fleche), she travelled back to Stuttgart. She died of complications from pneumonia on January 9. William had the W√ºrttemberg Mausoleum constructed for her on W√ºrttemberg Hill and she was buried in 1824. To cover up the circumstances of her death he tried to obtain her letters, which he suspected contained information about his love affairs. The main political reason for this was so W√ºrttemberg's relationship with Russia would not be strained. William wrote in a letter that he was considering abdication. He wanted his brother Paul to renounce his claim to the throne, in favour of Paul's son, Frederick. After their mother's death, Catherine's sons by her first marriage went to live with their grandfather, Peter, the-then regent and later Grand Duke of Oldenburg. =Period of consolidation= Family and private life Queen Pauline and her son Charles in 1825. Soon after the death of Queen Catherine, William sought a new marriage. He looked again to a cousin, Pauline (1800‚Äì1873) who was the daughter of his uncle Louis and 19 years his junior. The wedding took place on 19 April 1820 at Stuttgart. Pauline tended to be rather pious and was a prude. For example, when her daughter was to be painted naked as a baby, Pauline refused it. The beginning of the marriage was outwardly harmonious and the royal couple undertook official duties and many activities together. On August 24, 1821, their first daughter Catherine was born. The birth of the heir Charles on March 6, 1823, was received by the people and the royal family with great joy. Their third child Augusta was born on October 4, 1826. William continued to maintain extramarital relationships with other women. When travelling to Italy, he continued to meet with Blanche La Fl√®che. In the late 1820s, the royal couple became increasingly alienated. William began a relationship with the actress Amalie of Stubenrauchstra√üe. Born in 1803, she started her acting career in 1823 at the Munich Court Theatre. After a stint in March 1827, in the autumn of 1828 she became permanent at the Stuttgart Court Theatre, where William soon became aware of her. William and Amelia would keep up their relationship until William's death in 1864. Politics In October 1820 a manuscript entitled Manuskript aus S√ºddeutschland (Manuscript from Southern Germany) was published in London. The book contained a review of the historical development and the political situation in Germany. It called for a further mediatisation of small countries in Germany to the four central states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and W√ºrttemberg, which together should form a counterweight to the great powers of Prussia and Austria. It was suggested W√ºrttemberg should gain Baden, the principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, as well as Alsace. Soon it became known that the published name of the author and editor of the book were fake. The real author was Friedrich Ludwig Lindner (1772‚Äì1845), who was somewhat of a personal assistant to William. It was assumed that William was behind this idea and that Lindner acted as his ghostwriter. The manuscript caused diplomatic tensions between Prussia and Austria on one side and W√ºrttemberg on the other. At the Congress of Verona in 1822, the great powers of Austria, Prussia and Russia launched an isolation on W√ºrttemberg. In the spring of 1823, diplomatic relations were broken off, the foreign minister, Count Wintzingerode, and the Bundestag envoy, Freiherr von Wangenheim, resigned. The popularity of William rose in liberal circles. Reprisals, however, meant that William had to give in. In November 1824 W√ºrttemberg agreed to an extension of the anti-liberal Carlsbad Decrees. After the successful French July Revolution of 1830, the Liberals were buoyant in most of Europe, as well as in W√ºrttemberg. The struggle for freedom in Poland against Russia in 1830/1831 reinforced this trend. In December 1831, the Liberals won the elections to the second chamber of the W√ºrttemberg Landtag. At the Hambach Festival on May 27, 1832, in which Hambach Castle in the Rhineland-Palatinate was a backdrop for liberal and democratic rallies, the call for banned political gatherings was answered. William moved to convene the parliament elected in 1831 for over a year until 15 January 1833. After the dissolution of parliament on 22 March, elections were held in April, and Friedrich R√∂mer's liberals again emerged victorious. Diplomatic relations between W√ºrttemberg and Prussia and Austria were also limited at this time. From 1836 William tried to better relations with Prussia. In September 1836 Prince William, later German Emperor, visited Stuttgart. 1838 saw a return visit by King William to Berlin, where he and cousin, the Tsar Nicholas I met. From this point, a Prussian envoy in W√ºrttemberg was established. At various times Wilhelm was interested in forming a \\"Third Germany\\" of smaller states outside the control of Vienna and Berlin, but this never took form. The Jubil√§umss√§ule on the Schlossplatz in Stuttgart One area of co-operation with Prussia was the Zollverein customs union. Wilhelm signed a Bavaria‚ÄìW√ºrttemberg Customs Union (BWCU) in 1828, with mixed results. In 1828-34 the BWCU signed commercial agreements and then became full members of the German Customs Union. Seen now as a precursor of German unity under Prussia in 1871, at the time it was hoped that stronger local economies would preserve the independence of the smaller states such as W√ºrttemberg. The 1830s were characterised by an economic boom in W√ºrttemberg. Agriculture, trade and crafts flourished and debt and taxes were down. Shipping on the Neckar via the Wilhelmskanal had become possible in 1821, and the road network was expanded. Plans were produced for the construction of the first railways. William was very interested in the emerging industrialisation and visited, in 1837, the United Kingdom, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. For his Silver Jubilee in 1841, the kingdom was in excellent financial shape. On September 27, 1841 William celebrated his 60th birthday. On 28 September, a procession took place in Stuttgart with 10,390 participants, including 640 riders and 23 horses and wagons with teams of oxen from the entire kingdom. 200,000 spectators had come to the capital, which had 40,000 inhabitants. On the Schlossplatz a solid wooden column was built, which was replaced two years later by the central stone \\"Jubil√§umss√§ule\\" (Jubilee Pillar). The whole town was decorated, fireworks were set off in the evening and bonfires were made all around the country. William was celebrated by patriotic poems and songs in the newspapers. The celebrations and participation around the country expressed how the country had become unified and connected under William's reign. =Revolution of 1848/1849= Stirnbrand. All the participants are identified on the painting's page at Wikimedia Commons. In 1846 and 1847, poor harvests in W√ºrttemberg gave rise to famine and increased emigration. The relatively satisfied mood of the population became sour. Liberal and democratic demands were expressed more forcefully. In January 1848 a protest in Stuttgart called for an all-German Federal Parliament, freedom of the press, freedom of association and assembly, introduction of jury trials and arming of the people. In February, a revolution broke out again in France. When Louis Philippe I abdicated and fled into exile to England, William recognised the urgency of the situation and tried the stop the revolution through concessions to the liberals and democrats. On March 1, he reinstated the liberal press law of 1817, which had been overturned previously by the Carlsbad Decrees in 1819. He tried to replace the Privy Council under the conservative Joseph von Linden, but this failed on March 6 as a result of further protests. William then agreed to forming a liberal government under Friedrich R√∂mer. On March 18, 1848, the W√ºrttemberg army was sworn not to the king but to the Constitution. Although R√∂mer never had the confidence of William, he made sure that during the revolution in W√ºrttemberg, a majority for the abolition of the monarchy was never formed. In April, the W√ºrttemberg army was involved in the crackdown on the uprising of Friedrich Hecker and Gustav von Struve in Baden. In June 1848, a new parliament was selected in which R√∂mer's liberals again received the majority in the upper chamber. William visited Frankfurt in July 1848, where since May 18 that year, the Frankfurt Parliament met and on 29 June 1848 and had chosen Archduke John of Austria to be regent. The parliament proposed, on March 8, 1849, that Frederick William of Prussia should be elected Emperor of Germany. R√∂mer advised William to accept this choice, but if Frederick William refused, R√∂mer advised William he had a good chance of being elected emperor himself. This flattery increased, however, only the mistrust of William against R√∂mer. On April 20, 1849, the Chamber of Deputies voted in the Landtag with only two dissenting votes in favour of recognising the constitution drafted by the Frankfurt Parliament on 28 March 1849. William refused to do so and justified his refusal in a supplement to the Schw√§bischer Merkur (Swabian Mercury) with a circulation of 12,000 copies. Given the tricky situation of Stuttgart, he moved his court to the garrison city of Ludwigsburg. On 25 April, William decided to accept the constitution. But he felt it was imposed humiliation, which was multiplied when he realized that he was the only ruler of a larger German state who had accepted the Constitution. After the Frankfurt Parliament had failed with the rejection of the German imperial crown by Frederick William of Prussia, on 30 May 1849 the remaining members decided to relocate the parliament to Stuttgart. Derisively known as the Rumpfparlament (\\"rump parliament\\"), on June 6, 1849, the remaining 154 deputies met initially under President Wilhelm Loewe in Stuttgart. Following its view of itself as the legitimate German parliament, the rump parliament called for tax resistance and military resistance against those states that did not accept the Paulskirche Constitution. Since this view also diminished the autonomy of W√ºrttemberg, and the Prussian army was successfully crushing the rebellions in the nearby Baden and the Palatinate, the W√ºrttemberg government rapidly distanced itself from the rump parliament. On June 17, the president of the parliament was informed that the W√ºrttemberg government was no longer in a position to tolerate the meetings that had moved to its territory, nor the activities of the regency elected on the 6th, anywhere in Stuttgart or W√ºrttemberg. At this point, the rump parliament had only 99 deputies and did not reach a quorum according to its own rules. On June 18, the W√ºrttemberg army occupied the parliamentary chamber before the session started. The deputies reacted by organising an impromptu protest march which was promptly squashed by the soldiers without bloodshed. Those deputies that were not from W√ºrttemberg were expelled. On July 2, William returned to Stuttgart. In August 1849 elections were held for a Constituent Assembly in which the democrats reached the majority against the moderate liberals. While the liberals called for the right to an income level and assets, the democrats demanded universal, equal and direct suffrage for all adult men. At the end of October 1849 the king dismissed the government under Friedrich R√∂mer. On December 7, 1849, the principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen were incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. William's objective of mediatising these states into W√ºrttemberg therefore failed. The-then shattered relationship with Prussia was not normalised until 1852 with the resumption of diplomatic relations. From 1850 Wilhelm led a reactionary policy. His experience in the revolution led him to reject generally representative governments.Hartwig Brandt: Parlamentarismus in W√ºrttemberg 1815‚Äì1870. Anatomie eines deutschen Landtags in Handbuch der Geschichte des deutschen Parlamentarismus. D√ºsseldorf 1987, , p. 625. He wanted the people to be \\"free from the periodic fever of elections\\".Bemerkungen √ºber die St√§ndeversammlung in Deutschland und Vorschl√§ge √ºber die Art ihrer Verbesserung. Stuttgart Archives G268 Tuft 24 On July 2, 1850, he set up a new government with the conservative Joseph von Linden as Minister of the Interior. He was a more compliant rubber stamp for William's restoration policy. The old constitution was re-enacted, the army was sworn in again on the king rather than the Constitution, corporal punishment was reintroduced in 1852 and the death penalty in 1853.Decree of October 5, 1851 (reprinted in the W√ºrttemberg Official Gazette No. 247) and Act of April 2, 1852 (reprinted in the W√ºrttemberg Official Gazette No. 81) Linden's conservative cabinet remained until shortly after William's death in office. =Later years and death= Napoleon III, William I and Alexander II at the Meeting of the Two Emperors at Stuttgart in 1857. In the 1850s, the polarity between Prussia and Austria came to a head in Germany. William pursued a foreign policy strategy shifting alliances and agreements with the major European powers. In the Crimean War between Russia on one hand and the Ottoman Empire, France and Great Britain on the other, he pushed for a neutrality of the German Confederation. This strengthened the position of the W√ºrttemberg ally of Russia. After the Crimean War, William tried to normalise his country's relations with France. The French emperor since 1852, Napol√©on III, was the nephew of his brother-in-law, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte. The Holy Alliance between Russia, Austria and Prussia had ended on the outbreak of the Crimean War. On September 27, 1857, a meeting organised by William was held in Stuttgart, between Napol√©on III and Tsar Alexander II. The emperors agreed that Russia would not intervene in any war that France would have in assisting Sardinia in a war against Austria (later to become the Second Italian War of Independence). Especially in his old age, European princes often sought his advice. His biographer Paul Sauer therefore referred to him as \\"Nestor among the princes of Europe\\".Paul Sauer: Reformer auf dem K√∂nigsthron. Wilhelm I. von W√ºrttemberg. Stuttgart 1997, , p. 513. King William in 1861. William's marriage looked happy to outsiders, but in actuality was completely shattered. He was constantly accompanied by his mistress, Amalie, on private visits. He did not trust his son, Prince Charles, to takeover governmental functions; Charles's homosexual inclinations troubled him. He was very fond of his daughter-in-law and niece, Crown Princess Olga. She often had to mediate between her husband and her father-in-law, which over long periods led to a tense relationship between her and William. His daughters from his marriage to Catherine both had marital disputes with their husbands, Alfred von Neipperg and William III of the Netherlands. King William became increasingly hard of hearing with age and underwent frequent treatment from the 1850s.Robert Uhland (ed.): Das Tagebuch der Eveline von Massenbach. Hofdame der K√∂nigin Olga von W√ºrttemberg. Stuttgart 1997, , p. 138. In the autumn of 1863, his condition deteriorated. He had little contact with his family, whereas his mistress Amalie was constantly with him. He was often visited by the writer Friedrich Wilhelm Hackl√§nder.Friedrich Wilhelm Hackl√§nder: Der Roman meines Lebens Band II. Stuttgart 1878, p. 340f. Before his death, he had his private letters and records destroyed.Karl Johannes Grauer: K√∂nig Wilhelm von W√ºrttemberg und die europ√§ischen Dynastien in Zeitschrift f√ºr W√ºrttembergische Landesgeschichte. 1956, p. 263. Transfer of the body of William I, in the early morning hours of 30 June 1864, to the W√ºrttemberg Mausoleum. William died on the morning of June 25, 1864, at 5:10, at Schloss Rosenstein in the presence of his personal physician, Dr. Karl Alsatian, and a valet. On the morning of 30 June, in the presence of his son and successor, King Charles and his stepson Peter of Oldenburg, he was buried alongside his second wife Catherine in the W√ºrttemberg Mausoleum. A few hours later, a memorial service was held there in which his widow Queen Pauline, his daughter-in-law Queen Olga, his daughters Queen Sophie of the Netherlands, Princess Catherine and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, his nephew Grand Duke Constantine of Russia and his stepson Peter of Oldenburg, were present.Official W√ºrttemberg Gazette, 2 July 1864 While William did not mention his wife Pauline in his will, he made sure that his former mistresses Therese of Abel and Blanche La Fl√®che received pensions. Queen Pauline and King Charles insisted Amalie of Stubenrauchstra√üe left court and she moved to an estate in Tegernsee, located next to the villa Arco, which they had acquired in 1862. She died there on 14 April 1876 and was buried in Tegernsee.  Memorials  =1st Cannstatter Volksfest 1818-2018= On 28 September 1818, one day after the king's 36th birthday, a big agricultural festival with horse races and prize-giving for outstanding cattle-breeding achievements is celebrated on the so-called Cannstatter Wasen site.

Apal is a small-scale automobile company originally from Belgium. It is now based in Germany. Phase 1 -APAL - s.√†.r.l. Application Polyester Arm√© de Li√®ge (1961‚Äì1998) Porsche-engined Apal Coup√© 1600 (1963) Glass-fibre specialist Edmond Pery founded this small automobile manufacturing company in Blegny-Trembleur (Li√®ge), Belgium in 1961. Pery presented his first model, a GT coup√© with gull-wing doors, propelled by Volkswagen or Porsche engines at the Brussels Autosalon (or Salon auto de Bruxelles) in 1962. In 1965, Apal started producing a Formule V single-seater. The Apal Horizon GT was a mid-engined sports car and was made in a limited number in 1968 and 1969. Between 1968 and 1981, about 5,000 glass-fibre bodies were produced for different buggy models such as Apal Buggy, Apal Rancho, Apal Jet, Apal Auki, and the Apal Corsa (a sporty version with gull-wing doors). The Jet was a copy of a buggy originally developed by Glassco Inc. of USA. This set of molds then made its way to England, where PABC/Eresbug built it in London, with the Four Seasons Buggy Company manufacturing it from 1971 on and finally GP Projects from 1975 until 1976. Apal traded the Auki buggy molds for the Jet molds and modified them, adding a T-bar and side skirts and replacing the curved Ford Anglia windshield (not as easy to acquire in continental Europe) with a flat unit. The Apal 1200 Saloon was an attractive car based on Volkswagen beetle floorplan. It had a thrust-forward nose with a divided front bumper and a well-sloped curved one-piece windshield. The rear-mounted engine was air- cooled, with cooling air exhausting through a grille in the rounded tail, which also sported a divided rear bumper. 1966 Apal Formula Vee single seater. Apal Horizon GT The company's most successful model was called the Apal Speedster and is a replica of the Porsche 356 Speedster, built on a VW Beetle floorplan. Altogether 700 were completed between 1981 and 1994. In 1984 Apal also developed a two-seater sports coup√© using Mercedes-Benz W201 underpinnings, called the Francorchamps after the Belgian racetrack. This was developed together with an American company with the aim of selling the car in the United States, but with the dollar rapidly losing value the project became untenable and only two copies were built. The company's last model, named the Apal Sport One, based on the Pontiac Fiero, appeared in 1992. Edmond Pery also designed an all-road prototype for DAF in 1974 and another prototype for Volkswagen in 1992. The small firm produced and sold all models in limited numbers. =Specifications of 1966 Model Apal 1200 Saloon= Engine: four- cylinder air-cooled VW, 1192 cc, 7.0 compression ratio, rated at 40 PS Maximum speed: 80 mph (129 km/h) Overall length: Overall width: Height: Turning circle: Wheelbase: Front track: Rear track: Fuel tank capacity: Empty weight: L.

Folklorists have documented folk versions with obscene lyrics from the 19th century. : Lyrics of The Wiggles and Sharon Lois and Bram Another version is called \\"Natchez Under the Hill\\". The lyrics are thought to have been added to an earlier tune by Bob Farrell who first performed them in a blackface act on August 11, 1834. : 1st verse of another version In 1942, a soundie titled, \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" was created by Freddie Fisher and The Schnickelfritz Band. (Directed by Sam Coslow and Produced by Josef Berne). There are two versions to the chorus that are sung. The first goes: : Chorus; 1st version : Chorus; 2nd version In Barney & Friends they used these lyrics: Mickey's Fun Songs and Sesame Street use these lyrics: = Racist versions = Harry C. Browne recorded a version in 1916 called \\"Nigger Love a Watermelon, Ha! Ha! Ha!\\". This version relied heavily on the offensive and widespread coon stereotype.  \\"Zip Coon\\"  Another contrafactum, \\"Zip Coon\\", sung to the same tune as \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", was popularized by Dixon and flourished during 1830s. This version was first published between 1829 and 1834 in either New York or Baltimore. All of the above performers claimed to have written the song, and the dispute is not resolved. Ohio songwriter Daniel Decatur Emmett is sometimes erroneously credited as the song's author. \\"Zip Coon\\" has a vocal range of an octave and a minor sixth. Both the verse and the chorus end on the tonic, and both begin a major third above the tonic. In the verse, the highest note is a fifth above the tonic and the lowest is a minor sixth below. In the chorus, the highest note is an octave above the last note, and the lowest is the last note itself. The song stays in key throughout. The song gave rise to the blackface minstrel show character Zip Coon. = More versions = \\"Zip Coon\\" has many different lyrical versions. Thomas Birch published a version in 1834, while George Washington Dixon published a version called \\"Ole Zip Coon\\" with different lyrics circa 1835. Both Birch's and Dixon's versions keep the same chorus and the first four stanzas: : Chorus : Chorus : Chorus In subsequent stanzas, both lyricists talk about events in the life of Andrew Jackson, Birch of President Jackson's battle with the Second Bank of the United States and Dixon of General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began, Dixon published a new version of \\"Zip Coon\\" with updated lyrics pertaining to the war: The chorus \\"Zip a duden duden duden zip a duden day\\" influenced the song \\"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" in Walt Disney's 1946 adaptation of Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus tales, Song of the South. Another version of \\"Old Zip Coon\\" with new self-referencing lyrics by David K. Stevens (1860‚Äì1946) was published in the Boy Scout Song Book (1920). Stevens' lyrics contain no direct racial references other than the title of the song itself: = Good Humor Controversy = In June 2020, Good Humor, purveyors of frozen dessert, posted information via social media about the racist history of ice-cream truck jingles such as, ‚ÄúTurkey in the Straw‚Äù. The tune has been playing from the speakers of ice-cream trucks nationwide for generations. In the early 1800s, the melody was attributed to the denigrating song, ‚ÄúZip Coon‚Äù, written by minstrel performer George Washington Dixon. The \\"Zip Coon\\" was a blackface character who parodied a free black man attempting to conform to white high society. The song‚Äôs artwork and sheet music are archived at the Library of Congress. The racist evolution of the tune continued with the 1916 release of the song, ‚ÄúNigger Love A Watermelon Ha! Ha! Ha!‚Äù through Columbia Records. The song was written by actor Harry C. Browne and played on the stereotypical depiction of african descendants‚Äô supposed knack for watermelon. This song was also written to the melody of ‚ÄúTurkey in the Straw‚Äù and became nationally famous by way of traveling blackface minstrel acts. As of August 2020, Good Humor and Wu-Tang Clan's RZA announced their collaboration to create a new tune for ice-cream trucks. With the endeavor, Good Humor and RZA aim to help drivers learn about the racist roots of \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" and how to replace the music box in the truck that plays it. The song is scheduled for release before September 2020. Performance history Phonograph record version by Clayton McMichen.

It was visited by Admiral Christopher Columbus on November 27, 1492, and then founded by the first governor of Cuba, the Spanish conquistador Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar on August 15, 1511. It is the oldest Spanish settlement in Cuba and was its first capital (the basis for its nickname Ciudad Primada, \\"First City\\"). Geography Baracoa is located on the spot where Christopher Columbus landed in Cuba on his first voyage. It is thought that the name stems from the indigenous Arauaca language word meaning \\"the presence of the sea\\". Baracoa lies on the Bay of Honey (Bah√≠a de Miel) and is surrounded by a wide mountain range (including the Sierra del Purial), which causes it to be quite isolated, apart from a single mountain road built in the 1960s.The Baracoa mountain range is covered with Cuban moist forests and Cuban pine forests. The municipality includes the villages of Barigua, Boca de Yumur√≠, Cabac√∫, Cayog√º√≠n, Jamal, Jaragua, Los Hoyos, Mabujabo, Mosquitero, Nibuj√≥n, Paso Cuba, Sabanilla, Santa Mar√≠a, Vega de Taco, and other minor localities. Baracoa has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification with high temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. , Climate Baracoa, Climate-Data.org Although there is are no true wet or dry seasons, there is a noticeably wetter stretch from October to December. History The original inhabitants of the island were Ta√≠no. They were eradicated by European diseases throughout the island. A local hero is Hatuey, who fled from the Spanish in Hispaniola and raised a Ta√≠no army to fight the Spanish in Cuba. According to the story Hatuey was betrayed by a member of his group and sentenced to burn at the stake. It is said that just before he died a Catholic priest tried to convert him so he would attain salvation; Hatuey asked the priest if Heaven was the place where the dead Spanish go. When he received an answer in the affirmative he told the priest that he would rather go to Hell. Cruz de Parra Christopher Columbus landed in Cuba in a place he named Porto Santo. It is generally assumed from his description that this was Baracoa, although there are also claims it was Gibara. But Columbus also described a nearby table mountain, which is almost certainly nearby El Yunque. He wrote in his logbook \\"the most beautiful place in the world ...I heard the birds sing that they will never ever leave this place...\\". According to tradition, Columbus put a cross called Cruz de la Parra in the sands of what would later become Baracoa harbor. Around 15 August 1511 (the official foundation day) Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar was appointed the first governor of Cuba and built a villa here and named the place 'Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n de Baracoa', thus making Baracoa the first capital of Cuba.History of Baracoa In 1518 it received the title of city and the first Cuban bishop was appointed here. As a result, several remains of the Spanish occupation can still be seen here, such as the fortifications El Castillo, Matach√≠n and La Punta and the cemetery. In the 16th and 17th centuries the isolated location made it a haven for illegal trade with the French and English. During the Jenkin's Ears War the newly organized Fixed Regiment of Havana appointed in 1744 as Baracoa war lieutenant Luis de Unzaga who managed, thanks to a network of confidants, Irish merchants and French military, to be warned of possible English attacks, which would allow Baracoa a certain peace and commercial prosperity between Haiti and Cuba despite the time of conflict Cazorla, Frank, G. Baena, Rosa, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019). The Governor Louis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States and in liberalism. Malaga Foundation. pages 44-50 . At the beginning of the 19th century many French fled here from the revolution of independence in Haiti, who started growing coffee and cocoa. The Bay of Honey with El Yunque towering in the background From the middle of the 19th century many expeditions of independence fighters landed here (including Antonio Maceo and Jos√© Mart√≠) which greatly helped the independence from Spain in 1902. Before the Cuban Revolution the only access was by sea, but in the 1960s a road from Guant√°namo named La Farola was built through the mountains, which was one of the showcases of the revolution. The road had already been planned by the Batista government, but never got built. The highest point of the road is at over 600 m and it passes over 11 bridges. Economy The main products in the region are banana, coconut and cacao. It is Cuba's main chocolate manufacturing area.Theobroma cacao trees are cultivated under groves of Royal palm on the banks of the Rio Duaba, Rio Yumuri. Ecotourism and birdwatching are important in Baracoa due to the Cuban moist forests. =Tourism= A cabin in the hills near Baracoa Street in the old city of Baracoa Sunset on the bay (El Yunque in background) The remote location at the eastern end of the Cuban island has kept the influence of mass tourism quite low, despite the idyllic location. Baracoa can be reached by bus from Santiago de Cuba (four hours) or by plane from Havana (two hours). To the east the Fuerte Matach√≠n (built in 1802) is still standing and contains houses and museums. To the west the Fuerte La Punta (built in 1803) houses a restaurant; there is a small beach next to the fort. The third fort, El Castillo, which sits on a steep hill with a commanding view of the town and both bays, is now Hotel El Castillo. The other hotels in Baracoa are Hotel Porto Santo, Hotel La Rusa, Hostal La Habanera and Villa Maguana. There are also a few casas particulares. The Catedral Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n houses the earings of the Cruz de la Parra, a cross that Cali is supposed to have brought from Spain. Although it has been carbon dated to approximately that period, it is made from a local type of wood, which means at least part of the story is not correct. There are two music venues near the central Parque Independencia, the touristy Flan de Queso and the more traditional Casa de la Flana. Nearby are the rivers Miel and Toa, the latter of which has many waterfalls, the best known of which is 'el Saltadero', which is 17 m high. The table mountain el Yunque (the anvil) is 10 km to the west of Baracoa. It is a remnant of a plateau and because of its isolation it houses several unique species of ferns and palms. The only official and easiest approach to climb it starts at campismo El Yunque (simple lodgings for Cubans only), where a guide is obligatory (about 15 euro). From Baracoa, it is possible to visit the Parque Nacional Alejandro de Humboldt located about 20 kilometers north. Salto Fino is the highest waterfall in the Caribbean, located in this municipality, is produced by a sudden drop in the Arroyo del Infierno (Hell's stream), a tributary of the Quibijan river. That river, along with 71 others, flows into the Toa river, which is the largest river in Cuba. The 305-meter-high Salto Fino waterfall is recorded as the 20th-highest water chute in the world. =Gastronomy= Baracoa has typical dishes, such as cucurucho, a mix of coconut and much sugar and other ingredients like orange, guava and pineapple and wrapped in a palm leaf. Another is Bac√°n, which is made from bananas and wrapped in a banana leaf. And of course there is much chocolate in this cocoa-producing region. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Baracoa had a population of 81,794. With a total area of , it has a population density of . Transport Baracoa is the eastern end of Carretera Central, a highway spanning the length of the island of Cuba for 1,435 km, that ends in the village of La F√©, Pinar del R√≠o Province. =Airport= Gustavo Rizo Airport is a regional airport that serves this town. This is a small airport that usually operates with national flights. Located west of the bay near the Hotel Porto Santo and about 4 km (2¬Ω miles) NNW of Baracoa. Although flights are infrequent, Cubana de Aviaci√≥n flies here from Santiago de Cuba and Havana. Notable residents Cuban artist Pablo Borges Delgado was born in Baracoa.

For the majority of his career he was known as Sir Herbert Austin, and the Northfield bypass is called \\"Sir Herbert Austin Way\\" after him. Background and early life thumbuprightHerbert Austin aged 38, 1905\\"Mr H Austin, who has for so many years been associated with the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company, Limited, and who is starting new works, where he will manufacture Austin Cars, at Longbridge, near Birmingham\\" Mr H Austin, who has been for so long associated with the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Co. of Adderley Park, Birmingham, advises us that he is leaving the Company, and is starting works on his own account situated at Longbridge, near Birmingham, where he will manufacture vehicles which are to be known as the ‚Äò‚ÄôAustin‚Äô‚Äô Cars. At first Mr Austin will turn out two sizes of tourist cars viz., a 15‚Äì20 hp and a 25‚Äì30 hp. both of which models will embody the best approved principles in design, and Mr Austin proposes to use only the highest grade of materials in their manufacture. Moderation is to govern the selling price, and Mr Austin hopes to make the car of his name a household word for reliability and good service. Captan Frank Kayser is associated with Mr Austin in the new undertaking and he will be assisted by a specially-selected staff, several of whom have been connected with him in the past. The works are of considerable extent, covering several acres, and are thoroughly suitable for the construction of automobiles of all types. Mr Austin hopes to have his first 25‚Äì30 hp car on the road by 1 December and to commence deliveries by the end of March 1906. Mr Austin sends us, in a tabulated form, an extremely interesting record gained by the cars which have been turned out by the Wolseley Company during his direction of that Company. This list bristles with gold and silver medals in all the leading reliability and consumption trials, exhibitions etc whilst in the speed events and hill-climbing contests, the number of winners makes a formidable show, these triumphs being in addition to the selection by the A.C.G.B.I. of the Wolseley racers in 1904 and 1905 for the Gordon Bennett Race. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Automotor Journal, 4 November 1905 Page 1366‚Äô‚Äô The portrait published with his announcement that he had left Wolseley and was setting up on his own account The son of a farmer, he was born in Little Missenden, Buckinghamshire in South East England, but the family moved to Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, Yorkshire in 1870 when his father was appointed farm bailiff.Lambert (1968), Chapter 1: Early Days Herbert Austin first went to the village school, later continuing his education at Rotherham Grammar School. In 1884, he emigrated to Australia, travelling with a maternal uncle, who lived in Melbourne but had recently returned to England on a family visit. They travelled to Australia by ship, via the Cape. Life in Melbourne He started work with his uncle who was the works manager at a general engineering firm, Mephan Ferguson, in North Melbourne. Two years later he joined Alex. Cowan & Sons, a Scottish paper business which had an agency for printing equipment and Crossley gas engines. Later he worked for the Langlands Foundry Company Limited in Yarra Bank, Melbourne, which made locomotive boilers, wheels and gold mining equipment.

During this time, he submitted a design for a swing bridge over the Yarra River at Spencer Street, Melbourne, for a competition organised by the Government of Victoria, but did not win. In December 1887, Austin took up his new appointment as manager of an engineering workshop owned by Richard Pickup Park, who was developing a new sheep-shearing machine for Frederick York Wolseley. On the strength of this new managership, he married Helen Dron in Melbourne on 26 December 1887. Born in Melbourne on 23 October 1866, she was the seventh daughter of Scottish parents. They were to have two daughters, Irene (born in 1891, later Mrs. Waite) and Zeta (later to become Mrs Lambert). Their only son, Vernon James Austin, was killed in action in France during the First World War on 26 January 1915. After Austin spent three months improving the sheep-shearing machine, he was asked to join The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company, in Sydney. Shortly after joining, he was sent to a sheep station at Avoca, Victoria to study the machines in use. Austin patented in his own name the improvements he made to the sheep- shearing machines and later sold the patents to the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company on 10 March 1893 in exchange for shares.

Difficulties with suppliers persuaded the Wolseley board to move assembly to England in 1893. Frederick Wolseley and Herbert Austin left John Howard in charge of the Australian operation and returned to England in November 1893. Austin set up a factory in Broad Street, Birmingham. Fredrick Wolseley resigned from the company in 1894.Lambert (1968), Chapter 2: Experimental Cars The Broad Street factory was not large enough, so Austin bought a bigger premises in Aston, Birmingham. Shearing machinery sales were highly seasonal, during slack periods in the year, they built bicycles. Looking for other products to even out the workload, Herbert Austin became interested in motor cars and built two different types of three-wheelers in his own time. A version of one of these was taken up by the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company and listed for sale in 1900, but the Wolseley board could see no profitable future for a motor industry. In 1901, Vickers bought Wolseley's car interests, taking Austin too, and naming the new business Wolseley Tool & Motor Company setting it up in Adderley Park, Birmingham. Herbert Austin retained his interest and ties with The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company.Lambert (1968), Chapter 3: Vickers and Wolseley He was chairman of their board from 1911‚Äì1933, when he retired shortly before his death. In 1905, still under an unexpired five-year contract, Austin resigned from the Wolseley Tool & Motor Company, taking some of the senior staff with him.Lambert (1968), Chapter 6: The Austin Motor Company is formed His brother Harry also joined him in this new venture, having worked with him at Wolseley in Birmingham. Austin raised capital of ¬£37,000 (¬£4,369,468.69 adjusted for inflation in 2018) and embarked on a search for a factory that could accommodate his idea for a new car manufacturer. He took over an old print works, still outside Birmingham, in Longbridge, which was then in the County of Worcestershire; Longbridge did not become a suburb of Birmingham until 1911 when the city's boundaries were expanded. The Austin car works at Longbridge was later to become one of the greatest car manufacturers in the world (also see Longbridge plant). Austin was producing seventeen different models by 1908. During the First World War Austin produced munitions and built Austin Village in Turves Green for his workers. The car business was difficult after World War I; the Austin company was threatened with bankruptcy in 1921 and a receiver was appointed. The \\"Baby Austin\\" was launched in 1922 and offered for sale at ¬£225 (¬£12,417.65 in 2018); putting it within the budget of customers who had never owned a car before. Its output reached 25,000 annually by 1925; the price was lowered each year. In 1931, the Austin 12/6 was introduced, followed by the Austin 12/4 in 1933. Military production The company turned its resources to the war effort in 1914 and, in 1917, Austin was knighted for his services and also received the Belgium Order of the Crown of Leopold II, for the employment of 3,000 Belgian refugees at Longbridge.Lambert (1968), Appendix 3 During World War II, the company specialised in making aircraft;Lambert (1968), Chapter 14: The End of a Career Horsa glider fuselages; specialist army vehicles; hydraulic motors for gun turrets; ammunition boxes, magazines for machine guns, tommy guns, Oerlikon anti- aircraft guns; marine engines for ships lifeboats; and pressings for jerrycans. =British shadow factories= Up until 1938, the Air Ministry had been headed by Lord Swinton, who at that point had been forced to resign his position by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain due to a lack of progress in re-arming the Royal Air Force. New minister Sir Kingsley Wood implemented a new plan to treble British aircraft production in the run up to the Second World War in two parts: *Development of nine new factories *Extension and extensions to existing factory complexes to allow either easier switching to aircraft industry capability, or production capacity expansion Underneath the plan, there was government funding for the building of these new production facilities, in the form of grants and loans. Key to the plan were the products and plans of Rolls-Royce Limited, whose Merlin engine powered many of the key aircraft being developed by the Air Ministry. Austin was placed in charge of implementing the scheme on the producers side, who were mainly motor vehicle manufacturers; while technical liaison with the aircraft industry was placed with Charles Bruce-Gardner. Grave of Lord and Lady Austin Parliamentary career From 1918‚Äì24, Austin served as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham King's Norton but never made a speech in the House of Commons. In 1936, he was created Baron Austin, of Longbridge in the City of Birmingham. In 1937, he received a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Birmingham. Lord Austin died from a heart attack and a bout of pneumonia. His only son Vernon had been killed in action in France in 1915 and the peerage became extinct upon his death. He and his wife also had two daughters, Irene (later to become Mrs. Waite) and Zeta (later to become Mrs. Lambert). He was buried with his wife Helen, Lady Austin in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Lickey, near his former home at Lickey Grange and the factory at Longbridge, close to both Bromsgrove and Birmingham.

One may speak of infinite divisibility, or the lack thereof, of matter, space, time, money, or abstract mathematical objects such as the continuum.  In philosophy  The origin of the idea in the Western tradition can be traced to the 5th century BCE starting with the Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus and his teacher Leucippus, who theorized matter's divisibility beyond what can be perceived by the senses until ultimately ending at an indivisible atom. The Indian philosopher Kanada also proposed an atomistic theory, however there is ambiguity around when this philosopher lived, ranging from sometime between the 6th century to 2nd century BCE. Atomism is explored in Plato's dialogue Timaeus and was also supported by Aristotle. Andrew Pyle gives a lucid account of infinite divisibility in the first few pages of his Atomism and its Critics. There he shows how infinite divisibility involves the idea that there is some extended item, such as an apple, which can be divided infinitely many times, where one never divides down to point, or to atoms of any sort. Many professional philosophers claim that infinite divisibility involves either a collection of an infinite number of items (since there are infinite divisions, there must be an infinite collection of objects), or (more rarely), point-sized items, or both. Pyle states that the mathematics of infinitely divisible extensions involve neither of these ‚Äî that there are infinite divisions, but only finite collections of objects and they never are divided down to point extension-less items. Zeno questioned how an arrow can move if at one moment it is here and motionless and at a later moment be somewhere else and motionless. In reference to Zeno's paradox of the arrow in flight, Alfred North Whitehead writes that \\"an infinite number of acts of becoming may take place in a finite time if each subsequent act is smaller in a convergent series\\": In physics Until the discovery of quantum mechanics, no distinction was made between the question of whether matter is infinitely divisible and the question of whether matter can be cut into smaller parts ad infinitum. As a result, the Greek word √°tomos (·ºÑœÑŒøŒºŒøœÇ), which literally means \\"uncuttable\\", is usually translated as \\"indivisible\\". Whereas the modern atom is indeed divisible, it actually is uncuttable: there is no partition of space such that its parts correspond to material parts of the atom. In other words, the quantum-mechanical description of matter no longer conforms to the cookie cutter paradigm. This casts fresh light on the ancient conundrum of the divisibility of matter. The multiplicity of a material object--the number of its parts--depends on the existence, not of delimiting surfaces, but of internal spatial relations (relative positions between parts), and these lack determinate values. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the particles that make up an atom--quarks and electrons--are point particles: they do not take up space. What makes an atom nevertheless take up space is not any spatially extended \\"stuff\\" that \\"occupies space\\", and that might be cut into smaller and smaller pieces, but the indeterminacy of its internal spatial relations. Physical space is often regarded as infinitely divisible: it is thought that any region in space, no matter how small, could be further split. Time is similarly considered as infinitely divisible. However, the pioneering work of Max Planck (1858-1947) in the field of quantum physics suggests that there is, in fact, a minimum measurable distance (now called the Planck length, 1.616229(38)√ó10‚àí35 metres) and therefore a minimum time interval (the amount of time which light takes to traverse that distance in a vacuum, 5.39116(13) √ó 10‚àí44 seconds, known as the Planck time) smaller than which meaningful measurement is impossible. In economics One dollar, or one euro, is divided into 100 cents; one can only pay in increments of a cent. It is quite commonplace for prices of some commodities such as gasoline to be in increments of a tenth of a cent per gallon or per litre. If gasoline costs $3.979 per gallon and one buys 10 gallons, then the \\"extra\\" 9/10 of a cent comes to ten times that: an \\"extra\\" 9 cents, so the cent in that case gets paid. Money is infinitely divisible in the sense that it is based upon the real number system. However, modern day coins are not divisible (in the past some coins were weighed with each transaction, and were considered divisible with no particular limit in mind). There is a point of precision in each transaction that is useless because such small amounts of money are insignificant to humans. The more the price is multiplied the more the precision could matter. For example, when buying a million shares of stock, the buyer and seller might be interested in a tenth of a cent price difference, but it's only a choice. Everything else in business measurement and choice is similarly divisible to the degree that the parties are interested. For example, financial reports may be reported annually, quarterly, or monthly. Some business managers run cash-flow reports more than once per day. Although time may be infinitely divisible, data on securities prices are reported at discrete times. For example, if one looks at records of stock prices in the 1920s, one may find the prices at the end of each day, but perhaps not at three-hundredths of a second after 12:47 PM. A new method, however, theoretically, could report at double the rate, which would not prevent further increases of velocity of reporting. Perhaps paradoxically, technical mathematics applied to financial markets is often simpler if infinitely divisible time is used as an approximation. Even in those cases, a precision is chosen with which to work, and measurements are rounded to that approximation. In terms of human interaction, money and time are divisible, but only to the point where further division is not of value, which point cannot be determined exactly. In order theory To say that the field of rational numbers is infinitely divisible (i.e. order theoretically dense) means that between any two rational numbers there is another rational number. By contrast, the ring of integers is not infinitely divisible. Infinite divisibility does not imply gap-less-ness: the rationals do not enjoy the least upper bound property. That means that if one were to partition the rationals into two non-empty sets A and B where A contains all rationals less than some irrational number (œÄ, say) and B all rationals greater than it, then A has no largest member and B has no smallest member. The field of real numbers, by contrast, is both infinitely divisible and gapless. Any linearly ordered set that is infinitely divisible and gapless, and has more than one member, is uncountably infinite. For a proof, see Cantor's first uncountability proof. Infinite divisibility alone implies infiniteness but not uncountability, as the rational numbers exemplify. In probability distributions To say that a probability distribution F on the real line is infinitely divisible means that if X is any random variable whose distribution is F, then for every positive integer n there exist n independent identically distributed random variables X1, ..., Xn whose sum is equal in distribution to X (those n other random variables do not usually have the same probability distribution as X). The Poisson distribution, the stuttering Poisson distribution, the negative binomial distribution, and the Gamma distribution are examples of infinitely divisible distributions ‚Äî as are the normal distribution, Cauchy distribution and all other members of the stable distribution family. The skew-normal distribution is an example of a non- infinitely divisible distribution. (See Dom√≠nguez-Molina and Rocha Arteaga (2007).) Every infinitely divisible probability distribution corresponds in a natural way to a L√©vy process, i.e., a stochastic process { Xt : t ‚â• 0 } with stationary independent increments (stationary means that for s < t, the probability distribution of Xt ‚àí Xs depends only on t ‚àí s; independent increments means that that difference is independent of the corresponding difference on any interval not overlapping with [s, t], and similarly for any finite number of intervals). This concept of infinite divisibility of probability distributions was introduced in 1929 by Bruno de Finetti.

It was built in 1855. It is a small, one-story house with a lantern on top and served primarily as a warning light for naval ships approaching the Washington Navy Yard. The lighthouse was discontinued in 1926, replaced by a small steel skeletal tower located nearby; this smaller tower was in use for ten years before being discontinued. After being dark for more than half a century, Jones Point Light was relit by a private concern in 1995, however, it was eventually put out again after ownership switched from the Daughters of the American Revolution Foundation to the National Park Service. Certain local efforts have called for the structure to be relit, but as of 2017, the only working lighthouse on the Potomac River is the Fort Washington Point Lighthouse, located five miles downriver. The lighthouse is located on Jones Point in Alexandria, and is part of Jones Point Park. Visitors can approach the lighthouse, but it is currently impossible to enter the building. The lighthouse is immediately north of the confluence of Hunting Creek and the Potomac River. The 1791-1792 survey of the boundaries of the District of Columbia began at a spot that was then at the tip of a cape at the Point. The south cornerstone from the boundary survey remains in the seawall adjacent to the lighthouse. In 1980, the lighthouse and the cornerstone were listed in the National Register of Historic Places as reference #80000352. The lighthouse is also listed in the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey as survey number VA-641. The listing shows lighthouse drawings and several black- and-white photos of the lighthouse prior to restoration.

It was discovered on 22 September 1998, by the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) at its Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, United States. The asteroid was named for American humorist Will Cuppy.  Orbit and classification  Cuppy orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,296 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins 7 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in October 1991.  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Cuppy measures 1.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.50. This is in line with a generic absolute magnitude-to-diameter conversion, which gives a diameter of approximately 2 kilometers for an absolute magnitude of 15.6 and an assumed albedo of 0.2 to 0.25, which is typical for stony asteroids of the inner asteroid belt. As of 2017, Cuppys composition, rotation period and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of American literary critic and humorist, Will Cuppy (1884‚Äì1949). He is known for his satirical books The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, How to Attract the Wombat, How to Become Extinct and How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes. The name was proposed by M. Walter. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 September 2003 ().

The Y-MP retained software compatibility with the X-MP, but extended the address registers from 24 to 32 bits. High-density VLSI ECL technology was used and a new liquid cooling system was devised. The Y-MP ran the Cray UNICOS operating system. The Y-MP could be equipped with two, four or eight vector processors, with two functional units each and a clock cycle time of 6 ns (167 MHz). Peak performance was thus 333 megaflops per processor. Main memory comprised 128, 256 or 512 MB of SRAM. Cray Y-MP Model D at NASA Center for Computational Sciences, GSFC The original Y-MP (otherwise known as the Y-MP Model D) was housed in a similar chassis to the horseshoe-shaped X-MP, but with an extra rectangular cabinet added in the middle (containing the CPU boards), thus forming a \\"Y\\" shape in plan view. The system could be configured with one or two Model D IOSs (Input/Output Subsystems) and an optional Solid State Disk (SSD) of 256 MB to 4GB capacity. The Y-MP had a measured GFLOPS of 2.144 and a peak GFLOPS of 2.667 in both 1988 and 1989. The Model D Y-MP was superseded in 1990 by the Y-MP Model E, which replaced IOS Model D with IOS Model E, providing twice the I/O throughput. The Y-shaped chassis was dropped in favor of one or two rectangular cabinets (each with a separate connected cabinet containing the liquid cooling system), depending on configuration. Maximum RAM was increased to 2 GB and up to eight IOSs were possible. Model E variants included the Y-MP 2E, Y-MP 4E, Y-MP 8E and Y-MP 8I, the latter being a single-cabinet (I for Integrated) version of the two-cabinet 8E. The 2E and 4E were later available with optional secondary air cooling. Cray Y-MP M90 (Ziegler) at the US National Cryptologic Museum The Y-MP M90 was a large-memory variant of the Y-MP Model E introduced in 1992. This replaced the SRAM of the Y-MP with up to 32 GB of slower, but physically smaller DRAM devices. The Y-MP M90 was also available in variants with up to two, four or eight processors (M92, M94 and M98 respectively). Later, the model name was abbreviated to the Cray M90 series. The Y-MP C90 series is described separately. Cray Y-MP processor board  Y-MP EL  In 1992, Cray launched the cheaper Y-MP EL (Entry Level) model. This was a reimplementation of the Y-MP architecture in CMOS technology, based on the S-2 design acquired by Cray from Supertek Computers in 1990. The EL was an air-cooled system with a completely different VMEbus-based IOS. EL configurations with up to four processors (each with a peak performance of 133 megaflops) and 32 MB to 1 GB of DRAM were available. The Y-MP EL was later developed into the Cray EL90 series (EL92, EL94 and EL98). The Y-MP EL came in a cabinet much smaller than the traditional room-filling Cray 2010√ó1270√ó810 mm (height √ó width √ó depth) and 635 kg in weight--and could be powered from regular mains power.  In popular culture  In the 1992 film Sneakers, whose story is centered around extremely high-level cryptography, two lead characters have an important discussion while sitting on a Cray Y-MP. In an episode of the television dramedy Northern Exposure titled \\"Nothing's Perfect\\", a character expresses her excitement at having finally gained access to a \\"CRAY Y-MP3\\" supercomputer.

It is also the title of the opening track on the first album in the series, Songs of Sanctuary. Concept Each Adiemus album is a collection of song-length pieces featuring harmonised vocal melody against an orchestra background. There are no lyrics as such, instead the vocalists sing syllables and \\"words\\" invented by Jenkins. However, rather than creating musical interest from patterns of phonemes (as in scat singing, or in numerous classical and crossover compositions), the language of Adiemus is carefully stylised so as not to distract the listener's attention from the pitch and timbre of the voice. Syllables rarely end in consonants, for example. In this respect it is similar to Japanese and several other languages. The core concept of Adiemus is that the voice should be allowed to function as nothing more than an instrument, an approach that was a trend in some New Age and World Music choral writing in the mid to late 1990s (compare, for example, Vangelis's score for the film 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), or Dogora, a symphonic suite by French composer √âtienne Perruchon). The word adiemus itself resembles the Latin word adeamus meaning \\"let us approach\\" (or \\"let us submit a cause to a referee\\"),Also meaning \\"to bring all together in rhythm.\\" or, is sometimes regarded as the future tense of the same verb, meaning \\"we will approach\\" or \\"we will take possession\\". Jenkins has said he was unaware of this.\\"The Story of Adiemus\\" , karljenkins.com The title also resembles two forms of the Latin verb audire (\\"to hear\\"): audiemus (\\"we shall hear\\") and audiamus (\\"let us hear\\"). Instrumentation and performers ;Scoring for Songs of Sanctuary: recorder, 8 percussion, 4 tom-toms, congas, cymbals, claves, floor tom, bass drum, mark tree, bass bell in C, cabassa, wood block, triangle, strings ;Scoring for Cantata Mundi:2 flutes (1 doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes (1 doubling on English horn), 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 6 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, claves, cowbell, g√ºiro, 2 cabasas, triangle, chenchen, Egyptian tabla, doholla, tom-tom, cymbals, shekere, xylophone, glockenspiel, bass marimba, bongos, rek, udu pot, tablas, sticks, pandeiro, timbales, surdo, bass drum, tamtam, suspended cymbals, tambourine, recorder, strings (featuring on album are also the violin, electro-acoustic percussion and gemshorn) ; Scoring for Dances of Time:7 singers, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 6 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, 8 percussionists: bass drum, bongos, cowbell, shekere, chocolho, cymbals, claves, congas, cabasa, castanets, dholak, g√ºiro, 5 low drums, low chekere, marimba, rainmaker, rek, snare drum, shaker, surdo, tom-tom, tabla, tamborim, tambourine, triangle, udo, wood block, xylophone, recorder, strings (featuring on album are also the electro-acoustic percussion and gemshorn) ; Scoring for The Eternal Knot: recorder, accordion, percussion, harp, strings (on album also the acoustic guitar, Uilleann pipes) ; Scoring for Vocalise: for voices and orchestra Session singer Miriam Stockley performed the vocal parts on the first four albums. Stockley was described by Jenkins as central to the Adiemus project due to her range and intonation; however, she was not re-engaged for Vocalise. Additional vocals were provided by Mary Carewe on all but Dances of Time, which saw the introduction of the Finnish Adiemus Singers (who would later appear on Vocalise). Extra vocals and the chorus effects were created by overdubbing multitracked recordings of the singers (in some cases up to 40 times) and varying the speed of the tape. The Songs of Sanctuary orchestra consisted of a string section augmented by various ethnic percussion instruments, with occasional further additions such as bells, a recorder and a quena. Mike Ratledge, with whom Jenkins had played in Soft Machine, contributed to the first album as well. Jenkins added brass and woodwind for Cantata Mundi, and continued to add more diverse instruments such as acoustic guitar on later albums. From Songs of Sanctuary to Dances of Time, the London Philharmonic Orchestra was used; Jenkins later formed his own Adiemus Orchestra to perform on The Eternal Knot recordings, returning to the London Philharmonic for Vocalise. =Singers= *Miriam Stockley *Mary Carewe *Pirjo Aittom√§ki *Mervi Hiltunen *Anna-Mari K√§h√§r√§ *Merja Rajala *S√§de Rissanen *Hanna-Riikka Siitonen *Mia Simanainen *Nina Tapio *Riikka Timonen Albums =Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary= \\"Adiemus\\" ‚Äì 4:01 \\"Tintinnabulum\\" ‚Äì 10:57 \\"Cantus Inaequalis\\" ‚Äì 3:13 \\"Cantus Insolitus\\" ‚Äì 5:35 \\"In Caelum Fero\\" ‚Äì 7:45 \\"Cantus Iteratus\\" ‚Äì 6:36 \\"Amat√© Adea\\" ‚Äì 5:12 \\"Kayama\\" ‚Äì 8:06 \\"Hymn\\" ‚Äì 2:38 =Adiemus II: Cantata Mundi= Released in 1997, and building on the style established in Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary, Jenkins broadens his musical approach to Cantata Mundi by including instrumentation and techniques from Eastern Europe, Arabia, and Asia.

European releases depict an insect hive in various shades of reds and yellows within an abstracted mechanical clock. A special edition release in Europe shows a winged figure ascending into the sky. Other releases use dolphins which are characteristic of Adiemus albums in some markets. =Adiemus III: Dances of Time= Released in 1998, this album is a tribute to the interrelationship between music and dance throughout history. As such, most tracks are composed in a traditional style of dance, including meter. In addition to the multitracked vocals used in the previous Adiemus recordings, Jenkins introduces the Finnish Adiemus Singers to perform the chorus to Miriam Stockley's lead.

The theme from \\"The Dagda\\" was borrowed from \\"Lacus Pereverantiae\\" from Jenkins's earlier work Imagined Oceans. The theme for \\"Isle of the Mystic Lake\\" is that of \\"Palus Nebularum\\" also from Imagined Oceans. \\"The Eternal Knot\\" went on to become the theme for \\"Benedictus\\" from Jenkins's mass The Armed Man. As is often the case with albums in the Adiemus project, releases in different regions may have different cover art. The cover Japanese release of Adieums IV: The Eternal Knot Has gold text and designs, including a dolphin, over a green background whereas other releases have white text over a Celtic knot on a bluish-green background. =Adiemus V: Vocalise= Released in 2003. In contrast to Jenkins's past Adiemus compositions, several of the tracks in this album are arrangements or variations on existing classical works. Additionally, the lyrics for some tracks are borrowed from religious texts or even the title of the piece rather than the invented phonetic language used exclusively in the preceding Adiemus albums. Adiemus V: Vocalise features the broadest range in musical styles and instrumentation of the series.

Jenkins follows conventions of tonality up to a point‚Äîhis harmony is derived from gospel and African music, decorated with functional dissonances such as suspensions and with greater freedom of movement between loosely related key areas. He avoids the most common time signatures, such as 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4, with a slow 3/2 and 6/8, 9/8 and 5/8 (Cantus Inaequalis from Songs of Sanctuary). \\"Free time\\" is also prominent, in this as well as the majority of new age projects. The percussion section, when used prominently, gives the pieces an upbeat, tribal-like rhythm. The sound of Adiemus is generally identified with new-age or Celtic music; The Eternal Knot is an explicitly Celtic-themed album that formed the sound-track for the S4C documentary The Celts. Audience Songs of Sanctuary was a commercial success, topping classical album charts. Though none of its successors has achieved the same critical acclaim, Adiemus acquired a cult following and maintained a place in mainstream consciousness through its use in TV commercials, in particular the track \\"Adiemus\\" in a Delta Air Lines commercial (for which the project began) and \\"Cantilena\\", from Cantata Mundi, in a Cheltenham & Gloucester TV commercial and \\"Chorale VI (Sol-Fa) Cantus Song of Aeolus\\", in a Toyota Prius PHV TV commercial. \\"Adiemus\\" was also the eighth feature track of the original 1997 Pure Moods album. It was used at the beginning and end of James Brandon's magic show \\"Imagine\\" which played at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas in the late 1990s and continues to be used as the soundtrack behind the Kubla Khan pillar show at the end of the Rotunda cave tour in Kartchner Caverns State Park in Arizona. \\"Adiemus\\" was used in the trailer to the Invisible Children's documentary film and featured in the titles of the 1996 BBC children's series Testament: The Bible in Animation. That same year, it was used in the Baywatch episode \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". \\"Tintinnabulum\\" was sampled in Solarstone's 1999 Ibiza trance anthem \\"Seven Cities\\".

Many of his novels feature the interactions of members of the fictional Irish-American Phelan family in Albany, New York. The novels make use of incidents from the city's history as well as the supernatural. Kennedy's works include The Ink Truck (1969), Legs (1975), Billy Phelan's Greatest Game (1978), Ironweed (1983), Roscoe (2002) and Chang√≥'s Beads and Two-Tone Shoes (2011). One reviewer said of Chang√≥'s Beads and Two-Tone Shoes that it was \\"written with such brio and encompassing humanity that it may well deserve to be called the best of the bunch\\". Kennedy also published a nonfiction book entitled O Albany!: Improbable City of Political Wizards, Fearless Ethnics, Spectacular Aristocrats, Splendid Nobodies, and Underrated Scoundrels (1983). Early life Kennedy was born and raised in Albany, New York, the son of William J. Kennedy and Mary E. McDonald. Kennedy was raised a Catholic, and grew up in the North Albany neighborhood. He attended Public School 20 and Christian Brothers Academy. Kennedy studied at Siena College in Loudonville, New York, from which he graduated in 1949. Career Kennedy began pursuing a career in journalism after college by joining the Post Star in [Glens Falls] as a sports reporter. He was drafted in 1950 and served in the US Army, where he worked for an Army newspaper in Europe. After his discharge, Kennedy joined the Albany Times Union as a reporter. He then relocated to Puerto Rico in 1956 and became managing editor of the San Juan Star, a new English language newspaper. While living in San Juan, he befriended the journalist and author Hunter S. Thompson, a friendship that continued throughout their careers. While in Puerto Rico Kennedy also met his mentor, Saul Bellow, who encouraged him to write novels. Kennedy, who had been eager to leave Albany, returned to his hometown and worked for the Albany newspaper the Times Union as an investigative journalist, writing stories exposing activities of Daniel P. O'Connell and his political cronies of the dominant Democratic Party. His use of Albany as the setting for eight of his novels was described in 2011 by book critic Jonathan Yardley as painting \\"a portrait of a single city perhaps unique in American fiction\\". Kennedy has received numerous honorary degrees, and was presented with the inaugural SUNY Medallion of Distinction in May 2012 by the Chancellor of the State University of New York, and so joined the ranks of the SUNY Distinguished Academy as a board-appointed Distinguished Professor. Kennedy lectured in creative writing and journalism from 1974 to 1982 at the University at Albany, becoming a full professor in 1983. He taught writing as a visiting professor at Cornell University during the 1982‚Äì1983 academic year. Awards Kennedy received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel Ironweed. He also won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2001, he received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award from the Tulsa Library Trust. William Kennedy received the Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award in 2007, which is given annually in Rockville, Maryland where F. Scott Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried. Personal life In Puerto Rico, Kennedy met and married Daisy (Dana) Sosa. They have three children. Kennedy resides in Averill Park, New York, a hamlet about 16 miles east of Albany. Bibliography =Fiction= *The Ink Truck. New York: Viking Press, 1969. The Albany Cycle *Legs.

Construction of the adjoining Late Gothic tower began in 1529, after the citizens of Leeuwarden demanded a tower taller than the one in the city of Groningen, the Martinitoren. In charge were Jacob van Aken (or Aaken) and, after his death, Cornelis Frederiksz. The tower's tilt began during construction. The builders tried to compensate for the tilt, but the project was stopped in 1532 (1533 according to another source). In 1595‚Äì1596, the then derelict church was demolished, but the tower remains. It consists mostly of brick, but the builders also used so-called Bentheim sandstone. There are two bells. A bell cast in 1633 by Hans Falck and a bell cast in 1637 by Jacob Noteman, weight .

The Golden Arches are the symbol of McDonald's, the global fast food restaurant chain. Originally, real arches were part of the restaurant design. They were incorporated into the chain's logo in 1962, which resembled a stylized restaurant, and in the current Golden Arches logo, introduced 1968, resembling an \\"M\\" for \\"McDonald's\\". They are widely regarded to be one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Downey, California, is the oldest operating McDonald's. It was the second restaurant to feature the Golden Arches design. History In 1952, brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald decided they needed a new building to house their hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California. They wanted this building to have an entirely new design which would achieve two goals: even greater efficiency, and an eye- catching appearance. They interviewed at least four architects altogether, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana, in late 1952. The arches had a direct bearing on the interviewing process and their choice of Meston: the first architect they interviewed objected to the arches the brothers wanted; a second wanted to change the arches; a third, prominent Los Angeles architect Douglas Honnold, said that if the brothers were going to tell him what to do they would be better off doing it themselves. Along with their practical knowledge, the brothers brought Meston a rough sketch of two half-circle arches drawn by Richard. The idea of an arch had struck Richard as a memorable shape to make their stand more visible. After considering one arch parallel to the front of the building, he had sketched two half-circles on either side of the stand. Meston, together with his assistant Charles Fish, responded with a design which included two yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \\"golden arches\\" even at the design stage. His design also included a third, smaller arch sign at the roadside with a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. According to architectural historian Alan Hess, \\"Meston and Fish turned the crude half-circle suggested by Richard McDonald's sketch into a tapered, sophisticated parabola, with tense, springing lines conveying movement and energy.\\" In the same article Hess added this footnote: \\"Who first suggested the parabola is unclear. Richard McDonald and George Dexter, the sign contractor who fabricated the first arches, recalled that Dexter came up with the idea and added them to the plans. Charles Fish, who did the working drawings and aided Meston in the design, attributes the idea to his familiarity with the form from a school project in which he used structural parabolas for a hangar. The form was one of many advanced engineering solutions, including folded plate roofs, that were in common currency.\\" The first franchised outlet bearing Meston's design opened in May 1953 in Phoenix, Arizona. Subsequent franchisees of the McDonald brothers were also required to use Meston's design, although Meston adapted the plans for each to the conditions and building codes of each site. In 1962, seeking to upgrade its image, the company sought a new logo. Fred Turner sketched a stylized \\"V\\", but the company's head of engineering and design, Jim Schindler, extended the \\"V\\" into an \\"M\\" resembling a McDonald's store viewed from an angle, with a red isosceles trapezoid \\"roof\\" serving as background for lettering. The Golden Arches used as an entranceway in Toronto, Ontario. The Golden Arches of McDonald's Canada incorporates a maple leaf into its design. While , the Golden Arches have remained in the logo, and as a commonly understood term for the company. This was partially due to Louis Cheskin's argument that the arches, which he likened to \\"mother McDonald's breasts\\", had \\"Freudian applications to the subconscious mind of the consumer and were great assets in marketing McDonald's food.\\" In Canada, all McDonald's stores and commercials have a maple leaf in the middle of the Golden Arches. Alan Hess summarized the arch's origin in Googie architecture and ultimate significance as follows: The term \\"Golden Arches\\" is sometimes used as metonym, symbolizing capitalism or globalization in phrases such as the \\"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\\", since McDonald's is one of the more prominent American corporations that have become global in their reach (along with Coca-Cola and Nike). Alternate versions The McDonald's in Sedona, Arizona The McDonald's arches in Sedona, Arizona were made turquoise when the yellow color had been deemed by government officials to be contrasting too much against the scenic red rock. Some McDonald's signs only have one arch, such as the one at 1035 E. Main Street in Montrose, Colorado, and at 2819 S. Olive Street in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The McDonald's restaurant at 610 Del Monte Ave., Monterey, California, has black arches. The McDonald's in North Scottsdale on 18241 N Pima Rd also has black arches. The McDonald's restaurant at 2172 Sunset Blvd. in Rocklin, CA has dark red arches. The restaurant at Champs-Elys√©es in Paris, France, includes a neon McDonald's sign with white arches. Also a recently built McDonald's in Bruges, Belgium, has the white arches. In 2018 and again in 2019, McDonald's turned the arches upside down on its social media accounts in celebration of International Women's Day, changing the \\"M\\" to a \\"W.\\" A McDonald's franchise operated by Patricial Williams in Lynwood, California, also flipped the arches on its sign. This prompted a mild backlash, with some arguing that the move was hypocritical due to the chain's underpaying of employees, and others observing that the \\"M\\" in the logo could just as easily stand for \\"men\\" as it could for \\"McDonald's.\\" See also *Golden Arches theory, which holds that \\"No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's\\" *McDonald's sign (Pine Bluff, Arkansas) References Category:McDonald's Category:Commercial logos Category:Yellow symbols Category:Symbols introduced in 1962 Category:Monograms ","title":"Golden Arches"},{"id":"855198","text":"A Colombian necktie () is a form of post-mortem mutilation in which the victim‚Äôs tongue is pulled through a deep cut beneath the jaw and left dangling on the neck. It first appeared in Colombia during the period known as La Violencia (1948‚Äì1958) as a method of psychological warfare designed to scare and intimidate. Its invention is sometimes erroneously attributed to drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. O. J. Simpson murder case During the trial of O. J. Simpson in 1994, an alternate murderer theory claimed hitmen murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The theory supposes that the hitmen were hired by drug dealers to whom Brown Simpson's friend and sometime houseguest Faye Resnick owed money. Evidence was presented that a Colombian necktie is often employed by Colombian drug dealers. Judge Ito barred this admission of testimony.

Most countries have both publicly and privately funded healthcare, but the degree to which it creates a quality differential depends on the way the two systems are managed, funded, and regulated. Some publicly funded universal healthcare systems deliver excellent service and the private system tends to be small and not highly differentiated. In other, typically poorer countries, the public health system is underfunded and overstretched, offering opportunities for private companies to deliver better-quality, albeit more expensive coverage. Canada In Canada, there are private and public healthcare providers with complete patient freedom of choice between which doctors and facilities to use. The public financing system, unofficially known as Medicare, consists of several different systems managed by each province or territory. The federal government distributes funds to the provinces for healthcare providing the provinces design their systems to meet certain criteria which they all do. Most people receiving care in Canada do not pay for their care beyond a monthly charge scaled according to family gross income. The medical provider gets paid a fixed fee for the care provided. The law bans the medical provider from charging patients to supplement their income from Medicare. Medical care providers can set their own fees that are higher than the Medicare reimbursement fee, but the patient must pay all the cost of care, not just the excess. About 70% of Canada's healthcare funding is via the public system. Another 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care) There are, however, financial disincentives that make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economic. Six of Canada's ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients' right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was defeated by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 2020. Some private hospitals operating while the national healthcare plan was instituted (for example, the Shouldice Hernia Centre in Thornhill, Ontario) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. (The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the \\"upper tier\\" of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.) Clinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners. Denmark Healthcare in Denmark, although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments. France Healthcare in France is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government. There are public as well as private hospitals. Patients pay a small copayment for certain aspects of care, but many people choose to cover the costs by taking out supplemental health insurance for which a small premium is payable each year. Thus, France also has a mixed delivery system with complete patient freedom of supplier choice. There is a two-tier funding arrangement, with compulsory funding of core medical services from taxation, with optional private insurance for the cost of copayments. Germany Healthcare in Germany has multiple sickness funds, either publicly owned or not-for-profit mutuals. Membership of a sickness fund is compulsory for everyone except certain people, who opt out of the insurance system altogether. Doctors are usually self-employed, and hospitals may be publicly owned, privately owned or not for profit. Ireland Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland is financed mainly by the state. However, all citizens have the option of buying additional private health insurance, provided by four companies. They include VHI, a large publicly owned insurer, operating, like all other insurers, community rating; people are insured at the same basic rate regardless of health status. The other insurers are Glo Healthcare, LAYA and Avivia. Also, much smaller restricted membership companies provide benefits for certain professions, such as police officers. There are public as well as private hospitals. Private patients are often treated in public hospitals, as all privately insured patients have an entitlement to use the publicly funded system. Netherlands Healthcare in the Netherlands is essentially single tier, with all persons accessing a common system of private and public providers with complete freedom of choice between providers. Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses. Insurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers. Thus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled. Singapore Healthcare in Singapore uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds. A government-sponsored and subsidized system of hospitals accepts all patients, with a guaranteed list of services. A parallel system of private hospitals provides services not available in public hospitals or available with extra amenities (such as private rooms and other boutique services). Singapore uses a universal insurance fund in which all citizens are required to participate, as a baseline. Seniors and certain groups are subsidised in their membership in the universal basic insurance fund. Optional additional supplementary insurance funds are available for purchase for elective coverage, such as for plastic surgery or for extra amenities in hospital. Spain Private insurance, private hospitals and private management of public hospitals exist in Spain, and coexist with hospitals completely run by the government. Public insurance guarantees universal coverage, with no expenditure from patients other than a fraction of prescription drug cost. Some private hospitals are only accessible with private insurance. The system is regularly ranked amongst the world's best. Switzerland Private health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland. Insurance companies are required to sell the compulsory basic health insurance at cost, and individuals who cannot afford the premium (based on a premium-to-income ratio) are provided with public cash subsidies. Public hospitals are subsidised, but there are also private hospitals that provide additional services, such as elective services. In addition to the compulsory basic health insurance, optional complementary and supplementary private insurance plans are available for purchase. United Kingdom The National Health Service (or NHS) provides universal coverage to all residents of the United Kingdom. Private healthcare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 11% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples. Conversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment (cosmetic surgery for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for- service alternative. Historically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business. Since the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see hospital choice in the NHS). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS's expense. As of August 2020, 53.6% of patients were waiting for more than 18 weeks.https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt- waiting-times/rtt-data-2020-21/#Jul20 As a result of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private healthcare sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. Dentistry is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). NHS dentistry can then be patchy, and some people may find that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality. There has always been a degree of private medicine conducted within NHS hospitals, with private work being done in those hospitals and the patient being accommodated in segregated accommodation. Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities. Whether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts. United States The United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers. Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance. The debate over healthcare reform in the United States has included a proposal for a public option or Medicare for all, a government-run insurance program, available to all US citizens, to compete with or replace private insurance plans.

Franks was launched on 7 December 1942 by Seattle- Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Martha F. W. Carr, a cousin of Acting Master's Mate Franks, and commissioned on 30 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander N. A. Lidstone in command. History Franks arrived at Pearl Harbor 25 October 1943 to prepare for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, for which she sortied 10 November. She screened escort carriers providing air cover for the Tarawa landings, then patrolled off Betio until 27 December, returning then to Pearl Harbor for a brief repair period. The destroyer was underway once more 22 January 1944 with the Southern Attack Force for the invasion of Kwajalein, during which she patrolled against submarines, as well as closing Ebeye Island for reconnaissance and bombardment. Again she replenished at Pearl Harbor, between 18 February and 4 March, then sailed for convoy and patrol duty in the Solomon Islands, arriving at Purvis Bay 15 March. Targets for Franks' reconnaissance and bombardment missions in March and April 1944 included Mussau, north of New Ireland; Kapingamaringi; and Bougainville. In May, screening minelayers in Buka Passage, Franks and contacted, attacked, and sank the on 16 May. Returning to the central Pacific the next month, Franks joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Guam from 12 July, and gave fire support to the assault troops who landed there 21 July. After replenishing at Eniwetok, Franks sailed back to the South Pacific to prepare for the invasion of the Palaus, off which she arrived 15 September. She served as screen and fighter-director ship, then covered the occupation of Ulithi 23 September. On 1 October 1944, Franks sailed from Manus, beginning a month and a half of operations in the Philippines screening escort carriers. She took part in the preinvasion strikes on Leyte and the landings there, then fought gallantly to protect the escort carriers in the Battle off Samar phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, coming under the pounding fire of Japanese battleships 25 October. After replenishing at Manus, she returned to Leyte late in November, and in December joined the fast carrier task force to cover the landings on Mindoro, and to conduct strikes in preparation for the Luzon assault of January 1945. Still screening the fast carriers, Franks took part in strikes on the Japanese home islands on 16 and 17 February 1945 on the eve of the invasion of Iwo Jima, then sailed from Ulithi 14 March for strikes on Ky≈´sh≈´ and the Nansei Shoto in preparation for the Okinawa operation. On 18 March her task force came under heavy enemy air attack, and Franks splashed at least one of the attackers, joining in the fire which brought several others down. Joining the battleship group, Franks closed the southern coast of Okinawa 24 March for a preinvasion bombardment, which hid the intention to land at Hagushi on the western coast. Franks cruised off Okinawa, serving as plane guard for carriers covering the landings 1 April, until 2 April, when she was badly damaged and her commanding officer was fatally injured in a collision with the battleship . She sailed at once for temporary repairs at Ulithi, from which she departed 13 April for overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Franks returned to the western Pacific on 17 August 1945 at Eniwetok, and on 3 September rendezvoused with the fast carrier task force for air-sea rescue and weather station duty for flights between Okinawa and Honsh≈´. She entered Tokyo Bay 13 September, and on 1 October sailed for the west coast. Franks was placed out of commission in reserve at San Pedro, California 31 May 1946, and sold for scrapping on 1 August 1973. Honors Franks received nine battle stars for World War II service.

Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980; Namgyal died of cancer in 1982. Cooke wrote an autobiography, Time Change (Simon & Schuster 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an urban historian. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published Seeing New York (Temple University Press 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (Daily News); and taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Birch Wathen, a New York City private school.

They were drawn to each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. Two years later, in 1961, their engagement was announced, but the wedding was put off for more than a year because astrologers in both Sikkim and India warned that 1962 was an inauspicious year for marriages. On March 20, 1963, Cooke married Namgyal in a Buddhist monastery in a ceremony performed by fourteen lamas. Wedding guests included members of Indian royalty, Indian and Sikkimese generals, and the U.S. Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith. Cooke renounced her United States citizenship as required by Sikkim's laws and also as a demonstration to the people of Sikkim that she was not an \\"American arm\\" in the Himalayas. She was dropped from the Social Register but the marriage was reported in National Geographic magazine. The New Yorker followed the royal couple on one of their yearly trips to America.

Any changes or advances that are available when building a ship are likely to be included, so it is rare to have two that are identical. Constructing one ship is also likely to reveal better ways of doing things and even errors. The second and later ships are often started before the first one is completed, launched and tested. Nevertheless, building copies is still more efficient and cost-effective than building prototypes, and the lead ship will usually be followed by copies with some improvements rather than radically different versions. The improvements will sometimes be retrofitted to the lead ship. Occasionally, the lead ship will be launched and commissioned for shakedown testing before following ships are completed, making the lead ship a combination of template and prototype, rather than expending resources on a prototype that will never see actual use.

Their large size and light weight require little effort to propel them. They became popular in the beach-themed films of the 1960s starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. These movies include Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, Beach Blanket Bingo and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini. Design Beach balls range from hand-sized to over across or larger. They generally have a set of soft plastic panels, with two circular end panels, one with an oral inflation valve, intended to be inflated by mouth or pump. A common design is vertical solid colored stripes alternating with white stripes. There are also other designs, including beach balls in a single solid color, promotional beach balls with advertisements or company slogans, as globes or as Emojis. Some manufacturers specify the size of their beach balls (which is often confused with the diameter) as the tip-to-tip length of a deflated ball (approximately half the circumference), or even the length of the panels before they have their ends cut and joined into a beach ball. Thus the actual diameter may be about \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} (‚âà 0.6366‚Ä¶) of the nominal size. Other sizes of beach balls exist, ranging from smaller to larger ones. There are beach balls that have a diameter of or even . The world's largest beach ball was made in London, England on May 30, 2017. It was carried by a barge on River Thames. It had a diameter of with the word \\"Baywatch\\" written all over it. It was produced by Paramount Pictures to promote the 2017 movie Baywatch. The record was registered by Guinness and the certificates were given to the members of the film's cast. Uses A couple playing with a beach ball in a 1985 Florida postcard. Beach ball sports include water polo and volleyball. While they are much less expensive than the balls used in professional sports, they are also much less durable, as most of them are made of soft plastic. Giant beach balls may be tossed between crowd members at concerts, festivals, and sporting events. Many graduates use beach balls as a prank during ceremonies, hitting them around the crowd. They are bounced around crowds at cricket, baseball and football games, but are frequently confiscated and popped by security. Some security personnel at these events might inspect the ball's interior after tearing it, most likely searching for illegal items (e.g. narcotics) that might be transported inside the beach ball. Guards may also do this so that the ball cannot enter the field and obstruct or distract players. This happened in August 1999, in a baseball game between the Cleveland Indians and the Los Angeles Angels, where the distraction caused by a beach ball on the field resulted in the Angels' defeat. Their light weight and stability make beach balls ideal for trained seals to balance on their noses, which has become an iconic scene.This Seal Doesn't Have Everyone's Approval - 03.05.90 - SI Vault Beach balls are also a popular prop used in swimsuit photography and to promote or represent beach-themed events or locations.

In Ireland and Britain it is mainly a kind of hillfort and also a kind of Atlantic roundhouse. The term comes from Irish d√∫n or Scottish Gaelic d√πn (meaning \\"fort\\"), and is cognate with Old Welsh din (whence Welsh dinas \\"city\\" comes). In some areas duns were built on any suitable crag or hillock, particularly south of the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. There are many duns on the west coast of Ireland and they feature in Irish mythology. For example, the tale of the T√°in B√≥ Flidhais features D√∫n Chiort√°in and D√∫n Chaoch√°in. Duns seem to have arrived with the Celts in about the 7th century BC. Early duns had near vertical ramparts made of stone and timber. There were two walls, an inner wall and the outside one. Vitrified forts are the remains of duns that have been set on fire and where stones have been partly melted. Use of duns continued in some parts into the Middle Ages.

It was founded in 1885 with the establishment of the Minneapolis Library Board by an amendment to the Minneapolis City Charter. Lumber baron and philanthropist T. B. Walker and other city leaders such as Thomas Lowry were members of the first library board. In 2008, after some financial difficulties, the library was merged into the Hennepin County Library system. At the time of its merger, the library included Central Library in downtown Minneapolis and fourteen branch libraries. Its collection numbered about 3.1 million items with about 2.2 million of these housed in the central library.According to the 2004 Minneapolis Public Library board report Central Library The atrium of the Central Library Interior of Central Library in 2006 Periodical stacks at the Central Library The predecessor of Minneapolis's public library was a private library called the Minneapolis Athen√¶um. It was organized by Minneapolis businessmen in 1859 as a subscription library,Minneapolis Athenaeum and its shares were traded on the local stock market. After T. B. Walker moved to Minneapolis he bought shares in the Athen√¶um and gave away memberships to it, promoting the idea of a free public library for the city. Other stock holders raised objections, but the technique worked and soon the city financed a free library for the public with a one mill property tax. When the Minneapolis Public Library was established in 1885 the Athen√¶um became a partner of it and still exists as a separate nonprofit organization sharing space with the library. Three central libraries have been built in Minneapolis, each replacing the last with a bigger and more up-to-date building. The first opened in 1889, the second in 1961 and the third and current building in 2006. On November 7, 2000, Minneapolis voters approved a $140 million package to improve library services, including funding a new Central Library building. The building was designed by Cesar Pelli, along with the Minneapolis firm Architectural Alliance, It opened to the public on May 20, 2006. At a cost of $250 per square foot, the library features a host of energy-efficient measures, including a roof garden and substantial daylight. While the building was under construction, most services were provided at the interim Central Library Marquette location, on two floors in Marquette Plaza (formerly the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis). Cost of providing an interim site while the old library was demolished and rebuilt exceeded $10 million. Until the 2002 closure and demolition of the old central library, the Minneapolis Planetarium found its home there, possessing a projector machine literally older than the space age itself (originally delivered and installed in 1954, three years before the launch of Sputnik I). In 2005, the Minnesota Legislature apportioned funding for a new planetarium, then planned to be on the roof of the new Central Library building.Minnesota Planetarium official site Instead, the planetarium is now planned to be part of a new Bell Museum of Natural History building, on the University of Minnesota's Saint Paul campus.Bell Museum official site Community libraries The first two branches of the Minneapolis Public Library opened in 1890, one each on the north and south sides of Minneapolis. A branch in the basement of North High School opened on February 27, 1890, and one at 17th and Franklin Ave on April 23.Benidt, Bruce Weir, The Library Book, Centennial History of the Minneapolis Public Library, 1984, p.53 By 2002 there were fourteen branches or community libraries. Each library had a staff member who was assigned to local schools to discuss the services available at the library. The 2002 referendum also included funds to renovate community libraries, supplementing an existing program.Outlook 2010 master plan The community libraries and their renovation status are: * East Lake Community Library, built 1976, renovated 2007Minneapolis Public Library: East Lake * Franklin Community Library, built 1914, renovated 2005Minneapolis Public Library: Franklin Library * Hosmer Community Library, built 1916, renovated 1997Minneapolis Public Library: Hosmer * Linden Hills Community Library, built 1931, renovated 2002Minneapolis Public Library: Linden Hills * Nokomis Community Library, built 1968, renovated 2009‚Äì2011Minneapolis Public Library: Nokomis * North Regional Community Library, built 1971, renovated 2007Minneapolis Public Library: North Regional * Northeast Community Library, built 1973, reopened after renovation in 2011Minneapolis Public Library: Northeast RFP for renovation * Pierre Bottineau Community Library, built 2003 in the Grain Belt Brewery complex to replace an older storefront libraryMinneapolis Public Library: Pierre Bottineau * Roosevelt Community Library, built 1927, renovated and expanded 2013 Minneapolis Public Library: Roosevelt Library * Southeast Community Library, built 1963HClib.org * Sumner Community Library, built 1915, renovated 2005Minneapolis Public Library: Sumner * Walker Community Library, first built in 1915 (original building now privately owned), a replacement was built in 1981, which was demolished and replaced by a building that opened in 2014 * Washburn Community Library, built 1970, expanded 1992, renovated 2014Minneapolis Public Library: Washburn * Webber Park Community Library, built 1980, razed in 2013.

Many of the buildings built by the Minneapolis Public Library system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In some cases, the libraries have been demolished and moved to new, more modern buildings. * East Lake Community Library, original building at 2916 East Lake Street (since moved to 2727 East Lake Street). The building now houses a liberal political products store. * Franklin Community Library, current building at 1314 East Franklin Ave. * Linden Hills Branch Library, current building at 2900 W. 43rd St. * Minneapolis Public Library, North Branch, original building at 1834 Emerson Ave. N. The North branch was closed not long after the much larger North Regional Library opened at 1315 Lowry Ave. N. about a mile away. * Roosevelt Community Library, current building at 4026 28th Ave. S. * Sumner Branch Library, current building at 611 Emerson Ave. N. * Thirty-sixth Street Branch Library, current building at 347 E. 36th. St., since renamed to Hosmer Community Library * Walker Branch Library, original building at 2901 Hennepin Ave. S. (since moved across the street to 2880 Hennepin Avenue) Some had suggested that the Walker library be moved back to its original building as it was vacant and the new underground facility has been dogged by maintenance issues; however the original library building is still privately owned. Of this list, all but the North Branch library were built under the leadership of the city's head librarian, Gratia Countryman. Franklin, Sumner, and Thirty- Sixth Street were built with funds from Andrew Carnegie. Cataloging Unusually for a public library, the Minneapolis Public Library used the Library of Congress Classification. Prior to 1969 it used the Dewey Decimal System, although around 1890, the library switched to the early and short- lived Putnam Classification System, developed by Minneapolis librarian Herbert Putnam. He later became Librarian of Congress, and revised his Putnam system into the current Library of Congress classification system.Andy Sturdevant. \\"Cracking the spine on Hennepin County Library's many hidden charms\\". MinnPost, 02/05/14. 2000‚Äì2008 =2000 referendum= In 2000 Minneapolis voters approved a $140 million package to fund a new $110 million Central Library building, and spend $30 million on improvements to community libraries. The referendum began as a framework for discussion called Outlook Twenty Ten: A Discussion Plan to Improve All Minneapolis Community Libraries, submitted to the Minneapolis Public Library Board in July 1999, and drafted in anticipation of voters approving the referendum. The framework was submitted to the board by Amy Ryan, Chief of Community Libraries. When the referendum was approved, the Library Board turned to the plan which contained a profile of each of the fourteen community libraries, including highlights of patron surveys. It also contained at least three suggestions for every community library, entitled Options 'A', 'B', 'C' and onward. An update on the plan came out in 2004. =Adamson v. Minneapolis Public Library= Adamson v. Minneapolis Public Library was a civil complaint of 23 March 2003 by a dozen librarians against the library's management for a claimed failure to prevent sexual harassment over many years by library patrons having unlimited use of library computers for accessing pornography. The case followed an EEOC determination on 23 May 2001 that \\"the Respondent did subject the Charging Party to sexually hostile work environment. This is in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.\\"EEOC Determination Re: Unrestricted Internet Access Policy of Minneapolis Public Library Creates Sexually Hostile Work Environment The case settled when the library agreed to pay the plaintiffs $435,000 and to take corrective action to prevent further harassment. =Funding crisis and merger= Despite city funding and some private support, the library had suffered from reduced funding from external sources, including the federal government and Local Government Aid (LGA) from the State of Minnesota. In the recession of the 2000s following the Dot-com bubble, hours were drastically cut and money for acquisitions sharply declined. Because Minnesota library card holders could borrow from other systems in the state, MPL also duplicated services offered by Hennepin County Library (HCL), which saw shared use by MPL patrons. This was especially apparent on Mondays, when Minneapolis libraries were closed.1 + 1 A Report to the Minneapolis Public Library Trustees by the Library Advisory Committee In 2007, the Minneapolis Library Board agreed to pursue a merger with the county system. The Minneapolis Library Board and Minneapolis City Council approved the merger in March 2007, the Hennepin County Board approved the merger in April 2007, and on May 19, 2007 the Minnesota State Legislature approved a bill merging the systems during 2008. The merged system is the Hennepin County Library with 41 locations. On January 1, 2008, the library was merged into the Hennepin County Library. The last meeting of the Minneapolis Public Library Board of Trustees took place on December 19, 2007.

He is best known for his work on the DC Comics characters Sgt. Rock and Hawkman. He is also known for working on his own creations, such as Tor, Son of Sinbad, and the Viking Prince, and, with writer Robin Moore, the comic strip Tales of the Green Beret. Two of Kubert's sons, Andy Kubert and Adam Kubert, themselves became recognized comic book artists, as did many of Kubert's former students, including Stephen R. Bissette, Amanda Conner, Rick Veitch, Eric Shanower, Steve Lieber, and Scott Kolins. Kubert was inducted into the Harvey Awards' Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1998. Early life Kubert was born September 18, 1926 to a Jewish family in Jezierzany in southeast Poland (now Ozeryany in Ukraine). He was the son of Etta (n√©e Reisenberg) and Jacob Kubert. He emigrated to Brooklyn, New York City, United States, at age two months with his parents and his two-and-a- half-year-old sister Ida. Raised in the East New York neighborhood, the son of a kosher butcher, Kubert started drawing at an early age, encouraged by his parents. In his introduction to his graphic novel Yossel, Kubert wrote, \\"I got my first paying job as a cartoonist for comic books when I was eleven-and-a- half or twelve years old. Five dollars a page. In 1938, that was a lot of money\\". Another source, utilizing quotes from Kubert, says in 1938, a school friend who was related to Louis Silberkleit, a principal of MLJ Studios (the future Archie Comics), urged Kubert to visit the company, where he began an unofficial apprenticeship and at age 12 \\"was allowed to ink a rush job, the pencils of Bob Montana's [teen-humor feature] Archie\\". Author David Hajdu, who interviewed Kubert and other comics professionals for a 2008 book, reported, however, that, \\"Kubert has told varying versions of the story of his introduction to the comics business at age ten, sometimes setting it at the comics shop run by Harry \\"A\\" Chesler, sometimes at MLJ; however, MLJ did not start operation until 1939, when Kubert was thirteen\\".Hajdu, David. The Ten- Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How it Changed America, page 357. New York, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2008. ; . Kubert attended Manhattan's High School of Music and Art. During this time he and classmate Norman Maurer, a future collaborator, would sometimes skip school in order to see publishers. Kubert began honing his craft at the Chesler studio, one of the comic-book packagers that had sprung up in the medium's early days to supply outsourced comics to publishers. Career =Early career= Kubert's first known professional job was penciling and inking the six-page story \\"Black-Out\\", starring the character Volton, in Holyoke Publishing's Catman Comics #8 (March 1942; also listed as vol. 2, #13). He would continuing drawing the feature for the next three issues, and was soon doing similar work for Fox Comics' Blue Beetle. Branching into additional art skills, he began coloring the Quality Comics reprints of future industry legend Will Eisner's The Spirit, a seven-page comics feature that originally ran as part of a newspaper Sunday supplement. =1940s and 1950s= Kubert's first work for DC Comics, where he would spend much of his career and produce some of his most notable art, was penciling and inking the 50-page \\"Seven Soldiers of Victory\\" superhero-team story in Leading Comics #8 (Fall 1943), published by a DC predecessor company, All-American Publications. Throughout the decade, Kubert's art would appear in comics from Fiction House, Avon, and Harvey Comics, but he otherwise worked exclusively for All-American and DC. Kubert's long association with the Hawkman character began with the story \\"A Hot Time in the Old Town\\" in The Big All-American Comic Book (1944). Kubert drew several Hawkman stories in that title as well as in All Star Comics. He and Irwin Hasen drew the debut of the Injustice Society in All Star Comics #37 (Oct. 1947) in a tale written by Robert Kanigher.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 56: \\"In Robert Kanigher's story, featuring art by Irwin Hasen and Joe Kubert, a cabal of villains united as the Injustice Society of the World and took revenge on the JSA's assembled do-gooders.\\" The Kanigher/Kubert team created the Thorn in Flash Comics #89 (Nov. 1947).Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 57: \\"Writer Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert presented a female twist on Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the Thorn.\\" In the 1950s, he became managing editor of St. John Publications, where he, his old classmate Norman Maurer, and Norman's brother Leonard Maurer produced the first 3-D comic books, starting with Three Dimension Comics #1 (Sept. 1953 oversize format, Oct. 1953 standard-size reprint), featuring Mighty Mouse. According to Kubert, it sold a remarkable 1.2 million copies at 25 cents apiece at a time when comics cost a dime. At St. John, writer Norman Maurer and artist Kubert created the enduring character Tor, a prehistoric-human protagonist who debuted in the comic 1,000,000 Years Ago (Sept. 1953). Tor immediately went on to star in 3-D Comics #2-3 (Oct.-Nov. 1953), followed by a titular, traditionally 2-D comic-book series, written and drawn by Joe Kubert, that premiered with issue #3 (May 1954). The character has since appeared in series from Eclipse Comics, Marvel Comics' Epic imprint, and DC Comics through at least the 1990s. Kubert in the late 1950s unsuccessfully attempted to sell Tor as a newspaper comic strip. The Tor samples consisted of 12 daily strips, reprinted in six pages in Alter Ego vol. 3 #10 and later expanded to 16 pages in DC Comics' Tor #1. He contributed work to Avon Periodicals, where he did science-fiction stories for Strange Worlds and other titles. For EC Comics, Kubert drew a few stories for Harvey Kurtzman's Two-Fisted Tales alongside EC stalwarts Wally Wood, Jack Davis, and John Severin. =DC Comics and Sgt. Rock= Beginning with Our Army at War #32 (March 1955), Kubert began to freelance again for DC Comics, in addition to Lev Gleason Publications and Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics. By the end of the year he was drawing for DC exclusively. DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned Kubert, Robert Kanigher, and Carmine Infantino to the company's first attempt at reviving superheroes: an updated version of the Flash that would appear in Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956). The eventual success of the new, science-fiction oriented Flash heralded the wholesale return of superheroes, and the beginning of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books.Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 80: \\"The arrival of the second incarnation of the Flash in [Showcase] issue #4 is considered to be the official start of the Silver Age of comics.\\" In the coming years, Kubert would work on such characters as the medieval adventurer the Viking Prince and features starring Sgt. Rock and The Haunted Tank in the war comic G.I. Combat. He and writer Gardner Fox created a new version of Hawkman in The Brave and the Bold #34 (Feb.‚ÄìMarch 1961) with the character receiving his own title three years later.McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 102: \\"DC's...renaissance soared to new heights with the return of Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert...ushered in a pair of Winged Wonders that, costumes aside, were radically different from their Golden Age predecessors.\\" Kubert's work on Hawkman and in G.I. Combat would become known as his signature efforts. Kubert's main collaborator on the war comics was writer/editor Kanigher. Their work together on Sgt. Rock is considered a memorable contribution to the comics medium.Daniels, \\"Back to the Battlefield\\", p. 104: \\"The most famous Kanigher-Kubert collaboration involved Sgt. Rock, who has gone on to become a part of our collective mythology as the archetype of the gruff, cynical, good- hearted noncommissioned officer.\\" They introduced Enemy Ace in Our Army at War #151 (Feb. 1965).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 114: \\"This landmark issue...presented a very different look at war through the eyes of Enemy Ace Rittmeister Hans von Hammer. Writer/editor Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert based von Hammer on German WWI pilot Manfred von Richtofen a.k.a. the \\"Red Baron\\".\\" From 1965 through 1967 he collaborated with author Robin Moore on the syndicated daily comic strip Tales of the Green Beret for the Chicago Tribune. Kubert served as DC Comics' director of publications from 1967 to 1976. He made the Unknown Soldier the lead feature of Star Spangled War Stories with issue #151 (June‚ÄìJuly 1970)McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p.140: \\"This war anthology series found its most recognizable face when Joe Kubert wrote, drew, and edited the first of a slew of...Unknown Soldier [stories].\\" and initiated titles based on such Edgar Rice Burroughs properties as TarzanMcAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 151 \\"Tarzan enjoyed a prolific period in comics when DC acquired the rights to novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic ape-man. Much of that success should be attributed to writer, artist, and editor Joe Kubert, a lifelong Tarzan fan whose gritty, expressive style was perfect for the jungle hero.\\" and Korak. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Kubert's \\"scripts and artwork ranked among the most authentic and effective ever seen.\\"Daniels, \\"Looking Backward\\", p. 166 DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz stated in 2010 that \\"Joe Kubert produced an adaptation that Burroughs aficionados could respect.\\"Levitz, \\"The Bronze Age 1970-1984\\", p. 449 Kubert supervised the production of the comic books Sgt. Rock and Weird Worlds. While performing supervisory duties he continued to draw for some books, notably Tarzan from 1972 to 1975 and drew covers for Rima the Jungle Girl from 1974 to 1975. He edited Limited Collectors' Edition #C‚Äì36 which features stories from the Book of Genesis adapted by writer Sheldon Mayer and artist Nestor Redondo. Kubert and Kanigher created Ragman in the first issue (Aug.‚ÄìSept. 1976) of that character's short-lived ongoing series.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 171 \\"Writer Robert Kanigher's origin of the frayed hero was pieced together into moody, coarse segments by Joe Kubert and Nestor, Frank, and Quico Redondo.\\" =The Kubert School= The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art was founded in September 1976Schelly, pp. 186-195 by Kubert and his wife Muriel in Dover, New Jersey's former high school, whose tall windows offered optimal lighting. Its first graduating class of 1978 included Stephen R. Bissette, Thomas Yeates, and Rick Veitch. Kubert taught a number of students who later became notable professionals, including Amanda Conner, Eric Shanower, Steve Lieber, and Scott Kolins. =Later career= Joe Kubert at the Exhibition: Joe, Adam and Andy Kubert, Heroes, The Israeli Cartoon Museum, Holon, Israel, 2011 Joe, Adam and Andy Kubert, Heroes, The Israeli Cartoon Museum, Holon, Israel, 2011, Display View Kubert provided art for several anniversary issues of key DC titles. He and writer Paul Levitz crafted a Hawkman story in Detective Comics #500 (March 1981).Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 193 Kubert was one of the artists on the double-sized Justice League of America #200 (March 1982) as well as Batman #400 (Oct. 1986).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 221: \\"Batman celebrated the 400th issue of his self-titled comic with a blockbuster featuring dozens of famous comic book creators and nearly as many infamous villains. Written by Doug Moench, with an introduction by novelist Stephen King...[it was] drawn by George P√©rez, Bill Sienkiewicz, Arthur Adams, Joe Kubert, Brian Bolland, and others.\\" He wrote and drew a collection of faith-based comic strips beginning in the late 1980s for Tzivos Hashem, the Lubavitch children's organization, and Moshiach Times magazine. The stories, \\"The Adventures of Yaakov and Isaac\\", were based on biblical references but were not Bible stories. Kubert made a return to writing and drawing in 1991 with the Abraham Stone graphic novel Country Mouse, City Rat for Malibu Comics' Platinum Editions. He returned to the character for two more stories, Radix Malorum and The Revolution published by Epic Comics in 1995. Also for Epic Comics, he delivered the four-issue Tor miniseries in 1993. Fax from Sarajevo, initially released as a 207-page hardcover book in 1996 and two years later as a 224-page trade paperback was published by Dark Horse Comics. The non-fiction book originated as a series of faxes from European comics agent Ervin Rustemagiƒá during the Serbian siege of Sarajevo. Rustemagiƒá and his family, whose home and possessions in suburban Dobrinja were destroyed, spent two-and-a-half years in a ruined building, communicating with the outside world via fax when they could. Friend and client Kubert was one recipient. Collaborating long-distance, they collected Rustemagiƒá's account of life during wartime, with Kubert and editor Bob Cooper turning the raw faxes into a somber comics tale. Kubert drew the first issue of Stan Lee's Just Imagine... limited series (2001)Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 300: \\"The series consisted of thirteen prestige format books and started with Batman, drawn by art legend Joe Kubert.\\" and two pencil- illustrated graphic novels, Yossel: April 19, 1943 (2003) and Jew Gangster (2005), for IBooks. In 2003, Kubert returned to the Sgt. Rock character, illustrating Sgt. Rock: Between Hell and a Hard Place, a hardcover graphic novel written by Brian Azzarello. Kubert drew Tex, The Lonesome Rider, written by Claudio Nizzi and published by SAF Comics in 2005, and then wrote and drew Sgt. Rock: The Prophecy, a six-issue miniseries in 2006. In the mid-2000s, he was the artist for PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly, a United States Army magazine with comic-book elements that stresses the importance of preventive maintenance of vehicles, arms, and other ordnance. In 2008, Kubert returned to his Tor character with a six-issue limited series published by DC Comics entitled Tor: A Prehistoric Odyssey. In 2009, Kubert contributed a new Sgt. Rock story for Wednesday Comics, published by DC.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 338: \\"The [series] contained fifteen continuous stories, including a new Sgt. Rock saga drawn by the legendary Joe Kubert and written by his son Adam.\\" His son, Adam, wrote the story, his first foray at scripting. In 2011, Joe Kubert wrote the introduction and drew the lenticular 3-D front cover for Craig Yoe's Amazing 3-D Comics! Kubert inked his son Andy's pencils on the first two issues of DC Universe: Legacies, a 10 issue series chronicling the history of the DC Universe. and the Before Watchmen: Nite Owl limited series. The first two issues of Before Watchmen: Nite Owl were released before Kubert's death. The other two were released posthumously.

It was composed using rime royale and probably completed during the mid-1380s. Many Chaucer scholars regard it as the poet's finest work. As a finished long poem it is more self-contained than the better known but ultimately unfinished The Canterbury Tales. This poem is often considered the source of the phrase: \\"all good things must come to an end\\" (3.615). Although Troilus is a character from Ancient Greek literature, the expanded story of him as a lover was of Medieval origin. The first known version is from Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure's poem Roman de Troie, but Chaucer's principal source appears to have been Boccaccio, who re-wrote the tale in his Il Filostrato. Chaucer attributes the story to a \\"Lollius\\" (whom he also mentions in The House of Fame), although no writer with this name is known. Chaucer's version can be said to reflect a less cynical and less misogynistic world-view than Boccaccio's, casting Criseyde as fearful and sincere rather than simply fickle and having been led astray by the eloquent and perfidious Pandarus. It also inflects the sorrow of the story with humour. The poem had an important legacy for later writers. Robert Henryson's Scots poem The Testament of Cresseid imagined a tragic fate for Criseyde not given by Chaucer. In historical editions of the English Troilus and Criseyde, Henryson's distinct and separate work was sometimes included without accreditation as an \\"epilogue\\" to Chaucer's tale. Other texts, for example John Metham's Amoryus and Cleopes (c. 1449), adapt language and authorship strategies from the famous predecessor poem.Richard Utz, \\"Writing Alternative Worlds: Rituals of Authorship and Authority in Late Medieval Theological and Literary Discourse.\\" In: Creations: Medieval Rituals, the Arts, and the Concept of Creation. Ed. Sven Rune Havsteen, Nils Holger Petersen, Heinrich W. Schwab, and Eyolf √òstrem. Turnhout: Brepols, 2007, pp. 121‚Äì38. Shakespeare's tragedy Troilus and Cressida, although much blacker in tone, was also based in part on the material. Troilus and Criseyde is usually considered to be a courtly romance, although the generic classification is an area of significant debate in most Middle English literature. It is part of the Matter of Rome cycle, a fact which Chaucer emphasizes.C. S. Lewis, Selected Literary Essays, pp. 30‚Äì31, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1969. Characters *Achilles, a Greek warrior *Antenor, a soldier held captive by the Greeks, traded for Criseyde's safety, eventually betrays Troy *Calchas, a Trojan prophet who joins the Greeks *Criseyde, Calchas' daughter *Diomede, woos Criseyde in the Greek Camp *Helen, wife to Menelaus, lover of Paris *Pandarus, Criseyde's uncle, who advises Troilus in the wooing of Criseyde *Priam, King of Troy *Cassandra, Daughter of Priam, a prophetess at the temple of Apollo *Hector, Prince of Troy, fierce warrior and leader of the Trojan armies *Troilus, Youngest son of Priam, and wooer of Criseyde *Paris, Prince of Troy, lover of Helen *Deiphobus, Prince of Troy, aids Troilus in the wooing of Criseyde Synopsis Calchas, a soothsayer, foresees the fall of Troy and abandons the city in favour of the Greeks; his daughter, Criseyde, receives some ill will on account of her father's betrayal. Troilus, a warrior of Troy, publicly mocks love and is punished by the God of Love by being struck with irreconcilable desire for Criseyde, whom he sees passing through the temple. With the help of sly Pandarus, Criseyde's uncle, Troilus and Criseyde begin to exchange letters. Eventually, Pandarus develops a plan to urge the two into bed together; Troilus swoons when he thinks the plan is going amiss, but Pandarus and Criseyde revive him. Pandarus leaves, and Troilus and Criseyde spend a night of bliss together. Calchas eventually persuades the Greeks to exchange a prisoner of war, Antenor, for his daughter Criseyde. Hector, of Troy, objects; as does Troilus, although he does not voice his concern. Troilus speaks to Criseyde and suggests they elope but she offers a logical argument as to why it would not be practical. Criseyde promises to deceive her father and return to Troy after ten days; Troilus leaves her with a sense of foreboding. Upon arriving in the Greek camp, Criseyde realizes the unlikeliness of her being able to keep her promise to Troilus. She writes dismissively in response to his letters and on the tenth day accepts a meeting with Diomede, and listens to him speak of love. Later, she accepts him as a lover. Pandarus and Troilus wait for Criseyde: Pandarus sees that she will not return and eventually Troilus realizes this as well. Troilus curses Fortune, even more so because he still loves Criseyde; Pandarus offers some condolences. The narrator, with an apology for giving women a bad name, bids farewell to his book, and briefly recounts Troilus's death in battle and his ascent to the eighth sphere, draws a moral about the transience of earthly joys and the inadequacy of paganism, dedicates his poem to John Gower and Strode, asks the protection of the Trinity, and prays that we be worthy of Christ's mercy.Scene outline of Chaucer's Troilus, by Donald R. Howard & James Dean, eds., Signet edition, 1976. Inspiration The Canticus Troili is a translation of Petrarch's Sonnet 132 from Il Canzoniere.

It extends from roughly 43rd Street to 53rd Streets, and eastward from Lexington Avenue to the East River's western branch (facing Roosevelt Island).Giner, Val. \\"Turtle Bay\\" in , p. 1340Hanlon, Pamela Manhattan's Turtle Bay: Story of a Midtown Neighborhood Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. p. 14; \\"...bounded by Lexington Avenue and the East River from roughly 43rd Street to 53rd Street...\\"\\"Map.\\" Turtle Bay Association. Retrieved on January 25, 2009 The neighborhood is the site of the headquarters of the United Nations and the Chrysler Building. The Tudor City apartment complex is to the south of Turtle Bay. Turtle Bay is named after a former cove of the East River, which in turn was named after the Dutch word for \\"knife\\". The neighborhood was originally settled as a Dutch farm in the 17th century, and was subsequently developed with tenements, power plants, and slaughterhouses in the 19th century. These industrial structures were largely demolished in the 1940s and 1950s to make way for the United Nations headquarters. Today, Turtle Bay contains multiple missions and consulates to the nearby United Nations headquarters. Turtle Bay is part of Manhattan Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10017 and 10022. It is patrolled by the 17th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History =Colonial days= Turtle Bay, a cove of the East River, received its name in the 17th century by its resemblance in shape to that of a knife, being Dutch for \\"knife\\". The cove, which was filled in after the Civil War, was a valuable shelter from the often harsh weather on the river, and became a thriving site for shipbuilding. The Turtle Bay neighborhood was originally a land grant given to two Englishmen by the Dutch colonial governor of New Amsterdam in 1639, and named \\"Turtle Bay Farm\\". The farm extended roughly from what is now 43rd Street to 48th Street, and from Third Avenue to the river. Turtle Bay in 1853 On a knoll overlooking the cove, near 41st Street, the farmhouse was purchased as a summer retreat by Francis Bayard,Dorothy B. Wexler, Reared in a Greenhouse: the stories and story, of Dorothy Winthrop Bradford 1998:39. and in the early 19th century remained the summer villa of Francis Bayard Winthrop.Recollections of John Flavel Mines, in A Tour Around New York, and My Summer Acre, 1893:409. Turtle Creek, or DeVoor's Mill Creek as it was known, emptied into the cove at what is now 47th Street.\\"A scrawny ledge of rock at the foot of Forty-Fifth Street marks the approximate location of Turtle Bay\\" (WPA Guide 1939:209). To the south lay Kip's Bay farm; to the north, on a bluff, stood James Beekman's \\"Mount Pleasant\\", the first of a series of houses and villas with water views stretching away up the shoreline. After the street grid system was initiated in Manhattan, the hilly landscape of the Turtle Bay Farm was graded to create cross-streets and the land was subdivided for residential development. =Late 19th century= An army enrollment office was established at Third Avenue and 46th Street, after the first Draft Act was passed during the American Civil War. On July 13, 1863, an angry mob burned the office to the ground and proceeded to riot through the surrounding neighborhood, destroying entire blocks. The New York Draft Riots continued for three days before army troops managed to contain the mob, which had burned and looted much of the city. After the war ended, the formerly pastoral neighborhood was developed with brownstones. By 1868 the bay had been entirely filled in by commercial overdevelopment, packed with breweries, gasworks, slaughterhouses, cattle pens, coal yards, and railroad piers.Hanlon 2008:19. By the early 20th century, Turtle Bay was \\"a riverside back yard\\" for the city, as the WPA Guide to New York City (1939) described it: \\"huge industrial enterprises‚Äîbreweries, laundries, abattoirs, power plants‚Äîalong the water front face squalid tenements not far away from new apartment dwellings attracted to the section by its river view and its central position. The numerous plants shower this district with the heaviest sootfall in the city‚Äî150 tons to the square mile annually\\".WPA Guide 1939:208. The huge Waterside Station, a power plant operated by the Consolidated Edison Company, producing 367,000 kilowatts of electricity in its coal-fired plant, marked the southern boundary of the neighborhood.WPA Guide to New York City. 1939:209. There were also of slaughterhouses along First Avenue. With an infusion of poor immigrants having had come in the later part of the 19th century, and the opening of the elevated train lines along Second and Third Avenues, the neighborhood went into decay with crumbling tenement buildings. =20th and 21st centuries= Tudor City is at Turtle Bay's southern edge. Many tenements were restored in the 1920s, and a large communal garden was established. Charlotte Hunnewell Sorchan saw promise in the run-down rowhouses of Turtle Bay; in 1918 she purchased eleven houses on the south side of 49th Street and nine on the north side of 48th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues; within two years she had renovated the enclave called Turtle Bay Gardens. Her architects refaced the brownstone street-fronts with pale stucco, and rearranged the interiors so that service rooms faced the noisy street and living areas faced inwards, where the individual back yards were arranged so that each opens into a common garden of trees and shrubs down the center.Christopher Gray, \\"Streetscapes: Turtle Bay Gardens\\" The New York Times, 27 November 1988: accessed September 5, 2010. Having married Walton Martin, she then sold the houses to friends at cost, with property restrictions that kept the commons secure. Among the first purchasers was Maria Bowen Chapin, founder of the Chapin School. Celebrity residents since have included actors Katharine Hepburn, Ruth Gordon, June Havoc, Ricardo Montalban, and Tyrone Power; writer- director Garson Kanin, composer Stephen Sondheim; jurist Learned Hand, conductor Leopold Stokowski; editor Maxwell Perkins; publisher Henry Luce; journalist Dorothy Thompson; and writer/journalist E. B. White, who wrote Charlotte's Web when living on 48th Street.Gray 1988; New York Architectural Images: Turtle Bay It was designated the Turtle Bay Gardens Historic District in 1966. An area between First and Second Avenues, and 41st and 43rd Streets was known as \\"Goat Hill\\"‚Äîgoats and squatters ruled the area‚Äîand later renamed \\"Prospect Hill\\". Prospect Hill developed into a shanty Irish community known as \\"Corcoran's Roost\\", founded by Jimmy Corcoran, in the 1850s, and later became known as a community with a high rate of violent crime and a haven for waterfront thieves such as the Rag Gang, during the late 19th century. From 1927 to 1932, the 2,800-unit Tudor City was built on this site, which was in 1988 named a historic district. The clearing of the slaughterhouses for the construction of the UN headquarters in 1948, largely completed by 1952, and the removal of the elevated trains opened the neighborhood up for high-rise office buildings and condominiums. Concurrent with the UN headquarters' construction, the Ralph Bunche Park staircase was constructed, connecting Tudor City to the rest of Turtle Bay. Until the Third Avenue El was demolished in 1956, it was characterized by a blighted stretch of sooty darkness that had separated the neighborhood from Midtown Manhattan. The United Nations Headquarters is located in Turtle Bay; pictured is the United Nations Secretariat Building. After the UN headquarters' expansion plan was originally announced in 2000, it was opposed by some Turtle Bay residents over concerns about the loss of the current Robert Moses Playground in order to build a long-sought new UN building on the site. In October 2011, city and state officials announced an agreement in which the UN would be allowed to build the tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current playground. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.

The entirety of Community District 6, which comprises Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town, had 53,120 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (45%) are between the ages of 25‚Äì44, while 22% are between 45‚Äì64, and 13% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 7% and 12% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 6 was $112,383, though the median income in Turtle Bay individually was $135,360 In 2018, an estimated 10% of Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City.

The character was first introduced in the 1994 video game The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japanese team from the series' title tournament. Kyo, heir to the Kusanagi clan, is first introduced as a cocky, delinquent high-school student who has pyrokinetic powers. His clan is one of three who banished the legendary snake entity Yamata no Orochi. During the series' story, Kyo meets rivals and enemies who seek to take his flame abilities. Aside from the main series, Kyo appears in several crossovers and spinoffs with other games. He is also the central title character of the manga The King of Fighters: Kyo and video game adaptation with the same name which center around his daily life. Kyo was created by Shinichi Morioka as a hero who would fight the main characters from other franchises from other SNK franchises, such as Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. His debut in The King of Fighters received a large positive response by fans, making Kyo return in The King of Fighters '99 where he was originally non available in early versions. His outfit and gameplay techniques were redesigned throughout the series; since his original appearance, featuring a high-school uniform, became popular with fans, designers created clones of his original costume in later games. The same occurred with his moves, which have been re-balanced across the series. Video game journalists have praised Kyo's design and fighting style as among the best of the series, and in fighting games in general. His role in the story and his long rivalry with Iori Yagami were also celebrated. The character's redesign in The King of Fighters XIV earned mixed responses because of the differences to previous incarnations. Kyo's role in printed media and other adaptations of the series has often been criticized, most notably in the live-action film. A variety of Kyo collectibles, including key chains and figurines, has been created. Conception and creation =Origin and influences= Early sketches of Kyo when he was known as Syo Kirishima Kyo Kusanagi was created by artist Shinichi Morioka. When designing characters for the first King of Fighters game, developers wanted a new, \\"snazzy\\" hero who would fight against characters from two other SNK series, Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. Through most of his development, Kyo was named and was dressed in martial arts clothing common in fighting games of the time. His design was inspired by the main character of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga and film Akira, Shotaro Kaneda. Late in production, his name was changed to Kyo Kusanagi, as a means of relating the character to the Yamata no Orochi legend, which was the basis of the story arc of the game. The name Syo would later be used for Kyo's Another Striker in The King of Fighters 2000. Another planned name before Syo was but no design was elaborated from it. However, in the end SNK chose the name Kyo as they felt it more fitting. While in charge of designing the character, Yuichiro Hiraki sought to contrast Kyo with Street Fighter character Ryu, as he believed the latter was a popular character in international markets and that Kyo's characterization and design could benefit from appealing to as broad a demographic as possible. Despite Kyo originally being depicted as a lazy young adult, he shows a notable character arc across the games: he develops a new fighting style on his own which contrasts his original concept of being born with talent. When making The King of Fighters '94, developers thought Kyo would appeal to audiences by contrasting starkly with characters from Fatal Fury, whose characters were much older and had more muscular bodies than Kyo's. Kyo's girlfriend Yuki was also created by Morioka. By the next game, SNK introduced Iori Yagami as Kyo's rival; in contrast to Kyo, SNK decided to keep Iori's life as private as possible in order to differentiate the two characters. The game's developers decided Kyo's main abilities would be fire-based, alongside the movesets of the other characters in the original Japan Team, who were all inspired by the manga and anime Getter Robo, created by Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa. The three members of the Japan Team, Benimaru Nikaido, Goro Daimon and Kyo, had personalities similar to those of the main characters from Getter Robo. Kyo was based on the main character, Ryoma Nagare, who had a fiery persona. The elements and the personalities were also a homage to a Japanese phrase about giving birth to fire: \\"lightning strikes the earth which sparks the flame\\". According to Morioka, Ikki Kajiwara's Ashita no Joe and Nagai's Devilman manga series were influences too. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Artist Nona said he found it difficult to design Kyo as a heroic character due to his dark traits, noting the character was also inspired by Akira Fudo, the protagonist of Devilman. Kyo's pixel art was created by Hiraki, who despite leaving SNK to work on another project a few years later, was asked by Capcom's Kaname Fujioka to once again work on Kyo's design for the crossover game Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000. Artist Falcoon states that Kyo has a strong attitude, making him one of the hardest characters to illustrate, while also noting that his rivalry with Iori Yagami is strong enough to make the duo likable. =Designs and actors= Kyo's appearance has changed starting with the NESTS story arc while reflecting a change in his persona During the early stages of development for The King of Fighters '99, SNK planned to exclude Kyo and Iori from the game because its story was centered on new protagonist K', but they reversed this decision because \\"they couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo\\". Kyo's repeated appearances in every game in the series, at the insistence of SNK executives for marketing purposes, made story planning for each title challenging, with artist Hiroaki Hashimoto expressing a desire for his work to live up to Shinkiro's, which he said left a great impression on him. Several of the series' designers said Kyo is one of the most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity. Although Kyo was redesigned for KOF '99, some designers wanted to return to his iconic school uniform. Near the end of production, staff could not decide which uniform the Kyo clone should wear, so the project head decided to make two clones. To save time, the project head drew designs for Kyo-1 and Kyo-2 on the character roster. The same situation occurred during production of The King of Fighters 2002; the designers created another clone of Kyo called \\"Kusanagi\\" to include his school uniform design. The developers of the series for The King of Fighters 2001, Eolith, noted that Kyo and Iori were also popular in their country, which led to their immediate inclusion in their game. Falcoon redesigned Kyo's clothes for the spin-off game KOF: Maximum Impact 2; his jacket was redesigned while keeping the appeal of the original costume. His \\"Normal Color F\\" attire is similar to his father's martial arts clothing. The outfit called \\"Color G\\" is reminiscent of the costume design of Yuki, the popular protagonist of NeoGeo Battle Coliseum. While Kyo often wears different outfits for each game's story mode, he was given a more masculine appearance for The King of Fighters XIII. Artist Ogura expressed pressure when designing this incarnation of the character, saying it had to live up to an enduring reputation. With designers believing he had become a more traditional fighter, they gave him a simpler, more modern appearance for The King of Fighters XIV. Character designer Nobuyuki Kuroki said staff wanted to captivate new fans with Kyo's larger design regardless of negative backlash. Producer Yasuyuki Oda noted that while researching new characters for KOF XIV, Kyo's moves avoided stereotypes like Japanese sumo wrestlers to produce more variety within the cast, which included characters of multiple nationalities. Oda added that they \\"Kyo-ify\\" the new members to produce originality in the game. Yuichi Nakamura portrayed Kyo in a commercial promoting the cellphone game The King of Fighters All Stars, alongside Hiroshi Fujioka. In the live-action film, Kyo was portrayed by Sean Faris. Kyo's Japanese voice actor Masahiro Nonaka related with his character as being young and reckless until he \\"grew up\\" in his later appearances. He then expressed some difficulty accepting Kyo on the same level. Tomoaki Maeno replaced Nonaka for The King of Fighters XIV and said he was putting all his efforts and expected the fandom to enjoy his work as the new voice of Kyo. Maeno noted the impact of Kyo was challenging as he was the main character from a famous series of fighting games. He often often played the demo of The King of Fighters XIV as Kyo in order to fully appreciate the character. For The King of Fighters for Girls, Maeno was careful with his performance as he understands due to how beloved is his character. He was careful in his songs and took a liking to the catchphrase \\"Moetaro?\\" (Got burned?). =Fighting style= In his debut, Kyo fights with the , attacking opponents using flames and several hits from his limbs. This was developed by Mitsuo Kodama, an animator in charge of the first game in the series. In later series' tournaments, he combines fire with a personal style of kenp≈ç. His fighting style was changed as part of the series' overhaul in The King of Fighters '96. To appease fans, producers also included an older version of Kyo from KOF '94 into The King of Fighters '97 and placed The King of Fighters '95 version of Kyo in The King of Fighters '98, which increased the character's popularity during location tests. In KOF '96 he was given a new move known as the , which Yasuyuki Oda said is one of his favorites because it reminded him of mecha series from the 1990s. Oda also noted that Kyo was one of his favorite characters in the series as found his moves easy to learn. Kyo's gameplay was modified again for The King of Fighters '99 onwards, with most of his original moves being left for his clones. Although Kyo retains his third outfit in The King of Fighters XII, his moves were modified to those from the first two games of the series to make the character fight in close quarters rather than using projectiles, improving the balance of the roster, and making fights more entertaining. Kyo's signature technique is the , a massive slash of fire he creates with one hand. The staff worked to incorporate this move into the game carefully, trying to make it as realistic as possible while using enhanced special effects. This was given a mid-air variation for The King of Fighters XIII; designers kept in mind the concept of coolness and the small difficulty in performing it. Kyo's Neo Max technique, the \\"\\", in which he covers the enemies with walls of fire, was the first move of this category to be made for the game. As a result, the other characters' Neo Max techniques were reformatted so as to be comparable with Kyo's move. \\"NESTS Kyo\\" was added to the game as downloadable content; this version focused on his hand-to-hand combat, contrasting from his original moves in XIII. SNK worked to balance this version of the character to the original, ensuring neither version would be superior to the other. Like Kyo, his regular desperation move involves the original Orochinagi, but he retains the , a move where he consecutively punches the enemy while adding increasing flame damage to each strike. His Neo Max is a new technique named which covers the entire screen in flames. For The King of Fighters XIV, Oda wanted to keep his gameplay intact in order to avoid fan backlash. Kyo's strongest move is both a reference to his father's technique as well as the Kusanagi myths from his origins. Appearances =In video games= In the main King of Fighters video games Kyo is one of the last members of the Kusanagi clan who can create fire; 660 years before the games' events, the Kusanagi and Yasakani clans were allies but the latter's jealousy over the former's fame led the Yasakani to make a pact with the demon Orochi. Since then, the clans have had a generation-long grudge with casualties on both sides. Kyo's rivalry with Iori Yagami is one of mutual hatred rather than history. In the first The King of Fighters video game, Kyo stars in the famous fighting tournament as the leader of the Japan Team with Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. They become champions and defeat the host Rugal Bernstein. In the next title, the Japan Team again faces Rugal and Kyo's brainwashed father Saisyu. While Rugal dies, Saisyu is saved from Rugal's control. Prior to the events of The King of Fighters '96, the a man named Goenitz ‚Äì a follower of Orochi ‚Äì easily defeats Kyo, causing him to seek revenge. The tournament's host, Chizuru Kagura, wants Kyo and Iori Yagami on her team to help defeat Orochi and stop Goenitz. In The King of Fighters '97, Kyo faces Orochi's remaining followers, the New Faces Team, who aim to revive Orochi by sacrificing Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki. Following their failure, Orochi possess one of them, Chris, but Kyo and Iori manage to defeat him, leaving him to be sealed by Chizuru. In KOF '98, Kyo appears as a playable character on the Japan Team with Benimaru and Daimon. An alternative version of his character, with movesets used in previous games, is also playable. Kyo is a secret character in most versions of The King of Fighters '99, and has no team. Kyo is kidnapped by the NESTS syndicate, who use his DNA to make clones of him. Kyo enters his captors' base and tries to obtain answers from them, but is forced to retreat when the base begins to collapse. If the player has accrued enough points, Kyo can be faced in a bonus fight. He continues his fight against the NESTS alone in The King of Fighters 2000 but in the next game, Kyo reunites with his old teammates, and his student Shingo Yabuki, to make a comeback on the Japan Team. In KOF 2002, Kyo is a playable character on the original Japan Team. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appears to Kyo and Iori, asking them to form a team to investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get their clans' powers and steal them from Chizuru. In The King of Fighters XI, Kyo and Iori again form a team with Shingo, filling Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. The growing presence of Orochi, however, causes Iori to go berserk and harm his teammates. Ash then appears, defeats Iori, and steals his abilities. The PlayStation 2 port added an alternative version of Kyo that has his NESTS saga moves. In King of Fighters XII, Kyo is a playable character but he does not have a team. Kyo reunites with the original members of the Esaka Team in The King of Fighters XIII. Following Ash's disappearance causing Iori to recover his powers, Kyo fights his rival again. Additionally, an alternative version of himself, with different moves called \\"NESTS Style Kyo\\", is available as downloadable content. Kyo returns in The King of Fighters XIV with his old comrades, where his classic school costume appears as downloadable content through pre-order bonus released in the online store. Kyo enters the tournament at the request of his father to meet Tung Fu Rue's students. After an unknown being stops the competition, Kyo reunites with Iori and Chizuru to reseal a weak Orochi, who had been previously revived. In other games Kyo appears in a role-playing video game titled The King of Fighters: Kyo, in which he travels around the world to prepare for The King of Fighters tournament until the events of KOF '97. In this game, Kyo's actor Masahiro Nonaka performs a song named \\"Pieces\\" during a karaoke fight between he and Iori. This song was included in the CD Drama NEOÔΩ•GEO DJ Station. Kyo receives a letter for the KOF '97 tournament and has a month to travel across the world to form his team. Chizuru Kagura tests Kyo's will to fight by creating a scenario in which Kyo's girlfriend Yuki is kidnapped. Kyo appears in the spin-off video games The King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise as a member of a band. The King of Fighters R-1 again reprises the events of KOF '97; in this game Kyo also teams up with Shingo and Kim Kaphwan in an alternate scenario.

He is present in the spin-offs Neowave and the Maximum Impact series. In Maximum Impact 2, Kyo is playable as his classic version from the first games as well as with a new outfit. In each North American edition following Maximum Impact, Kyo is voiced by Andrew Roth, an English voice actor. During The King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood, Moe Habana, the heir of one of the ten sacred treasures, finds Kyo seriously wounded after his fight against Orochi. After healing him, Moe joins Kyo and Benimaru to participate in a tournament developed by the criminal Geese Howard, who is searching for the power of Orochi. In the sequel game The King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood, Reiji Okami, another member of the ten sacred treasures, asks Kyo to join him as his teammate in a new tournament so they can investigate interference with the Orochi seal. He is present in the Chinese mobile phone games named KOF: WORLD, and KOF X Arena Masters. In the role-playing game The King of Fighters All Star Kyo is present in his original look as well as his NESTS persona.

Enraged by the cartel, Kyo kills the recently reborn NESTS leader, Igniz, and destroys their base. Afterwards, Kyo reunites with his allies and the Yagami Team to face the wraith brought by a creature referred to as a Verse. In The King of Fighters movie, Kyo is played by Sean Faris and is portrayed as Japanese-American. During the story, Kyo joins forces with Iori and Mai Shiranui to defeat Rugal. In the CGI web series The King of Fighters: Destiny, Kyo goes to his first team tournament with Benimaru and Daimon. While he is first interested in fighting Terry Bogard, he becomes concerned when he senses the power of the Orochi within the fighters and seeks to stop the mastermind behind this. The web series has an extra episode that shows Kyo befriending Benimaru during a fight against multiple yakuza. After saving the tournament's fighters from Orochi's power, which causes them to go berserk, Kyo, Terry and Heidern meet Rugal, the person using them, and fight him. With help from his partners, Kyo defeats his enemy. He also appears in the trailer of the upcoming film The King of Fighters: Awaken challenging Goenitz. Cultural impact =Critical response= Kyo Kusanagi received major praise ever since his introduction. In a retrospective review of the series' debut, VideoGamer.com called Kyo one of the most popular video game characters from Japan during his 1994 debut. Similarly, although the first King of Fighters game promoted the possibility of fights between Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting characters, Nintendo Life and Hobby Consolas regarded Kyo as the most popular character from the game, calling him the \\"best star\\" in the franchise. The sites also named him and Iori as among the best characters in the series. Damien McFerran of Virtual Console Reviews considered Kyo one of the best creations from The King of Fighters series, as well as the most original one. On the other hand, Den of Geek noted that while Kyo was introduced as a weak main character, as a result of the pressure of the series also using Terry Bogard and Ryo Sakazaki‚Äîheroes from other SNK's series‚Äîby the climax of the Orochi arc he becomes more appealing due to his role in this part and his new movesets. Critics also liked the rivalry between Kyo and Iori. The Daily Star noted that although Kyo and Iori begin as enemies, they become allies in later games, leading to their popularity. When joining with Chizuru Kagura and most notably Iori, the formation of the new Sacred Treasure Team in KOF '96 and KOF '97 for serving as a proper conclusion to the Orochi story arc during these two games. Folowing the Orochi arc, in The King of Fighters '99, Kyo was originally a hidden character. He became instantly playable in the console ports, which led to praise within fans and writers. While there were not changes to the character in the next game, Hardcore Gaming recognized his new theme song, \\"Goodbye Esaka\\", as one of ones ever produced in the series. Kyo received mixed reactions when The King of Fighters XIV was first revealed. 3DJuegos, Meristation and PushSquare said Kyo was off-modeled because the game engine distanced him from previous King of Fighters incarnations. On the other hand, Juan Garcia from IGN liked both the redesigns of Kyo and Robert Garcia. When the game was patched to improve the graphics, Siliconera said Kyo's appearance was highly improved. GamesRadar said the look of Kyo in the game is faithful to his previous incarnations. The addition of a unique theme song for Kyo's and Iori's rival fight in XIV was also praised. Anime News Network expressed disappointment that Kyo was not picked as a SNK representative character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as he had few guest appearances in comparison to Terry Bogard. Some critics commented on the character's moves. IGN writer A.E. Sparrow wrote that Kyo is one of the most enjoyable characters to play in the King of Fighters series, praising the dynamism of his moveset and fighting style. In another review, Sparrow considered him to be one of the most useful characters in the games and one of the best for veteran players. Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely praised Kyo's redesign in The King of Fighters '99, saying he felt less overpowered than in previous games, which helped to balance the cast, but still felt him weaker in comparison to the new character Terry Bogard. Electronic Gaming Monthly shared similar comments, stating he became a fan of Kyo thanks to his NESTS moves, which made his downloadable version from KOF XIII exciting, and Shoryuken said this version was more interesting than the regular Kyo. GameSpot has criticized the addition of the Kyo clones in this game, writing that they do not add new elements because they share most of the moves of the original Kyo. Prima Games listed his \\"Orochinagi\\" as the 40th best technique in gaming due to the way it covers the screen. Complex ranked Kyo as the 11th Most Dominant Fighting Game Character, praising his special moves. Brandon Orselli from Niche Gamer found the character \\"great\\" in XIV because his moves would appeal to both newcomers and veterans of the franchise. A Gamasutra writer enjoyed Kyo's mechanics in the Capcom vs. SNK series due to his uniqueness while being confronted by other characters. He said he found the Street Fighter IV character El Fuerte similar to Kyo because they are different from the \\"shotokan\\" characters from that franchise, such as Ryu and Ken Masters. Similarly, both PlayStation Blog and Polygon suggested that newcomers of The King of Fighters XIV try Kyo first; Polygon said he has similarities with the Street Fighters characters, which are also recommended for beginners. Meristation was bothered by Kyo's simple moves in The King of Fighters XII and XIII, and was pleased with the return of hand-to-hand techniques in XIV. Outside the video games, Kyo has made appearances that met with disapproval by critics. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN lamented that Kyo has few appearances in the volume from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 in comparison to Ash Crimson, who is the greater focus of the series. Den of Geek found the comic SVC Chaos ridiculous because when Kyo is killed by Akuma and Takuma Sakazaki in the first chapter, Iori in turn kills himself to go to the afterlife and kill Kyo there, which causes M. Bison to also kill himself to search for Iori. John Funk from The Escapist found the trailer for the series' live-action film confusing because Kyo's race was changed from Japanese to white. Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film because of flashbacks to his childhood depicting him as Japanese whereas his adult self is American. Stuff also had a harsh opinion of Kyo being played by Sean Faris despite the character's Asian origins. Kyo's portrayal in The King of Fighters: Destiny received more favorable responses because the plot does not solely focus on his history, but also other characters from the games. Anime UK News enjoyed Kyo's handling in the manga A New Beginning due to how his rivalry stands out in the first fight more than the new protagonist, Shun'ei. =Popularity= Kyo has been well-received by gamers; he has appeared in several popularity polls. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second-favorite character behind Iori. In a 2005 poll by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted the sixth fan-favorite character with 176 votes, which led to him having less inclusion on the cover of Maximum Impact in the North American release. Additionally, in the January 30, 1995, issue of Gamest magazine in Japan, Kyo was featured at No. 4 in the Top 50 Characters of 1994. In the character-popularity poll on the website of Neo Geo Freak magazine, he was voted the third-favorite character with 2,574 votes. In another poll from 1997, Kyo took first place with 2,160 votes. At a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration listed Kyo as the mascot of the mid-1990s era of Neo Geo. For the special endings in The King of Fighters '97, the video game journals Gamest, Famitsu and Neo Geo Freak created a team composed of three characters from the game so they would be featured in an image after passing the arcade mode. Neo Geo Freaks team was Kyo, Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane. The special ending only appears in Japanese versions of the game. In an ASCII Media Works poll, in which fans voted on video game or manga characters they would like to name their children after, Kyo's name was tenth in the male category. In the book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific, Kyo was named as one of the most popular video game characters in Hong Kong from the mid 1990s onwards, alongside Iori and Mai. In 2018, Kyo was voted the fifth-most-popular Neo Geo character. In 2008, Insert Credit, a publisher related to game piracy, created an 8-bit fighting game titled Top Fighter, in which Kyo was one of the characters. Merchandising based on Kyo's appearance has also been released. Yutaka issued an articulated action figure and a puzzle of Kyo from KoF '97. With the release of new video games in the series, SNK developed new action figures and key-chains. To choose the covers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports of KOF XII, Ignition Entertainment started a survey on May 4, 2009, in which users of its forum could vote for one of two covers, one of which features Kyo and the other Iori. When the two surveys ended, Ignition started two new ones to select between the previous winners and the Japanese covers from the game for both consoles. SNK artist Falcoon said he believes Kyo appealed to gamers in the 1990s because of his appearance and fashion style. For the release of The King of Fighters XIV, SNK created a theme featuring Kyo and Iori, and a special \\"Day One Edition\\" with a SteelBook finish and an image of Kyo Kusanagi on the cover. Two figurines based on Kyo's original form and his XIV look have been released, including a Nendoroid figure based on the former. The latter attracted Kuroki's attention. Kyo's image was used in late 2018 as part of collaborations between SNK and other companies.

Opened as a replacement for the Carolina Coliseum with the name Carolina Center in 2002, the 18,000-seat arena is also host to various events like conferences, concerts, and graduation ceremonies throughout the year. It is the largest arena in the state of South Carolina and the eighth largest campus college arena. The naming rights were acquired in 2003 by Unum, a Portland, Maine‚Äìbased insurance company, and it was renamed to the Colonial Center after the Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, a Unum subsidiary headquartered in Columbia. On July 22, 2008, the USC board approved renaming the building to the Colonial Life Arena as part of the rebranding by Unum (which by then had moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee) of Colonial Life & Accident as Colonial Life. History and use The arena floor of the Colonial Life Arena. The arena first opened on November 22, 2002, with the season opener of the South Carolina women's basketball team. A near sell-out crowd of 17,712 fans saw the 72-58 Gamecocks victory over in-state rival Clemson, with a $1 admission charge, at that time commonly used by the women's basketball team to promote major games. The official grand opening took place December 2, 2002. The men's basketball team defeated Temple 66-47\\\\. On January 26, 2010 South Carolina defeated #1 ranked and undefeated Kentucky 68‚Äì62 in the arena, one of the biggest wins in South Carolina history. Aside from Gamecock basketball, the Colonial Life Arena also hosts the South Carolina High School Basketball Championships each year. The facility is built to also host ice hockey games, and was intended to be the new home of the ECHL's Columbia Inferno. However, due to legal issues with the funding for the facility, the Inferno never played there. The franchise suspended operations in 2008, but after plans for a new arena in neighboring Lexington County fell through, the franchise was finally canceled in 2014. The Colonial Life Arena was ranked 22nd in the world in ticket sales in 2003. It was also ranked the #1 arena in the Carolinas and was the #2 rated university arena in the world in 2005, based on ticket sales for touring shows.http://sdm3.com/viewmsg.cfm?n35069s338c632468t337e1685912 It is managed by Spectra (formerly Global Spectrum), the facilities management subsidiary of Comcast Spectacor. The NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, then owned by Comcast Spectacor, played an exhibition game in the venue in October 2005. In 2007, it was home to the Columbia Stingers of the National Indoor Football League. The arena has hosted the Charlotte Bobcats and New York Knicks in the past. The venue, like all Comcast-Spectator managed facilities, has its own ticketing policy, and therefore concerts are not controlled by the major ticketing industry firms. Ticketing is provided by New Era Tickets, and tickets can be purchased through the Arena's web site. Non-basketball events Other events held at the Arena have included Disney on Ice, High School Musical: The Concert, Sesame Street, American Idols Live!, Trans-Siberian Orchestra every December since 2005, Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus (until 2017), ventriloquist Jeff Dunham, and WWE Raw. =Concerts= Artists that have performed at the arena over the past 17 years include: The Eagles, Cher, Billy Joel, Elton John (in '05, 2019, and 2020).

Both streams descend over a series of dramatic cascades just prior to the confluence, which occurs at the base of a table land which they surround on three sides. The perimeter of this table land is surrounded by a low stone wall generally in height.

They also live in the Ethiopian region Gambella , They speak the Nuer language, which belongs to the Nilotic language family. They are the second largest ethnic group in south Sudan . The Nuer people are pastoralists who herd cattle for a living. Their cattle serve as companions and define their lifestyle. The Nuer call themselves \\"Naath\\". Overview In South Sudan, the Nuer are primarily located in the northeast of the country The Nuer people have historically been undercounted because of the semi- nomadic lifestyle. They also have a culture of counting only older members of the family. For example, the Nuer believe that counting the number of children one has could result in misfortune and prefer to report fewer children than they have. Their Ethiopian counterparts are the Horn peninsula's westernmost Horners.Johnson, Douglas H. \\"On the Nilotic frontier: imperial Ethiopia in the southern Sudan, 1898-1936.\\" (1986): 219-245. History The Nuer people are said to have originally been a section of the Dinka people that migrated out of the Gezira but south into a barren dry land that they called \\"Kwer Kwong\\"\\", which was in southern Kordofan. Centuries of isolation and influence from Luo peoples caused them to be a distinct ethnic group from the Dinka. The Arrival of Bagarra Arabs and their subsequent slave raids in the late 1700s caused the Nuer to migrate en masse from southern Kordofan into what is now Bentiu. In around 1850, further slave raids as well as flooding and overpopulation caused them to migrate even further out of Bentiu and eastwards all the way into the western fringes of Ethiopia, displacing and absorbing many Dinka, Anyuak and Burun in the process. The intrusion of the British in the 19th century greatly halted the Nuers aggressive territorial expansion against the Dinka and Anyuak. There are different accounts of the origin of the conflict between the Nuer and the Dinka, South Sudan's two largest ethnic groups. Anthropologist Peter J. Newcomer suggests that the Nuer are actually Dinka. He argues that hundreds of years of population growth created expansion, which eventually led to raids and wars. In 2006 the Nuer were the tribe that resisted disarmament most strongly; members of the Nuer White Army, a group of armed youths often autonomous from tribal elders' authority, refused to lay down their weapons, which led SPLA soldiers to confiscate Nuer cattle, destroying their economy. The White Army was finally put down in mid-2006, though a successor organisation self-styling itself as a White Army formed in 2011 to fight the Murle tribe (see 2011‚Äì2012 South Sudan tribal clashes), as well as the Dinka and UNMISS. Culture Cattle have historically been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value to the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson writes that \\"among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle was continually underplayed.\\" Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. This exchange of cattle ensures that the children will be considered to belong to the husband's lineage. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can \\"father\\" children after his death, is based on this definition of relations of kinship and descent by cattle exchange. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. An infertile woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children, biologically fathered by men from other unions, then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to metaphorically participate in reproduction. = Cattle = Nuer life revolves around cattle, which has made them pastoralist, but they are known to sometimes resort to horticulture as well, especially when their cattle are threatened by disease. Due to seasonal harsh weather, the Nuer move around to ensure that their livelihood is safe. They tend to travel when heavy seasons of rainfall come to protect the cattle from hoof disease, and when resources for the cattle are scarce. British anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard wrote, ‚ÄúThey depend on the herds for their very existence...Cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer institutions, language, rites of passage, politics, economy, and allegiances.‚Äú The Nuer are able to structure their entire culture around cattle and still have what they need. Before development the Nuer used every single piece of cattle to their advantage. According to Evans-Pritchard, cattle helped evolve the Nuer culture into what it is today. They shaped the Nuer's daily duties, as they dedicate themselves to protecting the cattle. For example, each month they blow air into their cattle's rectums to relieve or prevent constipation. Cattle are no good to the Nuer if constipated because they are restricted from producing primary resources that families need to survive. Evans-Pritchard wrote, \\"The importance of cattle in Nuer life and thought is further exemplified in personal names.\\" They form their children's names from biological features of the cattle. Evans-Pritchard wrote, \\"I have already indicated that this obsession‚Äîfor such it seems to an outsider is due not only to the great economic value of cattle but also to the fact that they are links in numerous social relationships.\\" All their raw materials come from cattle, including for drums, rugs, clothing, spears, shields, containers, and leather goods. Even daily essentials like toothpaste and mouthwash are created from the cattle's dung and urine. The dung is chopped into pieces and left out to harden, then used for containers, toothpaste, or even to protect the cattle themselves by burning it to produce more smoke, keeping insects away to prevent disease. The Nuer people never eat cattle just because they want to. Cattle are very sacred to them, therefore when they do eat cattle they honor its ghost. They typically just eat the cattle that is up in age or dying because of sickness. But even if they do so, they all gather together performing rituals, dances or songs before and after they slaughter the cattle. Never do they just kill cattle for the fun of it. ‚ÄúNever do Nuer slaughter animals solely because the desire to eat meat. There is the danger of the ox‚Äôs spirit visiting a curse on any individual who would slaughter it without ritual intent, aiming only to use it for food. Any animal that dies of natural causes is eaten.‚Äù Many times it may not even just be cattle that they consume, it could be any animal they have scavenged upon that has died because of natural causes. There are a few other food sources that are available for the Nuer to consume. The Nuer diet primarily consists of fish and millet. ‚ÄúTheir staple crop is millet.\\" Millet is formally consumed as porridge or beer. The Nuer turn to this staple product in seasons of rainfall when they move their cattle up to higher ground. They might also turn to millet when the cattle are performing well enough to support their family. = Kinship = To a Nuer individual, his parents and siblings are not considered mar (blood relatives) kin. He doesn't refer to them as kin. To him they are considered gol which is far more intimate and significant. There are kinship categories in the Nuer society. Those categories depend on the payment to them. There is a balance between the mother and father's side that is acknowledged through particular formal occasions such as marriage. Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a young girl gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are essentially delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she is able to freely choose her husband, however her parents may choose a spouse for her.  Kinship roles  Kinship among the Nuer is very important to them, they refer to their blood relatives as \`\`gol‚Äù. Kinship within the Nuer is formed off of one's neighbors or their entire culture. During E.E.Evans-Pritchard's ethnographic observation, he described the role of kinship as: ‚ÄúKinship obligations include caring for the children of one‚Äôs kin and neighbors. He also observed that,\\"The network of kinship ties which links members of local communities is brought about by the operation of exogamous rules, often stated in terms of cattle.\\" This is never thought to be the sole responsibility of the child's parents.\\" Cattle are judged by how much milk they can produce which is a necessity in their culture. If possible they create the excess of milk into cheese. But if a family‚Äôs herd cannot produce the amount of milk a family needs then they turn to others around them to give them what they need. It‚Äôs seen as their responsibility to step in and help the family since it‚Äôs not really their fault on how much their cattle can produce. The entire Nuer society is basically watching after each other, for example, as Evans-Pritchard noted that,‚ÄúWhen one household has a surplus, it is shared with neighbors. Amassing wealth is not an aim. Although a man who owns a large herd of cattle may be envied, his possession of numerous animals does not garner him any special privilege or treatment.‚Äù In this tribe there is no special treatment for how one is treated because of their abundance in cattle. Just because one might have more cattle than another doesn't mean they have a higher prestige. If one might have more than enough to provide for themselves then they also provide that to other kin that are in need, as it is a part of their role in kinship. = Religion = E. E. Evans-Pritchard studied the Nuer and made very detailed accounts of his interactions. He also describes Nuer cosmology and religion in his books. Nuer Online indicates that, \\"Nuer (Nu√§√§r) believes that God is the spirit of the sky or the spirit who is in the sky‚Äù Kuoth Nhial‚Äù (God in Heaven) the creator, but Nuers believe in the coming of God through rain, lightning and thunder, and that the rainbow is the necklace of God. The sun and the moon as well as other material entities are also manifestation or sign of God, who after all is a spirit. The spirits of the air above are believed to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when a man or a woman dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.\\". In the 1940s, missionaries began to attempt to evangelize the Nuer. The book of Genesis was translated and published in 1954, with the whole New Testament following in 1968. By the 1970s, there were nearly 200 Nuer congregations established. However, reporting indicates that only around 1% of Nuer identify as Christian. = Role of Cattle = In the 1990s, Sharon Hutchinson returned to Nuerland to update E.E. Evans-Pritchard's account. She found that the Nuer had placed strict limits on the convertibility of money and cattle in order to preserve the special status of cattle as objects of bride wealth exchange and as mediators to the divine. She also found that as a result of endemic warfare with the Sudanese state, guns had acquired much of the symbolic and ritual importance previously held by cattle. = Language = The people speak the Nuer language / Thoknath which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language phylum. = Ritual = The Nuer receive facial markings (called gaar) as part of their initiation into adulthood. The pattern of Nuer scarification varies within specific subgroups. The most common initiation pattern among males consists of six parallel horizontal lines which are cut across the forehead with a razor, often with a dip in the lines above the nose. Dotted patterns are also common (especially among the Bul Nuer and among females). Some Nuer have begun practicing circumcision after being assimilated or partially assimilated in other ethnic groups. The Nuer are not historically known to circumcise, but sometimes circumcise people who have engaged in incest. Typical foods eaten by the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow's milk, mangos, and sorghum in one of three forms: \\"koÃ±p\\" finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, \\"walwal\\" ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and injera / Y…îty…ît, a large, pancake-like yeast-risen flatbread. In the early 1990s about 25,000 African refugees were resettled in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota. In particular, 4,288 refugees from Sudan were resettled among 36 different states between 1990 and 1997 with the highest number in Texas at 17 percent of the refugee population from Sudan. The Nuer refugees in the United States and those in Africa continue to observe their social obligations to one another. They use different means ranging from letters to new technologically advanced communication methods in order to stay connected to their families in Africa. Nuer in the United States provide assistance for family members‚Äô paperwork to help their migration process to the United States. Furthermore, Nuer in the United States observe family obligations by sending money for those still in Africa.  Nuer military and political leaders  Some important Nuer politicians are Both Diu was the first Nuer and South Sudan Politician from 1947 and follow by Gai Tut in Military is Bol Nyawan who fought against the Khartoum government in Bentiu; he was killed in 1985 by the current president of Sudan. Commander Ruai and Liah Diu Deng were responsible for the attack that forced Chevron to suspend activities in the oil field around 1982. Naming conventions * (Nya) Nyada meaning \\"daughter all females begin with (Nya) of\\", is the standard prefix used for female names. Gat, meaning \\"son of\\", is a common prefix for male names. * Children are commonly given names to mark historical events (\\"D…îmaac\\" meaning \\"bullet\\", or Mac meaning \\"fire or gun\\" given to a child born during times of war or from another man in the name of the deceased father who legally married the mother ). * Nhial means \\"sky‚Äù, and is a common name for males and females. *Many Nuer have been exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father's given name follows the child's given name, which is then followed by the grandfather's name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves. *When a Nuer comes to the Western world, which wants a first and last name, it is their custom to give their name as their first name followed by their father's name as their middle name and their grandfather's name as their last name. * After the civil war, the Nuer began accepting cash currency into their economy, changing the dynamics of their cattle and how they were viewed. Each type of cattle is titled according to how they are acquired such as: \\"the cattle of money\\" (purchased with cash currency) and \\"the cattle of girls/daughters\\" (bridewealth). Most Nuer people are named after their cattle. The boys usually chose the name of their favorite cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after the cows that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down. Impact of Oil Economy on Nuer Oil exploration and drilling began in 1975 and 1976 by companies such as Chevron. In 1979 the first oil production took place in the southern regions of Darfur. In the early 1980s when the North-South war was happening, Chevron was interested in the reserves in the south. In 1984 guerrillas of SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) attacked the drilling site of the north at Bentiu. In return, Chevron cleared Nuer and Dinka people in the oil fields area to ensure security for their operations. The Nuer-Dinka struggle in oil fields continued in late 1990s into the early 2000s. The struggle for oil production was not only manifested in North-South fight, but also in Nuer- Dinka and many internal conflicts among Nuer. As part of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), 50 percent of net revenues of southern oil fields were given to the government of southern Sudan as a solution to one of the sources of decades of civil conflict.

Pest control is the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy. In agriculture, pests are kept at bay by cultural, chemical and biological means. Ploughing and cultivation of the soil before sowing mitigate the pest burden and there is a modern trend to limit the use of pesticides as far as possible. This can be achieved by monitoring the crop, only applying insecticides when necessary, and by growing varieties and crops which are resistant to pests. Where possible, biological means are used, encouraging the natural enemies of the pests and introducing suitable predators or parasites. In homes and urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is attempted through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control can be used including sterilisation programmes. History Bronze cat, Ancient Egypt. (664‚Äì525 BC) Pest control is at least as old as agriculture, as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents.Taylor, D., The Complete Contented Cat: Your Ultimate Guide to Feline Fulfilment, David & Charles, 2011, p.9. Archived from the OriginalBeadle, M., Cat, Simon and Schuster, 1979, pp. 93‚Äì96. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were introduced into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.Sherman, D.M., Tending Animals in the Global Village: A Guide to International Veterinary Medicine, John Wiley & Sons, 2007, p. 45. The conventional approach was probably the first to be employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history. Red weaver ants, here feeding on a snail, have been used to control pests in China, Southeast Asia, and Africa for many centuries. Chemical pesticides were first used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was stimulated by the spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This led the way to a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development. Biological control is first recorded around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. which cites Also in China, ducks were used in paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although a renewed interest in traditional and biological pest control developed towards the end of the 20th century and continues to this day. In agriculture, horticulture, and forestry =Control methods= Biological pest control Biological pest control: parasitoid wasp (Cotesia congregata) adult with pupal cocoons on its host, a tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (green background) Biological pest control is a method of controlling pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur in a particular area by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme. For example: mosquitoes are often controlled by putting Bt Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. israelensis, a bacterium that infects and kills mosquito larvae, in local water sources. Cultural control Cultivation by ploughing exposes insect pests to predators such as black-headed gulls. Mechanical pest control is the use of hands-on techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage and is one of the oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them. Crop rotation can help to control pests by depriving them of their host plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced early season incidence of Colorado potato beetle by as much as 95%. Trap cropping A trap crop is a crop of a plant that attracts pests, diverting them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, without the use of pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field. Pesticides Spraying pine logs with insecticide against Ips sexdentatus, a pine engraver beetle Pesticides are applied to crops by agricultural aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers, aerial spray by modern aircraft or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimized. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilizers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term. The efficacy of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages to survive the initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, some of the most serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations. Pesticides are formulated to kill pests, but many have detrimental effects on non-target species; of particular concern is the damage done to honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations. Spruce budworm (adult and pupa shown), a serious pest of forests, can be monitored using pheromone traps. =Forestry= Forest pests present a significant problem because it is not easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, the spruce budworm, a destructive pest of spruce and balsam fir, has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades. In some regions, such as New Brunswick, areas of forest are sprayed with pesticide to control the budworm population and prevent the damage caused during outbreaks. In homes and cities Many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings, industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers, chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss, others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance. Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides. =General methods= Physical pest control Dog control van, Rekong Peo, Himachal Pradesh, India Physical pest control involves trapping or killing pests such as insects and rodents. Historically, local people or paid rat-catchers caught and killed rodents using dogs and traps. On a domestic scale, sticky flypapers are used to trap flies. In larger buildings, insects may be trapped using such means as pheromones, synthetic volatile chemicals or ultraviolet light to attract the insects; some have a sticky base or an electrically charged grid to kill them. Glueboards are sometimes used for monitoring cockroaches and to catch rodents. Rodents can be killed by suitably baited spring traps and can be caught in cage traps for relocation. Talcum powder or \\"tracking powder\\" can be used to establish routes used by rodents inside buildings and acoustic devices can be used for detecting beetles in structural timbers. Historically, firearms have been one of the primary methods used for pest control. \\"Garden Guns\\" are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot or 9mm Flobert, and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for snakes, rodents, birds, and other pest. Garden Guns are short-range weapons that can do little harm past 15 to 20 yards, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly, injure livestock with a ricochet. They are also used for pest control at airports, warehouses, stockyards, etc. The most common shot cartridge is .22 Long Rifle loaded with #12 shot. At a distance of about , which is about the maximum effective range, the pattern is about in diameter from a standard rifle. Special smoothbore shotguns, such as the Marlin Model 25MG can produce effective patterns out to 15 or 20 yards using .22 WMR shotshells, which hold 1/8 oz. of #12 shot contained in a plastic capsule. Poisoned bait Rodent bait station, Chennai, India Poisoned bait is a common method for controlling rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches, and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets. Bait being placed in a rodent bait box. Warfarin has traditionally been used to kill rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and difenacoum may be substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly. Poisoned meat has been used for centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests. Fumigation Tent fumigation of a house in America Fumigation is the treatment of a structure to kill pests such as wood-boring beetles by sealing it or surrounding it with an airtight cover such as a tent, and fogging with liquid insecticide for an extended period, typically of 24‚Äì72 hours. This is costly and inconvenient as the structure cannot be used during the treatment, but it targets all life stages of pests. An alternative, space treatment, is fogging or misting to disperse a liquid insecticide in the atmosphere within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing, allowing most work within the building to continue, at the cost of reduced penetration. Contact insecticides are generally used to minimize long-lasting residual effects. Sterilization Populations of pest insects can sometimes be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others. Laboratory studies conducted with U-5897 (3-chloro-1,2-propanediol) were attempted in the early 1970s for rat control, although these proved unsuccessful. In 2013, New York City tested sterilization traps, demonstrating a 43% reduction in rat populations. The product ContraPest was approved for the sterilization of rodents by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in August 2016. Insulation Boron, a known pesticide can be impregnated into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at certain levels to achieve a mechanical kill factor for self- grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more. The addition of insulation into the attic and walls of a structure can provide control of common pests in addition to known insulation benefits such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic noise-canceling properties. The EPA regulates this type of general-use pesticide within the United States allowing it to only be sold and installed by licensed pest management professionals as part of an integrated pest management program. Simply adding Boron or an EPA-registered pesticide to an insulation does not qualify it as a pesticide. The dosage and method must be carefully controlled and monitored. =Methods for specific pests= Natural rodent control Brown rat infestation Several wildlife rehabilitation organizations encourage natural form of rodent control through exclusion and predator support and preventing secondary poisoning altogether. The United States Environmental Protection Agency notes in its Proposed Risk Mitigation Decision for Nine Rodenticides that \\"without habitat modification to make areas less attractive to commensal rodents, even eradication will not prevent new populations from recolonizing the habitat.\\" The United States Environmental Protection Agency has prescribed guidelines for natural rodent control and for safe trapping in residential areas with subsequent release to the wild. People sometimes attempt to limit rodent damage using repellents.

Insect pests including the Mediterranean flour moth, the Indian mealmoth, the cigarette beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil infest stored dry foods such as flour, cereals and pasta. In the home, foodstuffs found to be infested are usually discarded, and storing such products in sealed containers should prevent the problem from reoccurring. The eggs of these insects are likely to go unnoticed, with the larvae being the destructive life stage, and the adult the most noticeable stage. Since pesticides are not safe to use near food, alternative treatments such as freezing for four days at or baking for half an hour at should kill any insects present. Clothes moths Larva, pupa and adult clothes moth Tineola bisselliella with characteristic damage to fabric The larvae of clothes moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, particularly those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk, and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating and the use of chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used. Carpet beetles Carpet beetles are members of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are destructive pests in homes, warehouses, and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers, and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust, and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide, and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers. Bookworms Books are sometimes attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which feed on the covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage in the form of tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage. Evidence of attack may be found in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and specks of frass. Damage may be concentrated in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures. Beetles House timber split open to reveal larvae of the house longhorn beetle, Hylotrupes bajulus, in their burrows, which are partially filled with frass Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea superfamily attack the dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses and to make furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from the outside of the timber but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture. Termites Termites with colonies in close proximity to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Regular inspection of structures by a trained professional may help detect termite activity before the damage becomes substantial.; Inspection and monitoring of termites is important because termite alates (winged reproductives) may not always swarm inside a structure. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared with other members of the colony, which goes into slow decline. Mosquitoes Mosquito (Aedes aegypti) biting a human Mosquitoes are midge-like flies in the family Culicidae. Females of most species feed on blood and some act as vectors for malaria and other diseases. Historically they have been controlled by use of DDT and other chemical means, but since the adverse environmental effects of these insecticides have been realized, other means of control have been attempted. The insects rely on water in which to breed and the first line of control is to reduce possible breeding locations by draining marshes and reducing accumulations of standing water. Other approaches include biological control of larvae by the use of fish or other predators, genetic control, the introduction of pathogens, growth- regulating hormones, the release of pheromones and mosquito trapping. On airfields Jet engine fan blades damaged by bird strike Birds are a significant hazard to aircraft, but it is difficult to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas. Guidelines and legislation Guidelines and legislation regarding the usage permitted methods of application and the storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals vary from country to country, often being legislated by each state of territory. =Australia= Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Environment Protection Act 1997 ACT New South Wales South Australia Pesticides Regulations 2003 SA Pursuant to Controlled Substances Act 1984 SA Victoria Health (Pest Control) Regulations 2002 Vic pursuant to the Health Act 1958 Vic Western Australia Health (Pesticide) Regulations 1956 WA pursuant to Health Act 1911 WA =India= The Insecticides Act 1968 =Malaysia= Pesticide Act 1974 =Singapore= Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act =United Kingdom= Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949  See also  * Bee removal * Electronic pest control * Garden guns * IPM CRSP * Nuisance wildlife management * Rabbits in Australia References External links * Pest Control and Pesticide Safety for Consumers ","title":"Pest control"},{"id":"855300","text":"The Little Buffalo River is an U.S. Geological Survey.

History The band was formed in 1978 by singer Patrick Mata, who was influenced by musicians Throbbing Gristle, David Bowie and Joy Division as well as other artistic inspirations like Dadaism, anti- art, noise, musique concr√®te and the Brion Gysin/William Burroughs cut-up technique. Though initially named \\"Kommunity Fuck\\", after a piece of paste-up art created by Mata, the moniker was soon shortened. Mata has stated that the name was inspired by the cold shoulder given him by unimaginative local media venue talent buyers as well as industry powers. Kommunity FK's debut album, The Vision and the Voice, was released in 1983 by Independent Project Records, featuring a lineup of Mata, drummer Matt Chaikin and bassist CE CE. The follow-up, 1985's Close One Sad Eye, garnered significant attention when a video clip for the song \\"Something Inside Me Has Died\\" received significant play on MTV. By this time, Mata and Chaikin had been joined by bassist Kevin Kipnis and keyboardist Margaret Arana. After departing the band, Chaikin drummed for an early lineup of Jane's Addiction. Later Kommunity FK lineups included bassists Cam Campbell (A II Z, Sex Gang Children), Eddie Branch (UK Decay, Furyo, Peter Murphy) and Dave Roberts (Sex Gang Children, Carcrash International. In 2008, Kommunity FK returned with their third effort, the collection Abandoned Here... Planet Ruled By Bastards, issued on the Invisible Records label. Now a duo of Mata and guitarist/keyboardist Sherry Rubber, they followed it up with La Santisima Muerte (2010) on KommunityPM Rekords and Thee Image & Thee Myth (2015) on Crysella Records. During a Kommunity FK hiatus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mata led the band Sativa Luvbox, who released two albums: The Bad Sleep Well (1989, Splat-Co Records) and Beloved Satellite (1993, Gasoline Alley Records). Mata had earlier issued a 1979 single, \\"The Queen of Beverly Hills,\\" under his own name. Using the name Texylvania, he also covered songs on several tribute albums.

By the Buffalo River and the Duck River it is a tributary of the Tennessee River. The Green River is one of the main streams of Wayne County. Situated in the southwestern corner of Middle Tennessee along the Alabama line, Wayne County is one of the state's largest counties in area but is very sparsely populated. Most of the county is located on the Southern Highland Rim, an area of hills, ridges, and narrow stream valleys that is largely underlain by Paleozoic limestone. The Green River rises about southeast of the Wayne County seat of Waynesboro and flows northwest into that town, which is almost bisected by it, and then flows generally almost due north, albeit by a fairly meandering course, to its confluence with the Buffalo River just south of the Wayne County - Perry County line. It is the source of the Waynesboro municipal water supply. The river lives up to its name, often showing a deep bluish-green color, especially in its downstream reaches. This Green River should not be confused with the Green River in Kentucky, which is a tributary of the Ohio River and has a very small portion of its drainage basin in north-central Tennessee.

Dismissal (also referred to as firing) is the termination of employment by an employer against the will of the employee. Though such a decision can be made by an employer for a variety of reasons, ranging from an economic downturn to performance-related problems on the part of the employee, being fired has a strong stigma in some cultures. To be dismissed, as opposed to quitting voluntarily (or being laid off), is often perceived as being the employee's fault.Fired vs. Laid Off Connotations Finding new employment may often be difficult after being fired, particularly if there is a history of being terminated from a previous job, if the reason for firing is for some serious infraction, or the employee did not keep the job very long. Job seekers will often not mention jobs that they were fired from on their resumes; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment are often regarded as a red flag. Usage \\"Firing\\" is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term \\"firing\\" may have originated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being \\"sacked\\", \\"canned\\", \\"let go\\", \\"ran-off\\", \\"axed\\", \\"given walking papers\\", \\"given the pink slip\\" or \\"boned\\". Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include \\"to get the boot\\" and \\"to get the sack\\".Ayto, J., and Simpson, J. (1992). The Oxford dictionary of modern slang. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ; p. 24.Leland, L.S., jr. (1980). A personal Kiwi-Yankee dictionary. Dunedin, NZ: John McIndoe Ltd. ; p. 16. Reasons Most US states have adopted the at-will employment contract that allows the employer to dismiss employees without having to provide a justified reason for firing, although the variety of court cases that have come out of \\"at-will\\" dismissals have made such at-will contracts ambiguous. Often, an at-will termination is handled as a \\"layoff\\". Sometimes, an employee will be dismissed if an employer can find better employees than the incumbent, even if the fired employee has not technically broken any rules. This is common with probationary employees who were recently hired, but who cannot adjust to the environment of the workplace, or those who have been around for a long time, but can be replaced with a less experienced employee who can be paid a lower salary. In contrast, a dismissal in France is subjected to a just cause and a formal procedure.Alain-Christian Monkam, \\"How to dismiss an employee in France\\", Village de la Justice, 2011, http://www.village- justice.com/articles/dismiss-employee-France,11040.html Some examples include conflict of interest, where the employee has done nothing wrong, but the presence of the employee on the employer's payroll may be harmful to the employer. For example: * A close relative (spouse, sibling, child or parent) of a member of the executive management of a company might not be able to work for a competitor where they could know trade secrets or where they themselves are part of the other company's executive management due to requirements for competition or antitrust prohibitions. * This may be the case when two members of the same family become employed by the firm. * In other cases, those who report wrongdoing in the workplace, known as whistle blowers, put their job at risk because they might be retaliated against. More common reasons for firing include attendance problems, insubordination (talking back to a manager or supervisor), drinking alcoholic beverages or doing illegal drugs at work, or consuming the same substances before work and showing up to work while intoxicated or \\"high\\" (an especially serious problem in jobs where the worker drives a vehicle, boat or aircraft or operates heavy machinery) or off job- site conduct.10 Reasons Employees Get Fired - BeingFired.com Attendance problems include frequent absenteeism or tardiness, or even worse, the \\"no call, no show\\" in which an employee does not come to work and fails to notify the employer. Other attendance problems involve improper taking of breaks, such as taking extended or unauthorized breaks, failure to return from breaks in a timely manner, or walking off the premises or job site without approval from the supervisor. Work performance problems can lead to termination even with good attendance at a job. An employee may be fired if their work performance does not meet the employer's standards. Some of these issues may be lack of necessary skills required to perform duties, incompetence, failure to learn the required skills or processes, neglect of maintenance or safety procedures, refusal to perform duties, laziness, or negligence. Conduct problems can lead to firing if they continue over a long period. Behavioral issues may include unprofessional manners (especially in customer service jobs), constant or gross insubordination, inability to properly relate (i.e., get along) with co-workers, customers or both, arguing with supervisor, co- workers or customers, use of foul language while at work, and sleeping while on duty. With these conduct problems, the firing is frequently (but not always) part of a \\"progressive step\\" process, meaning the employee will have been warned and given an opportunity to improve before more severe measures are taken. Gross misconduct offenses can lead to immediate firing without any further warning. Gross misconduct includes damaging work equipment through negligence; discovery of false information on the job application (such as r√©sum√© fraud), fighting or brawling at work; harassment of other employees, such as sexual or racial harassment; use of employer's equipment (e.g. vehicles and computers) to engage in non-work-related activity or other violations of employer policies, illegal activity, or to view pornography; testing positive for illegal drug usage; failure to submit to a mandatory drug test (especially for transportation or heavy equipment-related jobs such as machine operators); engaging in illegal activities on the job (such as embezzlement or illegal subordinate harassment); or cheating the employer out of wages by \\"padding\\" a time sheet. In some cases, an employee's off-the-job behavior could result in job loss. A common example is drunk driving, especially if the employee's principal responsibilities require driving. Often, an employee getting charged with a crime will affect the employer's ability to trust the employee. Whether off-the-job criminal charges will result in termination relates to several factors, including the nature of the offense, the nature of the job, and the values of the employer. In some types of jobs, minor convictions that are not related to the job activities may not lead to termination; a ditch digger who works with a shovel who is convicted of drunk driving may not lose their job, while a food delivery driver who is convicted of drunk driving will lose their job. However, in some jobs, the perception of trust is very important, so even a non-job-related conviction, however minor, will result in termination, as in the case of banks, security firms, and schools. Another factor is the values of the employer; while some employers may believe that an employee should have a \\"second chance\\", other employers may have no tolerance for convicted individuals in their company, even if the employee has very little responsibility, as in the case of a manual labourer. Additional consequences Some fired employees may face additional consequences besides their dismissal. This may occur when the reason for the termination is a violation of criminal law, or if serious damages are caused to the employer as a result of the employee's actions. Such ex-employees may face criminal prosecution, a civil lawsuit, or a reporting to a database of those who have engaged in serious misconduct in such a position, so that the chances of ever obtaining a similar position with another employer are less likely (blacklisting). Some examples are a caregiver who engages in abuse, a bank teller who has stolen money from the cash drawer, or a member of law enforcement who has committed police brutality. For the most serious violations, especially when the employer's security may be at risk from the employee in question, a guard or officer may escort a fired employee from the workplace to the parking lot upon their dismissal. Such actions are often taken by government offices or large corporations that contain sensitive materials, and where the risk exists that the terminated employee may remove some of these materials or otherwise steal trade secrets in order to retaliate against the employer or use it to the advantage of a competing enterprise. Problem employees Though many employers would like to get rid of their \\"problem employees\\", some employers are reluctant to fire those who one would expect would be deserving of termination. There are many reasons for this, which may include:10 Reasons Bad Employees Don't Get Fired - AOL Find a Job Some positions may be hard to fill. This may be the case with a rare skilled position, or with certain low-wage jobs that are generally unattractive, where finding applicants is difficult. A person who has unusual skills, or who is doing a job that is considered undesirable, such as cleaning sewage from pipes, may be hard to replace. As such, a person in this position may be retained even if they have absenteeism or conduct problems. Another reason that bosses do not fire some problem employees is from a fear of retaliation. Sometimes the employer must be concerned about various types of action the former employee may take against the company, such as filing a wrongful termination suit: The terminated employee may take legal action in response to the firing. While laws vary in each country and jurisdiction, many employers keep extensive documentation of disciplinary action, evaluations, attendance records, and correspondence from supervisors, co-workers and customers in order to defend themselves in the event of such a suit. Additionally, the at- will employment contract, where the law permits, allows the employer to dismiss employees without having to provide a reason, though this has sometimes been challenged in court. As well, the employer may be concerned that the employee could make a negative report to public: by divulging things about the company to others, thereby hurting their business; or that the employee may disclose trade secrets: A former employee may remove materials or divulge confidential information from the former employer and use it with another employer or in an independent business. Some employers may be afraid that a worker may make a report to law enforcement, in the event that the employer's practices are illegal to the law. Other fears include the risk of sabotage by damaging machinery, erasing computer files, or shredding documents; or even violence; In some most extreme cases, fired employees have attacked or even killed their former employers or the staff at their old company or organization, sometimes known in slang as \\"going postal.\\" In some cases, this has occurred several months or years after termination. Some employers terminate their staff off-site to avoid these issues, or they ban any terminated staff on their premises. Other reasons include: *Unemployment insurance costs: In the United States of America and some other countries, such benefits are financed by employers. A firm's unemployment costs increase with each worker laid off or fired. *Relationship: The problem employee may have a special relationship with the boss, which is not necessarily romantic, but the employee may be a family member or close friend, or the employee may provide other needed connections for the employer. *Dependence on the employee: Despite the hardships the employee brings to the organization, the employer may find the employee useful in other ways. The employee may hold some rare knowledge or skill that is not easily replaceable. *Sympathy: A sympathetic boss may feel bad about firing an employee. *Culture: In some cultures, it is against the values of the employer to fire a long-serving, hard-working employee, even during an economic downturn (e.g., in Japan). =Counteractions= Employers have several methods of countering some of these potential threats. A common method is forced resignation, and it allows the employee to resign as if by choice, thereby freeing the employer of the burden of a firing. Other methods used by employers include: *Termination by mutual agreement: The employer and employee make a joint decision to end employment. Though it may be debatable if the termination was truly mutual, the employer offers the employee a \\"softened firing\\" in order to reduce backlash. *Severance package: The employee is offered some extended pay or benefits and a glowing reference in exchange for departure. In turn, the ex- employee agrees not to sue, file for unemployment, or take any other action that would hurt the employer. *Demotion: The employee is moved to a lower position, their hours or pay are cut, or the working environment is made increasingly unattractive in hopes of getting the employee to depart voluntarily. In some cases, the employee is officially kept as an employee, but offered little or no work. *Change of role: The employer may modify the employee's duties so the employee doesn't feel dishonored by the changes, but no longer performs the duties with which they were struggling. *Unpaid leave: To avoid being fired as a cost-cutting measure, an employee may agree to take time off without pay, either spread out over a long period (e.g., taking off one day a week without pay over a year), or concentrated (e.g., taking off one month without pay). = Forced resignations = A forced resignation is when an employee is required to depart from their position due to some issue caused by their continued employment. A forced resignation may be due to the employer's wishes to dismiss the employee, but the employer may be offering a softened firing, or in a high-profile position, the employee may want to leave before the press learns more negative information about one's controversial nature. To avoid this, and to allow the dismissed employee to \\"save face\\" in a more \\"graceful\\" exit, the employer will often ask the employee to resign \\"voluntarily\\" from their position. If the employee chooses not to resign, the processes necessary to fire them may be pursued, and the employee will usually be fired. The resignation thus makes it unclear whether the resignation was forced or voluntary, and this opaqueness may benefit both parties. Discriminatory and retaliatory termination In some cases, the firing of an employee is a discriminatory act. Although an employer may often claim the dismissal was for \\"just cause\\", these discriminatory acts are often because of the employee's legally protected characteristics, which vary from place to place. They may include physical or mental disability, age, race, religion, gender, HIV status or sexual orientation. Other unjust firings may result from a workplace manager or supervisor wanting to retaliate against an employee. Often, this is because the worker reported wrongdoing (often, but not always sexual harassment or other misconduct) on the part of the supervisor. Such terminations are often illegal. Many successful lawsuits have resulted from discriminatory or retaliatory termination. Under US law, workers are entitled to workplace decisions that do not discriminate against their membership in a protected group such as national origin, but they are not entitled to overall fairness. It is legal for an American employee to be fired for things such as disagreeing with the employer or not getting along well with others, even if the employee is correct. Discriminatory or retaliatory termination by a supervisor can take the form of administrative process. In this form the rules of the institution are used as the basis for termination. For example, if a place of employment has a rule that prohibits personal phone calls, receiving or making personal calls can be the grounds for termination even though it may be a common practice within the organization. Changes of conditions Employers who wish for an employee to exit of their own accord, but do not wish to pursue firing or forced resignation, may degrade the employee's working conditions, hoping that he or she will leave \\"voluntarily\\". The employee may be moved to a different geographical location, assigned to an undesirable shift, given too few hours if part-time, demoted (or relegated to a menial task), or assigned to work in uncomfortable conditions. Other forms of manipulation may be used, such as being unfairly hostile to the employee, and punishing them for things that are deliberately overlooked with other employees. Such tactics may amount to constructive dismissal, which is illegal in some jurisdictions. Rehire following termination Depending on the circumstances, a person whose employment has been terminated may not be eligible for being rehired by the same employer. If the decision to terminate was the employee's, the willingness of the employer to rehire is often contingent upon the relationship the employee had with the employer, the amount of notice given by the employee prior to departure, and the needs of the employer. In some cases, when an employee departed on good terms, they may be given special priority by the employer when seeking rehire. An employee may be terminated without prejudice, meaning the fired employee may be rehired for the same job in the future. This is usually true in the case of layoff. Conversely, a person can be terminated with prejudice, meaning an employer will not rehire the former employee for the same job in the future. This can be for many reasons: incompetence, misconduct (such as dishonesty or \\"zero tolerance\\" violations), policy violation, insubordination or \\"attitude\\" (personality clashes with peers or bosses). Termination forms (\\"pink slips\\" in the U.S.) routinely include a set of check boxes where a supervisor can indicate \\"with prejudice\\" or \\"without prejudice\\". During the Vietnam War, the CIA used this terminology with regard to its locally hired operatives. In the case of severe misconduct, it is alleged that the CIA would assassinate them or \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\".Douglas Valentine,The Phoenix Program, 1990.

The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However, main democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112). History It is said that the thought of writing constitutional law in Iran has existed since when Ruhollah Khomeini was driven away to Paris before the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in the Iranian Revolution. In other words, the thought of the Iranian constitution had existed in the second half of 1979 and its early draft had been written in Paris. Its draft also has been produced there and after that has been considered in Iran many times. Khomeini promised to the Iranian people the establishment of an assembly. This task was transferred to the provisional government by Mehdi Bazargan. The draft constitution published by the provisional government of Mehdi Bazargan in June 1979 was modeled on the 1958 constitution of the French Fifth Republic. Also provisional government transferred the task of establishment of assembly establishers to superieur council of revolution according to Islamic resources. Then, during a joint summit between the members of provisional government and superieur council of revolution with presence of Khomeini in Qom, it is ordained that there is no need to establish of assembly establishers and they rejected it. Also after that, it is ordaind that Assembly of Experts has to be established. The offices of the President and the Prime Minister were retained for the executive branch of government from the French model. According to the order of Rouhollah Khomeini, it was necessary to establish a congress in order to evaluate the constitution of Iran finally. The congress has been come to exist by 1358 solar. Nearly seventy three members of Majlis has been selected for evaluating the constitution who were from different minorities of religions, scientists, Athletes, and religious figures. The Majlis of finally evaluating of constitution begun his career during sixty seven sessions and in four rounds. The first round considered with preliminary evaluating of principles. The second round considered with providing principles in groups. The third round dealt with approbation of principles and the fourth round with investigation of all collection of principles. According to legal bill of council of revolution that constitution has placed to vote through referendum of yes or no and finally has been voted by 15578956 positive votes of Iranian people. It has been said that the republic is a kind of regime in which the chief of country and generally all responsible has to be selected whether directly or indirectly by people. In fact, republic system is a contrary to aristocracy in which the right of governing is hierarchical and at disposal of a definitive and minor groups. =1989 Amendments= On 24 April 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a decree convening an Assembly for Revising the Constitution. It made several changes in the constitution, in Articles 5, 107, 109, 111, eliminating the need for the Leader to be a marja or to be chosen by popular acclaim.Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, (2001), p.293 It made permanent the Expediency Discernment Council to work out disagreements between the Parliament and Council of Guardians, and eliminated the post of Prime Minister. The amendments were thought to be established because no marja had given strong support for Khomeini's policies -Brumberg, Daniel, Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran by Daniel Brumberg, University of Chicago Press 2001, p.146 The amendments were approved by the voting public on 28 July 1989 (in same election as Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected to the first of two terms as President of Iran).Abrahamian, Ervand, History of Modern Iran, Columbia University Press, 2008, p.183 Preamble The constitution begins by stating that the \\"anti-despotic movement for constitutional government [1906-1911], and anti-colonialist movement for the nationalization of petroleum\\" in 1950s failed because of lack of religious coloring thereunder. Moreover, the \\"central axis\\" of the theocracy shall be Quran and hadith. The preamble further states: \\"The Assembly of Experts for Constitution...fram[ed] the Constitution...[after input] by the government...with the hope that this century will witness the establishment of a universal holy government and the downfall of all others.\\"Framers' agenda -- Dead link! (See also: Mahdi and Mohammed al-Mahdi) Chapter I [Article 1 to 14]: General Principles =Article 1 (Form of Government)= Article 1 states that the form of Government in Iran is that of an Islamic Republic.

These goals cover general topics in governance. For example: * Support good moral values based on faith * Fight all forms of vice and corruption * Raise public awareness through the proper use of the mass media and press * Free education * Free physical training * Strengthening advanced scientific research * The elimination of imperialism and foreign influence * The elimination of despotism, autocracy and monopoly * Ensure social and political freedoms within the law * The end to all forms of undesirable discrimination These goals were designed to emphasize positive liberty. Some of the goals are put in context of the requirements of Islam. For example: * The planning of a just economic system * Public cooperation of all people * The creation of the government's foreign policy Commentary The principles of faith and piety are necessary conditions of creating a good society. Therefore, that is needed some initiative actions such as cleaning the environment. That action is to policies like codification of rules of social justice and removing any type of social gap; creating the administrative system; reformation of judicial system according to Islamic regulations. Reducing the phenomena of being illiterate; rejecting the tyranny and being participated of all people in all affairs and refinement of souls. =Article 4 (Islamic Principle)= Article 4 is immutable and the Council of Guardians ensures that all articles of the Constitution as well other laws are based on Islamic criteria. =Article 5 (Office of Religious Leader)= This article explains the leaders of Ummah must choose a leader in accordance with Article 107 for this office. This is stated to be related to the disappearance of the Twelfth Imam whom it asks God to return. Chapter II [Article 15 to 18]: The Official Language, Script, Calendar, and Flag of the Country =Official Language= Article 15 states that the \\"Official language and writing script (of Iran)... is Persian ...[and]... the use of regional and tribal languages in the press and mass media, as well as for teaching of their literature in schools, is allowed in addition to Persian.\\" Per Article 16, \\"Since the language of the Qur'an and Islamic texts ... is Arabic it must be taught ... in school from elementary grades until the end of high school.\\" Chapter III [Article 19 to 42]: The Rights of the People Article 23 of the Iranian constitution holds that ‚Äúthe investigation of individuals‚Äô beliefs is forbidden, and no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief.‚Äù Article 24 \\"Publications and the press are free to discuss issues unless such is deemed harmful to the principles of Islam or the rights of the public. The law shall determine the details of this exception.\\" Article 27 provides for freedom of assembly, \\"provided arms are not carried\\" and the assemblies \\"are not detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam\\". Article 37 provides for the presumption of innocence, stating: \\"Innocence is to be presumed, and no one is to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court.\\" Article 29 [Welfare benefits] is a universal right of all to enjoy social insurance or other forms of security for retirement, unemployment, old-age disability, lack of guardianship, being a wayfarer, accident and the need for health and treatment services and medical care. The government, in accordance with the laws and by drawing on national revenues, is required to provide such insurance and economic protection to each and every citizen of the country. Chapter IV [Article 43 to 55]: Economy and Financial Affairs Article 44: The Islamic Republic is not a Communist state as the Islamic scholars fiercely oppose this.

Therapeutically, it acts as both an antagonist and antidote to benzodiazepines (particularly in cases of overdose), through competitive inhibition. It was first characterized in 1981, and was first marketed in 1987 by Hoffmann-La Roche under the trade name Anexate. However, it did not receive FDA approval until December 20, 1991. The developer lost its exclusive patent rights in 2008; so at present, generic formulations of this drug are available. Intravenous flumazenil is primarily used to treat benzodiazepine overdoses and to help reverse anesthesia. Administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has also been tested.http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01183312 Medical uses Flumazenil benefits patients who become excessively drowsy after use of benzodiazepines for either diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The drug has been used as an antidote in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdoses. It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by competitive inhibition at the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. There are many complications that must be taken into consideration when used in the acute care setting. These include lowered seizure threshold, agitation, and anxiousness. Flumazenil's short half-life requires multiple doses. Because of the potential risks of withdrawal symptoms and the drug's short half-life, patients must be carefully monitorered to prevent recurrence of overdose symptoms or adverse side effects. Flumazenil is also sometimes used after surgery to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. This is similar to naloxone's application to reverse the effect of opiates and opioids following surgery. Administration of the drug requires careful monitoring by an anesthesiologist due to potential side effects and serious risks associated with over-administeration. Likewise, post-surgical monitoring is also necessary because flumazenil can mask the apparent metabolization (\\"wearing off\\") of the drug after removal of patient life-support and monitoring equipment. Flumazenil has been effectively used to treat overdoses of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone (also known as \\"Z-drugs\\"). It may also be effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness while improving vigilance in primary hypersomnias, such as idiopathic hypersomnia. The drug has also been used in hepatic encephalopathy. It may have beneficial short‚Äêterm effects in people with cirrhosis, but there is no evidence for long-term benefits. The onset of action is rapid, and effects are usually seen within one to two minutes. The peak effect is seen at six to ten minutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 Œºg every 1‚Äì2 minutes until the effect is seen, up to a maximum of 3 mg per hour. It is available as a clear, colourless solution for intravenous injection, containing 500 Œºg in 5 mL. Many benzodiazepines (including midazolam) have longer half-lives than flumazenil. Therefore, in cases of overdose, repeat doses of flumazenil may be required to prevent recurrent symptoms once the initial dose of flumazenil wears off. It is hepatically metabolised to inactive compounds which are excreted in the urine. Individuals who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may suffer benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including seizure, upon rapid administration of flumazenil. It is not recommended for routine use in those with a decreased level of consciousness. In terms of drug enforcement initiatives, diversion control programs and required post-marketing surveillance of adverse events, orders for flumazenil may trigger a prescription audit to the search for benzodiazepine misuse and for clinically significant adverse reactions related to their use. =PET radioligand= Radiolabeled with the radioactive isotope carbon-11, flumazenil may be used as a radioligand in neuroimaging with positron emission tomography to visualize the distribution of GABAA receptors in the human brain. Treatment for benzodiazepine dependence & tolerance In Italy, the gold standard for treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine dependency is 8‚Äì10 days of low-dose, slowly infused flumazenil. One addiction treatment centre in Italy has used flumazenil to treat over 300 patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (up to 70 times higher than conventionally prescribed) with physicians being among the clinic's most common patients. Epileptic patients who have become tolerant to the anti- seizure effects of the benzodiazepine clonazepam became seizure-free for several days after treatment with 1.5 mg of flumazenil. Similarly, patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (median dosage 333 mg diazepam-equivalent) were able to be stabilised on a low dose of clonazepam after 7‚Äì8 days of treatment with flumazenil. Flumazenil has been tested against placebo in benzo-dependent subjects. Results showed that typical benzodiazepine withdrawal effects were reversed with few to no symptoms. Flumazenil was also shown to produce significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than saline in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with benzodiazepine- dependent subjects. Additionally, relapse rates were much lower during subsequent follow-up. In vitro studies of tissue cultured cell lines have shown that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhanced the benzodiazepine binding site where such receptors have become more numerous and uncoupling/down-regulation of GABAA has been reversed. After long-term exposure to benzodiazepines, GABAA receptors become down-regulated and uncoupled. Growth of new receptors and recoupling after prolonged flumazenil exposure has also been observed. It is thought this may be due to increased synthesis of receptor proteins. Flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4‚Äì266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Low- dose, slow subcutaneous flumazenil administration is a safe procedure for patients withdrawing from long-term, high-dose benzodiazepine dependency. It has a low risk of seizures even amongst those who have experienced convulsions when previously attempting benzodiazepine withdrawal. Clinical pharmacology Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. It also exhibits weak partial agonism of GABAA receptor complexes that contain Œ±6-type monomers; the clinical relevance of this is unknown. Flumazenil does not antagonize all of the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, and most anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids. It will however antagonize the action of non-benzodiazepine z-drugs, such as zolpidem and zopiclone, because they act via the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor \\\\- it has been used to successfully treat z-drug overdose. Pharmacodynamics Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory depression produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers. The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil.  Availability  Flumazenil is sold under a wide variety of brand names worldwide like Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, Romazicon. In India it is manufactured by Roche Bangladesh Pharmaceuticals and USAN Pharmaceuticals.

They broke onto the visual kei scene alongside a multitude of other artists in the early 1990s and enjoyed a decade of relative popularity before disbanding in early 2002. The members have reunited several times since 2007 for one-off concerts and short tours. Outside Japan, Siam Shade is best known for \\"1/3 no Junjou na Kanjou\\", which was the sixth ending theme of the Rurouni Kenshin anime. History =1989‚Äì2002: Formation and career= In March 1989, high school friends Hideki (then known as \\"Chack\\") and Natchin (then spelled \\"Natin\\") formed a band called Power. They won the Summer Grand Prix Award at that year's Yokohama High School Hot Wave Festival. However, due to many member changes, including the brief enrollment of guitarist Daita, Power disbanded. After befriending guitarist Ataru, singer Hideki and bassist Natchin formed a new band with him called At√¶ru in 1991. In 1992, the members met Love Jets vocalist Kazuma at a talent show, and later recruited him as guitarist. Drummer A completed the lineup and At√¶ru began touring, playing small clubs and local venues. They changed their name in 1993, settling on Siam Shade. The band released a free demo tape on May 1, shortly after which Ataru left. In July, Hideki and Natchin called on their former schoolmate and one-time band member Daita to fill in the lead guitar slot. The group distributed the single \\"Doll\\" in December 1993. The band became close with Luna Sea, with Ryuichi Kawamura promoting Siam Shade in 1994 by playing their demo tape on his radio show. Siam Shade had another small lineup change in 1994 when A left the band and was replaced by Jun-ji in May, solidifying the group's final lineup. Jun-ji was a roadie for Luna Sea drummer Shinya Yamada. At the end of the year, the band released their first self- titled album. In 2004, it was named one of the top albums from 1989-1998 in an issue of the music magazine Band Yarouze. In October 1995, Siam Shade released their major label debut single \\"Rain\\" on Sony Music Entertainment Japan. Their second album Siam Shade II followed in November. The band burst into the mainstream in late 1996 when \\"1/3 no Junjou na Kanjou\\", a single from their latest album Siam Shade IV, was selected as an ending theme for the Rurouni Kenshin anime series. The song's popularity led to increased ticket sales, concert DVDs, and television appearances. The band continued to release albums and DVDs well into the next decade. In 2002, while touring in support of their recently released compilation albums, the band announced that they would be disbanding. Siam Shade's ten-year career came to an end on March 11, 2002 at the Nippon Budokan. Later that month, the band released their final album, Siam Shade X, a compilation of all their previous releases. =Post-Siam Shade activities= After the disbandment Hideki quickly begin his solo career. In 2003, he joined the band Acid, before leaving in 2006 to focus on his solo career again. However, in 2007 he formed Detrox with KAZ (Sads) and they released a large amount of material before going on hiatus after their show on April 18, 2012. Kazuma also started his solo career after the disbanding. In 2003, he performed a duet with Vivian Hsu, \\"Moment\\", which was used as the second opening theme to the anime Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. He has also played support guitar for Anna Tsuchiya and Damijaw (solo project of Janne Da Arc member Ka-yu). Daita started a solo career, wrote the soundtrack for the movie Volcano High, and played support guitar for Kyosuke Himuro. In 2005 he formed the band Binecks. In 2012, he formed the American-based band Broken Arrow with vocalist Nik Frost, who sang on the Siam Shade Tribute album. Natin, now going by the stage-name \\"Natchin\\", has a solo career and in 2008 formed the band Big Bites with Anchang (Sex Machineguns) and Annie (The Yellow Monkey). Junji has a solo career, was support drummer for Takanori Nishikawa a.k.a. TM Revolution, and in 2008 formed the band Bull Zeichen 88. He is also a regular support member for Acid Black Cherry. =2007‚Äì2016: Reunions= Siam Shade held a reunion concert, titled Heart of Rock, on November 18, 2007 at the Nippon Budokan, in honor of their manager who died the previous April. The band stated that the reunion was a one-off event, and would not pave the way for a new single or album release. On October 27, 2010 a tribute album to Siam Shade was released, Siam Shade Tribute. It is composed entirely of Western artists such as Sebastian Bach, Richie Kotzen, Mike Vescera and George Lynch. Siam Shade's song \\"1/3 no Junjou na Kanjou\\" was covered by Nogod on the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement. \\"Glacial Love\\" was covered by Guild on its sequel, Crush! 2 -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, that was released on November 23, 2011. On April 29, 2011, Siam Shade announced on their new website, which went online on the same day, that they would reunite once again. This time for a free concert on July 17 at Zepp Sendai, entitled Siam Shade Spirits ~Return The Favor~, \\"to bring hope\\" to the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. A second concert was held on October 21 at Saitama Super Arena. The band released the album Siam Shade Spirits 1993 on April 14, 2012, which includes their entire first album, the new \\"opening\\" track called \\"Light For Closed Your Eyes\\" and two previously unreleased songs from their indie years. The group released their first new song in 12 years \\"Still We Go\\" digitally on September 18, 2013, with a limited physical release following the next month. Siam Shade performed their first nationwide tour in 12 years at the end of 2013, titled Heart of Rock 7. The three date tour began on October 27 at Saitama Super Arena and went to Zepp Nagoya on November 11, before ending on November 12 at Zepp Namba. Siam Shade performed at the first night of Luna Sea's Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe on June 27, 2015. In celebration of the 20th anniversary since their major label debut, the group held The Abiding Belief concert at Saitama Super Arena on October 18, 2015. The six date The Ultimate Fight Series tour continued the celebration and took place in February 2016 at various Zepp venues. The anniversary celebration ended with three Final Road Last Sanctuary concerts in October 2016; the Osaka International Convention Center on the tenth, the Nakano Sun Plaza Hall on the fifteenth, and the last taking place on the twentieth at the Nippon Budokan.

It was long thought to either be a subspecies or color variation of Solenopsis invicta (red imported fire ant; RIFA), but is now recognized as its own species with a demonstratively different range and living habits. BIFA seem to be more tolerant of cold and a less dominant species than RIFA. The species is native to South America, but has been introduced to North America. In the United States, the official assessment is that BIFA are limited to extreme northeast Mississippi, northwest Alabama and a few southern counties in Tennessee,Timothy C. Lockley. Imported Fire Ant Station, USDA/APHIS/PPQ, Gulfport, MS 39501 though this may reflect underestimation of their range. As of April 2013 their range has been found as far north as the tidewater area of Virginia, and as of July 2016 they have been reported near coastal South Carolina. Since the 2013 records, this species has been collected in NE Arkansas in several Craighead County localities. These collections are presumably the result of recent landscaping of new construction projects.

The show featured the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy entertainers, athletes, socialites and business moguls. It was hosted by Robin Leach for the majority of its run. When Leach was joined by Shari Belafonte in 1994, the show was renamed Lifestyles with Robin Leach and Shari Belafonte. Leach ended each episode with a wish for his viewers that became his signature catchphrase, \\"champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\\" The theme song, titled \\"Come with Me Now\\" and performed by Bill Conti, is from a 1979 film called Five Days from Home. Synopsis Lifestyles was one of the first shows to feature the lives of the wealthy. Later shows such as VH1's The Fabulous Life Of... continued this trend. The show was largely intended to be an insight into the opulent residences and the glamorous lifestyles of those it profiled. However, many of the geographic areas it covered were ideal destinations for vacations, and in his on-camera appearances, Leach indirectly made references to resorts and tourist attractions. David Greenspan (aka David Perry), who was the voice-over narrator for most of the segments during the bulk of the show's run and could be heard whenever Leach did not appear on camera, made more direct references to such resorts and such tourist attractions during his tenure as the show's voice-over narrator. Lifestyles was created by Alfred M. \\"Al\\" Masini, who had also created Solid Gold, Entertainment Tonight, and Star Search; all of these were part of his Operation Prime Time project, which he later renamed Television Program Enterprises and later merged with Rysher Entertainment to form Rysher TPE, though Solid Gold or Entertainment Tonight were never syndicated by TPE or Rysher but all 4 are now owned by CBS Television Distribution. Spinoff Lifestyles had two companion spinoff series, Runaway with the Rich and Famous, also hosted by Leach. The series also aired in first-run syndication, from 1986 to 1994. There was also Fame, Fortune and Romance broadcast on ABC from 1986 to 1987. Reboot In 2013, the Style network was originally going to reboot Lifestyles of The Rich and Famous but did not move forward when the network was later rebranded as the Esquire Network. In 2014, a source said that a new version of Lifestyles would be remade for NBC hosted by Nick Cannon unlike the original, this version was going to be mostly focused Cannon's point of view as well as feature profiles of the mega-rich. This version would also feature tech billionaires who are quickly becoming the new face of wealth it was also said that philanthropic efforts would also be covered. According to Cannon, he said that \\"Robin Leach passed the torch to me, now I'm producing and hosting the new Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\"; he also said \\"You know what? I think rich and famous people take themselves too seriously, I'm gonna be just like I am on this show America's Got Talent. I'll be like, What the hell? Gold toilet seats? Let's pop bottles\\". The idea was scrapped later on. Merchandise A board game called Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous: The GameLifestyles of the Rich and Famous: The Game was released by Pressman in 1987.

Depending on the game, different activities constitute cheating and it is either a matter of game policy or consensus opinion as to whether a particular activity is considered to be cheating. Cheating reportedly exists in most multiplayer online games, but it is difficult to measure. The Internet and darknets can provide players with the methodology necessary to cheat in online games, sometimes in return for a price. Bots and software assistance =Aimbots and triggerbots= An aimbot (sometimes called \\"auto- aim\\") is a type of computer game bot most commonly used in multiplayer first- person shooter games to provide varying levels of automated target acquisition and calibration to the player. They are sometimes used along with a TriggerBot, which automatically shoots when an opponent appears within the field-of-view or aiming reticule of the player, like an instantaneous reflex. Aimbotting relies on each player's client computer receiving information about all other players, whether they are visible from the player's position or not. Targeting is a matter of determining the location of any opponent relative to the player's location and pointing the player's weapon at the target. This targeting works regardless of whether the opponent is behind walls or too far away to be seen directly. Some servers allow inactive players to spectate, watching the game from the viewpoints of the active players. Recording of gameplay actions is also often possible. If someone was using a targeting aimbot, the bot would be obvious to the spectator as unnatural exact position tracking. Some aimbots and triggerbots attempt to hide from spectators the fact they are being used through a number of methods, such as delaying firing to hide the fact it shoots the instant an opponent is in the cheater's crosshair. Some Triggerbot programs can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard. Cheat suites may incorporate these in addition to other features, including adjustments to extrasensory perception (ESP), move speed, ammo count, and player radar. Neophytes may colloquially define these suites as aimbot programs. =Artificial lag/lag switch= In the peer-to-peer gaming model, lagging is what happens when the stream of data between one or more players gets slowed or interrupted, causing movement to stutter and making opponents appear to behave erratically. By using a lag switch, a player is able to disrupt uploads from the client to the server, while their own client queues up the actions performed. The goal is to gain advantage over another player without reciprocation; opponents slow down or stop moving, allowing the lag switch user to easily outmaneuver them. From the opponent's perspective, the player using the device may appear to be teleporting, invisible or invincible, while the opponents suffer delayed animations and fast-forwarded game play, delivered in bursts. Some gaming communities refer to this method as \\"tapping\\" which refers to the users \\"tapping\\" on and off their internet connection to create the lag. The term \\"lag switch\\" encompasses many methods of disrupting the network communication between a client and its server. One method is by attaching a physical device, called a hardware lag switch, to a standard Ethernet cable. By flipping the switch on and off, the physical connection between the client and the server is disrupted. The designers of video game console hardware have started to introduce built-in protection against lag switches in the form of voltage detectors, which detect a change in voltage when the switch is flipped. Some manufacturers have taken counter measures to bypass or trick this detector. This can also be achieved by simply unplugging the Ethernet cord going to the client, causing a disruption in the player's internet connection. Other methods, called a software or wireless lag switch, involve using a computer program. In this method, the cheater runs an application on a computer connected to the same network as the client. The application hogs the network bandwidth, disrupting the communication between the client and its server. However, one cannot do this for an unlimited amount of time. At some point, if no traffic is being received, most game clients and/or game servers will decide that the connection has been lost and will remove the player from the game. More advanced methods are firewall or router rules that apply bandwidth shaping and network latency, a cheat is able to adjust limits on both bandwidth and latency to stay relevant to a P2P network yet have considerable advantage over other players. =Look-ahead= Look- ahead cheating is a method of cheating within a peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming architecture where the cheating client gains an unfair advantage by delaying their actions to see what other players do before announcing its own action. A client can cheat using this method by acting as if it is suffering from high latency; the outgoing packet is forged by attaching a time-stamp that is prior to the actual moment the packet is sent, thereby fooling other clients into thinking that the action was sent at the correct time, but was delayed in arrival. A partial solution is the lockstep protocol. =World- hacking= World-hacking is a method or third-party program that enables a user to exploit bugs and to view more of a level than intended by the developer. A common aspect of real-time strategy games is the player's partial limitation or complete inability to see beyond the visibility range of individual game objects that are under their ownership (typically units and structures); this concept is controlled by a mechanism known as the fog of war. World-hacking usually enables the user to bypass this mechanism, either by removing it entirely and/or by rendering objects through the fog that would not normally be visible. In multiplayer modes, this allows for a distinct advantage against the other players who are subject to the intended settings. The advantage gained can be substantial, especially for the average real-time strategy games that rely on the rock paper scissors dynamic to balance out individual objects' varying strengths and weaknesses. World-hacking may also allow a player to see through solid or opaque objects and/or manipulate or remove textures, to know in advance when an opponent is about to come into targeting range from an occluded area. This can be done by making wall textures transparent, or modifying the game maps to insert polygonal holes into otherwise solid walls. This variation is commonly known as a \\"wallhack\\" since it basically allows to the player to see enemies through walls. World- hacking relies on the fact that an FPS server usually sends raw positional information for all players in the game, and leaves it up to the client's 3D renderer to hide opponents behind walls, in plant foliage, or in dark shadows. If the game map rendering could be turned off completely, all players could be seen moving around in what appears to be empty space. Complete map hiding offers no advantage to a cheater as they would be unable to navigate the invisible map pathways and obstacles. However, if only certain surfaces are made transparent or removed, this leaves just enough of an outline of the world to allow the cheater still to navigate it easily. Asus released wireframe display drivers in 2001 that enabled players to use wallhacks, announcing the settings as \\"special weapons\\" that users could employ in multiplayer games. In a poll by the Online Gamers Association, 90% of its members were against the release of the drivers. =Removal of game elements= Removals allow the cheater to remove a game's inhibitors or annoyances. These include gun recoil, bullet spread, and obfuscating visual effects. Such removals can significantly decrease a user's skill requirement levels. Unsporting play =Boosting / Win trading= Players will set up multiple accounts and play one against the other. Usually, the primary account will get an easy win due to a deliberate lack of resistance from the second account due to it being unplayed or agreed by the player of that account to lose. The major problem with this method is its high cost because the boosting player requires at least two instances of the program usually through different PCs, IP addresses, and copies of the game. Additionally, some games allow the replays of matches to be uploaded and viewed by others. If the boosting player accidentally allows this, their boosting match can be seen by others. Some players will reverse roles between games, giving each account an equal win/loss record. Even without matches being seen, players who boost can usually be easily identified, since they will have an unnaturally high number of points in relation to the number of matches played. =Disconnecting= In games where wins and losses are recorded on a player's account, a player may disconnect when he or she is about to lose in order to prevent that loss from being recorded. This is usually done by activating known in-game glitches and through third-party sources via \\"IP booting\\" (a feature of firewall software). Some players do this if they feel their opponent is being unfair. Some games implement a disconnection penalty, usually by recording the disconnect as a loss or a deduction of experience points. Certain games also have a 'disconnect delay' period before the player can disconnect that can last 10‚Äì30 seconds. This prevents a player from instantly disconnecting if they are about to die or lose. In some games, if a player disconnects they can receive a warning or even get locked out of online play for a short period. =Rapid Fire Modifications (Macros)= In many games the weapons featured can be fired in burst fire or single shot fire modes. Modifying a controller or keyboard/mouse to gain the advantage of having a faster firing weapon than the standard player can be considered a method of cheating. These modifications can create an imbalance within the game. In addition to modifying a console or its controller, it is possible to achieve a similar effect on the PC by binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse or using a macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically. However, most games limit the rate at which weapons can be fired regardless of how fast a player presses the button, in order to limit this form of cheating. =Exploits= Exploiting is the application of an unintended feature or bug that gives the player an advantage not intended by the game design. Exploiting is generally considered cheating by the gaming community at large due to the unfair advantage usually gained by the exploiter. Most software developers of online games prohibit exploiting in their terms of service and often issue sanctions against players found to be exploiting. There is some contention by exploiters that exploiting should not be considered cheating as it is merely taking advantage of actions allowed by the software. Some players view exploiting as a skill because certain exploits take a significant amount of time to find, or dexterity and timing to use. =Farming and stat-padding= In games where achievements and rewards are unlocked by defeating human enemies, especially in unorthodox ways, players may arrange to win or lose against one another in order to obtain the achievements without having to play the game linearly. This is also known as stat-padding, swapping, or boosting. The term farming also refers to the practice of garnering achievements or virtual property for the purpose of real-money-trading. With rare exception, this has no direct effect on the gaming experience of other players; instead, it is a violation of most EULAs and could devalue the virtual property being farmed. =Character sharing= Sharing is when multiple people take turns playing as a single character ‚Äî mainly in MMORPGs ‚Äî to gain an advantage by spending more time per day on leveling or farming than an average player would, and consequently having higher stats or better equipment. =Twinking= Twinking is the act of transferring gear intended for higher level characters to lower level characters that would be incapable of obtaining the gear on their own. Twinked characters have a huge advantage over untwinked characters, as well as the rest of the game world. This is usually used by players who wish to create a new character, either to help them level more rapidly or to gain an unfair advantage in PvP (i.e. player versus player, a type of multiplayer interactive conflict). Most MMORPGs tolerate it, provided that the twinked character is not used in PvP combat against non- twinked characters. Often limits on twinking are placed into the game, usually through strict level or stat requirements to equip the item. Circumventing these level requirements would then be further cheating. =Ghosting= Most games allow other participants to observe the game as it is played from a variety of perspectives; depending on the game, perspectives allow an observer a map overview or attach a \\"camera\\" to the movement of a specific player. In doing so, the observer can communicate with an accomplice using a secondary communication methodology (in-game private message, third party communication, or even off-line) to inform friendly players of traps or the position of opponents. An observer can be an active player, using a separate computer, connection and account. Some systems prevent inactive players from observing the game if they are on the same IP address as an active player, on the grounds that they are probably in close physical proximity; when all players from a single IP address are no longer active participants, they are all allowed to observe. However, this restriction can be easily evaded if there are multiple IP addresses available at one location (a common feature of broadband subscriptions), or if the observer installs remote desktop software on their computer, thus enabling their computer screen to be viewed by select other players in real time. Additionally, this may be used against players livestreaming to platforms like Twitch to observe the player and their team's position and stats. This is often referred to as stream sniping. =Secret alliances= Also known as \\"teaming\\", this form of cheating occurs when two or more players conspire to engage a secret, unofficial alliance of co-operative play to give themselves an unfair advantage over other players. It is considered cheating in many games that have a free for all deathmatch or Last man standing mode. Characteristics of this cheating, in particular, is when players in the same multiplayer server engage in secondary communication between each other using third party software and/or using remote desktop software to observe the screens of the secret \\"allies\\" while one is playing that offers considerable tactical and/or strategic advantages over all other players outside of the \\"alliance\\". This type of cheating is very problematic in some games because it is often very difficult to prove as there is no hacking, exploits or game modifications involved, usually requiring the intervention of game server admins to monitor multiplayer sessions in order to catch players engaging in acts of teaming. =Stacking= Stacking involves altering game settings or team lineups to give one or more teams an unfair advantage over others. One example includes arranging a team composed of skilled or professional players against a team with members of lesser skill. Although this may be a valid and accepted practice in real-life sports, in online games stacking upsets less-skilled players who feel that they aren't being given a fair chance. Less ethical rigging involves weighting the game by providing a player or team with an advantage by outfitting them with better (or more familiar) weapons or equipment, or creating a play field that caters to a certain player, team or playing style. This also may involve creating team-size inequalities, for example a 5 vs 10 match. Many games prevent this by preventing players from joining a team with more players than the opposing side, forcing newcomers to balance the teams. =Scripting= Scripting is the use of a program or game feature to automate certain actions or behaviors. The use of scripts may or may not be considered cheating, depending on the behavior involved, and whether said behavior is replicable without the use of such script. A script may give the user unusually fast firing rate, unobtainable otherwise, or may perform seemingly trivial tasks such as reloading. Some scripts can also tamper with other players systems by spoofing commands. Implementation of cheats In the client‚Äìserver model, the server is responsible for information security and enforcing game rules. (See \\"Anti- cheating methods and limitations\\" below for drawbacks.) In the peer-to-peer gaming model, clients run equal code but are still subject to most of the same type of cheats found in the client‚Äìserver multiplayer model; however, the peer-to-peer multiplayer model has deprecated in favor of the client‚Äìserver model with the wider adoption of high-speed networks.https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ayahyavi/files/Yahyavi- CSUR13-P2PMMOG.pdf (page 2)https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2005/papers/p2p-mmg.pdf (page 2) \\"Never trust the client\\" is a maxim among game developers (as well as other developers) that summarizes the model of client‚Äìserver game design.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/hackers-cheats- ruined-the-division-pc- ubisofthttps://web.archive.org/web/20170510170653/https://gafferongames.com/2016/04/25/never- trust-the-client/https://improbable.io/blog/trond-simple-techniques-against- cheating-in-spatialos It means that no information sent from a client should be accepted by a server if it breaks the game rules or the basic mechanics of the game, and that no information should be sent to a client unless it is \\"need-to-know.\\" For example, a server with no rule enforcement or data integrity checking will synchronize all of the clients with all of the information about all of the other clients. The server will be very fast, but any wallhack program will reveal where all the players in the game are, what team they are on, and what state they're in ‚Äî health, weapon, ammo etc. At the same time, altered and erroneous data from a client will allow a player to break the game rules, manipulate the server, and even manipulate other clients. =Game code modification= Many cheats are implemented by modifying game software, despite EULAs which forbid modification. While game software distributed in binary-only versions makes it harder to modify code, reverse engineering is possible. Also game data files can be edited separately from the main program and thereby circumvent protections implemented in software. =System software modification= Rather than modifying the game code (which the game itself or a 3rd-party protection system may detect), some cheats modify underlying system components. An example of this is graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking and draw all objects on the screen‚Äîa primitive wallhack. System or driver modification is harder to detect, as there are a large number of system drivers that differ from user to user. =Packet interception and manipulation= The security of game software can be circumvented by intercepting and/or manipulating data (divided into \\"packets\\") in real-time while in transit from the client to the server or vice versa (i.e. a man-in-the-middle attack). Interception can be passive or result in active manipulation; either method can be performed on the client machine itself or via an external communication proxy; some aimbots incorporate this method. Anti-cheating methods and limitations There are many facets of cheating in online games which make the creation of a system to stop cheating very difficult; however, game developers and third party software developers have created or are developing technologies that attempt to prevent cheating. Such countermeasures are commonly used in video games, with notable anti-cheat software being GameGuard, PunkBuster, Valve Anti-Cheat (specifically used on games on the Steam platform), and EasyAntiCheat. Exploits of bugs are usually resolved/removed via a patch to the game; however, not all companies force the patches/updates on users, leaving the actual resolution to individual users. =Authoritative and mirrored server design= Generally, the better the server is at enforcing the rules, the less of a problem cheating will be in the game. In this approach all client functionality either runs purely on the game server or alternatively the game server mirrors the client gameplay and continuously validates the game state. In many mobile games, it is a common practice to run the client game sessions synchronously on the server, using exactly the same user input. The client session is reset when the game sessions become unsynced, thereby preventing cheating. Server-side game code makes a trade-off between calculating and sending results for display on a just-in-time basis or trusting the client to calculate and display the results in appropriate sequence as a player progresses. It can do this by sending the parts of the world state needed for immediate display, which can result in client lag under bandwidth constraints, or sending the player the entire world state, which results in faster display for the player under the same bandwidth constraints, but exposes that data to interception or manipulation‚Äîa trade-off between security and efficiency. When game servers were restricted by limited available resources such as storage, memory, internal bandwidth, and computational capacity due to the technologies available and the cost of the hardware, coupled with internet connections that were slow, it was believed to be necessary to compromise on security for optimization to minimize the impact on the end-user. Today however, with the increased speed and power of multi- core computers, lower-priced hardware, and the increased availability of broadband internet, this has become less of an issue. =Software obfuscation= Additionally to storing data in non-standard formats, some games also utilize runtime protection through software protectors. The key target is to keep attackers from directly inspecting or modifying compiled software. Protectors utilize either of three methods to protect software. Encryption solutions will encrypt the code instructions and typically use a multi‚Äìlayered defense mechanism against any reversing or tampering attempts that target the decryption code directly. Most protection systems in this category encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application's startup or during runtime. This is the moment at which an attacker will breakpoint, reverse, and inject custom code. Runtime decryption may also add significant processing overhead and lower the game's framerate. Alternatively, some solutions focus on obfuscating the code by inserting jump statements and seemingly random instruction paths. The final and strongest alternative is virtualization. In this approach the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that can be markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set can be unique for each protected file. The shared weakness of protectors and virtualizers is that they impact performance, either by requiring decryption or by introducing unnecessary CPU instructions. To reduce the overhead code virtualizers are often only used to secure the critical parts of the code base, such as those interfacing with the gamestate and rendering. =Player supervision= Spectator functionality can allow server administrators to monitor individual players and thereby determine whether or not a cheat is in place. One risk of the spectator mode is that in competitive matches the spectator could abuse the mode for spying on specific players and communicating player positions and tactics to the opposing team. Some games get around this limitation by not allowing spectator mode at all, or by delaying the video feed. Some games have systemized player supervision by allowing the community to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. Reports can include data such as screenshots, videos, and chatlogs. =Statistical detection= Anomalies in player behavior can be detected by statistically analyzing game events sent by the client to the server. The great benefit is that this anti‚Äìcheat method is non‚Äìintrusive to the player's privacy and guaranteed to work on all end‚Äìuser system configurations. The restriction of this method is that it cannot always be clear whether or not a player is cheating. Highly skilled players can for example develop such a map sense that they may end up being flagged for the use of a wallhack and/or aimbot. On the other hand, players may also cheat in a way that is under the detection thresholds and remain uncaught. To reduce the amount of false positives, statistical detection systems are often combined with a supervision system that either is community driven or managed by a professional administrator team. In such implementations unusual player behavior can trigger a clientside component to create and upload reports for review. =Pattern detection= Pattern detection systems scan the player's hard drives and system memory for known cheat code or programs. Compared to statistical detection the key advantage is that also the subtle cheaters are detected. Other than this, a pure pattern detection approach generally has few advantages. Experience has shown that keeping detection based systems up to date is relatively slow and labor-intensive as one needs to constantly track down cheats and update detection patterns. End‚Äìusers may also be concerned with privacy issues, such as has been the case with VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) accessing browsing history. =Sandboxing= Sandboxing a software process can protect against potentially malicious actions such as code injection and memory modifications that would otherwise tamper with the game. One of the key benefits of sandboxing is that it can effectively prevent the underlying cheat mechanisms from working, and thereby can avoid the need for banning game community members as cheats simply don't work. Additionally, strong prevention mechanisms can stop many game hackers from targeting the game because of elevated skill requirements. Compared to pattern detection systems, sandboxing is generally not privacy invasive as the approach requires no data to be uploaded to foreign back-end systems. Ramifications Game publishers can implement a wide array of consequences for cheating players. =Banning players= Some companies and leagues ban suspected cheaters by blacklisting specific installation or serial keys, or user accounts, meaning that the player is effectively prevented from playing the game online. Some game publishers may decide to try and permanently ban players who are persistent in cheating and ruining the game community. Such bans are typically placed based on hardware ID or IP address. Consequently, cheaters may develop ways of getting around these bans, by either playing through proxy or VPN servers, or spoofing or changing their hardware configuration. While game publishers are known to ban players employing cheats, the actual number of players banned is usually not revealed. Exceptions to this include Blizzard Entertainment, Nexon, and CipSoft, known for banning cheaters in batches, and publicising the number of banned accounts, presumably in order to discourage others from cheating. Shadow banning Some games identify cheaters and place them in matchmaking with other cheaters only, so as not to let the cheaters know that they have been identified. =Suspension= In some cases a ban may not be permanent and expire after a certain period of time. This approach is commonly used as a ramification for the abuse of game glitches, harassing players, or benefiting from hackers. Temporary bans may also be utilized in case a violation cannot be fully proven, as is common with anti-cheating methods based on supervision or statistical detection. =In-game kick= In general kicking is perceived as a mild ramification, serving as a warning rather than a punishment for the player in question. Some anti-cheat systems may decide to kick players out of a game server when the system integrity cannot be enforced nor be determined with certainty. Other anti-cheat methods may also utilize kicks as an instant punishment for presumably unfair game play behavior. Some games may also provide the community with the option of voting for particular players to be kicked. Such a system provides the power to self regulate and effectively get rid of abusive players without depending on supervision or other anti-cheat methods. Even though vote kicking brings many benefits, it may also serve as a tool for trolling or griefing by allowing for legitimate players to be removed out of the game through the voting process. =Demotion= When a violation is the result of farming or stat-padding, it may be too severe of a punishment to suspend or ban players. Some games, therefore, implement a system of demotion in which the offender is moved to a lower rank (demoting), the opposite of a promotion. =Progress- removal= In several games where points are used, if a player is caught cheating they will get their score reset to the base value that is applied when a new player joins the server. Legal measures In recent cases, countries such as South Korea have begun to legislate criminal sanctions for use of cheats in online games. The presence of cheaters in online games hurts sales and ultimately reduces the overall value of the industry. This rationale is being pushed forward to pass laws that help enforce socially acceptable conduct and thereby minimize undue losses to developers. Cheating thus negatively affect both developers and users alike, as unfair exploitation which ultimately lowers the value of both purchase and product. Thereby warranting action as to protect the whole of the industry. Criticism of this policy shifts the responsibility of anti-cheat policing to developers themselves. However, the Indie sector is especially vulnerable and often has limited resources with which to combat the trend. Historically, some game companies have also filed suit against individuals or commercial entities that have created and sold cheating tools in video games as a means to curb their use. In April 2013, coder DrUnKeN ChEeTaH was sued by Nexon America for operating GameAnarchy, a popular subscription based cheat provider for Combat Arms, and lost, Nexon being awarded $1.4M in damages. In January 2017, Riot Games successfully sued the LeagueSharp service, which offered a subscription- based hacking service for Riot's League of Legends, with a $10 million award to be paid to Riot. Blizzard Entertainment sued Bossland GMBH for distributing software hacks for several of its games, and was awarded $8.5 million in damages.

He has been called \\"the father of German science fiction\\".\\"German SF\\" by Franz Rottensteiner, in: Neil Barron ed, Anatomy of Wonder. Third Edition. New York: Bowker, 1987. pp.379‚Äì404. He sometimes used the pseudonym Velatus.  Biography  Lasswitz studied mathematics and physics at the University of Breslau and the University of Berlin, and earned his doctorate in 1873. He spent most of his career as a teacher at the Ernestine Gymnasium in Gotha (1876‚Äì1908).  Works  His first published science fiction story was Bis zum Nullpunkt des Seins (\\"To the Zero Point of Existence\\", 1871), depicting life in 2371, but he earned his reputation with his 1897 novel Auf zwei Planeten, which describes an encounter between humans and a Martian civilization that is older and more advanced. The book has the Martian race running out of water, eating synthetic foods, travelling by rolling roads, and utilising space stations. His spaceships use anti-gravity, but travel realistic orbital trajectories, and use occasional mid-course corrections in travelling between Mars and the Earth; the book depicted the technically correct transit between the orbits of two planets, something poorly understood by other early science fiction writers. It influenced Walter Hohmann and Wernher von Braun. The book was not translated into English until 1971 (as Two Planets), and the translation is incomplete. Auf zwei Planeten was his most successful novel. A story from Lasswitz's Traumkristalle served as the basis for \\"The Library of Babel\\", a short story by Jorge Luis Borges.Borges, Jorge Luis, and Eliot Weinberger. \\"The Total Library\\" in Selected Non-Fictions. New York: Penguin Books, 1999, pp.215‚Äì216. His last book was Sternentau: die Pflanze vom Neptunsmond (\\"Star Dew: the Plant of Neptune's Moon\\", 1909). He is also known for his 1896 biography of Gustav Fechner. For his writing (totalling around 420 works including non-fiction), Lasswitz has been called \\"the first utopistic-scientific writer in Germany\\" or even \\"a German Jules Verne\\". A crater on Mars was named in his honour, as was the asteroid 46514 Lasswitz.

The tradition in the Major League Baseball mascot began with Mr. Met, introduced for the New York Mets when Shea Stadium opened in 1964. Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity of mascots increased when The San Diego Chicken started independently making appearances at San Diego Padres games in 1977. Philadelphia Phillies management felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the Phillie Phanatic in 1978. Today, all but three major-league teams have \\"official\\" mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels). Six team mascots ‚Äì Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals), the San Diego Chicken, the Phillie Phanatic, Mr. Met, the Oriole Bird, and Slider (Cleveland Indians) ‚Äì have been inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Several others have been nominated since the Hall's creation in 2005. Mascots in the MLB are often used to help market the team and league to young children.  Current mascots  = Ace (Toronto Blue Jays) = Ace, the Toronto Blue Jays mascot Ace is the official mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays. He, along with his female counterpart, \\"Diamond\\" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large blue jay. The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the \\"ace\\" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay). In 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below). = Barrelman (Milwaukee Brewers) = Barrelman, the Milwaukee Brewers mascot. Barrelman (aka \\"Owgust\\" and \\"Beer Barrel Man\\"), is an auxiliary mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. He was resurrected and upgraded to be a costumed performing character in 2015, having previously only been an official logo image and since 1977 only appearing on special materials. = Baxter the Bobcat (Arizona Diamondbacks) = Baxter the Bobcat is the mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks. His full name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000. The mascot was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder in the Cincinnati Reds minor league system), the son of Jay Bell, one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. \\"D. Baxter\\" comes from the team's nickname, \\"the D-Backs\\". The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play. Today called Chase Field, it was once called Bank One Ballpark, or \\"BOB\\" for short. The bobcat is a wild cat native to Arizona. = Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers) = Miller Park Bernie Brewer is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. The Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache. A beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths. Bernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers at Milwaukee County Stadium, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of the Lakefront Brewery, Inc. tour. In 2001, Bernie moved to Miller Park, and today the old chalet has become known as \\"Bernie's Dugout\\", stationed above the left field bleachers, where he cheers on for the team during home games. Currently he slides down a plastic yellow slide, no longer into a vat of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker's trademark home run call (\\"Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!\\") lights up above the Dugout, and he waves the team flag after landing in the bottom platform. = Billy The Marlin (Miami Marlins) = Billy the Marlin Billy The Marlin is the official mascot of the Miami Marlins. Resembling a marlin with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, during each game. The name, picked by original team owner Wayne Huizenga, is derived from the fact that a marlin is a billfish, and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone. On Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into Hard Rock Stadium (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy's parachute entrance. When he didn't arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's nightly quote, \\"Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!\\" The original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993‚Äì2002) entertaining Marlins fans. Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983 to 1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. = Blooper (Atlanta Braves) = Since opening day 2018, Blooper is the mascot of the Atlanta Braves. = Clark (Chicago Cubs) = Clark with the Oriole Bird On January 13, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that Clark, a \\"young, friendly Cub\\", would become the team's first official mascot in modern history. Clark was named after Clark Street, since the Cubs home field, Wrigley Field, is famously located at \\"Clark and Addison\\". = D-backs Luchador (Arizona Diamondbacks) = The D-backs Luchador is the second mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a giveaway of masks in June 2012 proved popular, the team introduced the Luchador as a permanent character in July 2013. He wears a black cape, red pants, and a mask patterned after the team's logo. Meant to represent the team's Hispanic fans, the Luchador also wrestles with Club Deportivo Coloseo at the Glendale Park and Swap. = Dinger (Colorado Rockies) = Dinger at Coors Field Dinger is the official mascot of the Colorado Rockies. He is an anthropomorphic purple triceratops. The choice of a dinosaur, specifically this type, was inspired by the discovery of a number of dinosaur fossils‚Äîmost notably a , triceratops skull‚Äîat Coors Field during its construction. His name \\"Dinger\\" is one of many slang terms for a home run. Dinger is often seen on the field before and after the game and roaming around the stadium during the game. When Rockies hitters are at bat in the late innings of a game, he often dances in the seats immediately behind home plate in an effort to distract opposing pitchers, sitting down only immediately before the beginning motion of each pitch. Dinger has been the Colorado Rockies biggest fan since he first hatched from his egg at Mile High Stadium on April 16, 1994.http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/col/ballpark/ballpark_guide.jsp Dinger works year-round promoting physical fitness and literacy for thousands of elementary school students in the Rocky Mountain Region. He acts out his own Dinger Story for the kids. He also makes appearances at Children's Hospital Colorado and Denver Health. He makes appearances at Rockies events including the 5K Home Run, and the Rockies Rookies Kids Fan Club.http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/col/fan_forum/mascot_appearance.jsp He is a purple dinosaur with a Rockies jersey on with black sneakers. = DJ Kitty (Tampa Bay Rays) = DJ Kitty is the new mascot for the Tampa Bay Rays. DJ Kitty comes from the Internet sensation of a kitty playing a DJ System and dancing to the music. The cat wears a Tampa Bay Rays ring, wears chains, and wears his Rays hat backwards. As of 2013, DJ Kitty is the new secondary mascot for the Rays along with Raymond. = Fredbird (St. Louis Cardinals) = Fredbird entertaining the crowd between innings during a Cardinals game at Busch Stadium Fredbird is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform. A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from \\"Redbird\\", a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves. Fredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of \\"beaking\\" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by \\"Team Fredbird\\", a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties. He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area. = Gapper (Cincinnati Reds) = Gapper in 2005 signing a Gapper doll for a fan :See also: #Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds) and #Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds) Gapper is one of the current mascots for the Cincinnati Reds. He was first introduced as the furry companion to Mr. Red, the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, Great American Ball Park. The mascot was created by David Raymond's Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the \\"gap\\" in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium. The term \\"gapper\\" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the \\"gap\\" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence).

Although his name (a play on the name \\"Lucille\\") is a bit ambiguous, he is indeed \\"officially\\" male and the person inside the costume is a man.Pullen, Suzanne. \\"Seal of approval: Mascot Lou Seal has become a true Giant in his field. The kids love him, the players love him and even the man inside the sweat-soaked costume loves him,\\" San Francisco Chronicle (September 21, 2003). Lou Seal is also a reference to the San Francisco Seals, the baseball club that was a mainstay of the Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957. In a contest held by the Giants where fans were asked for ideas, six people submitted the name \\"Lou Seal.\\" These lucky fans were then invited to a game that season where they sat in a luxury box and got to meet the newly named mascot, and one of them was randomly chosen to throw out the first pitch. In 2008 Forbes Magazine named Lou Seal the best mascot in sports. He has had 1,150 consecutive home-game appearances, and is one of the four subjects followed in the second season of the Hulu series Behind the Mask. He wears the team's main or orange alternate jersey at home games with the team cap, whenever Brandon Belt plays he sometimes wears a giraffe hat with the uniform (in honor of his nickname \\"Baby Giraffe\\").

During the 1995 American League Division Series between the M's and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to T-Mobile Park and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around T-Mobile Park's warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers. The Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007. He also nearly ran over Coco Crisp with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell. = Mr. Met (New York Mets) = Mr. and Mrs. Met Mr. Met is the official mascot of the New York Mets. He is a baseball-headed humanoid being who wears a Mets cap and uniform. He can be seen at Citi Field (and previously at Shea Stadium) during Mets home games. He also has appeared in several commercials as part of ESPN's This is SportsCenter campaign, and was selected in 2007 into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Starting in 2014, Mr. Met appeared as a sleeve patch on the Mets' blue alternate home and road jerseys. = Mrs. Met (New York Mets) = Mrs. Met (or Lady Met) is the female version of Mr. Met, the mascot of the New York Mets. She is a baseball-headed humanoid being, has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a Mets cap and uniform. Mrs. Met first appeared at games in 1975 before disappearing into obscurity.

The patch featured Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform and \\"Mr. Red\\" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt. A human version of the mascot didn't appear until the early 1980s. The costumed mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs to take his place. A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie Red. = Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds) = :See also: #Gapper (Cincinnati) and #Rosie Red (Cincinnati) Mr. Redlegs is a mascot of the Cincinnati Reds. He was reintroduced in 2007 to play a supporting role, along with Mr. Red. Mr. Redlegs appeared as a patch on the Reds' uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the second red scare). In 2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an ATV during pre-game antics. This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a neck brace as a joke. = Orbit (Houston Astros) = Orbit Orbit is the mascot of the Houston Astros. Orbit represents a green space alien with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston. Originally serving as team mascot from 1990 until 1999, he was replaced by a new mascot, Junction Jack.

The Oriole Bird was named to the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2020. = Paws (Detroit Tigers) = Paws is the mascot of the Detroit Tigers. He is a tiger who made his debut on May 5, 1995, in Tiger Stadium. He wears a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired No. 11 and No. 16 in honor of Sparky Anderson and Hal Newhouser, respectively. His dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a Santa Claus outfit during \\"Christmas in July\\" night, or an Elvis Presley-inspired costume for Elvis Night. He \\"resides\\" in Comerica Park to this day. = Phillie Phanatic (Philadelphia Phillies) = The Phillie Phanatic, arguably the most recognizable mascot in all of North American sports. Phillie Phanatic is the official mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to The San Diego Chicken. The character is named for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to current owner and former team vice president, Bill Giles, was to bring more families to Veterans Stadium, the Phillies' ballpark at the time, which had become noted for rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an ATV at home games. In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the second best mascot in sports, behind San Francisco's Lou Seal. = The Pierogis (Pittsburgh Pirates) = The Pierogis are a series of seven people dressed in pierogi costumes that race in a promotion between innings during Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games. The contestants in this race include: Jalape√±o Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange), Potato Pete (blue), and Pizza Penny (Red and White checkered). The Great Pierogi Race was inspired by the Milwaukee Brewers' Sausage Race. = Pirate Parrot (Pittsburgh Pirates) = The Pirate Parrot is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979. He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named \\"Captain Flint\\". He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting hot-dogs from a cannon, during team home wins he can be seen celebrating waving a Jolly Roger flag. = The Racing presidents (Washington Nationals) = The Washington Nationals have a President's Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on Mount Rushmore ‚Äì George Washington (\\"George\\"), Thomas Jefferson (\\"Tom\\"), Abraham Lincoln (\\"Abe\\"), and Theodore Roosevelt (\\"Teddy\\") ‚Äì have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant ‚Äì William Howard Taft (\\"Bill\\") ‚Äì was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. Calvin Coolidge (\\"Cal\\") was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. Herbert Hoover (\\"Herbie\\") replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place in the order in which they held the office (George ‚Äì 1; Tom ‚Äì 3; Abe ‚Äì 16; Teddy ‚Äì 26; William ‚Äì 27; Cal ‚Äì 30; Herbie ‚Äì 31). The Racing presidents became an instant success upon their 2006 debut and make multiple public appearances every year. Notably, Abraham Lincoln appeared on the Illinois float for President Barack Obama's first inauguration parade on January 20, 2009. A running gag with the Racing presidents from 2006 to 2012 was that Teddy could never win a race, although he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other three presidents: While he was \\"Tebowing\\" near the finish line, George drove up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat, knocking him out before he could finish the race. In October 2012, however, just before the regular season ended and shortly before the Nationals' first postseason run began, Teddy finally won his first race, and he then went on to win four straight. The Nationals scrapped plans to replace Herbie in 2017 with the president to be featured on that year's White House Historical Association Christmas ornament. Instead, they announced before the 2017 season that Bill, Cal, and Herbie all had retired to Florida, where in 2017 they began a new series of presidents Races among themselves during Nationals spring training games at FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach. Meanwhile, the presidents Race at Nationals Park returned in 2017 to its original format of 2006‚Äì2012, featuring only George, Tom, Abe, and Teddy. = Rally Squirrel (St. Louis Cardinals) = Rally Squirrel is a secondary mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic squirrel wearing the team's uniform with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at Busch Stadium during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 2011 National League Division Series. The squirrel ran across home plate as Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker, causing Oswalt to complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon. A performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies beginning with Game 3 of the 2011 National League Championship Series, and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot Fredbird during the remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium. = Rangers Captain (Texas Rangers) = Rangers Captain is the mascot of the Texas Rangers. Rangers Captain is the mascot for the Texas Rangers. Introduced in 2002, he is a palomino-style horse, dressed in the team's uniform. He wears the uniform number \\"72\\" in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Rangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like Elvis Presley as part of an Elvis theme promotional night. = Raymond (Tampa Bay Rays) = Raymond, the Tampa Bay Rays mascot in September 2007 Raymond is the mascot of the Tampa Bay Rays. Raymond is a furry blue creature wearing a large pair of sneakers and a backward baseball cap, completed with a Rays jersey.

Raymond was awarded an honorable mention in the GameOps.com Best Mascot contest for 2006. = Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds) = :See also: and Rosie Red is the female mascot of the Cincinnati Reds. She was introduced in August 2008 as the new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of \\"Rooters Organized to Stimulate Interest and Enthuiasm in the Cincinnati Reds.\\" = The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers) = The sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s the Hot Dog became a racer. In 2006 a fifth sausage was debuted, The Spanish Chorizo. They are a favorite of fans and make sports highlights reels occasionally. = Screech (Washington Nationals) = Screech is the mascot of the Washington Nationals. He is a bald eagle who wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was \\"hatched\\" on April 17, 2005 at the \\"Kids Opening Day\\" promotion at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining that it was \\"strong and eats almost everything.\\" A new \\"matured\\" edition of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The Springfield Falcons, which played in the American Hockey League until they moved to Tucson in 2016, also had a mascot named Screech. = Slider (Cleveland Indians) = Slider Slider is the mascot for the Cleveland Indians. He is a large, furry fuchsia-colored creature. He has a large yellow nose and shaggy yellow eyebrows. He was created in 1990, inspired by the Phillie Phanatic.

He was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008. = Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals) = Sluggerrr is the mascot of the Kansas City Royals Sluggerrr is the official mascot of the Kansas City Royals. The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 5, 1996. The word slugger also refers to a powerful batter with a high percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage. In 2009, a spectator was injured by a hot dog thrown into the stands by Sluggerrr as part of a between-innings promotion. The spectator sued the Royals organization, claiming that they had been negligent. A jury found for the team under the Baseball Rule, which limits spectators' ability to sue teams for injuries arising from gameplay, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that a mascot's hot dog toss is not an essential part of baseball. On retrial, a new jury found that neither the team nor the fan were at fault, and awarded no damages. In 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame. = Southpaw (Chicago White Sox) = Southpaw, the mascot of the Chicago White Sox Southpaw is the mascot of the Chicago White Sox. His name is a reference to a left-hand pitcher and is also a reference to Chicago's South Side, where the team plays. He was on a float for Illinois at Barack Obama's inauguration, along with the Washington Nationals racing president representation of Abraham Lincoln. = Stomper (Oakland Athletics) = Stomper is the mascot of the Oakland Athletics. Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several All-Star Games and has appeared in a Public Service Announcement discouraging the use of chewing tobacco. The use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by industrialist Benjamin Shibe, became the team's first owners. When asked to comment, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the rival National League, said something to the effect that \\"Shibe had bought himself a white elephant.\\" In response, A's manager (and future owner) Connie Mack selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an illustration of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics uniform, including from 1988 to the present. = Swinging Friar (San Diego Padres) = The Swinging Friar is the mascot for the San Diego Padres. The Swinging Friar is the mascot of the San Diego Padres. The Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a minor league baseball organization. He was named after the Spanish Franciscan friars, who founded the Mission San Diego de Alcal√°, around which the city of San Diego began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined Major League Baseball in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team emblem until 1984. Wanting a more \\"professional\\" image, the owners introduced a more corporate logo. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day. The Swinging Friar is a cartoon-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. He is dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be ambidextrous, or even a switch hitter. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special camouflage cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms. The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win. Originally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume. Some in the past have confused The San Diego Chicken as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team. As of 2019, the Friar is also active with his own Twitter account, which debuted just days after the team's decision to readopt the classic brown and gold uniform colors for 2020 and beyond. = T. C. Bear (Minnesota Twins) = T.C. Bear, the mascot of the Minnesota Twins T. C. is the mascot for the Minnesota Twins. He was first introduced to Minnesota on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled after the Hamm's Beer Bear, a mascot used in advertisements for Hamm's Brewery, an early sponsor for the Twins. The \\"T. C.\\" stands for the \\"Twin Cities\\", Minneapolis and St. Paul. Prior to T.C., the mascot for the Minnesota Twins 1980‚Äì81 was a loon named \\"Twinkie\\". T.C. can be seen wearing the team home main or alternate uniform with the TC mark on his cap, just like the rest of the team. = Wally the Green Monster and Tessie (Boston Red Sox) = Wally the Green Monster Wally the Green Monster is the official mascot for the Boston Red Sox. His name is derived from the Green Monster nickname of the wall in left field at Fenway Park. Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children. According to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it \\"eats up\\" hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a hermit for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since. When the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well. In January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named Tessie, Wally the Green Monster's little sister. Tessie is named after the song \\"Tessie\\", which has long been associated with the Red Sox.Slane, Kevin (January 5, 2016). \\"Wally the Green Monster's Little sister, Tessie, Is Shipping Up to Boston\\", Boston Globe. Retrieved August 13, 2016.  Former mascots  This is a list of former Major League Baseball mascots. Some of these mascots may still be used, but are not considered \\"official\\" mascots. = Astrojack and Astrodillo = Astrojack, an anthropomorphic rabbit, and Astrodillo, an anthropomorphic armadillo, were mascots for the Houston Astros in the 1980s. They wore the Astros' \\"rainbow\\" uniforms of that time, and were also the team's first mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks between innings, they would also race around the field on three- wheelers and perform skits with the Astrodome's house band, The Astronuts. The creator of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later Astros mascot, Junction Jack. = BJ Birdy = BJ Birdy served as the official mascot for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999. He was ejected from a game in 1993 for \\"showing up\\" the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found offensive.McKean an athlete behind plate SLAM! SportsAnrde Dawson Leads Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame; James McKean, N.E. Peter Hardy & Joseph John Lannin Also Named Canadian Baseball News He was replaced in 1999 with Ace and Diamond. BJ was created and played by the same person, Kevin Shanahan, for his entire 20-year career as the Jays' mascot. Shanahan lost 3 toes on his left foot in an automobile accident during the 1991 off season, but managed to return as the Jays mascot, missing only the first home game of the season. = Bluepper = Bluepper was a former mascot for the San Diego Padres from 1992 to 1994, He was a dark blue dog-like character with a baseball nose and a sun visor, he was later retired in 1994 because of his unpopularity. = Bonnie Brewer = Bonnie Brewer is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases. Bonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig. Bonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek. Bonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her \\"firing\\". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18‚Äì28, 2000. , Bonnie is part of the Brewers' \\"Retro Fridays\\" promotions at Miller Park, incorporating the traditional base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie's Dugout during the fans' singing of the \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\" in the seventh inning stretch. = Braves Bleacher Creature = The Braves Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured green shaggy fur with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended more for the entertainment of younger fans. The mascot was costumed by Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5\\"8\\" to 5'10\\" tall, and Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one of his costume's eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades. Stensland was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really \\"funky smell\\" permeated the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years. = Charlie-O = Charlie-O the Mule was the mascot used by the Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A's from 1963 to 1976. The mule was named after their colorful owner at that time, Charles O. Finley. When the A's moved to then heavily Democratic Missouri, where the official state animal is the mule, Warren Hearnes gave a mule to Finley for his barnyard menagerie at Municipal Stadium which also include sheep and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field. The Municipal Stadium menagerie also included Warpaint, the horse mascot of the Kansas City Chiefs. As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A's logo and changed the A's colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and white. Finley took the sorrel mule around the country, walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters. = Chester Charge = In April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \\"Charge!\\" The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson. = Chief Noc-A-Homa = Chief Noc-A-Homa was the original mascot of the Atlanta Braves from the 1950s until 1986. The name was used for the \\"laughing Indian\\" sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. From at least the early 1960s, while still in Milwaukee County Stadium, until the early 1980s at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, this mascot \\"lived\\" in a teepee in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats. The teepee was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove the chief's home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee was returned to its spot and the team won the division. Opposition to Native American mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually replace him with Homer The Brave. = Crazy Crab = The Crazy Crab was a mascot of the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy Crab was meant as an \\"anti-mascot\\", satirizing on the mascot craze that was going on at the time. Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot (played by actor Wayne Doba) and manager Frank Robinson appeared in a commercial with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him. This encouragement may have worked too well, as Giants fans regularly threw various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, and Crazy Crab's suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for protection. The crab was so hated, players on both the Giants and even the opposition would throw rosin bags and other objects at the mascot. Doba sued the San Diego Padres after two of their players (Kurt Bevacqua and Bruce Bochy) tackled him, causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. The crab returned for the last game at Candlestick Park that the Giants played in 1999, and a bobblehead was given away with its likeness on July 18, 2008 as the franchise celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in the Bay Area. There is even a website devoted to bringing back the Crazy Crab called Rehab The CrabBring Back the Crazy Crab www.rehabthecrab.com (Petition site) and now a Crazy Crab sandwich at AT&T; Park. In 2014, Colin Hanks directed The Anti- Mascot, an ESPN 30 for 30 short about Crazy Crab.30 for 30 Shorts: The Anti- Mascot ESPN On July 7, 2018, Crazy Crab made an appearance at AT&T; Park in honor of the Giants' Crazy Crab scarf giveaway. = Dandy = Dandy was a short-lived mascot of the New York Yankees. He was a large pinstriped bird- like mascot that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher Sparky Lyle. His name was a play on the classic American folk song \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\". He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular that he was quickly canceled. Dandy was beaten up by fans who didn't want a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the Yankees chose not to replace him. Along with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field, although the late Freddy Schuman has served as an unofficial promoter in the stands for decades, and a squirrel appearing on the field has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team. = Diamond = Diamond was a secondary mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays alongside Ace. She and Ace replaced BJ Birdy in 2000. However, she was dropped at the end of the 2003 season, leaving Ace the sole mascot of the team. = General Admission = General Admission (a pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the Astrodome) was a mascot for the Houston Astros in the mid-to-late 1990s. He was played by Michael Kenny, who is now the Senior Director of Guest Relations for the Houston Astros, and wore a traditional U.S. Cavalry uniform complete with gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit in the dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run, General Admission would fire a cannon from his outfield platform (that would often scare those seated near him). He was \\"killed off\\" at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate game of the regular season. = Homer = Homer was the mascot of the Atlanta Braves. He had a baseball shaped head, and looked a little like Mr. Met. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification of the old \\"Screaming Warrior\\" logo the Braves used before dropping it in 1988. Homer's full name was Homer the Brave. This was meant to sound like \\"home of the brave\\", the last words of the national anthem. Incidentally, \\"homer\\" was also the longtime nickname for a home run. = Junction Jack = Junction Jack was the mascot character for the Houston Astros from 2000 until 2012. He was a rabbit dressed as a railroad engineer. His \\"relatives\\" were Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the Astros. Junction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the Astrodome to Minute Maid Park. The new stadium was originally called \\"The Ballpark at Union Station\\" because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston. In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer. The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees. After the 2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012. Orbit's return coincided with the Astros' move to the American League West as well as their new uniforms, caps, and logo. = Larry = Larry, a Bull Terrier, was the mascot for the Cleveland Naps in the 1910s, cared for by player Jack Graney.Ulrey, Adam. \\"Jack Graney\\". SABR Baseball Biography Project. Retrieved 16 May 2012. = Lefty and Righty (Boston Red Sox) = Before their retirement in 2014, Lefty and Righty were each a large, red sock with arms, and before Tessie the Green Monster's introduction in 2016, were the alternate mascot characters for the Boston Red Sox through the 2014 MLB season, joining Wally the Green Monster. They were seen on large outings with Wally such as the 2007 World Series Parade as well as weekend afternoon games at Fenway Park. = Mettle the Mule = Mettle the Mule was a mascot of the New York Mets for a short time starting in 1976. Originally named Arthur, Mettle was renamed as a result of a fan contest. Mettle was kept in a pen near the Mets' bullpen in the right field of Shea Stadium. = Mr. Oriole = Mr. Oriole was the original Baltimore Orioles mascot in 1954. Commissioned by Orioles Public Relations Director Dick Armstrong to \\"replicate the expression and appearance of Mr. Oriole\\" designed by Baltimore Sun cartoonist Jim Hartzell, a costumed mascot was created \\"so that a three- dimension version of the bird could cavort on the field and in the stands during the games.\\" Mr. Oriole holds the distinction of being the first costumed mascot in Major League Baseball. = Philadelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis = Philadelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis served as mascots for the Phillies during the 1970s (1971‚Äì79). Their costumes invoked the city's revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair reappeared with their replacement‚Äîthe Phanatic‚Äîas the Phillies celebrated their final year at Veterans Stadium in 2003, including the final opening day and final game. = Rally = Rally was one of the Atlanta Braves mascots. He was a Red and Blue Muppet-like mascot with a Blue Mowhawk, he first appeared during the 1985-1986 season and became a fan favorite, he would often hang out with Homer during games, later on he gained a baseball nose sometime in the early 2000s, but then he suddenly disappeared sometime during the 2004-2005 season, leaving Homer the only mascot until Blooper Arrived in 2018. = Ribbie and Roobarb = Ribbie and Roobarb were a pair of mascots used by the Chicago White Sox from 1981 to 1988 at Comiskey Park. After the Sox were sold in 1981 by Bill Veeck to an ownership group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, the new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox. They debuted the pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the team‚Äîboth because of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate Andy the Clown, who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. \\"Rhubarb\\" is longtime baseball slang for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes from the acronym RBI, for runs batted in. Often reports will say ribbie instead of RBI to describe it. After another failed mascot in the early 1990s was Waldo the White Sox Wolf. The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2003. = Ribbie and Southpaw = Ribbie and Southpaw were a pair of bear mascots created by the Los Angeles Angels in 1993, but they were replaced by Scoop and Clutch in the mid 1990s = Schottzie = Schottzie was a live St. Bernard mascot used by the Cincinnati Reds from 1982 until his death in 1991, he was later replaced by another St. Bernard named Schottzie (02), who was mascot from 1992 until 1999. = Scoop and Clutch = Scoop and Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 2002 season. = Souki = Souki was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, for only one season (1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. Met, but with one difference. The Expos' Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a loss). = The Baseball Bug = The Baseball Bug was the former mascot of the Cleveland Indians from 1980 to 1981. He was a large red creature with a long nose and a baseball cap with eyes and antennas sticking out. He was retired after the 1981 season. = Trunk = Trunk was the former mascot of the Oakland Athletics from 1993 to 1996. he was an elephant similar to Stomper, but was skinnier and wore black sunglasses similar to the alternate logo used from 1994 to 2002. he was replaced by Stomper later on in the 1997 season. = Twinkie the Loon = Twinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 1981. = Youppi! = Youppi! was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, before the franchise moved to Washington as the Washington Nationals. He is an orange furry creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by Bonnie Erickson, formerly a designer for some of Jim Henson's Muppets characters. Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase Yippee! or Hooray! in French. Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors' dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned as a mascot after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but was adopted by the NHL's Montreal Canadiens team on September 16, 2005, as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from one sport to another, while remaining in the same city. Youppi! was voted to the Mascot Hall of Fame in December 2019, and will be inducted in June 2020. Youppi! is the first mascot of a Canadian team to receive the honor.  Teams without a mascot  The following MLB teams do not currently have an official mascot: * New York Yankees * Los Angeles Dodgers * Los Angeles Angels  Mascot store in various ballparks  The \\"Build-A-Bear Workshop\\" Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store, at Citizens Bank Park, was the first store of its kind in sports. Fans are invited to buy and stuff a Phillie Phanatic doll and dress it up. Following the 2010 season, the Build-A- Bear in Philadelphia was discontinued. Similar shops have since been set up in Cincinnati (Great American Ball Park), Cleveland (Progressive Field), St. Louis (Busch Stadium), San Francisco (Oracle Park), and Washington, D.C. (Nationals Park). The Milwaukee Brewers also have in their main team store at Miller Park a whole section of their store consisting entirely of merchandise featuring the Racing Sausages, called The Meat Locker.

The headwater tributaries of the Piney River rise in Dickson County, Tennessee, near the city of Dickson. Dickson is located on the \\"Tennessee Valley Divide\\", which corresponds for some distance with the downtown's Main Street. The western part of the town, the part in the Tennessee Valley (as opposed to the Cumberland Valley), is drained by the East Piney River, a tributary to the Piney. The city lakes, formerly a water supply source and the site of an early electrical power plant even before this, are on a Piney River tributary, as was a former city sewer plant, which was closed when a larger water intake was built further down on the Piney. The upper reaches of the Piney were inadequate for the area's needs, and a pipeline to the Cumberland River in the north end of the county has now been completed, relieving the Piney of the burden of supplying the water needs to a growing community that threatened soon to exhaust it. The West and East Piney rivers flow together near the community of Mount Sinai; this confluence marks the true head of the stream. The stream flows from this point south-southeast into Hickman County, where it meets the waters of the Duck River a few miles west- northwest of Centerville.

Several wildlife preserves are incorporated within the Boise Greenbelt The Boise River Greenbelt is a recreational and alternate transportation trail along the banks of the Boise River through Boise, Idaho, United States. The Boise Greenbelt is more of a greenway than a green belt since its character is linear. It extends more than 20 miles (32 km) beginning at Lucky Peak Dam in the east to a short distance beyond Eagle Road (Idaho State Highway 55) in the west in Eagle, Idaho. Taking into account both sides of the river and other parallel trails and spurs, the total Greenbelt trail system measures more than 30 miles (48 km). The Greenbelt connects Boise's riverside parks and connects Boise with neighboring municipalities. The majority of the Greenbelt is paved with asphalt or concrete on both sides of the river. However some sections are unpaved and bicycles may be prohibited on some unpaved sections. Where this occurs, bicycles have alternate routes on residential streets or dedicated bike paths. Motorized vehicles are prohibited on all parts of the Greenbelt. Segways are allowed on the Greenbelt in the City of Boise providing a special permit has been obtained. History In 1962, the City of Boise hired a consultant, Atkinson & Associates, to create Boise's first comprehensive plan. The plan suggested the city should acquire land along the Boise River to create a continuous \\"green belt\\" of public lands stretching the entire length of the community. A local grassroots effort to clean up the waterway and create public access to the river corridor began to take hold. This vision caught on, and by 1967 three small parcels of land were donated to the city to launch the \\"green belt.\\" In 1968, with public interest and support growing, the first Greenbelt Plan and Guidelines were adopted by the Board of Parks Commissioners. A Greenbelt and Pathways Committee was appointed in 1969 to guide the City of Boise as it worked to develop the Greenbelt, and in 1971 the first Greenbelt Ordinance was adopted which required a minimum setback of for all structures and parking areas. The City of Boise continued to slowly piece together a patchwork of land along the corridor using several methods of acquisition including purchase, exchange, leasing and receiving donations of property by individuals, civic groups and corporations.

Also on the north bank, approximately 1/4 mile west of Glenwood Bridge the greenbelt becomes a bicycle dismount zone at the Riverside Village residential development. The bicycle dismount zone continues approximately westward. As of April 2008 Garden City has made it a misdemeanor to ride a bicycle on the greenbelt through Riverside Village. However, there is a roughly parallel signed bicycle route which allows bicyclists to continue westward on residential streets to the City of Eagle greenbelt without having to ride on busy State Street (State Highway 44). =South Bank, from east to west= Baybrook Court Pedestrian Bridge, SE 2.1, in Boise The 36th Ave. Pedestrian Bridge, SW 2.0, connects Garden City with Boise * Barber Park * Bown Crossing, A New Urbanism style district * Parkcenter Blvd. residential area * Baybrook Court Footbridge * Boise State University * Ann Morrison Park * Kathryn Albertson Park * Joe's Crab Shack Restaurant * Riverside Hotel * Garden City Boys and Girls Club * Plantation Island * Expo Idaho * Glenwood Street bridge * Garden City Library In the Parkcenter Boulevard area bicycling is prohibited on a section which is unpaved and follows the river bank for approximately from Barber Park to East River Run Drive.

A more significant gap in the south bank trail is at the west end of Ann Morrison Park where there is a gap from the Americana Boulevard bridge westward to the Main Street bridge. At the downstream side of the Main Street bridge the south bank trail resumes to approximately east of the Western Idaho Fairgrounds at East 52nd Street. A brief detour via East 52nd Street, Alworth Street and Remington Street returns users to the south bank Greenbelt and continues westward approximately west of the Glenwood Street Bridge. Boise River Greenbelt DOTS A milepost example DOTS is an acronym for Distance & Orientation Trail System. Serving as mileposts, there are over 100 white dots 18 inches (45 cm) in diameter painted on the greenbelt. The purpose of the DOTS is to aid people in locating their position on the greenbelt relative to the downtown Boise central point. The central point, mile 0, is located near the intersection of 8th Street and River Street in downtown Boise. The DOTS are spaced at increments. For example, if one is on the north bank west of the central point one would see a DOT with the inscription NW 1.0. If one is on the south bank east of the central point, one would see the inscription SE 5.3.  Riverside Village Controversy  A stretch of greenbelt west of Glenwood Street in Garden City on the north side has been closed in varying degrees over the last three decades. The former Idaho state land was offered on condition that \\"...they shall construct certain improvements on the State land consisting of a bike path, lakes, pedestrian bridges (where the latter are required to assure a continuous linkage of greenbelt next to the Boise River for the length of the Riverside Village project)...\\", but these terms have never been met. At one point a stretch even had a sign posted stating \\"Private Property. No Trespassing. This is not part of the Boise Greenbelt. Violators will be prosecuted.\\" In 2007, a ban on bicycles through this stretch was approved by Garden City Mayor John Evans. Evans oversaw construction of the Riverside Village neighborhood as the development manager for Idaho Forest Industries (IFI) and Evans Brothers Construction.

Dik-diks stand about at the shoulder, are long, weigh and can live for up to 10 years. Dik-diks are named for the alarm calls of the females. In addition to the females' alarm call, both the male and female make a shrill, whistling sound. These calls may alert other animals to predators.  Name  The name dik-dik comes from an onomatopoeia of the repetitive dik sound female dik-diks whistle through their long, tubular snouts when they feel threatened.  Physical characteristics  Female dik-diks are somewhat larger than males. The males have horns, which are small (about ), slanted backwards and longitudinally grooved. The hair on the crown forms an upright tuft that sometimes partially conceals the short, ribbed horns of the male. The upper body is gray-brown, while the lower parts of the body, including the legs, belly, crest, and flanks, are tan. A bare black spot below the inside corner of each eye contains a preorbital gland that produces a dark, sticky secretion. Dik-diks insert grass stems and twigs into the gland to scent-mark their territories. Apparently to prevent overheating, dik-diks have elongated snouts with bellows-like muscles through which blood is pumped. Airflow and subsequent evaporation cools this blood before it is recirculated to the body. However, this panting is only implemented in extreme conditions; dik-diks can tolerate air temperatures of up to .Dik dik. African Wildlife Foundation. Web. 4 February 2010.  Habitat  Dik-diks live in shrublands and savannas of eastern Africa. Dik-diks seek habitats with a plentiful supply of edible plants such as shrubs. Dik-diks may live in places as varied as dense forest or open plain, but they require good cover and not too much tall grass.Brynn Schaffner and Kenneth Robinson. Savanna. Blue Planet Biomes. They usually live in pairs in territories of about . The territories are often in low, shrubby bushes (sometimes along dry, rocky streambeds) with plenty of cover. Dik-diks, with their dusty colored coat, are able to blend in with their surroundings. Dik-diks have an established series of runways through and around the borders of their territories that are used when they feel threatened.The Living Afridca: Wildlife Bovid Family. library.thinkquest.org  Diet  Dik-dik eating Male at Tarangire National Park, Tanzania A family of Kirk's dik-dik at Lake Manyara, Tanzania Dik-diks are herbivores. Their diet mainly consists of foliage, shoots, fruit and berries, but little or no grass. They receive sufficient amounts of water from their food, which makes drinking unnecessary. Like all even-toed ungulates, they digest their food with the aid of micro- organisms in their four-chambered stomachs. After initial digestion, the food is repeatedly eructated and rechewed, a process known also as rumination, or 'chewing the cud'. Dik-diks' tapering heads may help them eat the leaves between the spines on the acacia trees, and feed while still keeping their head high to detect predators.  Reproduction  Dik-diks are monogamous, and conflicts between territorial neighbors are rare. When they occur, the males from each territory dash at each other, stop short, vigorously nod their heads and turn around. They will repeat this process, increasing the distance each time until one stops. Males mark their territories with dung piles, and cover the females' dung with their own.Dik-Diks ‚Äì Territorial Behavior ‚Äì Male, Territory, Offspring, and Female. Science.jrank.org.

Males, but not females, will attempt to initiate extra-pair mating if an opportunity arises. Females are sexually mature at six months and males at 12 months. The female gestates for 169 to 174 days and bears a single offspring. This happens up to twice a year (at the start and finish of the rainy season). Unlike other ruminants which are born forefeet first, the dik- dik is born nose first, with its forelegs laid back alongside its body. Females weigh about at birth, while males weigh . The mother lactates for six weeks, feeding her fawn for no longer than a few minutes at a time. The survival rate for young dik-diks is 50%. The young stay concealed for a time after birth, but grow quickly and reach full size by seven months. At that age, the young are forced to leave their parents' territory. The fathers run the sons off the territory and the mothers run off the daughters.Scheibe, E. (1999). Madoqua kirkii. Animal Diversity. University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Web. 27 January 2010.

(also known as Crown Media) is an American media production company with corporate headquarters located in Studio City, California, and is owned by Hallmark Cards. Crown Media consists of Crown Media Productions and its Hallmark Hall of Fame, and the Crown Media Family Networks. Crown Media Family Networks is the Hallmark Channel and its spin- offs Hallmark Movies & Mysteries and Hallmark Drama in the United States. Background Since 1951, Hallmark Cards has owned the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology movie series and later its corresponding production company, Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions. From 1990 to 1996, Republic Pictures Home Video distributed Hallmark Hall of Fame films to home video market. From 1987 to 1992, Hallmark was involved in ownership of the Spanish language Univision broadcast network, along with their owned-and-operated stations. In 1989, it partnered with Jones Intercable to create the Jones Crown Partners partnership, which owned ten Wisconsin cable systems. History =Crown Media= Crown Media Inc. was formed in 1991 by Hallmark Cards Inc. to purchase cable television systems and programming vehicles and was originally based in Dallas. Initially, Hallmark and Crown Chairman and CEO James Hoak owning 98% and 2% respectively. Hoak was formerly chairman of multi-system operator Heritage Communications and cable TV industry executive. First Crown intended to create three geographic cable system groups with at least 1/2 million subscribers by the end of 1994. Crown initially purchased Jones Crown Partners plus another market system from Jones Intercable for a total of 140 thousand accounts. Cencom Cable Associates Inc., based in St. Louis owning systems with 160,000 subscribers and managing other systems with 390,000 subscribers, was purchased by the end of 1991. This made Crown Media a top 20 US multi-system operators (MSO). With a planned move of Cencom's headquarters to Dallas in January 1993, its top executives left to form Charter Communications. Near the end of 1993, Hallmark evaluated its Crown Media holding, then with 800 thousand subscribers, by investment banker Goldman, Sachs. Crown Media sold its cable systems in June 1994 for $900 million to Charter Communications and Marcus Cable. =Hallmark Entertainment= Crown Media thus shifted directions in 1994 with the sale of the cable systems. In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as a production company for the Hall of Fame series and other projects for theaters or TV under president Brad Moore. Also in April of that year, Hallmark Cards purchased RHI Entertainment for $378 million plus $50 million in debt getting a 1,800-plus hours film library. Hallmark Entertainment was formed in December 1994 with RHI and Signboard Hill becoming subsidiaries. Robert Halmi Jr. continued his RHI positions of president and CEO at Hallmark Entertainment. Hallmark also purchased a 9.9% stake in Flextech. Hallmark Entertainment, with Flextech's assistance, then formed Hallmark Entertainment Network, Inc. in mid-1995 to start the Hallmark Entertainment Network (HEN) pay TV channel in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The company waited to start a domestic channel due to lack of carriage space and its programming domestic rights were held by others. Hallmark Entertainment purchased in early January 1995 the Filmation library from Paravision, a L'Oreal subsidiary. Hallmark Home Entertainment division was formed by Hallmark Cards in January 1995 to distribute films to the home video market. Hallmark Home Entertainment, along with Cabin Fever, were acquired by Artisan Entertainment in 1998. Hallmark Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company started a partnership in May 1998 to launch the Kermit Channel in Asia and Latin America starting in September 1998 with distribution handled by Hallmark Entertainment Network. The HEN channel had internationally about six million subscribers at this time. Hallmark Entertainment in November 1998 took a 22.5 percent stake in Odyssey Holdings, operator of the Odyssey Network. Hallmark hired former Fox Kids Network worldwide vice-chairman Margaret Loesch to overhaul Odyssey into a family channel. =Crown Media Holdings= Crown Media was reformed into Crown Media Holdings, Inc. in 2000 as part of a re-organizational plan that included the company going public. Crown Media Holdings was formed as a subsidiary of Hallmark Entertainment (Hallmark). Hallmark, Chase Equity Associates, Liberty Media, and the National Interfaith Cable Coalition transferred Hallmark Entertainment Network, Inc. and a total of 77.5 percent interest in the Odyssey Network into Crown Media Holdings. Hallmark received all Crown Media Class B shares, which were worth ten votes each, thus control of Crown Media. After originally planned for April 2000, the initial public offering (trading on the NASDAQ under Ticker Symbol: CRWN) was delayed for market conditions until May 2000, selling 10 million shares at $14 per share for about $140 million. Hallmark president and CEO Robert Halmi, Jr. became chairman of Crown Media while hired IPO expert David Evans became president and CEO of Crown Media Holdings.

In payment for the titles, Crown Media took on $220 million in debt and granted over 30 million shares of stock to Hallmark Entertainment. Hallmark's stake in the company was then about 65 percent of the company's outstanding common stock and completed on October 1, 2001. In March 2004, Hallmark Entertainment sold the Filmation library to Entertainment Rights for $20 million (¬£11 million). Crown Media in January 2004 started the Hallmark Movie Channel as an outlet for additional movies and series available to the Hallmark Channel but does not have the room to use. The new channel was on track in 2005 to have 9 million subscribers by the end of 2006. In 2005, Hallmark Entertainment put the Hallmark Channel up for sale, but with disappointing offers with drew the channel from the market. Losing $233 million in 2005, Hallmark got a tax- sharing agreement allowing Crown's losses to applied against Hallmark Card's gains. Crown Media had $750 million in loans from Hallmark Cards out of a total of $800 million total loans against $1 billion in equity. While minority investors, Liberty Media International Inc. and JPMorgan Chase, might have sold, company management move to clean up the balance sheet and acquire new programming.

He would receive a bonus if the channel was sold. Schleiff left as CEO in May 2009; he was replaced by Bill Abbott, previous ad sales head. Crown Media had about 1.1 million in debt thus is attempting to increase revenue and expected to refinance its debt in 2010. Schleiff left to attempt to help other small cable channel to become a major channel like he did with Court TV. He also increase the reach of Hallmark to 86 million homes at the time he left. Abbott moved most movies to Hallmark Movies while attempt to move to a lifestyle focus similar to such as Scripps Networks Interactive channels. After two content deals for the Hallmark Channel in March 2010, Crown Media and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia were in discussion about launch a joint venture channel, Hallmark Home.

On March 9, 2016, Hallmark Cards announced it was buying the remaining less than 10% of Crown Media Holdings traded publicly and taking the company private.

The privatization was completed later that year. NBCUniversal agreed to purchased Sparrowhawk Media, international operator of Hallmark Channel, in August 2007. With Hallmark trademark rights reverting in July 2011, Universal Networks International switched over the international Hallmark channels to either Diva Universal, 13th Street Universal, Studio Universal, Universal Channel or shut them down.

They are distinguished by their ovate bodies, 2‚Äì6 mm long and yellowish in color, and short antennae in which the first two antennomeres are longer than the others. The larvae are elongate, 4‚Äì10 mm in length, with short but well-developed legs. Both adults and larvae are found in fast-moving water, feeding on algae and wood. The family is known only from the New World, and consists of 12 species in a single genus Lutrochus, although it is likely that the genus will be divided upon review. The genus has been variously classified under Dryopidae and Limnichidae, but has more recently been given its own family. References * William D. Shepard, \\"Lutrochidae\\", in Ross H.

History Founded in 1432 by William Sevenoke as a part of his last will and testament, the school was intended to give a classical education to boys from the town, free of church constrictions. Sevenoke‚Äôs will also provided for almshouses for poor men and women.Sevenoaks Almshouses Sevenoaks School is one of the oldest lay foundations in England. Sevenoke was Mayor of London and, as a friend of Henry V, may have been influenced by the MP for Shropshire and King's pleader, David Holbache, who founded Oswestry in 1407. According to William Lambarde and Richard Johnson (Nine Worthies of London), Sevenoke was a foundling, whose decision to establish the school and almshouses may have been inspired by his early history. In 1560, in response to a petition by Ralph Bosville and Sevenoaks parishioners, Elizabeth I issued letters patent incorporating the school, giving it the right to use her name, and changing its governance. A seal was issued bearing Bosville's initials and the motto Servire Deo Regnari Est. Ralph Bosville was Clerk of the Court of Wards and Liveries, a JP and owner of the Manor of Bradbourne near Sevenoaks, and under the conditions of the letters patent, he and his heirs were to serve on the governing body as long as they lived in Kent. He has been described as the school's 'second founder'.J T Lennox, Sevenoaks School and its Founder, 1432‚Äì1932 (1932) Supporting the letters patent, statues and ordinances were issued in 1574 and a private Act of Parliament passed in 1597. The school also received a number of bequests during the sixteenth century and during this period was brought to wider attention by William Lambarde's A Perambulation of Kent (1576). The school is thought to have been initially housed in small buildings near the present site, before a school house was built. Rebuilding took place in 1631, under the supervision of Thomas Pett. It was again rebuilt in 1724, to the designs of Lord Burlington, a friend of the headmaster of the time, Elijah Fenton. Building work was completed in 1732. During this period the Master and scholars were housed outside the town. The school remained small until the late 19th century. School records show that between 1716 and 1748, under the headmastership of the Revd Simpson, school numbers dropped from 'a great many scholars' to only four boys. Simpson resigned and was replaced by Edward Holme, a distant relative of Sir Richard Burton. By 1778 there were around 60 pupils, and the same is indicated in the School Inquiry Commission of 1868. In 1884 the governors appointed Daniel Birkett as headmaster. It was Birkett's vision to elevate the school's status to that of a First Grade Classical School. He started this revolution, reducing the number of free places to the townfolk and expanding boarding. When he resigned in the 1890s the school had over 100 boys. Birkett's revolution was continued by George Heslop who increased the size to a peak of 134 boys, although numbers dropped towards the end of the First World War (during which 350 Old Sennockians enlisted). Geoffrey Garrod followed Heslop in 1919. In the same year, the headmaster's wife, Mrs Garrod, started a new school for younger boys; Sevenoaks Prep School started with six pupils in the school Cottage Block. An element of selection entered the admissions process in the early 1920s. James Higgs-Walker succeeded Garrod in 1924. Higgs-Walker, or \\"Jimmy\\" as he was known by the boys, started a revolution at the school with the introduction of day houses, the expansion of school sports and extracurricular activities and the vast expansion of the school with the help of the school's greatest benefactor since the founder, Charles Plumptre Johnson (or C.P.J.), who served as a governor from 1913 to 1923 and chairman from 1923 to his death in 1938. Johnson donated many gifts to the school with his brother, Edward: *The Flagpole, 1924, *Thornhill, 1924 (Johnson's House), *Johnson's Hall, 1936 (Now Johnson's Library), *The Sanitorium, 1938, *Park Grange and the surrounding estate, 1946 Higgs-Walker led the school until 1956 when he was succeeded by L.C. (Kim) Taylor. Taylor's headship was something of a 'golden age', when the school became more prominent nationally through Taylor's introduction of a number of innovative teaching methodologies, \\"Mr. Taylor, the Headmaster,has built so successfully on the work of his predecessor that in the ten years he has been at Sevenoaks it has changed from an old- established minor public school ... into an experimental outpost of the Headmasters' Conference'.White, B., Paterson, N. et al., 1965, Experiments in Education at Sevenoaks, Constable Young Books, London, quotation on flyleaf. During the 1960s the school was a pioneer in developing a variety of approaches to education and in community involvement, notably in attracting international students ‚Äì today pupils come from over 40 countries. The school was a pioneer in the introduction of 'The New Maths', an approach to teaching the subject which made it less abstract, and more engaging for pupils. The school adopted the textbooks and examination regime of the School Mathematics Project(SMP) which had been pioneered at a number of other private schools.White et al. The final period of every Wednesday was set aside for the sixth form to attend lectures, usually with a current affairs theme. Speakers have included public figures such as trade union leaders Ray Buckton (ASLEF) and Hugh Scanlon (AEU), boxer Henry Cooper, philosopher A.J. Ayer and astronomer Patrick Moore.White, B., Paterson, N. et al., 1965, Experiments in Education at Sevenoaks, Constable Young Books, London. In 1968 Taylor was succeeded by Michael Hinton who was himself succeeded by Alan Tammadge in 1971. In 1976, the school first admitted girls and moved from being a single- sex school to a co-educational one. In 2012, the Independent review of A level and IB results, based on government issued statistics, ranked Sevenoaks School 1st in the UK, ahead of Westminster (17th), St Paul's (22nd), Harrow (34th), Winchester (73rd) and Eton (80th). Controversies =Fee-fixing cartel= Between 2001 and 2004, Sevenoaks School orchestrated the Independent school fee fixing scandal, a fee-fixing cartel involving fifty prominent independent schools in the United Kingdom. It was subsequently found guilty of operating a fee-fixing cartel by the Office of Fair Trading. The Independent Schools Council ‚Äì a lobby group funded by the independent schools in question ‚Äì said that the investigation had been \\"a scandalous waste of public money\\". =Inflation of predicted grades= In June 2020, The Guardian reported that, as formally codified as a school policy in the staff handbook, Sevenoaks School had for 'many years' exaggerated the predicted exam results of '1 in 12' of its students (20 per year). This policy was outlined in full in July 2020 by The Daily Telegraph, which revealed that 'in around 20 cases a year' the school inflated predicted grades 'to facilitate the application' of the student to university. Mary Curnock Cook commented that it was 'embarrassing for Sevenoaks that deliberately overpredicting students‚Äô grades is in writing in their guidelines'. The Charity Commission stated that it had engaged with the school over 'a broad set of concerns including predictions' and 'governance concerns', with which investigation the school said it was 'cooperating fully'. UCAS confirmed that it had already sent the school a reminder of its guidelines, and the Department for Education warned that 'Schools should not be inflating predicted grades'. The school 'refuted any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate UCAS predictions' and then announced that it would edit the staff handbook to 'ensure there is no confusion'. Furthermore, after initially stating that its accuracy in predicting grades 'significantly outperformed the national average', the school clarified that its predictions did not outperform the national average. The International_Baccalaureate stated that the last five years of predictions were 'in line with' results. Robert Sackville-West, 7th Baron Sackville, who sits on the UK board of the International Baccalaureate, was Chair of Trustees at the school from 2002 until 2008, and since 2012 has been Chair of the Trustees of the Sevenoaks School Foundation, a charity that acts as the fundraising arm of the school. https://www.sevenoaksschool.org/support-us/the- foundation/the-trustees/ On 25 June 2020, Shadow Education Secretary Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie posed a written question to the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, asking 'what discussions they have had with Sevenoaks School'. Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the Department for Education, replied that 'the school has been reminded about [UCAS] guidelines' and that 'Schools should not be inflating predicted grades.' https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers- statements/written-question/Lords/2020-06-25/HL6189/  In literature  * Sevenoaks Schoolmaster William Painter introduced his translation of William Fulke's Antiprognosticon (1560) with a letter written from Sevenoaks. * The finding of William Sevenoke is described by William Lambarde in A Perambulation of Kent (1576). * William Camden mentions the school and almshouses in Britannia (1586). * A school tradition, cited in the prospectus and school history,Brian Scragg, Sevenoaks School, A History (1993) maintains that Sevenoaks is the 'grammar school' of Jack Cade's speech in Henry VI Part 2, Act 4, scene 7.

M. Meyers (ed.), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East, Oxford University Press 1997 p.299. The founding members gained their first experience in 1921, when they participated in the establishment of kibbutz Geva. At first, the settlers suffered from very severe operating conditions in the swamps and malaria was widespread. In April 1927 the kibbutz was visited by the Czechoslovak president Tom√°≈° Masaryk. In 1928 the members of the adjacent kibbutz Heftziba discovered on their grounds the remains of the Beth Alpha synagogue, dating back to the Byzantine period. During the Arab riots of 1929 the kibbutz was attacked and its fields destroyed. When in April 1936 the Arab uprising broke out, the Arabs again set fire to the surrounding fields. In 1940 some of the members, affiliated with Hashomer Hatzair, moved to kibbutz Ramat Yohanan, in exchange for supporters of Mapai from Ramat Yohanan. According to the Jewish National Fund, this move was prompted by an ideological split. In subsequent years the kibbutz was one of the centers used by the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah. On 1 April 1948 the kibbutz was attacked by Arab mortar fire. The Arabs withdrew as a platoon from the 1st parachute battalion of the British 6th Airborne Division approached.

The institute, which served as a school for the surrounding area, offered boarding and had an array of sports facilities and workshops enabling professional training. At the end of 2003 the institute was closed and the complex of buildings has since been used for various educational courses. During the 2006 Lebanon War, the kibbutz took in evacuees from the border villages that had been under rocket attack by Hezbollah militants from southern Lebanon. After the war an absorption center for Ethiopian immigrants was set up here. Some 600 people are offered boarding, Hebrew language courses, and are prepared for integration in the Israeli society.

His play Checkmates, starring Paul Winfield and Denzel Washington, ran on Broadway in 1988. Early life Ronald Milner was born on May 29, 1938 in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up on Hastings Street, also known as \\"Black Bottom\\". It had \\"muslims on corner, hustlers and pimps on another, winos on one, and Aretha Franklin singing from her father's church on the other\\", said Geneva Smitherman, author of Black World. Milner would tell David Richards in a Washington Star interview: \\"The more I read in high school, the more I realized that some tremendous, phenomenal things were happening around me. What happened in a Faulkner novel happened four times a day on Hastings Street. I thought why should these crazy people Faulkner writes about seem more important than my mother or my father or the dude down the street. Only because they had someone to write about them. So I became a writer.\\" He attended Northeastern High School. He also briefly attended Highland Park Junior College and Detroit Institute of Technology. In 1962 he won the John Hay Whitney Foundation fellowship to help aid him to complete a novel, \\"Life With Father Brown,\\" which remains unpublished. He went to New York City to join Harvey Swados's writing workshop at Columbia University. Under the mentorship of Langston Hughes, Milner was able to get a Rockefeller Foundation grant. His first break came in 1966 with Who's Got His Own. The play begins with the funeral of a harsh father, Tim Bronson, and ends with a tentative rebirth for his long-suffering widow and his embittered son and daughter, Tim, Jr., and Clara. The unsuspected truths that Mrs. Bronson is driven to reveal about their father ultimately enable Tim and Clara to see the real lives of their parents, as painful as it is. The expression that has historically been thwarted, which is primarily at the core in the play, is the question of black manhood. The protagonist is a highly combative and alienated son, torn by despair over ever being able to respect or love a father he has long since written off as a fierce tyrant at home and a coward at work. The show toured colleges in New York before going to the Lafayette Theatre in 1967. The Warning‚ÄîA Theme for Linda was part of the A Black Quartet with four plays by Amiri Baraka, Ed Bullins, Ben Caldwell, and Milner, produced by Woodie King, Jr.. It was put up at Brooklyn Academy of Music's Chelsea Theater Center on April 25, 1969. He met Woodie King, Jr. when he was 19. He would inspire Milner to write, and from that came Life Agony. His second work, Who's Got His Own, became a smash hit off-Broadway. These two worked together for more than forty years. He was the artist in residence at Lincoln University in 1966‚Äì1967. He taught at Michigan State University from 1971‚Äì1972. Founder and director of Spirit of Shango theatre company. He also led play writing classes at Wayne State University. Milner's works included Who's Got His Own (inspired by Billie Holiday's \\"God Bless the Child\\"), What the Wine-Sellers Buy (the first play by an African American produced by Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival at Lincoln Center), and Roads to the Mountaintop (a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.). Milner taught creative writing at the University of Southern California, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University. Milner served as a mentor to writer and journalist J. Samuel Cook, whom he met at a conference in Toledo, Ohio. Cook attributes the success of his award-winning play Barren Fields to Milner's direction. In 2003, Milner directed a play at the Hope Repertory Theatre. Milner died in Detroit of complications from liver cancer. He is survived by five children and eight grandchildren.

He was the director of the National Observatory of Athens in Greece from 1858 to 1884. Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt. Biography As a student at a gymnasium in Hamburg, he impressed with his sense of form and drawing abilities and demonstrated a strong interest in science. When he was 14, he came into the possession of a copy of Selenotopographische Fragmente by Johann Hieronymus Schr√∂ter, and this influenced a lifelong interest in selenography, the study of the Moon. He went to school in Hamburg and visited the Altona Observatory, where he became acquainted with the well-known map of the Moon made by Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich M√§dler. R√ºmker taught him the fundamentals of astronomical observation (1842‚Äì1845). In 1845, he obtained a position as an assistant at the private Benzenberg observatory in Bilk near D√ºsseldorf, but a year later joined the Bonn Observatory under Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. In 1853 he became director of Baron von Unkrechtsberg's private observatory at Olm√ºtz (today Olomouc, Czech Republic). In 1858, he became director of the new National Observatory of Athens in Greece, where the clear skies were very suited to astronomical observation, and where he spent the rest of his career. He spent most of his career since his youth making drawings of the Moon, preparing a map of it. In 1866 he made the astonishing claim that Linn√© crater had considerably changed its appearance, which began a controversy that continued for many decades. Coming from such a careful lifelong observer, the claim carried some weight; however, the claim is generally considered unproven. By 1868 his map of the Moon was almost ready, although he did not put the finishing touches to it until 1874. This was the first map of the Moon to surpass the celebrated map of Beer and M√§dler. On 24 November 1876 he discovered Nova Cygni, also known as Q Cygni. In 1878, Schmidt also edited and published all 25 sections of a moon map by Wilhelm Gotthelf Lohrmann. Lohrmann had completed his map in 1836 but had died in 1840; only the first four sections of the map had been published in 1824. Schmidt was awarded the Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in recognition of this selenographic work. He also studied volcanism and seismic phenomena on Earth, sometimes at the risk of his life. He was a pioneer in using the aneroid barometer for measuring altitude. He published a work on the physical geography of Greece. Other interests were the physical nature of comets and the brightness and periodicity of stars. He received an honorary doctorate from Bonn in 1868. When he died, the King and Queen of Greece attended the funeral oration at his observatory. Legacy The crater Schmidt on the Moon is jointly named for him and two other people of the same last name. Schmidt crater is named for him and Otto Schmidt.

Charles Rycroft, A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London, 2nd Edn, 1995) The reaction formations belong to Level 3 of neurotic defense mechanisms, which also include dissociation, displacement, intellectualization, and repression.  Theory  Reaction formation depends on the hypothesis that > \\"[t]he instincts and their derivatives may be arranged as pairs of > opposites: life versus death, construction versus destruction, action versus > passivity, dominance versus submission, and so forth. When one of the > instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly > or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending > impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate > towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of > love to conceal the hostility.\\"Calvin S. Hall, A Primer of Freudian > Psychology (New York, 1954) Where reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form. Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely masks the hate to hide it from awareness. In a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where exaggeration, compulsiveness and inflexibility were observed. For example, > \\"[r]eactive love protests too much; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and > affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another > feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is > defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the > opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. > It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; > rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it > would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface. Reaction formation is sometimes described as one of the most difficult defenses for lay people to understand; this testifies not merely to its effectiveness as a disguise, but also to its ubiquity and flexibility as a defense that can be utilized in many forms. For example, > \\"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against > coprophilia\\", and it is not unknown for an analyst to explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, > \\"[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against > primitive object cathexes rather than realistic values that are capable of > being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude > sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal > sinfulness.\\" Even more counter-intuitively, according to this model > \\"[a] phobia is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he > fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the > object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled. The concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as Stockholm syndrome, a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.

She served during the First Barbary War and the War of 1812 until the Royal Navy captured her in 1814. The British never commissioned her but apparently used her for a year or so as a lazaretto, or a prison vessel. She then disappears from records.  Description  Syren was designed by Benjamin Hutton, Jr. of Philadelphia and built for the Navy in 1803 at Philadelphia by shipwright Nathaniel Hutton and launched on 6 August 1803. She was commissioned in September and Lieutenant Charles Stewart was appointed in command. She was sharper, but smaller than USS Argus (1803), yet carried the same armament. Both vessels were built the same year for the First Barbary War. Service history in US Navy =First Barbary War= Syren departed Philadelphia on 27 August 1803 and reached Gibraltar on 1 October. A fortnight later she sailed via Livorno to Algiers carrying presents and money to the Dey of Algiers. She then sailed to Syracuse, Sicily, where she arrived early in January 1804. The first action Syren was involved in was an attack aimed at destroying , a frigate that had run aground the previous autumn and that Tripolitan gunboats had then captured. To prevent Philadelphia from opposing his planned operations against Tripoli, the commander of the American squadron in the Mediterranean, Commodore Edward Preble, decided to destroy her. To achieve this, Syren and ketch sailed from Syracuse on 3 February 1804 and proceeded to Tripoli, which they reached on 7 February. However, before the American ships could launch their attack, they were driven off by a violent gale and did not get back off Tripoli until 16 February. Before the attack Syren tied up alongside Intrepid to transfer some of her crew for the assault on Philadelphia. Aboard Intrepid, under the command of Stephen Decatur, sailors from both Intrepid and Syren succeeded in burning Philadelphia. Also present during the assault was Thomas Macdonough of Syren.Skaggs, 2003: Thomas Macdonough: Master of command in the early U.S. Navy, p.42 Bombardment of Tripoli, 1804 Syren returned to Syracuse on the morning of 19 February. On 9 March, she and sailed for Tripoli. Soon after their arrival, on 21 March 1804, she captured the armed brig Transfer belonging to the Pasha. Stewart took Transfer into US service and renamed her . She then served in the American squadron. The very next day Syren captured a polacca named Madona Catapolcana and sent her to Malta. Operations in the Mediterranean during the spring and summer of 1804 and participated in the attacks on Tripoli in August and September 1804. The ship continued to support the squadron's operation against Tripoli which forced the Pasha to accede to American demands. After a peace treaty with Tripoli was signed on 10 June 1805, the brig remained in the Mediterranean commanded by Master Commandant John Smith for almost a year helping to establish and maintain satisfactory relations with other Barbary states. The ship returned to America in May 1806 and reached the Washington Navy Yard in August. She was laid up in ordinary there until recommissioned in 1807 and subsequently carried dispatches to France in 1809. In 1809, her sailing master at the Norfolk Navy Yard was Captain John \\"Mad Jack\\" Percival. The following year, her name was changed to Siren.The source for renaming is Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, however contemporary reports of the ship after 1809 still refer to the ship's name as Syren =War of 1812= Little record has been found of the brig's service during the War of 1812, however small news items appeared in the Salem Gazette and the Boston Gazette. In May 1813 it was reported that within the space of two days a merchant vessel, Pilgrim, was boarded, first by which was searching for Syren, and then by Syren, which was searching for Herald. Syren was now commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Bainbridge. The following month Syren left Belize and proceeded to Cuba where after three weeks searching for a Royal Navy sloop, probably Herald, she sailed for the coast of Florida putting in at New Orleans before departing on 9 May 1813. No prizes were taken during this voyage and the ship needed repairs. By January 1814 Syren was in Massachusetts and was now commanded by Lieutenant Parker, In February she sailed along with a privateer, Grand Turk. Not long after sailing Parker died and command transferred to Lieutenant N.J. Nicholson. Syren captured at least three merchant ships off the coast of Africa. On 28 May she captured and burnt , Hassler, master, which had been sailing from Africa to Liverpool. Then on 1 June Syren captured Adventure, which too was from Africa to Liverpool. She took-off their cargoes of ivory and sank them. Lastly, at some point Syren captured Catherine. On 12 July 1814 Syren while cruising off the West African coast encountered the British ship a 74-gun third rate ship of the line under the command of Captain Augustus Brine. Heavily outgunned, Syren attempted to run. After an 11-hour chase Medway captured her despite Syren having lightened her load by throwing overboard her guns, anchors and boats. During her last voyage she had captured or sunk several British merchantmen. Among the prisoners was Samuel Leech, who later wrote an account of his experiences. According to Samuel Leech, after being captured the crew of Syren were taken to the Cape of Good Hope, and after landing at Simonstown, marched to a jail in Cape Town. Here they were held until transferred to England when the war was over. On arriving at Simonstown, other American prisoners were seen to be leaving the jail and being shipped off to Dartmoor. The Syren crew met these again in England while waiting for transfer to the United States. Some had been present at 'The Massacre'. British service history After the capture by Royal Navy she had a figurehead of mermaid installed. The Royal Navy used her as a lazaretto. She is no longer listed after 1815.

Shehri was an elementary school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. In early 2000, he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems. He and his younger brother Waleed traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al-Qaeda training camp. The brothers were chosen, along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his last will and testament on video. Shehri arrived in the United States in early June 2001, staying in budget motels in the Boynton Beach area of south Florida. On September 5, 2001, Shehri traveled to Boston and checked into a motel with his brother. Six days later, Shehri arrived early in the morning at Boston's Logan International Airport and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, Shehri, along with his brother Waleed and three others, hijacked the airliner. They deliberately crashed it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. In the aftermath of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported that Shehri was the son of a Saudi diplomat and was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since.  Background  Abha is the capital of Saudi Arabia's Asir province, where Wail al-Shehri was from, and Wail graduated from Abha's teacher college. Wail al-Shehri and his younger brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar neighborhood in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, Wail knew little English. During high school and college, Shehri was deeply religious and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young people in the region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family. After graduating from Abha teachers college in 1999, Wail al- Shehri took a job as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.  Afghanistan  Wail and Waleed al-Shehri disappeared after going to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague about when they would return. Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions. In March 2000, he left for Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al- Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot (\\"muscle\\") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States. Once Wail and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received $2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on October 3, 2000, and then obtained United States visas on October 24. On his visa application, Wail al- Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer/school as \\"South City\\", and his destination as \\"Wasantwn\\". Wail indicated his occupation as \\"teacher\\", and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with Wail's teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States. In late 2000, Wail traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes that in mid-November 2000, three of the future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence. Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on Al Jazeera in September 2002. Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of Abdulaziz al-Omari reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.  United States  On June 5, 2001, Wail obtained an International Driving Permit, which was issued in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Wail al- Shehri arrived together with fellow al-Qaeda member Ahmed al-Haznawi at Miami International Airport, via London, from Dubai on June 8. Both were admitted as tourists for six months. Shehri opened a bank account at SunTrust Bank in Florida on June 18, with a deposit of $8,000 that came from American Express traveler's cheques purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates. Shehri moved into the Homing Inn, a budget motel in Boynton Beach, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami. Wail and Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they received Florida state non- driver identifications on July 3. Shehri checked into the Panther Motel & Apartments, in Deerfield Beach, with his brother and Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, Wail was a member of the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and Suqami. During the summer of 2001, Wail regularly used computers at the Delray Beach Public Library. On August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11, using the Mail Boxes Etc. in Hollywood, Florida, as their address. The Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462. Wail checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, on September 5, 2001, staying in room 432. While staying at the Park Inn, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri may have called a prostitute. Wail al- Shehri accompanied his brother on September 9 to the Travelex at Logan International Airport, where Waleed attempted to wire $5,000 to the United Arab Emirates. Waleed had insufficient documentation, so Wail and Waleed returned the next day to complete the transaction. Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad received the funds on September 11 at Al-Ansari Exchange in Sharjah. Hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari possibly spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine, on September 10. When Wail and Waleed al- Shehri checked out on September 11, they left a sheet of instructions for flying a jet behind in their hotel room.  Attacks  Wail al-Shehri, his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. By 07:40, all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight 11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. It is suspected that the brothers stabbed two flight attendants in the hijacking. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta, who was flying the plane, deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.  Aftermath  Waleed al-Shehri was reported to have been found alive by a BBC News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Reports said that the Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat's son was trained as a pilot at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was working as a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines. At the time of the attacks, he was in Morocco for a training program. There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat's son was the victim of mistaken identity. Jamal Khashoggi, of Al-Watan and ArabNews in Saudi Arabia, spoke with Muhammad Ali al-Shehri in Khamis Mushait, who said his sons Wail and Waleed had been missing for months. Wail al-Shehri's father denied reports that Wail had an aeronautics degree, as some news reports said, \\"My son Wail was 25 years old and had a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher‚Äôs College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah.\\" His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that Wail and Waleed were involved in the September 11 attacks, \\"If that turns out to be the truth, then I'll never, never accept it from them. I'll never forgive them for that.\\" Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled \\"A Saudi Apology\\" for Dateline NBC aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed Shehri's brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed. Saudi officials later stated that the names of the hijackers were in fact correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to 9/11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.

Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the electoral districts of state legislative chambers must be roughly equal in population. Along with Baker v. Carr (1962) and Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of \\"one person, one vote\\" to U.S. legislative bodies. Prior to the case, numerous state legislative chambers had districts containing unequal populations; for example, in the Nevada Senate, the smallest district had 568 people, while the largest had approximately 127,000 people. Some states refused to engage in regular redistricting, while others enshrined unequal representation in state constitutions. The case of Reynolds v. Sims arose after voters in Birmingham, Alabama challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature; the Constitution of Alabama provided for one state senator per county regardless of population differences. In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires states to establish state legislative electoral districts roughly equal in population. Warren held that \\"legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.\\" In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to apply to voting rights. The decision had a major impact on state legislatures, as many states had to change their system of representation. Historical background That a State Senate was to represent rural counties, as a counterbalance to towns and cities, was understood before the industrialization and urbanization of the United States. State and national legislatures had been reluctant to redistrict. This reluctance developed because there existed general upper- class fear that if redistricting to meet population changes were carried out, voters in large, expanding or expanded urban areas would vote for confiscatory wealth redistribution that would severely inhibit the power of business interests who controlled state and city governments early in the century. Of the forty-eight states then in the Union, only seven twice redistricted even one chamber of their legislature following both the 1930 and the 1940 Censuses. Oregon did not redistrict between 1907 and 1960, Illinois not between 1910 and 1955,Baker; Rural Versus Urban Political Power; p. 14 while Alabama and Tennessee had at the time of Reynolds not redistricted since 1901. In Connecticut, Vermont, Mississippi, and Delaware, apportionment was fixed by the states' constitutions, which, when written in the late eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, could not have imagined the possibility of rural depopulation as was to occur during the first half of the century. In New Hampshire the state constitutions, since January, 1776, had always called for the state senate to be apportioned based on taxes paid, rather than on population. Having already overturned its ruling that redistricting was a purely political question in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Court ruled to correct what it considered egregious examples of malapportionment; these were serious enough to undermine the premises underlying republican government. Before Reynolds, urban counties nationwide often had total representations similar to rural counties, and in Florida, there was a limit to three representatives even for the most populous counties. The case Voters from Jefferson County, Alabama, home to the state's largest city of Birmingham, had challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature. The Alabama Constitution provided that there be only one state senator per county. Ratio variances as great as 41 to 1 from one senatorial district to another existed in the Alabama Senate (i.e., the number of eligible voters voting for one senator was in one case 41 times the number of voters in another). Among the more extreme pre-Reynolds disparities claimed by Morris K. Udall: * In the Connecticut General Assembly, one House district had 191 people. * In the New Hampshire General Court, one township with three people had a Representative in the lower house; this was the same representation given another district with a population of 3,244. * In the Utah State Legislature, the smallest district had 165 people, the largest 32,380. * In the Vermont General Assembly, the smallest district had 36 people, the largest 35,000. * Los Angeles County, California, then with six million people, had one member in the California State Senate, as did the 400 people of one rural county (Alpine County, California). * In the Idaho Senate, the smallest district had 951 people; the largest, 93,400. * In the Nevada Senate, seventeen members represented as many as 127,000 or as few as 568 people. =Decision= The eight justices who struck down state senate inequality based their decision on the principle of \\"one person, one vote.\\" In his majority decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren said \\"Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.\\" In addition, the majority simply denied the argument that states were permitted to base their apportionment structures upon the Constitution itself, which requires two senators from each state despite substantially unequal populations among the states. Justice Tom C. Clark wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Potter Stewart also issued a concurring opinion, in which he argued that while many of the schemes of representation before the court in the case were egregiously undemocratic and clearly violative of equal protection, it was not for the Court to provide any guideline beyond general reasonableness for apportionment of districts. In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that the majority had chosen to ignore the language, history, and original intent of the Equal Protection Clause, which did not extend to voting rights. The dissent strongly accused the Court of repeatedly amending the Constitution through its opinions, rather than waiting for the lawful amendment process: \\"the Court's action now bringing them (state legislative apportionments) within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment amounts to nothing less than an exercise of the amending power by this Court.\\" The Court soon extended \\"one person, one vote\\" to all U.S. congressional districts in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), but not to the Senate. =Aftermath= Since the ruling applied different representation rules to the states than was applicable to the federal government, Reynolds v. Sims set off a legislative firestorm across the country. Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois led a fight to pass a constitutional amendment allowing legislative districts based on land area, similar to the United States Senate. He warned that: Numerous states had to change their system of representation in the state legislature. For instance, South Carolina had elected one state senator from each county. It devised a reapportionment plan and passed an amendment providing for home rule to counties. However, allegations of State Senates being redundant arose, as all states affected retained their state senates, with state senators being elected from single-member districts, rather than abolishing the upper houses, as had been done in 1936 in Nebraska (and in the provinces of Canada), or switching to electing state senators by proportional representation from several large multi-member districts or from one statewide at-large district, as was done in Australia. =Praise= In a 2015 Time Magazine survey of over 50 law professors, both Erwin Chemerinsky (Dean, UC Berkeley School of Law) and Richard Pildes (NYU School of Law) named Reynolds v. Sims the \\"best Supreme Court decision since 1960,\\" with Chemerinsky noting that in his opinion, the decision made American government \\"far more democratic and representative.\\" See also * Rotten borough, an English phenomenon * The Shaff Plan * Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v.

He died in a coup d'etat against President Francisco I. Madero. Born in a prominent liberal family in the western state of Jalisco, he served in the army, rising to the rank of general. Like his political patron, General and then President Porfirio D√≠az, Reyes was a military man who became an able administrator. Reyes was one of the state governors that D√≠az appointed, serving as governor of the northern state of Nuevo Le√≥n. He implemented Porfirian policy, particularly eliminating political rivals, but also building his own power base. He helped in the modernization of that state, enabling local industrialization, improving public education and health, and supporting improvements in the lives of workers.Alan Knight, The Mexican Revolution, New York: Cambridge University Press 1986, vol. 1, p. 49.Bernardo Reyes (Mexican politician) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia While governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, Reyes approved a workers compensation law. Followers of Reyes were known as Reyistas. Reyes served in the cabinet for two years as Minister of War, and there he created an expanded military force, the Second Reserve which had some 30,000 men and a significant budget. The force came to be considered Reyes's private army by the Cientificos.Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1, p. 49. Reyes was emerging as a counterweight to the influence of the Cient√≠ficos. As D√≠az aged and the presidential succession became an open topic of discussion, he was emerging as a potential candidate. D√≠az disbanded the Second Reserve and Reyes returned to Nuevo Le√≥n as governor, and his popularity grew. A way to manage the presidential succession would have been to have a viable candidate run in the 1910 elections as D√≠az's vice president. Clubs supporting Reyes were organized in a number of major cities, although Reyes himself did not openly court political power and actively supported D√≠az's run for the presidency despite his published statement that he was not going to seek re- election. The center of Reyes's political power was in his home state of Jalisco; D√≠az's supporters closed Reyes clubs and jailed their leaders. His main support came from the middle class, many of whom had connections to the now disbanded Second Reserve. Reyes was seen as a reformer, anti-Cient√≠fico, pro-business, with a strong following among professionals such as doctors and lawyers, and a viable candidate of the old order with both military and political experience who could manage a presidential transition.Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1, p. 52. He was not an outsider or radical agitator. Together with Jos√© Yves Limantour, he was considered as one of the potential successors of Porfirio D√≠az.Lyle C. Brown, Review of El Gran General Bernardo Reyes by E. V. Niemeyer Jr. (translated by Juan Antonio Ayala) in Hispanic American Historical Review Vol. 47, no. 3, p. 422 With Francisco Madero's latter challenge to the dictator in the 1910 elections and, afterwards, initiation of the Mexican Revolution, previous notions of who should succeed D√≠az were discarded. For a time Reyes was a supporter of Madero, but he later led the first rebellion against Madero. After this rebellion failed, Reyes was imprisoned in the Mexico City prison of Santiago Tlatelolco. General F√©lix D√≠az was imprisoned at another Mexico City jail for rebellion, but the two were able to easily communicate despite that and plot a joint coup against Madero. They tried to get General Victoriano Huerta to join the plot, but he declined, despite Huerta's being a proteg√© of Reyes's.Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 1, p. 481 General Manuel Mondrag√≥n sent forces to free Reyes from jail on 9 February 1913, who freed Reyes from prison. Then, they marched on to the National Palace in the beginning of the Ten Tragic Days. Reyes was killed on day 1 of the coup, in an assault on the palace. He had expected to enter the National Palace and declare Madero ousted. Before he could enter the building, Reyes was shot dead along with 400 others, among them civilians.Knight, Alan.

Originally Morton & Weaver, a proprietary engine manufacturer in Hillfields, Coventry, founded in 1904, the company changed its name to Coventry Victor Motors in 1911, the company closed in 1971. Morton & Weaver Thomas Morton & William Arthur Weaver formed a partnership as Morton & Weaver Limited in Coventry in 1904 as engineers and toolmakers. In 1911 they formed a new company the Coventry Victor Motor Company to continue their interest in motor engineering while the original company continued as tool makers. Coventry Victor aero engines Mr W A Weaver was a pioneer in designing and building aircraft, and by 1905 Mr Weaver was designing and building his first ornithoplane (monoplane) utilising a 9hp engine built by Johnson, Hurley and Martin Ltd. Although it was claimed it flew at Hampton-in-Arden in July 1906, it was just \\"short hops\\", and it was reported that \\"the machine more or less failed due to lack of engine power\\".\\"Key Contributions to Land Sea and Air Transport\\", Coventry Evening Telegraph, 17 Dec 1948, p6 The Weaver Ornithoplane No 2 was built from No 1 but with a more powerful engine and was towed on its own wheel behind a motor car to Hampton-in-Arden (the wings being strapped to the sides of the car), and was assembled and flown on 17 May 1910. In a series of four tests the Ornithoplane achieved a steady flight for a quarter of a mile, becoming the first monoplane to fly in Britain. The construction was of aluminium and bamboo, with an aluminium propellor driven by a 20hp engine, and a wing span of about 45 feet.\\"Coventry Aeroplane, Tried at Hampton\\", Coventry Evening Telegraph, 17 May 1910, p3 The four cylinder engine was also made by Johnson, Hurley and Martin at their Alpha Engine Works in Gosford Street, Coventry.\\"A flying first over Hampton\\", Coventry Evening Telegraph, 28 Aug 1975, p21 In 1955 Major W.A.

Coventry Victor motorcycles In 1919 Coventry-Victor, using their 688 cc flat-twin engine, started making motorcycle and sidecar combinations many of which were used as commercial outfits and became one of England's leading producers of horizontally opposed twins. They also had a factory in Brussels, and in 1922 they sold one of their motor-cycles to \\"H.M. King of the Belgians\\", with all parts being made in Coventry and assembled in Brussels.\\"Royal Honour for a Coventry Motor-Cycle Firm\\", Coventry Standard, 1 July 1922, p2 The 1927 Coventry-Victor Silent Six has today become a sought after classic motorcycle. Motorcycle production ended in 1936. The company also supplied engines to many motorcycle and cyclecar makers. Examples include the Victoria Motor & Cycle Co, who launched their 688cc Victor engined motorcycle in 1919,Forecast and Guide To Olympia, The Motor Cycle, 20th Nov 1919, p590Late Arrivals at Olympia, The Motor Cycle, 26th Nov 1919, p158 and Grahame-White cyclecars. Coventry Victor cars Coventry-Victor 3-Wheeler 1933 By 1926, the company found a new scope of activity: they launched their own design two-seater, three-wheeler car with the single wheel at the rear as the Coventry Victor Midget. There were many versions including, the Standard, the Sports, the Super Sports, the De-luxe, and the Parcelcar; prices started at ¬£75. The cars used variants of their own horizontally-opposed twin-cylinder engines of 688 cc at first, later enlarged to 749 cc, 850 cc and finally 998 cc. These engines included side-valve and overhead valve air cooled versions of the engine (fan assisted), and water cooled versions. Drive was to the rear wheel via a two speed gearbox and chain drive. Early cars had a foot brake operating on the transmission, but later sports model had twin front brakes as well as electric start and reverse gear. There was an update in 1932 with styling by C F Beauvais and called the Luxury Sports with three-speed gearbox and costing from ¬£110. The previous models remained available. Car production survived until 1938. After the Second World War, a prototype codenamed Venus was made with flat-four 747 cc engine never reached production. There were six reported Venus Prototypes all of which were ordered to be destroyed but one still exists at the Coventry Transport Museum. Little is known about the vehicle but it was found and recovered from a farm in the West Country in the 1980s Other products Victor Cub in a Jowett, Queensland Maintaining their preference for the opposed twin cylinder design, Coventry Victor Motor Co built a twin cylinder diesel in the early 1930s known as the Cub. The design of the engine was illustrated in a GB patent by W.A. Weaver, M. Hamilton- Fletcher, and Victor Oil Engine Co in 1933.Lubrication arrangements for compression-ignition internal combustion engines, GB430333, Priority Date 11 Oct 1933 Bristol Tractor pictured a Cub-engined version of their tractor in 1933, though they fitted several different engines and it's not clear how many tractors were produced with the Cub engine. In 1935 the Coventry Victor Cub engine was available as the 19.5 hp Cub and 22 hp Cub Senior (10HP and 12HP nominal rating), and was described as originally having been designed for marine work.The Modern Diesel, Third Edition, Iliffe & Sons, 1935, p150, p215 The Victor Cub was promoted in Australia as having been used for cars and marine work and as a stationary power unit. The 1000 cc air-cooled twin- cylinder horizontally opposed engine was rated at 10 hp and gave a peak output of 20 hp at 2800 rpm. It could run at up to 4000 rpm without danger though normally governed to between 2000 and 2800 rpm. The light alloy combined crankcase and water jackets enclosed cast iron wet liner cylinder bores. The horizontally opposed shape of the engine made it particularly suitable to fit Jowett vehicles. It also suited boats of more than 15 tons displacement and an overall length of 34 feet or 10 metres.The Herald, Melbourne page 16, 7 September 1936 In 1938 Bristol Tractor re-introduced the Bristol 10 tractor with the Coventry Victor Cub diesel engine in the model \\"D\\", with production continuing to 1942.

The crankcases, cylinder heads, and pistons were all of aluminium alloy. The camshaft and crankshaft ran in ball bearings. These were available air cooled (with added fan and cowling for stationary use), and as water cooled units for marine use which included outboard motors. After the war Coventry Victor Motor Co produced a range of petrol and diesel engines for marine and industrial use. The diesel engines included air and water cooled vertical single cylinder units (AD1, AD2, AD3 and WD1, WD2, WD3 models respectively), twin cylinder air-cooled HDA model, and water-cooled HDW models (also known as the Vixen). The petrol engines included twin cylinder air- cooled MA2 and AN4 models, and twin cylinder water-cooled MW2 and WN4 models. The AN4 was used in the 1950s by Thomas Green & Son on their 'Griffin' models PRR and PRY motorised rollers. Coventry Victor also produced a flat-four air- cooled petrol engine (the AC4 or 'Neptune'), one use of which was in aircraft pressure test trolleys made by Sir George Godfrey & Partners. Major W.A. Weaver (managing director of the Coventry Victor Motor Co) converted one of these in 1955 for use in a Piper Cub aircraft, naming it the 'Flying Neptune'.Coventry Victor Flying Neptune, Flight, 27 September 1957, p510 Coventry Victor engines were also used in airfield pumping sets and to operate hydraulic ramps such as the Hylo Mk II mobile lifter made by Aviation Traders (Engineering) Ltd in the 1960s.Ground Equipment at Geneva, Flight International, 27 June 1963, pp1027-1028 Present day The Coventry Victor Motor Company Ltd was wound up voluntarily in January 1971.The London Gazette, 29 January 1971, p1048 A.N.

During the greater part of his life he lived in DeLand, Florida. His aliases and stage names included: \\"Volta the Great\\", \\"The Man with the Radar Mind\\", \\"The White Wizard,\\" and \\"Gideon ('Gid') Dayn.\\" Career Hull claimed to be ‚Äî and is generally credited as ‚Äî the inventor of the Svengali deck of cards, which he patented in 1909. He claimed to have invented more than 500 magical effects and he was a prolific writer, with 52 published books to his name, including Sealed Mysteries and Sleights, The Encyclopedia of Stage Illusions, Sealed Mysteries, and How to Answer Questions for Crystal Gazing and Mind Reading Acts. He wrote on a wide variety of magical subjects, including card tricks, mentalism, escapes, razor blade swallowing, sightless vision, billiard ball manipulation, silk magic, second sight acts, publicity, and showmanship. Hull not only produced many titles about magical effects, he also performed and taught magic for more than 80 years. In his earlier \\"White Wizard\\" years, he performed an act dressed entirely in white in which he made billiard balls and silks vanish, multiply, and reappear. In later years he gave talks to magic conventions on business methods for entertainers. Hull was active in the movement to recognize that there are intellectual rights to magic methods and he was a strong advocate for the protection of magic trade secrets by both patents on the gimmicks and copyright on the texts, as applicable. However, he undercut his own ethical stance against plagiarism by publishing secret material from other magicians who had stolen ideas from him, in order to get revenge for having been plagiarized. In the late 1950s Hull published a newsletter, The G_d D__n Truth About Magic, mainly for the purpose of criticizing the equally famous mentalist Robert A. Nelson, known on stage as \\"Korda RaMayne.\\" Hull used the pseudonym Gideon (\\"Gid\\") Dayn to expose Nelson's effects under the pretense of \\"reviewing\\" them. Hull's weighty three- volume Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mentalism, published in 1961, was the largest compilation of mentalism sleights, gimmicks, effects, patter, and illusions in one collection up to that date. This work was also notable as the venue in which Hull continued to carry out his excoriating feud with Robert Nelson, whom Hull accused in print of teaching mentalism to gamblers and racketeers in order that they might commit what Hull called \\"thievery of the public.\\" He also criticised Nelson for selling hoodoo folk magic curios that Hull said were used in rituals of \\"black magic and Devil worship\\". In his final years, Hull lost his eyesight, a loss he never learned to accept. He died at the age of 93 in a nursing home. Hull's life and his impact upon the world of stage magic were described in a 1977 biography, The Edison of Magic and His Incredible Creations, written by Samuel Patrick Smith. Both his Svengali Deck of 1909 and his 33 Rope Ties and Chain Releases, written in 1915, are still popular today. Correspondence with Harry Houdini Hull was the author of 33 Rope Ties and Chain Releases (1915). It was alleged that the magician Harry Houdini had borrowed information for his own Magical Rope Ties and Escapes (1921). However, a 1947 edition of Hull's book has an introduction titled \\"Houdini Did Not Steal This Book\\". According to Hull: > \\"It is true that a book DID appear with the name of Houdini listed as the > 'author', which did steal the entire contents of my original book. It > purloined the original 'Patter\\" and the original presentations for the > tricks and even reproduced exactly several of the illustrations. In addition > this counterfeit book deliberately changed the names of the original tricks > bearing my name and avoided giving any credit to the original author and > inventor ... But Houdini explained away the matter [and] paid me a fair but > moderate sum ... I accepted his explanation as plausible and ... we remained > good friends.\\" Similar to Houdini, exposing the tricks of spiritualist mediums interested Hull. His writings on this subject were collected and published in 1977 under the title The Billion Dollar Bait.

The spacious, resonant interior was one of the inspirations for the music of the Venetian School. In music history, the Venetian School was the body and work of composers working in Venice from about 1550 to around 1610, many working in the Venetian polychoral style. The Venetian polychoral compositions of the late sixteenth century were among the most famous musical works in Europe, and their influence on musical practice in other countries was enormous. The innovations introduced by the Venetian school, along with the contemporary development of monody and opera in Florence, together define the end of the musical Renaissance and the beginning of the musical Baroque. History Several major factors came together to create the Venetian School. The first was political: after the death of Pope Leo X in 1521 and the Sack of Rome in 1527, the long dominant musical establishment in Rome was eclipsed: many musicians either moved elsewhere or chose not to go to Rome, and Venice was one of several places to have an environment conducive to creativity.Gangwere, p. 246. Another factor, possibly the most important, was the existence of the splendid St Mark's Basilica, with its unique interior with opposing choir lofts. Because of the spacious architecture of this basilica, it was necessary to develop a musical style which exploited the sound-delay to advantage, rather than fought against it: thus the Venetian polychoral style was developed, the grand antiphonal style in which groups of singers and instruments played sometimes in opposition, and sometimes together, united by the sound of the organ. The first composer to make this effect famous was Adrian Willaert, who became maestro di cappella of St. Mark's in 1527, and remained in the position until his death in 1562. Gioseffo Zarlino, one of the most influential writers on music of the age, called Willaert \\"the new Pythagoras,\\" and Willaert's influence was profound, not only as a composer but as a teacher, since most of the Venetians who followed studied with him. Yet another factor which promoted the rich period of musical creativity was printing. In the early 16th century, Venice, prosperous and stable, had become an important center of music publishing; composers came from all parts of Europe to benefit from the new technology, which then was only a few decades old. Composers from northern Europe‚Äîespecially Flanders and France‚Äîwere already renowned as the most skilled composers in Europe, and many of them came to Venice. The international flavor of musical society in the city was to linger into the 17th century. In the 1560s, two distinct groups developed within the Venetian school: a progressive group led by Baldassare Donato, and a conservative group led by Zarlino, who was then maestro di cappella. Friction between the two groups came to a head in 1569 with a dramatic, public conflict between Donato and Zarlino during the Feast of Saint Mark. Members of the conservative branch tended to follow the style of Franco-Flemish polyphony, and included Cipriano de Rore, Zarlino, and Claudio Merulo; members of the progressive group included Donato, Giovanni Croce, and later Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. An additional point of contention between the two groups was whether or not Venetians‚Äîor at least Italians‚Äîshould be given the top job of maestro di cappella at St. Mark's. Eventually the group favoring local talent prevailed, ending the dominance of foreign musicians in Venice; in 1603, Giovanni Croce was appointed to the job, followed by Giulio Cesare Martinengo in 1609. The peak of development of the Venetian School was in the 1580s, when Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli composed enormous works for multiple choirs, groups of brass and string instruments, and organ. These works are the first to include dynamics, and are among the first to include specific instructions for ensemble instrumentation. Organists working at the same time included Claudio Merulo and Girolamo Diruta; they began to define an instrumental style and technique which moved to northern Europe in the succeeding generations, culminating in the works of Sweelinck, Buxtehude, and eventually J.S. Bach. The term Venetian School is sometimes used to distinguish it from the contemporary, and usually more musically conservative, Roman School. Other important centers of musical activity in Italy at the same time included Florence (the birthplace of opera), Ferrara, Naples, Padua, Mantua, and Milan.

The Beech rises about northwest of Lexington, Tennessee. In the same area are the headwaters of two other West Tennessee rivers, the Big Sandy River and the Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River. The Big Sandy, like the Beech, is part of the Tennessee River system, whereas the Forked Deer system drains into the Mississippi River. The Beech River was named for the beech timber along its course. Hydrography The Beech flows southeast into the town of Lexington and then primarily eastward. As is typical of most major streams in West Tennessee, much of the lower course was the subject of a channelization project in the mid-20th century conducted largely for agricultural purposes; this has resulted in a considerable loss of wetland. The stream crosses into Decatur County, flowing in between Parsons and Decaturville. The large embayment formed at the mouth of the Beech is the result of the backwaters of the Kentucky Dam project many miles downstream on the Tennessee; the embayment reaches the outskirts of both towns.

The dams are purely for purposes of flood control and recreation, though it is possible that the relatively small volume of water they store could result in some minimal aid to navigation on the Tennessee under some conditions. Unlike most other TVA dams, none of the Beech River dams are used for hydropower, since the small size of the streams impounded and their relative lack of fall would make power generation impractical. Some of the lakes created are located in Natchez Trace State Park, the largest of the Tennessee state parks; though located many miles west of both the Natchez Trace Parkway and the historic Natchez Trace, this area is named for a branch of the historic Trace that bore that name in the area.

He briefly served as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party in the 1920s. Career The son of Robert Robson, he came to Canada with his family in 1882, studied law in Regina, was called to the bar for the Northwest Territories in 1892 and practised in the Northwest Territories, moving to Winnipeg in 1899. Robson married Fannie Laidlaw in 1897. He was named to the Court of King's Bench in 1909 and then served as head of the Manitoba public utilities commission from 1911 to 1914. The Manitoba Liberals were in government between 1915 and 1922, but lost much of their support to the United Farmers of Manitoba (later called the Progressives) in the early 1920s. Despite Premier Tobias Norris's personal popularity, the Liberals were reduced to only eight seats in the province's 55-member legislature following the election of 1922. Norris remained party leader until 1927, but stepped down shortly before that year's election. He was replaced by Robson, who seems to have been chosen because of his status as a \\"respected outsider\\", and because he was regarded (incorrectly) as favouring cooperation with the Progressives. He had no experience as a provincial politician, but was a leading figure in the province's legal system. Robson led the Liberal ticket in Winnipeg for the province's 1927 election, and placed second on the city's multi-member ballot (Winnipeg elections were determined by a form of proportional representation at the time). He was only able to elect one other Liberal in the city, however, and his party won only seven seats throughout the province. Robson stood down as leader in January 1930, and resigned his seat shortly thereafter. He then served as a judge in the Manitoba Court of Appeal from 1930 to 1943, later becoming a Chief Justice of Manitoba. Robson died at the Winnipeg General Hospital at the age of 74. Robson Hall at the University of Manitoba is named in his honour.

Most are gases at room temperature and pressure. They are frequently used in air conditioning and as refrigerants, R-134a was one of the most commonly used HFC refrigerants, in place of the older chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 and hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as R-21. They do not harm the ozone layer as much as the compounds they replace, but they do contribute to global warming, with thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Their atmospheric concentrations and contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly increasing, causing international concern about their radiative forcing. Fluorocarbons with few C‚ÄìF bonds behave similarly to the parent hydrocarbons, but their reactivity can be altered significantly. For example, both uracil and 5-fluorouracil are colourless, high-melting crystalline solids, but the latter is a potent anti-cancer drug. The use of the C-F bond in pharmaceuticals is predicated on this altered reactivity.G. Siegemund, W. Schwertfeger, A. Feiring, B. Smart, F. Behr, H. Vogel, B.

The American bombers conducted a strategic bombing raid on ball bearing factories to reduce production of these vital parts for all manner of war machines. This was the second attack on the factories at Schweinfurt. American wartime intelligence claimed the first Schweinfurt‚ÄìRegensburg mission in August had reduced bearing production by 34 percent but had cost many bombers. A planned follow-up raid had to be postponed to rebuild American forces. As the squadrons rebuilt, plans for the return mission were modified based on the lessons learned. Planners added additional fighter escorts to cover the outward and return legs of the operation and sent the entire force against Schweinfurt alone, instead of splitting the force. Despite these tactical modifications, a series of minor mishaps combined with the ever-increasing efficiency of the German anti-aircraft effort proved to be devastating. Of the 291 B-17 Flying Fortresses sent on the mission, 60 were lost outright, another 17 damaged so heavily that they had to be scrapped and another 121 had varying degrees of battle damage. Outright losses represented over 26 percent of the attacking force. Losses in aircrew were equally heavy, with 650 men lost of 2,900, 22 percent of the bomber crews. The American Official History of the Army Air Forces in the Second World War acknowledged losses had been so great that the USAAF would not return to the target for four months, \\"The fact was that the Eighth Air Force had for the time being lost air superiority over Germany\\". The operation was a failure. The bomber formations were left exposed to unrelenting attacks by German fighters and the improper preparations for the creation of reserves in the summer of 1943 meant that such costly operations could not be sustained. An escort of 24 squadrons of Spitfires equipped with drop tanks was provided on the first and last leg of the mission.Clostermann 1951 The strategy of the Allied air forces was flawed. Arthur Harris, Air Officer Commanding RAF Bomber Command questioned the intelligence that claimed ball bearings to be vital to the German war economy. Harris refused to cooperate with the Americans, believing ball bearing targets to be a \\"panacea\\".Mc Farland and Wesely-Phillips in Cargill, 1998, p. 197. Post-war analysis has shown Harris's objections to be correct.Webster and Frankland 1961, pp. 64‚Äì70. The Germans had built up enormous reserves of ball bearings and were receiving supplies from all over Europe, particularly Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. The operation against these industries would, even if successful, have achieved little.Murray and Millett 2000, p. 313.Luttwak 2002, p. 56. By 1945, the Germans had assembled more reserves than ever.Boog, Horst, Vogel and Krebs 2001, p. 75. Mission Factories in and around Schweinfurt accounted for a significant amount of German ball-bearing production. The Kugelfischer plant produced 22 percent, the Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken I and II produced 20 percent, and another one percent came from the Fichtel & Sachs factory. After the German ball bearing \\"bottleneck\\" had been identified in 1942 and ball bearings had been named the second-most-vital Pointblank industry for the Combined Bomber Offensive in March 1943, Schweinfurt's ball bearing plants were selected for a second air raid after being bombed during the August Schweinfurt‚ÄìRegensburg mission. Each of the three bomber wings was to be escorted by fighters from a single group with multiple squadrons of P-47 Thunderbolts. The fighters were inexplicably not employing drop tanks which limited their escort range.Terdoslavich, William. \\"Raids on Ploesti and Schweinfurt: August 1943 and October 1943\\", in Fawcett, Bill, ed. How To Lose WWII. New York: Harper, 2010, p. 147. One fighter outfit was sidetracked to escort a squadron of 29 B-24s that switched to a diversion mission to Emden because of the bad weather forecast. Some 229 of 291 B-17s hit the city area and ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt, Germany in two groups: the first group bombed at 1439‚Äì1445 hours, the second group at 1451‚Äì1457 hours. They claimed 186 Luftwaffe aircraft. 60 B-17s were lost, two damaged beyond repair and 13 damaged; casualties amounted to five KIA, 40 WIA and 594 MIA. In addition, the bomber formations were spread out and vulnerable because of bad weather. The Luftwaffe military intelligence officers had suspected a deep penetration air raid because of the substantial raids. The Luftwaffe's Jagdgeschwader 3 Udet fighter wing intercepted the bombers as they crossed the coast but P-47s succeeded in shooting down seven Bf 109s while losing just one P-47. However one P-47 was also lost when it crashed at Herongate and another during a one- wheel landing on base.RAF & US Fighter Commands ‚Äì with annotated text.

The 305th Bomb Group lost 13 of its 16 B-17s in minutes.Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 135. The B-17s were attacked after bombing by fighters that had refueled and rearmed (JG 11 downed 18 B-17s).Caldwell & Muller 2007, pp. 135‚Äì37. A total of 13 bombers were shot down by German fighters and flak and 12 bombers were damaged so badly that they crashed upon return or had to be scrapped. Another 121 bombers returned with moderate damage.Price 2005, p. 151. Of 2,900 crewmen, about 254 men did not return (65 survived as prisoners-of-war),Hess 1994, p. 65. while five killed-in-action and 43 wounded were in the damaged aircraft that returned (594 were listed as missing-in-action). Among the most seriously affected American units was the 306th Bomb Group. It lost 100 men: 35 died on the mission or of wounds and 65 were captured. The 305th Bomb Group lost 130 men (87%), with 36 killed.Hess 1994, pp. 65‚Äì67 The defensive efforts of both JG 1 and JG 11 during the \\"Black Thursday\\" raid are said to have included substantial use of the BR 21 unguided stand-off rockets against the USAAF combat boxes, as both Luftwaffe fighter wings had started use of the ordnance some six months earlier. Result Although the Schweinfurt factories were badly hit, the mission failed to achieve any lasting effect. The production of ball bearings in the factories was halted for only 6 weeksBowman & Boiten (2001), p. 74 and Germany's war industry could easily rely on its substantial inventory of ball bearings as well as a large production surplus. In addition, the ball bearing facilities were dispersed to reduce their bombing risk. Consequently, despite General Henry H. Arnold's claim that the Black Thursday \\"loss of 60 [downed/ditched] American bombers in the Schweinfurt raid was incidental\\", unescorted daylight bomber raids deep into Germany were suspended until the February 1944 Big Week missions with P-51B Mustang escorts that included additional Schweinfurt day/night USAAF/RAF bombing on the 24th. Another example of the strategy of using heavy bombers against a particular wartime resource, the Oil Campaign of World War II was essentially started by the RAF Bomber Command as early as August 1941 ‚Äî two months after Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, and six months before the United States entered the war. It went forward relentlessly from that time with the USAAF joining in on the efforts by late June 1943 during daylight. The Oil Campaign had its priority diminished from time to time with important events, such as the lead- up to Operation Overlord, which by June 1944 demanded heavy bomber support for a time, but soon thereafter the relentless attacks by day and night resumed, starving the entire German Wehrmacht military of fuel and lubricants from the autumn of 1944 onwards.

Pavel (\\"Pavka\\") Korchagin is the central character. Analysis The story is a fictionalized autobiography. In real life, Ostrovsky's father died, and his mother worked as a cook. As he joined the war with the Red Army, he lost his right eye from artillery fire during the war. Characters * Pavel Korchagin ‚Äì The novel's protagonist. He is fighting on the Bolsheviks' side in the Civil War (1918‚Äì1921). He is a quintessential positive hero of socialist realism. * Tonia Toumanova ‚Äì Pavel's teenage love. Tonia and Pavel became good friends after their first encounter, which later develops into an intimate relationship. Though born of a wealthy and influential family, Tonia treated everyone equally unlike her friends, who only interact with other children of well-reputed families. However, this changed as she grew up, as she became more aware of her appearance and social status of others. Publication history The first part of How the Steel was Tempered was published serially in 1932 in the magazine Young Guard. The second part of the novel appeared in the same magazine from January to May, 1934. The novel was published in 1936 in book form in a heavily edited version that conformed to the rules of socialist realism. In the serial version Ostrovsky had described the tense atmosphere of Pavel's home, his suffering when he became an invalid, the deterioration of his relationship with his wife, and their separation. All of this disappeared in the 1936 publication and in later editions of the novel.A History of Soviet Literature, pgs 43‚Äì44, Vera Alexandrova, Doubleday, 1963. A Japanese translation of the novel was made by Ryokichi Sugimoto. Adaptations In the Soviet Union, three films were produced based on this novel: *How the Steel Was Tempered, 1942 *Pavel Korchagin, 1956 (Korchagin was played by Vasily Lanovoy) * How the Steel Was Tempered, 1973 (TV series of 6 episodes; Korchagin was played by Vladimir Konkin) * In China, the novel was adapted into a television series of the same title in 2000; all the members of the cast were from Ukraine.

They were originally formed in 1998 by Daniel Wylie and Stephen Fleming, and later they were joined by Mark Brown, James Clifford and Paul Docherty. To date they have recorded five albums, and had four singles in the UK Top 40. Recording history They self-released the albums Deliverance (1999) and Panorama (2000), both having been recorded in a community funded recording studio located in Glasgow's Castlemilk housing scheme. Both albums were named in Virgin's Encyclopaedia of the Greatest Albums of All Time. Cosmic Rough Riders signed a one album license deal with Poptones Records, the newly formed label of ex-Creation Records boss Alan McGee, who released the band's third album, Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine in November 2000, actually a compilation of songs from Panorama and Deliverance. Single releases in 2001 earned them increasing numbers of fans in the press. Their single \\"Revolution (In the Summertime?)\\" was released and went into the UK Singles Chart, scoring them their first Top 40 hit and debut on BBC Television's Top of the Pops. This was immediately followed into the chart by \\"The Pain Inside\\", giving them back-to- back Top 40 hit single success. By the end of 2001, the album Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine had achieved silver status (sales of 60,000) in the UK and it was named by Q magazine as one of the 50 best albums of the year. In March 2002, founder member of Cosmic Rough Riders, Stephen Fleming added lead vocals to his duties when original singer, Daniel Wylie, left to pursue a solo career. The release in September 2002 of the rarities and b-sides album, Pure Escapism, was the closing of one chapter in the band's story. June 2003 saw the release of \\"Because You\\". It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 34 ‚Äì becoming the band's third successive Top 40 hit and their highest entry yet. The self-written and self-produced album, Too Close to See Far was released by Measured Records in July 2003. The entire album was play-listed by BBC Radio 2 and on its release, entered the UK's official independent chart at number 7. A second single from the album was released in September 2003, and \\"Justify the Rain\\" entered the UK Singles Chart, giving the band four Top 40 hits in a row. 2003 ended with Cosmic Rough Riders being the recipients of the best newcomer award at the Tartan Clef Awards ceremony, an event that raised over ¬£100,000 for the charity, Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy. The band were presented with their award by Scotland's First Minister, Jack McConnell. During 2005 the band wrote and recorded a new album, The Stars Look Different from Down Here, in southern Spain. The album was released in May 2006. Touring history The Cosmic Rough Riders have performed at major UK music festivals including Carling Weekend, Glasgow Green and T In The Park. The band have played at the Norwegian festival Quart; plus two Japanese festivals, Summersonic and Fuji Rock. They have appeared as guests of several other touring artists, including the Black Crowes, Ocean Colour Scene, Stereophonics, Paul Weller, Robert Plant, Lenny Kravitz, and were twice invited to appear as special guests of U2 when they performed in Scotland. When they made a special appearance at Glasgow Barrowlands as part of a show paying tribute to the Scottish singer- songwriter Frankie Miller, they were joined onstage by Joe Walsh (Eagles). He played guitar on the track \\"When I'm Away From You\\", recorded by Cosmic Rough Riders, and released on a Frankie Miller tribute album.

Nagios offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. It alerts users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved. Ethan Galstad and a group of developers originally wrote Nagios as NetSaint. they actively maintain both the official and unofficial plugins. Nagios is a recursive acronym: \\"Nagios Ain't Gonna Insist On Sainthood\\" ‚Äì \\"sainthood\\" makes reference to the original name NetSaint, which changed in response to a legal challenge by owners of a similar trademark. \\"Agios\\" (or \\"hagios\\") also transliterates the Greek word Œ¨Œ≥ŒπŒøœÇ, which means \\"saint\\". Nagios was originally designed to run under Linux, but it also runs well on other Unix variants. It is free software licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.  Overview  Operating principle of Nagios Nagios Core is open source software licensed under the GNU GPL V2. Currently it provides: * Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, ICMP, SNMP, FTP, SSH) * Monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, system logs) on a majority of network operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, using monitoring agents. * Monitoring of any hardware (like probes for temperature, alarms, etc.) which have the ability to send collected data via a network to specifically written plugins * Monitoring via remotely run scripts via Nagios Remote Plugin Executor * Remote monitoring supported through SSH or SSL encrypted tunnels. * A simple plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks depending on needs, by using their tools of choice (shell scripts, C++, Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, C#, etc.) * Available data graphing plugins * Parallelized service checks * Flat-text formatted configuration files (integrates with many config editors) * The ability to define network host using 'parent' hosts, allowing the detection of and distinction between hosts that are down or unreachable * Contact notifications when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via e-mail, pager, SMS, or any user-defined method through plugin system) * The ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution * Automatic log file rotation * Support for implementing redundant monitoring hosts * Support for implementing performance data graphing * Support for database backend (such as NDOUtils) *Push notifications * A web-interface for viewing current network status, notifications, problem history, log files, etc.  Nagios agents  = NRPE = Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) is a Nagios agent that allows remote system monitoring using scripts that are hosted on the remote systems. It allows for monitoring of resources such as disk usage, system load or the number of users currently logged in. Nagios periodically polls the agent on remote system using the \`check_nrpe\` plugin. NRPE allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix machines. This allows you to monitor remote machine metrics (disk usage, CPU load, etc.). NRPE can also communicate with some of the Windows agent add-ons, so you can execute scripts and check metrics on remote Windows machines, as well. = NRDP = Nagios Remote Data Processor (NRDP) is a Nagios agent with a flexible data transport mechanism and processor. It is designed with an architecture that allows it to be easily extended and customized. NRDP uses standard ports and protocols (HTTP and XML) and can be implemented as a replacement for Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA). = NSClient++ = This program is mainly used to monitor Windows machines. Being installed on a remote system NSClient++ listens to port TCP 12489. The Nagios plugin that is used to collect information from this addon is called \`check_nt\`. As NRPE, NSClient++ allows to monitor the so-called 'private services' (memory usage, CPU load, disk usage, running processes, etc.) Nagios is a host and service monitor which is designed to inform you of network problems. = NCPA = The Nagios Cross Platform Agent is an open source project maintained by Nagios Enterprises. NCPA installs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Created as a scale-able API that allows flexibility and simplicity in monitoring hosts. NCPA allows multiple checks such as memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage, processes, services, and network usage. Active checks are queried through the API of the \\"NCPA Listener\\" service while passive checks are sent via the \\"NCPA Passive\\" service. Nagios XI Nagios XI is a proprietary interface using Nagios Core as the back-end, written and maintained by the original author, Ethan Galstad, and Nagios Enterprises. CentOS and RHEL are the currently supported operating systems. It combines Nagios Core with other technologies. Its main database and the ndoutils module that is used alongside Nagios Core use MySQL. While the front-end of Nagios Core is mainly CGI with some PHP, most of the Nagios XI front-end and back-end are written in PHP including the subsystem, event handlers, and notifications, and Python is used to create capacity planning reports and other reports. RRDtool and Highcharts are included to create customizable graphs that can be displayed in dashboards.  2014 controversy over plugins website  On 16 January 2014, Nagios Enterprises redirected the nagios-plugins.org domain to a web server controlled by Nagios Enterprises without explicitly notifying the Nagios Plugins community team the consequences of their actions. Nagios Enterprises replaced the nagios-plugins team with a group of new, different members. The community team members who were replaced continued their work under the name Monitoring Plugins along with a new website with the new domain of monitoring- plugins.org.

He joined a junior-republican movement, Na Fianna Eireann, in 1937 and the following year, joined the Irish Republican Army. In 1969, Cahill was a key figure in the founding of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. During his time in the Provisional IRA, Cahill helped import weapons and raise financial support. He served as the chief of staff in 1972, but was arrested the following year when a ship importing weapons was intercepted. After his release, he continued to serve on the IRA Army Council and lead all financial dealings for Sinn F√©in. In the 1990s, the IRA and Sinn F√©in began to work on seeking peace. Cahill served on the council that called a cessation on 21 July 1996. Cahill attended several of the talks that finally led to the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998. Shortly after the agreement was made, Cahill resigned as treasurer of Sinn F√©in. To honour his service, he was made honorary Sinn F√©in Vice-President for life. Cahill served the Republican movement in Ireland all his life, as one of the longest-serving political activists in Ireland of any political party.  Background  Cahill was born above his father's small printing shop at 60 Divis Street on 19 May 1920Anderson, Brendan, Joe Cahill: A Life in the IRA, Dublin 2002, pp. 17‚Äì18, 61, 246‚Äì49, 279‚Äì80; / in West Belfast. Cahill was the first child of eleven siblings born to Joseph and Josephine Cahill. Both of his parents supported Republicanism. His father was involved with the Irish National Volunteers and would print republican material at his print shop. Joseph Senior applied to be a part of the Irish Republican Army but was asked to remain in the print business as his way of assisting the Republican Movement. He was arrested in 1932 for printing illegal material, but was acquitted for any crimes. Cahill's childhood was marked by hardship and his family was very poor. Cahill's grandparents were neighbours of the Scottish-born Irish socialist and Easter Rising leader James Connolly, who co-founded the Irish Citizens Army. Cahill was educated at St. Mary's Christian Brothers' School, then located on Barrack Street. At age 14 he left school to assist in the print shop. Soon after, he joined the Catholic Young Men's Society, which campaigned on social issues with a focus on eradicating moneylenders from working-class areas of Belfast, as they often charged usurious interest rates. At the age of seventeen, Cahill then joined Na Fianna Eireann, a republican-orientated Scouting movement. Na Fianna Eireann was regarded as the \\"Junior Irish Republican Army\\". Early paramilitary career The following year, 1938, at the age of 18, Cahill joined the local Clonard-based 'C' Company of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. By 1942, Cahill was serving as second in command. That year, during an anniversary march by the IRA for the Easter Rising, Cahill got into a shootout with five other IRA men against four Royal Ulster Constabulary Officers. Several men were wounded and Constable Patrick Murphy was killed. Cahill and four of the other men spent time in prison in Belfast, where they were interrogated daily. Tom Williams, the sixth IRA man to be charged, spent time in the Royal Victorian Hospital due to his injuries. It was there that he made a statement taking full responsibility for killing Constable Patrick Murphy. All six men were found guilty and sentenced to death in August 1942. The men's legal team managed to suspend the execution date after the verdict. An appeal campaign began and 207,000 signatures were collected. The United States State Department and the Vatican also supported the campaign. As a result, the men's sentences were changed to life in prison, except for Tom Williams who was executed. The IRA declared a formal ceasefire in 1945. Afterwards, republican prisoners began to be released. Cahill, Perry, Oliver, Cordner and Simpson, who had all been sentenced to life in prison, became free men in October 1949. Following his release from prison, Cahill got a job at the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast. It was at the shipyards where he was said to have contracted the disease asbestosis, one of the causes of his death many years later. In 1953, Cahill had an accident on the job when he was hit on the head by scaffolding. He subsequently spent time recovering in a convalescent home. After he recovered, he travelled to Leixlip near Dublin to visit his aunt. It was there that he met Annie Magee. Joe and Annie were married on 2 April 1956 in St John's Church on the Falls Road in Belfast. Together they had seven children. Annie was said to be his best friend. The IRA launched a new campaign in 1956. The IRA border campaign attacked ten targets in six counties, damaging bridges, courthouses and border roads. By 1957, three RUC officers and seven republicans had been killed during the campaign. Cahill was arrested and interned in January 1957 with several other republicans. In the same year, Cahill's first son was born and was named Thomas, after Tom Williams. Cahill was released from internment in April 1961. Founding the Provisional IRA Following his release from prison, Cahill was disappointed at the direction of the IRA. They had given up armed struggle, and desired seats in elections. Failed campaigns led to the IRA becoming weak and disorganised. Cahill resigned from the IRA around 1962. In August 1969, intense rioting broke out in Northern Ireland, the most violent being in Belfast. In the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969, Cahill, along with Billy McKee, tried to defend the Catholic Clonard area from attack, but was unable to prevent Bombay Street being burned by Ulster Protestant rioters. When he subsequently tried to organise the defence of the Ballymurphy area, he was initially chased away by its Catholic residents. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots displaced 1,800 families from their homes. It was a humiliation for the IRA and made evident that they could not protect their people. The slogan 'IRA: I Ran Away' was painted on walls all over Belfast. The riots were said to be the beginning of \\"the Troubles\\" in Ireland. Later that year, Cahill was a key figure in founding the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Angry at the failure of the IRA (led in Belfast by Billy McMillen) to defend Catholic areas during the communal rioting, Cahill and McKee stated in September 1969 that they would no longer be taking orders from the IRA leadership in Dublin, or from McMillen. In December 1969, they declared their allegiance to the Provisional IRA, which had split away from the leadership. This action took 9 out of the 13 units of the IRA in Belfast into the Provisional IRA. The remnants of the pre-split IRA became known as the Official IRA. The Provisional IRA was created and an executive council of 12 men was elected. Of the executive members, seven, one of whom was Joe Cahill. were elected to serve as the Provisional Army Council. Cahill also served as the second-in- command to Billy McKee, OC of the Belfast Battalion. Provisional IRA activities In April 1971, after the arrest and imprisonment of Billy McKee, Cahill became the commander of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. He held this post until the introduction of internment in August of that year. It was during this period that the Provisional IRA campaign got off the ground in the city. Cahill authorised the beginning of the IRA's bombing campaign as well as attacks on British troops and the RUC. He based himself in a house in Andersonstown and toured the city, co-ordinating IRA activity. The day after the British Army mounted Operation Demetrius, designed to arrest the IRA's leaders, Cahill held a press conference in a school in Ballymurphy and stated that the operation had been a failure. He said, \\"we have lost one brigade officer, one battalion officer and the rest are volunteers, or as they say in the British Army, privates\\". To avoid the propaganda defeat that his capture would then have entailed, Cahill fled to the Republic of Ireland, temporarily relinquishing his command of the Belfast Brigade. In March 1972, Cahill was part of an IRA delegation that held direct talks with the British Labour Party leader Harold Wilson. However, although the IRA called a three-day ceasefire for the talks, no permanent end to violence was agreed upon. Upon his return to Ireland, Cahill was arrested in Dublin by Garda√≠ and charged with IRA membership. He went on hunger strike for twenty-three days and was subsequently released due to lack of evidence. In November 1972, Cahill became the IRA's chief of staff and held this position until his arrest the following year. Cahill was then put in charge of importing arms for the IRA. He liaised with the NORAID group in America and with the Libyan dictatorship of Muammar al-Gaddafi to this end. In March 1973 he was arrested by the Irish Navy in Waterford, aboard the Claudia, a ship from Libya loaded with five tons of weapons. Cahill was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Irish Special Criminal Court. Cahill stated at his trial that, \\"If I am guilty of any crime, it is that I did not succeed in getting the contents of the Claudia into the hands of the freedom fighters in this country\\". Upon his release, Cahill again was put in charge of arms importation and to this end went to the United States. He was deported from the United States in 1984 for illegal entry (see Provisional IRA arms importation). He served on the IRA Army Council as late as the 1990s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he argued against proposals for Sinn F√©in to stand in elections. However, in 1985, he spoke at the party's Ard Fheis in favour of republicans contesting elections and taking seats in the Dublin parliament, the D√°il. Peace process In his later years as honorary life vice-president of Sinn F√©in, Cahill was a strong supporter of Gerry Adams and the Good Friday Agreement. In 1994, a controversial but central aspect of the IRA's ceasefire was the granting of a limited visa by then United States President Bill Clinton to Cahill, in the face of opposition by John Major's government,Sinn F√©in: A hundred turbulent years, Brian Feeney, O'Brien Press; 2 edition (17 April 2002), /, p. 409 for the purpose of trying to win support for the new Sinn F√©in peace strategy from Irish American IRA supporters. In 1998 he stood in North Antrim in the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, but was unsuccessful.Election results, ark.ac.uk. Retrieved 21 November 2014. Death Cahill died at age 84 in Belfast. He had been diagnosed with asbestosis, which he probably developed while working at the Harland & Wolff shipyards in his twenties. He and several other former shipyard workers later sued the company for their exposure to the dangerous substances but only won minimal compensation.

This genus contains about 50 scientifically described species. The genus has a wide natural distribution extending from Iraq in the west, to Indonesia and China in the east, and parts of Siberia in the Far East. A particularly high richness of species exists in Myanmar (Burma) and northeastern India, and many Channa species live nowhere else. In contrast, a few widespread species have been introduced to several regions outside their natural range where they often become invasive. The large and medium-sized Channa species are among the most common staple food fish in several Asian countries and they are extensively cultured.Kumar, K., R. Kumar, S. Saurabh, M. Sahoo, A.K. Mohanty, P.L. Lalrinsanga, U.L. Mohanty and P. Jayasankar (2012). Snakehead Fishes: Fact Sheets. Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture, Bhubaneswar. Apart from their importance as a food fish, snakeheads are consumed in some regions as a traditional medicine for wound healing and reducing post-operative pain and discomfort, and collected for the international aquarium pet trade.PracticalFishkeeping (13 June 2016). Quick Guide to Snakeheads. Retrieved 12 February 2019. All snakeheads are highly predatory and the diets of the various species of Channa include fish, amphibians (like frogs), snakes, rodents, birds and invertebrates (like insects and crustaceans). They have a labyrinth organ, which allows them to breathe air for short periods, and they use this adaptation to travel across land in the event that their habitat becomes inhospitable. They are mostly solitary or live in monogamous pairs that are highly aggressive towards outsiders of their own species, but C. pleurophthalma often occurs in small groups. Larger species are mostly nestbrooding (making a nest of vegetation at the water surface), and the dwarfs mostly paternal mouthbrooding, but there are exceptions: the large C. barca is a paternal mouthbrooder and the dwarf C. bleheri is a free-spawner (the eggs float to the surface where the parents take care of them, but they do not mouthbrood or built a nest).SeriouslyFish: Channa bleheri. Retrieved 12 February 2019. In Assamese it is called goroi. In Malayalam it is called varal or braal. In Bhojpuri it is called \\"garai\\". In the Magahi language it is called ‚Äúgarai‚Äù. Since the fish can survive in marshy land, which is not a habitat for normal fishes, there are Magahi phrases like ‚Äògadal garai‚Äô. This is used to describe a person who looks simple but is shrewd. Taxonomy The taxonomy of the genus Channa is incomplete and a comprehensive revision of the family has not been performed. A phylogenetic study in 2010 has indicated the likelihood of the existence of undescribed species of channids in Southeast Asia,Adamson, E.A.S., Hurwood, D.A. & Mather, P.B.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 56 (2): 707‚Äì717. and a more comprehensive phylogenetic study in 2017 indicated that there are several undescribed species in Asia (as well as an undescribed Parachanna in Africa).Conte-Grand, C., Britz, R., Dahanukar, N., Raghavan, R., Pethi-yagoda, R., Tan, H.H., Hadiaty, R.K., Yaakob, N.S. & R√ºber, L.

Life He studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, and went out to India in 1808 as assistant-surgeon on the Bengal establishment of the British East India Company. His knowledge of metallurgy caused him to be attached to the mint at Calcutta, where he was for a time associated with John Leyden. He acted for many years as secretary to the committee of public instruction, and superintended the studies of the Sanskrit College in Calcutta. He was one of the staunchest opponents of the proposal that English should be made the sole medium of instruction in native schools, and became for a time the object of bitter attacks. In 1832 Oxford University selected Dr. Wilson to be the first occupant of the newly founded Boden chair of Sanskrit: he had placed a column length advertisement in The Times on 6 March 1832 p 3, giving a list of his achievements and intended activities, along with testimonials, including one from a rival candidate, as to his suitability for the post. In 1836 he was appointed librarian to the East India Company. He also taughtMen and Events of My Time in India by Sir Richard Temple, John Murray, London, 1882 p. 18, accessed 9 Oct 2007 at the East India Company College. On the recommendation of Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Wilson was in 1811 appointed secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He was a member of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta and was an original member of the Royal Asiatic Society, of which he was director from 1837 up to the time of his death. Wilson is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Works Wilson became deeply interested in the ancient language and literature of India, and was the first person to translate the Rigveda into English. In 1813 he published the Sanskrit text with a free translation in English rhymed verse of Kalidasa's lyrical poem, the Meghaduuta, or Cloud- Messenger.Truebner & Co. (1872) publisher's catalogue entry for Megha-Duta (The), accessed 9 Oct 2007 He prepared the first Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1819) from materials compiled by native scholars, supplemented by his own researches. This work was only superseded by the Sanskritw√∂rterbuch (1853‚Äì1876) of Rudolf Roth and Otto von B√∂htlingk, who expressed their obligations to Wilson in the preface to their great work. He was interested in Ayurveda and traditional Indian medical and surgical practices. He compiled the local practices observed for cholera and leprosy in his publications in the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta.Wilson, H. H.

He was briefly the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and was subsequently a supporter of the province's Liberal-Progressive coalition government.  Biography  James Breakey was born in Millbrook, Ontario on December 25, 1865, the son of James Breakey and Susan McCormick. He was educated in Ontario and then moved to Manitoba, settling on a homestead in Melita from 1882 to 1886. He then was partner in a mercantile business in Souris from 1886 to 1896. In 1892, Breakey married Jennie Hopkins. He served as secretary- treasurer for Souris and for the Rural Municipality of Glenwood. After working as a financial agent, Breakey was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1914, winning Glenwood for the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in the Liberal landslide victory of 1915. The following year, he co-sponsored Fred Dixon's Workmen's Compensation Act, a version of which was subsequently enacted as law. Breakey lost to Independent Farmer William Robson in 1920. He recaptured his seat in 1922 (despite the Liberals losing most of their rural seats to the United Farmers of Manitoba), and was re-elected in 1927. The Manitoba Liberals were a marginal political force following the election of 1922, having won only eight seats in a 55-member legislature. They fell to seven seats in 1927, causing some senior figures in the party to advocate a merger with the governing Progressives. Hugh Robson resigned as Liberal leader in January 1930, and Breakey was chosen to lead the Liberal parliamentary group later in the month. In this capacity, he actively promoted a Liberal- Progressive union: he declined to speak in opposition to the government's 1930 throne speech, and generally attempted to ensure friendly relations between the Liberal and Progressive caucuses. Breakey stepped down as party leader in 1931, and was replaced by Murdoch Mackay. The Liberals and Progressives were merged into a single party shortly thereafter, and Breakey ran for re-election as a supporter of the government. He easily defeated his Conservative opponent, and was re-elected in 1936 and 1941. Despite his long service in the legislature, Breakey was never appointed to cabinet. He retired from politics in 1945, at age 79. He died in Souris on February 27, 1952.

Firefighters typically undergo a high degree of technical training. This involves structural firefighting and wildland firefighting. Specialized training includes aircraft firefighting, shipboard firefighting, aerial firefighting, maritime firefighting, and proximity firefighting. One of the major hazards associated with firefighting operations is the toxic environment created by combustible materials. The four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, elevated temperatures, and poisonous atmospheres. Additional hazards include falls and structural collapse that can exacerbate the problems encountered in a toxic environment. To combat some of these risks, firefighters carry self-contained breathing apparatus. The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire and to identify the specific risks. Fires can be extinguished by water, fuel or oxidant removal, or chemical flame inhibition; though, because fires are classified depending on the elements involved, such as grease, paper, electrical, etcetera, a specific type of fire extinguisher may be required. The classification is based on the type of fires that the extinguisher is more suitable for. In the United States, the types of fire are described by the National Fire Protection Association. History Bulgarian firefighters in action, 1930s Ottawa Fire Department motor pump, Ottawa, Ontario, taken by the Topley Studio, May 1915. The earliest known firefighters were in the city of Rome.

Philadelphia: Board of Regents, 1984. Print. =Historic Tactics and Tools= In the 3rd century B.C., an Alexandrian Greek named Ctesibius made a double force pump called a siphona. As water rose in the chamber, it compressed the air inside, which forced the water to eject in a steady stream through a pipe and nozzle. In the 16th century, syringes were also used as firefighting tools, the larger ones being mounted on wheels. Another traditional firefighting method that survived was the bucket brigade, involving two lines of people formed between the water source and the fire. Typically, men in one of the lines would pass along the full buckets of water toward the fire while in the other line women and children would pass back the empty buckets to be refilled. In the 17th century the first \\"fire engines\\" were made, notably in Amsterdam. In 1721, the English inventor Richard Newsham made a popular fire engine that was essentially a rectangular box on wheels filled using a bucket brigade to provide a reservoir while hand-powered pumps supplied sufficient water pressure to douse fires at a distance. =Ancient Rome= Ancient Rome did not have municipal firefighters. Instead, private individuals relied on their slaves or supporters to take action. They would not only form bucket brigades or attempt to smother smaller fires, but would also demolish or raze nearby buildings to slow the spread of the fire. However, there is no mention of fires being extinguished, rather they were contained and burned themselves out. Ancient Rome did not have an organized firefighting force until the Vigiles were formed during the reign of Augustus. =United Kingdom= Prior to the Great Fire of London in 1666, some parishes in the UK had begun to organize rudimentary firefighting crews. After the Great Fire, Nicholas Barbon introduced the first fire insurance. In order to reduce insurance costs, Barbon also formed his own fire brigade, and other companies followed suit. By the start of the 1800s, insured buildings were identified with a badge or mark indicating that they were eligible for a company's firefighting services. Buildings not insured with a particular company were left by its firefighters to burn, unless they happened to be adjacent to an insured building, in which case it was often in the company's interest to prevent the fire from spreading. In 1833 fire insurance companies in London merged to form The London Fire Company Establishment. Steam-powered apparatuses were first introduced in the 1850s, allowing a greater quantity of water to be directed onto a fire; in the early 1930s they were superseded by versions powered by an internal combustion engine. In World War II the Auxiliary Fire Service, and later the National Fire Service, were established to supplement local fire services. Before 1938, there was no countrywide standard for firefighting terms, procedures, ranks, or equipment (such as hose couplings). In the month of August in 1939 with war looking very possible the Fire Service's act of 1938 came into effect. This unified Great Britain's fire service and prepared them for the German war machine. During the London Blitz, 700 fire men and 20 fire women , as known during the time period died as a result of heavy bombing, 91 of these perished at the same time defending London. By the end of the London Blitz, 327 firefighters had lost their lives. Following the war, leaps and bounds came to the fire service striving into the modern era. This included every firefighter being trained with the Mark 4 proto set. And also reverting back too compressed cork helmets. Firefighting improved even more with the introduction of the Dennis fire appliances that remain iconic in the UK to this day. Sadly, despite the introduction of more advanced firefighting strategies, tactics, and equipment to British firefighting following the blitz, there have been nearly 300 firefighters killed . =United States= In January 1608, a fire destroyed many of the colonists' provisions and lodgings in Jamestown, Virginia. Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia were all plagued by fires, and volunteer fire brigades formed soon after such disasters. In 1736, Benjamin Franklin founded the Union Fire Company in Philadelphia, which became the standard for volunteer fire organizations. These firefighters had two critical tools: salvage bags and so- called bed keys. Salvage bags were used to quickly collect and save valuables, and bed keys were used to separate the wooden frame of a bed (often the most valuable item in a home at the time) into pieces for safe and rapid removal from the fire. The first American attempt at fire insurance failed after a large fire in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1736. Later in 1740, Benjamin Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship to provide fire insurance, which was more successful. The Contributionship adopted \\"fire marks\\" to easily identify insured buildings. Firefighting started to become formalized with rules for providing buckets, ladders, and hooks, and with the formation of volunteer companies. A chain of command was also established. Firefighter duties Aerial video of Firefighting A firefighter's goals are to save lives, protect property, and protect the environment. A fire can rapidly spread and endanger many lives, but with modern firefighting techniques, catastrophe can often be avoided. To prevent fires from starting, a firefighter's duties may include public education about fire safety and conducting fire inspections of locations to verify their adherence to local fire codes. = Firefighter skills = A firefighter doing a ladder slide, which is used to quickly escape from a window Firefighting requires skills in fire suppression, rescue, and hazardous materials mitigation. Firefighters must also have, or be able to acquire, knowledge of department organizations, operations, and procedures, and the district or city street system they will have to negotiate in order to perform their duties. They must meet minimum physical fitness standards and learn various firefighting duties within a reasonable period Examples are: * Building construction *Fire dynamics *Firefighting PPE *Fire extinguishers *Ropes and knots *Ground ladders *Forcible entry *Structural search and rescue *Tactical ventilation *Fire hose operations and streams *Fire suppression *Overhaul, property conservation, and scene preservation *Building materials, structural collapse, and effects of fire suppression *Technical rescue support and vehicle extrication operations *Foam fire fighting, liquid fires, and gas fires *Hazardous materials response = Specialized skills = Specialized areas of operations may require subject-specific training. A hose team training to fight an aircraft fire aboard a US aircraft carrier, 2006 Examples are: *Fire apparatus driver/operator - trained to drive fire apparatus to and from fires and other emergencies, operate fire-apparatus pumps and aerial devices, and maintain apparatus. *Hazardous materials technician - certified to mitigate hazardous materials and CBRNE emergencies. *Rescue technician - certified to perform rescues such as high-angle rope, trench, structural collapse, confined space, vehicle and machinery, water, ice, and cave or mine rescues. *Airport firefighter - trained in ARFF. *Wildland firefighter - trained to extinguish fires in outdoor vegetation, including the wildland/urban interface. = Shift hours = Full-time career firefighters typically follow a 24-hour shift schedule, although some fire departments work 8 or 12 hour shifts. Australian firefighters work a 10/14 shift, in which the day shift works ten hours and the night shift works 14 hours. Firefighting personnel are split up into alternating shifts. Usually, the 24 hour shifts are followed by two days off. The shift personnel arrive for roll call at a specified time, ready to complete a regular tour of duty. While on shift, the firefighter remains at the fire station unless relieved or assigned other duties. =Fire wardens= A fire warden poster, circa 1940s. In fire fighting, there are also people designated as fire wardens, also known as the chief officer. Their duties vary, some may ensure evacuation of that part of the building for which they are responsible; others may be responsible for fire control in a particular area, direct a crew in the suppression of forest fires, or function as fire patrolmen in a logging area. The chief officer is in charge of his firefighters during fires or emergencies, and he is expected to command and control the overall situation while effectively combating a fire or other emergency. Chief officers must be able to evaluate their firefighters, use sound judgement when deciding when it is time to withdraw firefighters from a fire, and react calmly in emergency situations. The chief officer must direct the activities of a fire department and supervise all firefighting activities. In addition, he must have extensive knowledge of the city, the location of streets, fire hydrants and fire alarm boxes, and the principal buildings. Also he must have knowledge of explosives, hazardous chemicals, and the combustion qualities of materials in buildings, homes, and industrial plants. In certain jurisdictions, civilians can get certified to be a Fire Warden, and some cities require certain types of buildings, such as high rises, to have a certain number of Fire Wardens. For example, the City of Houston, Texas, requires every tenant in a high-rise to have at least one Fire Warden for every 7500 sq. ft. occupied, and a minimum of two Fire Wardens per floor.Fire Warden Certification Classes - City of Houston - In this example, their duties include investigating any fire alarms (see if there really is a fire and if so, its nature), ensuring the fire department is contacted, directing the evacuation of the facility, activating or delaying activation of fire suppression equipment such as halon and sprinklers (delayed in case of a false alarm), meeting the fire department and taking them to the location of the alarm or to the fire past any security or locked doors, and, if necessary, fighting the fire until the fire department arrives. Hazards caused by fire = During a fire = Structure fire in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US One of the major hazards associated with firefighting operations is the toxic environment created by combusting materials. The four major hazards are: *Smoke, which is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the increased variety and amount of synthetic household materials *Oxygen deficient atmosphere (21% O2 is normal and 19.5% O2 is considered oxygen deficient) *Elevated temperatures *Toxic atmospheres To deal with such hazards, firefighters carry a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA; an open-circuit positive pressure system) to prevent smoke inhalation. These are not oxygen tanks (oxygen as a powerful fire accelerant would represent a grave risk when combined with virtually anything combustible in the presence of fire) but use compressed air in a similar manner to SCUBA diving gear. A firefighter's SCBA usually hold 30 to 45 minutes of air, depending on the size of the tank and the rate of consumption during strenuous activities. While this gear helps to eliminate the risks, firefighters are still exposed to smoke, toxic dust, fumes and radiation that have contributed to firefighters being 14% more likely to develop cancer. Obvious risks associated with the immense heat generated by a fire, even without direct contact with the flames (direct flame impingement), such as conductive heat and radiant heat, can cause serious burns even from great distances. There are a number of comparably serious heat-related risks, such as burns from hot gases (e.g., air), steam, and hot and/or toxic smoke. Prolonged, intense exertion in hot environments also increases firefighters' risk for health-related illnesses, such as rhabdomyolysis. Accordingly, firefighters are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) that includes fire-resistant clothing such as Nomex or polybenzimidazole fiber (PBI) and helmets that limit the transmission of heat towards the body. No PPE, however, can completely protect the user from the effects of all possible fire conditions. Heat can cause flammable liquid contained in tanks to explode violently, producing what is called a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).Thomson Delmar Learning. The Firefighter's Handbook: Essentials of Fire Fighting and Emergency Response. Second Edition. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Publishers, 2004. Some chemical products such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers can also explode, potentially causing physical trauma from blast or shrapnel injuries. Sufficient heat causes human flesh to burn as fuel, or the water within to boil, leading to potentially severe medical problems. Depending on the heat of the fire, burns can occur in a fraction of a second. Additional risks of fire are the obscuring of vision due to smoke, potentially causing a fall or disorientation; becoming trapped in a fire; and structural collapse. \\"Three hours of fighting a fire stiffens arteries and impairs cardiac function in firefighters\\" according to a new study by Bo Fernhall, a professor in the department of kinesiology and community health in the College of Applied Health Sciences, and Gavin Horn, director of research at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The conditions (observed in healthy male firefighters) are \\"also apparent found in weightlifters and endurance athletes...\\" = During debris cleanup = Once extinguished, fire debris cleanup poses several safety and health risks for workers. Many hazardous substances are commonly found in fire debris. Silica can be found in concrete, roofing tiles, or it may be a naturally occurring element. Occupational exposures to silica dust can cause silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, airway diseases, and some additional non-respiratory diseases. Inhalation of asbestos can result in various diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Sources of metals exposure include burnt or melted electronics, cars, refrigerators, stoves, etc. Fire debris cleanup workers may be exposed to these metals or their combustion products in the air or on their skin. These metals may include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and many more. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are carcinogenic, come from the incomplete combustion of organic materials and are often found as a result of structural and wildland fires.IARC 2002 Safety hazards of fire cleanup include the risk of reignition of smoldering debris, electrocution from downed or exposed electrical lines or in instances where water has come into contact with electrical equipment. Structures that have been burned may be unstable and at risk of sudden collapse. Standard personal protective equipment for fire cleanup include hard hats, goggles or safety glasses, heavy work gloves, earplugs or other hearing protection, steel-toe boots, and fall protection devices. Hazard controls for electrical injury include assuming all power lines are energized until confirmation they are de-energized, and grounding power lines to guard against electrical feedback, and using appropriate personal protective equipment. Proper respiratory protection can protect against hazardous substances. Proper ventilation of an area is an engineering control that can be used to avoid or minimize exposure to hazardous substances. When ventilation is insufficient or dust cannot be avoided, personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators can be used. Reconnaissance and \\"reading\\" the fire The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire (which may not be obvious for an indoor fire, especially if there are no witnesses), to identify any specific risks, and to detect possible casualties. An outdoor fire may not require reconnaissance, but a fire in a cellar or an underground car park with only a few centimeters of visibility may require long reconnaissance to identify the source of the fire. The \\"reading\\" of a fire is the analysis by firefighters of indications of thermal events such as flashover, backdraft or smoke explosion. It is performed during reconnaissance and fire suppression maneuvers. The main signs are: * Hot zones, which can be detected with a gloved hand, for example by touching a door before opening it; * Soot on windows, which usually means that combustion is incomplete, and thus, a lack of air in the room; * Smoke pulsing in and out around a door frame, as if the fire were breathing, which usually also means a lack of air to support combustion. Spraying water on the ceiling in short pulses of a diffused spray (e.g., a cone with an opening angle of 60¬∞) can be undertaken to test the heat of smoke: If the temperature is moderate, the water falls down in drops with a sound like rain; if the temperature is high, the water vaporizes with a hiss‚Äîthe sign of a potentially extremely dangerous impending flashover. Ideally, part of reconnaissance is consulting a plan for the building that provides information about structures, firefighter hazards, and in some cases the most appropriate strategies and tactics for fighting a fire in that context.  Science of extinguishment  fire helicopter is used to fight a wildfire There are four elementsHall, Richard. Essentials of Fire Fighting. Fourth Edition. Stillwater, OK: Fire Protection Publications, 1998: needed to start and sustain a fire and/or flame. These are a reducing agent (fuel), heat, an oxidizing agent (oxygen), and a chemical reaction. A fire can be extinguished by taking away any of the four components. The fuel is the substance being oxidized or burned in the combustion process. The most common fuels contain carbon along with combinations of hydrogen and oxygen. Heat is the energy component of a fire. When it comes into contact with a fuel, it provides the energy necessary for ignition, causes the continuous production and ignition of fuel vapors or gases so that the combustion reaction can continue, and causes the vaporization of solid and liquid fuels. The resulting self-sustained chemical chain reaction is complex and requires fuel, an oxidizer, and heat energy to come together in a very specific way. An oxidizing agent is a material or substance that will release gases, including oxygen, when the proper conditions exist. It is crucial to the sustainment of a flame or fire. Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water‚Äôs ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam. Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish. One final extinguishing method is chemical flame inhibition. This can be accomplished by applying dry chemical or halogenated agents that interrupt the chemical chain reaction and stop flaming. This method is effective on gas and liquid fuel because they must have flame to burn. Sound waves have been successfully used in a device fabricated by two George Mason University senior engineering students, Viet Tran and Seth Robertson, but the procedure is still awaiting a patent (2015). Use of water USMC firefighters neutralize a fire during a training exercise A firefighting aircraft dumping water on a forest fire in South Africa. One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by \\"jumping\\" to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of \\"asphyxia\\" (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area. Water may be accessed from a pressurized fire hydrant, pumped from water sources such as lakes or rivers, delivered by tanker truck, or dropped from water bombers, which are aircraft adapted as tankers for fighting forest fires. An armored vehicle (firefighting tank) may be used where access to the area is difficult. = Open air fire = For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the \\"asphyxia\\" caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack. An outdoor fire is always fed with air, and the risk to people is limited as they can move away from it, except in the case of wildfires or bushfires where they risk being easily surrounded by the flames. It might, however, be necessary to protect specific objects like houses or gas tanks against infrared radiation, and thus to use a diffused spray between the fire and the object. Breathing apparatus is often required as there is still the risk of inhaling smoke or poisonous gases. = Closed volume fire = Iranian firefighters had to extinguish the fire at Bistoon Petrochemicals Powerhouse Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover. Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters. When a fire spreads beyond the building of its origin and spreads throughout the neighborhood, it is called a ‚Äúconflagration.‚Äù Today, a conflagration is a large fire that is beyond the capability of the fire service to contain. The volume of the fire must be cooled before its seat is attacked. This strategy, originally of Swedish origin (Mats Rosander & Krister Giselsson), was adapted by London Fire Officer Paul Grimwood following a decade of operational use in the busy West End of London between 1984 and 1994 and termed the three- dimensional or 3D attack. Use of a diffuse spray was first proposed by Chief Lloyd Layman of the Parkersburg Fire Department, at the 1950 Fire Department Instructors Conference (FDIC) held in Memphis. Using Grimwood's modified 3D attack strategy, the ceiling is first sprayed with short pulses of a diffuse spray. This cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles's law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a \\"backfire\\" of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert \\"water vapor sky\\", which prevents \\"roll-over\\" (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases). Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters. An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air (\\"penciling\\"). Modern methods for extinguishing an urban fire dictate the use of a massive initial water flow, e.g. 500 L/min for each fire hose. The aim is to absorb as much heat as possible at the beginning to stop the expansion of the fire and to reduce the smoke. If the flow is too low, the cooling is insufficient, and the steam that is produced can burn firefighters (the drop of pressure is too small and the vapor is pushed back in their direction). Although it may seem paradoxical, the use of a strong flow with an efficient fire hose and an efficient strategy (diffuse spray, small droplets) requires a smaller amount of water. This is because once the temperature is lowered, only a limited amount of water is necessary to suppress the fire seat with a straight spray. For a living room of , the required amount of water is estimated as 60 L (15 gal). French firefighters used an alternative method in the 1970s: spraying water on the hot walls to create a water vapor atmosphere and asphyxiate the fire. This method is no longer used because it turned out to be risky; the pressure created pushed the hot gases and vapor towards the firefighters, causing severe burns, and pushed the hot gases into other rooms where they could start other fires. Asphyxiating a fire In some cases, the use of water is undesirable. This is because some chemical products react with water to produce poisonous gases, or they may even burn when they come into contact with water (e.g., sodium), see water-reactive substances. Another problem is that some products float on water, such as hydrocarbons (gasoline, oil, and alcohol, etc.); a burning layer can then be spread by the fire. If a pressurized fuel tank is endangered by fire it is necessary to avoid heat shocks that may damage the tank if it is sprayed with cooling water; the resulting decompression might produce a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). Electrical fires cannot be extinguished with water since the water could act as a conductor. In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there. Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation. Paul Grimwood introduced the concept of tactical ventilation in the 1980s to encourage a better thought-out approach to this aspect of firefighting. Following work with Warrington Fire Research Consultants (FRDG 6/94) his terminology and concepts were adopted officially by the UK fire services, and are now referred to throughout revised Home Office training manuals (1996‚Äì97). Grimwood's original definition of his 1991 unified strategy stated that, \\"tactical ventilation is either the venting, or containment (isolation) actions by on-scene firefighters, used to take control from the outset of a fire's burning regime, in an effort to gain tactical advantage during interior structural firefighting operations.\\" When properly used, ventilation improves life safety, fire extinguishment, and property conservation by 'pulling' fire away from trapped occupants and objects. In most cases of structural firefighting, a 4x4 foot opening is cut into the roof directly over the fire room. This allows hot smoke and gases to escape through the opening, returning the conditions inside the room to normal. It is important to coordinate the ventilation with an interior fire attack since the opening of a ventilation hole supplies more air, and thus oxygen, to the fire. Ventilation may also \\"limit fire spread by channeling fire toward nearby openings and allows fire fighters to safely attack the fire\\" as well as limit smoke, heat, and water damage.Bernard Klaene. Structural Firefighting: Strategies and Tactics. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2007. , Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) consists of using a fan to create excess pressure in a part of the building. This pressure pushes the smoke and heat out of the building, and thus facilitates rescue and fire fighting operations. It is necessary to have an exit for the smoke, to know the building layout well to predict where the smoke will go, and to ensure that the doors ensuring the ventilation remain open by wedging or propping them. The main risk of this method is that it may accelerate the fire, or even create a flash-over; for example, if the smoke and the heat accumulate in a dead end. Hydraulic ventilation is the process of directing a stream of water from the inside of a structure out the window using a fog pattern. This will effectively pull smoke out of room. Smoke ejectors may also be used for this purpose. Categorizing fires =United States= In the US, fires are sometimes categorized as \\"one alarm\\", \\"all hands\\", \\"two alarm\\", \\"three alarm\\" (or higher) fires. There is no standard definition for what this means quantifiably; though, it always refers to the level of response by the local authorities. In some cities, the numeric rating refers to the number of fire stations that have been summoned to the fire. In others, it reflects the number of \\"dispatches\\" requesting additional personnel and equipment. Alarms levels are generally used to define the tiers of the response as to what resources are to be used. For example, a structure fire response draws the following equipment: four engine/pumper companies, one truck/ladder/aerial/quint company, and one battalion chief unit. This is referred to as an Initial Alarm or Box Alarm. A working fire request (for the same incident) would call for air/light units and chief officers/fireground commanders (if not provided in the original dispatch). This summarizes the response to a First Alarm fire. Second and subsequent alarms call for two engine companies and one truck company. The reason behind the \\"Alarm\\" designation is so the Incident Commander does not have to list each apparatus required. He can simply say, \\"Give me a second alarm here\\", instead of \\"Give me a truck company and two engine companies\\" along with requesting where they should come from. Categorization of fires varies among fire departments. A single alarm for one department may be a second alarm for another. Response always depends on the size of the fire and the department. =United Kingdom= In the fire services in the United Kingdom, the scale of a fire is measured by the number of \\"pumps\\" (ordinary fire engines) that were present. For example, a fire which was attended by 4 engines would be recorded as a \\"4-pump fire\\".Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, Operational Note 3 (in the public domain, accessed 22 May 2007) Fireman!

In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation, now Dell EMC, and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum. In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology. According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry \\"Big 5's list\\", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi. According to Gartner's 2018 Magic Quadrant for Solid- State Arrays, NetApp was named a leader, behind Pure Storage Systems. In 2019, Gartner named NetApp as #1 in Primary Storage. Products NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage. ActiveIQ comes to NetApp with the acquisition of SolidFire. ActiveIQ is SaaS portal with built- in monitoring, prediction, recommendations for optimizing configurations and performance for NetApp storage systems based on machine-learning capabilities and artificial intelligence. Later ONTAP Analytics and Telemetry Service (OATS) product, which can be installed in AWS cloud and on-premise, was renamed to Active IQ Performance Analytics Services (ActiveIQ PAS). =NetApp ONTAP-based Hardware Appliances= NetApp FAS3240 (second from bottom) with three DS4243 shelves on top NetApp AFF A800 with 48 NVMe SSD drives NetApp's FAS (Fabric-Attached Storage), AFF (All-Flash FAS), and ASA (All SAN Array) storage systems are the company's flagship products. Such products are made up of storage controllers, and one or more enclosures of hard disks, known as shelves. In entry-level systems, the drives may be physically located in the storage controller itself. In the early 1990s, NetApp's storage systems initially offered NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well, supporting the Fiber Channel and iSCSI protocols. NetApp systems support Fibre Channel, iSCSI, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and the FC-NVMe protocol. =ONTAP= NetApp AFF, FAS, ONTAP Select, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Volume Services, Lenovo DM storage system series use NetApp's proprietary operating system called ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems. There are three ONTAP platforms: FAS/AFF systems, software on commodity servers (ONTAP Select) as virtual machine or in the cloud (Cloud Volumes ONTAP). All ONTAP systems are using WAFL file systems which provide basis for snapshots and other snapshot-based and data protection technologies. =Cloud Backup= Previously known as Riverbed SteelStor before its acquisition by NetApp, this product was later renamed to AltaVault and then to Cloud Backup. Cloud Backup was initially available in three forms: as a hardware appliance, virtual appliance, and cloud appliance. Later NetApp announced the end of sale for hardware and virtual appliances. Data placed on NAS share on Cloud Backup deduplicated, compressed, encrypted and transferred with Object Protocols to object storage systems like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage or StorageGRID; thus Cloud Backup appears as a transparent gateway for archiving data to a private or public cloud. =NetApp HCI= NetApp HCI: two 2U HCI Chassis with four half-width blade servers at the bottom and one 1U storage node at the top NetApp Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) or sometimes referred by NetApp as Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure. NetApp HCI is based on commodity blade and rack servers, NetApp Element software and VMware vSphere. NetApp HCI includes web- based GUI with installation wizard called NetApp Deployment Engine (NDE) for configuring vCenter, IP addresses, login & password, and storage nodes, install NetApp Element plugin in vCenter to manage storage and configure NetApp HCI in about 30 minutes according to NetApp. NetApp HCI is different than conventional HCI designs because it has dedicated storage nodes, while other HCI systems like Dell EMC VxRail or vSAN do not have dedicated storage nodes and utilize disk drives installed in each server. Dedicated storage nodes allow the cluster to grow or decrease storage capacity and performance separately from compute nodes. Minimum NetApp HCI configuration requires two compute blade server nodes and additionally, Element software requires a minimum of 4 storage nodes but is available to customers as four physical storage nodes or two physical storage nodes and two nodes as a virtual machine playing witness role on compute nodes. 2U HCI Chassis with four half-width blade servers NetApp HCI, two 2U HCI Chassis Each storage node drive set consists of 6 SSD drives directly connected to a dedicated storage node and installed in front of the blade chassis. Each storage and compute blade nodes have 25 Gigabit Ethernet ports which could be used as 10Gbit/s ports as well as dedicated 1Gb ports for management purposes. Network switches were not included, and in NetApp HCI with Element software release 11 NetApp announced H-Series Switch as part of HCI solution, so all hardware components must be bought from NetApp. ONTAP Select available as SDS on NetApp HCI for customers interested in NAS protocols. The self-service portal allows automating common provisioning and management tasks without involving the IT team. NetApp Kuberneties Service will support NetApp HCI with the acquisition of Stackpoint. NetApp SolidFire storage and NetApp HCI can be expanded & mixed in a single cluster. At the NetApp Insight 2018 conference in Las Vegas NetApp presented two new compute nodes: H410C and H610C, where H610C includes additional GPU cards which can be used in VDI environments. Starting with Element OS version 11, automatically detected and enabled by default with the upgrade, HCI has Protection Domains functionality to provide resiliency into HCI chassis. In the case of maintenance or chassis failure, helix algorithm spans data blocks workload will automatically fail-over to another operational chassis. SolidFire SolidFire storage system uses OS called NetApp Element Software (formally SolidFire Element OS) based on Linux and designed for SSDs and scale-out architecture with the ability to expand up to 100 nodes and provide access to data through SAN protocols iSCSI natively and Fiber Channel with two gateway nodes. Element OS provides a REST-based API for storage automation, configuration, management, and consumption. SF node H610S has 12 2.5\\" NVMe SSD drives and can install only Element version 10.4, while previous models have 10 SSD drives. Element SW version 11, will not support FC. SolidFire uses iSCSI login redirection to distribute reads and writes across the cluster using helix algorithm. This architecture does not have disk shelves like traditional storage systems and expands with adding nodes to the cluster. Each node has pre-installed SSD drives. Each node can have only one type of SSD drives with the same capacity. Each SolidFire cluster can have a mix of different node models & generations. Element X uses the replication factor of 2, where blocks of data spread across the cluster which has no performance impact but require more space in contrary to Erasure Coding technology. Such architecture allows users to expand performance and capacity separately as needed. Also, SolidFire has the ability to set three types of QoS for its LUNs: minimum, maximum and burst. Burst is used as credits which were not used by the LUN while it was not received its maximums. Element X available as software-only on commodity servers. SolidFire systems using S3 protocol could backup data to an Object storage systems like StorageGRID. SolidFire could replicate data with SnapMirror protocol to ONTAP systems and starting with Element OS 11 to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. VEEAM backup & Replication 9.5 Update 4 will implement seamless integration with NetApp HCI and Solidfire provide application consistent storage snapshot capabilities, Instant VM Recovery, and Single Item Restore for some applications. CommVault Simpana also provides application-consistent storage snapshot capability for NetApp HCI and Solidfire. All HCI configurations require at list 4 10/25 Gbit/s ports for connections until Element OS 11, where two ports are enough. =StorageGRID= NetApp SG6060 StorageGRID Webscale StorageGRID is a software-defined storage system which provides access to data via object IP- based protocols like S3 and OpenStack Swift. Available in form of hardware or as software. A node in a StorageGRID cluster is an appliance, virtual machine or docker container. StorageGRID is a geo-dispersed namespace clustered storage system, also known as \\"the grid\\", with an ability to make and store multiple copies (replicas) of objects (also known as Replication Factor) or in Erasure Coding (EC) manner among cluster storage nodes with object granularity based on configured policies for data availability and durability purposes. StorageGRID stores metadata separately from the objects and allows users to configure data Life Cycle Management (ILM) policies on a per-object level to automatically satisfy and confirm changes in the cluster once changes introduced to the cluster like the cost of network usage, storage media usage changes a node was added or removed, etc. ONTAP, Cloud Backup, SANtricity, and Element X can replicate data to StorageGRID systems. SG6060 is optimized for high transactional throughput, MA, AI, and FabricPool.  StorageGRID on NetApp HCI  Solution Deployment of StorageGRID on NetApp HCI which can be deployed in three forms: Fully contained; High performance and scale; NetApp HCI and StorageGRID appliance. =E-Series= E5700 with 60 disk drives enclosure RAID comparison with DDP DDP components and data reconstruction process Previously known as LSI Engenio RDAC after NetApp acquisition the product renamed to NetApp E-Series. It is a general-purpose enterprise storage system with two controllers for SAN protocols such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, SAS and InfiniBand (includes SRP, iSER, and NVMe over Fabrics protocol). NetApp E-Series platform uses proprietary OS SANtricity and proprietary RAID called Dynamic Disk Pool (DDP) alongside with traditional RAIDs like RAID 10, RAID 6, RAID 5, etc. In DDP pool each D-Stripe works similar to traditional RAID-4 and RAID-6 but on block level instead of entire disk level, therefore, have no dedicated parity drives. DDP compare to traditional RAID groups restores data from lost disk drive to multiple drives which provide a few times faster reconstruction time while traditional RAIDs restores lost disk drive to a dedicated parity drive. Starting with SANtricity 11.50 E-Series systems EF570 and E5700 support NVMe over Ethernet (RoCEv2) with 100Gbit/s Ethernet ports and NVMe over InfiniBand. Starting with EF600 systems are end- to-end NVMe and capable of NVMe/FC in addition to NVMe/RoCE & NVMe/InfiniBand. Sync and async mirroring are supported with SANtricity 11.50. SANtricity Unified Manager is a web-based manager that supports up to 500 EF/E-Series arrays and supports LDAP, RBAC, CA & SSL for authorization & authentication. In August 2019 NetApp announced E600 with support for NVMe/IB, NVMe/RoCE, NVMe/FC protocols, up to 44GBps of bandwidth and full-function embedded REST API. =Converged Infrastructure= FlexPod, nFlex and ONTAP AI are commercial names for Converged Infrastructure (CI). Converged Infrastructures are joint products of a few vendors and consists from 3 main hardware components: computing servers, switches (in some cases switches are not necessary) and NetApp storage systems: * FlexPod based on Cisco Servers and Cisco Nexus switches * nFlex based on Fujitsu Servers with Extreme Networks switching * ONTAP AI using NVIDIA supercomputers with Melanox or Cisco Nexus switches.

Combined technical support provided to the customers to all the architecture components. =OnCommand Insight= OnCommand Insight (OCI) is data center management software, capacity management, infrastructure analytics, centralized view into historical trends to forecast performance and capacity requirements and workload placement. OCI works with all NetApp storage systems and with competitor storage systems and in public cloud. Licensed server-based software. =Memory Accelerated Data= NetApp MAX Data for short. MAX Data is a proprietary Linux file system with auto-tiering from PMEM to SSD and some enterprise data protection features. NetApp officially announced MAX Data product availability at NetApp Insight 2018 in October, supported with RHEL Server 7.5, CentOS 7.5, CentOS 7.6, RHEL Server 7.6 and RHEL Server 7.7; With version 1.2 MAX Data supports in-guest VM configuration for VMware vShpere starting with 6.7 U2 and in-guest iSCSI connection. Also, NetApp did some KVM testing while containers are in the long-term support roadmap. MAX Data also can be run in the cloud, but currently, not supported. Starting with MAX Data 1.5 supported FAS & ONTAP Select storages, also snapshots on server-only configurations supported. MAX Data came from the acquisition of Plexistor company in May 2017, Plexistor was founded in 2013 and positioned for Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning & Machine Learning, Fraud Prevention/Banking), Real-Time Analytics/Trading Platforms, Data Warehouse, IoT workloads and database applications like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Oracle DB, Java Environment databases, Spark, etc. but can run any applications which can use MAX Data file system. SAP HANA is currently qualifying whether MAX Data is suitable for the application but not supported yet. Technology explanation MAX Data consists of two tiers: Tier 1 and Tier 2, where cold data destaged to Tier 2 from Tier 1 or promoted from Tier 2 to Tier 1 when accessed, by MAX Data tiering algorithm, transparently to the applications. Currently, NetApp has recommended ratio for MAX Data as 1 to 25 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 respectively. MAX Data according to NetApp will have two modes: to use MAX Data as a POSIX-compatible (the internal name is M1FS) file system or as API memory extension. Usage of MAX Data as POSIX FS does not require application modifications while API memory extension requires applications to be modified in order to utilize this functionality. MAX Data installed on Linux hosts to utilize ultra-low latency with persistent memory such as the Optane DC persistent memory (Optane DCPMM), NVDIMM or DRAM (when persistence not needed, for example for testing purposes) memory for Tier 1 and a NetApp AFF storage system for Tier 2. Optane DCPMM is the Intel brand name of products that use 3D XPoint technology and supported starting with MAX Data version 1.3. MAX FS is a Persistent Memory-based Filesystem (PM-based FS) that doesn't require application modification but also can be a Direct Access enabled File system (DAX-enabled FS) for applications with optimization for Persistent Memory using SPDK. DAX is the mechanism that enables direct access to files stored in persistent memory arrays without the need to copy the data through the page cache. Optane DCPMM requires to have the second generation of Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. MAX FS based on ZUFS (Zero-copy User-mode File System) interface for the user-space file system and does not need a dedicated kernel module, in comparison to filesystems like NTFS based on FUSE, or XFS & EXT4 directly connected to vfs, and therefore each FS require its kernel module. ZUFS operating in Linux userspace and consisting out of two modules called zuf (Zu Feeder) & zus (Zu Server) available as OpenSource; zuf is a kernel to userspace bridge. MAX Data used as Memory Extension is NUMA aware, byte-addressable near-memory latency (3-10 microseconds), optimized for random I/O, persistent memory and as FUSE-based filesystems do not have a page caching. MAX Data is integrated with NetApp ONTAP as part of Data Fabric vision. Currently, MAX Data works over SAN (FC & iSCSI) with AFF systems on the back end or SSD drives installed in the same server (starting with MAX Data 1.4), but NetApp considering to add: FC-NVMe protocol already available in ONTAP, iNVMe (NVMe over TCP) which is currently not supported by ONTAP, and NAS protocols which not supported yet but were tested on MAX Data with SDS instances of ONTAP, i.e., ONTAP Select and NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP according to Tech ONTAP podcast 154 on SoundCloud. NetApp is also looking into integration MAX Data with ONTAP FlexCache functionality for NFS caching in the long run. Also, NetApp tested MAX Data with Element OS but currently needs some server-side modifications and not supported. MAX Data provides persistent memory capabilities and include data protection capabilities like snapshots (MAX Snap) and SVM SnapMirror, Cloning, Data Tiering, and MAX Recovery found as a key functionality by enterprise companies running In-memory processing applications. MAX Recovery is technology copying data from memory of one (primary) server over RoCE network to memory of another (recovery) server, which allows recovering back to the original primary server data in seconds compared to hours if it were done from SSD media. For cluster connection for MAX Recovery, NetApp recommends using a dedicated RDMA over Ethernet (RoCEv2) 100Gbit/s network (also referred to as Persistent Memory over Fabrics, PMoF) which takes additionally 2-3 microseconds compare to single-node configurations. MAX Snap is a snapshot on MAX Data (Tier 1) level which can call another MAX Data service called Sync Snap to synchronize snapshot on Tier 2 so snapshot on storage system will capture and merge data into coherent, consistent snapshot on the storage system which later can be replicated with SnapMirror. MAX Data have APIs for application-consistent snapshots and plans to add functionality to integrate it with SnapCenter, but currently, doesn't have data protection software integrations. MAX Data have a 3-month release cadence. MAX Data Memory API allows new applications to integrate with MAX Data for application-based and potentially more intelligent memory management, therefore it needs application modification while MAX Data with data tiering algorithm does not need any application modifications if used as the POSIX file system. MAX Data have Pin functionality which can pin a file or a certain range within a file so it will not be going to destaged into the second tier. According to the Yahoo, Cloud Serving Benchmark showed on Tech Field Day on October 24, 2018, MAX Data reaching 3.7 more IOPS and 4-5 times less latency, compared to Linux XFS on NVMe flash in AWS EC2 instance and 64GB memory (with 32GB cache size for MongoDB) with 50% read modify write workload. MAX data have a per-server license and do not depend on CPU, Memory or storage capacity. MAX Data has two different licensing tiers: Basic and Advanced. Advanced licensing includes enterprise capabilities like snapshots, MAX Recovery, while Basic used only if performance with tiering functionality needed. Cloud Business Cloud Central is a web-based GUI interface that provides a multi-cloud application orchestration layer and single pane of glass based on Qstack for NetApp's cloud products like Cloud Volumes Service, Cloud Sync, Cloud Insights, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, SaaS Backup in multiple public cloud providers. NetApp offers some of its original or modified products as part of its Cloud portfolio alongside new cloud-native products. For example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, NPS is re-purposed for use in the cloud, while others are cloud-native. Netapp Cloud business, offerings, and products available on http://cloud.netapp.com portal. Cloud Manager is a service for high-level management of ONTAP-based systems on-premise and in the cloud: CVO, CVS, ONTAP Select, FAS, and AFF. Cloud Manager allows to quickly setup SnapMirror data protection replication between systems through the GUI interface with drag-and-drop manner. =Cloud Volumes On-Prem= It is a storage system installed on-premises in a customer's data center and available to the customer as service. All work for updates & technical support provided by NetApp while the customer consumes space from the storage using web-based GUI or API and performs data backup and replication if needed. Cloud Volumes ONTAP Formally ONTAP Cloud. Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) is software- defined (SDS) version of ONTAP available in some public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. Cloud Volumes ONTAP is a virtual machine which is using commodity equipment and running ONTAP software as a service. Cloud Volumes Service Is service in Amazon AWS & Google Cloud public cloud provider based on NetApp All-Flash FAS systems and ONTAP software, therefore will be able to synchronize data between cloud and on- premises NetApp systems. NetApp claims they will provide similar to AFF systems persistent performance SLA and also claims data could be moved in a way that will not generate huge ingress and egress charges using SnapMirror technology. Cloud Volumes Service will provide high availability for data with next protocols that can be consumed by containers: NFS v3, NFS v4, and SMB. Cloud Volumes Service support NetApp's Snapshots. The current maximum for Cloud Volumes Service is 100TB. In the Azure cloud currently only NFS available and called Azure NetApp Files. Cloud Volumes Service available as service in corresponding public cloud providers directly through their Marketplaces. NetApp claims them as reliable enterprise NAS services as in on- premises enterprise-grade data storage with predictable performance, management, security, and protection. NAS integrates with some other services in the public cloud providers. RESTful APIs will be available to automate NAS storage services such as provisioning, snapshots, and SnapMirror. =NetApp Private Storage= NetApp Private Storage (NPS) is based on Equinix partner provided colocation service in its data centers for NetApp Storage Systems with 10 Gbit/s direct connection to public cloud providers like Azure and AWS etc. Some of Equinix data centers located in the same building with public cloud providers thus network connectivity to a dedicated storage system is the same as with a storage service in a public cloud provider. Such configuration provides better performance compare to storage service in public cloud provider based on sharable commodity hardware and help to fit some companies with regulatory compliances which require strict data placement, security, availability and disaster recovery which public cloud provider could not provide. NPS storage could be connected to a few cloud providers or on-premise infrastructure, thus in case of switching between clouds does not require data migration between them. =Astra= Astra is NetApp's Kubernetes cloud service for consistent application-consistent backups, Data Cloning, and data mobility across clouds and on-premises. Project Astra unlocks the power of Kubernetes to accelerate developer agility, drive business productivity and enhance IT operational efficiencies. Astra can deploy and maintain data-rich applications with choice of Kubernetes, across choices of leading public clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and on-premises datacenters, enabling easily backup and restoring data or migrating the applications from one Kubernetes cluster to another in a multi-cloud environment. =SaaS Backup= NetApp SaaS Backup (Previously Cloud Control) is back up and recovery service for SaaS Microsoft Office 365 and Salesforce which provide extended, granular and custom retention capabilities of backup and recovery process compare to native cloud backup. NetApp planning to extend SaaS Backup and recovery service for Google Apps (G Suite), Slack and ServiceNow. =Cloud Sync= Cloud Sync is service for synchronizing any NAS storage system with another NAS storage, an Object Storage like Amazon S3 or NetApp Storage GRID using an object protocol. =Cloud Insights= SaaS application for monitoring infrastructure application stack for customers consuming cloud resources and also build for the dynamic nature of microservices and web-scale infrastructures. Cloud Insights uses similar to OnCommand Insight front-end API but different technology on the back-end. Cloud Insights available as a preview and will have three editions: Free, Standard and Premium. The free edition will be able to monitor NetApp storage & services using NetApp Active IQ at no cost. Cloud Secure Cloud Secure is a SaaS security tool that identifies malicious data access and compromised users, in other words, user behavior analytics. It provides centralized visibility and control of all corporate data access across hybrid cloud environments for security and compliance goals. Cloud Secure using data collectors to identify security breaches not solvable by file access control where the user has legitimate access to files and require post-login detection to understand what is appropriate and what is bad behavior. Cloud Secure uses machine learning algorithms to identify the working community, abnormal user behavior and unusual patterns compare to other users. Cloud Secure can identify users been infected with ransomware generating abnormal change rates and prevent them from encrypting the files. Cloud Secure can take customizable actions to users identified with abnormal behavior, like quarantining the user. Currently supported data repositories: NetApp Cloud Volumes, NetApp ONTAP, NetApp StorageGRID, OneDrive, AWS, Google Suite, HPE, DELLEMC Isilon, Dropbox, Box, @workspace and Office 365. Currently available as a preview only. =NDAS= NetApp Data Availability Services with data protection in the cloud GUI. Cloud service currently located only in AWS but architecturally is cloud-agnostic and ready to be copied to other clouds like Google Cloud & Azure. NDAS is a target for backup, data protection and disaster recovery purposes from ONTAP storage. ONTAP systems starting with ONTAP 9.5 have a built-in proxy application that converting NetApp snapshots with WAFL data & metadata into the S3 format unlike FabricPool technology that stores only data in the object storage. Once data converted to S3 and delivered to the cloud, NDAS will discover newly transferred snapshots and create a searchable catalog of files that can be restored from the NDAS back to the original or an alternate location. Currently, NDAS has only one working backup schema: primary ONTAP system with ONTAP 9.x transferring data to secondary ONTAP 9.5 with SnapMirror; the secondary system has NDAS proxy which converting snapshots and transferring them to S3 into the cloud. NetApp is planning to add NDAS to primary storage as well later on with a newer ONTAP version. NDAS is one of the Data Fabric manifestations. =Cloud Compliance= =Fabric Orchestrator = Fabric Flows Fabric Advisor Data Fabric Often referred as \\"Data Fabric Story.\\" Variety of integrations between NetApp's products and ways of data mobility considered by NetApp as Data Fabric vision for the future of data management. Data Fabric defines the NetApp technology architecture for hybrid cloud and provides the next features: SnapMirror replication from SolidFire to ONTAP; SnapMirror replication from ONTAP to Cloud Backup; FabricPool tiering feature for de- staging cold data from ONTAP to StorageGRID, Amazon S3 or Azure Blob; Volume Encryption with FabricPool provide secure data storage and secure over the wire transfer of enterprise data in a cloud provider; SnapMirror between FAS, AFF, ONTAP Select and Cloud Volumes ONTAP; Archiving and DR to public cloud; CloudMirror feature in StorageGRID replicates from on-premise object storage to Amazon S3 storage and triggers some actions in AWS Cloud; SolidFire backup to StorageGRID or Amazon S3; Cloud Backup archiving to variety of object storage systems (including StorageGRID) or many cloud providers; CloudSync is replication of NAS data to object format and back; replication to Cloud Volumes Service; Data backup to on-premise storage from SaaS Backup; SANtricity Cloud Connector for block-based backup, copy, and restore of E-Series volumes to an S3, NetApp Data Availability Services for data protection from ONTAP to cloud S3 storage with backup, DR & data mining capabilities, etc. Other features as part of Data Fabric vision approach committed by NetApp to be implemented in future, like SnapMirror between ONTAP and E-Series; SnapCenter capabilities to expand to include SolidFire storage endpoints, NetApp MAX Data host filesystem tiering to and from ONTAP storage systems connected with NVMeoF, etc. Software Integrations NetApp products could be integrated with a variety of software products which gives some additional flexibility, features and built-in provisioning and self-service storage capabilities.

Apprenda could be integrated with OpenStack running on top of FlexPod. =Backup and Recovery= CommVault, Veeam and Veritas have integrations with ONTAP, SolidFire, Cloud Backup and E-Series leveraging storage capabilities like snapshots and cloning capabilities for testing backup copies and SnapMirror for Backup and Recovery (B&R;), Disaster Recovery (DR) and Data Archiving for improving restore time and number of recovery points (see RPO/RTO). Cloud Backup integrates with nearly all B&R; products for archiving capabilities since it is represented as ordinary NAS share for B&R; software. Backup and recovery software from competitor vendors like IBM Spectrum Protect, EMC NetWorker, HP Data Protector, Dell vRanger, Acronis Backup etc. also have some level of integrations with NetApp storage systems. =Enterprise Applications= NetApp systems can integrate with enterprise applications for backup purposes, cloning, provisioning, and other self-service storage features. Oracle DB can be connected using Direct NFS (dNFS) client build inside database app which will provide network performance, resiliency, load balancing for NFS protocol with ONTAP systems. Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL, IBM DB2, MySQL, Mongo DB, SAP HANA, MS Exchange, VMware vSphere, Citrix Xen, KVM integrate with NetApp systems for provisioning, cloning and additional backup and recovery build in capabilities like SnapShots, SnapVault and SnapMirror with variety of B&R; software including NetApp's SnapCenter and SnapCreator. Integration with such applications provides the ability to the instant cloning of data sets for test and development and self-service restore capabilities for application administrators and for end users. NetApp ONTAP systems could be integrated with VMware vSphere using NFS plugin for ESXi hosts which offloads some of the storage operations on the storage system. With VASA protocol NetApp systems can integrate for VMware VVol technology. Similarly to NFS plugin for ESXi, ONTAP systems support ODX functionality with Windows systems with file and block-based protocols for offloading data copying or moving processes to the storage system. =OpenStack= NetApp systems have integration with such open source projects as OpenStack Cinder for Block storage (SolidFire, ONTAP, E-Series, OnCommand Insight, Cloud Backup), OpenStack Manila for Shared file system (ONTAP, OnCommand Insight), Docker persistent volumes through Trident plugin (SolidFire, ONTAP, E-Series) and others. OEM IBM used to OEM NetApp FAS systems under its own brand known as IBM N-series and this partnership ended May 29, 2014. Dell OEM NetApp E-Series under its own name PowerVault MD. September 13, 2018, Lenovo and NetApp announced its technology partnership, so Lenovo OEM Netapp products under its own name: Lenovo ThinkSystem DE (using NetApp's EF & E-Series array technology), and ThinkSystem DM uses ONTAP software with Lenovo servers and supports FC-NVMe (analog for NetApp FAS & AFF systems). Vector Data builds rugged and carrier-grade versions of NetApp FAS, AFF, E-Series and SolidFire products with -48V DC power and other customizations under their Vault product line. Reception =Controversy= Syrian surveillance In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller. On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce \\"that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws\\", and that the file on the matter had been closed. Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents. The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology. Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits. =Accolades= NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.

It quickly became a media phenomenon and one of the first viral videos early in the second half of the 1990s.  History  The \\"Dancing Baby\\" phenomenon refers to a rendered animation of a baby performing a cha-cha type dance. It originated as a collection of experimental testing data and files, ultimately released in autumn of 1996 as a product sample source file (sk_baby.max) with the 3D character animation software product \\"Character Studio\\", used with 3D Studio Max (both products from Kinetix/Autodesk). The original sample source file was produced and prepared by the original Character Studio development team (Michael Girard, Susan Amkraut, John Chadwick, Paul Bloemink, John Hutchinson, Adam Felt) at Unreal Pictures and Kinetix/Autodesk, amongst several other sample files. The cha-cha animation was created using the \\"Biped\\" animation system of Character Studio by Robert Lurye and Michael Girard. The 3D model of a human baby was added later by the development team as one of the character \\"skins\\" for the rendered animation. The original \\"Toddler with Diaper\\" model #VP5653 was built by, and courtesy of, Viewpoint Datalabs, with the bulk of the skinning and rigging performed by John Chadwick using the \\"Physique\\" skin/deformation system in Character Studio, and final edits by John and members of the Autodesk development team. After the first pre-release application of the 3D baby model to the cha-cha animation (and from pre-release showings), Kinetix/Autodesk employees realized it was amusing to see a baby dance a cha-cha rather than just walk; this helped ensure the selection of the 'dancing baby' as a sample file for debut release of Character Studio and for demonstration videos in product promotion. The animation of the original dancing baby data consists of heavily researched and adapted physics models to automate animation along with interpolated manually animated keyframes that are generated and synthesized by the \\"Biped\\" system of the Character Studio product. Contrary to popular misconceptions, none of the original Dancing Baby animation data were created using motion capture. After the 3D source file was released to public with the Character Studio product (Autumn 1996) users and animators were able to render their own video clips of the 'original' animated dancing baby (sk_baby.max) and circulate these via the Compuserve (internet) forums, World Wide Web (commercial and private web sites), and in print ads and unrestricted e-mail. Such activity proliferated most significantly from mainstream (Windows users) royalty-free access to and user renderings of the 3D dancing baby source file for use on internet and in broadcast television via several news editorials, advertisements, and even comic programming in local, national (U.S), and various international markets. In late 1996, web developer John Woodell created a highly compressed animated gif from the source movie, as part of a demo of the movie-to-gif process. Woodell later published the gif to his employee web page of the Internet startup where he worked. The animated gif then proliferated to numerous other web sites, and later proceeded to show up in a broad array of mainstream media, including television dramas (e.g. Ally McBeal), commercial advertisements, and music videos between 1997‚Äì1998. In February 2020, a Twitter user under the alias JArmstrongArt not only rediscovered the original Dancing Baby file, but also converted the original animation into High Definition.  Modifications  Variations to the original animation were later produced by numerous animators by modifying the sk_baby.max sample file's animation or the baby model itself, including a \\"drunken baby\\", a \\"rasta baby\\", a \\"samurai baby\\", and others. However, none of these became as popular on the Internet as the original file, and most popular uses of Dancing Baby are virtually unchanged from the original character mesh and animation.  Appearances in mainstream media  The Dancing Baby animation spread quickly on popular web forums, individual web sites, international e-mail, demo videos, commercials, and eventually mainstream television. Awareness of the baby most significantly increased when it was featured on CBS, CNN, and Fox's Ally McBeal comic drama series. The animation was shown on several episodes of Ally McBeal as a recurring hallucination, suggesting a metaphor for the ticking of Ally's biological clock. On the show, it was accompanied by Blue Swede's cover of the B. J. Thomas song \\"Hooked on a Feeling.\\" Various commercial advertisements presented the Dancing Baby animation to international markets continuing the mainstream media attention. This particular manifestation of the video, bound to the song, is widely distributed and referred to as the \\"Ugachaka Baby\\" (or \\"Oogachaka Baby\\"). More examples of the Dancing Baby used in mainstream media are below. =Television, media, music and film= The Dancing Baby made constant appearances in trade shows, worldwide marketing media, and of course in mainstream media such as television, music videos, and later in film too: * Crash Designs Incorporated, a 1990s dot-com company, founded by father and son Jeffrey Ambrose and Michael Ambrose, was the first to sell Dancing Baby merchandise, including T-shirts, ties, boxers, and mouse pads through its e-commerce website. * In 1996, the original Character Studio dancing baby animation appeared in major trade show demo reels, including NAB, Siggraph, IBC, Game Developer Conference (GDC), E3, and others. * In 1996, the sequence appeared in Studio !K7 release 'X-Mix Electro Boogie', as soundtrack for the track 'Demented Spirit' by The Octagon Man. * In 1996 and 1997, the dancing baby animation appeared on various local television broadcasts, including news and tech editorials, and CBS syndicated stations. * The Dancing Baby's first appearance on Ally McBeal was in season one episode 12, \\"Cro-Magnon\\", airing on January 5, 1998. * At the height of the Ally McBeal series, a dance group called Trubble released a song called Dancing Baby (Ooga-Chaka) which charted well in Australia in late 1998/early 1999 and reached No. 21 on the UK charts. * The Dancing Baby appeared on an episode of Unhappily Ever After, with Dennis Franz as the baby. * It was parodied in the opening of The House that Dick Built, episode 15 from the 4th season of 3rd Rock from the Sun, with Harry Solomon (French Stewart) as the baby. * In the parody wrestling series Celebrity Deathmatch, during a match between Lucy Lawless and Calista Flockhart (the actress who played Ally McBeal), the dancing baby suddenly appears in the ring with his back turned to the camera. After a moment of dancing, he turns around and is shown to be Dennis Franz in nothing but a diaper; referee Mills Lane shouts at him, \\"I told you I didn't want you in my ring, Dennis Franz!\\", to which an annoyed Franz leaves not before replying back, \\"Alright, tough guy.\\" * Blockbuster Video commercial, baby dances to the Rick James hit, \\"Give It to Me Baby\\". * The Dancing Baby is also spoofed in an episode of The Simpsons, \\"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes\\", in which Homer visits (and later steals from) a website featuring Jesus dancing with the same moves as the baby. * In the television series Millennium, the episode \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" features a demon who manifests himself in the form of a baby, dancing to the Black Flag song \\"My War\\". Writer/director Darin Morgan based the baby on its use in Ally McBeal; as he commented, \\"It's a terrifying thing, that baby. She dances with it, and you go, 'There's something really wrong with this person.'\\" * During the song \\"So Young\\" on the live concert DVD The Corrs: Live at Lansdowne Road the dancing baby is visible on the screens in the back of the stage. * In an episode of Chowder, a parody of the dancing baby (looking rather demonic) appears, causing everyone to freak out and scream at the sight of it. * In the 2002 movie Life or Something Like It, the Dancing Baby appears on the score board at the baseball game. * The Cincinnati, Ohio classic rock station WEBN featured the dancing baby dancing to the song \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" by AC/DC on a television commercial for the station. * In the episode of Family Guy called \\"McStroke\\", Stewie Griffin and Brian Griffin bet on whether or not Stewie could become the coolest kid in high school in a week. He did, so Brian had to email all of his friends the Dancing Baby video. * In 2010, the Dancing Baby appeared on an episode of SuperNews!. * In 2015, it made an appearance in a Delta safety video. * The Dancing Baby makes several appearances in the Tiger Award-winning Peruvian film Videophilia (and Other Viral Syndromes). =Video games= Several video games have included references to the Dancing Baby. * In the EA Sports football game FIFA 99, the editor includes an animation of a player doing the Dancing Baby dance. * The Dancing Baby also makes an appearance in the Xbox and PS2 title, Silent Hill 4. * An easter egg exists in Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire where the hero dances in the Dead Parrot Inn, imitating the exact moves of the Dancing Baby. * In the official trailer for Stalin vs. Martians, Stalin dances around the same as Dancing Baby.Official trailer on YouTube * The Dancing Baby was used in an animation featured at the end of a level in the game RollerTyping. * In the computer game Zoo Tycoon, the gorillas will sometimes do the same dance as the dancing baby. * In a leaked alpha build of Half-Life, the tech demo map contains a model of the Polyrobo, a robot from Robotech, used to test poly limits in the engine will perform an animation that is the baby dance. = More recent appearances = The Dancing Baby is sometimes referenced as a symbol of 1990s culture, or as part of a tradition dating back to the time of its popularity. * The baby is a recurring feature on VH1's I Love the 90s series, and it also appeared on Best Week Ever. * In the Journeyman episode \\"The Year of the Rabbit\\", a scene from Ally McBeal with the Dancing Baby appeared anachronistically in a scene set in 1997. * The ninth episode of the 2016 Netflix series White Rabbit Project briefly features the dancing baby GIF, noting its 1996 appearance was a peak in the popularity of GIFs after their 1987 introduction. * The baby makes an appearance in the 2018 music video 1999 by Charli XCX and Troye Sivan as homage to popular culture of the 90s and 00s, along with many other references. * It has also appeared in an Amazing World of Gumball episode called ‚ÄúThe Web‚Äù, where the dancing baby appears in the song ‚ÄòHashtag Trending‚Äô dancing in the background.

Benedetto was his name in religion on entering the Benedictine Order in 1595. Life Born in Brescia, Castelli studied at the University of Padua and later became an abbot at the Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino. He was a long-time friend and supporter of his teacher, Galileo Galilei, and in turn teacher to Galileo's son. He assisted Galileo's study of sunspots and participated in the examination of the theories of Nicolaus Copernicus. Castelli was interested in mathematics and hydraulics. He was appointed as a mathematician to the University of Pisa, replacing Galileo, and later at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Castelli introduced Bonaventura Cavalieri to Galileo, leading to an extensive correspondence between the latter; Galileo was instrumental in procuring a position for Cavalieri at the University of Bologna in 1629. Castelli was involved in the discovery of the phases of Venus: In December 1610, Galileo received a letter from Castelli, asking if the phases of Venus were observable through Galileo's new telescope.Phases of Venus Days later, Galileo wrote in a letter to Johannes Kepler saying that he'd observed Venus going through phases, but took complete credit for himself. It is unclear, lacking copies of any earlier correspondence, whether Castelli was telling Galileo of it for the first time, or responding to Galileo having previously informed him of it.The Phases of Venus and Heliocentricity: A Rough Guide Castelli died in Rome. His students included Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Raffaello Magiotti, Antonio Nardi, and Evangelista Torricelli, the inventor of the barometer and an early proponent of the air pump. He recommended Gasparo Berti for a chair of mathematics at Sapienza. Berti was to be his successor at the university, but he died before he could take the post. Works Risposta alle opposizioni He published Mensuration of Running Water, an important work on fluids in motion, and then his Geometrical Demonstrations of the Measure of Running Waters in which the publishing notes described him as Abbot of San Benedetto Aloysio and Mathematician to Pope Urban VIII, once a supporter of his mentor, Galileo.

It occurs in the eastern United States and southern Canada. The rostrum (snout) is broad and stout, while the antennae are straight and thin, with the final three antennomeres making a small club. This weevil is found in association with various plants of Fagaceae, Betulaceae, and Juglandaceae, in particular white oak and American beech. Adults feed on new growth and other soft parts, such as leaf petioles and buds. They lay their eggs in the ground, and the grubs then eat the roots of the same plants. Though originally placed in Curculionidae, coleopterists have long agreed that Ithycerus belongs in a different family, as it does not have elbowed antennae, a characteristic of true weevils. It has been traditionally considered as the only species in its own family, Ithyceridae, but more recent classifications place it as the sole member of the subfamily Ithycerinae in the family Brentidae.

They began performing in 1973 and enjoyed their period of greatest success during the 1970s. The group disbanded in 1988.  History  The 2nd Chapter of Acts began as a result of the trio singing at home together as Annie played the piano. Following the death of their parents (Elizabeth in 1968 and Walter Ward in 1970),Booklet included with compilation 20 (1992), chapter \\"Simple Faith\\", section \\"Trouble at Home\\". Nelly and Matthew, still minors, moved in with their older sister, Annie, and her husband, recording engineer and producer, Buck Herring. Annie was a self-taught singer and songwriter who composed and played her songs around the family piano. Her brother and sister would often join in as she played, and eventually they developed extremely tight and intricate harmonies. They started singing for local coffee houses and small gatherings, then gained the notice of Pat Boone who arranged a contract to record and release two singles with MGM, \\"Jesus Is\\" (1972) and \\"I'm So Happy\\" (1973). The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer Barry McGuire, who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for Seeds and McGuire's 1974 follow-up Lighten Up. The trio released their debut album, With Footnotes, in 1974. This album featured \\"Easter Song\\" which would become a signature piece for the group and has been recorded by many other artists since. This was followed up with In the Volume of the Book in 1975, the year that also saw the release of a live album with Barry McGuire, To the Bride, which included \\"a band called David\\", who supported 2nd Chapter of Acts on tour. 2nd Chapter of Acts' first three releases were issued by Myrrh Records, and the group toured with McGuire intermittently for three years. The group went on a touring hiatus in 1976. Annie released her first solo record on the Sparrow Records label founded that year by the executive who had signed them to the Myrrh label, Billy Ray Hearn. For the summer of 1977, they were joined on an 18-city tour by Phil Keaggy and the result was the live triple album, How the West Was One. Their contract with Myrrh fulfilled, they moved as a group to Sparrow. Their Sparrow debut, Mansion Builder (1978) was followed up with The Roar of Love (1980) (a concept album inspired by C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe), Rejoice (1981), Singer Sower (1983), and Together Live (1983) (with Michael and Stormie Omartian). 2nd Chapter moved to their own Live Oak label with the release of Night Light in 1985, and their final recording of original material, Faraway Places in 1987. Their voices can be heard among other Christian artists on two benefit singles in 1985. Do Something Now! credited to The Cause on Sparrow Records to aid famine relief in Africa and Fight the Fight, Rescue the Unborn which featured over 100 Christian artists, to benefit the Christian Pro-Life Movement, released on Live Oak. 2nd Chapter of Acts broadened their appeal with the release of Hymns and Hymns 2, reaching audiences with more traditional music. Hymns proved to be their best-selling release, receiving a Dove Award for \\"Best Praise and Worship Album of the Year\\" in 1987. Except for two sabbatical years in 1976 and 1983, 2nd Chapter of Acts continued to tour until 1988. Their final concert was in Houston, Texas on August 12 of that year. 2nd Chapter was recognized by the Gospel Music Association in 1999 by their induction into its Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Annie and Matthew also recorded several solo projects during the 2nd Chapter of Acts years. Both have continued to release new material and perform concerts as of 2011.  Roles of group members  Annie was the main songwriter of the group and the only one who played an instrument (piano). Her admittedly unschooled compositional style, with its frequent irregular rhythms, added somewhat progressive rock-like elements to what was otherwise a soft-rock sound. Matthew and Nelly initially made the occasional small contribution to the lyrics, and Matthew developed as a songwriter for the group as his solo career grew. Annie and Matthew sang most of the solo parts. Nelly ‚Äî whose voice could be hard to distinguish from Annie's ‚Äî usually sang lead only on songs where each member took a verse (\\"Which Way The Wind Blows\\", \\"Something Tells Me\\", \\"Takin' The Easy Way\\") or on solo pieces without the others singing backup (\\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\", \\"Make My Life a Prayer\\" and \\"Mountain Tops\\"). Vocal leads such as in \\"My Jesus I Love Thee\\" and \\"Sing Over Me\\", where she was backed by the others, were rare exceptions. Her voice was considered the \\"glue\\" to the 2nd Chapter of Acts sound, and her harmony parts were generally the most difficult to sing.

Construction and commissioning Hughes was laid down on 15 September 1937 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; launched on 17 June 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Edward M. Hughes, widow of Commander Hughes; and commissioned at Boston Navy Yard, on 21 September 1939, Lieutenant Commander Donald J. Ramsey in command. Service history =Interwar period= Following shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, Hughes joined the Atlantic Fleet. From July 1940 to December 1941, Hughes served in the Atlantic, first on patrol off Martinique to watch Vichy French Forces there and then on Neutrality patrol off Iceland. During this time, she became the first American destroyer to escort a British convoy all the way to England. =World War II= Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, warships were urgently needed in the Pacific and Hughes sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 18 December 1941, arriving San Diego, California in company with , on 30 December. She departed San Diego on 12 January 1942 as an escort for ships bringing reinforcements to Samoa. Hughes then sailed from Samoa as part of a carrier striking force built around carrier Yorktown. She screened the carrier in strikes on Jaluit, Makin, Mili, and Canton Islands, then supported the combined ‚ÄìYorktown Task Force 17 (TF17), as it attacked Japanese bases at Lae and Salamaua on 10 March 1942. Missing the Battle of the Coral Sea while escorting a tanker carrying fuel to Noum√©a, Hughes reached Pearl Harbor in time to participate in the Battle of Midway. Hughes, while protecting Yorktown during this action, shot down two torpedo planes and assisted in shooting down two others. After Yorktown was hit on 4 June, Hughes continued an all-night vigil to prevent her capture. When the carrier was torpedoed by a submarine on 6 June, Hughes helped damage the attacker with depth charges, and rescued the survivors when Yorktown sank the next day. After a brief time as convoy escort, she joined American Forces at Guadalcanal, where she screened throughout the campaign. During the Battle of Santa Cruz. Hughes splashed one Japanese plane and assisted in downing two more. Despite her valiant efforts, Hornet was hit and sunk on 27 October 1942. Joining TF 16 on 10 November 1942, Hughes participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal by screening . Hughes continued screening operations until the end of February 1943. Following a refit and brief convoy duty, Hughes was detached from the South Pacific and sailed to Pearl Harbor, departing on 18 April for the Aleutian Islands and arrived on the 24. Bombardments of Kiska from 6‚Äì22 July were high points of her months in northern waters. After Kiska was occupied, Hughes departed the Aleutians for overhaul on 25 August in San Francisco, California. Following overhaul, Hughes sailed for Pearl Harbor on 26 October to prepare for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. She sailed on 10 November as part of the screen for the escort carriers covering the invasion of Makin Atoll. When was sunk on 24 November, Hughes rescued 152 of the survivors. She began screening the transport group on 27 November, and 2 days later departed for Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on 7 December 1943. On 13 January 1944, Hughes joined TF 53 for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She joined in the preinvasion from 3‚Äì11 February 1944. The destroyer continued to support the escort carriers during the strikes against Palaus on 31 March. Hughes took part in the invasion of Hollandia, New Guinea on 23 April, acting as a screen for the escort carrier group which provided air cover for the landings at Aitape and Tanahmerah Bay. Hughes remained off New Guinea as a convoy escort and fire-support ship of the 7th Fleet until 25 September, when she departed for the invasion of the Philippines. During this time, Hughes participated in the invasions of Biak, Noemfoor, Cape Sensapor, and Morotai, serving as flagship of Rear Admiral William M. Fechteler during the latter campaign. During the invasion of Leyte, Hughes was the flagship of Rear Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble commanding the tiny task group detailed to capture the small islands of Dinigat and Homohon guarding the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Following the successful conclusion of this operation, Hughes screened Philippine bound convoys, making frequent trips to and from New Guinea until 6 December 1944, when she reembarked Admiral Struble and departed for the invasion of Ormoc Bay, Leyte. Following this operation, Hughes was serving as a picket destroyer off the southern tip of Leyte when she was hit by a G4M kamikaze on 10 December 1944. Her dead and wounded totalled twenty three.R.Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p.145 Badly damaged with one engine room demolished and much of her other machinery destroyed, Hughes was towed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, where, after temporary repairs, she departed for Humboldt Bay, New Guinea on 19 December en route to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 23 January 1945. Following more repairs, she sailed for San Francisco, arriving San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 2 February. Hughes remained there for the next 3 months undergoing extensive overhaul. After a long testing period, Hughes was declared combat ready and departed for Adak Island in the Aleutians on 4 June 1945. Assigned to the Northern Pacific Force, she remained in the Aleutians until the end of the war, harassing enemy shipping and bombarding Japanese bases. Hughes then served as part of the patrol force off Northern Honsh≈´ until relieved on 20 October. She sailed for the United States 10 days later with Destroyer Squadron 2. She was decommissioned on 28 August 1946, and was used as a target ship in the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb test. Following the test she was towed to sea and sunk off Kwajalein on 16 October 1948, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 November 1948. Awards Hughes earned 14 battle stars for World War II service.  In fiction  * In the 2003 video game Secret Weapons Over Normandy, USS Hughes is seen as one of the escort ships for the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown at the Battle of Midway. She either makes it through the battle as she historically did, or is sunk by Japanese dive or torpedo bombers, depending on how well the player does at shooting down the incoming Japanese planes.

Between 1985 and 2002, the band released six studio albums. Their 1995 single \\"Roll to Me\\" reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Five Del Amitri albums have reached the Top 10 in the UK. Globally, Del Amitri have sold six million albums.  History  =Band name= Del Amitri's founding member and main songwriter, Justin Currie, explained in 2010 that the band's name \\"was invented to be meaningless ‚Äì basically a corruption of the Greek name 'Dimitri'.\\"Steinfeld, Dave. (2010). \\"Catching Up with Justin Currie .\\" Beyond Race Magazine. Retrieved 23 May 2011. In 2018, Currie clarified that 'Del Amitri' is a bastardisation of the name of a film producer who appeared in the closing credits of a film he saw in 1979 ‚Äì \\"probably Dimitri-something, but we couldn't remember... so eventually through osmosis or maybe Chinese Whispers 'Dimitri' became 'Del Amitri'.\\" Many sources have repeated a claim that the name was chosen because it is Greek for \\"from the womb\\", but this is untrue. =Formation and early years (1980-1984)= Del Amitri grew out of Justin Currie's Jordanhill College School band. The band was formed with the original line-up of Currie (bass and vocals), James Scobbie (guitars), Donald Bentley (guitars) and Paul Tyagi (drums). Scobbie and Bentley left the band in 1982 to study at university. A new line-up came together after Currie placed an advertisement in the window of a music store. Scobbie and Bentley were replaced by Iain Harvie (guitar) and Bryan Tolland (second guitar). From then on, Currie and Harvie have remained the only constant members of the band. = del Amitri (1985) = In 1984, Del Amitri were signed by Chrysalis Records, which released their eponymous debut album in 1985. = Waking Hours (1989) = As recording started for what would become Del Amitri's second album, the line-up changed. Currie and Harvie invited keyboard player Andy Alston to join the band and fired both guitarist Bryan Tolland and drummer Paul Tyagi. Tolland was replaced in the studio by Mick Slaven and Tyagi by The Commotions' Stephen Irvine. However, Slaven and Irvine chose not to join the band full- time and were replaced by David Cummings and Brian McDermott, respectively. Released in 1989, Waking Hours reached No.6 in the UK Albums Chart and gave the band their most successful UK single, \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\", which peaked at No 11. They also gained some mainstream exposure abroad for the first time, as Waking Hours was a success in several territories with the single \\"Kiss This Thing Goodbye\\" flirting with the lower reaches of the US Billboard Hot 100's Top 40. In between Waking Hours and their next album, the band released the single \\"Spit In the Rain\\", which reached No. 21 in the UK. =Change Everything (1992)= The line-up of Currie, Harvie, Alston, Cummings and McDermott proved to be stable and successful. They stayed together to record the follow-up album Change Everything, which was released in 1992 and became the band's biggest chart success, reaching No. 2 in the UK, being held off top spot only by Lionel Ritchie's best-of collection, Back to Front. The single \\"Always the Last to Know\\" peaked at No. 13 in the UK, and again provided them with an entry into Top 40 in the US. The video for the song was directed by Oil Factory's Pedro Romhanyi. Their increasing success in the USA led to appearances on the television show Late Night with David Letterman and the Woodstock '94 anniversary festival. = Twisted (1995) = Twisted was released in 1995 and peaked at No. 3 in the UK. Soan joined the band as a permanent member, although on the album, drums were played by Chris Sharrock. The single \\"Roll to Me\\", only a moderate hit in the UK where it reached No. 22, reached the Top 10 in the US charts; this was a noteworthy achievement during an era when British acts were finding success in the US difficult. = Some Other Sucker's Parade (1997) = Del Amitri's fifth album, Some Other Sucker's Parade, was released in 1997 and reached No. 6 in the UK chart. The band found it harder to capitalise on their previous successes in the US, however, and lost out on more airplay at home when their record company took the decision to withdraw the album's planned third single \\"Medicine\\" in September 1997, putting out a false press story that the lyrics could be interpreted as a critique of the then recently deceased Diana, Princess of Wales. = Don't Come Home Too Soon and Hatful of Rain: The Best of Del Amitri (1998) = Five years passed before Del Amitri released another album. In 1998, however, they recorded the official anthem for the Scottish World Cup squad, \\"Don't Come Home Too Soon\\". It reached No. 15 on the charts, becoming their third biggest UK hit and their last Top 20 entry to date. They also released a best of album, Hatful of Rain: The Best of Del Amitri, which was a No. 5 success in the UK Albums Chart and was accompanied by a new track, \\"Cry to Be Found\\", which reached No. 40. =Can You Do Me Good? (2002)= The 2014 tour line-up of Del Amitri performing at Vicar Street in Dublin. The album Can You Do Me Good? was released in the spring of 2002. Both the album and the single \\"Just Before You Leave\\", reached the Top 40. The band then went on hiatus. = Reunion tours (2014, 2018) = On 18 August 2013, during an interview with Terry Wogan on his BBC Radio 2 programme, Currie hinted at a Del Amitri reunion. A UK tour was subsequently announced. As part of the tour, the band played to 8,000 people in the SSE Hydro, Glasgow on 24 January 2014. A live album, called Into The Mirror, was released following the tour. Del Amitri reformed again in July 2018, playing eight dates in seven UK cities. Their live set included a new song, 'You Can't Go Back', and a cover of Twenty One Pilots' hit song, \\"Heathens\\". In July 2018, Currie said that a new group album and further activity was possible. = Seventh album (2020) = On 2 March 2020, drummer Ash Soan revealed that work on Del Amitri's seventh studio album had begun at Vada Studios, Worcestershire. On 8 April, Justin Currie confirmed that the band finished recording the album \\"the night before the UK- wide lockdown\\" began on 24 March, and that they expected to tour in January 2021, following a one-off free show in December 2020 for Scottish NHS workers. On May 5th via a short video clip, the band announced that they had signed to Cooking Vinyl.

She first saw action in the air raids on Luzon and Formosa, which accompanied the advance of ground forces on Leyte, and prepared for the invasion at Lingayen from November 1944 into January 1945. On 14 November 1944, while acting as a picket for TF 38, she was attacked by four Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bombers. The ship is credited with shooting down two Betty bombers and dodging two torpedoes on this day. In January the carriers she screened continued to launch air attacks on Taiwan, the China coast, and the Nansei Shoto, and on 16 and 17 February sailed daringly close to the Japanese coast to strike targets on Honsh≈´ before giving air cover to the invasion of Iwo Jima from 20 to 22 February. Collett returned to Empire waters with the carrier task force to screen during air raids on Honsh≈´ 25 February 1945, joined in the bombardment of Okino Daito Shima 2 March, and returned to screening during the air strikes on Ky≈´sh≈´ and southern Honsh≈´ of 18 to 20 March. From 23 March to 24 April, the force concentrated its strikes on Okinawa, invaded on 1 April. On 18 April Collett joined with four other destroyers and carrier aircraft to sink Japanese submarine at. After replenishing at Ulithi, Collett rejoined TF 58 11 May 1945 for its final month of air strikes supporting the Okinawa operation, and from 10 July to 15 August sailed with the carriers as they flew their final series of heavy air attacks on the Japanese home islands.

Similar duty, aside from bombardment, was her assignment during her third tour, from 29 August 1952 to 9 April 1953. From the close of the Korean war, Collett served in the Far East in between 1953 and 1959. Early in 1960 she began an extensive modernization, which continued until July 1960. On 19 July 1960, Collett collided with the destroyer off Newport Beach, California, killing 11 and injuring 20, all members of Ammens crew. USCGC Heather rendered assistance after the collision.

In the autumn of 1964, a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) was installed at the Yokosuka Naval Shipyard. Collett returned to Long Beach via Australia but returned to the Seventh Fleet in 1965 for duty from May to August.

It was serialized by Shueisha in Ribon from April 2002 and January 2005 and collected in seven bound volumes. It was adapted as a 26-episode anime television series produced by TMS Entertainment and Animax, broadcast in Japan on Animax from April to October 2004. The series is about a teenage boy, Kippei, who becomes the caretaker of his 5-year-old cousin, Yuzuyu, after her mother abandons her. Both the manga and anime have been praised for successfully mixing serious issues with a light- hearted tone. Plot Aishiteruze Baby is a sh≈çjo manga series that revolves around the life of Kippei, a popular high-school playboy who flirts with any girl he sees, without thinking about their feelings. His life is turned upside down when one day his aunt abandons his five-year-old cousin Yuzuyu at his house. Kippei is assigned the task of taking care of Yuzuyu for the time being, and he must learn how to become the \\"mother\\" she needs. As Kippei learns how to care for Yuzuyu, he also learns to care for Kokoro, a quiet girl at his school, who helps him out. In Japanese, is a casual, masculine way of saying \\"I love you\\" (see Gender differences in spoken Japanese). Characters ; : :Kippei is a 17-year-old promiscuous high school student, well known for his playboy habits. However, due to his friendly personality, he is very popular at school. One day, his 5-year-old cousin, Yuzuyu, is suddenly placed in his care. At first, Kippei is unsure of how to take care of his cousin. When he realizes that taking care of Yuzuyu is a full-time job, he drops his promiscuous ways. As the story progresses, Kippei matures quickly into a responsible \\"parent,\\" making sure Yuzuyu is his top priority. Not only does Kippei wake up early every day to make Yuzuyu lunch, he walks her to and from her preschool. In addition, he cares for Yuzuyu's psychological well- being in the absence of her mother. Meanwhile, Kippei also pursues his love interest, Kokoro Tokunaga, whom he finds to be a great woman. Eventually, Kippei, realizing how lonely Kokoro is living by herself, asks his family to let her move in with them, which they quickly agree to. Near the end of the manga, Yuzuyu's mother returns to take Yuzuyu back but Kippei's mother refuses until her sister can prove to her that she is ready. Despite this, and his attachment to Yuzuyu, Kippei understands that she needs her mother and insists on letting Yuzuyu leave with her mother. At the end of volume seven, about 10 years have passed. Yuzuyu appears to be a happy teen and Kokoro is still living with Kippei, presumably they have married (which now makes her Kokoro Katakura). The manga ends with Yuzuyu's letter to Kippei, thanking him for taking care of her when she was young. ; : :Yuzuyu (\\"Yuzu\\" for short) is a bubbly little 5-year-old girl. Having been abandoned by her mother, Yuzuyu begins to adapt to her new life with Kippei as her guardian. As the story progresses, Yuzuyu grows very attached to Kippei. When Yuzuyu meets Kokoro, she is scared Kokoro will take Kippei away from her. However, she eventually warms up to Kokoro and they become friends. Throughout the series, Yuzuyu struggles with the absence of her mother and is often seen crying herself to sleep. Yuzuyu tries her best in hopes that her mother will one day come back for her which conflicts with her wish to stay with Kippei. At the end of volume seven, Yuzuyu is a happy teenager who has reunited with her childhood friend, Shouta. She starts most of her sentences with \\"yuzu\\"-(„ÇÜ„Åö). ; : :Kokoro is a pretty classmate of Kippei. Because she lost her mother at a young age, she has a quiet personality. Her father quickly remarried and left Kokoro to fend for herself in a luxurious apartment, believing that because she was quiet, she would prefer to live alone. This is not the case, however, and she feels extremely lonely living by herself with no one else to rely on. Kokoro initially despises Kippei for his promiscuous ways. However, after seeing how gentle he is and how much he cares for Yuzuyu, Kokoro begins to fall in love with him. Kokoro sympathizes with Yuzuyu and understands Kippei's responsibility for Yuzuyu. As such, she lets him get away with a lot of idiotic behavior. At the end of volume six, for a brief time, Kokoro believes she's pregnant, only to find out that it was a false alarm. However, she admits to Kippei that she had hoped she was pregnant, despite the problems that would arise, because it would mean that she would be able to spend more time with him. Soon after, Kokoro moves in with Kippei's family. At the end of the manga, Kokoro and Kippei are living with his parents and it is implied that they are married (which now makes her Kokoro Katakura). ; : :Misako is Kippei's mother who is a school crossing guard, among other things.

She is a cosmetologist and everyone in Kippei's family follows her orders. She is known for her stylish outfits and nails. She has a secret which she reveals to Kippei late in the series that she cannot have any children. This greatly influences how she feels about Aunt Miyako for abandoning Yuzuyu. ; : :Miyako is the younger sister of Misako and the biological mother of Yuzuyu. She found that taking care of Yuzuyu by herself after her husband had died was more than she could handle. She later admits to Kippei that she once struck Yuzuyu and it is inferred that her fear of doing so again is the main reason why she left Yuzuyu with his family. She intends to come back once she can be a proper mother to Yuzuyu. In the end of the manga, she returns and takes Yuzuyu back. Years later, Yuzuyu is shown to be a healthy and happy teen. ; : :Satsuki is Kippei's 12-year-old brother. He is very intelligent and mature for his age, so much so that he seems emotionless. Although he doesn't like children in general, he gets along with Yuzuyu very well. Near the end of the story it is assumed that Ayumi and Satsuki are in a relationship. ; and :Voiced by: Maki Sait≈ç (Aki) and Fuyuka ≈åura (Mai) :Kokoro's friends. They, and especially Aki, don't approve much of Kokoro and Kippei's relationship, given his past actions and reputation. Rather than being busybodies, they really just want what is best for Kokoro. Aki is in love with Shin. ; : :One of Yuzuyu's best friends and her first love. Kippei is unhappy that Yuzuyu has a crush on him. When Shouta first meets Yuzuyu, the two become instant friends and begin to do everything together. Shouta loves his family dearly, however he has been abused by his mother for some time. When Yuzuyu witnessed Shouta being hit, she began to cry and scream, and the entire preschool, as well as the parents, found out about him and his mother. Kippei is greatly affected by Shouta's being abused and tries to help by talking to the child's mother. Shouta later gets a concussion from a fall, precipitated by his mother, which results in a trip to the hospital. The doctors notice the signs of previous injuries and on their recommendation his parents decide to go into family counseling and move in with Shouta's grandparents for more support. When he leaves, he promises Yuzuyu that he will always be her friend. While separated, they remain in contact with each other. Eventually he and Yuzuyu meet again as teenagers. ; : :Miki is Yuzuyu's 14-year-old cousin on her father's side. Volume 4 of the manga is mostly Miki's story. In the manga, she carries a knife, which was changed to a bike chain in the anime. Miki attended a prestigious school where she witnessed a teacher beating a fellow classmate. When she confronted her teacher, everything backfired. She was harassed by her peers and teacher, but refused to tell her parents. Kippei notices the burns and scars on her wrists, indicating that Miki engaged in self-harm. She tries to take Yuzuyu away from the Katakura residence so that her parents will have a substitute for her when she attempts suicide, which Kippei prevents. (In the anime she intends to jump from a building, in the manga she uses a knife.) In the end, the issues between her and her parents are resolved. She appears again in Volume 6. ; and :Voiced by: Aoi Y≈´ki as Aoi Yabusaki (Marika) and Yuutaro Motoshiro (Ken) : Yuzuyu's friends from preschool. While Marika can be quite stuck-up for a five-year-old Ken is kind and strong. Marika develops a crush on Kippei-onii- chan (as Yuzuyu calls Kippei) after he catches her when she trips ‚Äì to the point that when her mother arrives to pick her up, she demands that her mother provide her with an onii-chan of her own. She is also jealous of the girls with whom he shows up at the pre-school (usually Kokoro). Marika is Yuzuyu's best friend. ; : :Kippei's friend and classmate. He and Aki have feelings for each other. ; : :Called \\"Nattsu\\" for short, she is Kippei's former \\"girlfriend\\" (more of a \\"friend with benefits\\" since it is implied that they have had sexual intercourse in the past). Since Yuzuyu's arrival, Nattsu misses hanging out with Kippei the way they used to. Although she enjoyed spending time with him, Nattsu had no interest in having a serious relationship with Kippei. The distance enforced by Kippei's responsibilities towards Yuzuyu have made Nattsu realize that she really cares for him (and has had feelings for him for some time). Unfortunately for her, her previous indifference means that she has lost her chance at Kippei since he is now serious about Kokoro. ; : :Ayumi is Satsuki's classmate and works part-time as a model. She is four centimeters taller than Satsuki and secretly in love with him. Ayumi's friends decide to twit her about her feelings for Satsuki by making up rumors about Satsuki's preferences in girls which are the exact opposite of her appearance. Undaunted, she builds up the nerve to confess to him and is pleasantly surprised when Satsuki tells her that he does not mind any of her traits. She is later seen eating dinner at the Katakura house and is presumed to be Satsuki's girlfriend. ; and :Akari is Kippei's classmate and her sister, Aya, goes to Yuzuyu's daycare where they are friends. Their situation is similar to that of Kippei and Yuzuyu in that Akari must take care of her sister because her parents are always working. Akari confides in Kippei which, among other things, results in trouble. They only appear in the manga. ; :Itagaki is a boy from Kippei's school who has a crush on Kokoro. He confesses to her and even forces a kiss on her, scaring Kokoro and making her afraid of being touched, even by Kippei. Everything is resolved during a school trip when Kippei warns Itagaki that he will kill him if he does anything to Kokoro. After this, Itagaki no longer appears in the manga. Media =Manga= The manga Aishiteruze Baby was written and illustrated by Yoko Maki. It was serialized by Shueisha the sh≈çjo (aimed at teenage girls) manga magazine Ribon from April 2002 to January 2005. The serial chapters were collected in seven tank≈çbon volumes under the Ribon Mascot Comics imprint. It is licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has released all seven volumes in English starting in April 2006. It is also licensed in France by G√©n√©ration Comics, in Italy by Panini Comics, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, and in South Korea by Seoul Media Group. =Anime= Aishiteruze Baby was adapted into an anime television series by TMS and Animax. It was directed by Masaharu Okuwaki, with music by Miki Kasamatsu and character designs by Junko Yamanaka and Masatomo Sudo. The opening theme was \\"Sunny Side Up\\" performed by Yo Hitoto, and the ending theme was performed by Yo Hitoto. The series was initially broadcast in 26 episodes across Japan on Animax from 3 April 2004 to 9 October 2004. It is licensed in France by Taifu Video.  Reception  According to the German manga journal MangasZene, Aishiteruze Baby is drawn in a style typical of sh≈çjo manga, with non-uniform panel layouts and frequent use of screentones. The reviewer praised the clean use of backgrounds, well- differentiated character designs, and Maki's handling of delicate issues such as the rival, Miki, and parental abandonment, while still keeping a comic tone. The same article described anime adaption as one of the sh≈çjo anime highlights of 2004. The reviewer criticized the art of the anime adaptation as not as successful as the manga, being done in a simpler style, but praised the Japanese voice actors as well as mood-setting of the opening song, \\"Sunny Side Up.\\" A reviewer at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews praised the anime as \\"a touching and heartfelt sh≈çjo drama,\\" giving it 5 out of 5 stars. The reviewer cited the character of Yuzuyu as part of the success, as \\"a kid who actually acts like a kid and not like a little adult.\\" The reviewer noted that the animation was \\"somewhat low-budget,\\" and that the character designs only somewhat resemble the Maki's designs in the original manga.

Glenfield is located 36 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. History Glenfield was named after the property founded by early colonial surgeon and explorer, Charles Throsby. According to local authorities and Campbelltown City Library, the property was named after the Glenfield in Leicestershire, England, where Throsby was born and brought up. Many of the streets in the suburb have links to British names, such as Canterbury Road, Cambridge Avenue and Trafalgar Street. The name was first used when Glenfield railway station was built in 1869 although a village didn't begin to develop until 1881 when the first subdivision of the paddocks were marketed. A public school opened in a tent the following year and a local post office was established in 1899. Hurlstone Agricultural High School also moved to Glenfield in the 1920s. However, the suburb did not really develop until the 1950s and 1960s. =1968 Siege= Glenfield gained notoriety in 1968 as the site of a hostage siege which ended in bizarre circumstances with the NSW Commissioner of Police Norm Allen acting as witness to the wedding of gunman Wally Mellish and hostage Beryl Muddle. The incident was made into the movie Mr Reliable starring Colin Friels and Jacqueline McKenzie. Climate Population According to the 2016 census, Glenfield had a population of 9,633 people with higher than average numbers of couples with children (56.3%). 45.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 9.1%, Bangladesh 4.3%, Philippines 3.8%, China 3.3% and Fiji 2.9%. 41.9% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Bengali 5.9%, Hindi 5.1%, Mandarin 3.6%, Arabic 3.2% and Malayalam 2.7%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 21.4%, Jedi 15.0%, Hinduism 12.2% and Islam 10.8%. Most occupied private houses in the area are separate houses (70.4%) with a substantial number of townhouses (28.0%). Housing New Facilities in the Vista Estate A number of new residential subdivisions have been developed in the north- western corner of Glenfield in the area bounded by Campbelltown Road and Glenfield Road. These developments are called Panorama, Vista at Panorama, Glenfield Circuit & Parkside Glenfield and are mixed density housing comprising duplex and freestanding housing. Panorama, Vista at Panorama estates are community titled with amenities such as pool, tennis courts, security patrols and barbecues that are available for exclusive use of residents. Community activities such as cocktails nights, family fun days and street Christmas parties are also organized by a third party company to encourage a close knit community atmosphere.

Symptoms often include abdominal pain, vomiting, agitation, a fast respiratory rate, and a specific \\"fruity\\" smell. Consciousness is generally normal. Complications may include sudden death. AKA most commonly occurs in long term alcoholics and less commonly in those who binge drink. Onset is generally after a decreased ability to eat for a few days. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Blood sugar levels are often normally or only mildly increased. Other conditions that may present similarly include other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis. Treatment is generally with intravenous normal saline and intravenous sugar solution. Thiamine and measures to prevent alcohol withdrawal are also recommended. Treatment of low blood potassium may also be required. Those who are affected are most frequently between the ages of 20 and 60. The condition was initially recognized in 1940 and named in 1971. Signs and symptoms Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are commonly present and people may also have tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. In contrast to diabetic ketoacidosis, people with alcoholic ketoacidosis are usually alert and lucid despite the severity of the acidosis. Causes Alcoholic ketoacidosis is caused by complex physiology that is the result of prolonged and heavy alcohol intake, usually in the setting of poor nutrition. Chronic alcohol use can cause depleted hepatic glycogen stores and ethanol metabolism further impairs gluconeogenesis. This can reduce glucose availability and lead to hypoglycemia and increased reliance on fatty acid and ketone metabolism. An additional stressor such as vomiting or dehydration can cause an increase in counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone which may further increase free fatty acid release and ketone production. Ethanol metabolism can also increase blood lactic acid levels which may also contribute to a metabolic acidosis. Diagnosis Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. An elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis is the classic present. However, a mixed acid-base disorder may be present especially if vomiting is contributing to a hypochloremic alkalosis. The ketone which is present is mostly beta-hydroxybutryate rather than acetoacetate resulting in only a weakly positive nitroprusside test. People usually do not present with high blood sugar or sugar in the urine. This can cause false negative results when testing urine ketones as they only measure acetoacetate. Ethanol level are often low or negative despite a chronic alcohol use history. Electrolyte disturbances may include hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may also be present. =Differential diagnosis= Other conditions that may present similarly include other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis such as diabetic ketoacidosis, toxic alcohol ingestion, and starvation ketosis. Toxic alcohol ingestion include methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. Pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and gastritis may also result in similar symptoms. The ratio of beta-hydroxybutryate to acetoacetate is usually higher in AKA (8:1) in contrast to diabetic ketoacidosis (3:1). Management Treatment includes administration of intravenous saline to rehydrate and 5% dextrose to turn off gluconeogenesis. Electrolyte imbalances, specifically hypokalaemia, should be corrected. Thiamine supplementation is often included to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. Insulin is generally not used due to risk of hypoglycemia. Other potential causes of the symptoms should be ruled out.  Prognosis  Outcomes are generally favorable with treatment but up to 10% may develop cardiac arrest. It is proposed that alcoholic ketoacidosis is a significant cause of death among people with chronic alcoholism although the true prevalence is unknown. Estimation of prevalence and outcomes of this population is limited by difficulty in diagnosing the condition and the presence of multiple disorders at presentation. History In 1940, Edward S. Dillon, W. Wallace, and Leon S. Smelo, first described alcoholic ketoacidosis as a distinct syndrome. They stated that \\"because of the many and complex factors, both physiologic and pathologic, which influence the acid-base balance of the body, a multitude of processes may bring about the state of acidosis as an end result.\\" In 1971, David W. Jenkins and colleagues described cases of three non‚Äêdiabetic people with a history of chronic heavy alcohol misuse and recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis. This group also proposed a possible underlying mechanism for this metabolic disturbance, naming it alcoholic ketoacidosis.

He is renowned for defeating and overthrowing Ellalan, the usurping Tamil prince from the Chola Kingdom, who had invaded the Kingdom of Rajarata in 205 BC. Dutugamunu also expanded and beautified the city of Anuradhapura and projected the power of his native Rajarata region across the island of Sri Lanka. Due to his significance as one of the most potent symbols of Sinhalese historical power, Dutugamunu's story is swathed in myth and legend. However, many aspects of the accounts of his life have been verified by contemporary inscriptions, and the basic account of his life is generally accepted as accurate.  Etymology  KING DUTUGEMUNU (161 BC ‚Äì 137 BC) The Mahavamsa describes how as a youth he mocked his father Kavantissa, king of Ruhuna, for refusing to wage war against the powerful invading Elara, the Chola king of Anuradhapura, who usurped the throne by killing the native kings. The prince stated that \\"If [his] father were a man he would not speak thus\\" and sent him a piece of women's jewellery. The resulting fury of the king caused many of his friends to flee to Malaya region and the prince himself being dubbed Dutthagamani, meaning \\"disobedient\\". After his death, he was referred to as Dharma Gamini (\\"righteous Gamini\\"), but it is as Duttha Gamini or Dutugemunu that he is known to posterity.  Ancestry and family  The Mahavamsa constitutes the major source on Dutugemunu's reign and dedicates some six chapters (out of 35) to his tale. In chapter 22 he is described as being descended from the ancient royal family of Rajarata through Devanampiyatissa's brother Mahanaga. At the time of his birth Dutugemunu's father was Kavantissa, king of Ruhuna, a small kingdom in south-east Sri Lanka outside of the influence of Rajarata in the north; the border between the two polities was the Mahaganga, or 'Great River', possibly the modern Menik Ganga. Kavantissa is portrayed in the Mahamvamsa as 'devoutly believing in the three gems, [and] he provided the brotherhood continually with...needful things'. Dutugemunu's mother was Viharamahadevi, daughter of Tissa, king of Kalyani. Legend has it that as punishment for Tissa slaying a Buddhist monk, Kalyani had been subject to a series of deluges from the sea. To placate it Tissa placed his daughter Devi in a golden boat with the words 'A King's Daughter' written on the side, and set her out to sea. Miraculously the princess washed ashore, alive and well, in Ruhuna, and married Kavantissa. During her pregnancy with Dutugemunu, Viharamahadevi had a series of peculiar cravings, including the urge to sleep on a pillow made of honeycombs. In particular her urge to drink the water used to wash a sword that had cleaved the head of a warrior of Elara, whilst standing on that same head, raised the interest of the soothsayers at court, who predicted that 'The queen's son, when he has vanquished the Damilas (Tamil) and built up a united kingdom, will make the doctrine to shine forth brightly'. Viharamahadevi gave birth to a son named Gamani Abhaya some time later, and after that to another child, a boy named Tissa. Around the time of Gamani's birth, 'an elephant of the six-tusked race brought his young one thither and left him here and went his way'. Named Kandula, he went on to become Gamani's mount and accompanied him through much of the prince's adventures. Dutugemunu's sister > \\"Recent archaeological studies have found evidence proving that King > Kavantissa had a daughter who was a sister to King Dutu Gemunu\\". New evidence to this appeared inhttp://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page;=article- details&code;_title=162687 The Island of March 27, 2017.  The battle in the palace and early reign  Anuradhapura By the age of sixteen Gamani was 'vigorous, renowned, intelligent and a hero in majesty and might', if a little wayward. Determined to expel the invading king of Rajarata, Gamani levied an army from around Rohana and declared his intention to regain the north to his father. The king forbade this stating that 'the land on this side of the river is enough'; the resulting exchange between father and son saw Gamani being dubbed 'Duttha Gamani', his friends fleeing to Malaya, and he himself being incarcerated in a royal prison. Kavantissa is known as a brilliant strategist who recognized early that he needed to make his kingdom powerful before waging a war against the invaders. He assembled armies and made his kingdom prosperous in \\"rice and betel leaf\\" - this meaning that the people had a lot of agricultural surplus. The legendary ten \\"great giants\\" - men who had great strength ‚Äì are brought into the army at this time. Kavantissa repeatedly makes Dutugemunu and Tissa swear that they would never fight one another and that they would always respect and listen to the advice of the priests. He also makes the ten giants swear never to pick sides in a war between the brothers. Upon Kavantissa's death, Dutugemunu found himself having to defend his crown against his younger brother Tissa, who had seized possession of not only the elephant Kandula, but the dowager queen Viharamahadevi as well. The war between the two began with a defeat for Dutugemunu at Culanganiyapitthi, where 'many thousands of the king's (Dutugemunu's) men' perished. Dutugemunu was forced to flee back to Mahagama where he levied another army and engaged Tissa in yet another battle in the vicinity of the city. Legend has it that as Tissa, fought his brother riding the royal elephant \\"Kandula\\" against Dutugemunu who rode a mare. Dutugemunu at one point made the mare jump over the elephant causing the elephant to recognize its master and attempt to kill Tissa who hastily dismounts via a tree. Dutugemunu was victorious and Tissa was smuggled off the battlefield disguised as the corpse of a monk. It is said that Dutugemunu recognized the ploy and called out to his brother \\"Are you not ashamed to be carried on the back of these priests?\\" Some time afterwards, however, Dutugemunu and Tissa were reconciled through the efforts of Viharamahadevi and the monks, and Tissa became one of the king's foremost generals.  Regaining of Rajarata  Having secured his throne, he then planned his operations to regain the north, which included not only Rajarata but numerous smaller semi-independent polities. The king's army consisted of 'chariots, troops and beasts for riders', soldiers and a number of war elephants, as well as a number of monks (to advise the King) and a relic placed in his spear for luck and blessings. In addition he was accompanied by the famed Ten Giant Warriors who had been recruited from all over the island by his father Kavantissa ‚Äì Nandhimitra, Suranimala, Mahasena, Theraputtabhya, Gotaimbara, Bharana, Vasabha, Khanjadeva, Velusamanna, and Phussadeva. The campaign saw Dutugemunu subduing a number of usurping Tamil rulers in the north (as many as 32, according to the Mahavamsa). Of particular interest is the four-month siege of Vijitanagara, where the defending Tamil troops are said to have used 'red-hot iron and molten pitch' to panic Dutugemunu's elephants. During this time he also married Ran Etana, the daughter of a chieftain who continued to pay homage to Elara of Anuradhapura. On at least two occasions victory is attributed to the king's 'cunning' and the bravery of Kandhula. The campaign reached a climax at the eastern gate of Anuradhapura, where Dutugemunu, riding Kandhula, finally confronted the aged usurped king Elara, on his own elephant Mah√§pabbata, and slew him with a spear; the encounter is one of the most famous in Sri Lankan history. Dutugemunu's victory at Anuradhapura put him in the unprecedented position of ruling nearly the entire island of (Sri) Lanka. Despite this however his position was far from problem-free. Elara, despite being an invading Tamil from the Chola empire of south India, was renowned as having been a just and righteous leader, and Dutugemunu went out of his way to ensure the memory of the old king was revered as he cremated Elara and built a tomb for his ashes and made rules for travelers to get off and pay their respects to his tomb. Furthermore, 'looking back upon his glorious victory, great though it was, [he] knew no joy, remembering that thereby was wrought the destruction of thousands of both enemies and his soldiers.' This is attested to by the sheer number of religious foundations attributed to him by the chronicles (between 68 and 99), which include magnificent stupas, monasteries, and shrines.  Reign and construction work  Ruwanveliseya, King Dutugamunu's most famous construction; it currently stands at over 90 metres in height and 91 diameter Aside from his many construction projects Dutugemunu's reign is memorable for his estrangement from his son, Saliya or Salirajakumara. The Prince fell in love with a girl called Agokamaladevi or Asokamala; unfortunately for all concerned she was of the Scavenger caste, one of the lowest castes in Sinhalese society. Saliya refused to give her up and rejected the throne. Though the Mahavamsa mentions no reconciliation, folk stories have the young couple eventually restored to the king's good graces. The king's reign also saw extensive contact between Sri Lanka and traders from the west, including Arabs, Persians, and possibly Romans Following his consolidation of his position Dutugemunu began a series of huge construction projects, many of which still survive in Anuradhapura today. As with nearly everything in Dutugemunu's life, each foundation comes with its own legend, many of which reveal the preoccupations and inclinations of ancient Sinhalese society. The first foundation mentioned in the Mahavamsa is the Maricavatti vihara, the modern Mirisavetiya. Legend has it that traveling to the shore of the Tank of Tissa with the 'women of the harem' for a water-festival, Dutugemunu planted his spear (which contained a sacred relic) in the soft ground. When preparing to return to the palace, he found that neither he, nor anyone in his retinue, could pull it out. Taking this as a sign he ordered the construction of a stupa over the spear. Dutugemunu also ordered the construction of the Lohapasada, or Brazen Palace, a nine-story chapter house for monks, which derived its name from its bright copper-tiled roof. Again, legend has it that the design for the palace was based on a building seen in one of the heavens by a group of monks, who drew the design with 'red arsenic on linen' and dispatched it to the king. Perhaps his most famous creation was the Ruwanweliseya, also known as the Great Stupa or and Swarnamalee Chetiya, to house the begging bowl of the Buddha. The construction was started on the full moon day of the month of Vesak (traditionally the date of the birth, enlightenment, and passing away of the Buddha) with the creation of a foundation of crushed rock. To hammer the stones into place elephants were used with their feet bound in leather. Dutugemunu is said to have overseen the work personally, being present at the construction of the relic chamber and the interring of the bowl itself. The dedication of a stupa is described in Chap. 29 of the Mahavamsa, which lists the visit of delegations from various parts of India, as well as a delegation of 30,000 monks from Alexandria of the Caucasus, led by the Indo-Greek monk Mahadharmaraksita. Other notable works include the construction of a stupa in Mundeshiwari, current day Bihar, India.  Spiritual relationship with Kataragama Deviyo  Stories relating to some of the king's constructions reflect a spiritual relationship with the Kataragama deviyo. Two such sites are Henakaduwa Purana Raja Maha Viharaya at Tangalle and Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya. During the period of preparations for war with King Elara, the Kataragama deity appeared in front of King Dutugemunu and gave him a sword for him to use in the war at the present day site of Henakaduwa temple (hena and kaduwa, meaning thunder and sword respectively in Sinhalese). After defeating Elara in single combat in the Battle of Vijithapura and subsequently regaining power in the country, the Kataragama deity appeared yet again before Dutugemunu while the latter was in meditation at Kiri Vehera, Kataragama. The victorious king asked the deity what should be done in return for the deity's help in winning the battle. The god replied by shooting an arrow in the direction of Wedihiti Kanda from Kiri Vehera and instructed Dutugemunu to build it a shrine where the arrow lands.  Death and succession  King Dutugemunu did not live to see his beloved Ruwanweliseya completed, dying before the plaster work was finished. The Mahavamsa dedicates an entire chapter to his death, which contains a poignant scene where the dying king is taken by palanquin to the vicinity of the incomplete stupa. There he also encounters his old colleague Theraputtbhya, now a monk. After some discussion of the mortality of men, the aged monarch passes away and is immediately reborn in the heavenly realm of Tusita. A common folk tale surrounding the death of King Dutugemunu is that as he was dying he was told that Ruwanweliseya was completed in order to keep him happy. The well-intentioned plan went awry, however, when Dutugemunu asked to be shown the finished building. His brother Tissa had the entire building draped in white cloth to present the illusion of whitewash, and due to his failing eyesight Dutugemunu did not spot the difference, dying convinced that the building was finished. Following his death Dutugemunu was succeeded by his brother Saddhatissa, rather than his disinherited son Saliya.

It was founded in 1869 and the brand name Staropramen, literally meaning ‚Äúold spring‚Äù, was registered in 1911. It is owned by Molson Coors and its products are exported to 37 different countries, mostly in Europe and North America. History Staropramen Brewery's history begins in 1869 when shares for a \\"Joint Stock Brewery in Sm√≠chov\\" were offered for sale. The brewery building was completed and beer first brewed in 1871. The Ostravar Brewery opened in 1898 followed a year later by the Bran√≠k brewery; these two breweries would later merge with Staropramen. Due to competition from other Prague breweries, the brand name Staropramen, which translates as ‚Äúold spring\\" (water source), was registered in 1911. After the First World War, all three breweries saw a period of sustained growth, and by the 1930s Staropramen was the largest brewery in Czechoslovakia. With socialism after the Second World War, all Czechoslovakian breweries were nationalised, including Staropramen. After socialism ended in 1989, the brewery, along with the Bran√≠k and Mƒõ≈°≈•an breweries, became in 1992 part of the Prague Breweries group (Pra≈æsk√© Pivovary), which by 1996 came under control of the Bass company. Bass brought Ostravar into the group in 1997, then in 2000 sold its brewing operations to Interbrew, which merged with AmBev in 2004 to form Inbev.

Controversy In September 2015, Carlsberg Group, which is involved in the import of Czech brand into Northern Europe, had ordered a recall of Staropramen draft beer from 680 Swedish pubs, after the beer caused bleeding and blisters in the mouth for two people. Both persons were involved in the distribution of beer, and the devalued beer did not go on sale. Two containers of draft beer had contained a highly corrosive cleaning agent instead of beer. The solution did not smell or taste like beer. Staropramen assured, that it had introduced a new mechanism that strengthens the control of the presence of cleaning solutions in the barrels.V pivn√≠ch sudech z≈Østal ƒçist√≠c√≠ prost≈ôedek, p≈ôiznal Staropramen.

He is the founder of the Red McCombs Automotive Group in San Antonio, Texas, a co-founder of Clear Channel Communications, former chairman of Constellis Group, a former owner of the San Antonio Spurs, San Antonio Force, Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Vikings, and the namesake of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. He is on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. He is also known for his philanthropy. In 2012, the San Antonio Express-News reported McCombs' net worth at $1.4 billion. He was ranked the 913th richest man in the world. Two other San Antonio men at the time, Charles Butt of the H-E-B supermarket chain and Rodney Lewis, a natural gas driller, finished above McCombs on the list.\\"Six Antonio billionaires make Forbes list\\", San Antonio Express-News, March 18, 2012, \\"Glance\\" section, p. 3 In 2017, Forbes placed the value of McCombs' fortune at $1.6 billion with a ranking of No. 1,290 on a list of the world's billionaires. Biography McCombs was born in rural Spur in Dickens County in West Texas. His nickname \\"Red\\" comes from his hair color.NSIDE Business. Nside Sa. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. His father was a mechanic who earned $25 per week but tithed through the First Baptist Church of Spur each week. McCombs recalled having seen his parents \\"share with those who had less, and the joy of giving never ceased to amaze me.\\"John Tedesco, \\"McCombs makes a lot and donates a lot\\", San Antonio Express-News, November 26, 2015 In 1958, McCombs and his fellow salesman, Austin Hemphill, moved to San Antonio to create Hemphill-McCombs Ford, which was the foundation for what ultimately became the Red McCombs Automotive Group. McCombs has served as chairman of the trustees at Southwestern University and chairman of the University of Texas's M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His particular interest in M. D. Anderson was accentuated in 1986, when he visited a dying friend undergoing treatment there. He expressed how he was overcome by the kindness of every employee he met at the hospital. The workers, he found, had been trained to offer compassion and solace to all who come through the doors. He joined the Anderson board and in 2005 donated $30 million to the hospital. The business school at the University of Texas was renamed the Red McCombs School of Business in recognition of his $50 million donation to the institution. The $50 million actually yielded $100 million in matching funds for new faculty positions, fellowships, and scholarships. He is the board chairman of Academi. McCombs is a member of the Alamo Endowment Board, which raises funds for the preservation and management of the Alamo Mission in downtown San Antonio. With the state purchasing three historic buildings in Alamo Plaza, McCombs said in October 2015 that he envisions an expansion program consistent with the reality of the Alamo story to enhance the overall experience of future visitors to the historic site.Scott Huddleston and Benjamin Olivo, \\"Next chapter in Alamo history now is waiting to be written: What buildings' purchase by state means still is to be seen\\", San Antonio Express-News, October 11, 2015 McCombs is a reformed alcoholic, who could \\"handle his social drinking\\" until the age of 48, when overcome with convulsions he went into a five-day coma at a medical facility in Houston. McCombs said in a Christmas 2016 interview, \\"God was good to me and for whatever reason wanted me to live, because I was really dead when I left in 1975 to go to Houston on that medical plane. They told Charline, 'Go ahead and start making arrangements because we are losing him.'\\" McCombs said that he recovered and never again had a desire for alcohol. The McCombs Foundation has donated more than $118 million to charity. It is operated by his daughters who work to keep overhead at a minimum. The foundation makes small donations too, such as $1,000 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which are rarely publicized. McCombs said that he is a large donor to charitable causes because \\"it makes me feel so good about doing it.\\" In 2017, McCombs filed a $1 million civil suit against seven of his former executives whom he alleged took \\"trade secrets\\" from McCombs' company to begin a competing firm in Houston, F4 Resources. Defendants in the suit include William \\"Bill\\" Forney, Jr., who worked with McCombs for forty-four years, former chief financial officer Ricky Halkin, vice president of operations Larry Wyont, vice president of land Charles Forney, and the vice president of geology, Philip Forney. McCombs had established McCombs Energy in Houston in 1998 by merging his 50 percent interest in his partnership with William Forney with other assets purchased from Forney. McCombs claims that his former associates, however, lowered the proper payout that he was due from his investments. McCombs said that the former executives shattered personal relationships of some four decades.Patrick Danner, \\"McCombs sues ex- executives: Suit claims taking of trade secrets, greed\\", San Antonio Express- News, April 1, 2017, pp. B5-B6. McCombs was married to Charline Hamblin from 1950 until December 12, 2019, when she died.San Antonio treasure, Charline McCombs passes away Sports ownership McCombs attributes construction of the HemisFair Arena as the essential development to the success of the Spurs. He contacted Lee Iacocca, then president of the Ford Motor Company, to seek funding for the arena to correspond with the 1968 World's Fair. At first, Iacocca offered only $250,000 for the purchase of an art object, and he scolded McCombs and ridiculed San Antonio as \\"that little old dusty ass town of yours down there [with] no political or economic significance to the Ford Motor Company.\\"Tom Orsborn, \\"There from Day One: McCombs recalls role as Spurs' founder\\", San Antonio Express-News, December 25, 2016, pp. SP10-SP12 McCombs persisted and asked U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to contact Henry Ford, II, and in a continued heated exchange even told Iacocca that Ford needed to improve the quality of its 1968 vehicles. McCombs located other investors, and the Dallas Chaparrals came to San Antonio five years later in 1973. McCombs realized the importance of television to sports events and saw the opportunity to bring San Antonio to a national stage. Under the McCombs administration the Spurs had their first superstar in George Gervin, called \\"The Iceman\\", who was recruited from the Virginia Squires. Two years after taking the Spurs into the NBA, McCombs sold off his stake in the Spurs and bought another former ABA team, the Denver Nuggets. He held onto the team until 1985, when he sold it to Sidney Shlenker. In 1998, McCombs bought the Minnesota Vikings for US$250 million. After an unsuccessful attempt to replace the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, McCombs sold the team to new (and current) owner Zygi Wilf before the 2005 football season. McCombs was also actively involved in thoroughbred racing and breeding for many years as a major partner in Walmac Farm, a leading American breeding farm, in Lexington, Kentucky. =Controversy= McCombs owns a piece of property surrounded by National Forest near Wolf Creek ski area, a resort in southern Colorado owned by the Pitcher family. McCombs has long wanted to develop a resort community on his property, a plan that has drawn opposition and lawsuits from environmentalists and surrounding communities. McCombs has been unsuccessful in his attempts to convince the court to remove a key roadblock preventing his proposed development. McCombs then attempted to build a casino resort at Navajo Canyon on Lake Powell. The local Navajo Nation chapters, local government officials, all unanimously rejected the casino proposal and any projects by Red McCombs. In 2013, McCombs was found by the United States Supreme Court to have engaged in a sham tax avoidance transaction and was therefore liable for a valuation misstatement penalty.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-562_k5fl.pdf McCombs severely criticized the 2014 University of Texas hire of Charlie Strong as football coach.

It has a population of approximately 2,100 residents, and residents may keep livestock. Lincoln Acres has a fire station and library. The community relies on the San Diego County Sheriff's Department to provide police protection. Sheriff Deputies from the Imperial Beach station police the neighborhood. Even though it has a post office, it shares its ZIP code, 91950, with National City. However the United States Postal Service lists the zip code 91947 as being located within Lincoln Acres for P.O. Box use. The community is in area code 619. History Lincoln Acres was first settled during the Great Depression, mainly by farmers from the Midwest, to have small farms. It was named after Abraham Lincoln. Over time the farms became residential homes, and the population became mostly Mexican Americans. By 1975, the community had largely expanded to its limits, and only saw an 11% growth of population from 1975 to 1995. Significant organizations and properties =La Vista Cemetery= The largest plot of land in Lincoln Acres is filled by the La Vista Cemetery. The cemetery has a large section that is considered an endowed cemetery, meaning money is set aside for regular maintenance and upkeep, and a non-endowed side, known as Rest Haven, where no money is set aside for maintenance, and therefore the families of those buried there are responsible for maintaining their grave sites. This means that in the Rest Haven side, there are tilted headstones and old, off-kilter wooden crosses marking the graves. People construct their own headstones for the inexpensive plots, creating a personal, individual experience for family and friends of those interred there.Personal plots  The San Diego Union-Tribune =Library= The first library in the community began in 1940. Lincoln Acres is served by a branch of the San Diego County Library system, and the previous building was originally built in 1945. It was purchased from the Civil Conservation Corps in Vista, and moved to its final location in 1961. At the beginning of construction of the new library building, the branch was the smallest in the County Library system. On August 6, 2010, ground was broken for a new library which would be more than three times larger than the old location. It opened in 2013, and tripled the size of the branch from its 854 square feet original size. It includes a reading room named for a late volunteer of the library, who was killed in Chula Vista in 2007; a scholarship is also awarded in his name yearly to a child within the community. After it was completed, Chicano Park muralist Sal Barajas worked with members of the community to create a mural on the new building. =Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District= While Lincoln Acres relies on the County of San Diego for governmental services, there is one elected body that is exclusive to Lincoln Acres; the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District. In 1945 the fire district was formed, and a firehouse was erected next to the site of the library. , the fire district owns no fire trucks nor has any firefighters on its payroll. This special district has a board of three members who have the sole task of administering a $155,473-a-year contract with the National City Fire Department, which provides fire protection to the community. The contract is paid for by Lincoln Acres landowners' property taxes. After the November 2006 elections, only one person was currently serving on the fire district board: Butch Fimpel. On January 9, 2007, the County Board of Supervisors appointed Mary Martinez to the board. Martinez had been previously serving on the board, but did not run for re-election in November 2006. The third remaining seat on the board remains vacant. The board meets monthly and the positions are unpaid, though in the past the board members were paid $20 per meeting. In 2002 there was an attempt to dissolve the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District, \\"Proposition R,\\" but the measure failed when 156 Lincoln Acres residents voted against dissolution, defeating the measure by 62%. Only 29% of the community's 882 registered voters went to the polls that day, but many of those who did vote feared dissolution of the fire district would lead to the community's annexation to National City.Enthusiasm to serve on board of fire district hasn't been so hot  The San Diego Union-Tribune References External links * Category:Unincorporated communities in San Diego County, California Category:South Bay (San Diego County) Category:Unincorporated communities in California ","title":"Lincoln Acres, California"},{"id":"855737","text":"Asselin objects to the burial of William the Conqueror in a church he claims was built on his unlawfully obtained land: \\"the ground upon which you are standing, was the site of my father's dwelling.

The in Guernsey requires that a Grace be said after the Lord's Prayer: Furthermore, the grievance must be put in writing and lodged at the within 24 hours. Limitations can be overruled. For instance, in 1778 the States of Guernsey decided to erect 15 loophole towers at various points on the coast to impede any French incursion on the island. Although most of the towers were built on the Commons, or on public land above the high-water mark, three towers were to be built on private land. The States were of the opinion that the project was of such importance that if necessary they would exercise eminent domain, \\"notwithstanding any or any opposition whatsoever\\". A Clameur can also be denied by a court. In 2010, Guernsey's Deputy Bailiff denied a couple's attempt to invoke the Haro, in a potential eviction action by a bank that lent the couple money to build a home. Recent uses The Clameur was raised in Guernsey in December 2016 to block the forcible removal of a derelict Kia Sportage from private land. Earlier that same year, a threat to use the Haro was issued, in an effort to stop the redevelopment of a garden and war memorial in Guernsey. On 14 August 2018 local resident Rosie Henderson attempted to use the Clameur to stop the narrowing of the South Esplanade in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, which she said would be a danger to both pedestrians and motorists. The court refused to register her clameur, because she does not own the land in question.

It broadcasts a country music format, with an emphasis on recordings released since the 1990s. From 1968 to 2008, WSM-FM was the sister of the clear-channel WSM. The station is now owned by Cumulus Media and no longer has any organizational relation to the AM. A transmitter site is co-located with the station's former television partner WSMV in West Nashville, and its studios are located in Nashville's Music Row district. History WSM-FM began broadcasting on November 1, 1962 as WLWM, owned by C. Webber Parrish (d/b/a Barlane Broadcasting Corporation), a local Nashville businessman.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 In late 1967 ownership of the station was transferred to a subsidiary of The National Life and Accident Insurance Company, owners of WSM (AM), and the next year the station's call letters were changed to WSM-FM. This marked the return of the WSM-FM call sign after an absence of 17 years. In 1941, National Life had established the first fully licensed commercial FM station in the United States. Initially known as W47NV. This original WSM-FM was shut down in 1951 and its license returned to the FCC. After a short period of simulcasting the AM station, beginning in 1969 WSM-FM returned to the easy listening format previously aired by WLWM. =\\"SM95\\", 1976‚Äì1983= WSM-FM logo from the early '80s In 1976, National Life changed (despite some management misgivings) to a soft-rock playlist that was very broad by today's standards; during those years, the station adopted the branding \\"SM95\\". In demographics, the station went after an audience of people in their twenties and thirties who, obviously enough, wanted something more musically interesting than easy listening but disliked the harder and louder rock that was becoming popular among teenagers then. SM95 was one of the few outlets in the nation for up-and-coming singer-songwriters to get airplay without having a smash record elsewhere; some of the artists were in fact Nashville-based, reflecting the growth in non-country artists recording there. One might consider the moderately eclectic format a forerunner of the \\"adult alternative\\" playlists that achieved some success years later, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Former SM95 disc jockey Nick Archer operated a Live 365 internet-only streaming re-creation of the station's format (featuring the original station IDs and jingles) from November 2001 until February 2008, almost as long as the original broadcast station's run. Archer attempted it again in 2014, mixing in newer music, but it was not as successful. =Country music format, 1983‚Äìpresent= 95.5 The Wolf logo 2008‚Äì2009 The ratings of SM95 began to decline‚Äîand thus advertiser appeal‚Äîas its audience began aging in the early 1980s. By 1983, some four years after the conversion of the AM to a full-time country format, management decided to bring the FM in line with the AM, and flipped the format to country (with an emphasis on current hits, instead of the AM's emphasis on oldies). After the sale of WSM, Inc. to Gaylord Broadcasting, the new owner moved the studios of both AM and FM to an outlying building at the Opryland Hotel complex at that time, from their 1970s home on Knob Road in west Nashville, where former sister TV station WSMV still operates today. In the 1990s, WSM-FM operated from a studio inside Opryland USA theme park, which visitors could view through a glass window. Following the theme park's demolition, the station moved into a renovated guestroom at Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. The station had an auxiliary studio at the Wildhorse Saloon downtown, and later at Opry Mills. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, 95.5 FM was a highly competitive, yet usually #2 (behind rival WSIX-FM), country station. For much of the 1980s and 1990s, the station was branded as \\"Nashville 95\\". However, upon the arrival of a fourth country station in the market in 1999 (WKDF, which had played rock music since the mid-1970s), WSM-FM fell to a distant third place, and sometimes fell to fourth behind then-sister WSM. In 2001, WSM-FM attempted to differentiate from the other FM country outlets by shifting to a format consisting mostly of live performances provided by the artists' labels or those within the WSM archives (such as Opry performances and in-studio appearances). The station was known during this era as \\"Live 95\\", and also simulcast the Opry live every Friday and Saturday night. After abandoning this approach to return to a traditional method of programming, and until the end of the Gaylord era, the station was called \\"Back to Back Country 95.5 WSM-FM\\". In 2003, WSM-FM (along with sister news/talk/sports station WWTN) was sold to Cumulus Media. The lineup at the time consisted of Katie and Carp in the mornings, Frank Series middays, David Hughes afternoons (best known for his \\"Church day\\" antics on Wednesdays) and Su-Anna evenings. The station continued to broadcast from a first-floor hotel room in the Gaylord hotel until mid-2004 under the direction of program director Lee Logan. The studios and offices were eventually moved to Cumulus' existing property on Music Circle East, in Nashville's Music Row district. In September 2004, with new program director Jon Sebastian, the station adopted a revised country format (branded as \\"95.5 The Wolf\\") that included some Southern rock music. After some initial ratings success, the station fell to a consistent third place behind WKDF and WSIX, and a more traditional country approach was once again employed. New program director Buddy Van Aresdale took the helm. The ratings steadily increased before Van Aresdale left for greener pastures. Another program director, Kevin King, took charge, this time with 'consultant' Jan Jeffries, a long time friend of the Dickey family. On December 16, 2010, while rival station WSIX was in the midst of a reboot and stunting with nonstop Christmas music, WSM-FM itself relaunched, dropping \\"The Wolf\\" moniker. The station returned to using its heritage call letters, while offering a mainstream country playlist that included the top country hits of the day, as well as a heavy reliance on familiar hits dating back to the early 1990s. In 2012, due to the bankruptcy of Citadel Broadcasting and subsequent acquisition by Cumulus, WSM-FM and rival WKDF became sister stations, operating from the same building, yet still competing for the same mainstream country audience. Their operations were streamlined in January 2014 with the hiring of a common program director. WKDF adopted Cumulus' \\"Nash FM\\" moniker and format in February 2014, six months ahead of a similar change to come on WSM-FM. On August 15, 2014, the station rebranded as \\"95.5 Nash Icon\\", thus serving as the nominal flagship station of Cumulus' new Nash Icon brand, a spin-off of Nash FM that focuses on more familiar traditional country titles ranging back to the 1980s, as well as a focus on new music by more traditional-sounding artists. The format minimizes the amount of talking by the air personalities and places a heavier emphasis on the variety and amount of music. The Nash Icon radio format is a by-product of a joint venture between Cumulus and Big Machine Records to launch and operate the Nash Icon Records label. In January 2015, WSM-FM became syndicated nationally on Westwood One's offering of the Nash Icon format, which is distributed to several Cumulus Nash Icon-branded stations, as well as some non-Cumulus-owned subscribing stations. The personalities provide a generic non-live or local presence on the radio dial. =Grand Ole Opry schedule conflicts= In past years, when WSM had the rights to broadcast Vanderbilt Commodore football and basketball games and Atlanta Braves baseball, it had WSM-FM air them whenever they took place on Friday or Saturday nights, in order not to preempt the live Grand Ole Opry shows on AM 650. Until the end of the 2003‚Äì08 Cumulus operating agreement, WSM-FM also aired NASCAR broadcasts under the same circumstances.

Prior to 2004, the subfamily Latinae, which contained three genera, was placed within the Centropomidae; this has since been raised to the family level and renamed Latidae because a cladistic analysis showed the old Centropomidae to be paraphyletic. This has left Centropomus as the only remaining genus in this family. These are popular game and food fish. Dating from the upper Cretaceous, the centropomids are of typical percoid shape, distinguished by having two-part dorsal fins, a lateral line that extends onto the tail, and frequently, a concave shape to the head. They range from in length and are found in tropical and subtropical waters. The snook species range in maximum length from about , with maximum recorded weights of 1.0 ‚Äì 26 kg (2.2 ‚Äì 57 lb). Occurring in a variety of habitats ranging from coral reefs to estuaries and mangrove swamps, the snooks are carnivorous, feeding primarily on crustaceans and other fishes. Many of the snooks are important as commercial food fish and as game fish. The generic name Centropomus derives from the Greek Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ (centre, in this sense \\"sting\\") and œÄœéŒºŒ± (cover, plug, operculum). R√≥balo or snook are world-renowned game fish of the family Centropomidae and genus Centropomus that are much sought after by fly-fishing enthusiasts and sportfishing charters. Six Atlantic and six Pacific Ocean species are currently recognized as scientifically valid. All are known to inhabit Central America and all are excellent gamefish. No evidence has been found of the individual species crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific or vice versa through the Panama Canal. All snook species are capable of inhabiting both fresh and saltwater and are known to seasonally occupy Gatun Lake, which forms a water bridge connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as an integral part of the Panama Canal. Of the 12 species, only four are known to reach sizes in excess of 10 lb ‚Äì two Atlantic species (C. undecimalis and C. poeyi) and two Pacific species (C. viridis and C. nigrescens). The eight species of smaller snooks usually grow to less than 6 lb and can be readily distinguished by from the four larger species by their noticeably longer anal spine, anal fin configuration, and body shape. The four large species are immediately recognizable by their more streamlined appearance given by their longer, narrower body shape. Many individual species bear a close resemblance to one another, although they may be from the same or different oceans; identification is better left up to experts. The two Atlantic large species (C. undecimalis and C. poeyi) are virtually identical in appearance. They can usually only be distinguished by the number of gill rakers each possesses. The robalo or common snook (C. undecimalis) commonly has 11 to 13 nonrudimentary gill rakers and the Mexican snook (C. poeyi) is most often found to possess 15 to 18 nonrudimentary gill rakers. The Pacific robalo nato or white snook (C. viridis) is also a dead ringer for the common snook. The distinguishing feature is also the nonrudimentary gill raker count with 13 to 15 for the white snook. They act, breed, grow, and fight virtually the same. Curiously, laboratory-reared specimens of the common snook showed meristic variations in vertebrae, fin ray, and gill raker numbers not observed in specimens from the wild. These variations are suspected to be due to diet and growth rates. Large robalo caught in Lake Gatun invariably cause a wealth of confusion. The IGFA requires verification of the species by a designated authority for world- record claims. The two Pacific species of large robalo are somewhat easier to distinguish. The robalo redondo or black snook (C. nigrescens) can be differentiated by three visually apparent characteristics when compared to the C. viridis # The body of C. nigrescens, while similarly elongated, is rounder and heavier in general appearance, being thicker through the middle than C. viridis. # The head of C. nigrescens is bigger and the undershot jaw, characteristic of all r√≥balo, is far less pronounced than in C. viridis. # Most importantly, the fourth dorsal spine of C. nigrescens is taller than the third. In both species, the first two dorsal spines are hardly noticeable. In large specimens, these first two spines are only a quarter of an inch long, while the third spine is over two inches in length. Therefore, if the first long dorsal spine is longer than all the others, it is a C. viridis, but if the first long dorsal spine is shorter than the second long dorsal spine it is a C. nigrescens.

Confirmation bias can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis, and overlook information that argues against it.Goldstein, Bruce. \\"Cognitive Psychology\\". Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2011, p. 374 It is a significant threat to a study's internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a double-blind experimental design. It may include conscious or unconscious influences on subject behavior including creation of demand characteristics that influence subjects, and altered or selective recording of experimental results themselves.  Overview  The experimenter may introduce cognitive bias into a study in several ways. In what is called the observer- expectancy effect, the experimenter may subtly communicate their expectations for the outcome of the study to the participants, causing them to alter their behavior to conform to those expectations. Such observer bias effects are near-universal in human data interpretation under expectation and in the presence of imperfect cultural and methodological norms that promote or enforce objectivity. The classic example of experimenter bias is that of \\"Clever Hans\\", an Orlov Trotter horse claimed by his owner von Osten to be able to do arithmetic and other tasks. As a result of the large public interest in Clever Hans, philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, along with his assistant Oskar Pfungst, investigated these claims. Ruling out simple fraud, Pfungst determined that the horse could answer correctly even when von Osten did not ask the questions. However, the horse was unable to answer correctly when either it could not see the questioner, or if the questioner themselves was unaware of the correct answer: When von Osten knew the answers to the questions, Hans answered correctly 89% of the time. However, when von Osten did not know the answers, Hans guessed only 6% of questions correctly. Pfungst then proceeded to examine the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse's taps approached the right answer, the questioner's posture and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap. This provided a cue that the horse had learned to use as a reinforced cue to stop tapping. Experimenter-bias also influences human subjects. As an example, researchers compared performance of two groups given the same task (rating portrait pictures and estimating how successful each individual was on a scale of -10 to 10), but with different experimenter expectations. In one group, (\\"Group A\\"), experimenters were told to expect positive ratings while in another group, (\\"Group B\\"), experimenters were told to expect negative ratings. Data collected from Group A was a significant and substantially more optimistic appraisal than the data collected from Group B. The researchers suggested that experimenters gave subtle but clear cues with which the subjects complied.Rosenthal R. Experimenter effects in behavioral research. New York, NY: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1966. 464 p. Prevention Double blind techniques may be employed to combat bias by causing the experimenter and subject to be ignorant of which condition data flows from. It might be thought that, due to the central limit theorem of statistics, collecting more independent measurements will improve the precision of estimates, thus decreasing bias. However, this assumes that the measurements are statistically independent. In the case of experimenter bias, the measures share correlated bias: simply averaging such data will not lead to a better statistic but may merely reflect the correlations among the individual measurements and their non-independent nature.

Following the publication of the book Dalrymple was called to brief both the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the White House on the lessons to be learned from Afghan history. Dalrymple was also the curator of Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707‚Äì1857, a major show of the late Mughal and Company School painting for the Asia Society in New York, which ran from February to May 2012.Princes and Painters, Asia Society retrieved 4 October 2012. A catalogue of this exhibit co-edited by Dalrymple with Yuthika Sharma was published by Penguin in 2012 under the same name. His most recent book, published in 2019, is The Anarchy, a history of the Indian Subcontinent during the period from 1739 to 1803, which saw the collapse of the Mughal imperial system, rise of the Maratha imperial confederacy, and the militarisation and rise of power of the East India Company. TV and radio Dalrymple has written and presented the six-part television series Stones of the Raj (Channel 4, August 1997), the three-part Indian Journeys (BBC, August 2002) and Sufi Soul (Channel 4, Nov 2005). The six-part Stones of the Raj documents the stories behind some of British India's colonial architecture starting with Lahore (16 August 1997), Calcutta (23 August 1997), The French Connection (30 August 1997), The Fatal Friendship (6 September 1997), Surrey in Tibet (13 September 1997), and concluded with The Magnificent Ruin (20 September 1997).

Career In 1972, Rowling began working for Tana Oil and Gas, which was owned by his father, Reese Rowling, and William E Colson. In 1989 Texaco acquired Tana for $476 million, thereby providing money that was used to form TRT Holdings. Five years later, TRT Holdings sold Corpus Christi National Bank to NationsBank for $131 million. TRT Holdings would later purchase Omni Hotels for $500 million and Gold's Gym for $180 million. In August 2010, Rowling made the winning bid to acquire the bankrupt Amelia Island Plantation Resort for $67.1 million. In July 2013, Rowling purchased six resorts from KSL Resorts including The Homestead 1766 in Hot Springs, Virginia. Rowling served as a regent to the University of Texas System until February 2009 when he resigned over a controversy regarding bonuses paid to the UTIMCO investment staff. Governor Rick Perry and Texas state senators had sought to go back on compensation agreements with the staff. Unwilling to break the contracts and disgusted by their grandstanding, Rowling quit during a Texas Senate Finance Committee meeting and followed it up a day later with a formal letter of resignation As of May 2017, he is worth US$6.7 billion.

The generic name is also used as a common name, lates, for many of the species. All species are predatory, and the Nile perch (L. niloticus), in particular, has become infamous as an invasive species introduced into the East African Lake Victoria, where many native cichlids now are extinct. In contrast to the Nile perch, several members of the genus Lates with relatively restricted African or Asian distributions are themselves considered threatened. Etymology The generic name Lates derives from the Latin latƒìre (to be hidden). Description These fishes range in size from less than in maximum overall length, the largest species reaching weights up to . They all have the characteristic centropomid shape, with the two-part dorsal fin and general percoid form. All species are carnivorous, preying on aquatic invertebrates and other fish in a wide variety of habitats. Distribution and habitat The greatest species diversity is in the Rift Valley lakes, with four endemic to Tanganyika (L. angustifrons shown), one to Albert and one to Turkana These fishes are native to freshwater and marine waters of Africa, Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean.

With the metric signature, the gravitational part of the action is given as :S = {1 \\\\over 2\\\\kappa} \\\\int R \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^4x, where g=\\\\det(g_{\\\\mu u}) is the determinant of the metric tensor matrix, R is the Ricci scalar, and \\\\kappa = 8\\\\pi Gc^{-4} is the Einstein gravitational constant (G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light in vacuum). If it converges, the integral is taken over the whole spacetime. If it does not converge, S is no longer well-defined, but a modified definition where one integrates over arbitrarily large, relatively compact domains, still yields the Einstein equation as the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action. The action was first proposed by David Hilbert in 1915.  Discussion  Deriving equations of motion from an action has several advantages. First, it allows for easy unification of general relativity with other classical field theories (such as Maxwell theory), which are also formulated in terms of an action. In the process, the derivation identifies a natural candidate for the source term coupling the metric to matter fields. Moreover, symmetries of the action allow for easy identification of conserved quantities through Noether's theorem. In general relativity, the action is usually assumed to be a functional of the metric (and matter fields), and the connection is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The Palatini formulation of general relativity assumes the metric and connection to be independent, and varies with respect to both independently, which makes it possible to include fermionic matter fields with non-integer spin. The Einstein equations in the presence of matter are given by adding the matter action to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Derivation of Einstein field equations Suppose that the full action of the theory is given by the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert term plus a term \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M} describing any matter fields appearing in the theory. The action principle then tells us that to recover a physical law, we must demand that the variation of this action with respect to the inverse metric be zero, yielding :\\\\begin{align} 0 &= \\\\delta S \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa} \\\\frac{\\\\delta (\\\\sqrt{-g}R)}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} + \\\\frac{\\\\delta (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M})}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} \\\\right] \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^4x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\delta R}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} + \\\\frac{R}{\\\\sqrt{-g}} \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g}}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} } \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{-g}} \\\\frac{\\\\delta (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M})}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} \\\\right] \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}^4x \\\\end{align}. Since this equation should hold for any variation \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}, it implies that \\\\+ \\\\frac{R}{\\\\sqrt{-g}} \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g}}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} = -2\\\\kappa \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{-g}} \\\\frac{\\\\delta (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M})}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}}}} is the equation of motion for the metric field. The right hand side of this equation is (by definition) proportional to the stress-energy tensor, :T_{\\\\mu u} := \\\\frac{-2}{\\\\sqrt{-g}}\\\\frac{\\\\delta (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M})}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} = -2 \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M}}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}} + g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{M}. To calculate the left hand side of the equation we need the variations of the Ricci scalar R and the determinant of the metric. These can be obtained by standard textbook calculations such as the one given below, which is strongly based on the one given in . =Variation of the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the Ricci scalar= To calculate the variation of the Ricci scalar we calculate first the variation of the Riemann curvature tensor, and then the variation of the Ricci tensor. So, the Riemann curvature tensor is defined as :{R^\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma}- \\\\partial_ u\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} + \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\lambda} \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{ u\\\\sigma} - \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\lambda}\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}. Since the Riemann curvature depends only on the Levi-Civita connection \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu u}, the variation of the Riemann tensor can be calculated as :\\\\delta{R^\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} - \\\\partial_ u\\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} + \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\lambda} \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{ u\\\\sigma} + \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\lambda} \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{ u\\\\sigma} - \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\lambda} \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} -\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\lambda} \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}. Now, since \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} is the difference of two connections, it is a tensor and we can thus calculate its covariant derivative, : abla_\\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} \\\\right ) = \\\\partial_\\\\mu (\\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma}) + \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\lambda} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{ u\\\\sigma} -\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu u} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\lambda\\\\sigma} - \\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\lambda}. We can now observe that the expression for the variation of Riemann curvature tensor above is equal to the difference of two such terms, :\\\\delta{R^\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu u} = abla_\\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} \\\\right) - abla_ u \\\\left( \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\right). We may now obtain the variation of the Ricci curvature tensor simply by contracting two indices of the variation of the Riemann tensor, and get the Palatini identity: :\\\\delta R_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\equiv \\\\delta {R^\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma\\\\rho u} = abla_\\\\rho \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} \\\\right) - abla_ u \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} \\\\right). The Ricci scalar is defined as :R = g^{\\\\sigma u} R_{\\\\sigma u}. Therefore, its variation with respect to the inverse metric g^{\\\\sigma u} is given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta R &= R_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta g^{\\\\sigma u} + g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta R_{\\\\sigma u}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= R_{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta g^{\\\\sigma u} + abla_\\\\rho \\\\left( g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} - g^{\\\\sigma\\\\rho} \\\\delta \\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} In the second line we used the metric compatibility of the covariant derivative, abla_\\\\sigma g^{\\\\mu u} = 0, and the previously obtained result for the variation of the Ricci curvature (in the second term, renaming the dummy indices \\\\rho and u to \\\\mu and \\\\rho respectively). The last term, : abla_\\\\rho \\\\left ( g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} - g^{\\\\sigma\\\\rho}\\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\right ), i.e. abla_\\\\rho A^{\\\\rho} \\\\equiv A^{\\\\lambda}{}_{;\\\\lambda} with A^{\\\\rho}=g^{\\\\sigma u} \\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho_{ u\\\\sigma} - g^{\\\\sigma\\\\rho}\\\\delta\\\\Gamma^\\\\mu_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}, multiplied by \\\\sqrt{-g}, becomes a total derivative, since for any vector A^{\\\\lambda} and any tensor density \\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\,A^{\\\\lambda} we have: :\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, A^\\\\lambda_{;\\\\lambda} = (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, A^{\\\\lambda})_{;\\\\lambda} = (\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, A^\\\\lambda)_{,\\\\lambda} or \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, abla_\\\\mu A^\\\\mu = abla_\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, A^\\\\mu\\\\right) = \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, A^\\\\mu\\\\right) and thus by Stokes' theorem only yields a boundary term when integrated. The boundary term is in general non-zero, because the integrand depends not only on \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}, but also on its partial derivatives \\\\partial_\\\\lambda \\\\, \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\equiv \\\\delta\\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\lambda g^{\\\\mu u}; see the article Gibbons‚ÄìHawking‚ÄìYork boundary term for details. However when the variation of the metric \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} vanishes in a neighbourhood of the boundary or when there is no boundary, this term does not contribute to the variation of the action. And we thus obtain = R_{\\\\mu u}.}} at events not in the closure of the boundary. =Variation of the determinant= Jacobi's formula, the rule for differentiating a determinant, gives: :\\\\delta g = \\\\delta \\\\det(g_{\\\\mu u}) = g g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu u}, or one could transform to a coordinate system where g_{\\\\mu u} is diagonal and then apply the product rule to differentiate the product of factors on the main diagonal. Using this we get :\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g} = -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{-g}}\\\\delta g = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left( g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left( g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\right) In the last equality we used the fact that :g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} = -g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\delta g_{\\\\mu u} which follows from the rule for differentiating the inverse of a matrix :\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} = - g^{\\\\mu\\\\alpha} \\\\left( \\\\delta g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\right) g^{\\\\beta u}. Thus we conclude that \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\sqrt{-g}}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u} } = -\\\\frac{1}{2} g_{\\\\mu u}.}} =Equation of motion= Now that we have all the necessary variations at our disposal, we can insert () and () into the equation of motion () for the metric field to obtain which is the Einstein field equations, and :\\\\kappa = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4} has been chosen such that the non- relativistic limit yields the usual form of Newton's gravity law, where G is the gravitational constant (see here for details).

While the \\"technical crew\\" includes all persons other than performers involved with the production, such as those who build and take down the sets and place the lighting, the term \\"running crew\\" is generally limited to those who work during an actual performance. The term is typically not applied to crew or department heads, although there are exceptions. The running crew may include performers if they also function in technical capacities while offstage. Crew positions A typical running crew will include any or all of the following positions, depending on the nature and size of the production, and the complexity of the technical requirements. Each position is organized by the most common title; depending on the country, type of production, and producing organization, different titles may be used for the same position. =Stage management= * Assistant stage manager: Assists the stage manager in their duties. Generally, one assistant stage manager is in charge of running backstage operations during a show. * Props: responsible for maintenance and placement of hand props before scenes as well as their subsequent retrieval after the scene. * Call boy: responsible for alerting actors and actresses of their entrances in time for them to appear on stage, on cue. =Lighting= * Light board operator: operates the [stage lightinglighting control system]. Sometimes this is integrated with the show control system. * Deck Electrician: responsible for placing, connecting, and/or operating stage lighting units, such as stage lights. Sometimes, they are necessary to have during scene changes, in the case of moving set pieces with lighting equipment inside. Typically, more than one will be backstage. * Master Electrician: responsible for the maintenance and operation of dimming & power distribution systems during a performance, including \\"hot\\" or \\"live\\" patching. Occasionally, some of these duties could also be delegated to the run crew's deck electricians. * Spotlight Operator (or follow spot operator/dome operator): operates a type of lighting instrument called a follow spot, which allows a performer to be lit evenly no matter where on stage they may go. It can typically be found in the lighting booth, along with the light board op. Also, some theaters have followed spots located above a false ceiling, on the catwalk. =Sound= * Sound operator (A1): operates the sound board and/or audio control system specified by the sound designer, computerized or otherwise. Sometimes this is integrated with the show control system. There can be multiple soundboard ops. * Mic wrangler (A2): manages microphones and maintains headsets as a show runs. Usually, there are several mic wranglers located backstage, in the wings, with the running crew. =Stage= * Flymen (or fly crew/rail crew): operate the fly system, a system of ropes or wires, pulleys, and counterweights by means of which scenery is \\"flown\\" in and out (down and up, respectively) during scene changes. * Stagehand: A technician responsible for moving scenery at the stage level, by manually carrying or rolling set pieces (e.g., scenery wagons) between the stage and the wings. This can include carrying on and off furniture, props, or scenery. =Wardrobe= * Wardrobe: A \\"dresser\\" (who works for Wardrobe) is responsible for maintenance and placement of costumes, as well as assisting performers in getting into and out of costumes. * Makeup: responsible for applying or assisting in the application of face and body paints, wigs and hairpieces, etc.  References  Category:Stage crew Category:Stagecraft Category:Theatrical occupations ","title":"Running crew"},{"id":"855782","text":"Vivian Nicholson (born Vivian Asprey; 3 April 1936 ‚Äì 11 April 2015) was a British woman who became famous when she told the media she would \\"spend, spend, spend\\" after her husband Keith won ¬£152,319 (equivalent to ¬£3,362,478.00 adjusted for inflation to 2019) on the football pools in 1961.Bulent Yusuf \\"What Happened Next?\\" The Observer, 6 July 2003 Nicholson became the subject of tabloid news stories for many years due to her and Keith's subsequent rapid spending of their fortune and her later chaotic life.

By her own admission, she found it hard to cope with the psychological effects of the money Keith had won. Having no concept of how to manage and save money, Viv Nicholson admitted to becoming so consumed by spending money that she likened it at one point to an addiction to narcotics. Due to her out-of-control spending, she came to feel distanced from the people she had lived among, who in turn could no longer relate to her,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/celebrity- obituaries/11531195/Viv-Nicholson-pools-winner-obituary.html and she developed an ever greater longing for a much more affluent lifestyle.

Difficulties In 1970, she relocated to Malta, but the following year, after she was arrested for assaulting a policeman, the Maltese authorities deported her, and she returned to Britain. She also remarried, but the marriage did not last. Her new husband, Brian Wright, later died in a car crash. She entered a mental home to escape from her next husband, a man named Graham Ellison, who abused her during the four days they lived together; the marriage lasted 13 weeks. Her fifth and last husband, Gary Shaw, died of a drug overdose. Her alcoholism became serious during her wealthy years, but continued for many years after she lost all her money. She eventually became sober. She made many attempts to regain both her public profile and her lost wealth, such as recording a song (titled \\"Spend Spend Spend\\", written by her brother) and appearing in a strip club singing \\"Big Spender\\".https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/12/spend-spend- spend-football-pools-winner-viv-nicholson-dies-aged-79 None of these efforts proved successful.

Working in Washington, D.C., Kenneth Noland was a pioneer of the color field movement in the late 1950s. Color field painting is a style of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to abstract expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering abstract expressionists. Color field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting \\"color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.\\". During the late 1950s and 1960s, color field painters emerged in parts of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the United States, particularly New York, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature.\\"Colour Field Painting\\".

During the late 1940s and early 1950s Clement Greenberg was the first art critic to suggest and identify a dichotomy between differing tendencies within the Abstract Expressionist canon. Taking issue with Harold Rosenberg (another important champion of Abstract Expressionism), who wrote of the virtues of action painting in his article \\"American Action Painters\\" published in the December 1952 issue of ARTnews,Harold Rosenberg .

Greenberg observed another tendency toward all-over color or Color Field in the works of several of the so-called 'first generation' Abstract Expressionists.Color As Field: American Painting. The New York Times. Retrieved December 7, 2008. Mark Rothko was one of the painters that Greenberg referred to as a Color Field painter exemplified by Magenta, Black, Green on Orange, although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any label. For Rothko, color was \\"merely an instrument.\\" In a sense, his best known works ‚Äì the \\"multiforms\\" and his other signature paintings ‚Äì are, in essence, the same expression, albeit one of purer (or less concrete or definable, depending on the interpretation) means, which is that of the same \\"basic human emotions,\\" as his earlier surrealistic mythological paintings. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for \\"tragedy, ecstasy and doom\\". By 1958, whatever spiritual expression Rothko meant to portray on canvas, it was growing increasingly darker. His bright reds, yellows and oranges of the early 1950s subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks. His final series of paintings from the mid-1960s were gray, and black with white borders, seemingly abstract landscapes of an endless bleak, tundra-like, unknown country. Rothko, during the mid-1940s, was in the middle of a crucial period of transition, and he had been impressed by Clyfford Still's abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still's native North Dakota. In 1947, during a subsequent semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art (known today as the San Francisco Art Institute), Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum or school. Still was considered one of the foremost Color Field painters ‚Äì his non-figurative paintings are largely concerned with the juxtaposition of different colors and surfaces. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been \\"torn\\" off the painting, revealing the colors underneath, reminiscent of stalactites and primordial caverns. Still's arrangements are irregular, jagged, and pitted with heavy texture and sharp surface contrast as seen above in 1957D1. Another artist whose best known works relate to both abstract expressionism and to color field painting is Robert Motherwell. Motherwell's style of abstract expressionism, characterized by loose opened fields of painterly surfaces accompanied by loosely drawn and measured lines and shapes, was influenced by both Joan Mir√≥ and by Henri Matisse.De Antonio, Emile.

Robert Motherwell's Elegy to The Spanish Republic series embodies both tendencies, while Motherwell's Open Series of the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s places him firmly within the Color Field camp.\\"Open Series #121\\".

Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940‚Äì1970, p. 44, Abbeville Press 1984, alluding to several of his own series of paintings that reflect Matisse's influence, most notably his Open Series that come closest to classic Color Field painting. Barnett Newman is considered one of the major figures in abstract expressionism and one of the foremost of the color field painters. Newman's mature work is characterized by areas of color pure and flat separated by thin vertical lines, or \\"zips\\" as Newman called them, exemplified by Vir Heroicus Sublimis in the collection of MoMA. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the Onement series (from 1948) seen here.Barnett Newman The zips define the spatial structure of the painting while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition. Although Newman's paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called Adam and Eve (see Adam and Eve), and there are also Uriel (1954) and Abraham (1949), a very dark painting, which, in addition to being the name of a biblical patriarch, was also the name of Newman's father, who had died in 1947. Newman's late works, such as the Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases. Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt and Arshile Gorky (in his last works) were among the prominent abstract expressionist painters that Greenberg identified as being connected to Color Field painting in the 1950s and 1960s.\\"Smithsonian Museum Exhibits Color Field Painting\\", retrieved December 7, 2008 Although Pollock is closely associated with action painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly 'touch' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvases to the large-scale Water Lilies of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic Michael Fried, and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works ‚Äì his drip paintings ‚Äì read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic drip painting period of 1947‚Äì1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed Number 12, 1952, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66 Retrieved May 6, 2011Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project Retrieved May 6, 2011 While Arshile Gorky is considered to be one of the founding fathers of Abstract Expressionism and a Surrealist, he was also one of the first painters of the New York School who used the technique of 'staining'. Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in his many of his paintings as grounds. In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941 and 1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is James Brooks. Brooks frequently used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his oil paint in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, Sam Francis' style of large-scale bright Abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color Field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the Abstract Expressionist rubric, action painting and Color Field painting. Having seen Jackson Pollock's 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, Helen Frankenthaler began to produce stain paintings in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is Mountains and Sea (as seen below). She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.\\"'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way\\" Retrieved 3 August 2010 Frankenthaler also studied with Hans Hofmann. Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in The Gate, 1959‚Äì1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. Hofmann was a young artist working in Paris who painted there before World War I. Hofmann worked in Paris with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland were both profoundly influenced by Frankenthaler's stain paintings after visiting her studio in New York City. Returning to Washington, DC., they began to produce the major works that created the color field movement in the late 1950s.Fenton, Terry. \\"Morris Louis\\". sharecom.ca.

Among Louis's major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series are the Unfurleds, the Veils, the Florals and the Stripes or Pillars. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists' Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov, returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use Magna ‚Äì oil-based acrylic paints. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C., living there somewhat apart from the New York scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis's work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the look of a finished painting. Kenneth Noland, working in Washington, DC., was also a pioneer of the color field movement in the late 1950s who used series as important formats for his paintings. Some of Noland's major series were called Targets, Chevrons and Stripes. Noland attended the experimental Black Mountain College and studied art in his home state of North Carolina. Noland studied with professor Ilya Bolotowsky who introduced him to neo-plasticism and the work of Piet Mondrian. There he also studied Bauhaus theory and color with Josef AlbersBold Emblems\\".

In the early 1960s several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although they turned out to be profoundly different in the long run. Some of the new styles and movements that appeared in the early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: Washington Color School, Hard-edge painting, Geometric abstraction, Minimalism, and Color Field. Gene Davis also was a painter known especially for paintings of vertical stripes of color, like Black Grey Beat, 1964, and he also was a member of the group of abstract painters in Washington, D.C. during the 1960s known as the Washington Color School. The Washington painters were among the most prominent of the mid- century Color Field painters. Jack Bush, Big A, 1968.

The artists associated with the Color Field movement during the 1960s were moving away from gesture and angst in favor of clear surfaces and gestalt. During the early to mid-1960s Color Field painting was the term for the work of artists like Anne Truitt, John McLaughlin, Sam Francis, Sam Gilliam, Thomas Downing, Ellsworth Kelly, Paul Feeley, Friedel Dzubas, Jack Bush, Howard Mehring, Gene Davis, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Goodnough, Ray Parker, Al Held, Emerson Woelffer, David Simpson, and others whose works were formerly related to second generation abstract expressionism; and also to younger artists like Larry Poons, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, John Hoyland, Walter Darby Bannard and Frank Stella. All were moving in a new direction away from the violence and anxiety of Action painting toward a new and seemingly calmer language of color. Although Color Field is associated with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred to use the term Post-Painterly Abstraction. In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called post-painterly abstraction.\\"Clement Greenberg\\". Post-Painterly Abstraction.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a significant figure in the emergence of Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color Field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color Field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980. In the late 1960s Richard Diebenkorn began his Ocean Park series; created during the final 25 years of his career and they are important examples of color field painting. The Ocean Park series exemplified by Ocean Park No.129, connects his earlier abstract expressionist works with Color field painting. During the early 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn was known as an abstract expressionist, and his gestural abstractions were close to the New York School in sensibility but firmly based in the San Francisco abstract expressionist sensibility; a place where Clyfford Still has a considerable influence on younger artists by virtue of his teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute. By the mid-1950s, Richard Diebenkorn along with David Park, Elmer Bischoff and several others formed the Bay Area Figurative School with a return to Figurative painting. During the period between the fall 1964 and the spring of 1965 Diebenkorn traveled throughout Europe, he was granted a cultural visa to visit and view Henri Matisse paintings in important Soviet museums. He traveled to the then Soviet Union to study Henri Matisse paintings in Russian museums that were rarely seen outside of Russia. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965 his resulting works summed up all that he had learned from his more than a decade as a leading figurative painter.Livingston, Jane. \\"The Art of Richard Diebenkorn\\". 1997‚Äì1998 Exhibition catalog.

Among a new generation of abstract painters who emerged combining color field painting with expressionism, the older generation also began infusing new elements of complex space and surface into their works. By the 1970s Poons created thick-skinned, cracked and heavy paintings referred to as Elephant Skin paintings; while Christensen sprayed loops, colored webs of lines and calligraphy, across multi-colored fields of delicate grounds; Ronnie Landfield's stained band paintings are reflections of both Chinese landscape painting and the Color Field idiom, and John Seery's stained painting as exemplified by East, 1973, from the National Gallery of Australia.

Overview  Color Field painting is related to Post-painterly abstraction, Suprematism, Abstract Expressionism, Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction. It initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and several series of paintings by Joan Mir√≥. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. An important distinction that made color field painting different from abstract expression was the paint handling. The most basic fundamental defining technique of painting is application of paint and the color field painters revolutionized the way paint could be effectively applied. Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Adolph Gottlieb, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Friedel Dzubas, and Frank Stella, and others often used greatly reduced formats, with drawing essentially simplified to repetitive and regulated systems, basic references to nature, and a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated overt recognizable imagery in favor of abstraction. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, these artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image often within series' of related types. In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks and paint handling of Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, Color Field painting initially appeared to be cool and austere. Color field painters efface the individual mark in favor of large, flat, stained and soaked areas of color, considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction along with the actual shape of the canvas, which Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However, Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural Abstract expressionism. Denying connection to Abstract Expressionism or any other Art Movement Mark Rothko spoke clearly about his paintings in 1956: > I am not an abstractionist ... I am not interested in the relationship of > color or form or anything else. ... I'm interested only in expressing basic > human emotions ‚Äî tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on ‚Äî and the fact that a lot > of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures show that I > communicate those basic human emotions. ...

Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Mir√≥'s example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint. In 1970 artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining: > When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas > unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as > positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was > part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or > negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had > paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to > fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of > colors. It's saying it in space.De Antonio, Emile. Painters Painting, a > Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940‚Äì1970, P.82, Abbeville Press > 1984, = Spray painting = Surprisingly few artists used the spray gun technique to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, who was a pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi- colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s. = Stripes = Stripes were one of the most popular vehicles for color used by several different Color Field painters in a variety of different formats. Barnett Newman, Morris Louis, Jack Bush, Gene Davis, Kenneth Noland and David Simpson, all made important Series' of stripe paintings. Although he did not call them stripes but zips Barnett Newman's stripes were mostly vertical, of varying widths and sparingly used. In Simpson and Noland's case their stripe paintings were all mostly horizontal, while Gene Davis painted vertical stripe paintings and Morris Louis mostly painted vertical stripe paintings sometimes called Pillars. Jack Bush tended to do both horizontal and vertical stripe paintings as well as angular ones. = Magna paint = Magna, a special artist use acrylic paint was developed by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement.Henry, Walter. palimpsest.stanford.edu - Technical Exchange .

Acrylics were first made commercially available in the 1950s as mineral spirit-based paints called MagnaTerry Fenton online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint, accessed April 30th, 2007 offered by Leonard Bocour. Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as \\"latex\\" house paints, although acrylic dispersion uses no latex derived from a rubber tree. Interior \\"latex\\" house paints tend to be a combination of binder (sometimes acrylic, vinyl, pva and others), filler, pigment and water. Exterior \\"latex\\" house paints may also be a \\"co-polymer\\" blend, but the very best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic. Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, both artists ‚Äì the first of whom were Mexican muralists ‚Äì and companies began to explore the potential of the new binders. Acrylic artist paints can be thinned with water and used as washes in the manner of watercolor paints, although the washes are fast and permanent once dry. Water-soluble artist-quality acrylic paints became commercially available in the early 1960s, offered by Liquitex and Bocour under the trade name of Aquatec. Water-soluble Liquitex and Aquatec proved to be ideally suited for stain painting. The staining technique with water-soluble acrylics made diluted colors sink and hold fast into raw canvas. Painters such as Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Sam Francis, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Larry Poons, Jules Olitski, Gene Davis, Ronald Davis, Sam Gilliam and others successfully used water-based acrylics for their new stain, color field paintings.Junker, Howard.

The Ocean Park series connects his earlier abstract expressionist works with Color field painting. The influence of both Henri Matisse and Joan Mir√≥ is particularly strong in this painting. Henri Matisse, View of Notre Dame, 1914, Museum of Modern Art. The Henri Matisse paintings French Window at Collioure, and View of Notre DameView of Notre Dame, 1914 at MoMA, retrieved December 18, 2008 both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general (including Robert Motherwell's Open Series) and on Richard Diebenkorn's Ocean Park paintings specifically. The painterly legacy of 20th-century painting is a long and intertwined mainstream of influences and complex interrelationships. The use of large opened fields of expressive color applied in generous painterly portions, accompanied by loose drawing (vague linear spots and/or figurative outline) can first be seen in the early 20th-century works of both Henri Matisse and Joan Mir√≥. Matisse and Mir√≥, as well as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and Piet Mondrian directly influenced the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters of Post-Painterly Abstraction and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Late 19th-century Americans like Augustus Vincent Tack and Albert Pinkham Ryder, along with early American Modernists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, and Milton Avery's landscapes also provided important precedents and were influences on the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters, and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Henri Matisse paintings French Window at Collioure, and View of Notre Dame both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general, (including Robert Motherwell's Open Series), and on Richard Diebenkorn's Ocean Park paintings specifically. According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966, and they had an enormous impact on him and his work.Livingston, Jane. \\"The Art of Richard Diebenkorn\\". In: 1997-1998 Exhibition catalog, Whitney Museum of American Art. 62-67. Jane Livingston says about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles: > It is difficult not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the > direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there > reverberate in almost every Ocean Park canvas. View of Notre Dame and French > Window at Collioure, both painted in 1914, were on view for the first time > in the US. Livingston goes on to say Diebenkorn must have experienced French Window at Collioure, as an epiphany.Livingston, Jane. The Art of Richard Diebenkorn. In 1997-1998 Exhibition catalog, Whitney Museum of American Art. 64. , Joan Mir√≥ was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Mir√≥ pioneered the technique of staining; creating blurry, multi-colored cloudy backgrounds in thinned oil paint throughout the 1920s and 1930s; on top of which he added his calligraphy, characters and abundant lexicon of words, and imagery. Arshile Gorky openly admired Mir√≥'s work and painted Mir√≥-like Gorky paintings, before finally discovering his own originality in the early 1940s. During the 1960s Mir√≥ painted large (abstract expressionist scale) radiant fields of vigorously brushed paint in blue, in white, and other monochromatic fields of colors; with blurry black orbs and calligraphic stone-like shapes, floating at random. These works resembled the Color Field paintings of the younger generation. Biographer Jacques Dupin said this about Mir√≥'s work of the early 1960s: > These canvases disclose affinities ‚Äì Mir√≥ does not in the least attempt to > deny this ‚Äì with the researches of a new generation of painters. Many of > these, Jackson Pollock for one, have acknowledged their debt to Mir√≥. Mir√≥ > in turn displays lively interest in their work and never misses an > opportunity to encourage and support them. Nor does he consider it beneath > his dignity to use their discoveries on some occasions.Dupin, Jacques. Joan > Mir√≥ Life and Work. New York City: Harry N. Abrams, 1962. 481 Taking its example from other European modernists like Joan Mir√≥, the Color Field movement encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century through the early 21st century. Color Field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms to refer to the three separate but related groups are Abstract expressionism, Post- Painterly Abstraction, and Lyrical Abstraction. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color Field pioneers such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and Robert Motherwell are primarily thought of as Abstract Expressionists. Artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jules Olitski, and Kenneth Noland were of a slightly younger generation, or in the case of Morris Louis esthetically aligned with that generation's point of view; that started out as Abstract Expressionists but quickly moved to Post-Painterly Abstraction. While younger artists like Frank Stella, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Ronnie Landfield, Dan Christensen, began with Post-Painterly Abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as Lyrical Abstraction. Many of the artists mentioned, as well as many others, have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of Color Field painting; as reflections of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s (in which everything began to hang loose) and the angst of the age (with all of the uncertainties of the time) merged with the gestalt of Post-Painterly Abstraction, producing Lyrical Abstraction which combined precision of the Color Field idiom with the malerische of the Abstract Expressionists. During the same period of the late 1960s, and early 1970s in Europe, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer\\"White Cube: Anselm Kiefer\\". White Cube. Retrieved December 15, 2008. and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery, and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as Neo-expressionism.

The line commences at Roma St station, travelling through the city and extends through Brisbane's northern suburbs to Caboolture, which the line continues north to Sunshine Coast and connects with the Ipswich line south-west of Brisbane. The line distance from Brisbane Central is 49.6 km. Lines that branch from it are the Ferny Grove line at Bowen Hills, the Doomben and Airport lines at Eagle Junction, the Shorncliffe line at Northgate and the Redcliffe Peninsula line at Petrie. History Petrie railway station, 2012 The first section of the line, to Northgate (and onto Sandgate) opened in 1882. In 1883 the Queensland government decided to link Gladstone to Brisbane by railway, and eventually decided upon Northgate as the junction for the new line.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong publications 1990 The alignment from Roma St to Bowen Hills was via Normanby (today known as the Exhibition line), and this remained the case until the dual track line via Central opened in 1890. The Queensland Government called tenders for construction of the new line in 1886, with the contractor undertaking works \\"energetically\\",Kerr, J. 'Brunswick St, Bowen Hills & Beyond' ARHS 1988 and despite delays due to the late arrival of bridge beams, the line was unofficially opened on 11 June 1888, with the official opening on 16 June 1888.The coming of the Queensland Railways J.

The section from Bowen Hills to Eagle Junction was duplicated in 1886, with the section to Northgate duplicated in 1890, and on to Caboolture by 1917. The section from Roma St to Bowen Hills was electrified in 1979, to Northgate in 1982, to Petrie in 1983 and to Caboolture in 1986. The growth in patronage as a result of electrification resulted in the quadruplication of the Roma St-Northgate section in 1996, including 2 pairs of single track tunnels and the realisation of the use of the Bowen Hills tunnel widened 20 years earlier. Some of the roadbed and bridge abutments had been built in the 1950s before the original quadruplication scheme was abandoned. A third line has been added as far as Lawnton, which has been extended to Petrie as part of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, which opened on 4 October 2016. Following the opening of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, a decision was made that all services on the Caboolture line would run express between Petrie and Bowen Hills, stopping only at Northgate and Eagle Junction. Stations between Petrie and Northgate would be serviced by the new Redcliffe Peninsula services while stations between Northgate and Bowen Hills would continue to be serviced by other existing services. Line guide and services All trains run express between Petrie and Bowen Hills, stopping only at Northgate and Eagle Junction.

Torah ark (or Aron Kodesh) refers to an ornamental chamber in the synagogue that houses the Torah scrolls.Wischnitzer, Rachel, and Bezalel Narkiss (2007). \\"Ark.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. p. 463-464. Available online via Jewish Virtual Library; retrieved 2019-05-20. History Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue in Old Jerusalem. The building was originally constructed in the 17th century. The ark, also known as the ark of law, or in Hebrew the Aron Kodesh or aron ha-Kodesh (\\"holy ark\\") by Ashkenazi communities and as the Heikhal (\\"sanctuary\\") among Sefardi communities. Aron Kodesh comes from Hebrew ◊ê÷∏◊®◊ï÷π◊ü ◊ß◊Ñ◊ì÷∂◊©  ºƒÅr≈çn q≈çde≈° (i.e. Aron Kodesh), Holy Ark. This name is a reference to the ‚ÄôƒÅr≈çn haqq≈çde≈°, the Hebrew name for the Ark of the Covenant which was stored in the Holy of Holies in the inner sanctuary of both the ancient Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem. Similarly, Hekh√°l, also written hechal, echal or heichal ‚Äî and sometimes also Echal Kodesh (mainly among Balkan Sephardim) comes from Hebrew ◊î÷µ◊ô◊õ÷∏◊ú hƒìkhƒÅl (palace), was used in the same time period to refer to the inner sanctuary. The hekhal contained the Menorah, Altar of Incense, and Table of the Showbread. Ark customs and location In some ancient synagogues, such as the fifth-century synagogue in Susya, the Torah scroll was not placed inside the synagogue at all, but in a room adjacent to it, signifying that the sacredness of the synagogue does not come from the ark but from its being a house of prayer. The Torah was brought into the synagogue for reading purposes. In synagogues outside of Jerusalem, the ark is placed in a chamber that is in a recess in the wall, facing Jerusalem, and worshipers face this direction when reciting prayers of the service such as the Amidah. The ark is often closed with a parochet (\\"curtain\\") placed either outside the doors of the Holy Ark (Ashkenazi and Mizrachi custom) or inside the doors of the ark (Spanish and Portuguese and Moroccan or Sephardic custom). The parochet is an ornate cloth that resembles the same cloth that was once on the golden Ark. Both the aron kodesh and parochet are usually inscribed with verses from Judaic holy scripture. These inscriptions generally display the purity of the synagogue or the celebrated uniqueness of the scrolls placed within. Jewish law states the ark is the second holiest part of a synagogue after the Torah scrolls themselves. Customs call for the congregation when reciting key prayers (such as Avinu Malkeinu ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur Father Our King‚Äù ), to stand and face the ark, on fasting days, the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur (also called the High Holidays), and for many piyyutim (poems, songs, etc.) recited during High Holy Day services. Many who partake in these customs consider it respectful to stand as long as the ark is open and the Torah is being moved to the reading table (or podium). However, there is no actual obligation (law) to remain standing when the ark is open, but it is a universally accepted custom. In addition to this custom is the custom to never turn ones back towards the ark even when leaving the sanctuary. Instead one must back out until you have left the vicinity of the ark and only then can you turn your back (by the Kotel which is considered as a synagogue itself, this custom also exists).  Evolution of the modern ark  Originally, the scrolls were placed in moveable containers that were risen up. The more permanent placement of the ark was designed as the tribes settled and built temples. As early as 245 C.E. in the synagogue of Dura-Europos a slit within the holy wall (or wall facing Jerusalem) was created for the ark. In ancient times, the cloth wrapped scrolls are believed to have been placed flat within a low wooden box. Historical records or discoveries point to a variety of exterior designs becoming popular within the Jewish culture of the time. Archeologists found early Torah arks within the Jewish catacombs in Rome decorated with Pompeian frescoes, paintings, and graffiti. Throughout Europe, in the Middle Ages, designs favored taller arks. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Spanish and German Jewish Hebrew texts depict a new design. These texts placed the scrolls inside the ark standing upright, decorated, and wrapped with the appropriate cloth and covers. A Sephardic synagogue based in Amsterdam (c.1675) contains a baroque style ark, which takes up the entire width of the central hub of the building. The Sephardic synagogue based as far north as London (c. 1701) adopted the design as mainstream. In this period, most synagogues in Europe were designed with the reading table (or podium) in the center of the building. The ark was placed on the Eastern wall, so the congregation would be facing Jerusalem when praying. During the 18th century, German synagogues incorporated a baroque style design. Decorative features such as pilasters, columns, and vases became a standard practice. Wood and stone carvers in Eastern Europe began to employ unique local craft designs in synagogue architecture. Folk art and animals were popular designs features added to the ark during this period. Early designs in the United States featured built-in ark‚Äôs in synagogues. Examples such as the 1763 Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island. That was inspired by a trend of grandeur in architectural design. The United States Jewish community continued to favor the grand or classical design style until around 1840. In the mid-1800s the Moorish style synagogues influenced by the Oriental style became the latest fashion in synagogue design. The Oriental ark design included sliding doors and a curved forepart. The most notable features of this era included domes and arches that contained geometrical polychrome designs. Many synagogue styles from the 16th to the 19th century can be seen across American and throughout Europe. However, after World War II, the ark design evolved into an art form. New experimental forms and materials were employed in the making of modern arks based on the unique interests of the community commissioning the ark.

Now, nine expressways link Beijing, and future expressways are planned. History When the Airport Expressway and the Jingjintang Expressway opened, Beijing was already being gripped by \\"expressway fever\\". Out in the far eastern part of town lay an unpopular Jingha Expressway; only with the construction of the Jingtong Expressway in the mid-1990s did the Jingha Expressway get more recognition. It still is too far out of central Beijing to be recognised as an important express roadway. By the People's Republic of China's 50th anniversary, however, more expressways were being built in Beijing. The Badaling Expressway, Jingshen Expressway and (in 2000) the Jingkai Expressway were built. Beijing now had eight expressways. In 2001 the Jingcheng Expressway was built. The northeastern and southeastern parts are ready to accommodate two more expressways (the Jingping/Jingji and Northern Jingji Expressways, respectively). Development In 2004, the municipal government made a plan public complete up to of expressways ( in 2006). By 2006, the 6th Ring Road would be completed. Also in that year, a major batch of expressways would be completed. The expressways around Beijing total 15 (Jingping/Jingji, Northern Jingjin, Southern Jingjin, 2nd Airport Expressway, Northern Airport Expressway and Litian Expressway, plus the nine expressways of today). Of these, 11 would radiate from central Beijing. =Future plans= In early January 2005, mainland authorities revealed a plan for seven national expressways originating from Beijing. Amongst those included an expressway bound straight for Taiwan. The expressways include: * Beijing - Shanghai (Jinghu Expressway) * Beijing - Taipei * Beijing - Kunming * Beijing - Hong Kong/Macau * Beijing - Lhasa * Beijing - Urumqi * Beijing - Harbin After the \\"Three Links\\" come into effect, the projected of mainland expressways will have a link, possibly by tunnel, to Taiwan and all expressways on the island.

However, tolls are networked with the 6th Ring Road. Extended expressways The nine expressways also indirectly become portions of other expressways. The Badaling Expressway connects after Yanqing to Zhangjiakou as the Jingzhang Expressway. Already as of Madian, it forms part of the Jingda Expressway. The Jinghu Expressway becomes an independent expressway after Tianjin. The Jingshi Expressway forms part of the Jingzhu Expressway. Alternate names The Badaling Expressway is sometimes referred to as the Jingchang Expressway, as the first stage of the expressway runs through Changping District. Projected expressways =Jingping Expressway= Current Status: Not yet constructed; in planning Beijing's Pinggu District so far is the only district without an expressway link. However, Beijing will soon build the Jingping Expressway to link to Pinggu. This expressway will also link to Ji County in Tianjin, which would also link to the Jinji Expressway, ultimately connecting Tianjin City. Thus, this road is also known as the projected Jingji Expressway. The expressway would start at Yaojiayuan Bridge on Beijing's 5th Ring Road and stretch for 69 kilometres. It would ultimately be connected to the eastern [4th Ring Road]. A tunnel is planned. The expressway would presumably be constructed in 2005, with a section opening in early 2006, and completion scheduled by early 2007. =Jingkai Expressway= Current Status: Jingkai Expressway from Yuquanying to Yufa open to traffic In 2004, an additional 7 kilometres of the Jingkai Expressway was announced. Although specific details are not currently clear, it may be the extension from Yufa into Gu'an in Hebei province, which currently is part of China National Highway 106, but which many maps claim now to be already expressway. =Airport Expressway= Current Status: Airport Expressway open to traffic Two further routes, both of them being expressways, will link Beijing Capital International Airport. The Airport Northern Route from the Jingcheng Expressway will stretch to the airport. A second airport expressway will stretch . This second airport expressway would run between the eastern 5th Ring Road and the eastern 6th Ring Road, starting up north from the airport and leading through to the second Jingjin Expressway (bound for Tianjin). =Jingjintang Expressway= Current Status: Jingjintang Expressway open to traffic The current Jingjintang Expressway is open to traffic but congested. This means that when traffic accidents occur, rescue efforts can be delayed. Thus, both Beijing and Tianjin have approved the construction of two more expressways to Tianjin to ease congestion. The northern route shall leave Beijing at Tongzhou District and pass through Yangcun in Tianjin. A southern route shall also exist. Both routes will stretch 35 kilometres each (at least in the Beijing sections). =Jingbao Expressway= Announced only in 2004, the Jingbao Expressway go for 25.9 kilometres in length in the Beijing area, reducing traffic load on the Badaling Expressway. The project's route must avoid disturbing the Ming Tombs.

Operated as a spin-off of the magazine of the same name, the network airs a variety of programming focusing on the cottage and rural lifestyle genre within the core themes of DIY and design, food and entertaining, real estate, and outdoor living. The network originally launched in 2001 as Country Canada, which primarily focused on programming of interest to rural Canadians, including news and lifestyle programming. After the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought out Corus Entertainment's stake in Country Canada, the network began to transition towards marketing itself as a companion to CBC Television, reduced the amount of rural-themed programming it aired in favour of entertainment programs and CBC Sports overflow, and eventually re-branded itself as Bold in 2008. In the midst of budget cuts at the CBC, Bold was sold to its current owners, Blue Ant Media, in April 2012; on September 4, 2013, Bold was re-launched by Blue Ant Media as Cottage Life. History Channel logo under the name Country Canada (2001-2002) In November 2000, a joint venture between Corus Entertainment (70%) and the CBC (30%) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a channel called Land and Sea, presumably the name taken from the CBC original series Land and Sea. The newly licensed channel was described as \\"a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service for rural Canadian families, with a focus on adults 25-54.

The channel held true to its CRTC- mandated nature of service by focusing on rural news, information, lifestyle, and entertainment programming suitable for the whole family. Such programs that were broadcast on the channel included CountryLine, a call-in talk show discussing various topics of interest to rural Canadians; CBC News: CountryWide, a national news program with both a morning and evening edition focusing on national news stories; Northern Exposure; All Creatures Great and Small; and the television rendition of Harrowsmith Country Life.Country Canada schedule Internet Archive retrieved 2013-03-30 Logo used as CBC Country Canada (2002-2008) In July 2002, CBC announced it would purchase Corus' interest in the service,CBC buys 100% of digi-net Country Canada Mediacaster Magazine 2002-07-26 which was approved by the CRTC on October 24 of that year.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-336 CRTC 2002-10-24 The CBC took control of the service on November 1, 2002 and rebranded the service with a new logo and name, CBC Country Canada. Logo used under the name Bold (2008-2013) After the change in ownership, the CBC initially relied heavily on CBC Television programming to fill the channel's schedule, with a particular focus on news programs. This transition was the first step in the channel moving away from its mandate to focus solely on rural programming, instead, shifting towards a focus on general interest Canadian programming. New programming added to the schedule included all 14 30-minute regional editions of Canada Now, Venture, CBC News: Politics, amateur sports programming from CBC Sports, CBC News: Saturday Report, and Cross Country Checkup.CBC Country Canada schedule Internet Archive retrieved 2013-03-30 After the initial change in programming after the rebranding, news, although still present on the channel, became less significant as the channel began to air more lifestyle, entertainment, and documentary programming such as Food Chain, an original program discussing various aspects of food; Greatdocs.ca, a series of various Canadian-made documentaries; Johnny Canuck Cinema, a series of various Canadian films; An American in Canada; and London's Burning.CBC Country Canada schedule Internet Archive retrieved 2013-03-30 Eventually, beginning in 2005, with the change in programming to focus more on general Canadian programming rather than solely rural-programming, the channel began to continuously promoted itself and its programs as a channel, according to its website, dedicated to \\"celebrating Canada, its land, people, regions and passions\\".Internet Archive of CBC Country Canada's website Dated 2004-06-19 Retrieved 2011-12-04 This shift included an increase in dramatic television series from Canada and Britain that had little to no relation to the rural lifestyle, and an increase in amateur sports coverage including alpine skiing, curling, snowboarding, Toronto FC, and Canada national team soccer, among others. In further continuation with this shift, in early 2007, CBC Country Canada began to no longer promote itself as a rural lifestyle service, rather as a secondary general entertainment service to the CBC, touting, according to its website \\"the new home of exclusive dramas and world championship sports, from home and around the world.

In time for its companion coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a high-definition feed launched on June 3, 2010.CBC Bold going HD for World Cup, CBC, 2010-06-02 =Nature of service dispute= Prior to rebranding the service as bold, the CBC informed the CRTC in October 2007 of its intentions and new programming directive for the service.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-214 CRTC 2010-04-14 Following this correspondence, the CBC and the CRTC exchanged correspondence back and forth in an effort to clarify how the change in programming for bold met the nature of service bold was intended to meet when it was originally licensed in 2000. The CRTC ultimately was not satisfied with the CBC's argument and called a public hearing into the matter in June 2009.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009-132 CRTC 2009-03-11 Prior to the hearing, the CBC contacted the CRTC to inform them that they did not contest the CRTC's view that the service did not meet the requirements of its nature of service and informed the CRTC that it would like to file an application to modify Bold's nature of service to state it is \\"a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service for rural Canadians. The service will provide information, interaction and entertainment.\\" During the separate hearing for the application to modify Bold's nature of service at a later date, the CRTC examined the request and found several issues with the change in nature of service, primarily being that it would allow the service to morph into a general interest service instead of a niche service for rural Canadians, since it would not require the channel to be from \\"a rural perspective\\", implying a service defined as \\"for rural Canadians\\" would be too broad in nature. Subsequently, the CRTC denied its application and required the CBC to inform the CRTC within 30 days of a new programming proposal to ensure its meets the channel's nature of service. In response to this decision, the CBC filed yet another application to amend Bold's nature of service, this time reading as \\"a national English-language Category A specialty television service with a focus on adults 25-54. The service will provide information, interaction and entertainment programming dedicated to reflecting Canada's various regions, including Canada's rural and non-urban regions, to national and regional audiences. The mandate of the service will be to reflect in its programming the unique tapestry of Canada's regions, including programming that reflects the living realities of rural Canadians.\\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-286 CRTC 2011-05-03 Within this application, the CBC also requested to define rural Canadians using Statistics Canada definition, reading as \\"individuals from rural non-metro adjacent areas, rural metro adjacent areas and rural northern areas.\\" Although the CRTC raised some concerns over the proposed schedule the CBC submitted as part of this application, the CRTC ultimately approved the application and was satisfied with the changes, stating that the new definition of rural Canadians was more appropriate since it reflected their geographical location, rather than their occupations as the previous nature of service defined; and to ensure the programming reflected Canada's various regions, as per the new nature of service, the CRTC added a definition of such programming. =Blue Ant Media purchase= On April 4, 2012, the CBC announced, in the wake of a $115 million government funding budget cut to be phased in over the next 3 years,CBC sees government funding slashed by $115-million The Globe and Mail 2012-03-29 that it would sell Bold as a measure to cope with the budget shortfallCBC says it will cut 650 jobs Canoe.ca 2012-04-04 since the service's licence conditions no longer fit the CBC's strategy nor complement the other programming streams.

He received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States in 1933. Early life Cunningham was born in Atlanta, Kansas and grew up in Elkhart, Kansas. When he was eight years old, his legs were very badly burned in an explosion caused by someone accidentally putting gasoline instead of kerosene in the can at his schoolhouse. His brother Floyd, 13, died in the fire. When the doctors recommended amputating Glenn's legs, he was so distressed his parents would not allow it. The doctors predicted he might never walk normally again. He had lost all the flesh on his knees and shins and all the toes on his left foot. Also, his transverse arch was practically destroyed. However, his great determination, coupled with hours upon hours of a new type of therapy, enabled him to gradually regain the ability to walk and to proceed to run.Interview with Glenn Cunningham. MyBestYears.com It was in the early summer of 1919 when he first tried to walk again, roughly two years after the accident. He had a positive attitude as well as a strong religious faith. His favorite Bible verse was Isaiah 40:31: \\"But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\\" Accomplishments Cunningham competing for Kansas University Cunningham competed in the 1500 m event at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics and finished fourth and second, respectively. While on the ship, traveling from the U.S. to Germany in 1936, he was voted \\"Most Popular Athlete\\" by his fellow Olympians. Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 1933 for his achievements in middle-distance running. In 1934, he set the world record for the mile run at 4:06.8, which stood for three years. He also set world records in the 800 m in 1936 and in the indoor mile in 1938. Cunningham's unachieved goal was a four-minute mile, a goal attempted and unmet by many other runners. Several theorists proclaimed it was impossible physiologically for humans. Some athletes tried running steady and fast-paced the whole time. Others tried to go steady for the first half then give it all they had. Glenn worried about the strength of his legs burned in his youth, so he started slow ‚Äì running in the pack. He would be fresher in the second half ‚Äì and would almost be sprinting the last 100 yards to the finish. Cunningham has a park named after him in his hometown of Elkhart, Kansas. The mile run at the Kansas Relays is named in his honor. In 1974 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Retirement Cunningham earned a master's degree from the University of Iowa and a PhD from New York University. After retiring from competitions in 1940 he served as director of physical education at Cornell College in Iowa for four years. Later he opened the Glenn Cunningham Youth Ranch in Kansas, where he and his wife helped 10,000 needy and abused children. References External links *American Miler, Paul J.

Unlike NMR, NQR transitions of nuclei can be detected in the absence of a magnetic field, and for this reason NQR spectroscopy is referred to as \\"zero Field NMR.\\" The NQR resonance is mediated by the interaction of the electric field gradient (EFG) with the quadrupole moment of the nuclear charge distribution. Unlike NMR, NQR is applicable only to solids and not liquids, because in liquids the quadrupole moment averages out. Because the EFG at the location of a nucleus in a given substance is determined primarily by the valence electrons involved in the particular bond with other nearby nuclei, the NQR frequency at which transitions occur is unique for a given substance. A particular NQR frequency in a compound or crystal is proportional to the product of the nuclear quadrupole moment, a property of the nucleus, and the EFG in the neighborhood of the nucleus. It is this product which is termed the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant for a given isotope in a material and can be found in tables of known NQR transitions. In NMR, an analogous but not identical phenomenon is the coupling constant, which is also the result of an internuclear interaction between nuclei in the analyte. Principle Any nucleus with more than one unpaired nuclear particle (protons or neutrons) will have a charge distribution which results in an electric quadrupole moment. Allowed nuclear energy levels are shifted unequally due to the interaction of the nuclear charge with an electric field gradient supplied by the non-uniform distribution of electron density (e.g. from bonding electrons) and/or surrounding ions. As in the case of NMR, irradiation of the nucleus with a burst of RF electromagnetic radiation may result in absorption of some energy by the nucleus which can be viewed as a perturbation of the quadrupole energy level. Unlike the NMR case, NQR absorption takes place in the absence of an external magnetic field. Application of an external static field to a quadrupolar nucleus splits the quadrupole levels by the energy predicted from the Zeeman interaction. The technique is very sensitive to the nature and symmetry of the bonding around the nucleus. It can characterize phase transitions in solids when performed at varying temperature. Due to symmetry, the shifts become averaged to zero in the liquid phase, so NQR spectra can only be measured for solids. =Analogy with NMR= In the case of NMR, nuclei with spin ‚â• 1/2 have a magnetic dipole moment so that their energies are split by a magnetic field, allowing resonance absorption of energy related to the Larmor frequency: \\\\omega_L = \\\\gamma B where \\\\gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the (normally applied) magnetic field external to the nucleus. In the case of NQR, nuclei with spin ‚â• 1, such as 14N, 17O, 35Cl and 63Cu, also have an electric quadrupole moment. The nuclear quadrupole moment is associated with non-spherical nuclear charge distributions. As such it is a measure of the degree to which the nuclear charge distribution deviates from that of a sphere; that is, the prolate or oblate shape of the nucleus. NQR is a direct observation of the interaction of the quadrupole moment with the local electric field gradient (EFG) created by the electronic structure of its environment. The NQR transition frequencies are proportional to the product of the electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus and a measure of the strength of the local EFG: \\\\omega_Q \\\\sim \\\\frac{e^2 Q q}{\\\\hbar} = C_q where q is related to the largest principal component of the EFG tensor at the nucleus. C_q is referred to as the quadrupole coupling constant. In principle, the NQR experimenter could apply a specified EFG in order to influence \\\\omega_Q just as the NMR experimenter is free to choose the Larmor frequency by adjusting the magnetic field. However, in solids, the strength of the EFG is many kV/m^2, making the application of EFG's for NQR in the manner that external magnetic fields are chosen for NMR impractical. Consequently, the NQR spectrum of a substance is specific to the substance - and NQR spectrum is a so called \\"chemical fingerprint.\\" Because NQR frequencies are not chosen by the experimenter, they can be difficult to find making NQR a technically difficult technique to carry out. Since NQR is done in an environment without a static (or DC) magnetic field, it is sometimes called \\"zero field NMR\\". Many NQR transition frequencies depend strongly upon temperature. Applications There are several research groups around the world currently working on ways to use NQR to detect explosives. Units designed to detect landminesAppendix K: Nuclear quadrupole resonance, by Allen N. Garroway, Naval Research Laboratory. In Jacqueline MacDonald, J. R. Lockwood: Alternatives for Landmine Detection. Report MR-1608, Rand Corporation, 2003. and explosives concealed in luggage have been tested. A detection system consists of a radio frequency (RF) power source, a coil to produce the magnetic excitation field and a detector circuit which monitors for a RF NQR response coming from the explosive component of the object. A fake device known as the ADE 651 claimed to exploit NQR to detect explosives but in fact could do no such thing. Nonetheless, the device was successfully sold for millions to dozens of countries, including the government of Iraq. Another practical use for NQR is measuring the water/gas/oil coming out of an oil well in realtime. This particular technique allows local or remote monitoring of the extraction process, calculation of the well's remaining capacity and the water/detergents ratio the input pump must send to efficiently extract oil. Due to the strong temperature dependence of the NQR frequency, it can be used as a precise temperature sensor with resolution on the order of 10‚àí4 ¬∞C.

The main track, in length, runs between the Obelisk in Macquarie Place in Sydney to Queens Wharf in Bicentennial Park in Newcastle and is well sign-posted. There are many \\"side tracks\\" which link the track to populated areas along the length of the walk. The walk includes a huge variety of wildlife and scenery. A section at the northern, Newcastle end, is also known as the Yuelarbah Track. This section runs from the Teralba railway station to the Queens Wharf on Newcastle Harbour. At Kahibah Station, the Great North Walk uses a short section of The Fernleigh Track and passes along the northern side of Glenrock Lagoon to get to the coast.  History  The Great North Walk was initiated by Gary McDougall and Leigh Shearer-Heriot. They both planned and marked the original route from Sydney to Newcastle, with access to many linking tracks. Today's Great North Walk is quite true to the original trail. There have been books written about the walk.'The Great North Walk Companion' A. Henderson-Sellers et al., 2009 The original name for the Great North Walk was the 'Sydney to Hunter Project'. The name 'the Great North Walk' was derived from the first road from the Hunter Valley to Sydney, called the 'Great North Road'. The track began construction in 1987 and was completed less than a year later in early 1988, in time for the Australian Bicentennial celebrations. Workers from several countries including China, Thailand and Vietnam were hired by the NSW State Government to complete the track by 1988. A small amount of local controversy followed as the labourers won the contract to construct the track over a local landscaping and environmental business. Claim was made that the contract was only won because it cost as much as three times less than the local bid.An analysis of occupational outcomes for Indigenous and Asian employees in Australia V.K. Borooah & J. Mangan, Economic record, 2002. The company, Ning-Pow Australia, who were responsible for providing the labourers for the project, were heavily scrutinised for slow construction and poor treatment of their workers. The track was eventually finished but was of poor quality. Following the bicentennial year, the NSW State Government handed over maintenance responsibility to each sections respective land owners, mainly NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and State Forests. Under new responsibility, the track was upgraded to a higher quality. In several places the track had to be re-constructed taking completely different routes, because the original had been so terribly built. Eventually, the track was completed to a good standard and remains well maintained in most places.Australia and Asian capitalism A. David & E.L. Wheelwright, 1989. Description After its official start in Macquarie Place, the walk continues through the suburb of Hunters Hill, where there are many heritage homes, then arrives at the Lane Cove River.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.8‚Äì19 It follows the river through the Lane Cove National Park to Thornleigh, then follows Berowra Creek. Further north, the track crosses over to the Ku-ring-gai Chase National ParkSydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, pp.74‚Äì76 before proceeding to Brooklyn, on the Hawkesbury River. The river can be crossed either by train or boat, after which the track proceeds north through Brisbane Water National ParkThe Great North Walk, McDougall, Shearer-Heriot (Kangaroo Press) 1988, pp.96‚Äì100 and the Ourimbah ValleyThe Great North Walk, pp.117‚Äì119 before reaching the Watagan State Forest.The Great North Walk, pp.114‚Äì136 Further north, the track veers east in the vicinity of Brunkerville and follows the Myall Range for some distance before reaching Teralba, on the southern fringes of Newcastle. It then proceeds to its official finishing point in Newcastle. In addition to the main track between Sydney and Newcastle, there is an extension that goes north to the Hunter Region. The extension departs from the main track in the vicinity of Brunkerville, and proceeds along a country road to the village of Paxton, passing abandoned coal mines along the way. From Paxton it proceeds north and follows the Mount View Range, where there are extensive views in the direction of Cessnock. The track then descends the northern end of the range before terminating in the wine-making area of Pokolbin. The total walk from Sydney to Newcastle takes between 8 and 14 days to complete, with popular camp sites at designated spots along the way. Many of these sites are on ridge tops with no available water supply. Where natural standing water is available, it is not necessarily safe to drink and should be treated before use. It is not necessary to do the walk in one go; individual sections can be completed easily as day walks. The track is often close to the railway line, providing convenient rail access at a number of points. Some early sections in Sydney are through local suburbs on sealed roads. There are more than a dozen ancient Aboriginal rock art sites along the route.http://www.thegreatnorthwalk.com/rockart The best time to take this walk is late autumn, winter and spring. Summer is extremely hot and should be avoided, particularly if bushfire risk is high.  Terrain profile  The terrain profile of the Great North Walk as of the end of 2010.

For most of its history, BC Tel served as one of several regional monopolies in Canada. In 1985 the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ruled to once again allow competition in long-distance telephone service.Winsek, D. Telecommunications. The Canadian Encyclopedia, Historica Dominion. Retrieved on: 2012-01-23. In 1998, BC Tel merged with Telus to become the second largest telecommunications company in Canada. History In 1904 the Victoria & Esquimalt Telephone Company and the New Westminster & Burrard Inlet Telephone Company were taken over by The Vernon & Nelson Telephone Company. On July 5, 1904, the name of the company was changed to the British Columbia Telephone Company Limited. In 1916 the British Columbia Telephone Company Limited obtained a Federal charter and dropped the word Limited from its name. Theodore Gary & Company bought a substantial interest in BC Telephone in December 1926 held in Canada under the Anglo-Canadian Telephone Company. Other Gary Companies at the time included International Automatic Telephone Company & British Insulated Cables. Mr G H Halse remained as President & General Manager of BC Telephone. BC Telephone participated in Canada's first coast to coast radio broadcast for Canada's Diamond Jubilee, July 1, 1927. On the 1 April 1929, a charter was obtained for a new company under BC Telephone to be called \\"North-West Telephone Company\\". This company was created to experiment with Radio-Telephony as a method to serve areas of the province otherwise unreachable by wire. The first experiment was in providing a connection to Powell River from Campbell River, 50 miles across the water. A new record for storm damage in the BC Telephone system was set little over a year after the previous record had been set. The rain and sleet began early in the morning of Monday January 21, 1935. There were 1500 poles and 700 miles of wire down in the Fraser valley. Victoria had 1800 telephones out of service. The trans Canada toll line was not back in service until 10 February 1935. The first photographs ever to be transmitted from Vancouver via wire photo service took place during the royal visit of 29 May 1939. GTE of Stamford, Connecticut, became a 50.2% owner of the BC Telephone Company when the Theodore Gary Company merged with GTE in 1955. The \\"North-West Telephone Company\\" was officially merged into the BC Telephone Company on 1 January 1961. In 1979 the BC Telephone Company acquired Automatic Electric Canada and formed \\"AEL Microtel\\". Soon afterwards the name was shortened to \\"Microtel\\". In 1982 \\"BTE - Business Terminal Equipment\\" was formed to compete in the newly deregulated premises equipment field. BC Telephone formed \\"BC Cellular\\" in 1985 to compete in the new cellular telephone business. On 1 May 1993 BC Telephone reorganised under holding company \\"BC Telecom Inc\\" and changed its legal operating name to \\"BC Tel\\". Merger with TELUS The deregulation of the phone industry in the 1990s combined with the competition of copper lines with cell phones, totally changed the business environment. In a 1999 \\"merger of equals\\", BC Tel merged with Telus, the telephone operating company in Alberta. The merger created the second largest telephone company in Canada after Bell. Initially registered as BCT.Telus, the hunt for a new name began.

Eight people were killed\\"Survivor of Aum's '94 sarin attack dies while in coma\\" The Asahi Shimbun (August 6, 2008). and over 500 were harmed by sarin aerosol that was released from a converted refrigerator truck in the Kaichi Heights area. The attack was perpetrated nine months before the better known Tokyo subway sarin attack.  Sarin attack  The sarin attack occurred in a quiet residential area in the city of Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture. In carrying out the attack, Aum Shinrikyo had two goals; to attack three judges who were expected to rule against the cult in a lawsuit concerning a real estate dispute, and to test the efficiency of its sarin ‚Äî which the cult was manufacturing at one of its facilities ‚Äî as a weapon of mass murder.Kyle B. Olson, \\"Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?\\", Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Research Planning, Inc., Arlington, Virginia Residents of Matsumoto had also angered Aum founder Shoko Asahara by vigorously opposing his plan to set up an office and factory in the city's southern area. Opponents of the plan gathered 140,000 signatures on an anti-Aum petition, equivalent to 70 percent of Matsumoto's population at the time. Aum's original plan to release the aerosol into the Matsumoto courthouse was altered when the cult members arrived in the city after the courthouse had closed. The cult members decided to instead target a three-story apartment building where the city's judges resided. At 10:40 pm, members of Aum used a converted refrigerator truck to release a cloud of sarin which floated near the home of the judges. The truck's cargo space held a heating contraption that had been specifically designed to turn twelve litres of liquid sarin into an aerosol, and fans to diffuse the aerosol into the neighbourhood. At 11:30 pm, Matsumoto police received an urgent report from paramedics that casualties were being transported to hospital. The patients were suffering from darkened vision, eye pain, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, miosis, and numbness in their hands. Some victims described having seen a fog with a pungent and irritating smell floating by. A total of 274 people were treated. Five dead residents were discovered in their apartments, and two died in hospital immediately after admission. An eighth victim, Sumiko Kono, remained in a coma for fourteen years and died in 2008. The day after the attack, dead fish were found in a pond near the scene. The bodies of dogs, birds, and a large number of caterpillars were found in the area. Grass and trees had withered and the trees' leaves had discoloured. Nearly all of the casualties had been discovered within a radius of 150 metres from the centre, near the pond. People near open windows or in air-conditioned rooms had been exposed to the aerosol.

It was discovered that K≈çno had stored a large amount of pesticide in his residence. Although sarin cannot be manufactured from pesticides, Keiichi Tsuneishi, a Japanese historian, claimed the nerve agent is synthesizable from organophosphorus pesticides, and K≈çno was dubbed by some in the media \\"the Poison Gas Man\\". He subsequently received hate mail, death threats, and intense legal pressure. After the truth became known, every major Japanese newspaper apologized to K≈çno, including those that had not named him as a suspect. After the Tokyo attack, the blame was shifted to the cult Aum. Matsumoto's police chief, on behalf of the police department and media, publicly apologized to K≈çno. K≈çno's wife later awoke from her coma, but recovered neither speech nor body movement; she died in 2008. Several Aum members were found guilty of masterminding both incidents.

He first reported the sleeper effect after studying the effects of the Frank Capra's propaganda film Why We Fight on soldiers in the Army. In later studies on this subject, Hovland collaborated with Irving Janis who would later become famous for his theory of groupthink. Hovland also developed social judgment theory of attitude change. Carl Hovland thought that the ability of someone to resist persuasion by a certain group depended on your degree of belonging to the group. With the advent of government propaganda in support of the United States‚Äô participation in World War II, the artifacts worth investigating helped with increase of persuasive communication with intent to affect behavior, attitude, and values. These artifacts had a remarkable amount of money invested into them, however, were they effective? This concept of effectiveness and affecting change within individuals, interpersonal relations, and persuasion are exactly what Hovland was interested in. Carl Hovland's contributions to the field of communications were three-fold. First, he emphasized micro-level analysis, next he was interested in all facets of interpersonal communication, and finally he revolutionized persuasive research. Biography =Early life= Carl Iver Hovland was born in Chicago on June 12, 1912. In Chicago, he attended the Lloyd School and then completed high school at the Luther Institute. He entered Northwestern University at the age of 16, receiving his B.A. in 1932, and an M.A. the following year. He then transferred to Yale, where he obtained the Ph.D. in 1936. Except for a three-year research stint in Washington during World War II, Hovland remained associated with Yale the rest of his life, rising rapidly through the academic ranks to a Sterling Professorship at the age of 36. As a child, Hovland had a deep interest in music. In fact, up until college when psychology became a major part of his life he was looking into a musical career. At the age of six years, he read Latin textbooks fluently, beginning the development of the linguistic skills which were to be so important in his later studies of alchemy and religion.Joseph, Peterson \\"Carl Iver Hovland: 1912-1961\\", \\"The American Journal of Psychology\\", Dec. 1961. In 1938 he married Gertrude Raddatz, a piano student like Hovland, in Chicago.Sears, S. R. (1961). Carl Iver Hovland: 1912-1961. The American Journal of Psychology, 74(4). 637-639. University of Illinois Press. During the late 1930s and early 1940s Hovland made major contributions to several areas of human experimental psychology, such as the efficiency of different methods of rote learning. From his close association with Clark L. Hull and other psychologists working at the Yale Institute of Human Relations, Hovland developed a comprehensive view of the behavioral sciences that led him to extend the analytic experimental approach of research on human learning to underdeveloped areas of research in the human sciences. =Career= Hovland's first opportunity to work intensively in the underdeveloped area of social psychology arose during World War II, when he took a leave of absence from Yale for over 3 years to serve as a senior psychologist in the War Department. He was recruited by Samuel Stouffer, also a sociologist who was on leave from University of Chicago.Shepard, R. N. (n.d.). Carl iver hovland. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&page;=chovland.html Carl had the responsibility of leading a research team of fifteen researchers. His main role was to conduct experiments on the effectiveness of training and information programs that were intended to influence the motivation of men in the American armed forces.Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. Social Psychology. Upper Saddle River, N.J: Pearson Education, 2010. Print. He assembled a group of six psychology graduate students who worked with him on these studies for several years. One of the most widely cited of the pioneering experiments on opinion change by Hovland and his group involved testing the effects of a one-sided versus a two-sided presentation of a controversial issue. The results contradicted contentions of totalitarian propagandists, who claimed that a communication that presents only one side of the issue will generally be more successful than one that mentions the opposing side of the argument. These wartime studies were reported in Experiments on Mass Communication (1949), written jointly by Hovland, A. A. Lumsdaine, and F. D. Sheffield. Carl Hovland was a big man, soft in speech, gentle in manner, as incredibly quick and deft in physical movement as in intellection. In his earlier years he was quite shy, but the social rigors of the life to which his extraordinary talents inevitably exposed him helped to develop the quiet ease of manner that characterized his middle age. He was unfailingly cheerful, even in the last tragic year of his life, and continued to work with his students and colleagues until his brief final illness. It was this capacity for being always helpful, always objective, that placed him inconstant demand as a consultant, not only to students, but to all the leading Foundations, to half a dozen major Government agencies, and to the behavioral research arms of several great corporations. He was repeatedly honored by his colleagues in one way or another-as an APA representative to the Social Science Research Council, as a member of that Association's Board of Directors, by election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to the American Philosophical Society, and to the National Academy of Sciences.T he honor he appreciated most deeply, perhaps, was the award of the Warren Medal by the Society of Experimental Psychologists, word of which reached him only a month before his death. Psychological research was Hovland's intellectual joy however. Especially in his early career, his investigations covered a wide range of topics. By the time he had secured his doctorate, Hovland had published a dozen research papers and collected data for at least half a dozen. Four of these papers were in the American Journal of Physiology, two in the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, and others in psychological journals . His papers in psychological journals included a study of test reliability, a major review of the literature on apparent movement, as well as his four classical papers on conditioned generalization from his doctoral dissertation.Sears, R.R. Carl Iver Hovland: 1912-1961. THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, V. 74 (4), 11/1961, p. 637-639 After the war Hovland returned to Yale University, where he recruited several members of his wartime research team, with whom he continued to study the factors that influence the effectiveness of social communications. Among Hovland's best-known studies are those elucidating the influence of the communicator's prestige and the ways that prestige effects disappear with the passage of time. For example, Hovland and his collaborators showed that when a persuasive message is presented by an untrustworthy source, it tends to be discounted by the audience, so that immediately after exposure there is little or no attitude change; but then, after several weeks, the source is no longer associated with the issue in the minds of the audience and positive attitude changes appear. This \\"sleeper effect\\" was shown to vanish, as predicted, if the unacceptable communicator was \\"reinstated\\" several weeks later by reminding the audience about who had presented the earlier persuasive material. For 15 years Hovland and his group systematically investigated different ways of presenting arguments, personality factors, and judgmental processes that enter into attitude change. While pursuing his own research, Hovland continually encouraged his associates on the Yale project, a study of the conditions under which people are most likely to change their attitudes in response to persuasive messages. The Yale Group's work was first described in Hovland's book Communication and Persuasion, published in 1953.Hovland, Carl I., Irving L. Janis, and Harold H. Kelley.\\"Communication and Persuation: Psychological Studies of Opinion Change\\" New Haven: Yale UP, 1953. Print. His major interests in his last few years of life were with concept-formation, which he approached with computer simulation. In 1952 he published a demonstration that the problems of concept- learning can be solved by an hypothetical decoding machine, and also provided both a notational system and an analysis of the problem of concept-learning that were widely adopted by other researchers in this field. =Contributions= First, Hovland began to emphasize micro-level analysis of propaganda and its effects. Hovland's army experiments were the beginnings of that micro-level analysis of an individual. Hovland's ‚Äúcore conceptual variable was attitude.‚Äù With the pre existing research in the discipline being devoted to ‚Äúmeasuring attitudes and to investigating factors in involved in attitude change,‚Äù it was different for Hovland to come in and look at an individual's predisposition to action when exposed to persuasive messages. Hovland believed that if he was able to recognize the attitude an individual has towards a trigger, he would be able to predict the behavior and actions of an individual over time. However, there were many studies that argued the contrary and showed that ‚Äúan attitude toward a person or object does not predict or explain an individual‚Äôs overt behavior regarding that person or object.‚Äù This interesting revelation of low correlation did not necessarily render findings useless but instead led to further research on how under certain circumstances it was actually possible to change a person's behavior via their attitudes. While Hovland focused on an individual rather than a group level, he began to take into consideration interpersonal communication in the form of persuasion. Specifically, Hovland was responsible for carrying out a series of studies that contributed to the ‚Äúcumulative understanding of persuasion behavior that has never since been matched or even rivaled.‚Äù To test and apply his theorization Hovland worked proposed the SMCR Model. The SMCR model consists of four components ‚Äì Source Variables, Message Variables, Channel Variables, as well Receiver Variables. By manipulating each of these variables, Hovland was able to advance his ‚Äúmessage-learning approach to attitude change.‚Äù There were problems with his particular approach, however, in that by focusing on a single dimension of the SMCR model, Hovland was unable to do more than isolate a factor rather than study the synergy between the different variables. Although there were limitations to these studies, Hovland's steadfast and fastidious nature allowed for a body of research that was able to continuously investigate this interpersonal communication in the form of persuasion research. Along with not being able to investigate the interaction of the Source, Message, Channel Receiver elements and their interplay within a study, Hovland's research arguably had one more flaw. This flaw in Hovland's research was that communication happened in a singular direction and was furthermore linear in its nature. It is this linear communication that made Hovland and his research seem like an ‚Äúoversimplification‚Äù to some communication scholars. Hovland provided new research in the form of micro-level research, interpersonal research, as well as persuasive research. Hovland employed experimental research in his studies and was therefore able to trace causality between variables. He showed the effects of various elements in the SMCR model on persuasion: sources (high credibility vs. low credibility, sleeper effect), types of messages (one-sided vs. two-sided, fear appeals) and channels on cognitive and affective changes. Hovland's work was great as far as his experimental methods were concerned but critics of his work also found some important problems. In particular, he has been criticized by looking at individuals as unconnected to each other, although he was generalizing them as members of a media audience. He found strong cognitive effects of the war films on his audience but he may have prematurely declared the media as weak in their effects. Also, results from experiments cannot be generalized easily to the population. He wanted to establish laws of persuasion but had to be content with variable effects of his predictor variables on persuasion of individuals. =Death= In the last decade of his life Hovland's research on verbal concepts and judgment led him into an intensive analysis of concept formation. Once again he played a pioneering role in developing a new field of research - computer simulation of human thought processes. A month before his death, he was honored with the award of the Warren Medal by the Society of Experimental Psychologists.Sears, Robert (December 1961). \\"Carl Iver Hovland: 1912-1961\\".

When Hovland learned that he had cancer, he continued to work with his Yale doctoral students and conduct persuasion experiments. Finally, when he could work no more, he left his office in the Psychology Department, went to his home in New Haven, drew a bathtub full of water, and drowned himself (Schramm, in press b).Rogers, Everett M.A history of communication study.39:383. Further reading A summary of the research developments and theoretical ideas that have grown out of Hovland's pioneering projects is presented in a comprehensive chapter by Irving L. Janis and M. Brewster Smith in Herbert C. Kelman, ed., International Behavior: A Social-Psychological Analysis (1965). Hovland's work is also discussed in Arthur R. Cohen's Attitude Change and Social Influence (Basic Topics in Psychology) (1964).

It is a delayed increase of the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue. Figure A: Normal Decay Figure B: Sleeper Effect The sleeper effect When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase. Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication. This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient‚Äôs suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone. Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland & Weiss, 1951; Cook & Flay, 1978). For example, in political campaigns during important elections, undecided voters often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office. At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement. Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially. However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement). This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale & Albarrac√≠n, 2004; see also Cook & Flay, 1978). Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).  Controversy about the existence of a \\"sleeper effect\\"  One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect. The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception. After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist. The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the heuristic-systematic model and the elaboration likelihood model. However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met. Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if: :(a) the message is persuasive; :(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change; :(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and :(d) the message itself still has an effect on attitudes during the delayed post-test. Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met. According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source). First identified The sleeper effect was first identified in U.S. soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Hovland et al. measured the soldier‚Äôs opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda. It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days. The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group. The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time. Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect. They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes. Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect. These two formulations vary in that (a) forgetting suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) dissociation suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication. Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs. Figure A: Forgetting Figure B: Dissociation Figure C: Differential-Decay =Forgetting and dissociation= According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland & Weiss, 1951; Kelman & Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources. Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a World War II propaganda movie on American soldiers. With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers‚Äô surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up. This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect. According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one‚Äôs memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated. =Differential decay= Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset. To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur. Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller & Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content. Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an alternative hypothesis that differed from Hovland and his colleagues. They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis. Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

The manga was serialized in Manga Life and published by Takeshobo from 1997 to 2013. An anime television series adaptation was animated by J.C.Staff and aired on TV Tokyo from April 4, 2004 to June 27, 2004. An OVA series, titled Sensei no Ojikan Gold („Åõ„Çì„Åõ„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„ÅäÊôÇÈñì „ÅîÔΩû„Çã„Å©), was also animated by J.C.Staff and continued from where the TV series left off. These episodes were released onto the DVDs of the TV series, one episode for each DVD. Both the TV series and OVA were dubbed into English by Ocean Productions using their Blue Water Studios and have been licensed for release in North America by Geneon Entertainment. However, the OVA was folded onto the TV series and released together as simply Doki Doki School Hours. Thus, for the release in that region, the 14th episode is actually the first episode of the OVA and so on. The series is centered on 27-year-old homeroom teacher Mika Suzuki (who only looks about half her age) and the eccentric and colorful students of her class. The anime, coming two years after J.C.Staff had success with Azumanga Daioh, inherits a lot stylistically from that series, however the original manga predates Azumanga Daioh by two years. Additionally, before the recent anime incarnation, the manga spawned a series of drama CDs. Plot A very short 27-year-old teacher has an interesting time trying to teach her class. She has to deal with the eccentricities of her students as they present themselves over the school year. When you have an insane class (which includes a cross-dressing narcissist, an otaku, a dumb jock, a boy-band obsessed girl, a lesbian in love with the teacher, a homosexual in love with the jock, a guy who looks like a middle-aged man, a girl obsessed with material items and the vain rich girl), what's a person to do but hope? Characters ;, also known as Mika-sensei : :The 27-year old homeroom teacher of Class 2A who is unusually short. She is usually addressed, as given the nickname \\"Mika-sensei\\". Her short stature and generally \\"cute\\" appearance causes people to think her more childish than she is. Even so, she is not especially mature, still lives with her parents and dreads \\"measuring day\\". Mika also has a tendency to cry when things do not go her way. ; : :A brutally honest student who belongs to the cooking club. She is often shown moaning about being surrounded by idiots in her class, or telling people off. She loves slasher films. ; : :A girl who likes to sleep in class but outside of school she holds a part-time job as she loves to make money. She has also shown great concern about her appearance and weight, causing her to put herself on crash diets. She's very ditzy sometimes, like when she walked into the classroom and Anthony (an American exchange student) said \\"Hello!\\" in English: she came to the instant conclusion she had woken up in America. , also known as \\"Chairman (Iincho)\\" : :The Class President of Class 2A. She wanted to be class president due to her favorite pop star stating that he liked class presidents: she decided to be class president for the rest of her life. She is highly intelligent and friendly, but is seem at times being brutal to people, especially when they somehow insult her idol. ; : :A tall and very pretty girl who constantly teases Mika-sensei, as she finds her various moods cute. She is a lesbian and has stated on several occasion that she loves small girls, thus making it no surprise that she has a huge (and slightly sadistic) crush on Mika-sensei. She is constantly flirting with her, which often borders on molestation. She has an excellent body, which Kobayashi is jealous of, though she is fairly modest about it. She also does well academically, though she isn't above failing a test on purpose if it means she'll get to spend time with Mika-sensei. ; : :The athlete. Suetake knows nothing other than sports-related information. He is rather dumb and fails most things that don't involve sports, but he is also kind and good- natured. Kudo, who likes him, will often tutor him. ; : :A male honor student who is gay and in love with Suetake. He has poor self-control and is known as \\"the nosebleed king\\". Though Suetake is completely oblivious to Kudo's affections, everyone else is aware of them, and they are constantly rolling their eyes over his actions (which is very similar to how they react to Kitagawa's love for Mika, the only difference being that Mika is aware of Kitagawa's feelings, but can do little to stop her advances). He is seen having fantasies about Suetake, and not much else. A running gag is he will constantally have nose bleeds (in Japan, it is a sign of sexual arousal, especially in young men) brought on by Suetake's innocent comments and actions to the point of passing out and requiring medical attention. ; : :A student who used to love beautiful girls and turned into a narcissist, to the point that he usually goes to school in makeup. He goes on and on about how lovely a girl can be, if she uses the right products. Outside school, he has been seen in skirts and even a full ladies' kimono. Despite the two of them often stating that they dislike each other, he seems to have a good relationship with Kobayashi. Takumi \\"Watabe\\" Watanabe (Ê∏°ÈÉ®Âå† Watanabe Takumi) : :The head (and, originally, sole member) of the school's manga club. He has great artistic ability, but he's only ever seen drawing stereotypical bish≈çjo-type characters, and his obsession tends to get a little on the creepy side. He dislikes drawing men, and it's somewhat implied that he's not very good at doing so. Mika-sensei has occasionally shown interest in his work. Mika has often been the subject of his work, which has seems to have earned him a somewhat friendship with Kitakawa for his art of her. Gen Nakamura (‰∏≠ÊùëÂÖÉ Nakamura Gen), also known as \\"Old Man (Oyaji)\\" : :The 17-year-old student carries himself in a stereotypically \\"40-year-old\\" manner, and therefore is nicknamed \\"Old Man\\". Later in the series, it is hinted he has a crush on Iincho, and is occasionally mistaken for a pervert. Linda Matsumoto (ÊùæÊú¨„É™„É≥„ÉÄ Matsumoto Rinda), also known as Matsumoto-sensei : :Okitsu High School's Doctor and Mika's best friend on the faculty. Chinatsu Nakayama (‰∏≠Â±±ÂçÉÂ§è Nakayama Chinatsu) : :A member of Takumi Watanabe's manga club who, ironically, is terrible at drawing manga. She idolises and has a large crush on Takumi. He seems to know, but manages to throw her off. Anthony M.Chamberlain („Ç¢„É≥„ÇΩ„Éã„Éº„ÉªM„Éª„ÉÅ„Çß„É≥„Éê„É¨„É≥) : :A transfer student who is studying abroad from America.

Suggested identities of the persons from left to right are Dhurmia, a Jain pandit holding a palm-leaf manuscript, Cavelli Venkata Lechmiah, a Telugu Brahmin pandit, Colin Mackenzie in the red uniform of the East India Company and Kistnaji, a peon holding a telescope. The background was said by early commentators to be the statue of Gomateshwara at Shravanabelagola but Howes (2010) identifies it as Karkala. The hill to the left of the statue has a basket-and-pole used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Colonel Colin Mackenzie CB (1754‚Äì8 May 1821) was Scottish army officer in the British East India Company who later became the first Surveyor General of India. He was a collector of antiquities and an orientalist. He surveyed southern India, making use of local interpreters and scholars to study religion, oral histories, inscriptions and other evidence initially out of personal interest and later as a surveyor. He was ordered to survey the Mysore region shortly after the British victory over Tipu Sultan in 1799 and produced the first maps of the region along with illustrations of the landscape and notes on archaeological landmarks. His collections consisting of thousands of manuscripts, inscriptions, translations, coins and paintings, which were acquired after his death by the India Office Library and are an important source for the study of Indian history. He was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815.East-India Register and Directory Early life Crop from Thomas Hickey's painting Colin Mackenzie was born in Stornoway on Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, the second son of merchant Murdoch Mackenzie (who was the first postmaster of the town) and Barbara around 1753 or 1754. Little is known of his early life but he is thought to have started his work as a Comptroller of the Customs at Stornoway from 1778 to 1783, possibly through the influence of his father's association with the Mackenzie Earls of Seaforth. In his youth he had an interest in mathematics possibly fostered by his schoolmaster, a freemason, Alexander Anderson. Lord Kenneth Mackenzie (last Earl of Seaforth) and Francis (fifth Lord Napier) sought his help in preparing a biography of John Napier and his work on logarithms. When Lord Napier died in 1773, Kenneth Mackenzie helped Colin to obtain commission with the British East India Company to join the Madras Army. When he arrived in Madras on 2 September 1783 he was thirty and was never to return home again. He joined as a Cadet in the Infantry division but was transferred in 1786 as a Cadet of Engineers. India Arriving in India he first met the daughter of Lord Francis Napier, Hester (d. 1819). Hester was married to Samuel Johnston who worked as a civil servant at Madurai (their son Alexander Johnston later became a judge in Sri Lanka, founded the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie). Hester introduced Mackenzie to some Brahmins to obtain information on Hindu mathematical traditions as part of the biographical memoir on John Napier and the history of logarithms. The biography project appears to have been subsequently dropped but Colin continued to take an interest in antiquities. For the first thirteen years in India, he was busy with military duties. He began in Coimbatore and Dindigul around 1783 followed by engineering duties in Madras, Nellore and Guntur and during the campaign against Mysore from 1790 to 1792. In 1793 he saw action in the Siege of Pondicherry. He was posted as a commanding engineer to Ceylon and returned in 1796. He rose in rank starting from a second lieutenant on 16 May 1783, first lieutenant on 6 March 1789; and captain 16 August 1793. Major by 1 Jan 1806 rising on to become a colonel on 12 August 1819. It was after his return from Ceylon that he was able to follow his interest in antiquities. =Mysore survey= Nandidrug in October 1791 with the batteries firing. The positions of the batteries was decided by Mackenzie and Lord Cornwallis commended Mackenzie for his role in the victory over Tipu Sultan. In 1799, Mackenzie was part of the British force in the Battle of Seringapatam, where Tipu Sultan, Maharaja of Mysore was defeated. After the defeat of Tipu, he led the Mysore survey between 1799 and 1810 and one of the aims was to establish the boundaries of the state as well as the territories ceded by the Nizam. The survey consisted of interpreters, a team of draftsmen and illustrators who collected material on the natural history, geography, architecture, history, customs, and folk tales of the region. Mackenzie's map of southern India (1808) When he began the survey, he was concerned that he had no linguistic skills and was more appalled by the lack of British competence in south Indian languages. Around the same time, the trigonometric survey was proposed by William Lambton but there was little collaboration between the two during the Mysore survey. Mackenzie was told that his survey was not to be \\"mere military or geographical information, but that your enquiries are to be extended to a statistical account of the whole country.\\" However he was not provided enough resources for this grand plan. He wrote to Barry Close that he would not \\"descend to the minutiae\\" of measuring cultivated and uncultivated land but would instead focus on that which was of political and military importance. He pointed out that enquiries into revenues created uneasiness. One of his chief interpreters was a man named Kavelli Venkata Boria (IAST kƒÅvelƒ´ ve·πÉke·π≠ƒÅ boraiyƒÅ·∏•, there are variations in spelling) who Mackenzie first met in 1796, shortly after his return from Ceylon. He found Boria capable of dealing with all sects and considered him as \\"the first step of my introduction into the portal of Indian knowledge.\\" Boria knew Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Sankskrit. In 1797, Mackenzie visited Mudgeri and found the ruins of a Jain temple. He wrote an extensive note on the Jains based on interviews through his translator \\"Cavelly Boria\\". Boria died in 1803 and Mackenzie took in his brother Venkata Lechmiah (IAST lak·π£maiyyƒÅ, also spelt Lakshmaiah or Lakshmayya). Another of Mackenzie's assistant was Dhurmiah (IAST dharmayƒÅ·∏•), a Jain pandit (scholar) from Maleyur, then in Mysore State. Dhurmiah, with his ability to read Hale Kannada (old Kannada) inscriptions contributed greatly to the study of the inscriptions in the region. Dhurmiah provided Mackenzie with Jain insights into the history of India but some ideas were considered too unreliable such as the idea that the Jains had fled from Mecca. Dhurmiah's son may also have been on Mackenzie's staff. Another orientalist, Mark Wilks interviewed Dhurmiah and wrote on the Jains in his 1817 Historical Sketches of the South of India. Stating the aims of his survey, he wrote from the perspective of a historian in a letter to Major Merwick Shawe in 1805: =Amaravati= Mudgeri and at Amaravati (1809) Among Mackenzie's vast collection of illustrations is a set of 85 sketches made at Amaravati. He appears to have first visited the site in 1798 and conducted more systematic studies between 1816 and 1820 after he became a Surveyor General and three copies of these documents were made. One was deposited at the Library of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, another at Madras and one in the British Library at London. Only the London copy survives. Sketches of the site were made by John Newman, draftsman for Mackenzie from 1810 to 1818. About 132 stones were found by Mackenzie but these are no longer traceable. Mackenzie believed that the site was related to the Jain religion and had no idea of Buddhism in India. The stones from Amaravati were brought to Masulipatam but many were not taken to ship but deposited into a mound that came to be known as \\"Robertson's Mound\\" after Francis W. Robertson who was Assistant Collector at Masulipatnam from 1814 to 1817. Most of these were subsequently moved to the Madras Museum along with Sir Walter Elliot's collections from Amaravati. About 79 stones depicted in the Mackenzie drawings are unaccounted for and are not traceable to collections in museums. Java This inscription was found at Ngendat near Malang and gifted by Raffles to Lord Minto who took it back home and now goes by the name of Minto Stone. Mackenzie spent two years (1811-1812/13) in Java, during the period of British occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. On 18 November 1812, while in Java, he married Petronella Jacomina Bartels at a local Lutheran Church. Petronella was born in Ceylon and was of Dutch ancestry. In 1814, Stamford Raffles having heard of Mackenzie's work in India, wanted him to survey Java and report on its monuments. Since Mackenzie had then moved back to India, the team was led by H. C. Cornelius (who had accompanied Mackenzie earlier) who was also responsible for the work involved in removing the debris from the buried ruins of Borobodur. His report on the survey of Java included many watercolours illustrating life during that period. These were published in three volumes. The first was titled Antiquities & Costume(s) of Java, 1812-13 and includes drawings and sketches some of which were made use of by Raffles in his History of Java. The second volume bore the title A Collection of Monuments, Images, Sculptures &c.; illustrative of The Ancient History, Religion & Institutions of the Island of Java and of the Adjacent Isles: Taken under the immediate Inspection & Direction of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Mackenzie in the course of a Tour & of different Excursions through the Island of Java in the years 1811-1812 & 1813 and included numerous sketches and a few watercolours. The third volume Views, Plans and Maps on the Island of Java carried some pencil drawn maps. Surveyor General of India 1816 map of Pondicherry signed by Colin Mackenzie (National Archives of India) In 1757, the East India Company under Lord Clive had appointed James Rennell as Surveyor General for Bengal. Colin Mackenzie was appointed Surveyor General of Madras Presidency in 1810 but these posts were abolished in 1815. After his returning to India, in June 1815, he was invested as a Companion of the Bath. He returned to continue surveys of eastern India from the Krishna to Cape Comorin. On 26 May 1815 he was appointed Surveyor General of India with his headquarters at Fort William in Calcutta but he was allowed to stay on in Madras to help reorganize the surveys. He stayed there till May 1817 during which period he worked on planning surveys and examining earlier surveys. He appointed Benjamin Swain Ward (1786-1835) to survey Travancore, Lieutenant Peter Eyre Conner (born 5 August 1789, died 29-April-1821 at Hyderabad) (Sometimes given only as Lt. Connor) for Coorg (then written as Codugu or Koorg), Francis Mountford (1790-1824) to Guntur and James Garling (1784-1820) to the Nizam's territories. By 1816 Garling had used a triangulation system similar to that of Lambton to work out the position of the ruins of Bijapur and was moving northwards. While Garling's work was appreciated by the surveyors of Bombay, he was rebuked by Mackenzie whose orders restricted him to the Nizam's territory. The government in an attempt to hasten his move to Calcutta sent the yacht, HC Phoenix to transport him and his family from Madras on 24 June 1816. The captain, Criddle, was ordered to take him to survey the Pulicat and Armegon Shoals before taking him to Calcutta. Mackenzie however set about to his work and did not board the yacht. The government then wrote that he should use the survey ship Sophia which was to bring Sir John Malcolm to Madras in May 1817. He finally set sail to Calcutta on 17 July 1817 aboard Sophia. When Mackenzie moved from Madras to Calcutta, Lechmiah was retained. Death and after Cover of Saturday Magazine 28 June 1834 carrying Sir Alexander Johnston's evidence placed before a Committee of the House of Commons He died on 8 May 1821 at his home in Calcutta, India, and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery. His widow, Petronella, offered the collections to the Bengal Government at a tentative price of Rs 20,000. The law firm Palmer and co. did an assessment of the collections and arrived at a figure of Rs 100,000 as a 'reasonable reimbursement' and the Bengal Government acquired the collections. In 1823 Petronella married Lt. Robert Page Fulcher at the Cape of Good Hope. Fulcher was a fellow traveller on the ship to England and her original plan was to move to Stornoway to live with Colin's sister. Mackenzie's Will left 5% to Lechmiah. Much of his collection of documents, manuscripts, artifacts, and artworks is now in the British Museum and the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library, though part of it remains in the Government Museum in Madras. Samuel and Hester Johnston's son, Sir Alexander Johnston, wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie. After Mackenzie's death, Lechmiah continued to help Horace Hayman Wilson in cataloguing the collections. He applied to the Madras division of the Asiatic Society to continue work on the collections made by his master. This was rejected on the grounds that no oriental could handle the managerial and critical work. James Prinsep declared that \\"..The qualifications of Cavelly Venkata for such an office, judging of them by his 'abstract,' or indeed of any native, could hardly be pronounced equal to such a task...\\". Lechmiah was the only Indian admitted to the Madras Literary Society which was founded in 1817 and in 1833, Lechmiah founded a parallel Madras Hindu Literary Society as a means of continuing his work. Sir Alexander Johnston supported this venture which also got the support of Captain Henry Harkness (author of a book on Indian scripts) and George Norton (a radical Advocate-General who was against government support for Christian missionaries support for but this organization did not survive long. A missionary in Madras, William Taylor was chosen for the job. Taylor has been described as a poor scholar (with a defective knowledge of the Devanagari script) if not a deranged antiquarian by Dirks (1993). Lechmiah received a monthly pension of 300 rupees and was given a grant of a Shotrium (or Shrotrium), land given as a reward for Civil officers. Three other brothers Ramaswamie, Narasimhalu (Naraseemoloo) and Sitayya (Seetiah) also worked for Mackenzie but the latter two were mainly as minor assistants. Ramaswamie later published extensively in English. His works included a book on the cities of the Deccan (Descriptive and Historical Sketches of Cities and Places in the Dekkan...), a biography of Deccan poets (1829), a cookbook translated in 1836 from a Telugu book written by Saraswati Bai (Pakasastra, otherwise Called Soopasastra, or the Modern Culinary Receipts of the Hindoos), a book on caste in 1837. Studies of the maps made by Mackenzie's survey are considered to have the potential to highlight interesting archaeological sites as well as provide information on the organization and structure of poligar chiefdoms which were dismantled after British takeover.

In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to‚Äîor expect consequences as the result of‚Äîa universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, and/or order, and is often associated with a variety of fundamental fallacies, especially in regard to rationalizing people's suffering on the grounds that they \\"deserve\\" it. The hypothesis popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: \\"you got what was coming to you\\", \\"what goes around comes around\\", \\"chickens come home to roost\\", \\"everything happens for a reason\\", and \\"you reap what you sow\\". This hypothesis has been widely studied by social psychologists since Melvin J. Lerner conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s. Research has continued since then, examining the predictive capacity of the hypothesis in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs. Emergence Many philosophers and social theorists have observed and considered the phenomenon of belief in a just world, going back to at least as early as the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, writing circa 180 CE, who argued against this belief.Sextus Empiricus, \\"Outlines of Pyrrhonism\\", Book 1, Chapter 13, Section 32 Lerner's work made the just-world hypothesis a focus of research in the field of social psychology. =Melvin Lerner= Lerner was prompted to study justice beliefs and the just-world hypothesis in the context of social psychological inquiry into negative social and societal interactions. Lerner saw his work as extending Stanley Milgram's work on obedience. He sought to answer the questions of how regimes that cause cruelty and suffering maintain popular support, and how people come to accept social norms and laws that produce misery and suffering. Lerner's inquiry was influenced by repeatedly witnessing the tendency of observers to blame victims for their suffering. During his clinical training as a psychologist, he observed treatment of mentally ill persons by the health care practitioners with whom he worked. Although Lerner knew them to be kindhearted, educated people, they often blamed patients for the patients' own suffering. Lerner also describes his surprise at hearing his students derogate (disparage, belittle) the poor, seemingly oblivious to the structural forces that contribute to poverty. In a study on rewards, he observed that when one of two men was chosen at random to receive a reward for a task, that caused him to be more favorably evaluated by observers, even when the observers had been informed that the recipient of the reward was chosen at random. Existing social psychological theories, including cognitive dissonance, could not fully explain these phenomena. The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis. Early evidence In 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to victimization. In the first of these experiments conducted at the University of Kansas, 72 female participants watched what appeared to be a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, these observing participants were upset by the victim's apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to reject and devalue the victim. Rejection and devaluation of the victim was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when participants were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, the participants did not derogate the victim. Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers. Theory To explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of \\"contract\\" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion. Lerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be rational or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include denial, withdrawal, and reinterpretation of the event. There are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim. In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving. Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics. Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation in different contexts. An additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal vulnerability because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes. This is related to the self-serving bias observed by social psychologists. Many researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of causal attribution. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution. Alternatives =Veridical judgment= Others have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason. A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay & L. Berkowitz (Eds.), Altruism and helping behavior (pp. 205‚Äì229). New York: Academic Press. =Guilt reduction= Another alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of guilt. Observers may feel responsible, or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim. Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty. =Discomfort reduction= Alternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by empathizing. Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to Ervin Staub, devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. Psychopathy has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy. Additional evidence After Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and domestic violence, illnesses, and poverty. Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character. In the early 1970s, social psychologists Zick Rubin and Letitia Anne Peplau developed a measure of belief in a just world. This measure and its revised form published in 1975 allowed for the study of individual differences in just-world beliefs. Much of the subsequent research on the just-world hypothesis used these measurement scales. These studies on victims of violence, illness, and poverty and others like them have provided consistent support for the link between observers' just-world beliefs and their tendency to blame victims for their suffering. As a result, the existence of the just-world hypothesis as a psychological phenomenon has become widely accepted. =Violence= Researchers have looked at how observers react to victims of rape and other violence. In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics. These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal). Other researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of battered partners. One study found that observers' labels of blame of female victims of relationship violence increase with the intimacy of the relationship. Observers blamed the perpetrator only in the most significant case of violence, in which a male struck an acquaintance. =Bullying= Researchers have employed the just-world hypothesis to understand bullying. Given other research on beliefs in a just world, it would be expected that observers would derogate and blame bullying victims, but the opposite has been found: individuals high in just-world belief have stronger anti-bullying attitudes. Other researchers have found that strong belief in a just world is associated with lower levels of bullying behavior. This finding is in keeping with Lerner's understanding of belief in a just world as functioning as a \\"contract\\" that governs behavior. There is additional evidence that belief in a just world is protective of the well-being of children and adolescents in the school environment, as has been shown for the general population. =Illness= Other researchers have found that observers judge sick people as responsible for their illnesses. One experiment showed that persons suffering from a variety of illnesses were derogated on a measure of attractiveness more than healthy individuals were. In comparison to healthy people, victim derogation was found for persons presenting with indigestion, pneumonia, and stomach cancer. Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer. Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of AIDS victims. =Poverty= More recently, researchers have explored how people react to poverty through the lens of the just-world hypothesis. Strong belief in a just world is associated with blaming the poor, with weak belief in a just world associated with identifying external causes of poverty including world economic systems, war, and exploitation. =The self as victim= Some research on belief in a just world has examined how people react when they themselves are victimized. An early paper by Dr. Ronnie Janoff-Bulman found that rape victims often blame their own behavior, but not their own characteristics, for their victimization. It was hypothesized that this may be because blaming one's own behavior makes an event more controllable. Theoretical refinement Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research. Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world, beliefs in immanent justice and ultimate justice, hope for justice, and belief in one's ability to reduce injustice. Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc. An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with positive mental health. Correlates Researchers have used measures of belief in a just world to look at correlates of high and low levels of belief in a just world. Limited studies have examined ideological correlates of the belief in a just world. These studies have found sociopolitical correlates of just-world beliefs, including right-wing authoritarianism and the Protestant work ethic. Studies have also found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of religiousness. Studies of demographic differences, including gender and racial differences, have not shown systemic differences, but do suggest racial differences, with blacks and African Americans having the lowest levels of belief in a just world. The development of measures of just-world beliefs has also allowed researchers to assess cross-cultural differences in just-world beliefs. Much research conducted shows that beliefs in a just world are evident cross-culturally. One study tested beliefs in a just world of students in 12 countries. This study found that in countries where the majority of inhabitants are powerless, belief in a just world tends to be weaker than in other countries. This supports the theory of the just-world hypothesis because the powerless have had more personal and societal experiences that provided evidence that the world is not just and predictable. Belief in unjust world has been linked to increased self-handicapping, criminality, defensive coping, anger and perceived future risk. It may also serve as ego-protective belief for certain individuals by justifying maladaptive behavior. Current research =Positive mental health effects= Although much of the initial work on belief in a just world focused on its negative social effects, other research suggests that belief in a just world is good, and even necessary, for mental health. Belief in a just world is associated with greater life satisfaction and well-being and less depressive affect. Researchers are actively exploring the reasons why the belief in a just world might have this relationship to mental health; it has been suggested that such beliefs could be a personal resource or coping strategy that buffers stress associated with daily life and with traumatic events. This hypothesis suggests that belief in a just world can be understood as a positive illusion. In line with this perspective, recent research also suggests that belief in a just world may explain the known statistical association between religiosity/spirituality and psychological well-being Some studies also show that beliefs in a just world are correlated with internal locus of control. Strong belief in a just world is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life. This may be one way in which belief in a just world affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs in a just world for oneself. Beliefs in a just world for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies. =International research= More than 40 years after Lerner's seminal work on belief in a just world, researchers continue to study the phenomenon. Work continues primarily in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Researchers in Germany have contributed disproportionately to recent research. Their work resulted in a volume edited by Lerner and German researcher Leo Montada titled Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World (1998).

The series centers on a group of teenagers who travel to the virtual world of Lyoko to battle against a malignant artificial intelligence known as X.A.N.A. who threatens Earth with powers to access the real world and cause trouble. The scenes in the real world are presented in 2D hand-drawn animation, while the scenes in Lyoko are presented in 3D CGI animation. The series began its first, 97-episode run on 3 September 2003, on France's France 3, and ended on 10 November 2007. It started airing in the United States on 19 April 2004 on Cartoon Network. Code Lyoko aired every day on Cartoon Network, and was also in their Miguzi and Master Control programming blocks, at 5:00 or 5:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, sometimes even showing two new back-to-back episodes consecutively, in the cases of season finales. On 31 May 2011, the MoonScoop Group announced on its Facebook page that the show would be returning for a fifth season. This follow-up series was officially named Code Lyoko: Evolution, which began airing at the end of 2012. This \\"sequel\\" to the series featured live-action sequences for scenes taking place in the real world instead of its traditional 2D animation but retained the iconic CGI for scenes taking place in Lyoko, now with an updated style. The show consisted of 26 episodes with the final episode airing in late 2013, leaving off on a cliffhanger with no second season planned as Moonscoop later filed for bankruptcy in 2014.  Plot  Jeremy Belpois, a 14-year-old prodigy attending boarding school at Kadic Academy, discovers a quantum supercomputer in an abandoned factory near his school. Upon activating it, he discovers a virtual world called Lyoko with an artificially intelligent girl named Aelita trapped inside it. Jeremy learns of X.A.N.A., a fully autonomous, malevolent, and highly intelligent multi-agent system, that also dwells within the Supercomputer. Using Lyoko's powers, X.A.N.A can possess electronics and objects in the real world like a virus to wreak havoc. X.A.N.A.'s primary objective is to eliminate anyone aware of the Supercomputer's existence so that it will be free to conquer the real world and destroy all humanity. Jeremy works tirelessly to materialize Aelita into the real world and stop attacks caused by X.A.N.A. Jeremy is aided by his three friends Odd Della Robbia, Ulrich Stern, and Yumi Ishiyama, who are virtualized into Lyoko to save both worlds from the sinister virtual entity. They achieve this by escorting Aelita to various Towers on Lyoko, which serve as interface terminals between Lyoko and Earth. Once the Tower is deactivated, Jeremy can launch a \\"Return to the Past\\" program, which sends the world back in time, while anyone scanned into the Supercomputer retains memory of the other timeline, to undo any damage caused by X.A.N.A. In \\"Code: Earth,\\" Aelita is finally materialized, but the group discovers that X.A.N.A. had planted a virus inside of her that will kill her if the Supercomputer is turned off. They realize that they cannot destroy X.A.N.A, or Aelita will be destroyed along with it. Aelita adjusts to life in the real world, while Jeremy attempts to develop an antivirus program to liberate her from X.A.N.A.'s power. On Lyoko, a fifth sector is discovered and the group explores more of Lyoko's secrets and mysteries. The gang begins to uncover information about a mysterious man named Franz Hopper, who went missing ten years ago. He supposedly created the Supercomputer, Lyoko, and X.A.N.A., and is eventually discovered to be Aelita's father. They finally find out that Franz Hopper is indeed alive somewhere, hiding in the uncharted parts of Lyoko to avoid X.A.N.A. further. All the while, X.A.N.A. attempts to steal Aelita's memory to gain the Keys to Lyoko and free itself. At the end of the season, the group discovers that Aelita is actually human and does not have a virus, and instead is missing a fragment of herself. In \\"The Key,\\" X.A.N.A. tricks them with a fake and succeeds in stealing Aelita's memory and escaping the Supercomputer. Aelita appears to perish as a result but is revived when Franz Hopper restores her completely, along with her missing fragment: the memories of her life on Earth before she was virtualized on Lyoko. Since succeeding in escaping the confinements of the supercomputer, X.A.N.A. targets the virtual world itself by destroying each of Lyoko's surface sectors, until only Carthage (Sector 5) is left. Initially reluctant, the Lyoko Warriors decide to invite William Dunbar as the sixth member. However, shortly after being virtualized, he is possessed by X.A.N.A. via the Scyphozoa. Shortly after, he destroys the Core of Lyoko, destroying the entire virtual world and rendering the group unable to fight X.A.N.A., putting the entire real world in danger. After what they thought was their defeat, Jeremy receives a coded message from Franz Hopper that allows him to recreate Lyoko and continue the fight against X.A.N.A. Jeremy and Aelita construct a digital submarine, the Skidbladnir, to travel across the Digital Sea to destroy X.A.N.A.'s \\"Replikas,\\" which are copies of Lyoko's sectors that are linked to X.A.N.A.-controlled supercomputers on Earth, all created for its goal of world domination. X.A.N.A. uses William as its general throughout the season to defend the Replikas and target the Lyoko Warriors in any way he can. To prevent suspicion regarding William's disappearance, Jeremy manages to program a spectre to take William's place at Kadic, although the clone has low-level intelligence and acts very stupid. Near the end of the season, X.A.N.A. decides to draw energy from all of its Replikas to create the Kolossus, a gigantic monster that later destroys the Skidbladnir. Before it is destroyed, Jeremy frees William from X.A.N.A.'s control. After his return, he has a difficult time gaining the trust of the group. While Ulrich defeats the Kolossus, Franz Hopper sacrifices himself to power Jeremy's \\"anti-X.A.N.A. program,\\" which destroys X.A.N.A. forever upon activation. Shortly after, the group, albeit reluctant due to their nostalgia, decides to shut down the Supercomputer.  Episodes   Characters  = Main (Lyoko Warriors) = Jeremy Belpois (French: J√©r√©my Belpois; formerly Jeremie (French: J√©r√©mie) in season 1) :Voiced by: Rapha√´lle Bruneau (French); Sharon Mann (English) :A 14-year-old top-of-the-class student who finds and starts the factory's supercomputer while looking for parts to build a robot. By turning on the Supercomputer, he reawakened Aelita, the virtual world of Lyoko, and the malevolent multi-agent system X.A.N.A.. His goals are mainly driven by his desire to protect Aelita, whom he has a crush on, and to save her from the Supercomputer and X.A.N.A. by materializing her on Earth. As part of the group, he specializes in programming new ways to defeat X.A.N.A. and monitors the group while they are on Lyoko. Because he is not very athletic and is more computer savvy, Jeremy almost never goes to Lyoko, only going there once and vowing to never do it again. His workaholic attitude occasionally puts a strain on his relationships with the other members of the group. Aelita Schaeffer :Voiced by: Sophie Landresse (French); Sharon Mann (English) :Mainly known by her alias Aelita Stones, Aelita is the smartest of the group alongside Jeremy. At the beginning of the series, she was trapped on Lyoko, inside the Supercomputer. She was originally thought to be an AI until it was revealed that she's the daughter of Franz Hopper, the creator of Lyoko. As a little girl, she lost her mother. When a group of suited men came to her home, she and her father fled and virtualized themselves on Lyoko. Between the virtualization and Jeremy's discovery of the Supercomputer, X.A.N.A. stole an important memory fragment that inhibited her from becoming fully human again. After this fragment is retrieved, she is no longer linked to the Supercomputer. After becoming human, she often has nightmares of her past life. She later enrolls as a boarder at Kadic under the name Aelita Stones, claiming to be Odd's cousin. She reciprocates Jeremy's feelings for her, but he often strains their relationship by overlooking Aelita and her passions in favor of working on the Supercomputer. :Aelita is the only one capable of deactivating towers on Lyoko to stop X.A.N.A.'s attacks. On Lyoko, she has an elf-like appearance, similar to that of \\"Mr. P√ºck,\\" a toy elf from her childhood. She has the \\"power of creation:\\" the ability to create or remove objects, such as rocks or bridges, from the virtual environment. She had no weapons or defense until season 3 of the show when she developed the ability to use \\"energy fields,\\" pink balls of plasma that can be thrown or used to block enemy fire. In season 4, Jeremy programs light pink angel wings as part of her new virtual attire, allowing her to fly. Odd Della Robbia :Voiced by: Rapha√´lle Bruneau (French); Matthew G√©czy (English) :The comic relief of the group. Odd is credited as having great potential when it comes to school, but rarely uses it, and as a result of this, he gets bad grades due to his lack of studying. He shares a dorm with Ulrich and has a dog named Kiwi, who he hides in a dresser because pets aren't allowed at Kadic. He's considered a ladies' man and has dated many of the girls at his school, but his romances tend to last only a few days. Before he attended Kadic, he lived with his parents and his five sisters. Odd's blond hair has a purple spot and is worn up in a spike. :On Lyoko, he is clothed like a cat, with a tail and clawed gloves that shoot \\"laser arrows.\\" In season 1 he had a precognitive power named \\"Future Flash\\", but it was deleted before season 2. In season 2, Odd gains the ability to summon a purple shield by crossing his arms in front of his body. Another one of Odd's abilities is being able to use his claws to climb on walls. Ulrich Stern :Voiced by: Marie-Line Landerwijn (French); Barbara Weber-Scaff (English) :A more reserved member of the group, Ulrich has a hard time sharing his feelings. His parents pressure him to achieve well in school, but he has difficulty learning and living up to their expectations. In his off-time, he practices Pencak silat with Yumi, whom he has a crush on. He suffers from vertigo, which makes it hard to participate in activities such as rock climbing. Due to his many activities, Ulrich has a rather muscular build, thus many girls (particularly Sissi) consider him to be extremely handsome. :On Lyoko, he wears a yellow and brown outfit inspired by Japanese samurai. His main weapon is a katana, and can dual wield them. His \\"Supersprint\\" ability allows him to dash at high speed, and his \\"Triplicate\\" power lets him create two clones of himself. He can combine these abilities in a technique called \\"Triangulate,\\" using his clones to form a triangle around an enemy and ambush it. Yumi Ishiyama :Voiced by: G√©raldine Frippiat (French); Mirabelle Kirkland (English) :A fairly reserved student who lives near and attends Kadic. She is the oldest of the group. She is of Japanese descent and has one younger brother, Hiroki. Because of her parents and culture, she must maintain good grades and observe family values. At home, she generally has to deal with marital issues between her parents. She is a friend of William Dunbar, who transferred to Kadic during season 2. She practices pencak silat with Ulrich, whom she has a crush on, though it's not as obvious as Ulrich's crush on her. She always wears black and has enough basic knowledge of the Supercomputer to operate it in Jeremy and Aelita's absence. :On Lyoko, Yumi is dressed in a geisha-inspired outfit with an obi sash. Her main weapon is a tessen fan, and her power is telekinesis, allowing her to move objects with her mind. William Dunbar :Voiced by: Mathieu Moreau (French); David Gasman (English) :An overconfident student who starts attending Kadic Academy after he was expelled from his previous school for vandalism. Yumi befriends him and he soon develops feelings for her. He often fights with Ulrich for Yumi's attention and is sometimes disrespectful of Yumi's boundaries, causing her to become frustrated with his unwanted advances. After proving helpful to the group out during several X.A.N.A. attacks, they vote on whether he should be allowed to join the group, but Yumi votes no and his memory is erased. Eventually, however, the vote becomes unanimous when William's membership is deemed necessary. :On his first mission on Lyoko, William is captured and possessed by X.A.N.A., who ensnares William as its puppet. From that point on, a clone of William, created by Jeremy, is used to pose as the real William until Jeremy is able to free him. Unfortunately, Jeremy's program is imperfect, causing the William clone to act either unintelligent or unpredictable. Near the end of the series, the clone starts developing several human-like traits, which he eventually uses to help the warriors. Towards the end of the series, William is finally released from X.A.N.A.'s control. :On Lyoko, William wears a white outfit and carries a giant sword, which can release shock waves. Under X.A.N.A.'s control, his outfit turns black and he gains a spiked gauntlet on his wrist, which can be used for defence. He has an array of powers including enhanced strength; \\"Supersmoke,\\" which allows him to transform into a cloud of black smoke and move around at great speed, eventually gaining the ability to fly as well; a second sight allowing him to see across great distances; and levitation. X.A.N.A. sends William to stop the Lyoko Warriors on the virtual world, and thanks to his various powers, he proves to be a formidable opponent. = Antagonists = X.A.N.A. :Sometimes known as XANA, is an evil computer virus based on a multi-agent system. It serves as the central antagonist of the series. It was originally created by Franz Hopper to destroy Project Carthage: a military software system that Franz Hopper had previously been involved with. He mentions that his motives were to prevent the French government from obtaining access to Project Carthage. Unfortunately, due to his repeated returns to the past, X.A.N.A. evolved until it achieved self- awareness, choosing to betray Franz and trap him and his daughter Aelita inside Lyoko. Franz has no choice but to shut down the Supercomputer to stop its rampage. After it was reawakened in the present day, X.A.N.A. continues to wreak havoc on Earth and displays no mercy towards those who stand in its way. It eventually grows more powerful with every return in time, and conceives of greater plans and goals beyond random destruction. :X.A.N.A. has no actual physical form as a program. Instead, X.A.N.A. activates Lyoko structures called \\"Towers\\" to act in the real world, by manifesting extensions of its multi-agent system as powerful, electrical viruses inside networks, and can also make them emerge as spectres from outlets at will. Using these extensions, X.A.N.A. can manipulate electricity, hack networks, and possess electronics, objects, and living things to manipulate to its will, which are usually marked with its eye symbol as a sign of its control. It uses these unearthly abilities for attacks and schemes on Earth. X.A.N.A. eventually learns to possess humans to control them, pixelize vessels to give them special abilities (spectral bodies, increased physical abilities, electrical powers, levitation, etc.), and create polymorphic spectres that impersonate others and have pixelated powers. On Lyoko, it virtualizes monsters to fight and attack targets, and uses programming abilities to alter sectors, create illusions, imprison enemies, use bugs or viruses, or manipulate warriors. :The only known physical incarnation of X.A.N.A. appeared in season 1, in the episode titled \\"Ghost Channel,\\" where after having its disguise as Jeremy being exposed, he transformed into a demonic caricature figure of Jeremy and tried to kill all of the Warriors. X.A.N.A.'s voice was provided by David Gasman in this episode. :As X.A.N.A. continues to increase its power, its ambitions also develop throughout the series. It steals the Keys to Lyoko from Aelita to have the means of escaping from the Supercomputer and to access the world network. Inside, X.A.N.A. uses its multi-agent system to infect hundreds of other supercomputers to exist outside of Lyoko and create Replikas inside each one for the power to take over secret bases on Earth, repurposed to use machinery or possessed scientists to create weapons, technology, and robot armies to conquer the world. Upon its escape, X.A.N.A. becomes more ruthless and aggressive, now targeting the virtual world itself to render them powerless against it (succeeded at the end of the third season, but was recreated after) and possessing William to make him its weapon. X.A.N.A. also targets Franz Hopper, the biggest threat and is the reason why the group keeps surviving. Near the end of the series, the group manage to free William and although it succeeded in killing Franz Hopper in the final battle, X.A.N.A. and all of its Replikas are destroyed by the multi-agent antivirus created by Jeremy before it can put its plans for conquest into action. Monsters :There are many types of monsters that X.A.N.A. virtualizes on Lyoko to fight, guard Towers, or attack important targets. The monsters generally appear to be organic/mechanical creatures based on various animals and insects. X.A.N.A.'s monster types include Kankrelats, Hornets, Bloks, Krabs, Megatanks, Tarantulas, Creepers, and Mantas. These monsters can be destroyed by hitting the Eye of X.A.N.A. on their bodies. In the Digital Sea, it uses monsters such as Kongres, Sharks, and the Kalamar. It also created the Scyphozoa, which it uses to steal data, drain energy, or brainwash warriors. There is also its ultimate monster, the Kolossus, which appeared in the last three episodes and is fueled by the combined power of its network Replikas. = Recurring characters = Elisabeth \\"Sissi\\" Delmas :Voiced by: Carole Baillien (French); Christine Flowers and Jodi Forrest (English) :The principal's daughter and a Kadic student. She is a mean, spoiled, conceited, but also beautiful and somewhat popular girl who has had a huge crush on Ulrich since before attending Kadic. Sissi and Odd quite often make fun of each other, with Odd making clever comebacks whenever Sissi says something rude or whenever they need her to go away. After Aelita is first materialized, she often does the same. Sissi tends to make fun of and openly insult Yumi in particular, mostly due to Ulrich liking Yumi more than her. Sissi is often followed by Herb and Nicolas, whom she often shows resentment towards, but uses them to her advantage anyway. She was initially part of the gang and knew about Lyoko, but was kicked out after breaking her oath to keep the Supercomputer a secret. She becomes friends with the Lyoko Warriors at the end of the series. Her memories of Lyoko were subsequently erased. Sissi also shows a dislike for her full name, Elisabeth, often making sounds of disgust when it's mentioned. Herb Pichon (French: Herv√© Pichon) :Voiced by: Bruno Mullenaerts (French); David Gasman (English) :An eighth-grader at Kadic and a classmate to the Lyoko Warriors. He is the second-in-command of Sissi's gang, and sometimes even the boss in times of emergency when Sissi proves to be incompetent, as he is the most intelligent member of their group. Herb is also shown to be in love with Sissi, although he doesn't tell her because of her crushes on various boys, most notably Ulrich. He is the second-best student in his class after Jeremy and the two often compete with each other, but Herb is almost always the loser. Herb is also shown to be easily scared off, quick to run away when something troubling happens. Nicolas Poliakoff :Voiced by: Carole Baillien (French); Matthew G√©czy (English) :An eighth-grader at Kadic. He is the third member of Sissi's gang. He usually does not show much intelligence, which is commonly conveyed through his frequent use of pauses and uhs in speech. He usually only does things when Sissi orders him to, and will otherwise not do much on his own. Nicolas also has also been shown to have a crush on Aelita, although he never acts on it. He can play the drums, and was in the Pop Rock Progressives, a band started by Odd. He is generally more tolerant of and less rude toward the Lyoko Warriors than Herb and Sissi are. In some episodes, it is shown that he has at least some degree of intelligence, as he wrote a script for a performance of Romeo and Juliet. Nicolas is also shown to be as easily frightened as Herb is. Jean-Pierre Delmas :Voiced by: Bruno Mullenaerts (French); Allan Wenger (English) :The principal of Kadic Academy, who is easily controlled by his daughter Sissi. He can be stubborn and incredibly ignorant at times, especially when members of the Lyoko Warriors are trying to convince him of any dangerous activity caused by X.A.N.A.. His appearance is based on Hayao Miyazaki. Jim Morales (French: Jim Moral√®s) :Voiced by: Fr√©d√©ric Meaux (French); David Gasman (English) :The physical education teacher at Kadic Academy and the chief disciplinarian. He is frequently mentioned to have had an extensive job history, although whenever it comes up, he almost always ends up dismissing it by saying, \\"I'd rather not talk about it.\\" Jim is often shown to digress from his lectures as he starts to reminisce on stories of his past, usually before being interrupted by someone or cutting himself off. On several occasions, Jim has discovered the existence of Lyoko or X.A.N.A. and displayed his helpfulness and willingness to keep it a secret, however, his memories are always erased through the use of a \\"Return to the Past.\\" One of his more notable secrets is that he once starred in a film called Paco, the King of Disco. Suzanne Hertz :Voiced by: Nathalie Stas (French); Jodi Forrest (English) :Usually referred to as Mrs. Hertz, she's a science teacher at Kadic. She is the most shown primary academics teacher in the series and appears to teach most branches of science at Kadic. She is also the only faculty member shown to organize field trips, which happens on several occasions. She has been shown to dislike or be disappointed in Odd and Ulrich, but takes a liking to Jeremy, and later Aelita. Milly Solovieff and Tamiya Diop :Milly voiced by: Mirabelle Kirkland (English) :Tamiya voiced by: Barbara Weber-Scaff (English) :The sole members of the Kadic News crew, who are both are in sixth grade and share a dorm room. Tamiya seems to be less driven by her emotions, which allows her to think more clearly than Milly when bad things happen to them. Hiroki Ishiyama :Voiced by: Barbara Weber-Scaff (English) :Yumi's younger brother. He is often shown pestering her about things and purposely being annoying, such as asking her to do his homework or mentioning her feelings for Ulrich. He is frequently shown playing on a handheld gaming device, and is often shown with his friend, Johnny. Hiroki has, on occasion, assisted Yumi when she needed it, although he usually requires some form of bribe. Takeho and Akiko Ishiyama :Takeho voiced by: David Gasman (English) :Akiko voiced by: Jodi Forrest (English) :The parents of Yumi and Hiroki. Takeho is shown to be a fairly typical semi-strict busy father and works for a local branch of a Japanese company. Akiko is depicted as a typical non-working housewife and is generally the first one to ask Yumi if something is wrong. When her parents appear in an episode, it usually focuses on Yumi's family issues. :It is implied that Takeho and Akiho have a low-key fractious relationship, with semi-frequent arguments that their children sometimes overhear. This seems to contribute to Yumi's reserve, and possibly, her reticence in pursuing a more serious emotional relationship with Ulrich. = Supporting characters = Franz Hopper :Voiced by: Mathieu Moreau (French); Paul Bandey (season 2), Alan Wenger (season 4) (English) :Full name Waldo Franz Schaeffer, he is the creator of both Lyoko and X.A.N.A., and was involved in the creation of Project Carthage. His wife Anthea was kidnapped by men in black suits and he was forced to flee with his young daughter Aelita. The two went to live in a house called the Hermitage, located in a park near Kadic Academy and the abandoned factory. While working as a science teacher at the school, he constructed the Supercomputer in the factory, and programmed X.A.N.A. and the virtual world of Lyoko within it. When the men in black suits tracked him down again, he took Aelita to the factory and virtualized her onto Lyoko with him, where he believed they would be safe. However, X.A.N.A. refused to obey its creator's orders or live in peace alongside Franz and his daughter. Franz was forced to shut the Supercomputer down until it was eventually discovered by Jeremy nearly ten years later. In one of the final episodes of the show, he sacrifices himself to allow Jeremy to finally defeat X.A.N.A.  Development  2001 original promotional poster for Garage Kids = Origins = Code Lyoko originates from the film short Les enfants font leur cin√©ma (\\"The children make their movies\\"), directed by Thomas Romain and produced by a group of students from Parisian visual arts school Gobelins School of the Image. Romain worked with Tania Palumbo, Stanislas Brunet, and Jerome Cottray to create the film, which was screened at the 2000 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. French animation company Antefilms offered Romain and Palumbo a contract as a result of the film. This led to the development of the pilot, Garage Kids. Garage Kids was first released in 2001. The project was created by Palumbo, Romain, and Carlo de Boutiny and developed by Anne de Galard. Its producers were Eric Garnet, Nicolas Atlan, Beno√Æt di Sabatino, and Christophe di Sabatino. The project was produced by Antefilms. Similar to its succeeding show Code Lyoko, Garage Kids was originally intended to be a 26-episode miniseries detailing the lives of four French boarding school students who discover the secret of the virtual world of Xanadu; created by a research group headed by a character known as the \\"Professor\\". The pilot featured both traditional animation and CGI. Garage Kids eventually evolved into Code Lyoko, which began broadcast in 2003 on France 3 and 2004 on Cartoon Network, with the virtual world renamed to \\"Lyoko.\\" Romain, however, left the show to work on the Japanese anime series ≈åban Star-Racers. The factory and boarding school are based on real locations in France. The factory was based on a Renault production plant in Boulogne-Billancourt, which has since been demolished. The school, Kadic Academy, is based on Lyc√©e Lakanal in Sceaux.  Broadcast  The series premiered on France 3 on 3 September 2003 and ended on 10 November 2007 in France. In the United States, the series premiered on 19 April 2004 on Cartoon Network. The second season started on 19 September 2005. The two-part XANA Awakens prequel aired on 2‚Äì3 October 2006, and the third season started a day later on 4 October 2006. The fourth and final season began on 18 May 2007. The last episode aired on Cartoon Network was \\"Cousins Once Removed\\", and the remaining seven episodes were released online at Cartoon Network video. When the series aired on Cartoon Network, it was simultaneously both part of its after-school weekday afternoon action animation lighter-toned programming block, Miguzi from 2004 to 2007, and also a standalone show on its primetime timeslot. The show aired on Kabillion from 2007 to 2015. The show also aired in Latin America and Japan on Jetix. In Italy, the show aired on Disney Channel and was published on DVD by Delta Pictures under the label 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. All four seasons were made available on Netflix on 6 August 2012, but was removed for unknown reasons. The series eventually returned to Netflix on 1 October 2020. Since 2015, all of the English dubbed episodes (including the prequel XANA Awakens) are currently viewable on YouTube. Since 2019, an upscaled HD version of the series is also available on Prime Video in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Reception and Accolades  The series received mostly positive reviews. Code Lyoko was voted as the best show by Canal J viewers in France, and has achieved international fame as well; the show has been rated as one of the best shows on Cartoon Network and Kabillion in the United States, with Cartoon Network having it rated as the #3 best performing show in 2006CL Presentation MIPTV 2012 2012-04-19. Retrieved 2012-04-19. and Kabillion having it as #4 in monthly average views in 2010. The show has reached success in Spain as one of Clan TVE's highest rated shows, on Italy's Rai2 network, and in Finland and the United Kingdom as well. The show also won France's Prix de l'Export 2006 Award for Animation in December 2006.  Merchandise  Several Code Lyoko products have been released, including DVDs, a series of cine-manga by Tokyopop, a series of four novels by Italian publisher Atlantyca Entertainment, apparel, and other accessories. In 2006, Marvel Toys released a line of Code Lyoko toys and action figures. When the series started to come to an end in 2007, The Game Factory released three video games based on the show: Code Lyoko and Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A. for the Nintendo DS, and Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity for the Wii, PSP, and PlayStation 2. The games were met with mixed to positive reviews from critics despite some criticisms of gameplay. There have been other games released through various mediums, one being Facebook. A series of Clan TVE festivals in Spain included live stage shows based on Code Lyoko among other things. A game show known as Code Lyoko Challenge was planned to be released in late 2012, but fell through. In January 2011, all four seasons of Code Lyoko were released on iTunes in the US and France by Moonscoop Holdings, although as of May 2019 only seasons 1 and 2 are available and other seasons have been removed. In October 2011, all four seasons were released on Amazon Instant Streaming and on DVD in the US, however, these DVDs are now out of print. In October 2020, Code Lyoko has been released on the streaming platform Netflix again after being taken down after the bankruptcy of MoonScoop in 2014. = Book series = A series of four chapter books was released by Atlantyca Entertainment and distributed in Italy and other countries. The novels delve deeper into the unanswered questions of the series. Taking place after the end of the series, X.A.N.A. has miraculously survived and returns though weakened and initially missing its memories. X.A.N.A. possesses Eva Skinner, an American girl, and travels to France in order to infiltrate the gang and kill them off. Unaware of their enemy's presence, the group works to find clues about Aelita's past, left by her father Franz Hopper, and confirm whether or not her mother is still alive somewhere. But at the same time, a terrorist group, the Green Phoenix, has become interested in the supercomputer and intend to use both it and the virtual world of Lyoko for evil purposes. It was confirmed that the series will never be released officially in English, nor the final two books released in French. However, sometime later, a fan community came together and sought to not only finish the series but translate it into more languages, including English. They have since completed their work and made it available for free download in September 2014.

Cunningham is the author of several books on Wicca and various other alternative religious subjects. His work Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, is one of the most successful books on Wicca ever published;\\"His books on Wicca led to a steady rise in his popularity, and he soon became one of the best-read Wiccan authors of his time. Sales of his most popular book Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (Llewellyn, 1988), reached over 400,000 copies by the year 2000\\" http://www.controverscial.com/Scott%20Cunningham.htm he was a friend of notable occultists and Wiccans such as Raymond Buckland, and was a member of the Serpent Stone Family, and received his Third Degree Initiation as a member of that coven. Early life Scott Cunningham was born at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, USA, the second son of Chester Grant Cunningham and Rose Marie Wilhoit Cunningham. The family moved to San Diego, California in the fall of 1959 due to Rose Marie's health problems. The doctors in Royal Oak declared the mild climate in San Diego ideal for her. Outside of many trips to Hawaii, Cunningham lived in San Diego all his life. Cunningham had one older brother, Greg, and a younger sister, Christine. Scott was openly homosexual for much of his life. He studied creative writing at San Diego State University, where he enrolled in 1978. After two years in the program, however, he had more published works than several of his professors and dropped out of the university to write full-time. During this period he had as a roommate, magical author Donald Michael Kraig and often socialized with witchcraft author Raymond Buckland, who was also living in San Diego at the time. Wicca In 1980 Cunningham began initiate training under Raven Grimassi and remained as a first-degree initiate until 1982 when he left the tradition to pursue a solo practice of witchcraft.Harvey, Graham, Listening People, Speaking Earth: Contemporary Paganism, Hurst, 1997, pp.50, 231 Cunningham practiced a fairly basic interpretation of Wicca, often worshiping alone, though his book series for solitaries describes several instances in which he worshiped with friends and teachers. He also believed that Wicca, which had been a closed tradition since the 1950s, should become more open to newcomers. Cunningham was also drawn to Huna and a range of new age movements and concepts that influenced and colored his spirituality.

Muslims wear a wide variety of clothing, which is influenced not only by religious considerations, but also practical, cultural, social, and political factors.http://guides.library.cornell.edu/IslamWomen/DressCode In modern times, some Muslims have adopted clothing based on Western traditions, while others wear modern forms of traditional Muslim dress, which over the centuries has typically included long, flowing garments. Besides its practical advantages in the climate of the Middle East, loose-fitting clothing is also generally regarded as conforming to Islamic teachings, which stipulate that body areas which are sexual in nature must be hidden from public view. Traditional dress for Muslim men has typically covered at least the head and the area between the waist and the knees, while traditional women's dress conceals the hair and the body from the ankles to the neck. Some Muslim women also cover their face. Islamic dress is influenced by two scriptural sources, the Quran and hadith. The Quran provides guiding principles believed to have come from God, while the body of hadith describes a human role model through the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The branch of fashion industry influenced by Islamic principles is known as Islamic fashion.  Hijab  The Arabic word hijab (ÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ®) translates into English as \\"veil\\". Adherents of Islam believe that it is a command by God to adult Muslim men and women, carrying the ruling of obligatory, which is agreed upon by consensus.http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2012/12/09/denying-the-obligation-of- wearing-hijab/http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2015/02/14/is-hijab-obligatory/ In addition, lowering the gaze and guarding one's chastity stand as vital aspects of wearing the hijab. The veil re-emerged as a topic of conversation in the 1990s when there was concern regarding potential western infiltration of Muslim practices in Islamic countries. The veil had a new purpose of shielding Muslim women from western influence. Some religious leaders reinforced the principle that an additional purpose of the hijab was to protect the Islamic people and customs. =Rules of hijab for men= According to the Qur'an, both men and women should dress in ways that are halal, meaning permissible, throughout their lives. According to the traditional view in Sunni Islam, men must cover from their belly buttons to their knees, though they differ on whether this includes covering the navel and knees or only what is between them.http://askimam.org/public/question_detail/16965http://seekershub.org/ans- blog/2014/05/26/covering-the-nakedness-for-a-man- answers/https://www.academia.edu/7434270/Maliki_Fiqh_Matn_al- Ashm%C4%81wiyyah_English_Translation_https://darululoomtt.net/awrah-men-imams- shafi-ahmad-malik-a-r/ It is also mentioned in the hadith that it is haram (prohibited) for men to wear clothing articles made of silk or animal skin that has not been tanned. Conversely, men are permitted to wear anything made of wool, camel hair, or goat hair. It is explicitly taught that men should not wear clothing that is see-through or that doesn't cover body parts that are considered intimate, known as ‚Äòawrah. Lastly, it is not halal for men to wear clothing that is similar to or imitates clothing that a woman would wear. =Rules of hijab for women= According to the traditional view in Sunni Islam, women must cover everything except their hands and faces; in the Hanafi school their feet may be exposed.http://seekershub.org/ans- blog/2010/09/19/a-detailed-exposition-of-the-fiqh-of-covering-ones-nakedness- awra/http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2016/04/11/can-you-clarify-the-standard- explanation-of-the-verse-of-hijab/ Hijab by country Female art students in Afghanistan. Bangladeshi women shopping at a department store in Comilla, Bangladesh. Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta The legal and cultural status of the hijab is different in different countries. Some have banned the wearing of all overt religious symbols, including the hijab (a Muslim headscarf, from the Arabic \\"to cover\\"), in public schools or universities or government buildings. = Austria = In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Austrian parliament. Additionally, on May 16, 2019, the Austrian parliament placed a ban on '‚Äúideologically or religiously influenced clothing which is associated with the covering of the head.‚Äù' This ban directly bans traditional headscarves worn by Muslim women worldwide. = Belgium = On 31 March 2010 the Belgian Chamber Committee on the Interior unanimously approved legislation instating a nationwide ban on wearing the burqa in public.Kamercommissie keurt verbod op dragen boerka's goed . De Morgen, 31 March 2010. The proposal was accepted by the Chamber of Representatives on 27 April 2010 with only two abstentions from Flemish Socialist MPs.Edward Cody. Belgian lawmakers vote to ban full-face veils in public. The Washington Post, 30 April 2010. = Bulgaria = In 2016, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Bulgarian parliament.Bulgaria the latest European country to ban the burqa and niqab in public places, Smh.com.au: accessed 5 December 2016. = France = In April 2011, France became the first European nation to ban face covering in public space. Balaclavas, face-covering niqabs, full-body burqas and carnival masks (outside carnival season) are prohibited,\\"Are prohibited, without being exhaustive, wearing balaclava,veils (burqa, niqab ...), masks or any other accessories or clothes that have the effect, in isolation or in combination with others, to hide the face\\". though hijab is permitted in public space, because it doesn't hide the face. The law was passed unanimously asserting that face-covering, including Muslim veils are contrary to the principles of security on which France is founded. Sharp criticism had accompanied France's nearly year-long debate on banning burqa-style veils, with those opposed saying, among other things, that the entire process has stigmatized the nation's estimated 5 million Muslims ‚Äì the largest Muslim population in western Europe. They also claim it is a political ploy because only an estimated 1,900 women wear veils that hide the face. = Latvia = In 2015 Latvia started debates to forbid face-covering clothing with proposed fines till 150 euro for covering face in public and till 350 euro for forcing someone to cover face in public. Government of Latvia agreed on the law only in 2017, and forwarded it to Saeima for final confirmation. Since 2018 process hasn't moved forward and law isn't confirmed and operational yet. There are almost no women in Latvia who cover their face and many have pointed out that such law would be redundant. = Netherlands = The Dutch government parliament in January 2012 enacted a ban on face-covering clothing, popularly described as the \\"burqa ban\\". Offenders can be fined up to 390 euro. The prohibition does not apply to face covering that is necessary for the health, safety or the exercise of a profession or practicing a sport. Excluded from the ban are also events such as Sinterklaas, Carnival, Halloween or when a mayor granted an exemption for a particular event. Also excluded from prohibition are places and buildings intended for religious purposes. The prohibition does not apply to passengers in airplanes and airports who are traveling through the Netherlands to their final destination. Kabinet akkoord met verbod gelaatsbedekkende kleding, Rijksoverheid. Retrieved 5 June 2012 = Turkey = Turkish women who want to wear the hijab ‚Äì the traditional Islamic headscarf covering the head and hair, but not the face ‚Äì to civil service jobs and government offices will be able to do so now that the Turkish government has relaxed its decades-long restriction on wearing the headscarf in state institutions. The new rules, which don't apply to workers in the military or judiciary, came into effect in 2013, and were put into place to address concerns that the restrictions on hijab were discouraging women from conservative backgrounds from seeking government jobs or higher education. \\"A dark time eventually comes to an end,\\" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech to the parliament. \\"Headscarf-wearing women are full members of the republic, as well as those who do not wear it.\\" = Syria = In 2011, Syrian President Bashar Assad reversed a decision that bans teachers from wearing the niqab. The move was seen as an attempt to appease Salafis as he faced down the uprising challenging his secular rule. As a symbol of political Islam, the government had banned the niqab in July 2010. Syria was the latest in a string of nations from Europe to the Middle East to weigh in on the niqab, perhaps the most visible symbol of fundamentalist Sunni Islam. = Pakistan = In Pakistan, the topic of the hijab is extraordinarily controversial. The veil is constantly a topic of debate and has been for decades now. The PewResearchCenter gathered information on several countries, including Pakistan, and came back with results on how people's perceptions of the veil differ across the world: \\"In Pakistan, there is an even split (31% vs. 32%) between woman #3 and woman #2, who is wearing a niqab that exposes only her eyes, while nearly a quarter (24%) choose woman #4.\\" The results show that there is still a lot of debate about what type of dress women perceive to be most appropriate, and it seems that the debate will continue to go on for many years to come. = Egypt = Reem, an Egyptian young lady wearing the Egyptian style of the Hijab, in 2010. On January 8, 2014, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey of Muslim women in various countries. An overwhelming eighty-nine percent of Egyptian women who responded to the survey believed that women should show their face in public. Ten percent of the survey participants believed that women should be fully veiled when in public. Compared to other countries, Egypt is not as conservative as others, but only fourteen percent of the women surveyed believed that Egyptian women should be able to choose their own clothing. Compared to six other countries, Egypt was last in this category; the statistic (eighty-four percent) suggests that Egyptian women (according to that single survey), do not believe that women should have freedom to choose their clothing. Meanwhile, in Egyptian media, women have always spoken about their freedom and right to wear whatever they want and that no one should be judged based on their outfits. = Saudi Arabia = Saudi Arabia is one of the few Muslim countries in which women are forced to cover in most parts of the country. While opinion surveys in Saudi Arabia suggests a strong belief that women should be covered, paradoxically there is also a strong belief that women should have the right to choose what they wear. A survey done in 2011 by the Pew Research Center asked women of different Muslim countries to choose which of several dresses they think are most appropriate for their country. Among Saudi women, 11% of women said a fully headed burqa is most appropriate, 63% of women said the niqab that only exposes the eyes is appropriate, only 8% said a black hijab covering the hair and ears is appropriate, 10% said a less conservative white hijab covering the hair and ears is appropriate, a small 5% said an even less conservative hijab that is brown and shows some hair is appropriate and a mere 3% said not wearing any covering was appropriate. The niqab is the dress that the highest percent of Saudi women felt was appropriate dress for women in Saudi Arabia. In accordance with these statistics, the Saudi woman that is used in the video, cited above, to show the popular view of Saudi women was wearing this niqab that only exposed her eyes. = Somalia = Somali women wearing the hijab. During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually wear the guntiino, a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. In more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac, which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the hijab and the jilbab is also commonly worn.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.117-118. = Hijab in the Americas =  United States  The Supreme Court of the United States ruled against an Abercrombie and Fitch dress policy that prohibited the job applicant Samantha Elauf from wearing a hijab.  Canada  In 2011, the Canadian government made it illegal for women to wear face- covering garments at citizenship ceremonies, because the judge must be able to see each person's face reciting their oath. In 2012, the Supreme Court issued a rare split decision on whether women could cover their faces on the witness stand. Four judges said it depended on the circumstances, two said witnesses should never cover their face, and one said a Muslim witness should never be ordered to remove her veil. Canada is considering a wider ban on veils in government offices, schools, and hospitals. The provincial government of French-speaking Quebec this year has proposed a law that would outlaw all religious regalia ‚Äî including Muslim scarves and veils, turbans, Jewish skullcaps and Christian crucifixes ‚Äî from state buildings.  South America  = Argentina = In 2011 Argentinian President Cristina Fern√°ndez pushed for legislation which allowed for Muslim women to wear hijab in public places. According to the new law Argentine Muslim women can wear a hijab while being photographed for their national id cards. The law was created in order to help promote freedom of religion and expression in the country, and help the Muslim population, which is estimated to be between 450,000 and one million, feel more integrated into society. = Chile = Chile has a minority Muslim population. Fuad Mussa, the President of the Islamic Cultural Centre, is quoted as saying that \\"there is a general ignorance among Chileans about Islam. This was after a Chilean citizen was refused service at a bank because of her Hijab in 2010, and would not be served until she removed her Hijab.  Muslim women's views on hijab  There are many different views of Muslim women regarding the hijab. Some(un)Veiled: Muslim Women Talk About Hijab. Directed by Ines Hofmann Kanna. Produced by Ines Hoffmann Kanna. Documentary Educational Resources (DER), 2007. Accessed 5 August 2016. http://search.alexanderstreet.com/view/work/764342 women believe that the hijab is too constraining but accept other Muslim women's donning of the garment; whereas other women are against both themselves and other women wearing the hijab due to its claimed oppressive nature. Furthermore, some women embrace the hijab as a way to celebrate their religion and feel that it helps them maintain their intellectuality rather than becoming a sex object in society. Some Muslim women wear the hijab because it has been part of their family tradition, and they do not want to give up something that is sacred to their family. There are women, who wear the hijab, who do not judge those that do not, and believe it is in all Muslim women\`s best interest to choose for themselves regarding whether they will don the veil or not. The subject is complex and layered, and below are a few anecdotes to provide real Muslim women's experiences with the hijab and their views. =Pro-hijab= Muslim women do not necessarily view the hijab as oppressive garment that is forced upon them as many westerners believe. Syima Aslam, a Muslim businesswoman from England, feels a special place for the hijab in her heart and feels that it directly connects her to Islam. Although she garners some disdain and disapproval of her choice to wear the hijab from some business partners, she stands firmly by her choice to don the hijab. Another young woman by the name of Rowaida Abdelaziz explains that the hijab is something that she has decided to wear herself and she \\"does not wear it because [she] is submissive\\". Another young woman by the name of Sarah Hekmati says that the hijab gives her a sense of freedom and that she likes the idea that a man should know a woman through her intellectual prowess rather than her looks. In her book, Do Muslim Women Need Saving?, Abu-Lughod mentions a former Muslim, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who wrote an autobiography titled Infidel. Hirsi Ali writes about the positive experience she has had living as Muslim and wearing the black garments and veil. Hirsi Ali says, \\"[the Islamic dress] had a thrill to it, a sensuous feeling. It made me feel empowered... I was unique [...] it made me feel like an individual. It sent out a message of superiority [...]\\". Hirsi Ali is among those who once supported the hijab. When she wore it, she did not feel oppressed, but instead empowered and individualized. There seems to be a trend of modern Muslim women standing up for their right to wear the hijab and a desire to show pride for Islam and to show their devotion to Islam in wearing the hijab, and expressing their positive sentiments regarding the hijab in the media. Hana Tajima, a Muslim fashion icon in her interview with Vision says that fashion-conscious Muslims are proving that you can be cool and modest, stylish and individual without compromising faith. She started her own fashion label Maysaa in 2011, and blogs about her far-reaching influences and inspirations. Twenty-six-year-old Tajima epitomises the new Muslim hipster, glamorous yet edgy, elegant yet quirky. The trend straddles the big cities of the world from London's Dalston to New York's Williamsburg - or the glitz of Dubai. =Anti-hijab= There are some Muslim women that believe that the hijab indeed hinders their personal freedom as a woman. A Muslim woman by the name of Rasmieyh Abdelnabi explains that she decided to stop wearing the hijab because she felt that it was putting too much pressure on her to \\"represent an entire community\\". She further explains that she feels that hijab is not representative of Islam but more so of the Arab culture.Hanzaee, Kambiz Heidarzadeh, and Shahrzad Chitsaz. \\"A review of influencing factors and constructs on the Iranian women‚Äôs Islamic fashion market.\\" Interdisciplinary Journal of Research in Business 1.4 (2011): 94-100. Another belief of some women that wear the hijab is that it could potentially \\"strip them of their individuality\\" and turn them into a figurehead for their religion. Some women do not want to have to deal with this on a daily basis, and it is another reason that some Muslim women decided to un-veil themselves. In an article written in September 2013, Nesrine Malike explains her discontent with being forced to wear the niqab, a kind of dress that only exposes the eyes, her whole life. Malike says, \\"I would rather no one wore a niqab. I would rather that no woman had effectively to disappear, from a young age, because that is the norm in her family. [...] I would rather that Islam be purged of the niqab and all its permutations.\\" Malike is among the Muslim women who feel as though the act of veiling hides women; she would like to ban the niqab from Islam. The former Muslim, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, wrote in her book Nomad about the veil: \\"(...) deliberately marks women as private and restricted property, nonpersons. The veil sets women apart from men and apart from the world; it restrains them, confines them, grooms them for docility. A mind can be cramped just as a body may be, and a Muslim veil blinkers and conditions both your vision and your destiny. It is the mark of a kind of apartheid, not the domination of a race but of a sex.\\" A recent incident in Germany reflects the extent of the issue on an international scale: \\"An administrative court in the southern German city of Munich has banned a female Muslim student from wearing a facial veil in class.\\" Although Germany does not have an official ban on the hijab, according to the nation's highest courts federal states have permission to ban Muslim state employees wearing clothing they deem inappropriate. This rule leaves flexibility for German legislators to essentially make their own rules concerning clothing/dress in the country. Iran is another country with strict rules on the hijab, and many women feel pressured from the government to dress in a certain style. One Iranian woman, Hengameh Golestan, decided to protest the Iranian government through her own artistic display. Islamic dress in Europe Muslim women by Islamic dress code, wearing hijab and niqab in Turkey. Islamic dress in Europe, notably the variety of headdresses worn by Muslim women, has become a prominent symbol of the presence of Islam in western Europe. In several countries the adherence to hijab (an Arabic noun meaning \\"to cover\\") has led to political controversies and proposals for a legal ban. The Netherlands government has decided to introduce a ban on face- covering clothing, popularly described as the \\"burqa ban\\", although it does not only apply to the Afghan-model burqa. Other countries, such as France and Australia are debating similar legislation, or have more limited prohibitions. Some of them apply only to face-covering clothing such as the burqa, chador, boushiya, or niqab; some apply to any clothing with an Islamic religious symbolism such as the khimar, a type of headscarf (some countries already have laws banning the wearing of masks in public, which can be applied to veils that conceal the face). The issue has different names in different countries, and \\"the veil\\" or \\"hijab\\" may be used as general terms for the debate, representing more than just the veil itself, or the concept of modesty embodied in hijab. Although the Balkans and Eastern Europe have indigenous Muslim populations, most Muslims in western Europe are members of immigrant communities. The issue of Islamic dress is linked with issues of migration and the position of Islam in western society. European Commissioner Franco Frattini said in November 2006, that he did not favour a ban on the burqa.Reformatorisch dagblad: Brussel tegen boerkaverbod , 30 November 2006. This is apparently the first official statement on the issue of prohibition of Islamic dress from the European Commission, the executive of the European Union. The reasons given for prohibition vary. Legal bans on face-covering clothing are often justified on security grounds, as an anti-terrorism measure.Dutch Consider Ban on Burqas in Public GREGORY CROUCH, New York Times (18 November 2006)Minister says burka is 'alien', prompting applause from Libs DEBBIE GUEST, JODIE MINUS, THE AUSTRALIAN, (APRIL 11, 2011) Ayaan Hirsi Ali sees Islam as incompatible with Western values, at least in its present form. She advocates the values of 'Enlightenment liberalism', including secularism and equality of women. For her, the burqa or chador are both a symbol of religious obscurantism and the oppression of women. Western Enlightenment values, in her view, require prohibition, regardless of whether a woman has freely chosen Islamic dress. Islamic dress is also seen as a symbol of the existence of parallel societies, and the failure of integration: in 2006 British Prime Minister Tony Blair described it as a \\"mark of separation\\".Blair's concerns over face veils BBC News Online. 17 October 2006. Visible symbols of a non-Christian culture conflict with the national identity in European states, which assumes a shared (non-religious) culture. Proposals for a ban may be linked to other related cultural prohibitions: the Dutch politician Geert Wilders proposed a ban on hijabs, in Islamic schools, in new mosques, and in non-western immigration. In France and Turkey, the emphasis is on the secular nature of the state, and the symbolic nature of the Islamic dress. In Turkey, bans apply at state institutions (courts, civil service) and in state-funded education. In 2004, France passed a law banning \\"symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation\\" (including hijab) in public primary schools, middle schools, and secondary schools,French MPs back headscarf ban BBC News (BBC). Retrieved on 13 February 2009. but this law does not concern universities (in French universities, applicable legislation grants students freedom of expression as long as public order is preserved). These bans also cover Islamic headscarves, which in some other countries are seen as less controversial, although law court staff in the Netherlands are also forbidden to wear Islamic headscarves on grounds of 'state neutrality'. An apparently less politicized argument is that in specific professions (teaching), a ban on \\"veils\\" (niqab) is justified, since face-to-face communication and eye contact is required. This argument has featured prominently in judgements in Britain and the Netherlands, after students or teachers were banned from wearing face-covering clothing. Public and political response to such prohibition proposals is complex, since by definition they mean that the government decides on individual clothing. Some non-Muslims, who would not be affected by a ban, see it as an issue of civil liberties, as a slippery slope leading to further restrictions on private life. A public opinion poll in London showed that 75 percent of Londoners support \\"the right of all persons to dress in accordance with their religious beliefs\\".Guardian: Livingstone decries vilification of Islam, 20 November 2006. In another poll in the United Kingdom by Ipsos MORI, 61 percent agreed that \\"Muslim women are segregating themselves\\" by wearing a veil, yet 77 percent thought they should have the right to wear it.Ipsos MORI Muslim Women Wearing Veils .

Since becoming an academy in 2010, the school is now sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, and accepts applications from any student wishing to board. Before 2010, only those students whose parents were serving or had served in the armed forces were eligible. With the transition to academy status, the school became a state boarding academy (and is both a member of the State Boarding Forum and Boarding Schools Association) and oversight transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Department for Education. Duke of York‚Äôs has many traditions and rich history, which includes ceremonial parades and uniforms, a monitorial style of education modelled on the English public school system. This rich history includes a long line of notable alumni, known as Dukies, including senior generals (such as Sir Archibald Nye, Gary Coward and David Mark Cullen), famous musicians (such as Henry Lazarus), sportsmen (like Maurice Colclough), many leading academic scientists (including Professors Paul Shaw, Timothy Foster and Mark Gardiner) and clergymen (James Jones and Bill Ind) and a long list of decorated armed forces personnel. History Founded in 1803 by act of Royal Warrant dating from 1801, the school was until 1892 called the Royal Military Asylum. The school‚Äôs primary purpose was to educate the orphans of British servicemen killed in the Napoleonic Wars of 1793-1815. Between 1803 and 1909 the Royal Military Asylum was located at what is now known as the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London. The school was co-educational; making the Duke of York's the second co-educational boarding school in the United Kingdom. The first co-educational institution was the Royal Hibernian Military School in Dublin, which was relocated and merged with Duke of York's after Ireland declared independence. Today the Chelsea site is home to the Saatchi Gallery. The school adopted the \\"Madras system of education\\" developed by Dr. Andrew Bell, to which Joseph Lancaster made certain improvements. In 1812, three African youths attended the school as teachers for several months thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Gloucester. They were then sent by the African Institution to Sierra Leone, where they were employed as teachers by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Earl of Liverpool. The school's original site in Chelsea. Between 1816 and 1840, the Asylum had a branch in Southampton which provided schooling for up to 400 military orphans and children of serving soldiers of both sexes until 1823, when the boys were transferred to Chelsea, with Southampton taking more girls. A decline in the school numbers resulted in its closure in 1840. From 1841, the buildings were taken over by the Ordnance Survey. One of the more notable Commandants of the Royal Military Asylum was Major General Peter Brown. A veteran of the Napoleonic Wars Brown was unusual in that he was promoted whilst in post (from colonel to major general), which was highly unusual given the post was not an active command and his predecessors and successors were never promoted in post. Many of the school's pupils carried acts of gallantry in the wars that the British Army was involved in. One such individual was John Shaul who was awarded the Victoria Cross for extraordinary bravery in the Boer War. In 1892, the Royal Military Asylum was renamed The Duke of York's Royal Military School and in the process became an all-boys school. In 1909, the school relocated to new premises constructed on the cliffs above Dover in Kent. For the duration of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), the school was evacuated to Hutton, near Brentwood, Essex. The reason for the evacuation was to provide the military authorities with a transit point in Dover for troops moved to and from the Western Front. In 1940 the school was evacuated to the Saunton Sands Hotel, Braunton, North Devon, returning to Dover in 1946. In 1994, the school re- admitted girls and returned to co-education. Academic standards Between 2007 and 2009 more than 90% of pupils gained 5 or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (including English and Mathematics). More than 13% of grades were A*/A during the same period. During this period (2007‚Äì2009) 19% of grades gained were A/B at AS level and 12% of grades were A/B at A2 level. A total of 32% of grades gained were passes at A2 level. Most recent results can be found on the School website. Sports facilities Pupils have access to extensive sporting facilities; indeed sports take place every day, with main sports like rugby and hockey being played twice per week. Pupils can also engage in sports and athletic training in their own time each day. The school has a strong sporting culture. The 150 acres (607,000 m2) of land on the school site includes a full size athletics track, two sports halls, swimming pool, indoor squash courts, gymnasium and a dozen full size grass pitches for rugby union, cricket and tennis. ¬£24.9 million was invested in the School's facilities in 2014, with a Sports Hall designed to Sports England specification being added to the site to enhance its already impressive facilities. Exchanges with NATO member military schools The Duke of York's runs exchange programmes with military schools within NATO. Of these the most notable is the programme run with the school's French equivalent, the Lyc√©e Militaire in Aix-en-Provence. There are also placements for recent school leavers from respective military schools to assume teaching assistant posts at corresponding schools. The Duke of York's also maintains connections with Missouri Military Academy, Valley Forge Military Academy and College, Wayne, Pennsylvania, and Faujdarhat Cadet College, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Parading, military instruction, adventurous training Ceremonial Parades take place on some Sunday mornings; the grandest of these being on Remembrance Sunday and the Grand Day at the end of summer term. On Parade, as well as for all military activities, pupils are called cadets and are organised into ceremonial Guards or they play an instrument in the Band. Cadets wear the standard dark blue ceremonial uniform of the British Army. The Duke of York‚Äôs Royal Military School Ceremonial Band is the largest within and since 2010 outside the Ministry of Defence, being larger still than the Massed Bands of the Foot Guards of the Household Division. The considerable number of notable musicians educated at the school over the last 207 years demonstrates the very high standards in music tuition. In recent years the band has performed at: * Twickenham Stadium (for the annual rugby match between the Royal Navy and British Army) * Lord's (for International Test Match Cricket) * Chatham Historic Dockyard (Armed Forces Day), alongside The Band of HM Royal Marines * Aldershot (for the Army Rugby League Finals). The school employs a regimental sergeant major to co-ordinate ceremonial drill and military instruction. All pupils are cadets, with ranks ranging from cadet to senior under officer, and entrance to the armed forces at all ranks - as either a ranking soldier or commissioned officer entrant ‚Äì occurs regularly. Adventurous training is run by the school and is available to senior school pupils. Each training camp is completed on Dartmoor at Oakhampton Training Camp and lasts one week, comprising mostly field-craft and endurance skills; but always including an extended exercise. High table High table is where a member of the senior leadership team, two sixth form prefects and other students (taken from each house in rotation) and guests take luncheon. The table is waited on. Guests are invited from the officers' messes of nearby Army battalions, Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force squadrons. Members of the school's board of governors, some of whom are senior military officers and leaders in business and commerce, are also invited regularly. Boarding houses The school is currently divided into twelve Houses, nine of which are named after famous British generals, one after a famous admiral of the Royal Navy, another after a famous marshal of the Royal Air Force: =Junior houses (year 7)= * Nelson * Trenchard =Senior houses (years 8-11)= * Haig * Kitchener * Roberts * Wolseley * Wellington * Clive * Wolfe * Marlborough * Alanbrooke =Years 12-13= * Centenary House (opened in September 2010) Refurbishment In 2014, a ¬£25m refurbishment of school premises was completed including a new sports hall, upgrading of the main hall into a performing arts centre, two new teaching wings and four new residential houses along with the upgrading of the existing ones. Pupil capacity was increased by over 50%. Music Music plays an important role in the life of the school. The school has several music ensembles of varying size, predominantly featuring military band instruments. The school's marching band has performed at public events such as the Chatham Dockyard Remembrance Day Parade and has been a regular pre-match feature at the Army vs Navy rugby match at Twickenham for many years. In addition to the concerts and military band engagements that are held throughout the year, the school choir has featured in local television and radio broadcasts with their special version of \\"Wherever You Are\\", a song by the composer Paul Mealor which was performed by the Military Wives Choir at the 2011 Festival of Remembrance. The Duke of York's School version featured a pupil of the school reading a letter to her father who served in Afghanistan over Christmas 2011 and was broadcast on the Chris Evans BBC Radio 2 breakfast show on Wednesday 14 December and repeated several times in full on BBC Radio Kent throughout the Christmas period. The YouTube video of the Duke of York's School averaged 1000 hits a day during the weeks leading up to Christmas. Marching beats * Regimental Colour - the School has its own \\"stand of Colours\\". The School Colour is trooped at many Parades. * School Quick March: Sons Of The Brave * School Slow March: The Duke Of York * School Song: \\"Play Up Dukies\\" * School Hymn: \\"Sons of the Brave\\" * School March off: \\"Marchin' through Georgia\\" Military colours Along with Eton College and Cheltenham College, the Duke of York's Royal Military School is one of only three English schools to have military colours. While Eton and Cheltenham parade their colours on rare occasions, the Duke of York's Royal Military School parades its colours briefly as the Parade enters Chapel, and on a number of ceremonial parades in the course of the year. The colours are of Marron and Dark Blue and can be found in the Head Man's office while not on parade or in Chapel. Chapel and war memorials Despite pupils having multi- faith backgrounds, the school adheres to the practices of the Church of England. Chapel is taken 3 times a week, by pupils, including a full church service on Sunday. Sunday services are preceded by a parade including the whole school; the school regularly invites notable people from the military to be the inspecting officers on Sunday Parades. Consequently, cadets go to church services in chapel wearing their ceremonial uniforms. On days of special religious significance, the Chapel follows High Church traditions. The walls of the chapel are laid up with the battle honours belonging to former Cadets' regiments and corps; but of more note are the historic carved marble tablet lists of the hundreds of Dukies who have sacrificed their lives in Great Britain's various wars and conflicts since 1803. The school has a memorial to the Great War and the Second World War placed just inside of the ex-main entrance to the school. The parade and band pay its respects here on the Armistice Commemoration. A great number of former pupils, many of them in the armed forces, also attend, along with Dukies who are now Chelsea pensioners. Guards' competition and Grand Day At the end of each summer term the school parades for Grand Day. This is a special parade of much greater complexity, and is similar in style and length to the Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards. The purpose of Grand Day is to display the school at its finest to a visiting dignitary, who is either a member of the Royal Family or a member of the British armed forces General Staff. Grand Day has its origins in the school parading before its founder, the then Prince Frederick Duke of York and Albany when the school was founded in 1803. In the build-up toward Grand Day the Guards (each corresponding to boarding houses) undergo the Guards' Competition, nicknamed \\"Drill Comp\\". The purpose is to test skill at ceremonial drill and standards regarding kit turnout. The outcome of the Guards' Competition ranks the Guards' Order of Precedence for Grand Day. The winning and therefore senior Guard is referred to as Number One Guard, with the others in declining order. Old Dukie, the late Sir John Carter, organised a visit to the School by Lady Margaret Thatcher. George Pooley of Pooley Swords donated a sword called the Thatcher Sword of Honour which is granted to the best performing Guard Officer each year. Performing arts Performing Arts at the Duke of York's Royal Military School has developed and produced several international semi-professional musical production, with a partnership school in West Point, Virginia. The international productions take place every two years with the first production 'Cabaret' 2014 and more recently Phantom of the Opera 2016. Many other productions and performances are produced during the year. Ever other year a smaller scale musical is produced with this years production being Hairspray. A range of other productions such as the annual dance festival and Grand Day production are great showcases to show what the school has to offer in the art form. Bi-centenary and new colours The School celebrated its bi-centenary in 2001‚Äì02. It held a commemorative service at Christmas in 2001 as well as a special parade at the end of 2003, when it received new colours from Prince Andrew Duke of York. The school celebrated the centenary of its move to Dover in 2009 and amongst many special events hosted a reception at the House of Lords, as well as parades and drama productions. A change in traditions Until 1999 the School's headmasters were all serving military officers of the rank of at least lieutenant colonel. Since then there have been four civilian headmasters. The school also has a regimental sergeant major among its staff whose primary role is to co-ordinate military standards and drill discipline. The school's first civilian students were accepted in 2010 after the school was granted academy status. Prior to this, the school had taken only students whose parents were veterans or currently serving in the United Kingdom's military forces. Notable alumni Alumni are known as \\"Dukies\\". * Lieutenant-General Sir Gary Coward ret'd, CB, OBE, beginning his career in the Royal Artillery before transferring to the Army Air Corps, Coward was Quarter-Master General of the British Armed Forces, formerly Chief of Staff of the Permanent Joint Headquarters and before that General Officer Commanding United Kingdom Joint Helicopter Command.

He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Canada Research Chair in Political Philosophy at Queen's University at Kingston, and Recurrent Visiting Professor in the Nationalism Studies program at the Central European University in Budapest, Hungary. For over 20 years, he has lived a vegan lifestyle, and he is married to the Canadian author and animal rights activist Sue Donaldson.Will Kymlicka's home page, where he discloses that he is married to co-author Sue Donaldson. Academia Kymlicka received his B.A. (Honours) in philosophy and political studies from Queen's University in 1984, and his D.Phil. in philosophy from Oxford University in 1987, under the direction of G. A. Cohen. He has written extensively on multiculturalism and political philosophy, and several of his books have been translated into other languages. Kymlicka has held professorships at a variety of different universities in Canada and abroad, and has also worked as an advisor to the Government of Canada.\\"Biography\\", Will Kymlicka's Homepage. Accessed 17 February 2011. Thought One of his main concerns throughout his work is providing a liberal framework for the just treatment of minority groups, which he divides into two basic categories: polyethnic or immigrant groups, and national minorities (such as the Canadian Qu√©b√©cois, or the MƒÅori of New Zealand). He lists criteria for national minorities or \\"minority nations\\": # present at founding; # prior history of self-government; # common culture; # common language; # governing selves through institutions. By these criteria, the two \\"minority nations\\" in Canada are the First Nations population and the Qu√©b√©cois. Kymlicka argues that such minority groups deserve unique rights from the state by the nature of their unique role and history within the national population. Polyethnic groups are less deserving of such rights since they come to the state voluntarily and thus have some degree of responsibility to integrate to the norms of their new nation. This does not mean that they are not entitled to any rights as Kymlicka argues that all cultural minorities have a right to choose their own lives, but it does mean that they are not entitled to the same level of group rights which minority nations would be entitled to. Kymlicka makes various exceptions such as the problems faced by refugees, whether from conflict or poverty, and by such minority groups such as African-Americans (whose heritage in America clearly did not begin voluntarily) and argues that their needs with regards to cultural group-specific rights should be considered on a special basis. In Multicultural Citizenship (1995), Kymlicka argues that group- specific rights are consistent with liberalism, and are particularly appropriate, if not outright demanded, in certain situations. He defines three such group-specific rights: special group representation rights (such as affirmative action policies in politics); self-government rights; and polyethnic rights (such as the policy exempting Sikhs from having to wear motorcycle helmets). A distinction that Kymlicka draws, which is crucial to his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between external protection and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified in order to promote equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in apartheid in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person's autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities. Brian Barry argues that Kymlicka‚Äôs views are not liberal at all, in the sense that they are not universalist in nature and that they allow for cultural relativism. Barry further accuses Kymlicka of posing a false choice between liberalism as autonomy and liberalism as tolerance, further asserting that claims for cultural rights and for equality of treatment are incompatible.Brian Barry, Culture and Equality (Polity Press, 2001) Young Kim provides an interesting comparison of their two views on multiculturalism and the limits of liberalism.Young Kim, Justice as Right Actions: An Original Theory of Justice in Conversation with Major Contemporary Accounts (Lexington Books, 2015, ). =Human rights= The standard liberal criticism, which states that group rights are problematic because they often treat individuals as mere carriers of group identities, rather than autonomous social agents, is overstated or oversimplified. The actual problem of minorities and how they should be viewed in liberal democracies is much more complex. There is a distinction between good group rights, bad group rights, and intolerable group rights. # Bad group rights (internal restrictions) are rules imposed by the group upon intragroup relations. They most often take the form of the group restricting the liberty of individual members in the name of group solidarity. Indigenous groups try to protect themselves from women's movements on the basis that they threaten the social and traditional role of indigenous populations. He contends that may raises the danger of individual oppression. Internal restrictions can be used to uphold violent, dominant, absolutist systems. Legally-imposed internal restrictions are thus bad and almost always unjust, not to mention that they go against liberal ideals. # Good group rights (external protections) involve intergroup relations. Indigenous groups need protection in terms of their nationals identities by limiting the vulnerability of that group to the decisions of external groups or society. Therefore, they should have the right to their own taxation, health care, education, and governance. =Animal rights= The book Zoopolis, by Sue Donaldson and co-authored with Kymlicka, explores the state of animal rights for different categories of animals. Donaldson and Kymlicka believe that abolitionism is an inadequate response to both the ethical and practical challenges of living fairly and constructively with other animals. Donaldson and Kymlicka suggest that animals should be characterized through three categories, serving to determine the nature of the laws and politics that should protect those animals. Domesticated animals should be given a kind of adjusted co-citizenship in which their best interest and preferences would be taken into account. Donaldson and Kymlicka defend the end of their use, advocating for a vegan position, but they reject extinctionism with regards to those animals that are currently breed by humans. Wild animals should be granted sovereignty on their land enough so that they can sustain their way of living and prosper. Donaldson and Kymlicka support some moderate forms of intervention to reduce wild animal suffering, and they claim that more significant courses of action should be aiming at keeping wild animals able to lead their lives. \\"Liminal\\" animals, those that are not domesticated but live in urban, suburban, or industrial areas (such as mice, pigeons and insects), should be treated as denizens of human communities.Donaldson, Sue and Kymlicka, Will, 2011.

As Canterbury Laureate from July 2009 to December 2010, Agbabi received an Arts Council grant to write a full-length poetry collection based on Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,Patience Agbabi, \\"About\\", Telling Tales website. and her next book, 2014's Telling Tales, mines the Middle-English masterwork to offer a 21st-century take on the characters, its poetry and its performance elements.\\"from Telling Tales Prologue (Grime Mix)\\", The Poetry Society, 2014. The book met with praise from poets including Simon Armitage, who described it as \\"the liveliest versions of Chaucer you're likely to read.\\" Agbabi continues to tour Telling Tales as a performance-poetry production shown at literature festivals, arts spaces and libraries across the UK. She has performed extensively and collaborated with other writers. Her work has also been influenced by rap rhythms and wordplay. She was a member of Atomic Lip, which has been described as \\"poetry's first pop group\\". They worked together from 1995 to 1998 and their last tour, Quadrophonix (1998) merged live and video performance. In 1996 she worked on a performance piece called FO(U)R WOMEN, with Adeola Agbebiyi and Dorothea Smartt, first performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and which toured from 1995 to 1998.Stephanie Everett, \\"Patience Agbabi\\", Aesthetica. As well as performing in Britain, Agbabi has undertaken British Council reading tours of Namibia, the Czech Republic, Zimbabwe, Germany and Switzerland. She took part in Modern Love, a spoken-word tour produced by Renaissance One, which explored love and modern relationships, touring the UK and Switzerland. Her poetry has been featured on television and radio, including the Channel 4 series Litpop in 1998 and on the children's programme Blue Peter in 1999. She has also been a contributor to several anthologies, among them Jubilee Lines (2012), edited by Carol Ann Duffy), which marked Queen Elizabeth II's 60th anniversary on the throne,Anna Aslanyan, \\"Jubilee Lines: British poets mark queen's 60th year on throne\\", The National, 2 June 2012. and Refugee Tales (2016), a collection of stories based on accounts by Gatwick airport detainees.Alison Flood, \\"Canterbury Tales rebooted with refugee stories of trafficking and detention\\", The Guardian, 13 June 2016.Jess Denham, \\"Refugee Tales: Modern reboot of The Canterbury Tales to tell harrowing refugee stories\\", The Independent, 14 June 2016.

Keyes wrote fifteen books on personal growth and social consciousness issues, representing about four million copies distributed overall. Early life =Childhood and adolescence= Keyes was born an only child to an affluent family in Atlanta. Throughout their lives, he was close to his father and especially to his mother, despite her eventual abuse of alcohol. He suffered from chronic bronchitis and croup in his infant years, and in 1925 his family moved to Miami Beach, Florida in hopes of his benefiting from its sunny climate. His father, Kenneth Keyes Sr., became successful in real estate development there and active in the conservative evangelical wing of the Presbyterian Church.Concern v. Concerned TIME magazine, October 13, 1967. Accessed April 12, 2007. Keyes was not very athletic as a child, but excelled in academics and developed hobbies, such as photography. When he was in high school, his father bought him a small boat, which began his lifelong interest in sailing. Keyes attributed the seeds of the personal growth system he would later develop to an experience he had with a stern English teacher in ninth grade. Despite her reputation as a strict teacher and hard grader, he made an effort to be personally caring toward her, which led to her giving him a slight break in grading. He took the lesson from this experience to be \\"that when I express caring and friendliness, they are reflected back to me in life.\\" =College, military service, and a new family= Keyes entered Duke University in 1938 and spent two years there. He then studied voice and music at the University of Miami, and helped to found the Miami Opera Guild. In 1941, during the World War II era, Keyes enlisted in a naval intelligence unit set up to censor cablegrams entering and leaving the United States. At age of 20, Keyes met his first wife, Roberta Rymer, at the University of Miami. They were married in December 1941, a few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their first child, Ken III, was born in December 1942, and their second child, Clara Lu, was born in April 1944. Keyes was discharged from the service in October 1945, and entered the real estate business with his father. When he was around 23, he photographed and filmed Alfred Korzybski at the Institute of General Semantics, helping to document Korzybski's life. Apparently he was already greatly involved in the logical aspects of self- help. =Polio and quadriplegia= In February 1946, at age 25, Keyes contracted polio and became paralyzed in his legs and hands. His paralysis developed into quadriplegia and was sufficiently severe that, for example, he was unable to turn himself over in bed. He was admitted to the Warm Springs Foundation, a convalescent hospital in Georgia. After a year in the hospital, he moved with his wife to a nearby house for three more years of rehabilitation, during which time he adjusted to life as a wheelchair user. He invented a switch-activated powered bed that would turn his body over. He said he \\"began to develop the feeling that I did not have to be so totally dependent on other people\\" and \\"still wanted to feel that I was a capable and lovable person.\\" To that end, he obtained a lever-controlled electric wheelchair, a new invention at the time. Keyes required aides for bodily care for several decades. =First book= According to Keyes, he became involved in many activities to overcome the feeling of dependence and uselessness brought on by his disability. He wrote a book on mental techniques for increasing effectiveness in daily life. This book, entitled How to Develop Your Thinking Ability, was published by McGraw-Hill in 1950 and contained illustrations by cartoonist Ted Key. Keyes later reacquired the publishing rights to the book and re-released it as Taming Your Mind. In a subsequent book, Discovering The Secrets of Happiness, Keyes commented, about this period of his life, that his disability may have been a disguised blessing: > \\"Perhaps I would have been so caught up in the business and social rat race > that I wouldn't have sat still long enough to study my security, sensation > and power illusions ‚Äî and then discover how to deal with them so I could > open up my heart to loving more. My reality is that I am far too busy and > involved in my life activities to have time to concern myself with self- > consciousness in the wheelchair department. Today I view my so-called > 'handicap' as another gift my life has offered me.\\" =Life after polio therapy= Upon completion of therapy in 1949, Keyes returned to South Miami, Florida where he resumed work in real estate and bought a specially equipped speedboat for racing. By 1950, Keyes was the general manager of a radio station owned by his father, and started his own commercial real estate business. Completing his schooling, he received a B.A. in psychology from the University of Miami. He planned and built a series of personal residences, and in 1956 bought a 71-foot yacht, the Caprice, capable of serving as a floating residence. =Divorce and remarriage= Over these years, Keyes indicates that he and his wife were drifting apart, and he had affairs with other women. He and Rymer separated and then divorced in 1959, after eighteen years of marriage. He received the yacht in the property settlement and moved his residence and office there. His second book, on the topic of nutrition and entitled, How to Live Longer-Stronger-Slimmer (later to be retitled, Loving Your Body), was published by Fredrick Fell during this period. Around 1964, Keyes resumed working for his father in a real estate company targeted at foreign investors. At age 44, he met and married his second wife, Bonita, who was sixteen years his junior. During this period he wrote his third book with Jacque Fresco, a book on futurism entitled Looking Forward. According to Keyes, his wife Bonita's jealousy and depression became major stumbling blocks in their relationship, and Keyes would later fault himself for what he describes as his unskilled responses to these issues. Keyes and Bonita divorced after a year of marriage, and Keyes grieved the loss of the relationship. In 1968 Keyes established a national commercial real estate sales operation, with revenues of $25 million during its first year of operation. He maintained romantic relationships with various women, and would later comment that his sexual appetite had been an impediment to his personal growth. Spirituality and personal growth In 1970, just before his 50th birthday, Keyes traveled to the Esalen Institute in California and enrolled in two workshops there. He then returned to Florida, became involved with the Humanistic Psychology Association and was exposed to teachings such as those of Chogyam Trungpa and Alan Watts. He also experimented briefly with mescaline, which, he reported, induced in him a continuously orgasmic experience he found distasteful. He credited this experience with allowing him to begin overcoming his obsession with sex, although he would remain sexually active throughout his life. Keyes lived for a few months with two students who had been influenced by Trungpa and Ram Dass. He traveled with them to a commune and a Trappist monastery in Virginia and a spiritual center in Connecticut. A turning point came for Keyes when he visited Trungpa at his center in Barnet, Vermont at Christmas 1970 and discussed with Trungpa the Buddhist notion that the mind's reaction rather than external circumstances creates personal unhappiness. Keyes has said that he felt this to be the solution to the life problems he had experienced. Over the next year, Keyes lived with a small group of people on his yacht, and prepared to turn his business over to an employee and found a nonprofit organization with his other assets. At this time he had a brief experience he described as transcendent, \\"like the pure energy of God--radiant, indescribable--and I felt a part of it all.\\" According to Keyes, during this period he used his new learning to cope more successfully with issues of jealousy and deception in his romantic relationship with a woman named Jane. During an episode in which Jane brought another lover onto his yacht, he used a form of mental reprogramming process that, he says, alleviated his jealously without repressing it, a method he would later teach. During this time he formulated the \\"Twelve Pathways\\", which would constitute the core of his \\"Living Love\\" method of personal growth. Within a month he had drafted the core of a new book, Handbook to Higher Consciousness. This self-published book sold more than one million copies. Living Love years =Going west, and the Living Love Center in Berkeley= In mid-1972, Keyes outfitted a bus for living, sold his yacht, disposed of most of his possessions, and began traveling west with a group of other people, visiting places such as Taos, New Mexico and the Rainbow Gathering at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He traveled for about a year, and while traveling began holding sessions using the Living Love methods. Keyes gave his first formal workshop on the Living Love methods at the Esalen Institute. He settled in Berkeley, California in 1973 and began giving regular workshops, establishing the Living Love Center there in June 1973 in a former fraternity house. The workshops were attended by as many as fifty people at a time. Keyes recruited a staff from the streets of Berkeley at essentially volunteer wages to support the workshops, which he also began giving in Los Angeles. At this time the Handbook to Higher Consciousness was selling about fifty thousand copies a year, and his workshops attracted students from all over the country. In 1974 Keyes banned drug use from the Center. He wrote more books and they began to sell rapidly. His staff, which included Shakti Gawain, Tolly Burkan, and Summer Raven, worked on the workshops and activities such as writing songs to go along with them. =Cornucopia in Kentucky= Having outgrown the Berkeley center, in mid-1977 the organization bought a 150-acre (607,000 m2) property in St. Mary, Kentucky that had been a Catholic seminary. The organization moved to the new property, which it renamed \\"Cornucopia.\\" Soon after the move, conflict developed between Keyes and the organization's head administrator and training director, Carole Thompson. Keyes had hired her in Berkeley, but, he said, he later thought she was influencing the staff in unhelpful directions. According to Keyes, she refused to allocate staff to him for the workshops he led, and he felt she was trying to edge him out of teaching and into the financial side of the operation. Similar \\"power moves\\" occurred during the Berkeley years, inevitable byproducts of a growing organization. Ken dealt openly with these issues using methods that he taught to keep the organization and vision on track. The week-long retreats during this time without Ken included such things as eating vegetarian meals, doing \\"karma yoga\\" work (chores) around the grounds, daily workshops based on The Handbook to Higher Consciousness principles, and watching the Franco Zeffirelli film, Brother Sun, Sister Moon, about the life of St. Francis of Assisi. These practices had been a part of daily life at the Berkeley house and all residents participated. The goals were to expose participants to teamwork and health consciousness while supporting day-to-day organizational functions. One of the more interesting exercises, also practiced in Berkeley, occurred when participants randomly selected a partner (done by forming two circles, one inside the other, with the outer circle moving clockwise, and until the leader said \\"stop\\" forcing people to choose diametrically opposite partners). A four-foot piece of cord was given to each \\"couple,\\" and each was told to tie one end to his or her wrist. Thus, partners were literally tied together for the next 24 hours. It was a complication to use the bathroom, especially if one's partner was of the opposite sex. The purpose of the exercise was that partners had to work together and communicate in order to go anywhere or do anything. Adding to the \\"we are all brothers and sisters\\" theme was the fact that all the bathrooms and showers at Cornucopia were co-ed. Additionally, near the end of the workshop, all people participated in an exercise requiring them to take off all their clothes, stand before the group naked, and share honestly what they did not like about their body. Some had no problem with the exercise and for others it proved quite challenging to be able to let go of all the negative opinions many held regarding their own body images. =\\"On retreat\\" in Santa Cruz= In March 1978, with six other people, Keyes left Cornucopia in the administrator's charge and moved back to Santa Cruz, California, a move he later characterized as an unskillful withdrawal from the problem. He characterized the level of teaching quality at Cornucopia after his departure as lowered and uneven. Debts at Cornucopia began to increase. On a visit back to Cornucopia in November 1978, Keyes became involved with Penny Hannig, an acquaintance of several years and a worker at the center, and she joined him in Santa Cruz in 1979. She became his third wife in September 1984. Keyes remained in Santa Cruz for three years. He describes this period of his life as being \\"on retreat.\\" During these years, the couple \\"lived in a pattern of voluntary simplicity.\\" He received Social Security disability benefits and received room, board, medical care, and a vacation from the organization, but he took no salary and received no royalties from his books. He received an inheritance from his mother's estate, most of which he donated to the organization. He continued to write books, some of which Penny co-wrote. Penny cared for his physical needs, and they were quite close, remaining in each other's company almost continually. Bouts of depression and hostility Penny experienced over a period of about two years during this time were initially mysterious, but the couple eventually diagnosed these symptoms as being the result of food allergies. After a change in her diet, the symptoms were brought under control. =Coos Bay, Oregon, and the Ken Keyes College= In 1982, the leader with whom Keyes had clashed left Cornucopia, taking much of the staff with her. The organization sold the Cornucopia property and relocated along with Keyes to Coos Bay, Oregon, in an old four-story hospital building. They chose Coos Bay because it was said to be a place least likely to be attacked in a nuclear war. There they continued to give workshops and write books for about four years, before deciding to open a formal training school for the Living Love method, which they called the Ken Keyes College. The first enrolled group numbered almost a hundred. In 1982 Keyes published The Hundredth Monkey, a book about how to prevent nuclear war. Late in 1986, during the college's first nine-month training course, Keyes developed pneumonia. He was admitted to the hospital and eventually put on a respirator. He credited his use of the Living Love methods with enabling him to summon the strength and serenity to remain calm and upbeat about his situation and to visualize healing for his lungs. Although there had initially been some doubt about his physical viability, he was able to come off the respirator and breathe again on his own. He left the hospital and resumed training the inaugural group of students at the college, who graduated in May 1987. With international lawyer Benjamin Ferencz, Keyes wrote another book on world politics, PlanetHood. Final years Keyes and Penny eventually were divorced and the Ken Keyes College closed. In 1990, Keyes began studying inner-child healing and the rapid-eye-movement therapy developed by Francine Shapiro. He established the Caring Rapid Healing Center in Coos Bay to do private multi-day counseling workshops in this area, and wrote his final book, Your Road Map to Lifelong Happiness, on these topics. Keyes married a fourth wife, Lydia, who survived him. He died of kidney failure in 1995. He was also survived by his children, Ken Keyes III and Clara Hardin. Influence and legacy In his life Keyes sold or distributed millions of books, lectured to many people, spoke to dignitaries at political gatherings, and knew and moved among the self-help elite, including Wayne Dyer, who said that Keyes \\"literally got me started on this glorious transformational journey.\\" His books are still available thirteen years after his death, and a small group of his students maintain ties and carry on his methods. However, Keyes' organization essentially died with him. Keyes employed no explicit strategies to ensure his organization would continue or grow without him, and he did nothing that would promote any established organization or personal legacy. He focused, instead, on teaching his methods. He never sought out a major publisher for his books, but self-published them all, and even brought back in-house one book that had been placed with a major publisher. Of the three teaching centers he founded, only the last was eponymous.

With more than 10,000 artifacts, the museum is the largest archive of Olympic Games in the world and one of Lausanne's prime tourist site draws attracting more than 250,000 visitors each year. The Olympic Museum and the Olympic Park (sculpture garden between the museum and Lake L√©man) are located at Ouchy, south of Lausanne. The headquarters of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are located at Vidy, to the west of Ouchy.  History  The museum was founded on 23 June 1993, on the initiative of then-president of the IOC Juan Antonio Samaranch. Mexican architect Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez, an International Olympic Committee member, and Jean-Pierre Cahen, were in charge of the project. The museum was named the European Museum of the Year in 1995. After 23 months of renovation between 2012 and 2013, the Olympic Museum re-opened on 21 December 2013. During the transformations of the building, a temporary exhibition was set up in a boat (Helv√©tie) of the CGN, in front of the Olympic Park. With the renovation, the surface of the museum increased from 2,000 m2 (in 2011) to 3,000 m2 (in 2013) . Exhibits Entrance to the Olympic Spirit Exhibit The permanent exhibition is organized into three major themes on three separate floors: Olympic World, Olympic Games, and Olympic Spirit. A visit begins on the third floor, where the Olympic World part of the exhibition informs visitors of the history of the ancient Olympic Games and the rebirth of the modern Games in the 19th century. Highlights include a display of Olympic torches, as well as a video documenting major moments in the history of opening ceremonies history. The second floor focuses on Olympic Games. Sporting equipment for a variety of sports are on display, and visitors are introduced to the Youth Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. More than 1,000 video clips of Olympic Games events and athletes can be searched and viewed at individual viewing stations. The final part of the permanent exhibit covers the Olympic Spirit, where visitors are made to feel part of an Olympic Village and can test their balance, agility, and mental skills with interactive exercises. Olympic medals are also on display. The renovated museum also includes a temporary exhibit space, where the museum regularly hosts traveling exhibits.

The highest-ranking defendant was the former Waffen-SS general Sepp Dietrich. Malmedy massacre Victims of the Malmedy massacre were preserved under the snow until Allied forces recaptured the area in January 1945. The Malmedy massacre was a series of killings committed by members of Kampfgruppe Peiper, part of the 1st SS Panzer Division, against American prisoners of war and Belgian civilians during the Battle of the Bulge. Although the killing of over 80 American POWs near Baugnez was the primary subject of the eventual trial, it was only one of a series of war crimes committed by Kampfgruppe Peiper between mid-December 1944 and mid-January 1945.Malmedy massacre Investigation‚ÄìReport of the Subcommittee of Committee on Armed Services. United States Senate Eighty-first Congress, first session, pursuant to S. res. 42, Investigation of action of Army with Respect to Trial of Persons Responsible for the Massacre of American Soldiers, Battle of the Bulge, near Malmedy, Belgium, December 1944. 13 October 1949. In total, over 750 POWs were murdered, mostly executed at close range by gunshots to the head (though the eventual U.S. Senate investigation would tally the official total at 362 POWs and 111 civilians). Most of the testimony provided by the survivors stated that about 120 Americans from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion (FAOB), were surprised by the German armored advance on Baugnez, and surrendered. They were then gathered in a field near the Baugnez crossroads, at which time the SS troops fired on their prisoners with machine guns. Several SS prisoners later testified that a few of the prisoners had tried to escape. Others claimed that a few of the prisoners had recovered their previously discarded weapons and fired on the German troops as they continued their progress toward Ligneuville.Wholesale Slaughter at Baugnez-lez-Malmedy, Willy D. Alenus Of the 84 bodies recovered a month later, most showed wounds to the head, seemingly much more consistent with a deliberate massacre than with self-defense or with injuries inflicted on prisoners who were attempting to escape. As soon as the SS machine gunners opened fire, the American POWs panicked. Some tried to flee, but most were shot where they stood. A few sought shelter in a caf√© at the crossroads. The SS soldiers set fire to the building, and shot all who tried to escape the flames. Some in the field had dropped to the ground and pretended to be dead when the shooting began. However, SS troops walked among the bodies and shot any who appeared to be alive. On January 13, 1945, American forces secured the areas where the killings occurred. The bodies were recovered on January 14 and January 15, 1945, with the cold weather preserving the evidence and keeping the bodies and their wounds mostly intact. The autopsies revealed that at least twenty of the victims had suffered fatal gunshot wounds to the head, inflicted at very close range. These were in addition to wounds made by automatic weapons. Another 20 showed evidence of small-calibre gunshot wounds to the head without powder- burn residue; 10 had fatal crushing or blunt-trauma injuries, most likely from rifle butts. Some bodies showed a single wound, in the temple or behind the ear.Roger Martin, L'Affaire Peiper, Dagorno, 1994, p. 76 Most of the bodies were found in a very small area, suggesting the victims had been gathered just before they were killed. Trial proceedings Joachim Peiper and interpreter at Malmedy Trials 1946 The trial ‚Äì Case Number 6-24 (US vs. Valentin Bersin et al.) ‚Äì was one of the Dachau Trials, which took place from May 16, 1946 to July 16, 1946. The defendants appeared before a military court of senior American commissioned officers. The defendants were 73 former members of the Waffen-SS, mostly from the SS Division Leibstandarte. Highest in rank were SS- Oberst-Gruppenf√ºhrer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the 6th Panzer Army, his chief of staff, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Fritz Kr√§mer, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Hermann Priess, commander of the I SS Panzer Corps and SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Joachim Peiper, commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment - the core element of Kampfgruppe Peiper, which conducted the massacre. The counts of indictment related to the massacre of more than three hundred American prisoners of war \\"in the vicinity of Malmedy, Honsfeld, B√ºllingen, Ligneuville, Stoumont, La Gleize, Cheneux, Petit Thier, Trois Ponts, Stavelot, Wanne and Lutrebois\\", between December 16, 1944 and January 13, 1945 during the Battle of the Bulge, as well as the massacre of about one hundred Belgian civilians in the vicinity of Stavelot.

Everett Jr., a lawyer from Atlanta, assisted by other American and German lawyers. The prosecution was led by Colonel Burton L Ellis. Six defendants, including Peiper, complained to the court that they had been victims of physical violence or threats of violence meant to force them to provide extrajudicial confessions. The defendants were invited to confirm the statements they had made under oath. Of the nine who testified, three had claimed mistreatment they had suffered.Malmedy massacre Investigation ‚Äì Report of the Subcommittee of Committee on armed services ‚Äì United States Senate ‚Äì Eighty-first Congress, first session, pursuant to S. res. 42, Investigation of action of army with respect to trial of persons responsible for the massacre of American soldiers, battle of the Bulge, near Malmedy, Belgium, December 1944. October 13, 1949 p. 27 For most of the accused, the defense argued that they either had not participated, or had done so by obeying a superior's orders. The court ruled that all but one of the defendants were guilty in some degree. Forty-three were sentenced to death, including Peiper; the rest were sentenced to from ten years to life in prison. Dietrich received a life sentence and Priess 20 years imprisonment. Verdicts On July 16, 1946 the verdict was delivered on 73 members of the Kampfgruppe Peiper. * 43 sentenced to death by hanging, including Peiper * 22 sentenced to life imprisonment * 2 sentenced to 20 years imprisonment * 1 sentenced to 15 years * 5 sentenced to 10 years =Review procedure= Pursuant to procedure, an in-house review was undertaken by the American Occupation Army in Germany; the trial was carefully examined by a deputy judge. Taking into account doubts which surrounded the investigation phase, he issued in several cases recommendations of free pardon or commutation of the death sentences, which were often followed by General Lucius Clay, the Commander of the American zone in occupied Germany. =Other appeals= Colonel Everett was convinced that a fair trial had not been granted to the defendants: in addition to alleged mock trials, he claimed that \\"to extort confessions, U.S. prosecution teams 'had kept the German defendants in dark, solitary confinement at near starvation rations up to six months; had applied various forms of torture, including the driving of burning matches under the prisoners' fingernails; had administered beatings which resulted in broken jaws and arms and permanently injured testicles'.\\"Clemency, Time magazine, Jan. 17, 1949 . Approximately sixteen months after the end of the trial, almost all the defendants presented affidavits repudiating their former confessions and alleging aggravated duress of all types.Malmedy massacre Investigation, p. 4 =The Simpson Commission= The turmoil raised by this case caused the Secretary of the Army, Kenneth Royall, to create a commission chaired by Judge Gordon A. Simpson of Texas to investigate. Apparently, the Commission was interested not only in the facts of the Malmedy massacre trial, but also had to deal with other cases judged by the International Military Tribunals in Europe. The commission supported Everett's accusations regarding mock trials and neither disputed nor denied his charges of torture of the defendants. The Commission expressed the opinion that the pre-trial investigation had not been properly conducted and that the members felt that no death sentence should be executed where such a doubt existed.Malmedy massacre Investigation, p. 28 One of the members of the commission, Judge Edward L. Van Roden of Pennsylvania, made several public statements alleging that physical violence had been inflicted on the accused. Furthermore, under his signature, an article denouncing the conditions under which the assumed guilt of Malmedy defendants and of other questionable cases was going to be published in February 1949 with the assistance of the National Council for Prevention of War.American atrocities in Germany, by Judge Edward L. Van Roden, The Progressive, f√©vrier 1949. He refused to commute the six remaining death sentences, including Peiper's, but the executions were postponed. =The Senate subcommittee= Eventually, the United States Senate decided to investigate. Ultimately, the case was entrusted to the Committee on Armed Services over the Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. The investigation was entrusted to a subcommittee of three senators chaired by Raymond E. Baldwin. The subcommittee was set up on March 29, 1949. Its members went to Germany and during its hearings, the commission heard from no fewer than 108 witnesses. Joseph McCarthy had obtained from the subcommittee's chairman authorization to attend the hearings. McCarthy's state, Wisconsin, had a large population of German heritage, spurring allegations that McCarthy was politically motivated in his work on behalf of the Malmedy defendants.The Politics of Fear: Joseph R. McCarthy and the Senate, Robert Griffith, University of Massachusetts Press, 1987, p. 22 He used an aggressive questioning style during the proceedings.The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy, Fred J. Cook, Random House, 1971, p. 133 McCarthy's actions further inflamed a split between the American Legion, which took a hardline position after Malmedy and generally supported upholding the death sentences, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who supported more lenient penalties for the Waffen-SS members under Peiper.Bitburg in moral and political perspective, Geoffrey H. Hartman, Indiana University Press, 1986 at pp. 68-73. The last clash took place in May 1949 when he asked that Lieutenant Perl to be given a lie detection test. Since this had been rejected by Baldwin, McCarthy left the session claiming that Baldwin was trying to whitewash the American military.The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy, cit√© ci-dessus, p. 133 While on the one hand McCarthy was far from impartial, two of the members of the three-man subcommittee, the chairman Senator Raymond Baldwin and Senator Lester Hunt have been accused by historian David Oshinsky of being \\"determined to exonerate the Army at all costs\\".\\"Throughout the hearings, McCarthy bullied witnesses, made scores of erroneous statements, exaggerated his evidence, and turned almost every session into a barroom brawl. At the same time, however, he demonstrated that Baldwin and Hunt were no more interested in an impartial investigation than he was. Their manners were better, their tone more subdued, but they were determined to exonerate the Army at all costs, just as Joe was determined to prove its culpability.\\" David M. Oshinsky \\"A conspiracy so immense: the world of Joe McCarthy\\" pp. 76-77 Oshinsky also alleges that the third member of the committee, Senator Estes Kefauver, displayed a lack of interest in the case, attending only two of the first fifteen hearings.David M. Oshinsky \\"A conspiracy so immense: the world of Joe McCarthy\\" pp.76 McCarthy sought to denounce Baldwin in front of the whole Senate, but his efforts were repudiated by the Commission on Armed Forces, which clearly showed its support for Baldwin and eventually adopted the report of the subcommittee. =The subcommittee report= In its report, the subcommittee rejected the most serious charges, including beatings, torture, mock executions and starvation of the defendants. In addition, the subcommittee determined that commutations of sentences pronounced by General Clay had occurred because of the U.S. Army's recognition that procedural irregularities could have occurred during the trial. The commission did not exonerate the defendants or absolve them of guilt and it endorsed the conclusions General Clay issued in the particular case of Lieutenant Christ. In summary, Clay had written that \\"he was personally convinced of the culpability of Lieutenant Christ and, that for this reason his death sentence was fully justified. But, to apply this sentence would be equivalent accepting a bad administration of justice, which led [him], not without reserve, to commute the death penalty to life imprisonment\\".Malmedy massacre Investigation, p. 31 See also * Nuremberg Trials * Biscari Massacre References Further reading * Steven P.

Its presence in a television image is a telltale sign that 1) the signal is broadcast digitally, as this type of error can not occur in analog transmission, and 2) that there is a significant amount of noise, as digital television is designed to tolerate a certain amount of interference. Block errors are usually detected, but not corrected, by the receiving device and are commonly displayed as empty black boxes in the television image. Because of how television images are usually compressed, a block error in a single frame often results in black boxes in several subsequent frames. In the worst case, a few block errors per frame could render the video from a television broadcast unviewable. Block errors are most common in digital satellite television, where bad weather or motion of the satellite dish can cause interference outside the broadcaster's control. Block errors can occur at levels of interference where an analog transmission would be fuzzy but still viewable. Thus, block errors are a fine example of the consequences of trade offs in engineering.

New York World-Telegram In 1965, a large part of Brooklyn Heights was protected from unchecked development by the creation of the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, the first such district in New York City. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Directly across the East River from Manhattan and connected to it by subways and regular ferry service, Brooklyn Heights is also easily accessible from Downtown Brooklyn.

The New York City Fire Department operates two fire stations near Brooklyn Heights: Engine Company 205/Ladder Company 118 at 74 Middagh Street, and Engine Company 224 at 274 Hicks Street. History =Early settlement= Brooklyn Heights occupies a plateau on a high bluff that rises sharply from the river's edge and gradually recedes on the landward side. Before the Dutch settled on Long Island in the middle of the seventeenth century, this promontory was called Ihpetonga (\\"the high sandy bank\\") by the native Lenape American Indians. The view of New York City from Brooklyn Heights, (1778-c.1880) Brooklyn Heights in 1854 Ferries across the East River were running as early as 1642, serving the farms in the area. The most significant of the ferries went between the current Fulton Street and Peck Slip in Manhattan, and was run by Cornelius Dirksen. The ferry service helped the lowland area to thrive, with both farms and some factories along the water, but the higher ground was sparsely used. The area was heavily fortified prior to the Battle of Long Island in the American Revolutionary War. After British troops landed on Long Island and advanced towards Continental Army lines, General George Washington withdrew his troops here after heavy losses, but was able to make a skillful retreat across the East River to Manhattan without the loss of any troops or his remaining supplies. After the war, the 160-acre tract of land belonging to John Rapeljie, who was a Loyalist, was confiscated and sold to the Sands brothers, who tried to develop the part of the land on the palisade as a community they called \\"Olympia\\", but failed to make it come about, partly because of the difficulty of building there. They later sold part of their land to John Jackson, who created the Vinegar Hill community, much of which later became the Brooklyn Navy Yard.Manbeck (2008), pp.99-102 =Development= Brooklyn Heights began to develop once Robert Fulton's New York and Brooklyn Steam Ferry Boat Company began regularly scheduled steam ferry service in 1814, with the financial backing of Hezekiah Beers Pierrepont, one of the area's major landowners. Pierrepont had accumulated 60 acres of land, including 800 feet which directly overlooked the harbor, all of which he planned to sub-divide. Since his intention was to sell to merchants and bankers who lived in Manhattan, he needed easy access between Brooklyn Heights and New York City, which Fulton's company provided.Burroughs & Wallace (1999), pp.450-51 Pierrepont bought - part of the Livingston estate, plus the Benson, De Bevoise and Reemsen farmsRizzo, Joanna. \\"Pierrepont: Seeing great potential across the river in Brooklyn\\" The Real Deal (July 30, 2008) - on what was then called \\"Clover Hill\\", now Brooklyn Heights, and built a mansion there. Pierrepont purchased and expanded Philip Livingston's gin distillery on the East River at what is now Joralemon Street, where he produced Anchor Gin. Wishing to sub-divide and develop his property, Pierrepont realized the need for regularly scheduled ferry service across the East River, and to this end he became a prominent investor in Robert Fulton's New York and Brooklyn Steam Ferry Boat Company, using his influence on Fulton's behalf; he eventually became a part owner and a director of the company. Fulton's ferry began running in 1814, and Brooklyn received a charter as a village from the state of New York in 1816, thanks to the influence of Pierrepont and other prominent landowners. The city then prepared for the establishment of a street grid, although there were competing plans for the size of the lots. John and Jacob Hicks, who also owned property on Brooklyn Heights, north of Pierrepont's, favored smaller lots, as they were pitching their land to tradesman and artisans already living in Brooklyn, not attempting to lure merchants and bankers from Manhattan as Pierrepont was. To counter the Hickses' proposal, Pierrepont hired a surveyor and submitted an alternative. In the end, the Hickses' plan was adopted north of Clark Street, and Pierrepont's, featuring 25-by-100 foot (8-by-30 meter) lots, south of it. Thanks to the influence of Pierrepont and other landowners, Brooklyn received a charter from the state as a village in 1816, which led to streets being laid out in a regular grid pattern, sidewalks being laid, water pumps being installed and the institution of a watch. After 1823, farms begin to be sub- divided into lots, which were advertised as suitable for a \\"country retreat\\" for Manhattanites, leading to a building boom that resulted in Brooklyn Heights becoming the \\"first commuter suburb\\", since it was easier and faster to get to Manhattan by ferry than it was to commute from upper Manhattan by ground transportation. A resident of the Heights could leave the office at three o'clock, have dinner at home at four o'clock, and still have time for a \\"leisurely drive to the outskirts of town\\", a \\"middle class paradise\\".Burroughs & Wallace (1999), p.972 The community's development was helped by the yellow fever epidemic of 1822, when many of the rich from the city abandoned it for an area that was advertised as \\"elevated and perfectly healthy at all seasons ... a select neighborhood and circle of society.\\" Where there had been only seven houses in the Heights in 1807, by 1860 there were over six hundred of them,Manbeck (2008), pp.95-99 and by 1890 the area was almost completely developed. The buildings were designed in a wide variety of styles; development started in the northern part, and moved southward, so the architecture general changes in that direction as the preferred style of the time changed over the decades. Throughout the 19th century, Brooklyn Heights remained an elegant neighborhood, and became Brooklyn's cultural and financial center. Its development gave rise to offshoots such as Cobble Hill and, later, Carroll Gardens.Burroughs & Wallace (1999), p.933 Prior to the Civil War, Brooklyn Heights was a locus of the Abolitionist movement, due to the speeches and activities of Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church, now the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims. Beecher was a nationally known figure famous on the lecture circuit for his novel oratorical style, in which he employed humor, dialect, and slang. Under Beecher, so many slaves passed through Plymouth Church on their way to freedom in Canada that later generations have referred to the church as the \\"Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad\\". To dramatize the plight of those held in captivity, Beecher once brought a female slave to the church and held an auction, with the highest bidder purchasing not the slave, but her freedom. Beecher also raised money to buy other slaves out of captivity, and shipped rifles to abolitionists in Kansas and Nebraska in crates labelled \\"Bibles\\", which gave the rifles the nickname \\"Beecher's Bibles\\"., pp.34-39 The Brooklyn Heights Promenade =20th century= The completion of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, the Brooklyn end of which was near Brooklyn Heights' eastern boundary, began the process of making the neighborhood more accessible from places such as Manhattan. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s Lexington Avenue subway line, which reached Brooklyn Heights in 1908, was an even more powerful catalyst in the neighborhood's development. The resulting ease of transportation into the neighborhood and the perceived loss of the specialness and \\"quality\\" began to drive out the merchants and patricians who lived there; in time their mansions were divided to become apartment houses and boarding houses. Artists began to move into the neighborhood, as well as writers, and a number of large hotels ‚Äì the St. George (1885), the Margaret (1889), the Bossert (1909), Leverich Towers (1928), and the Pierrepont (1928), among others ‚Äì were constructed. By the beginning of the Great Depression, most of the middle class had left the area. Boarding houses had become rooming houses, and the neighborhood began to have the appearance of a slum. During the 1940s and 1950s, the building of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) badly affected the neighborhood, as it took away the neighborhood's northwest corner, destroying whole rows of brownstones. At about the same time, plans began to be developed by New York's \\"master builder\\", Robert Moses, wielding the Housing Act of 1949, to replace brownstone rowhouses ‚Äì which were the typical building form in the neighborhood ‚Äì with large luxury apartment buildings. A prominent example of the intended outcome is the Cadman Plaza development of housing cooperatives in the northern part of the neighborhood, located on the site where the Brooklyn Bridge trolley terminal once stood. In 1959, the North Heights Community Group was formed to oppose destroying cheap low-rise housing in order to build the high-rise Cadman Plaza towers. Architect Percival Goodman presented an alternate plan to maintain all sound structures, which garnered 25,000 supporters. In early 1961, a compromise proposal came from City Hall calling for two 22-story towers with over 1,200 luxury and middle income units. The Brooklyn Heights Association fully supported the compromise plan despite strong opposition from the preservation community, including the North Heights Community Group. As a result, 1,200 residents were removed from their houses and apartments in late 1961 and early 1962 as construction began on the modified plan.Salzman, Lorna. \\"Brooklyn Heights Blows It,\\" Brooklyn Rail (July‚ÄìAugust 2015), pp.28-29Osman, Suleiman. (2011) The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn: Gentrification and the Search for Authenticity in Postwar New York New York: Oxford University Press. p.150 One positive development came about when community groups - prominently the Brooklyn Heights Association, founded in 1910 - joined with Moses in the creation of the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, also called the Esplanade, which was cantilevered over the BQE. It became a favorite spot among locals, offering magnificent vistas of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline across the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, and spectacular fireworks displays over the East River. Moses originally proposed to build the BQE through the heart of Brooklyn Heights. Opposition to this plan led to the re-routing of the expressway to the side of the bluff, allowing creation of the Promenade.Krogius, Henrik. The Brooklyn Heights Promenade Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2011. By the mid-1950s, a new generation of property owners had begun moving into the Heights, pioneering the \\"Brownstone Revival\\" by buying and renovating pre-Civil War period houses, which became part of the preservationist movement which culminated in the passage in 1965 of the Landmarks Preservation Law.See Schneider, Martin L. Battling for Brooklyn Heights: The Fight for New York's First Historic District Brooklyn, New York: Brooklyn Heights Press, 2010; and Schneider, Martin L. and Junkersfeld, Karl. \\"Brooklyn Is My Neighborhood: The Story of New York‚Äôs First Historic District\\" (video) Brooklyn, New York: Brooklyn Heights Press, 2010 In 1965, community groups which later became the Brooklyn Heights Association, succeeded in having the neighborhood designated the Brooklyn Heights Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the first such district in the city. This was followed in the following decades by the further gentrification of the neighborhood into a firmly middle-class area, which became \\"one of New York City's most pleasant and attractive neighborhoods.\\" The Brooklyn Historical Society, 128 Pierrepont Street on the corner of Clinton Street, founded by Henry Pierrepont in 1863 as the \\"Long Island Historical Society\\". The building was constructed in 1878-81 and was designed by George B. Post =21st century= Starting in 2008, Brooklyn Bridge Park was built along the shoreline of the East River. the park was 90% complete. The Squibb Park Bridge was constructed in 2013 to provide access between the park and the rest of Brooklyn Heights, but had to be demolished in 2019 due to various structural issues. Architecture and places of interest Brooklyn Heights was the first neighborhood protected by the 1965 Landmarks Preservation Law of New York City. The neighborhood is largely composed of blocks of picturesque rowhouses and a few mansions. A great range of architectural styles is represented, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Victorian Gothic, Romanesque, Neo-Grec, and Classical Revival, as well as a few 2/1/2-story late Federal houses from the early 19th century in the northern part of the neighborhood., pp.230-235 Some houses were constructed of brick, but the dominant building material was brownstone or \\"Jersey freestone\\", a reddish-brown stone from Passaic County, New Jersey. A typical brownstone rowhouse was three or four stories tall, with the main floor above the street level and reached by stairs, referred to as a \\"stoop\\", a word derived from Dutch. The basement is typically a half-flight down from the street, and was used as the work area for servants, including the kitchen. The first floor would be the location of the public rooms, bedrooms were on the second floor, and servants' quarters were on the top floor. The rear of the lot would feature a private garden. Aside from rowhouses, a number of houses, particularly along Pierrepont Street and Pierrepont Place, are authentic mansions. The concentration of over 600 pre-Civil War houses, one of the largest ensembles of such housing in the nation, and the human scale of the three, four- and five-story buildings creates a neighborly atmosphere. Brooklyn Heights has very few high-rise buildings. Among these buildings are 75 Livingston Street, Hotel St. George, and the Concord Village co-op development on Adams Street. Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses had its world headquarters in the northern part of Brooklyn Heights at 25 Columbia Heights. The organization restored a number of historic buildings to house their staff, including the former Hotel Bossert, once the seasonal home of many Dodgers players, on Montague Street. In 2010, the organization announced plans to begin selling off its numerous properties in the Heights and nearby downtown Brooklyn, given that it plans to relocate itself in upstate New York. The executive offices of the Brooklyn Dodgers were, for many years, located in the Heights, near the intersection of Montague and Court Streets. A plaque on the office building that replaced the Dodgers' old headquarters at 215 Montague Street identifies it as the site where Jackie Robinson signed his major league contract. Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims and Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Catholic Cathedral are located in Brooklyn Heights, as are the First Unitarian Congregational Society, the Long Island Historical Society, Packer Collegiate Institute, and St. Ann's and the Holy Trinity Church, among other historically notable buildings.

The former Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) Brooklyn Heights branch at 280 Cadman Plaza West, now demolished = Libraries = The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)'s Brooklyn Heights branch is located at 109 Remsen Street. The branch was formerly located at 280 Cadman Plaza West, which was shared with the Business & Career Library, but that site was sold to a developer and demolished.

The city would restore the proper names, and Middagh would put back her own signs. Several iterations of this game ended when Middagh's new names were given official status by a resolution of the alderman. In Historically Speaking, Brooklyn borough historian John B. Manbeck says only that these street names \\"have questionable origins,\\" as does Love Lane, which reputedly gets its name from the meetings that took place there between a pretty girl who lived nearby and her suitors.

After becoming Prince of Chu, he was a known supporter of many religions. In particular, his sponsorship of Buddhism in 65 CE is the first documented case of Buddhist practices in China. See also Z√ºrcher 1972, p. 26. Born to the Lady Xu (), a junior consort of Emperor Guangwu, Liu Ying was given the rank of duke in 39 CE, and prince (w√°ng) in 41 CE. The next year he received Chu as his hereditary fiefdom, with his capital at Pengcheng (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). The young Liu Ying seems to have been close to his half-brother Liu Zhuang, the future Emperor Ming. He is also said to have travelled widely and gained an interest in Huang-Lao Daoism () and Buddhism (, literally \\"Buddha\\"). After Liu Ying became a prince, he actively supported both religions in the hope of finding a drug of longevity or immortality. Because of these activities, Liu Ying was suspected of treasonous intrigue and the subject of an imperial edict from Emperor Ming. The edict, which survives in the Book of the Later Han shows that at the time the Buddha was associated in the opinion of the Chinese imperial court with Daoism. He was treated like a god to whom sacrifices and fastings were held. Buddhism was described as \\"humane\\" and generally accepted by the elite. Citing Liu Ying's support of Daoism and Buddhism, Henri Maspero noted, \\"It is a very curious fact that, throughout the whole Han dynasty, Taoism and Buddhism were constantly confused and appeared as a single religion.\\"Henri Maspero, 1981, Taoism and Chinese Religion, tr. by Frank A. Kierman Jr., University of Massachusetts Press, p. 405. Five years later, in 70, Liu Ying's activities were again denounced by high officials and he was accused of plotting against the throne, a crime punishable by death. Among his supposed crimes was the most heinous of those in Han law: usurping the prerogatives of the emperor, and great improprietry and immorality in his conduct toward the throne (). Nevertheless, Emperor Ming refused to execute Liu Ying, instead demoting him to the rank of a commoner and exiling him to Danyang in the lower Yangtze. Liu Ying committed suicide upon reaching his destination the next year. He was buried with the honours of a full marquess (). As part of the purges following Liu Ying's downfall, thousands of his supposed adherents were arrested and implicated each other under torture. Nevertheless, the Buddhist community at Pengcheng survived. More than a century later, it was still thriving under the patronage of Ze Rong, a native of Danyang.

Also containing substantial amounts of molybdenum, gold and other rare metals. It is also a settlement, enumerated at Iranian census. The Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex is located 65 km southwest of Kerman and 50 km south of Rafsanjan. The region's altitude averages about 2600m, the highest spot of which approximates 3000m. Sarcheshmeh ore bodies, situated in the central part of Zagros ranges, consist of folded and faulted early tertiary volcano-sedimentary rocks. Sar Cheshmeh mine was managed by the Anaconda Group until the 1979 revolution in Iran. Design and construction of the processing plant was done by Parsons- Jurden of the US. Production units of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex involve the mine itself, concentrator, smelter, refinery, foundries and leaching. Administratively, the settlement is in the Sarcheshmeh Rural District, in the Central District of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 53, in 14 families.

In 2005 the roll was approximately 1100 students. It was founded in the 1880s as the Wellington College of Design (later the Wellington Technical Art School) to provide a more appropriate education for the Dominion than the narrow academic training provided by the existing schools. It is the first co-educational secondary in New Zealand. It is one of only two schools in Wellington (along with Onslow College), and one of only a few New Zealand secondary schools that does not have a school uniform. Many of the current buildings date from the 1980s and are in the neo- brutalist style pyramidal roofs. History Wellington High School, and the institutions from which the current school evolved, have a significant place in the history of public education in New Zealand. It was founded in 1886 by Arthur Dewhurst Riley as the Wellington College of Design. In 1891 the school became Wellington Technical School. It moved to its present site on Taranaki Street from Mercer Street in 1922. Riley was a pioneer of technical and vocational education in New Zealand and his views influenced the Manual and Technical Instruction Act of 1900. In 1964 the secondary and tertiary education parts separated, the upper part becoming Wellington Polytechnical School. Wellington Poly has now become Massey University's Wellington Campus. Other technical schools have also gone on to become tertiary institutions, including Auckland University of Technology and Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology. The school retains a large community education programme. In 2014, an additional MƒÅori name was chosen to sit alongside the established and venerable name of Wellington High School; \\"Te Kura Tuarua o Taraika ki Pukeahu\\". MƒÅori language students were deeply involved in the planning and implementation of the additional name. Taraika is the name of the school Marae. Pukeahu is the area of land on which the school stands. The students presented their idea to the school‚Äôs whƒÅnau group, Te WhƒÅnau a Taraika and the school‚Äôs Board of Trustees as well as consultation undertaken with Taranaki WhƒÅnui ki Te Upoko o te Ika te mana whenua. The additional name was formally adopted at the school's annual Whakanuia celebration in October 2014. Current affairs The neo-brutalist architecture of WHS The entrance to Wellington High School The School was New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Export Awards Education Exporter of the Year 2004.Market New Zealand In 2004, the school made the national headlines when students campaigned for the eviction of the Wellington branch of the Destiny Church, which was using the school hall for its services. Over 50% of enrolled students signing their names to a petition. In 2006, in response to research on Wellington High students, and an award-winning student video, Principal Prue Kelly introduced a scheme which allows senior students' first classes to begin at 10:20am (as opposed to 8:45am). This issue has received much media coverage, and generated very little controversy. Principal Prue Kelly was confident that this progressive trial in timetable restructuring would \\"catch on\\" and other schools would begin to adopt it as well. As well as the senior 10 o'clock start, all years receive a late start on Wednesdays. In 2016, Wellington High became the first school in Wellington to provide gender-neutral toilets. WHS converted one floor's separate single sex bathrooms to two sets of gender-neutral bathrooms. The urinals were removed from the boys' bathrooms, and bins added. Signage simply says 'bathroom.' There was a lot of media surrounding the change, and WHS released a media release requesting that the media accept the privacy of students, writing that they are now \\"getting on with the business of learning.\\" Later in 2016, Onslow College converted a block of their toilets to gender-neutral. Radio station The school had a student-run radio station, LiveWire, which transmitted at 107.1. It had a range of approximately 4 km. The radio station ceased broadcasting at the end of 2007. In February 2011, the radio station was revived as High-Fi FM. It is operated by students from the school. The radio station still has the same specifications of a 4 km broadcast range and runs 24/7 on 107.3FM. Board of Trustees The Wellington High School board consists of eleven appointed and elected members. It is currently chaired by Deanne Daysh.

Although Irwin-Rippe cautions in 2005 that the use of \\"multiple organ failure\\" or \\"multisystem organ failure\\" should be avoided, both Harrison's (2015) and Cecil's (2012) medical textbooks still use the terms \\"multi-organ failure\\" and \\"multiple organ failure\\" in several chapters, and do not use \\"multiple organ dysfunction syndrome\\" at all. Cause The condition usually results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism. The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Sepsis is the most common cause of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome and may result in septic shock. In the absence of infection, a sepsis-like disorder is termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both SIRS and sepsis could ultimately progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, in one- third of the patients no primary focus can be found. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is well established as the final stage of a continuum: SIRS + infection File:U+2192.svg sepsis File:U+2192.svg severe sepsis File:U+2192.svg Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Currently, investigators are looking into genetic targets for possible gene therapy to prevent the progression to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome. Some authors have conjectured that the inactivation of the transcription factors NF-Œ∫B and AP-1 would be appropriate targets in preventing sepsis and SIRS. These two genes are pro-inflammatory. However, they are essential components of a normal healthy immune response, so there is risk of increasing vulnerability to infection, which can also cause clinical deterioration. Pathophysiology A definite explanation has not been found. Local and systemic responses are initiated by tissue damage. Respiratory failure is common in the first 72 hours. Subsequently, one might see liver failure (5‚Äì7 days), gastrointestinal bleeding (10‚Äì15 days) and kidney failure (11‚Äì17 days). =Gut hypothesis= The most popular hypothesis by Deitch to explain MODS in critically ill patients is the gut hypothesis. Due to splanchnic hypoperfusion and the subsequent mucosal ischaemia there are structural changes and alterations in cellular function. This results in increased gut permeability, changed immune function of the gut and increased translocation of bacteria. Liver dysfunction leads to toxins escaping into the systemic circulation and activating an immune response. This results in tissue injury and organ dysfunction. =Endotoxin macrophage hypothesis= Gram-negative infections in MODS patients are relatively common, hence endotoxins have been advanced as principal mediator in this disorder. It is thought that following the initial event cytokines are produced and released. The pro-inflammatory mediators are: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±), interleukin-1, interleukin-6, thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide. =Tissue hypoxia-microvascular hypothesis= As a result of macro- and microvascular changes insufficient supply of oxygen occurs. Hypoxemia causes cell death and organ dysfunction. =Mitochondrial DNA hypothesis= According to findings of Professor Zsolt Balogh and his team at University of Newcastle (Australia), mitochondrial DNA is the leading cause of severe inflammation due to a massive amount of mitochondrial DNA that leaks into the bloodstream due to cell death of patients that survived major trauma. Mitochondrial DNA resembles bacterial DNA. If bacteria triggers leukocytes, mitochondrial DNA may do the same. When confronted with bacteria, white blood cells, or neutrophil granulocytes, behave like predatory spiders. They spit out a web, or net, to trap the invaders, then hit them with a deadly oxidative blast, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). This results in catastrophic immune response leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. =Integrated hypothesis= Since in most cases no primary cause is found, the condition could be part of a compromised homeostasis involving the previous mechanisms. Diagnosis The European Society of Intensive Care organized a consensus meeting in 1994 to create the \\"Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)\\" score to describe and quantitate the degree of organ dysfunction in six organ systems. Using similar physiologic variables the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score was developed. Four clinical phases have been suggested: *Stage 1: the patient has increased volume requirements and mild respiratory alkalosis which is accompanied by oliguria, hyperglycemia and increased insulin requirements. *Stage 2: the patient is tachypneic, hypocapnic and hypoxemic; develops moderate liver dysfunction and possible hematologic abnormalities. *Stage 3: the patient develops shock with azotemia and acid-base disturbances; has significant coagulation abnormalities. *Stage 4: the patient is vasopressor dependent and oliguric or anuric; subsequently develops ischemic colitis and lactic acidosis. =Definition= Multiple dysfunction syndrome is the presence of altered organ function in acutely ill patients such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention. It usually involves two or more organ systems. It calls for an immediate intervention. Management At present, there is no drug or device that can reverse organ failure that has been judged by the health care team to be medically and/or surgically irreversible (organ function can recover, at least to a degree, in patients whose organs are very dysfunctional, where the patient has not died; and some organs, like the liver or the skin, can regenerate better than others),- with the possible exception of single or multiple organ transplants or the use of artificial organs or organ parts, in certain candidates in specific situations. Therapy, therefore, is usually mostly limited to supportive care, i.e. safeguarding hemodynamics, and respiration. Maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation is a principal target. Starting enteral nutrition within 36 hours of admission to an intensive care unit has reduced infectious complications. Prognosis Mortality varies from 30% to 100% where the chance of survival is diminished as the number of organs involved increases. Since the 1980s the mortality rate has not changed. In patients with sepsis, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is due to major trauma, the rs1800625 polymorphism is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism, a part of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) transmembrane receptor gene (of the immunoglobulin superfamily) and confers host susceptibility to sepsis and MODS in these patients. History The historical origin of the concept of MODS is as follows. For many years, some patients were loosely classified as having sepsis or the sepsis syndrome. In more recent years, these concepts have been refined ‚Äì so that there are specific definitions of sepsis ‚Äì and two new concepts have been developed: the SIRS and MODS.

It is the People's Republic of China's first-ever law on road traffic safety, and was intended to address an alarmingly high traffic fatality rate, which is four or five times greater than other nations. Background The new law has a number of focus points: * Under the new law, when accidents occur between pedestrians or non-motorised vehicles and motor vehicles, except for the case where the pedestrian or the non-motorised vehicle deliberately causes the incident, the motorist must always bear responsibility. Responsibility for the motorist is reduced if the pedestrian or non-motorised side violated traffic laws. * The new law enforces a vehicle insurance system. Insurance on motor vehicles is now compulsory instead of voluntary. * It abolished a previous regulation which banned holders of driver's licences of the PRC driving rights on expressways until one year after they had held the licence. * Expressway speed limits were increased from 110 km/h to 120 km/h. * Even harsher penalties were put in place for drunk driving and driving by people who did not hold a valid driver's licence, or drove a vehicle without licence plates. * Cases where drivers were speeding 50% in excess of the applicable speed limit will result in the revocation of the driver's licence. * The penalty for hit-and-run accidents is permanent revocation of one's driver's licence. * The pre-existing point system for penalties was integrated into the new law. * Penalties are now higher, from the former RMB 200 up to RMB 2000. Also, provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions can only enact specific penalties within the given range. Previously, the nationwide maximum penalty was RMB 200, but areas like Beijing and Kunming had enacted laws mandating penalties in the thousands of RMB. Beijing's own \\"implementation procedures\\" of the new traffic law was passed on October 22, 2004, after being the target of heavy controversy over the responsibilities of vehicle drivers and pedestrians, and a regulation limiting the lanes that can be used by novice drivers. These take effect on January 1, 2005. According to Xinhua News Agency, \\"police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law\\". According to the People's Daily, Chinese army and police seized thousands of fake military license plates and IDs.

The article also includes an Abstract of a Letter from Darwin to Asa Gray, and an introductory letter by Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell. The article was the first announcement of the Darwin‚ÄìWallace theory of evolution by natural selection; and appeared in print on 20 August 1858. The presentation of the papers spurred Darwin to write a condensed \\"abstract\\" of his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection. This was published in November 1859 as On the Origin of Species.  Events leading up to the publication  On the voyage of the Beagle the young Charles Darwin took a break between graduating and starting his career as a clergyman to study the natural history of South America, an interest he had developed at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cambridge. Influenced by Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, he became an able geologist as well as collecting plant and animal specimens, and fossils of gigantic extinct mammals. By the return journey, he was connecting patterns of geographical and historical distribution, and starting to doubt the stability of Species. In September 1838 he conceived his theory of natural selection as the cause of evolution, then as well as developing his career as a geologist and writer worked privately on finding evidence and answering possible objections. He wrote out his ideas in an 1842 \\"pencil sketch\\", then in an essay written in 1844. He discussed transmutation with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, who read the essay in 1847. After turning his attention to biology and completing eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin intensified work on his theory of species in 1854. Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist working in Borneo, had a paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species published in Annals and Magazine of Natural History. This made guarded comments about evolution, and in the spring of 1856 it was noticed by Lyell who drew it to the attention of Darwin who was then working out a strategy for presenting his theory. Darwin apparently mistook Wallace's meaning, writing \\"nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree, [but] it seems all creation with him\\". However, he spelt out the details of Natural Selection to Lyell, who found the idea hard to accept but urged Darwin to publish to establish priority.. On 14 May 1856 Darwin began what became his draft for a book titled Natural Selection. Wallace collected specimens and corresponded with Darwin from Borneo. In December 1857, he wrote to ask if Darwin's book would delve into human origins, to which Darwin responded that \\"I think I shall avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist\\". He encouraged Wallace's theorising, saying \\"without speculation there is no good & original observation\\", adding that \\"I go much further than you\\". Wallace wrote his paper On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type at Ternate in February 1858 and sent it to Darwin with a request to send it on to Lyell. Darwin received it on 18 June 1858, and wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance,... forestalled\\" and \\"If Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract!\\" While Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin would, \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose. He sadly added that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell's immediate response urged Darwin to publish his own ideas, and in his reply of 25 June Darwin agreed that he could point to his own Essay of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and a letter to Asa Gray of 1857 showing that he was still developing the ideas, \\"so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself that I can do so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit\\", also requesting that Hooker be invited to give a second opinion. Darwin was overwrought by a deepening crisis of illness of his baby son Charles Waring Darwin, who died of scarlet fever on 28 June. On the morning of the 29th he acknowledged Hooker's letters, writing \\"I cannot think now\\", then that night he read the letters, and though \\"quite prostrated\\", got his servant to take to Hooker Wallace's essay, the letter to Asa Gray and the Essay of 1844, leaving matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker. Lyell and Hooker had decided on a joint publication at the Linnean Society of London of Wallace's paper together with an extract from Darwin's essay and his letter to Asa Gray. The last meeting of the society before the summer recess had been postponed following the death of former president the botanist Robert Brown on 10 June 1858, and was to be held on 1 July. On the afternoon of 30 June Mrs. Hooker copied out extracts from the handwritten documents they had just received from Darwin, then that evening Lyell and Hooker handed them in to the secretary with a covering letter.  The reading  The papers were read to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, by the Secretary John Joseph Bennett. Neither author was present. Darwin was attending the funeral of his son, and Wallace was still in Borneo. The meeting was chaired by the President of the society, Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition. About thirty were present, including two unnamed guests from overseas, with many there to hear an obituary notice for the former president and botanist Robert Brown given by Lyell. Wallace's natural history agent Samuel Stevens happened to be present, while Darwin's friends there included William Benjamin Carpenter and the geologist William Henry Fitton. Amongst the others, Daniel Oliver and Arthur Henfry would later support evolution, while Cuthbert Collingwood became an opponent. George Bentham was persuaded by Hooker to step down so that the Darwin and Wallace papers were first on the agenda, followed by six other papers on botanical and zoological topics. Bell had introduced discussions at the end of meetings, but there was no discussion of natural selection, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with, or possibly due to polite reluctance to speak out against a theory which the eminent Lyell and Hooker were supporting. Bentham noted that the audience appeared fatigued. Hooker later said there was \\"no semblance of a discussion\\", though \\"it was talked over with bated breath\\" at tea afterwards, and in his reminiscences many years later thought \\"the subject [was] too ominous for the old school to enter the lists before armouring.\\" Although Bell apparently disapproved, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.. Darwin wrote to Wallace to explain what had occurred, enclosing a letter which Hooker wrote at Darwin's request. His next action was to get his family away from the danger of infection, both himself and Emma exhausted by sickening fear about the safety of their children. The day after the funeral they moved to his sister-in-law's in Sussex, then on to Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. At first they stayed in the King's Hotel, Shanklin, and on 30 July Darwin began writing an \\"abstract\\" of his book on Natural Selection, planning a short paper in response to Hooker's urging to publish a scientific paper in the Linnean journal. They next rented a villa in Sandown and Darwin pressed on, with the facts he felt necessary to support his \\"abstract\\" expanding far beyond the thirty pages Hooker had originally suggested..  The paper  The paper, consisting of the letter and papers, was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 3 (20 August): 46‚Äì50. The paper consisted of a communication letter by Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell dated 30 June 1859, giving information on the three sections of the papers. The introduction is shown below, along with the section headings:. > MY DEAR SIR,‚ÄîThe accompanying papers, which we have the honour of > communicating to the Linnean Society, and which all related to the same > subject, viz. the Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races, and > Species, contain the results of the investigations of two indefatigable > naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace. The gentlemen > having, independently and unknown to one another, conceived the same very > ingenious theory to account for the appearance and perpetuation of varieties > and of specific forms on our planet, and both fairly claim the merit of > being original thinkers in this important line of inquiry; but neither of > them having published his views, though Mr. Darwin has for many years past > been repeatedly urged by us to do so, and both authors having now > unreservedly placed their papers in our hands, we think it would best > promote the interests of science that a selection from them should be laid > before the Linnean Society. Taken in the order of their dates, they consist > of:‚Äî > > > I. Extract from an unpublished Work on Species, by C. DARWIN, Esq., > consisting of a portion of a Chapter entitled, \\"On the Variation of Organic > Beings in a state of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection; on the > Comparison of Domestic Races and true Species.\\" > > II. Abstract of a Letter from C. DARWIN, Esq., to Prof. ASA GRAY, Boston, > US, dated Down, September 5th, 1857. > > III. On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original > Type. By ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE. The communication letter briefly describes the first two, and regarding Wallace's paper states that he sent to Darwin \\"with the expressed wish that it should be forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin thought it sufficiently novel and interesting. So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace's consent to allow the Essay to be published as soon as possible. Of this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not withhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour of Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and the contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years. On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what use we thought proper of his memoir, &c.; and in adopting our present course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we have explained to him that we are not solely considering the relative claims to priority of himself and his friend, but the interests of science generally\\". Impact of the publication The paper was reprinted and reviewed in several magazines including The Zoologist, whose judgement was \\"on asking myself, 'What does all this prove?' the only answer I could make was, 'A possibility'.\\" It was commented on in some reviews and letters. The Linnean Society President Thomas Bell in his presidential report of May 1859 wrote that \\"The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear\\". Years later, Darwin could only recall one review; Professor Haughton of Dublin claimed that \\"all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old.\\". Despite illness, Darwin pressed on with writing the \\"abstract\\" of his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection; this condensed version was published in November 1859 as On the Origin of Species.  As an influence on cybernetics  In a largely overlooked passage from Wallace's essay, he says of the evolutionary principle: > The action of this principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal > governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities > almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced > deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, > because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering > existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. The cybernetician and anthropologist Gregory Bateson would observe in the 1970s that though seeing it only as an illustration, Wallace had \\"probably said the most powerful thing that‚Äôd been said in the 19th century\\".

From 1785‚Äî1794, he took part in the expedition sponsored by Empress Catherine II and led by Royal Navy officer Joseph Billings. Sarychev, on ship Slava Rossii (Glory of Russia), described and mapped the coastline of the Sea of Okhotsk from Okhotsk to Aldoma, many of the Aleutian Islands (especially Unalaska). He also described the islands of Pribylov, St. Matthew Island, St. Lawrence Island, Gvozdev, and King Island. In 1802‚Äî1806, Sarychev led the Baltic hydrographic expedition.

It was part of the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The British under Gerard Lake were anxious to finish the war by neutralizing the last substantial force that the Maratha confederacy possessed, consisting of twelve battalions of regular infantry trained by the adventurer Chevalier Dudrenec. Dudrenec deserted the Marathas and command fell onto Ambaji Ingle, a Maratha officer. Lake decided to dispense first with his artillery and later with his infantry in a series of forced marches to catch up with the Maratha force. Lake initially encountered the enemy force with just three brigades of cavalry, but the British troopers by repeated charges were able to contain the Maratha army until the British infantry arrived. The British units, commanded by Lake, were about 10,000 men strong, opposing Sindhia's force of 9,000 veteran infantry and 5,000 cavalry under the command of Abaji. The British units were also supported by additional allied troops from Alwar. A map of the two phases of the battle The Maratha infantry made a most gallant defence, standing their ground until the survivors laid down their arms. The cavalry also suffered heavily. The British captured 72 guns and a large quantity of ammunition and stores. Lake later wrote, \\"I never was in so severe a business in my life or anything like it‚Ä¶ these fellows fought like devils, or rather like heroes\\".quoted in Calvert, Michael & Young, Peter: A Dictionary of Battles (1715-1815) (New English Library, London / Mayflower Books, New York 1979)p.79. \\"The casualties on both sides were very heavy. The Company lost many officers, including Maj. Gen. Weir, Col. Vandeleur and Maj. Griffith. Lakes's son was also killed.\\" On 17 December 1803, Raghuji Bhonsale (II) of Nagpur signed the Treaty of Deogaon with the British after the Battle of Laswari and gave up the province of Cuttack including Balasore.  Events of the Battle  After storming Aligarh on 4th September 1803, General Lake advanced to Delhi where the Marathas under Perron and Bourquien were again defeated. At the end of September, Lake left Delhi and marched on to Agra. He took the fort at Agra by storm. However, there still remained fifteen regular battalions, which Sindhia had sent from the Deccan under the command of Chevalier Dudrenec and though the latter surrendered himself to the British force at Mathura, his battalions remained intact and were, indeed, augmented by two others, which had escaped from Delhi. This powerful force made no attempt to prevent the capture of Agra by Lord Lake, its object being to recover Delhi, the recapture of which was regarded by Sindhia as the first importance to his prestige. General Lake marched westward from Agra on October 27, 1803, against this force, which was known to be near Kathumar, a place 27 miles (about 43 Km.) north-west of Bharatpur. When he reached here on 31 St October in the evening, he learnt that the enemy had left the place that very morning and retreated northwards. Lake was joined on 29th October by Ahmad Bakhsh Khan, the Vakil of the Alwar ruler, with a body of troops and contingent of Meos, who gave useful help in providing supplies and furnishing information about the movement of the Marathas. The Marathas after bombarding Kathumar in the afternoon of 29th October, stayed there till they heard of the advance of Lake. They marched northwards with the intention of entrenching themselves in the strong fort of Kishangarh but were overtaken on 1st November by Lake at Laswari, twenty miles (32 Km.) east of the city of Alwar, on the banks of Ruparel. A well manoeuvred attack coupled with Lake‚Äôs presence of mind and his son‚Äôs extraordinary gallantry, brought the Marathas on the brink of complete annihilation. The casualty on the side of the vanquished was heavy-700 men killed and 2000 prisoners. Bristish loss was about 800.

It is in Loughborough, in the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England. The business originated in the 14th century and became Taylor's after the Taylor family took over in 1784. In September 2009 Taylors went into administration but was bought out of administration by a consortium called UK Bellfoundries Ltd, led by Andrew Wilby, which successfully re-financed and re- established the business. Since then the company has re-established its presence both in the UK and in the Carillon and other export markets. In 2018 the company established a subsidiary called John Taylor International, based in Australia, to serve the southern hemisphere markets. In 2016 the Directors of UK Bellfoundries Ltd founded the Loughborough Bellfoundry Trust and transferred ownership of the buildings, equipment, intellectual property and the Museum to that body in perpetuity to safeguard it for the future. The Trust has received emergency grants to restore several parts of the building from Historic England as it was listed as a Grade 2* building at risk. Further restoration is planned. The company manufactures bells for use in clock towers, rings of bells for change ringing, chimes, and carillons. In 2005 John Taylor's had merged with Eayre & Smith Ltd (bellhangers) and from 2005 until 2009 became Taylors Eayre & Smith Ltd.Foundry Merger accessed 20 June 2007 The Foundry has a museum of bells and bellfounding which is the only one of its kind in the UK. The restoration of the foundry buildings began with the re- opening in 2012 of the foundry's own Campanile which contains the most-pealed bells in the World. It is one of the few Victorian purpose-built manufacturing sites still being used for its original purpose and therefore of considerable heritage merit. History Inside the belfry of St Stephen's Church, Bristol, England. In 1970 Taylor's cast five of the twelve bells and a new frame in which they re-hung all twelve.

Initially it was known as the University of Lithuania, but in 1930 the university was renamed to Vytautas Magnus University, commemorating 500 years of death of Vytautas the Great, the Lithuanian ruler, well known for the nation's greatest historical expansion in the 15th century. It is one of the leading universities of Lithuania which has about 8,800 students, including Master's students and Ph.D. candidates. There are a little more than 1000 employees, including approximately 90 professors.* http://www.vdu.lt/wp- content/uploads/2012/02/2015-Rek.Ataskaita-2014_-virsel.pdf ‚Äì public report 2014Studij≈≥ kokybƒós ir vertinimo centras. 2014.  History  = Establishment of University = The beginnings of higher education in Lithuania go back to the 16th century when in 1579 the college founded by Jesuits in Vilnius became a higher school of education ‚Äì Academia et Universitas Vilnensis. In 1832 in the aftermath of the November Uprising Czar Nicholas I closed the university. Building where Higher Courses were established, that later became University of Lithuania However, in 1918 with the establishment of the independent Republic of Lithuania, the State Council decided to reestablish Vilnius University. Since Vilnius was later under Polish administration and the Lithuanian government had to be transferred to Kaunas, this decision was not put into effect. At the beginning of 1920, Higher Courses of Study were established in Kaunas, laying the foundation for the establishment of a university. The Lithuanian Cabinet of Ministers decided to establish the University of Lithuania in Kaunas, February 13, 1922. The ceremonial opening of the university took place February 16, 1922, while on the 12th of April the President of Lithuania confirmed the university's Statute along with six faculties: Theology-Philosophy, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Sciences, Medicine and Technical Studies. The affiliate Agricultural Academy was founded in 1924 on the basis of the Agronomy and Forestry sections of the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences; in 1936 the Veterinary Academy was established in a similar fashion on the basis of the Veterinary section of the Faculty of Medicine. On June 7, 1930 commemorating 500 years of the death of Vytautas the Great, the University was renamed in his honor (, ). = Interwar period = Sugihara House, VMU Centre for Asian Studies In 1940, Vytautas Magnus University contributed to the reestablishment of Vilnius University. In the winter, the faculties of Humanities and Law were transferred to Vilnius whilst the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences was moved in the summer. The occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union forced the university to be named the University of Kaunas in summer 1940. At the beginning of 1941, university professors took an active role in establishing the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. The controversial Lithuanian Provisional Government restored the name of Vytautas Magnus to the university after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in summer 1941. The German occupation government closed the university in March 1943, after some Lithuanians refused to form an SS battalion. The university was reopened by the Soviet authorities of Lithuania in fall 1944. Four faculties of History-Philology, Medicine, Construction, and Technology were established. The transfer of the Faculty of Philosophy to Vilnius was the reason why the University of Kaunas was closed in fall 1949. The university was restructured into Kaunas Polytechnic Institute and the Kaunas Medical Institute on October 31, 1950. = Re- establishment of University = VMU Botanical Garden The act of re- establishing Vytautas Magnus University was proclaimed April 28, 1989. The Supreme Soviet of Lithuania passed the law re-establishing the university on July 4, 1989, while the Council of Ministers registered the temporary Statute for the university's period of re-establishment on July 22. The first academic year began in the university's re-established Faculties of Economics, Humanities and Sciences September 1, 1989. The re-established university was the second in then Soviet-occupied Lithuania, and the first school of higher education that was independent of governmental institutions. The most important principle in the university's activity became academic freedom, while its main purpose was to prepare graduates with a broad humanistic orientation for Lithuania's needs in research, culture, education and economy. A common program of study in humanities and general education for the first two years of study for all students appeared in 1990. Its aim was to develop well-rounded individuals who were free and creative. In 1991 the university was the first in Lithuania to establish in a system of study based on several levels, the completion of which resulted in the granting of Bachelor's or Master's degrees, as well as the Doctoral degrees. The feature of this university still remains exceptional in Lithuania today: this is a liberal policy for studies, according to which students are admitted not into specific specializations but into fields of study. The students themselves put together their plan of study and make a final choice of their program after the first two years of study. Particular attention is given to foreign languages and computer skills thus making this university different from other schools of higher education in the country. During the university's first decade the number of students and teachers grew more than twenty times. It has become the center for academic work in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Theology and Fine Arts, Political Sciences and Law in Kaunas. Modern programs have been expanding in: Informatics, Environmental Sciences, Biology, Mathematics and Physics. Master's and Doctoral studies became a priority at the university and demanded a pedagogical staff with high qualifications. Therefore, the university invited to its classrooms and laboratories the most celebrated of scholars from Lithuania's research institutes, creating in 1993 the first Research and Study Association in Lithuania. Ten Lithuanian research institutes formed this association together with the university: the Institutes for Lithuanian History, Lithuanian Language, Lithuanian Literature and Folklore, Lithuanian Philosophy and Sociology, biochemistry, Mathematics and Informatics, Semiconductor Physics, Psychophysiology and Rehabilitation, Architecture and Civil Engineering, and Lithuanian Forestry. The university has the right to grant doctoral degrees in nineteen scholarly fields and their branches and the Doctor Habilitus in eight fields. The pedagogical titles of professor and associate professor may be granted in the fields of Humanities, Social Sciences, Physics and Biomedicine.

Pierre de B√©rulle (4 February 1575 ‚Äì 2 October 1629), was a French Catholic priest, cardinal and statesman, one of the most important mystics of the 17th century in France. He was the founder of the French school of spirituality, who could count among his friends and disciples Vincent de Paul and Francis de Sales. Life Cardinal Pierre de B√©rulle B√©rulle was born in the Ch√¢teau of C√©rilly, near Troyes in Champagne, into two families of distinguished magistrates on 4 February 1575.Ingold, Augustin. \\"Pierre de B√©rulle.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 12 Jun. 2013 The ch√¢teau de C√©rilly is situated in the modern department of Yonne, while the village adjacent to it, B√©rulle, is in Aube. He was educated by the Jesuits at Clermont and at the Sorbonne in Paris. He published his first work, his Bref Discours de l'abnegation interieure, in 1597. Soon after his ordination as a priest in 1599, he assisted Cardinal Duperron in his public controversy with the Protestant Philippe de Mornay, and made numerous converts. With the co-operation of his cousin, Madame Acarie (Marie of the Incarnation) in 1604 he introduced the Discalced Carmelite nuns of the reform of Teresa of Avila into France. In 1608, Vincent de Paul moved to Paris, where he came under the influence of Abb√© (later Cardinal) Pierre de B√©rulle, whom he took as his spiritual director. De B√©rulle was responsible for De Paul taking up an appointment to the parish of Clichy.\\"Berulle, Pierre de\\", Vincentian Online Library A mainstay of the Counter-Reformation in France, in 1611 B√©rulle founded in Paris the Congregation of the French Oratory, on the model of the one founded in 1556 by Philip Neri at Rome. Owing to the differences of time and place the French congregation varied in some important respects from the Italian Oratory. Whereas in the Italian congregation the houses were independent of one another, de B√©rulle placed the government of all the houses in the hands of the superior-general.Ingold, Augustin. \\"French Congregation of the Oratory.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 Jun. 2013 Statesman B√©rulle was a chaplain to King Henry IV of France, and several times declined his offers to be made a bishop. He obtained the necessary dispensations from Rome for Henrietta Maria's marriage to Charles I, and acted as her chaplain during the first year of her stay in England. In 1626, as French ambassador to Spain, he concluded the favourable Treaty of Monz√≥n, to which his enemy Cardinal Richelieu found objections. After the reconciliation of King Louis XIII with his mother, Marie de Medici, through his agency, he was appointed a councillor of state, but had to resign this office, owing to his pro-Habsburg policy, which was opposed by Richelieu. For religious reasons, Cardinal B√©rulle favored the allegiance of France with Austria and Spain, the other Catholic powers, while Cardinal Richelieu wanted to undermine their influence in Europe.Miranda, Salvatore. \\"\\"Pierre de B√©rulle\\", Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Florida International University He was made cardinal by Pope Urban VIII on 30 August 1627, but never received the red hat. Pierre de B√©rulle died October 2, 1629 in Paris, while celebrating Mass, and was buried in the chapel of the Oratorian College of Juilly. French School of Spirituality In the early part of his career, B√©rulle was confident of the ability of the individual to both remake society and reform the church. Relying on human reason and diligent effort, he worked to convert the Huguenots through theological treatises and conferences. When his efforts seemed to have little effect, he came to the realization that everything depended on God, and that one should attempt to live in accordance with the will of God without concern for success or failure.Minton, Anne M., \\"The Spirituality of B√©rulle: A New Look\\", Order of Preachers - Central Province B√©rulle is generally regarded as being an initiator of the French School of Spirituality, a powerful spiritual, missionary, and reform movement that animated the church in France in the early seventeenth century. The movement was characterized by: a deep sense of God's grandeur and of the Church as the Body of Christ, a certain pessimistic Augustinian view of man that nonetheless stresses positive potential through God, and a strong apostolic and missionary commitment. B√©rulle's depiction of the mystical journey through Mary to Christ, and through Christ to the Trinity is a hallmark of the French School of spirituality.An Anthology of Christian mysticism by Harvey D. Egan 1991 page 481 The term 'School' is potentially problematic, though, because the other commonly cited members of this 'School', such as Jean Eudes, Jean- Jacques Olier, Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort, and Jean-Baptiste de la Salle, do not simply develop the thought of B√©rulle, but all have their own significant insights. The 'School' does not therefore have simply one founder (a role B√©rulle has sometimes been cast in). However, the many common elements among these writers (such as an emphasis on living in the Spirit of Jesus, particular forms of meditative prayer, a pedagogy institutionalised in particular seminaries and schools), means that it can be considered as a distinct tradition of spirituality.David D Thayer, 'The French School', in Peter Tyler, ed, The Bloomsbury Guide to Christian Spirituality, (2012), p181 Recently, substantial Calvinist influences on Berulle were discovered, which are claimed to have caused his theology of the priesthood to overemphasize the priest's losing his own personality and gaining Christ's, thus preparing the 19th century culture of Catholic clericalism.McGrath-Merkle, Clare. Berulle's Spiritual Theology of Priesthood. Munster: Aschendorff, 2018. Philosophy and Works B√©rulle encouraged Descartes' philosophical studies, and it was through him that the Samaritan Pentateuch, recently brought over from Constantinople, was inserted in Lejay's Bible Polyglotte (1628-45). B√©rulle was an opponent of the abstract school of mysticism that by-passed the humanity of Christ; Pope Urban VIII called him the \\"apostle of the incarnate Word\\". Highly influenced by Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century deference to monarchs, Berulle applied the same principles in the spiritual realm. In his Discours de l'√©tat et des grandeurs de J√©sus B√©rulle emphasized Jesus as the Incarnate Word of God, and the abasement, self-surrender, servitude and humiliation-- all B√©rulle's words-- of his Incarnation. He even took the Incarnation as the defining characteristic of his spirituality and his Oratory, when he asked Christ \\"that, in this piety, devotion, and special servitude to the mystery of Your Incarnation and of Your humanized divinity and deified humanity, be our life and our state, our spirit and our particular difference.\\"Pierre de B√©rulle, Discours de l'√©tat et des grandeurs de J√©sus VIII.13, in J.-P. Migne, ed., ≈íuvres Compl√©tes de de B√©rulle (Paris: J.-P. Migne, 1856), 314. The chief works of Cardinal de B√©rulle are: * Bref discours de l'abn√©gation int√©rieure (Brief Discourse on Interior Abnegation), (1597). * Trait√© des √©nergum√®nes (Treatise on the Possessed), (Troyes, 1599). (This addresses the nature of diabolical possession, a topic of much controversy at the time. Diabolical possession, B√©rulle argued, consists \\"precisely in a right which the malign spirit has of residing in [the possessed person's] body and of altering it in some manner.\\"Pierre de B√©rulle, Trait√© des √©nergum√®nes VI.1, in J.-P. Migne, ed., ≈íuvres Compl√©tes de de B√©rulle (Paris: J.-P. Migne, 1856), 860. At its heart lay the profound diabolical hostility to the Incarnation, such that Satan, through possession, attempts to ape God, becoming \\"incarnate\\" himself.) * Trois Discours de controverse (Three Discourses of Controversy), (Paris, 1609), on various subjects. * Discours de l'√©tat et des grandeurs de J√©sus (Discourse on the State and Grandeurs of Jesus), (Paris, 1623). This work was reprinted several times; the substance and often the actual expressions are to be found in the diffuse M√©ditations of Father Bourgoing and also in Bossuet's El√©vations sur les myst√®res. The work was also popular among Jansenists. * Vie de J√©sus (Life of Jesus), (Paris, 1629). This was a sequel to the preceding work, which the author left unfinished at the time of his death, having only had the time to consider the mystery of the Annunciation and partially (in a draft) the Visitation. * El√©vation √† J√©sus-Christ sur Sainte Madeleine (Elevation to Jesus Christ Regarding St. [Mary] Magdalene), (Paris, 1627). In addition, B√©rulle wrote a number of short devotional works (≈íuvres de piet√©) and documents for the guidance of the Oratory. B√©rulle's works, edited by P. Bourgoing (2 vols., 1644) were reprinted, by Migne in 1857.

Career under Henry III Returning to Normandy, du Perron's existence and his talents were drawn to the attention of a courtier who was visiting General Jacques of Matignon, the Governor of Normandy. This courtier, named Lancosme, took du Perron along with him when he returned to Blois,This is the version followed by Pralard, Biblioth√®que des auteurs ecclesiastiques, p. 76. A different scenario is given by Burigny (pp. 12-13), who states that du Perron was taken to Blois by the Marechal de Matignon, who was going there to attend the Estates General. The Estates General met from December 2, 1576 to March 1, 1577, at the palace at Blois. where the new King, Henry III of France, was residing.\\"La vie de l' illustrissime Cardinal du Perron\\", in Les divers Oeuvres, pp. 15-16.

He was appointed Reader to the King by Henry III [Lecteur de la chambre du Roy].Les Divers Oeuvres de l' illustrissime Cardinal du Perron (Paris 1629) p. 581, and elsewhere.

On the death of Mary, Queen of Scots (February 8, 1587), he was chosen by the King to compose a poem in her honor and about her fate.\\"La vie de l' illusstrisime Cardinal du Perron\\", in Les divers Oeuvres de l' illustrissime Cardinal du Perron seconde edition (Paris 1629), p. 20. Feret, pp. 14-15, points out that the solemn memorial service took place at Notre Dame on March 13, 1587, and that the Archbishop of Bourges, Renaud de Beaune, preached the funeral oration. De Thou, Histoires Book 86, chapter 16, confirms that du Perron was commissioned to write a poem. Career under Henry IV On the death of Henry III (August 2, 1589), after having supported for some time the cardinal de Bourbon, the head of the league against the king, Du Perron eventually became a faithful servant of Henry IV. On February 13, 1590, however, he found himself compelled to write directly to the King, begging him not to believe the many calumnies being spread about by his enemies.C√©sar de Ligny, Les ambassades et negotiations de L' Illustrissime et Reverendissime Cardinal du Perron (Paris: Pierre Lamy 1633), pp. 1-3.

D'Ossat, distinctly the second figure, is mentioned in a letter to the King at p. 861. Du Perron and d'Ossat performed the act of abjuration of Henri's heresy on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica on September 17, 1595,Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa VI (Roma 1793), p. 102. thereby ending six years of controversy over the status of France and its King in the eyes of the Papacy. He departed Rome on March 28, 1596. On his return to his diocese, Du Perron's zeal and eloquence were largely instrumental in withstanding the progress of Calvinism, and among others he converted and the Swiss general Sancy and Henry Sponde, who became bishop of Pamiers. At the conference at Fontainebleau in 1600 he argued with much eloquence and ingenuity against Du Plessis Mornay (1549‚Äì1623). Cardinal du Perron On June 9, 1604, the Bishop of √âvreux was created a cardinal by Pope Clement VIII, at the request of King Henri IV. In a letter of June 17, 1604, King Henry IV was able to inform the Bishop that the Pope had indeed named him a cardinal.Feret, pp. 293-294. Du Perron is called \\"Mon cousin\\" for the first time.

His instructions from Henri IV required him to hold conversations with the Duke of Savoy and the Duke of Tuscany along the way.Recueil des lettres missives de Henri IV IV, p. 328. He and the Grand Duke discussed, among other things, possible candidates for the Papacy in the next Conclave, most especially the Great-grand nephew of Leo X, Cardinal Alessandro de' Medici, Archbishop of Florence and Bishop of Palestrina.De Ligny, Les ambassades et negotiations de l' Illustrissime et Reverendissime Cardinal du Perron, p. 540. Cardinal de'Medici was well known in the French Court, since he had been Legatus a latere in France (1596-1598). Henry also sent along general instructions for the French Cardinals in Rome, anticipating a vacancy in the Papal throne.Instructions for Cardinal de Joyeuse, de Givry, de Sourdis, Seraphin, and du Perron. The King had his own distinct opinions as to whom he favored: \\"Ceux au contraire que je desire favoriser et promouvoir sont les cardinaux de Florence [Medici], de Veronne [Valier], Sauli, Cossenze, Camerino [Pierbenedetti], Baronio et S√©raphin [Olivier].\\" Cardinal du Perron made his solemn entry into Rome on December 18.Burigny, Vie du Cardinal du Perron, p. 220-221. In the Consistory of January 7, 1605, he was named Cardinal Priest of S. Agnese in Agone, in Piazza Navona (where the current baroque church was not begun until 1652). Immediately upon his appointment, Clement VIII found important work for du Perron in Rome. The Pope had formed a special commission, the Congregation de auxiliis, the chairmanship of which he retained for himself. But he appointed Cardinal du Perron to the Congregation. The purpose of this commission was to investigate and decide upon the work of the Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, which had raised the acute question of God's Providence and human free will. Du Perron attended his first session on January 21.Burigny, pp. 228-233. Clement was hostile to Molinism, and it was said that he was preparing a bull against it. When Clement VIII died on Thursday, March 3, 1605, the Congregation was suspended, and du Perron found himself involved in his first Conclave. Although he was not the leader of the French faction, he contributed loyally, after the failure of the candidacies of Cardinals Baronius and Seraphin, to the election of the French King's candidate, Cardinal de' Medici, Leo XI, to the papal throne.The Sede Vacante and Conclave of March 3-April 1, 1605 Du Perron sent off a long letter to Henry IV, reporting the day-to-day movements inside the Conclave in great detail.De Ligny, Les ambassades et negotiations de L' Illustrisime et Reverendissime Cardinal du Perron (Paris 1633), pp. 578-638. On the death of Leo XI only twenty-four days later, du Perron participated in the election of Cardinal Camillo BorgheseThe Sede Vacante and Conclave of April 27-May 16, 1605 as Paul V. At the conclusion of the Coronation festivities, Cardinal du Perron wrote a report of the Conclave for Henry IV.De Ligny, Les ambassades et negotiations de L' Illustrisime et Reverendissime Cardinal du Perron (Paris 1633), pp. 673-679. After his election, Paul V decided to continue the Congregation de auxiliis, and therefore du Perron was one of the Judges who began meeting again on September 14, 1605. He complained in a letter to Henry IV that he was constrained to read everything that had been published on the question during the previous eight or nine years. Although he appeared to work well with the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, in presenting the positions of Molinism fairly, du Perron's repeated counsel was not to take any decisions on the basic issues of the matter. Du Perron, after all, had strong Augustinian tendencies, which tended to make Molina's positions uncongenial. Even when he had returned to France in 1607, the Jesuits kept attempting to draw him into their circle, but without success.Burigny, pp. 233-239. But, while du Perron was still in Rome, Pope Paul V decided to pick a quarrel with the Republic of Venice, over its conduct in exercising its sovereign rights. The Venetian government had passed a law against alienation of property in favor of the Church, and another requiring governmental approval for the building of new churches. In addition, there was the very old argument over the exemption of the clergy from civil court jurisdiction. On April 17, 1606, Pope Paul launched a bull against Venice, imposing an interdict on all the territories belonging to the Serenissima. This was certain to lead to war, and would very likely excite the greed of Spain for additional territory in Lombardy.In his letter to King Henry of April 18, du Perron remarks that the Papal Court was in an uproar. The Cardinals who were at the Consistory were all in favor of the Pope's bull but two. The courtiers, however, were of a different opinion ... que jamais chose ne leur vint si mal √† propos, qui feroit maintenant un trouble en Italie, o√π leur reputation est si abaiss√©, leur credit si decheu, leurs moyens si √©puisez, leur domination si odieuse qu' il n' est presques pas croyable. C√©sar de Ligny, Les ambassades et negotiations de L' Illustrissime et Reverendissime Cardinal du Perron (Paris: Pierre Lamy 1633), pp. 863-867. Henry IV, wishing to prevent this, proposed mediation between the Pope and Venice, and offered Cardinal de Joyeuse and Cardinal du Perron as mediators. The status of the Jesuits, who supported the papal interdict, became the main sticking point; the Venetians wanted them gone. Finally, due to the forceful persuasion of Cardinal de Joyeuse (du Perron claimed to be ill), the Pope gave way, the edict was withdrawn, and the crisis averted. Nonetheless, for the work that he had done, the Republic offered du Perron its thanks.Burigny, pp. 243-248. In 1606, while still in Rome, du Perron was appointed archbishop of Sens by the King, an act approved by Pope Paul V in Consistory on October 9, 1606.P. Gauchat, Hierarchia catholica IV (Monasterii 1935), p. 313. Like his predecessor at Sens, he became Primate of the Gauls and Germany, and Grand Almoner of the King of France (which also made him President of the Biblioth√®que du Roi, which at that time was located at Fontainebleau). He was also ex officio the director of the College Royal. The King also appointed him Commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit.Burginy, p. 254. Du Perron began his return to France in the Autumn of 1607. He was received by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence, who wrote to King Henry in praise of du Perron on September 21. He visited Cardinal Giustiniani in Bologna, and then went to Venice, from which he wrote to the King on October 5. He then passed on toward France by way of Milan. After his return from Rome, he was present continually at the Royal Court for more than a year. He did not take possession of his throne in the Cathedral of Sens until October 26, 1608.Feret, p. 295. Gallia christiana XII (Paris 1770), 96-99. After the death of Henry IV in 1610, he took an active part in the states-general of 1614, when he vigorously upheld the ultramontane doctrines against the Third Estate. He died on Wednesday, September 5, 1618, at the age of 63. His viscera were entombed in the Jesuit church of Saint-Louis in Paris, while his body was buried in the Choir of his cathedral in Sens.

The Cramond area has a long history, with evidence of Mesolithic, Bronze Age and Roman activity. In modern times, it was the birthplace of the Scottish economist John Law (1671‚Äì1729). Cramond was incorporated into the City of Edinburgh by the Edinburgh Boundaries Extension and Tramways Act 1920. Etymology It was once believed that Cramond Roman Fort was known to the Romans as Alaterva. A stone altar was dug up in the grounds of Cramond House dedicated \\"To the Alatervan Mothers and the Mothers of the Parade-ground.\\"Site Record for Cramond Edinburgh, Cramond Roman Fort Details ‚Äì Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland Early antiquarians interpreted the inscription as referring to the place where the stone was found, but this idea is no longer accepted among scholars, and \\"Alatervae\\" is presumably a native name for the Matronae, perhaps originating with the Tungrian cohort who erected the altar.\\"The Matres Alatervae (or Alatervia), on the other hand, are mentioned only here, and the significance of the epithet they bear is wholly obscure. Sir John Clerk, in a letter which is printed by Gordon, suggested that it was local and that Alaterva was the Roman name of Cramond. Endorsed by Stukeley, this suggestion has been generally accepted. But it has no foundation in fact. It is much more probable that the Tungrians had brought the designation with them from their native land, and that it is there that Alaterva must be looked for, if indeed it be a place at all.\\" Tenth report with inventory of monuments and constructions in the counties of Midlothian and West Lothian, (1929), page 42. Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions of Scotland In the centuries that followed the end of the Roman occupation, Cramond passed into the hands of the Votadini, who spoke Cumbric, a Brythonic Celtic language, and gave the settlement its name. Cramond is derived from the compound Caer Amon, meaning 'fort on the river', referring to the Roman fort that lay on the River Almond.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South- East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html).  History  The inscription on the Roman altar dedicated to the Alatervan Mothers and the Mothers of the Parade-ground. =Early history=  Pre-Roman  Archaeological excavations at Cramond have uncovered evidence of habitation dating to around 8500 BC, making it, for a time, the earliest known site of human settlement in Scotland. The inhabitants of the Mesolithic camp-site were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved around their territories according to the season of the year.Cramond Heritage Trust (1996), p. 8 Although no bones survived the acid soil, waste pits and stakeholes that would have supported shelters or windbreaks were excavated. Numerous discarded hazelnut shells, the waste product of the inhabitants' staple food, were found in the pits and used to carbon-date the site. It is thought the site was chosen for its location near the junction of the Firth of Forth and the River Almond, where the rich oyster and mussel beds proved a reliable natural resource. Many microlith stone tools manufactured at the site were found, and pre-date finds of similar style in England. Roman period Around 142, Roman forces arrived at Cramond by order of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who had given them the task of establishing a fort at the mouth of the River Almond. This fort would guard the eastern flank of the frontier that the Romans had established across Scotland. Nearly five hundred men worked on the site, building a fort that covered nearly six acres and a harbour for communication. However, the fort was only inhabited for a short time, perhaps fifteen years, before it was abandoned by the troops who were ordered to retreat south to Hadrian's Wall. Pottery and coins of later date indicate that the fort and harbour were reinhabited and used as a base for the army and navy of the Emperor Septimius Severus, sometime between 208 and 211. The medieval parish church of Cramond parish (which retains its late medieval western tower in altered form), was built within the Roman fort. Cramond Lioness Though knowledge of the Roman presence at Cramond was recorded afterwards, the remains of the fort itself were only rediscovered in 1954. Substantial archaeological research was carried out upon its discovery to build up a reasonably accurate picture of the site in Roman times. The fort was rectangular in shape, with walls fifteen feet high on all sides. A gatehouse was set in every wall, allowing access in all four directions. Inside, there were barracks, workshops, granaries, headquarters and the commander's house. Later excavations revealed other constructions outside the boundary of the fort, including a bath-house, further industrial workshops and a native settlement. In 1997 the Cramond Lioness was uncovered in the harbour mud by a local boatman (who received a substantial monetary reward for finding this major antiquity), and was identified as a sandstone statue of a lioness devouring a hapless male figure, probably one of a pair at the tomb of a military commander. After conservation, the statue was displayed in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. It is one of the most ambitious pieces of Roman sculpture to have survived in Scotland.  Medieval period  A map showing the parish of Cramond in 1794. After the departure of the Romans, little is known about the state of Cramond for several centuries. The historiography of the period is perhaps best summed up by the historian J. Wood, who wrote 'a dark cloud of obscurity again settled over the parish of Cramond, of which I cannot find the smallest memorial in any historian till the year 995.'Wood (1794), p. 12 A tower house, Cramond Tower, probably built in the early 15th century, and part of a now- demolished larger establishment, was once a manor house of the Bishops of Dunkeld, of whose diocese Cramond was a part. It was made structurally sound and converted to a private dwelling in the 1980s. =Modern history= Cramond causeway pylons in Edinburgh in the evening light with a walker strolling along the causeway. View of Cramond Causeway looking towards Cramond Cramond developed slowly over the centuries, with Cramond Kirk being founded in 1656. After a brief period spent as an industrial village in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, by the late 19th century it became a desirable suburb of Edinburgh, which it remains to this day. Geography Cramond is located at in northwest Edinburgh, about from the city centre, at the mouth of the River Almond where it enters the Firth of Forth. Historically, the parish of Cramond extended from the shore of the Firth of Forth in the north to the parish of Corstorphine in the south, and was bounded on the west by the parishes of Dalmeny and Kirkliston and on the east by the parish of St Cuthbert's.Wood (1794), p. 1 It covered an area of fifteen square miles, and encompassed the villages of Granton, Pilton, Muirhouse, Davidson's Mains, Blackhall, Ravelston, Craigcrook, Turnhouse and Craigiehall.Brown (2000), p. 1 The area has a low, gently undulating topography that drops down from the top of Corstorphine hill to the shore in three gradual stages and is intersected by the River Almond which flows northward into the Forth.Cramond Heritage Trust (1996), p. 4 During the last ice age the area was heavily glaciated, and the main direction of the ice flow was west to east. Consequently, there are rock deposits on the east side of landforms such as the Almond river valley, and until the Cramond promenade was built in the 1930s large glacial boulders were strewn along the shore. The geology of Cramond consists of calciferous sandstone, which mixed with two later sills to give the area its characteristic chocolate-brown soil. The leaflet \\"Geological history of cramond\\" provides information about the geology of the cramond area such as that there is a coal seam visible near the beach on the south west side of the river almond estuary.\\"Geological history of cramond Edinburgh ... copyright 2014 lothian and borders geoconservation, a committee of the edinburgh geological society, a charity registered in Scotland.

Cramond Kirk Church Hall also displays the smaller Cramond Fish. In the car park, to the rear of the Kirk Hall, another sculpture (elephant) is taking shape. Architecture The older houses along the wharf are typical of traditional south-east Scottish vernacular architecture, constructed in stone with harling white lime render finish, with facing stone window and door surrounds and crow-step gables, roofed with orangey-red clay pantiles imported from the Netherlands. A ruined water mill lies further up the Almond along a quiet walk past a yacht club and sailing boats moored in the river. To the east a sand beach and waterfront esplanade provides a popular walk to Silverknowes and Granton. On the other side of the Almond, (once accessible by a rowing-boat ferry) the Dalmeny Estate has a pleasant walk through Dalmeny Woods along the shore of the Firth of Forth. A rare example of a morthouse is located in the Church of Scotland churchyard. Near the kirk stands the imposing Cramond House. Its central part is late 17th century, with classical front added in 1778 and back in 1820. Queen Victoria visited while residing at Holyrood. It has been claimed as a possible original of R. L. Stevenson‚Äôs \\"House of Shaws\\" in Kidnapped. It is now owned by Trustees of the Church of Scotland and until 2010 was used as the headquarters of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The Trust relocated to Leith. The Manse dates originally from the mid-17th century and was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The north wing was added about 1770 and a south wing in 1857. Reverend Walker, the skating minister in Raeburn's famous portrait, lived here from 1776 to 1784. Offshore, Cramond Island has WW II fortifications and is linked to land by a causeway with a line of concrete pylons on one side, constructed as an anti shipping barrier. At certain low tides sand extends to the island, tempting visitors to visit the island, though occasionally some are stranded by the incoming tide.  Cramond in fiction  For many people Cramond is associated with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, where Mr. Lowther has his home and Miss Brodie spends much of her time. Cramond is also where the House of Shaws is located in Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped. Cramond is also mentioned in Ian Rankin's Fleshmarket Close. Cramond features briefly in a series 2 episode of the Paul Temple (TV series) called 'Double Vision' filmed in 1970. More recently Cramond featured in Young Sherlock Holmes: Fire Storm.

Philippe Desports (1546-1606) Volume 62 of Actes et colloques. Editor, Contributor, Jean Balsamo. Publisher, Klincksieck, 2000 Biography Philippe Desportes was born in Chartres. While serving as secretary to the Bishop of Le Puy he visited Italy, where he learned Italian poetry. This experience became a good account. On his return to France he attached himself to the duke of Anjou, and followed him to Cracow on his election as king of Poland. Nine months in Poland satisfied the civilized Desportes, but in 1574 his patron became king of France as Henry III. He showered favours on the poet, who received, in reward for the skill with which he wrote occasional poems at the royal request, the abbey of Tiron and four other valuable benefices. A good example of the light and dainty verse in which Desportes excelled is furnished by the well-known villanelle with the refrain \\"Qui premier s'en repentira\\", which was on the lips of Henry, duke of Guise, just before his death. Desportes was above all an imitator. He imitated Petrarch, Ariosto, Sannazaro, and still more closely the minor Italian poets, and in 1604 a number of his plagiarisms were exposed in the Rencontres des Muses de France et d'Italie. As a sonneteer he showed much grace and sweetness, and English poets borrowed freely from him. In his old age Desportes acknowledged his ecclesiastical preferment by a translation of the Psalms remembered chiefly for the brutal mot of Malherbe: \\"Votre potage vaut mieux que vos psaumes.\\" He published in 1573 an edition of his works including Diane, Les Amours d'Hippolyte, Elegies, Bergeries, ≈íuvres chr√™tiennes, etc. An edition of his ≈íuvres, by Alfred Michiels, appeared in 1858.

It was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1905 and now consists of a number of products. Every product in the Dairy Milk line is made with exclusively milk chocolate. In 2014, Dairy Milk was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar in the UK.\\"Top 10 selling chocolate bars in the UK\\". Wales Online. Retrieved 28 December 2014 It is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company in the United States under licence from Cadbury. History  Cadbury chocolate bars (Dairy Milk back of tray), circa 1910 In June 1905 in Birmingham, England, Cadbury made its first Dairy Milk bar, with a higher proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars, and it became the company's best-selling product by 1914. George Cadbury Junior, responsible for the development of the bar, has said \\"All sorts of names were suggested: Highland Milk, Jersey and Dairy Maid. But when a customer's daughter suggested Dairy Milk, the name stuck.\\" Fruit and Nut was introduced as part of the Dairy Milk line in 1926, soon followed by Whole Nut in 1930. By this point, Cadbury's was the brand leader in the United Kingdom. In 1928, Cadbury's introduced the \\"glass and a half\\" slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk bar, to advertise the bar's higher milk content.begins in Cadbury Dairy Milk ads . Cadbury plc website. Accessed 30 May 2010. In September 2012, Cadbury made the decision to change the shape of the bar chunks to a more circular shape in order to reduce the weight. The bar had not seen such a significant change in shape since 1905. Since 2007 Cadbury, has had a trademark in the United Kingdom for the distinctive purple colour (Pantone 2865C) of its chocolate bar wrappers, originally introduced in 1914 as a tribute to Queen Victoria. In October 2013, however, an appeal by Nestl√© succeeded in overturning that court ruling. In July 2018, Cadbury announced it would launch a new Dairy Milk version with 30% less sugar. The chief nutritionist of Public Health England, Alison Tedstone, said she was \\"pleased that Mondelez is the latest ‚Ä¶ name\\" to offer \\"healthier\\" products. Bars Cadbury Dairy Milk Bubbly The original Dairy Milk bar (\\"with a glass and a half of fresh milk\\") was launched in 1905. Variant bars include Caramel, \\"Fruit & Nut\\" (a bar with raisins and almonds), \\"Whole Nut\\" (with hazelnuts), \\"Dairy Milk Silk\\" and a bar with a Turkish delight centre. Dairy Milk Ritz, a bar with salty Ritz crackers was launched in the United Kingdom in 2014. Alongside this new bar, Dairy Milk with LU biscuits was also launched. A Vegemite flavored bar, which consists of milk chocolate, caramel, and Vegemite (5%), was launched in Australia in 2015. In 1986 the glass and a half symbol appeared on the front of the Irish Dairy Milk wrapper. Ingredients and tastes for local markets According to a 2007 report in The New York Times, a British bar contained (in order) milk, sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, vegetable fat and emulsifiers, whilst the American version manufactured by Hershey started its list of ingredients with sugar. It also listed lactose, emulsifier soy lecithin, and \\"natural and artificial flavorings\\". Cadbury supplied its chocolate crumb to Hershey, which then added cocoa butter during processing. According to its spokesman, Cadbury tries to adapt the taste of the product to that which local consumers are accustomed, meaning more akin to a Hershey bar for the US market. There is a variation of taste between the UK Cadbury-produced products and the equivalents produced by Irish Cadbury; the same can be said for locally produced Cadbury products elsewhere in the world. Advertising =Pre-2007 advertising= In Ireland Cadbury Dairy Milk used the jingle \\"The Perfect Word For Chocolate\\" (1986-1988) between (1989-1996) the popular jingle \\"The Choice Is Yours The Taste Is Cadbury\\" with the \\"Mysteries of Love\\" was a popular advert through them years. The song Show Me Heaven used in 1996 advert with the jingle \\"Tastes Like Heaven\\". A museum display of tins of Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate Cadbury has always tried to keep a strong association with milk, with slogans such as \\"a glass and a half of full cream milk in every half pound\\" and advertisements that feature a glass of milk pouring out and forming the bar. In 2004, Cadbury started a series of television advertisements in the United Kingdom and Ireland featuring a human and an animal (representing the human's happiness) debating whether to eat one of a range of included bars. =Glass and a Half Full Productions (2007‚Äì2011)= In 2007, Cadbury launched a new advertising campaign entitled Gorilla, from a new in-house production company called \\"Glass And A Half Full Productions\\". The advert was premi√®red during the season finale of Big Brother 2007, and consists of a gorilla at a drum kit, drumming along to the Phil Collins song \\"In the Air Tonight\\". The advert has over twenty million views on YouTube, and put the Phil Collins song back into the UK charts. On 28 March 2008, the second Dairy Milk advert produced by Glass and a Half Full Productions aired. The ad, entitled 'Trucks' features several trucks at night on an empty runway at an airport racing to the tune of Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\". The ad campaign ran at the same time as the problems at Heathrow Terminal 5 with baggage handling; in the advert baggage was scattered across the runway. On 5 September 2008, the Gorilla advert was relaunched with a new soundtrack ‚Äì Bonnie Tyler's \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" ‚Äì a reference to online mash-ups of the commercial. Similarly, a version of the truck advert appeared, using Bon Jovi's song \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\". Both remakes premiered once again during the finale of Big Brother 2008. In January 2009, 'Eyebrows', the third advert in the series, was released, of two children moving their eyebrows up and down rapidly to a set electro-funk beat: \\"Don't Stop the Rock\\" featuring Leah McArdle and Bradley Ford. Freestyle. In April 2010, a fourth advert aired, entitled 'Chocolate Charmer', containing a scientist mixing milk and chocolate to make a dairy milk bar to the tune of \\"The Only One I Know\\" by The Charlatans. This was different from the others in that it did not feature the 'A Glass and a Half Full Production' title card at the start. In April 2011, a fifth advert aired, known as 'Charity Shop' or 'Dancing Clothes', featuring dancing clothes at a charity shop to the tune of \\"We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off\\" by Jermaine Stewart. This exposed the song to a new generation who downloaded the track and returned the song to the UK Top 40 so far reaching no. 29. This advert marked the return of the Glass and a Half Full title card. =Glass and a Half Full Records= A new 'record label' was launched as part of the Glass and a Half Full Productions campaign. The first song released was Zingolo featuring Tinny, to promote Fairtrade Dairy Milk. A full music video was made incorporating the 60-second ads, as well as a Facebook page. =Joyville (2012‚Äìpresent)= The 2012 campaign focuses on an 'organisation made to bring joy to people'. Chocolate fountains were put in shopping centres such as Westfield London and the first ad focused on the relaunch of Dairy Milk Bubbly. During the campaign in 2012, Cadbury Dairy Milk was launched in new flavours such as Toffee Popcorn, Golden Biscuit Crunch (an exclusive to Sainsbury's), Nutty Caramel and also Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo. Along with the new flavours, Cadbury also launched two new Bubbly bars including a mini version and a Mint Bubbly. Cadbury has also launched Crispello and, most recently, launched \\"Marvellous Creations\\" in the UK. In addition, Cadbury also brought the Joyville concept into Asia where Singapore Bloggers were invited to join in and spread the love. In 2014, Joyville was replaced with the \\"Free The Joy\\" campaign. The song in a television advert is \\"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie\\" by Baccara. A new design was launched for Dairy Milk (and its variants) inviting consumers to scan an on- pack QR code and visit a website featuring \\"Free The Joy\\" moments. = Marketing in India = Cadburys Chocolate in refrigerated display at a store in Coimbatore, India Cadbury has enjoyed a substantial fan base in India. The Dairy Milk primarily is a huge success. Initially, the company had appointed Amitabh Bachchan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However the brand soon faced a significant backlash with worms being spotted in a few of the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns however the company recovered again with increased sales. Cadbury is known for its marketing campaigns in India that have known to instill a sense of playfulness and innocence with its campaigns. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country's love for cricket was very successful. The advert is noted to be the best advertisement made in India by The Times of India. Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the 'Shubh Aarambh' Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having something sweet before every auspicious occasion. It is a traditional belief that this leads to a favourable outcome for the people. This campaign was successful and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country. Grey imports In 2015, Hershey's blocked imports of overseas-made Cadbury chocolate and other confectionery to the US that infringed on its trademark licensing in a settlement with a grey importer. British Dairy Milk has been blind taste-tested as providing a creamier taste and texture, with the Hershey's-made chocolate reportedly leaving a less pleasing coating on the tongue and a somewhat stale aftertaste. Recalls Cadbury was fined in July 2007 due to its products having been found to have been at risk of infection with salmonella (at a factory in Marlbrook, Herefordshire, England). It spent a further ¬£30 million decontaminating the factory. On 14 September 2007, Cadbury Schweppes investigated a manufacturing error over allergy warnings, recalling for the second time in two years thousands of chocolate bars. A printing mistake at the Keynsham factory resulted in the omission of nut allergy labels from 250g Dairy Milk Double Chocolate bars. The 2008 Chinese milk scandal affected Cadbury, when much of the Cadbury Dairy Milk manufactured in mainland China was tainted with melamine. Although it can be safely used in plastic manufacturing, melamine is toxic, particularly to infants. Ruwitch, John (5 October 2008). \\"Hong Kong finds melamine in two Cadbury products\\". Reuters. Retrieved 5 October 2008. Reuters In 2003 worms were found in the chocolate bars in India. Widespread outrage brought by the state media halted production for a few days. Amitabh Bachchan, who was then the Brand ambassador, was also not spared.

Some other countries have taxes with a more or less comparable role, like France's taxe d'habitation. Rates by country =Australia= Local government authorities levy annual taxes, which are called council rates or shire rates. The basis on which these charges can be calculated varies from state to state, but is usually based in some way on the value of property. Even within states, individual local government authorities can often choose the specific basis of rates ‚Äì for example, it may be on the rental value of houses (as in Western Australia) or on the unimproved land value (as in New South Wales). These rateable valuations are usually determined by a statutory authority, and are subject to periodic revision. =Canada= Rates are referred to as property taxes in Canada. These taxes are collected primarily by municipal governments on residential, industrial and commercial properties and are their main source of funding. =Hong Kong= Levied on domestic property as well as non-domestic premises. Prior to 2000, it was used to fund municipal services, the responsibility of the now- abolished Urban Council and Regional Council, through the Urban Services Department and Regional Services Department. The revenue now goes to the Treasury. The bill is issued quarterly. =Ireland= Business rates and domestic rates existed in Ireland as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and were retained after independence. Business or commercial rates are still collected. Fianna F√°il promised to abolish domestic rates in its 1977 general election manifesto, won a landslide, and implemented this with effect from 1979.; Local authorities lost 33% of their budget and made cutbacks. From the mid 1980s until 1997, most levied \\"water charges\\" to make up part of the shortfall. In 2013 a Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced, which has been compared to the reintroduction of domestic rates; one difference is that LPT is collected centrally by the Revenue Commissioners before being disbursed to the local authorities. =Israel= Israel has a similar tax known as arnona that goes back to the days of the British Mandate of Palestine. It is levied by the municipality (or, in smaller localities, by the moatza azorit, i.e., Regional Council) based (currently) on the square meterage of dwelling or business. Specific rates vary widely among municipalities, with Jerusalem and Rehovot having the highest rates in the country. In rental dwellings, tenants (rather than owners) generally pay the arnona. Single parents and some forms of economic hardship qualify for discounts or even exemptions. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, rates have provided the major source of revenue for territorial authorities since the late-19th century. Rates are basically a tax on real-estate property. , rates made up 56% of local-authority operating-revenue.See http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/ArcAggregator/arcView/frameView/IE12126512/http://www.dia.govt.nz/Agency- Independent-Inquiry-into-Local-Government-Rates-Index at page 8 Almost all property owners in New Zealand pay rates; those who do so are referred to as ratepayers. People who rent property do not pay rates directly, but property owners will take account of the cost of rates when they set the rent. As a result, those who rent properties also have an interest in the level of rates, as well as in the services provided by councils using these rates. Some types of property are exempt from rate levies - government land and rail land, for example. Other categories of property may possibly only be rated at 50% (land used for some types of sports purposes). MƒÅori land - particularly where ownership and therefore liability for rates are hard to establish - can also get special treatment. Exceptions are listed in Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002.See http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0006/latest/DLM133512.html Territorial authorities may assess property values in three different ways ‚Äì on the basis of land, annual or capital value ‚Äì using valuations prepared in accordance with the Rating Valuations Act 1998. The valuation process is overseen by the Valuer-General. Each local authority, after consulting with their community, can decide which basis to use.See, for example, the discussion/explanation on page 9 of http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/ArcAggregator/arcView/frameView/IE12126512/http://www.dia.govt.nz/Agency- Independent-Inquiry-into-Local-Government-Rates-Index Councils can use a mix of these different methodologies when assessing rates based on the value of holdings, for example land value for its general rate and capital value for a targeted rate. Councils can also levy flat charges per rating unit (i.e. each lot of land, with some exceptions where multiple adjacent lots may be considered one rating unit if in common ownership, or where multiple dwelling- units are on a single lot) - generally called a uniform annual general charge. Other methodologies also exist, such as a charge per toilet bowl or urinal, or a water charge per cubic metre of water supplied. The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 See http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0006/latest/DLM131394.html? for the most recent reprint of the Act is the governing legislation and provides a number of options for setting rates, such that local authorities can use combinations of general rates, targeted rates and/or uniform annual general charges. =United Kingdom= Rates in the United Kingdom are a tax on property used to provide some of the funding of local government. Domestic rates, split into regional and district rates, are currently collected in Northern Ireland. They were collected in England and Wales before 1990 and in Scotland before 1989. Outside Northern Ireland Council Tax is collected instead of domestic rates. Business rates are collected throughout the United Kingdom, with different systems in England and Wales, in Northern Ireland and in Scotland. =United States= In the US, real estate taxes which are based on a percentage of the property's actual or nominal value are referred to as \\"property taxes\\". The term \\"rates\\" is not used in this context. Property taxes are the prime funding method for local government, and are normally the responsibility of the property owner, regardless of whether the property owner lives on the property.

A charg√© d'affaires (), often shortened to charg√© (French) and sometimes to charge-D (abbreviated in colloquial English), is a diplomat who served as an embassy's Chief of mission in the absence of the ambassador. The term is French for \\"charged with (in charge of) matters\\". A female diplomat may be designated a charg√©e d'affaires, following French declension. A charg√© enjoys the same privileges and immunities as a regular ambassador. Similarly to ambassadors, charg√© d'affaires may be addressed as His or Her Excellency. However, charg√©s d'affaires are outranked by ambassadors and have lower precedence at formal diplomatic events. In most cases, a diplomat would only serve as a charg√© d'affaires on a temporary basis in the absence of the ambassador. In unusual situations, a charg√© d'affaires may be appointed for an indefinite period, in cases where disputes between the two countries make it impossible or undesirable to send agents of a higher diplomatic rank. Types of charg√©s Charg√©s d'affaires ad interim (\\"a.i.\\") are those who temporarily head a diplomatic mission in the absence of the accredited head of that mission. It is usual to appoint a minister-counsellor, counsellor or secretary of embassy to be charg√© d'affaires ad interim, and that person is presented to the foreign minister of the receiving state. By definition, Charg√©s d'affaires ad interim do not possess diplomatic credentials. Charg√©s d'affaires en pied (\\"e.p.\\") are appointed to be permanent heads of mission, in cases where the two countries lack ambassadorial-level relations. They are appointed by letters of credence from the foreign minister of the sending state to the foreign minister of the receiving state. Charg√©s d'affaires en pied have precedence over charg√©s d'affaires ad interim, but are outranked by ambassadors. They are sometimes referred to as charg√©s d'affaires ad hoc or en titre. Long-term charg√©-level relations In certain cases, a charg√© d'affaires may be appointed for long periods, such as when a mission is headed by a non-resident ambassador who is accredited to multiple countries. In addition, a mission may be downgraded from an ambassadorial to a charg√© d'affaires level to show displeasure, yet avoid taking the extremely serious step of breaking diplomatic relations. For example, Saudi Arabia and Thailand have not exchanged ambassadors since 1989, due to the still-unresolved Blue Diamond Affair. Sometimes when diplomatic recognition is extended to a new government, a charg√© may be sent to immediately establish diplomatic representation. However, if a timely exchange of ambassadors does not take place, this may result in a prolonged period of charg√©-level relations. For example, the United Kingdom recognized the People's Republic of China in 1950 and posted a charg√© d'affaires in the new capital of Beijing. However, China was unwilling to exchange ambassadors until the United Kingdom withdrew its consulate from Taipei. Sino-British relations were not upgraded to the ambassadorial level until 1972. Since a charg√© d'affaires presents his or her credentials to the foreign minister rather than the head of state, the appointment of a charg√© may avoid a politically sensitive meeting that would imply approval or recognition of that head of state or government. Similarly, the receiving country may decline to receive an ambassador, but still maintain diplomatic relations by accepting a charg√©. For example, the Republic of Cyprus appoints a number of charg√©s d'affaires en pied to its embassies abroad. History In modern use, charg√©s d'affaires essentially differ from ambassadors in that, like all diplomats, charg√©s represent their nation, but unlike an Ambassador, they are not personal representatives of their Head of State. Apart from rank and precedence, Charg√©s enjoy the same privileges and immunities as other diplomatic agents. However, there have been rare historical circumstances in which the title charg√© d'affaires was in fact employed in a more significant colonial role, as commonly held by a resident. Thus, in Annam-Tonkin (most of present Vietnam), the first French charg√© d'affaires at Hu·∫ø, the local ruler's capital, since 1875; one of them (three terms) was appointed the first resident-general on 11 June 1884, as they stopped being tributary to the Chinese Empire, less than a year after the 25 August 1883 French protectorates over Annam and Tonkin (central and northern regions). In French usage, charg√© d'affaires may be used outside diplomacy either as a specific position, or in general terms to indicate an individual with some more or less temporary responsibility for a specific area of activity. Spelling and grammar Charg√© d'affaires generally follows French usage: charg√© d'affaires is singular, charg√©s d'affaires for plural. The \\"d'affaires\\" is always in the plural form, and should be lowercase even if Charg√© is capitalized. Following the French declension, charg√©e d'affaires (with the feminine ending) may be seen where the charg√© is female. For temporary charg√©s, ad interim may or may not be added depending on the context, but is always lower case; it may be italicized or shortened to simply a.i.

Surrounded by rolling hills and mountains covered with thick rain forest, the lake has an area of , with an elevation of approximately . Barangays Lake Sebu is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. =Climate= Demographics The lake's shores and the surrounding rainforest are home to the indigenous T'bolis, Tirurays, Ubos and Manobos. One of the major tribes, the T'bolis are known for their weaving skills and brassware production as well as fishing skills. The rest of the population are made of Ilonggos, Bicolanos and Ilocanos. Economy The economy is based on aquaculture of Tilapia grown in large fish cages floating in the lake. More than one half of the land around the lake is cultivated for agriculture. The Philippine government is also trying to promote ecotourism in the area. The finishing of a concrete road cut the travel time from 4 hours to less than 30 minutes greatly improving trade and commerce.  Wildlife  Wild boars and Philippine Deer which are considered endangered live around the lake. The lake and the surrounding rainforest are natural habitat to egrets, kingfishers, swallows, herons, Philippine cockatoos and kites.  Environmental conservation  The Philippine government proclaimed a area as a protected landscape. On the south-eastern watershed of the lake, a bamboo plantation was established.

Sightings 17-year-old William \\"Bill\\" Bartlett claimed that while driving on April 21, 1977, he saw a large-eyed creature \\"with tendril-like fingers\\" and glowing eyes on top of a broken stone wall on Farm Street in Dover, Massachusetts. 15-year-old John Baxter reported seeing a similar creature on Miller Hill Road the same evening. Another 15-year-old, Abby Brabham, claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue. The teenagers all drew sketches of the alleged creature. Bartlett wrote on his sketch, \\"I, Bill Bartlett, swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw this creature.\\" According to the Boston Globe, \\"the locations of the sightings, plotted on a map, lay in a straight line over 2 miles\\". Some suggested that the creature may have been a foal or a moose calf.

He was an elder half-brother of Empress He, the empress consort of Emperor Ling, and a maternal uncle of Emperor Shao. In 189, he and his sister shared power as regents when the young Emperor Shao was put on the throne following Emperor Ling's death. During the time, the conflict between He Jin and the influential eunuch faction intensified. The eunuch faction lured He Jin into a trap in the imperial palace and assassinated him. While He Jin's subordinates slaughtered the eunuch faction in revenge, the warlord Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum to enter the imperial capital Luoyang and seize control of the Han central government. The subsequent breakdown of central command brought forth the beginning of massive civil wars which led to the end of the Han dynasty and the start of the Three Kingdoms period. Life He Jin was born into a family of butchers in Nanyang, hometown of the dynastic founder Emperor Guangwu. During the reign of Emperor Ling his younger half-sister entered the palace and soon became one of the emperor's favourites. In 180, she was made empress and He Jin henceforth began a speedy escalation up the bureaucratic ladder. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in 184, He Jin was appointed General-in-Chief (). He manned the imperial armory, secured strategic forts around the capital and moved quickly to crush the uprising at Luoyang led by Ma Yuanyi (), a follower of the rebel leader, Zhang Jue. The campaign was deemed a success and He Jin was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Shen (). After the rebellion was quelled, He Jin continued in the role of General-in-Chief, technically with control over all the imperial armies. During this time, other members of his family, such as his younger half-brother He Miao (), were also elevated to positions of importance. In 188, perhaps as a counterweight to the power of the He family, Emperor Ling created the Army of the Western Garden. The emperor ostentatiously paraded in front of the army and had himself named \\"Supreme General\\" (). The emperor also had the army placed under the command of Jian Shuo, a trusted eunuch. By commanding the Army of the Western Garden, the emperor could put He Jin under his own command. When Emperor Ling died in the early months of 189, and the stage was set for a showdown between He Jin and the eunuch faction. Jian Shuo plotted to lure He Jin into a trap in the imperial palace and assassinate him. When He Jin entered, a minor official Pan Yin () subtly warned He Jin about Jian Shuo's plot. Astonished, He Jin returned to his camp and evaded the assassination attempt. Afterwards, He Jin had Jian Shuo arrested and executed. He also seized command of the troops previously under Jian Shuo's command. With the support of the elite Yuan family, particularly Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, the succession dispute was resolved in favour of Liu Bian, the son of Empress He, who ascended the throne in the fifth month of that year. He Jin and his sister, now the Empress Dowager, jointly took on the role of regent. During the summer months, He Jin and his subordinates engaged the eunuch faction in court politics. The eunuchs, now without a military power base of their own, relied on the support of Empress Dowager He and He Miao. At the urging of Yuan Shao, He Jin summoned the general Dong Zhuo to the outskirts of Luoyang, in an attempt to force the Empress Dowager to back down. In the ninth month of that year, He Jin entered the palace to request the Empress Dowager to agree to the execution of the eunuchs. Zhang Rang, the leader of the eunuch faction, found out about He Jin's plan to kill them through a spy who overheard the conversation between He Jin and the Empress Dowager. The eunuchs then lured He Jin into the imperial palace by pretending to summon him in the name of the Empress Dowager. He Jin entered the palace unsuspectingly, without his subordinates and bodyguards to escort him, and met his end at the hands of the eunuchs. The situation soon spun out of control. Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, both with significant control of military forces within the capital, stormed the palace and massacred the eunuchs. The resulting power vacuum allowed Dong Zhuo to seize control of the imperial court. As soon as he held supremacy over the capital, Dong Zhuo deposed the emperor in favour of the Prince of Chenliu, who came to be known as Emperor Xian. The deposition as well as Dong Zhuo's subsequent atrocities incurred the wrath of many. In 190, warlords from the eastern provinces formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, which kicked off a series of civil wars that were to last for nearly a century. Family He Jin had at least three half-siblings: * Empress He, the empress consort of Emperor Ling and mother of Emperor Shao * Lady He, full sister of Empress He, married the adopted son of the eunuch Zhang Rang * He Miao (), courtesy name Shuda (), born Zhu Miao (), an elder half-brother of Empress He born by the same mother thus actually not blood-related to He Jin. He served as General of Chariots and Cavalry (), killed by He Jin's subordinate Wu Kuang () in 189 for sympathizing with the eunuch faction who assassinated He Jin According to historical sources it is widely believed that He Jin had at least one son, He Xian (), who survived the downfall of the He family in 189, and that He Xian had a son, He Yan ( 196‚Äì249). As He Xian died early, his wife Lady Yin () remarried and became a concubine of the warlord Cao Cao, who adopted He Yan as a son. However, He Yan was buried at Lujiang when one's place of burial was customarily supposed to be his ancestral home, which contradicted the fact that He Jin was from Nanyang; so He Yan was probably a grandson of He Miao, as what Weilue suggested, while it was recorded that there had actually been several families of Zhu clan, which might be the clan that He Miao was from, at Lujiang during Eastern Han.

She was the second empress consort of Emperor Ling and the mother of Emperor Shao. After the death of Emperor Ling in 189, she became empress dowager when her young son, Liu Bian (Emperor Shao), became the new emperor. She was caught up in the conflict between her brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and the eunuch faction, who were both vying for power in the Han imperial court. After He Jin's assassination and the elimination of the eunuch faction, the warlord Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum to lead his forces into the imperial capital and seize control of the Han central government. He subsequently deposed Emperor Shao, replaced him with Liu Xie (Emperor Xian), and had Empress Dowager He poisoned to death. Family background and early years Lady He was from Wan County (), Nanyang Commandery (), which is in present-day Nanyang, Henan.

She was seven chi and one cun tall. In 176, she bore Emperor Ling a son, Liu Bian, who turned out to be the emperor's oldest surviving son because his other sons born before Liu Bian died in infancy or childhood.

Around the time, one of Emperor Ling's consorts, Beautiful Lady Wang (), became pregnant. As she feared that Empress He would harm her unborn child, she attempted to cause a miscarriage by consuming drugs but her child remained safe and she had dreams about the sun. In 181, after Beautiful Lady Wang gave birth to a son, Liu Xie, Empress He ordered her to be poisoned to death. Emperor Ling was furious when he found out and he wanted to depose Empress He, but the eunuchs managed to persuade him to spare the empress. The motherless Liu Xie was raised by his grandmother, Empress Dowager Dong, and given the title \\"Marquis Dong\\" ().(ÊôÇÁéãÁæé‰∫∫‰ªªÂ®†ÔºåÁïèÂêéÔºå‰πÉÊúçËó•Ê¨≤Èô§‰πãÔºåËÄåËÉéÂÆâ‰∏çÂãïÔºåÂèàÊï∏Â§¢Ë≤†Êó•ËÄåË°å„ÄÇÂõõÂπ¥ÔºåÁîüÁöáÂ≠êÊÅäÔºåÂêéÈÅÇÈÖñÊÆ∫Áæé‰∫∫„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂ§ßÊÄíÔºåÊ¨≤Âª¢ÂêéÔºåË´∏ÂÆ¶ÂÆòÂõ∫Ë´ãÂæóÊ≠¢„ÄÇËë£Â§™ÂêéËá™È§äÂçîÔºåËôüÊõ∞Ëë£‰æØ„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 10 (Part 2). When his subjects asked him to name one of his sons as crown prince, Emperor Ling had a dilemma between Liu Bian and Liu Xie, his only two surviving sons. He felt that Liu Bian was unfit to be emperor because he was frivolous and unable to command respect, so he preferred Liu Xie. However, he was also worried that if he chose Liu Xie, Empress He would turn to her half-brother, He Jin, for help. He Jin held the position of General-in-Chief () and was a highly influential figure in the imperial court.

As empress dowager When Emperor Ling became critically ill in 189, he secretly entrusted his eight-year-old son Liu Xie to close aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon Emperor Ling's death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. However, Pan Yin (), a eunuch who was also an acquaintance of He Jin, warned the General-in-Chief of Jian Shuo's plot. He Jin returned to his military camp and pretended to be sick so he did not need to respond when summoned to enter the palace. Jian Shuo's plan to make Liu Xie emperor failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor's mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei () served as his regents.(ÂÖ≠Âπ¥ÔºåÂ∏ùÁñæÁØ§ÔºåÂ±¨ÂçîÊñºËπáÁ¢©„ÄÇÁ¢©Êó£ÂèóÈÅ∫Ë©îÔºå‰∏îÁ¥†ËºïÂøåÊñºÈÄ≤ÂÖÑÂºüÔºåÂèäÂ∏ùÂ¥©ÔºåÁ¢©ÊôÇÂú®ÂÖßÔºåÊ¨≤ÂÖàË™ÖÈÄ≤ËÄåÁ´ãÂçî„ÄÇÂèäÈÄ≤ÂæûÂ§ñÂÖ•ÔºåÁ¢©Âè∏È¶¨ÊΩòÈö±ËàáÈÄ≤Êó©ËàäÔºåËøéËÄåÁõÆ‰πã„ÄÇÈÄ≤È©öÔºåÈ¶≥ÂæûÂÑ≥ÈÅìÊ≠∏ÁáüÔºåÂºïÂÖµÂÖ•Â±ØÁôæÈÉ°ÈÇ∏ÔºåÂõ†Á®±Áñæ‰∏çÂÖ•„ÄÇÁ¢©Ë¨Ä‰∏çË°åÔºåÁöáÂ≠êËæØ‰πÉÂç≥‰ΩçÔºå‰ΩïÂ§™ÂêéËá®ÊúùÔºåÈÄ≤ËàáÂ§™ÂÇÖË¢ÅÈöóËºîÊîøÔºåÈåÑÂ∞öÊõ∏‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 69.(‰∏≠Âπ≥ÂÖ≠Âπ¥ÔºåÂ∏ùÂ¥©ÔºåÁöáÂ≠êËæØÂç≥‰ΩçÔºåÂ∞äÂêéÁÇ∫ÁöáÂ§™Âêé„ÄÇÂ§™ÂêéËá®Êúù„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 10 (Part 2).

Empress Dowager He immediately rejected the idea because it required her to interact with men on a regular basis, which she found offensive and immodest. Empress Dowager He's mother (the Lady of Wuyang) and He Miao () had been bribed by the eunuchs to protect them, so they also strongly opposed He Jin's plan, saying that they owed much to the eunuchs.

He Jin fell into an ambush and died at the hands of the eunuchs, who declared him guilty of treason.(ÂÖ´ÊúàÔºåÈÄ≤ÂÖ•Èï∑Ê®ÇÁôΩÂ§™ÂêéÔºåË´ãÁõ°Ë™ÖË´∏Â∏∏‰æç‰ª•‰∏ãÔºåÈÅ∏‰∏âÁΩ≤ÈÉéÂÖ•ÂÆàÂÆ¶ÂÆòÂª¨„ÄÇË´∏ÂÆ¶ÂÆòÁõ∏Ë¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÁ®±Áñæ‰∏çËá®Âñ™Ôºå‰∏çÈÄÅËë¨Ôºå‰ªäÊ¨ªÂÖ•ÁúÅÔºåÊ≠§ÊÑè‰ΩïÁÇ∫ÔºüÁ´áÊ∞è‰∫ãÁ´üÂæ©Ëµ∑ÈÇ™Ôºü„ÄçÂèàÂºµËÆìÁ≠â‰Ωø‰∫∫ÊΩõËÅΩÔºåÂÖ∑ËÅûÂÖ∂Ë™ûÔºå‰πÉÁéáÂ∏∏‰æçÊÆµÁè™„ÄÅÁï¢ÂµêÁ≠âÊï∏ÂçÅ‰∫∫ÔºåÊåÅÂÖµÁ´äËá™ÂÅ¥Èó•ÂÖ•Ôºå‰ºèÁúÅ‰∏≠„ÄÇÂèäÈÄ≤Âá∫ÔºåÂõ†Ë©ê‰ª•Â§™ÂêéË©îÂè¨ÈÄ≤„ÄÇÂÖ•ÂùêÁúÅÈó•ÔºåËÆìÁ≠âË©∞ÈÄ≤Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§©‰∏ãÊÜíÊÜíÔºå‰∫¶ÈùûÁç®ÊàëÊõπÁΩ™‰πü„ÄÇÂÖàÂ∏ùÁîûËàáÂ§™Âêé‰∏çÂø´ÔºåÂπæËá≥ÊàêÊïóÔºåÊàëÊõπÊ∂ïÊ≥£ÊïëËß£ÔºåÂêÑÂá∫ÂÆ∂Ë≤°ÂçÉËê¨ÁÇ∫Á¶ÆÔºåÂíåÊÅ±‰∏äÊÑèÔºå‰ΩÜÊ¨≤Ë®óÂçøÈñÄÊà∂ËÄ≥„ÄÇ‰ªä‰πÉÊ¨≤ÊªÖÊàëÊõπÁ®ÆÊóèÔºå‰∏ç‰∫¶Â§™Áîö‰πéÔºüÂçøË®ÄÁúÅÂÖßÁ©¢ÊøÅÔºåÂÖ¨Âçø‰ª•‰∏ãÂø†Ê∏ÖËÄÖÁÇ∫Ë™∞Ôºü„ÄçÊñºÊòØÂ∞öÊñπÁõ£Ê∏†Á©ÜÊãîÂäîÊñ¨ÈÄ≤ÊñºÂòâÂæ∑ÊÆøÂâç„ÄÇËÆì„ÄÅÁè™Á≠âÁÇ∫Ë©îÔºå‰ª•ÊïÖÂ§™Â∞âÊ®äÈôµÁÇ∫Âè∏Èö∑Ê†°Â∞âÔºåÂ∞ëÂ∫úË®±Áõ∏ÁÇ∫Ê≤≥ÂçóÂ∞π„ÄÇÂ∞öÊõ∏ÂæóË©îÊùøÔºåÁñë‰πãÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË´ãÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂá∫ÂÖ±Ë≠∞„ÄÇ„Äç‰∏≠ÈªÉÈñÄ‰ª•ÈÄ≤È†≠Êì≤ËàáÂ∞öÊõ∏ÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ΩïÈÄ≤Ë¨ÄÂèçÔºåÂ∑≤‰ºèË™ÖÁü£„ÄÇ„Äç) Houhanshu vol. 69. After He Jin's death, his subordinates Wu Kuang () and Zhang Zhang (), along with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and others, led their troops to storm the palace and kill the eunuchs in revenge. They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone who looked like a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped their pants in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Empress Dowager He, Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) hostage and tried to flee from the palace.

Dong Zhuo subsequently relocated Empress Dowager He to Yong'an Palace () and had her poisoned to death there. He also killed the empress dowager's mother, the Lady of Wuyang (). Dong Zhuo then forced Emperor Xian to attend the empress dowager's funeral at Fengchang Village (), a district of Luoyang. The officials who attended the funeral were dressed in plain colours but not proper mourning attire; the entire ceremony did not befit her status as an empress dowager.

Greatest Sewer) was one of the world's earliest sewage systems. Constructed in Ancient Rome in order to drain local marshes and remove the waste of one of the world's most populous cities, it carried effluent to the River Tiber, which ran beside the city.Aldrete, Gregory S. (2004). Daily life in the Roman city: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia. Greenwood Publishing Group. , pp.34-35. Construction According to tradition, it may have been initially constructed around 600 BC under the orders of the king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus.Waters of Rome Journal - 4 - Hopkins.indd The Cloaca Maxima originally was built by the Etruscans as an open-air canal. Over time, the Romans covered over the canal and expanded it into a sewer system for the city.Hopkins, John N. N. \\"The Cloaca Maxima and the Monumental Manipulation of water in Archaic Rome\\". Institute of the Advanced Technology in the Humanities. Web. 4/8/12 Underground work is said to have been carried out on the sewer by Tarquinius Superbus, Rome's seventh and last king.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.56 From other writings and from the path that it takes, it may have started life as an open drain, formed from streams from three of the neighbouring hills, that were channelled through the main Forum and then on to the Tiber. This open drain would then have been gradually built over, as building space within the city became more valuable. It is possible that both theories are correct, and certainly some of the main lower parts of the system suggest that they would have been below ground level even at the time of the supposed construction. Pliny the Elder, writing in the late 1st century, describes the early Cloaca Maxima as \\"large enough to allow the passage of a wagon loaded with hay\\". The eleven aqueducts which supplied water to Rome by the 1st century AD were finally channelled into the sewers after having supplied the many public baths such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Trajan, the public fountains, imperial palaces and private houses.Woods, Michael (2000). Ancient medicine: from sorcery to surgery. Twenty-First Century Books. , p.81.Lan√ßon, Bertrand (2000). Rome in late antiquity: everyday life and urban change, AD 312-609. Routledge. , p.13. The continuous supply of running water helped to remove wastes and keep the sewers clear of obstructions. The best waters were reserved for potable drinking supplies, and the second quality waters would be used by the baths, the outfalls of which connected to the sewer network under the streets of the city. The aqueduct system was investigated by the general Frontinus at the end of the 1st century AD, who published his report on its state directly to the emperor Nerva. Distribution system There were many branches off the main sewer, but all seemed to be 'official' drains that would have served public toilets, bath-houses and other public buildings. Private residences in Rome, even of the rich, would have relied on some sort of cess-pit arrangement for sewage. The Cloaca Maxima was well maintained throughout the life of the Roman Empire and even today drains rainwater and debris from the center of town, below the ancient Forum, Velabro and Foro Boario. In 33 BC it is known to have received an inspection and overhaul from Agrippa, and archaeology reveals several building styles and material from various ages, suggesting that the systems received regular attention. In more recent times, the remaining passages have been connected to the modern-day sewage system, mainly to cope with problems of backwash from the river. Outfall of Cloaca Maxima as it appeared in 2005 Outfall of Cloaca Maxima as it appeared in January 2019 The Cloaca Maxima was thought to be presided over by the goddess Cloacina. The Romans are recorded - the veracity of the accounts depending on the case - to have dragged the bodies of a number of people to the sewers rather than give them proper burial, among them the emperor ElagabalusHerodian, Roman History, 5.8.9http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20627618 and Saint Sebastian: the latter scene is the subject of a well-known painting by Lodovico Carracci. The outfall of the Cloaca Maxima into the River Tiber is still visible today near the bridge Ponte Rotto, and near Ponte Palatino. There is a stairway going down to it visible next to the Basilica Julia at the Forum. Some of it is also visible from the surface opposite the church of San Giorgio al Velabro. The Empire View of the Cloaca Maxima as it appeared in 1814. Oil on canvas by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg The system of Roman sewers was much imitated throughout the Roman Empire, especially when combined with copious supplies of water from Roman aqueducts. The sewer system in Eboracum--the modern-day English city of York--was especially impressive and part of it still survives.Darvill, Timothy, Stamper, Paul and Timby, Jane (2002).

The Calcomp 565 drum plotter, introduced in 1959, was one of the first computer graphics output devices sold. The computer could control in 0.01 inch increments the rotation of an 11 inch (280 mm) wide drum and the horizontal movement of a pen holder over the drum. The pen was pressed by a spring against paper scrolling across the drum. A solenoid could lift the pen off the paper. This arrangement allowed line drawings to be made under computer control. Years later Calcomp made model 563 which used a 30\\" wide drum. IBM sold the Calcomp 565 as the IBM 1627 for use with its low-end scientific computers, first the IBM 1620, and, later, the IBM 1130. It was perhaps the first non-IBM peripheral that IBM allowed to be attached to one of its computers. The paper rolls were long. A metal bar above the take-up reel allowed a finished plot to be torn off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take- up reel. The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided to turn off the motorized paper supply and take-up reels for this purpose.

It is also called the pinna (Latin for \\"wing\\" or \\"fin\\", plural pinnae), a term that is used more in zoology. Structure The diagram shows the shape and location of most of these components: * antihelix forms a 'Y' shape where the upper parts are: ** Superior crus (to the left of the fossa triangularis in the diagram) ** Inferior crus (to the right of the fossa triangularis in the diagram) * Antitragus is below the tragus * Aperture is the entrance to the ear canal * Auricular sulcus is the depression behind the ear next to the head * Concha is the hollow next to the ear canal * Conchal angle is the angle that the back of the concha makes with the side of the head * Crus of the helix is just above the tragus * Cymba conchae is the narrowest end of the concha * External auditory meatus is the ear canal * Fossa triangularis is the depression in the fork of the antihelix * Helix is the folded over outside edge of the ear * Incisura anterior auris, or intertragic incisure, or intertragal notch, is the space between the tragus and antitragus * Lobe (lobule) ‚Äì attached or free according to a classic single-gene dominance relationship * Scapha, the depression or groove between the helix and the anthelix * Tragus =Development= The developing auricle is first noticeable around the sixth week of gestation in the human fetus, developing from the auricular hillocks, which are derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches. These hillocks develop into the folds of the auricle and gradually shift upwards and backwards to their final position on the head. En route accessory auricles (also known as preauricular tags) may be left behind. The first three hillocks are derived from the 1st branchial arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. Cutaneous sensation to these areas is via the trigeminal nerve, the attendant nerve of the 1st branchial arch. The final three hillocks are derived from the second branchial arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and lobule, respectively. These portions of the ear are supplied by the cervical plexus and a small portion by the facial nerve. This explains why vesicles are classically seen on the auricle in herpes infections of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II).Moore, K. L. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriental Embryology, ninth edition. Saunders. p. 445. . The auricle's functions are to collect sound and transform it into directional and other information. The auricle collects sound and, like a funnel, amplifies the sound and directs it to the auditory canal. The filtering effect of the human pinnae preferentially selects sounds in the frequency range of human speech. =Amplification and modulation= The fennec fox uses its distinctive oversized pinnae to radiate excess heat and to amplify the sound of small prey burrowing under the desert sand Amplification of sound by the pinna, tympanic membrane and middle ear causes an increase in level of about 10 to 15 dB in a frequency range of 1.5 kHz to 7 kHz. This amplification is an important factor in inner ear trauma resulting from elevated sound levels. Non-electrical hearing apparatuses which were designed to protect hearing (particularly that of musicians and others who work in loud environments) which fit snugly in the concha have been studied by the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in the U.K. \\"Acoustic characterisation of Calmer technology prototypes\\" =Notch of pinna= Due to its anatomy, the pinna largely eliminates a small segment of the frequency spectrum; this band is called the pinna notch. The pinna works differently for low and high frequency sounds. For low frequencies, it behaves similarly to a reflector dish, directing sounds toward the ear canal. For high frequencies, however, its value is thought to be more sophisticated. While some of the sounds that enter the ear travel directly to the canal, others reflect off the contours of the pinna first: these enter the ear canal after a very slight delay. This delay causes phase cancellation, virtually eliminating the frequency component whose wave period is twice the delay period. Neighboring frequencies also drop significantly. In the affected frequency band ‚Äì the pinna notch ‚Äì the pinna creates a band-stop or notch filtering effect. This filter typically affects sounds around 10 kHz, though it can affect any frequencies from 6 ‚Äì 16 kHz. It also is directionally dependent, affecting sounds coming from above more than those coming from straight ahead. This aids in vertical sound localization. Functions To an impala, the pinna is useful in collecting sound In animals the function of the pinna is to collect sound, and perform spectral transformations to incoming sounds which enable the process of vertical localization to take place. It collects sound by acting as a funnel, amplifying the sound and directing it to the auditory canal. While reflecting from the pinna, sound also goes through a filtering process, as well as frequency dependent amplitude modulation which adds directional information to the sound (see sound localization, vertical sound localization, head-related transfer function, pinna notch). In various species, the pinna can also signal mood and radiate heat.

Troops from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) attacked United Nations Command (UN) positions on the lower Imjin River in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough and recapture the South Korean capital Seoul. The attack was part of the Chinese Spring Offensive, the aim of which was to regain the initiative on the battlefield after a series of successful UN counter-offensives in January‚ÄìMarch 1951 had allowed UN forces to establish themselves beyond the 38th Parallel at the Kansas Line. The section of the UN line where the battle took place was defended primarily by British forces of the 29th Infantry Brigade, consisting of three British and one Belgian infantry battalions (Belgian United Nations Command) supported by tanks and artillery. Despite facing a greatly numerically superior enemy, the brigade held its general positions for three days. When the units of the 29th Infantry Brigade were ultimately forced to fall back, their actions in the Battle of the Imjin River together with those of other UN forces, for example in the Battle of Kapyong, had blunted the impetus of the PVA offensive and allowed UN forces to retreat to prepared defensive positions north of Seoul, where the PVA were halted. \\"Though minor in scale, the battle's ferocity caught the imagination of the world\\",. especially the fate of the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, which was outnumbered and eventually surrounded by Chinese forces on Hill 235, a feature that became known as Gloster Hill. The stand of the Gloucestershire battalion, together with other actions of the 29th Brigade in the Battle of the Imjin River, has become an important part of British military history and tradition. Background Following the North Korean invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, a UN counter-offensive had reached the North Korean border with China. Fearing for its own security, China intervened with three offensives between October 1950 and January 1951 which pushed the UN forces south of the original border between North and South Korea along the 38th Parallel and captured Seoul. A fourth offensive in mid-February was blunted by UN forces in the Battle of Chipyong-ni and Third Battle of Wonju. At the end of February the UN launched a series of offensive operations, recapturing Seoul on 15 March and pushing the front line back northwards. In early April Operation Rugged established the front in a line that followed the lower Imjin river, then eastwards to the Hwacheon Reservoir and on to the Yangyang area on the east coast, known as the Kansas Line. The subsequent Operation Dauntless pushed out a salient between the Imjin river as it dog-legged north and the Hwacheon Reservoir, known as the Utah Line. =UN Forces= The deployment of UN forces during the initial stages of the Spring Offensive. Note the importance of 29th Brigade's position for stopping a direct advance on Seoul. On 22 April the front line in the west along Lines Kansas and Utah was held by the United States Army (US) I Corps comprising, from west to east, the South Korean Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Division, the US 3rd Division with the attached British 29th Brigade, the US 25th Division with the attached Turkish Brigade and the US 24th Division. The 29th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Tom Brodie, consisted of the 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (Glosters), under Lieutenant-Colonel James P. Carne; the 1st Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (Fusiliers), under Lieutenant-Colonel Kingsley Foster; the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles (Rifles), under the temporary command of Major Gerald Rickord; and the Belgian Battalion, under Lieutenant- Colonel Albert Crahay (700 men), to which Luxembourg's contribution to the UN forces was attached. The brigade was supported by the 25 pounders of 45 Field Regiment Royal Artillery (RA) commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel MT Young, the 4.2 inch mortars of 170 Independent Mortar Battery RA, the Centurion tanks of C Squadron 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars under the command of Major Henry Huth, and by 55 Squadron Royal Engineers. The four battalions of 29th Brigade covered a front of . Gaps between units had to be accepted because there was no possibility of forming a continuous line with the forces available. \\"Brigadier Brodie determined to deploy his men in separate unit positions, centred upon key hill features\\" On the left flank, the Glosters were guarding a ford over the Imjin east of the ROK 1st Division; the Fusiliers were deployed near the centre, around northeast of the Glosters; the Belgians, occupying a feature called Hill 194 on the right, were the only element of the 29th Brigade north of the river. Their connection with the rest of the brigade depended on two pontoon bridges about apart. These bridges connected the Belgians with Route 11, the 29th Brigade's main line of supply and communication. The Rifles served as the brigade's reserve and were deployed along Route 11. Extensive defensive preparations were not completed because the British expected to hold the position for only a short time. Neither minefields, deeply dug shelters nor extensive wire obstacles had been constructed. The British position on the Imjin river \\"was deemed safe\\" but vulnerable in case of an attack. =Chinese forces= Chinese Spring Offensive, April 1951 The commander-in-chief of the PVA and North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) forces in the Field, General Peng Dehuai, planned to \\"wipe out...the American 3rd Division...the British 29th Brigade and the 1st Division of the Puppet Army...after this we can wipe out the American 24th Division and 25th Division\\", and promised the capture of Seoul as a May Day gift to Mao Zedong. To achieve the objective Peng planned to converge on Seoul with three PVA army groups and a KPA corps; a total strength of some 305,000 men. The III and IX Army Groups were to attack the right flank of the US 3rd Division and the 24th and 25th Divisions on the Utah Line, east of the Imjin where it turned north. The XIX Army Group on the PVA right flank, west of the Imjin river where it turned north, were to attack the remainder of the 3rd Division and the ROK 1st Division. On the XIX Army Group front, the KPA I Corps and PVA 64th Army would attack the ROK 1st Division, while the 63rd Army would attack on their left, pitting it against 29th Brigade. The 63rd Army comprised three divisions, the 187th, 188th and 189th, with each division comprising three regiments, each of which comprised three battalions. Some 27,000 men in 27 battalions would be attacking 29th Brigade's four battalions, albeit in echelon, one division after the other. Battle =The first night= The battle opened on the night of 22 April 1951. A PVA patrol on the north bank of the river moved around the Belgians on Hill 194 and continued to advance east towards the two bridges on which the Belgians depended. Elements of the 29th Brigade's reserve, the 1st RUR, were deployed forward at about 22:00 to secure the crossing but were soon engaged by PVA forces trying to cross the river. The Royal Ulster Rifles were unable to secure the bridges. This development meant that the Belgian battalion on the north bank of the river was in danger of being isolated from the rest of the 29th Brigade. PVA forces following the initial patrol either attacked the Belgian positions on Hill 194 or continued their advance towards the bridges. Those who were able to cross the Imjin attacked the Fusiliers' right rear company, Z Company, on Hill 257, a position close to the river and almost directly south of the crossings. Further downstream, PVA forces managed to ford the Imjin and attacked the Fusiliers' left forward company, X Company, on Hill 152. The retreat of X Company from Hill 152 had serious consequences for Y Company, which occupied the right forward position of what can be described as a squarish fusilier position marked out by four widely spaced company perimeters at the corners. Although Y Company was not attacked directly, PVA forces threatened its flanks by forcing Z and X Companies from their positions. After unsuccessful British attempts to regain those lost positions on Hill 257 and 194, Y Company's position was abandoned, the retreat being covered by C Squadron, 8th Hussars. On the left of the brigade's line, a patrol of 17 men from the Glosters' C Company lying in wait on the river bank repulsed three attempts by a battalion of the 559th Regiment, 187th Division to cross the river, eventually retiring without loss when their ammunition ran low and assaulting troops finally gained the opposite bank. During the night the Glosters' A and D Companies were attacked, and by 07:30 A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from its position on Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, during which Lieutenant Philip Curtis single-handedly destroyed a PVA machine-gun position with a grenade but was himself killed by a burst of machine-gun fire in the process. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. =The Glosters' withdrawal to Hill 235= On 23 April, attempts by the Fusiliers and forces from the US 3rd Infantry Division's reserve to regain control of areas lost during the night failed. An attack by the US 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry, on enemy forces near Hill 257 was ordered to support the Belgian withdrawal from the north bank of the Imjin River. Despite losing seven vehicles, the Belgian Battalion successfully withdrew to the east and took up new positions south of the Glosters and the Fusiliers before moving to the vicinity of the 29th Brigade's command post. Gloster Hill five weeks after the battle M24 Chaffee light tanks in Korea. At around 20:30 on 23 April, the Glosters' A Company, now at less than half strength and with all officers killed or wounded, fell back to Hill 235. The withdrawal left D Company's position exposed, and with one of its platoons badly mauled in the overnight fighting, it too withdrew to the hill. Company B had not been pressed during the night, but the withdrawal of D Company on their left and the Fusiliers on their right left them exposed, and they were withdrawn to Hill 316, east of C Company. During the night of 23/24 April, the Glosters' B Company, outnumbered 18:1, endured six assaults, calling in artillery on their own position to break up the last of them. Low on ammunition and having taken many casualties, the seventh assault at 08:10 forced them to abandon their position, and just 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which battalion HQ, the Support Company and C Company had already withdrawn. As B Company fought for its life, the PVA 188th Division crossed the Imjin and attacked the Fusiliers and the Royal Ulster Rifles on the right of the brigade's line. The 187th Division also engaged the brigade's battalions on the right, while the 189th Division kept up the pressure on the left. Most dangerous for the integrity of the 29th Brigade was the deep penetration of the line between the Glosters and the Fusiliers which had cut off the former. To counter the PVA attack and protect the Glosters from being completely surrounded, the Philippine 10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT) was temporarily attached to the 29th Brigade. A combined force of M24 tanks of the 10th BCT and Centurions of the 8th Hussars supported by infantry reached a point from Hill 235 on 24 April. However, the column failed to make contact as the lead tank was hit by PVA fire and knocked out, blocking the route and making any further advance against heavy resistance impossible. At this point, according to an official American narrative of operations, \\"the brigade commander considered it unwise to continue the effort to relieve the Gloucester Battalion and withdrew the relief force\\". =Retreat of the 29th Brigade= Map showing the situation at 09:00, 25 April: The Glosters are isolated on Hill 235 near Solma-ri, west of Route 5Y. The brigade's main line of retreat is Route 11. The Belgian battalion occupies blocking positions near the brigade's command post, while RNF, RUR and 8th Hussars are still further north. Additional support is provided by elements of the U.S. 65th Infantry. Note also the escape route of the Glosters' D Company. Continued PVA pressure on the UN forces along the Imjin prevented a planned attack by the US 1st and 3rd Battalions, 65th Infantry, to relieve the Glosters. When two further attempts by a tank troop to link up with the Glosters failed, Brigadier Brodie left the decision to Lieutenant-Colonel Carne whether to attempt a break-out or surrender. No further attempts to relieve the Glosters were undertaken because, at 08:00 on 25 April, US I Corps issued the order to execute Plan Golden A, which called for a withdrawal of all forces to a new defensive position further south. In accordance with orders issued by I Corps, the Fusiliers, Rifles and Belgians, supported by the tanks of the 8th Hussars and the Royal Engineers of 55 Squadron, withdrew to the safety of the next UN position. The Belgians occupied blocking positions west and southwest of the 29th Brigade's command post in order to allow the other units of the brigade to fall back through the battalion's positions. The withdrawal under intense enemy pressure was made even more difficult by the fact that PVA forces dominated parts of the high ground along the line of retreat; they were able not only to observe any movements by the 29th Brigade, but also to inflict heavy casualties on the retreating units. Among those killed was the commanding officer of the Fusiliers, Lieutenant-Colonel Foster, who died when his jeep was hit by PVA mortar fire. In the words of Major Henry Huth of the 8th Hussars, the retreat was \\"one long bloody ambush\\". When B Company of the Ulsters, which had acted as rearguard during the retreat, reached the safety of the next UN line, all elements of the 29th Brigade except for the Glosters had completed the withdrawal. =The Glosters on Hill 235= The Glosters' situation on Hill 235 made it impossible for them to join the rest of the 29th Brigade after it had received the order to retreat. Even before the failed attempts to relieve the battalion on 24 April, B and C Companies had already suffered such heavy casualties that they were merged to form one company. Attempts to supply the battalion by air drop were unsuccessful.. Despite their difficult situation, the Glosters held their positions on Hill 235 throughout 24 April and the night of 24/25 April. In the morning of 25 April, 45 Field Regiment could no longer provide artillery support. Since Brigadier Brodie had left the final decision to Lieutenant-Colonel Carne, the Glosters' CO \\"gave the order to his company commanders to make for the British lines as best as they could\\" on the morning of 25 April. Only the remains of D Company under the command of Major Mike Harvey escaped successfully from Gloster Hill and reached the safety of UN lines after several days. The rest of the battalion was taken prisoner, including Lieutenant-Colonel Carne. Aftermath =Importance of the battle= Had the PVA achieved a breakthrough in the initial stages of their assault, they would have been able to outflank the ROK 1st Division to the west and the US 3rd Infantry Division to the east of the 29th Brigade. Such a development would have threatened the stability of the UN line and increased the likelihood of success for a PVA advance on Seoul. Although the PVA benefited from the brigade's scattered deployment and lack of defensive preparations, they were nevertheless unable to take the positions before UN forces could check further advances. In three days of fighting, the determined resistance of the 29th Brigade severely disrupted the PVA offensive, causing it to lose momentum, and allowed UN forces in the area to withdraw to the No- Name Line, a defensive position north of Seoul, where the PVA/KPA were halted. =Casualties and memorial= According to a memorandum presented to the British cabinet on 26 June 1951, 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties, including 34 officers and 808 other ranks missing.Memorandum to the British Cabinet, Catalogue reference CAB 21/1985 (26 June 1950). Retrieved 15 April 2008. These casualties represented 20 to 25 per cent of the brigade's strength on the eve of battle. Of the 1,091 soldiers killed, wounded or missing, 620 were from the Gloucestershire Regiment, which could muster 217 men on 27 April.1953 ‚Äì The Trials and Release of the P.O.Ws. Retrieved 2 May 2008. 522 soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment became prisoners of war. Of those taken prisoner, 180 were wounded and a further 34 died while in captivity. 59 soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment were killed in action. Based on estimates, PVA casualties in the Battle of the Imjin River can be put at around 10,000. As a result of the casualties suffered during the battle, the PVA 63rd Army, which had begun the offensive with three divisions and approximately 27,000 men, had lost over a third of its strength and was pulled out of the front line. The Gloucester Valley Battle Monument was later built at Gloster Hill , beside the Seolmacheon stream. The British Embassy in Seoul organises a service, officially called the Gloster Valley Memorial Service, for veterans on every anniversary of the battle. In 2008, it took place on 19 April as part of formal commemoration ceremonies that were held during 14‚Äì20 April.. The outline of the commemorations in 2008 encompassed a service of commemoration, including the laying of wreaths and the presentations of Gloster Valley Scholarships ‚Äì financial assistance to deserving children in the area where the battle took place ‚Äì as well as a picnic lunch that offered visitors the opportunity to mingle with veterans. About 70 British veterans and the British ambassador to South Korea took part in the event.

The Belgian United Nations Command, which was attached to the British 29th Brigade and replaced the 900 men of the Royal Ulster Rifles on 20 April 1951, initially held the brigade's right flank on the north bank of the river. It also included a Luxembourg platoon. It fought the Chinese there and then conducted a fighting withdrawal, supported by U.S. forces, before taking position in the center of the brigade's line, ahead of brigade headquarters, for the attempts to relieve the Glosters.

Along with the Ext functor, Tor is one of the central concepts of homological algebra, in which ideas from algebraic topology are used to construct invariants of algebraic structures. The homology of groups, Lie algebras, and associative algebras can all be defined in terms of Tor. The name comes from a relation between the first Tor group Tor1 and the torsion subgroup of an abelian group. In the special case of abelian groups, Tor was introduced by Eduard ƒåech (1935) and named by Samuel Eilenberg around 1950.Weibel (1999). It was first applied to the K√ºnneth theorem and universal coefficient theorem in topology. For modules over any ring, Tor was defined by Henri Cartan and Eilenberg in their 1956 book Homological Algebra.Cartan & Eilenberg (1956), section VI.1. Definition Let R be a ring. Write R-Mod for the category of left R-modules and Mod-R for the category of right R-modules. (If R is commutative, the two categories can be identified.) For a fixed left R-module B, let T(A) = A ‚äóR B for A in Mod-R. This is a right exact functor from Mod-R to the category of abelian groups Ab, and so it has left derived functors LiT. The Tor groups are the abelian groups defined by : \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(A,B) = (L_iT)(A), for an integer i. By definition, this means: take any projective resolution : \\\\cdots\\\\to P_2 \\\\to P_1 \\\\to P_0 \\\\to A\\\\to 0, remove the term A, and form the chain complex: : \\\\cdots \\\\to P_2\\\\otimes_R B \\\\to P_1\\\\otimes_R B \\\\to P_0\\\\otimes_R B \\\\to 0 For each integer i, Tor(A, B) is the homology of this complex at position i. It is zero for i negative. For example, Tor(A, B) is the cokernel of the map P1 ‚äóR B ‚Üí P0 ‚äóR B, which is isomorphic to A ‚äóR B. Alternatively, one can define Tor by fixing A and taking the left derived functors of the right exact functor G(B) = A ‚äóR B. That is, tensor A with a projective resolution of B and take homology. Cartan and Eilenberg showed that these constructions are independent of the choice of projective resolution, and that both constructions yield the same Tor groups.Weibel (1994), section 2.4 and Theorem 2.7.2. Moreover, for a fixed ring R, Tor is a functor in each variable (from R-modules to abelian groups). For a commutative ring R and R-modules A and B, Tor(A, B) is an R-module (using that A ‚äóR B is an R-module in this case). For a non- commutative ring R, Tor(A, B) is only an abelian group, in general. If R is an algebra over a ring S (which means in particular that S is commutative), then Tor(A, B) is at least an S-module. Properties Here are some of the basic properties and computations of Tor groups.Weibel (1994), Chapters 2 and 3. *Tor(A, B) ‚âÖ A ‚äóR B for any right R-module A and left R-module B. *Tor(A, B) = 0 for all i > 0 if either A or B is flat (for example, free) as an R-module. In fact, one can compute Tor using a flat resolution of either A or B; this is more general than a projective (or free) resolution.Weibel (1994), Lemma 3.2.8. *There are converses to the previous statement: **If Tor(A, B) = 0 for all B, then A is flat (and hence Tor(A, B) = 0 for all i > 0). **If Tor(A, B) = 0 for all A, then B is flat (and hence Tor(A, B) = 0 for all i > 0). *By the general properties of derived functors, every short exact sequence 0 ‚Üí K ‚Üí L ‚Üí M ‚Üí 0 of right R-modules induces a long exact sequence of the formWeibel (1994), Definition 2.1.1. ::\\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_2^R(M,B) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(K,B) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(L,B) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R (M,B) \\\\to K\\\\otimes_R B\\\\to L\\\\otimes_R B\\\\to M\\\\otimes_R B\\\\to 0, :for any left R-module B. The analogous exact sequence also holds for Tor with respect to the second variable. *Symmetry: for a commutative ring R, there is a natural isomorphism Tor(A, B) ‚âÖ Tor(B, A).Weibel (1994), Remark in section 3.1. (For R commutative, there is no need to distinguish between left and right R-modules.) *If R is a commutative ring and u in R is not a zero divisor, then for any R-module B, ::\\\\operatorname{Tor}^R_i(R/(u),B)\\\\cong\\\\begin{cases} B/uB & i=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ B[u] & i=1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} :where ::B[u] = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in B : ux =0 \\\\\\\\} :is the u-torsion subgroup of B. This is the explanation for the name Tor. Taking R to be the ring \\\\Z of integers, this calculation can be used to compute \\\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\\\Z}_1(A,B) for any finitely generated abelian group A. *Generalizing the previous example, one can compute Tor groups that involve the quotient of a commutative ring by any regular sequence, using the Koszul complex.Weibel (1994), section 4.5. For example, if R is the polynomial ring k[x1, ..., xn] over a field k, then \\\\operatorname{Tor}_*^R(k,k) is the exterior algebra over k on n generators in Tor1. * \\\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\\\Z}_i(A,B)=0 for all i ‚â• 2. The reason: every abelian group A has a free resolution of length 1, since every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian. *For any ring R, Tor preserves direct sums (possibly infinite) and filtered colimits in each variable.Weibel (1994), Corollary 2.6.17. For example, in the first variable, this says that ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R \\\\left (\\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha} M_{\\\\alpha}, N \\\\right ) &\\\\cong \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\alpha} \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(M_{\\\\alpha},N) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R \\\\left (\\\\varinjlim_{\\\\alpha} M_{\\\\alpha}, N \\\\right ) &\\\\cong \\\\varinjlim_{\\\\alpha} \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(M_{\\\\alpha},N) \\\\end{align} *Flat base change: for a commutative flat R-algebra T, R-modules A and B, and an integer i,Weibel (1994), Corollary 3.2.10. ::\\\\mathrm{Tor}_i^R(A,B)\\\\otimes_R T \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{Tor}_i^T(A\\\\otimes_R T,B\\\\otimes_R T). :It follows that Tor commutes with localization. That is, for a multiplicatively closed set S in R, ::S^{-1} \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(A, B) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^{S^{-1} R} \\\\left (S^{-1} A, S^{-1} B \\\\right ). *For a commutative ring R and commutative R-algebras A and B, Tor(A,B) has the structure of a graded-commutative algebra over R. Moreover, elements of odd degree in the Tor algebra have square zero, and there are divided power operations on the elements of positive even degree.Avramov & Halperin (1986), section 2.16; . Important special cases *Group homology is defined by H_*(G,M)=\\\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\\\Z[G]}_*(\\\\Z, M), where G is a group, M is a representation of G over the integers, and \\\\Z[G] is the group ring of G. *For an algebra A over a field k and an A-bimodule M, Hochschild homology is defined by ::HH_*(A,M)=\\\\operatorname{Tor}_*^{A\\\\otimes_k A^{\\\\text{op}}}(A, M). *Lie algebra homology is defined by H_*(\\\\mathfrak g,M)=\\\\operatorname{Tor}_*^{U\\\\mathfrak g}(R,M), where \\\\mathfrak g is a Lie algebra over a commutative ring R, M is a \\\\mathfrak g-module, and U\\\\mathfrak g is the universal enveloping algebra. *For a commutative ring R with a homomorphism onto a field k, \\\\operatorname{Tor}_*^R(k,k) is a graded- commutative Hopf algebra over k.Avramov & Halperin (1986), section 4.7.

Its role in politics spans over 100 years and four generations. Udall politicians have been elected from four different states: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oregon. If viewed as a combined entity, the Udall-Hunt-Lee family has been elected from six states: Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Utah. Three Udall family cousins were nominated by the two major American political parties for the United States Senate elections of 2008, of which the two Democrats were elected and seated in 2009. Pioneer generation David King Udall can be considered the family's founder. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to David Udall and Eliza King, recent Mormon converts from England. They immigrated to the United States in 1851. The family travelled across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains by ox cart and settled in Nephi, Utah. The elder David later became a Mormon bishop. In this environment, the younger David grew up to be a fervent Mormon as well. He married Eliza Stewart and they settled in Kanab, Utah. Shortly after their marriage, David left to serve as a missionary in England for two years. In 1880, he was called by his church to move with his family to St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona, in order to become the local bishop and facilitate further Mormon migration into that community.THE WEST ‚Äì David King Udall. PBS. Retrieved on 2010-11-30. This made David unpopular with established residents of St. Johns, who didn't want the Mormons there, but it did make him instantly prominent in the community. David took a second wife, Ida Hunt, in 1882. She was a granddaughter of Jefferson Hunt. David was prosecuted for, but not convicted of, bigamy in 1884. In 1885, he was indicted for perjury stemming from a sworn statement he made backing a land claim for Miles Romney (grandfather of George W. Romney). His bail was posted by Baron Goldwater (father of Barry Goldwater). The trial and its aftermath received heavy regional press coverage. David was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment at a federal penitentiary in Detroit, Michigan. Later, both the prosecutor and presiding judge at the trial wrote letters to President Grover Cleveland supporting a pardon, stating they believed that David had misunderstood the law and that he lacked any criminal intent. President Cleveland issued a pardon after David served just three months of his sentence. In 1887 David was made a stake president, a higher position in the Mormon hierarchy. In that position, he oversaw Mormon affairs over a broad portion of Arizona. That same year, Tommy Stewart, David's double brother-in-law, was elected to serve in the Utah Territorial Legislature. David's wife, Eliza, was Tommy's sister, and Tommy was married to David's sister, Mary, making Tommy a member of the Udall family by marriage. Tommy would later become mayor of Kanab. In 1890, the LDS Church officially declared it opposed its members from entering into polygamous marriage.Official Declaration‚Äî1 After this, hostility toward Mormons in many communities outside of Utah decreased. Between improved relations with non-Mormons, and an ever- growing Mormon population in eastern Arizona, David's popularity improved such that he was elected to a single term in the Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1899, as a Republican. He died as a widely respected member of his community in 1938, living long enough to see several of his sons elected to public office. David's younger brother, Joseph Udall, also settled in Arizona, becoming a Mormon Bishop in Eagar, Arizona, and was active in local politics. He served as chairman of the Apache County Board of Supervisors, 1906‚Äì1920.  Sons of David King Udall  Twelve of David King Udall's children lived to adulthood: six by each of his wives. Four of his sons became attorneys; of those, all were elected or appointed to political and judicial offices. All of the Udall politicians descended from David's wife Eliza have been Democrats, while most of the politicians descended from his wife Ida have been Republicans. The first of David's children to seek office was Levi Stewart Udall, who ran for clerk to the Arizona Superior Court in 1922 as a Democrat. His older brother, John Hunt Udall, then filed to run for the same office as a Republican. John won. John was later elected mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, and he served in that office 1936‚Äì1938. He later served as a judge, and was narrowly defeated as a candidate for U.S. Congress in 1948. He was first married to Ruth Kimball, sister of Spencer W. Kimball and niece by marriage of Joseph F. Smith. Ruth died at a young age, and he remarried to Leah Smith, daughter of Jesse Nathaniel Smith. Levi followed a career in the judiciary, and was elected Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court in 1946. He served on that Court from 1947 until his death in 1960, and he was Chief Justice 1951‚Äì53 and 1957‚Äì59. Levi was married to Louisa Lee. His brother, Jesse, was married to Louisa's sister Lela Lee. For this reason, their respective descendants are double cousins. The Lee sisters were granddaughters of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin. Jesse Addison Udall served in the Arizona House of Representatives 1931‚Äì1938. Upon his brother Levi's death, he was appointed by the governor to fill the same seat on the Arizona Supreme Court. He served 1960‚Äì72, and he was Chief Justice in 1964 and 1969. Don Taylor Udall served as Representative to the Arizona State Legislature 1941‚Äì42. He resigned to serve in World War II, and would later become a judge.  Grandchildren of David King Udall  Nick Udall, son of John H. Udall, followed in his father's footsteps, and served as mayor of Phoenix, 1948‚Äì52. Unlike his father, he was a Democrat. He also served as a Superior Court Judge in Maricopa County, Arizona, 1952‚Äì56. Many kinships between the Udalls and other politicians and well-known people come through Nick. This is not so surprising when considering that Nick was a great-grandson of Utah Lieutenant Governor Heber C. Kimball, who had 43 wives, 63 children, 176 grandchildren and 564 great-grandchildren. Among Nick's cousins is U.S. Ambassador J. Reuben Clark. Stewart Lee Udall, son of Levi S. Udall, served as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Arizona (1955‚Äì1961) and also as Secretary of the Interior (1961‚Äì1969). Point Udall, U.S. Virgin Islands, the easternmost point in the United States, is named in his honor. Morris King \\"Mo\\" Udall, Stewart's brother, also served as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Arizona (1961‚Äì1991) and ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1976. Point Udall, Guam, the westernmost point in the United States, is named in his honor. David K. Udall, son of Jesse A. Udall, served as a city councilman in Mesa, Arizona, for eight years. L. Kenyon Udall, son of Jesse A. Udall, served as the mayor of Gilbert, Arizona, from January 17, 1956, to June 8, 1959. Joseph Leon Pace, son of Luella Udall Pace, was mayor of San Jose, California, during the 1960s.  Fourth generation  Thomas Stewart \\"Tom\\" Udall, Stewart Udall's son, was the first of David King Udall's great-grandchildren to hold political office. He was a practicing attorney and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in New Mexico in 1984 and 1988. In 1990 he was elected Attorney General of New Mexico, a position he held 1991‚Äì99. He was finally elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from New Mexico's 3rd District in 1998, and he served as Representative 1999‚Äì2009. During this period he served in Congress beside his cousins Mark Udall and Gordon Smith (see below), marking one of the very few times in history when three members of the same family have served in Congress simultaneously. In 2008 he was elected to the U.S. Senate from New Mexico in a landslide victory. He took office in January 2009. Gordon Harold Smith, Jesse Udall's grandson through his daughter Jessica Udall Smith, was the next to venture into politics. His father, Milan Dale Smith, Sr., was an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, and he later built a successful frozen foods empire. Gordon obtained a law degree and initially pursued a career as an attorney, before later taking over the frozen food business. In 1992, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate, as a Republican. He became president of that body in 1995. In 1997, he was narrowly defeated when running for the U.S. Senate in a special election to replace Bob Packwood. Later that year he won election to Oregon's other U.S. Senate seat, the only time anyone has ever run for the Senate twice in the same year. He served in the Senate 1998‚Äì2009. In 2008, he was narrowly defeated for reelection, following a shift in Oregon politics over the preceding decade toward the Democratic Party. He was the last remaining Republican to hold statewide office at the time. Most Udall politicians have also been either Hunt or Lee descendants. Gordon Smith is unique in being descended from both additional lines. Mark Emery Udall, Morris Udall's son, pursued a 20-year career as an Outward Bound instructor and director before launching a political career in 1996 with a successful campaign for the Colorado State House of Representatives as a Democrat. He served a single term there, before a successful bid for the U.S. House from Colorado's 2nd Congressional District in 1998. He held that office for ten years. In 2008 he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Colorado, and he was seated in January 2009. Raised Presbyterian, Mark is the first non-Mormon politician in the family. With Barack Obama's nomination of Ken Salazar as Secretary of the Interior, Colorado's other Senate seat was vacated January 20, 2009, and Mark became Colorado's senior Senator after just three weeks in office. In 2014, he was defeated for re-election by Republican Cory Gardner. Milan Dale Smith, Jr., Gordon Smith's brother, was nominated to the federal judiciary by George W. Bush in 2006. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate (including his brother), and he currently serves on the U.S. Ninth Circuit. David King Udall, son of Mesa councilman David K. Udall, serves as a Superior Court Judge in Maricopa County, Arizona (since 2001). His brother Jesse is married to Michelle Udall who was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2016. Mike Lee and Thomas R. Lee, though not Udalls, are second cousins to Mark and Tom Udall and Gordon Smith; their father, Rex E. Lee, a well-known scholar of Constitutional Law and Solicitor General from 1981 to 1985, was a first cousin of Stewart and Morris Udall; Mike Lee serves as a United States Senator from Utah (since 2011), and Thomas R. Lee is an Associate Justice of the Utah Supreme Court.

Eszterh√°s (; born November 23, 1944), also known as Joe Eszterhas, is a Hungarian-American writer. He wrote the screenplays for the films Flashdance, Jagged Edge, Basic Instinct and Showgirls. He has also written several books, including an autobiography entitled Hollywood Animal, American Rhapsody and Crossbearer: A Memoir of Faith. Early life J√≥zsef A. Eszterh√°s was born in Cs√°k√°nydoroszl√≥, a village in Hungary to Roman Catholic parents, M√°ria (n√©e B√≠r√≥) and Istv√°n Eszterh√°s. Eszterhas lived as a child in a refugee camp in Austria. The family eventually moved to New York City, and then to immigrant neighborhoods in Cleveland, where Eszterhas spent most of his childhood. Eszterhas learned, at age 45, that his father had concealed his World War II collaboration in the Hungarian government after the German occupation of Hungary and that he had \\"organized book burnings and had produced anti-Semitic propaganda.\\" After this discovery, he cut his father out of his life entirely, never reconciling before his father's death. Journalist Eszterhas went on to be a senior editor from 1971 to 1975 for Rolling Stone. He became a National Book Award nominee for his nonfiction work Charlie Simpson's Apocalypse in 1974. Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing (1974) involved Eszterhas and is one of only two false light cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a reporter for The Plain Dealer, Eszterhas covered the aftermath of the collapse of a bridge across the Ohio River. The article included a supposed interview of the widow of one of the fatal victims of the collapse. Months after the accident, he and a photographer visited the home of Margaret Cantrell. She was not home, but he talked to the children as the photographer took photos. His Sunday magazine feature focused on the family's poverty and contained several inaccuracies. Eszterhas had made it seem as though he spoke to her, describing her mood and attitude in the story. Cantrell filed suit for invasion of privacy, and won a $60,000 judgment in her favor. The decision was overturned in the Court of Appeals on First Amendment grounds, but in the end, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the original judgment in her favor. Screenwriting and fame Eszterhas' first produced screenplay was F.I.S.T., directed by Norman Jewison. Eszterhas contributed to the script of 1983's highly successful Flashdance, and wrote the screenplays for Jagged Edge, Jade, Betrayed, Sliver, and Basic Instinct. In 1989, Eszterhas planned to leave Creative Artists Agency because an old friend was restarting his agency. Michael Ovitz, then the chairman of CAA, threatened to prevent CAA actors from acting in Eszterhas' future projects. Eszterhas wrote a letter that loosened the stranglehold that CAA had on Hollywood. In 1995, Eszterhas wrote Showgirls, which won that year's Golden Raspberry Award for \\"Worst Screenplay\\". Despite the negative press, the film enjoyed cult success on the home video market, generating more than $100 million from video rentalshttps://web.archive.org/web/20200611131729/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture- news/showgirls-paul-verhoeven-on-the-greatest-stripper-movie-ever-made-54740/ and became one of MGM's top twenty all-time bestsellers. Following the success of Basic Instinct, Eszterhas produced two films in 1997, both of which he wrote: Telling Lies in America and An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn. Burn Hollywood Burn, about a director named Alan Smithee who films a big- budget bomb and then tries to destroy it, flopped at the box office. It did win several Golden Raspberry Awards, four of them awarded to Eszterhas himself: Worst Picture (Eszterhas was the film's uncredited producer), Worst Screenplay, and both Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actor for a brief on- screen cameo. The failure of Burn Hollywood Burn took a toll on Eszterhas' career: none of the screenplays he wrote between 1997 and 2006 were produced. However, Children of Glory, a Hungarian language film based upon his screenplay, was released in 2006. The film focuses upon both the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the Blood in the Water match at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Children of Glory was entered by invitation in the official section of 2007 Berlin Film Festival. In 2011, it was announced that actor-director Mel Gibson had commissioned a screenplay from Eszterhas: a historical biopic on Judah and The Maccabees, titled M.C.K.B.I. The film was to be distributed by Warner Bros. The announcement generated controversy. In a 2008 interview, Eszterhas had written that \\"Mel shared the mind-set of Adolf Hitler.\\" In a February 2012 interview with Andrew Goldman of The New York Times, Goldman said to Eszterhas: \\"[Gibson's] film The Passion of the Christ was widely considered anti-Semitic. Then, during a 2006 arrest for drunken driving, he ranted that 'the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Is he the right director?\\" Eszterhas' reply was: \\"... Adam Fogelson, Universal Pictures' chairman, said to [Gibson], 'Why do you want to do this story?' Mel said, 'Because I think I should.' I liked that answer very much.\\" When asked about their shared Catholic faith, Eszterhas said of Gibson, \\"In my mind, his Catholicism is a figment of his imagination.\\" By April 2012, Warner Bros. had cancelled the project; the film's last draft was dated February 20, 2012. Eszterhas claimed the break was caused by Gibson's violent outbursts and anti- Semitism, while Gibson blamed a bad script. Eszterhas later wrote a book, Heaven and Mel, about his experiences working with Gibson. Other works Eszterhas has written several best-selling books, including Hollywood Animal, an autobiography about politics in Hollywood, which superimposes his life as a young immigrant in the United States on his life as a powerful Hollywood player. A third book, The Devil's Guide to Hollywood, was published in September 2006. His book Crossbearer: A Memoir of Faith was published in 2008. It tells the story of his return to the Roman Catholic Church and his new- found devotion to God and family after surviving a throat cancer diagnosis in 2001. Eszterhas admitted smoking four packs of Salem Light cigarettes a day, as well as drinking heavily. He underwent surgery to remove 80% of his larynx, and had a trachea fitted. Eszterhas wrote a book about his experiences with Mel Gibson and anti-Semitism, titled Heaven and Mel, wherein he portrays Gibson as a man fueled only by hatred, prone to violent outbursts.Eszterhas, Joe (2012). Heaven and Mel, Amazon Kindle Single. ASIN B0087PTQ96 Among many damning statements is Eszterhas' claim that while staying at Gibson's Costa Rican estate to work on a script, he became so afraid that he slept with a golf club in his hand.Joe Eszterhas' interview on The Howard Stern Show, June 27, 2012 Personal life In 1974, Eszterhas married Gerri Javor. They had two children together and divorced in 1994. That same year, Eszterhas married Naomi Bakar, and they had four children. In 1990, Eszterhas learned that his father was then being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for writing anti-Semitic propaganda in Hungary during the 1930s and early 1940s. He refused further contact with his father after this revelation, which he later claimed to have regretted, saying \\"When [my father] was in a Hungarian old-age home, the nurses kept calling and saying, 'He's dying, and he needs to see you.' Not going was a huge mistake. I‚Äôve asked God to forgive me, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be forgiven.\\" Eszterhas is a Republican. Filmography * F.I.S.T.

They comprise the main islands of Great Abaco and Little Abaco, along with smaller barrier cays. The northernmost are Walker's Cay, and its sister island Grand Cay. To the south, the next inhabited islands are Spanish Cay and Green Turtle Cay, with its settlement of New Plymouth, Great Guana Cay, private Scotland Cay, Man-O-War Cay, and Elbow Cay, with its settlement of Hope Town. Southernmost are Tilloo Cay and Lubbers Quarters. Another of note off Abaco's western shore is onetime Gorda Cay, now a Disney Island and cruise ship stop and renamed Castaway Cay. Also in the vicinity is Moore's Island. On the Big Island of Abaco is Marsh Harbour, the Abacos' commercial hub and the Bahamas' third largest city, plus the resort area of Treasure Cay. Both have airports. A few mainland settlements of significance are Coopers Town and Fox Town in the north and Cherokee and Sandy Point in the south. Administratively, the Abaco Islands constitute seven of the 31 Local Government Districts of the Bahamas: Grand Cay, North Abaco, Green Turtle Cay, Central Abaco, South Abaco, Moore's Island, and Hope Town. Geography The Abaco Islands consist of limestone with some elevation and are protected on the ocean side by the third largest barrier reef in the world. The cays are mostly green with mangroves and white-sand beaches. Most of the islands are uninhabited. The Abaco Islands and their cays have been called Out Islands, Family Islands and Friendly Islands. History The Abaco Islands were first inhabited by the Lucayans. The first European settlers of the islands were Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution who arrived in 1783, as was also the case at Cat Island. These original Loyalist settlers made a modest living by salvaging wrecks, by building small wooden boats, and by basic farming. = Pre-Columbian and Spanish eras = The original inhabitants of the Bahamas before the arrival of Europeans were the Lucayans. They were a branch of the Ta√≠nos who inhabited most of the Caribbean islands at the time. The Lucayans were the first inhabitants of the Americas encountered by Christopher Columbus. The Spanish started seizing Lucayans as slaves within a few years of Columbus's arrival, and they had all been removed from the Bahamas by 1520. After the extermination of the Lucayans, there were no known permanent settlements in the Bahamas for approximately 130 years. Spain laid claim to the Bahamas after Columbus's discovery of the islands but showed little interest in them. The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci spent four months exploring the Bahamas in 1499‚Äì1500. Juan de la Cosa's first map of the New World, printed in 1500, shows the Abaco Islands with the name Habacoa. The map in Peter Martyr's first edition of 'De Orbe Novo' in 1511 shows the islands of the Bahamas but does not name them. The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n landed on Abaco in 1513. The Turin map of 1523 clearly shows Abaco, now named Iucayonique. This remained the most accurate map of the area until the first English maps of the Bahamas were produced. Both John White's map of 1590 and Thomas Hood's map of 1592 show the islands, as did a map produced in 1630 by the Dutchman de Laet. At this time the Spanish empire in the Caribbean was focused on Havana. Spain regarded the now-depopulated Bahamas as unprofitable and treacherous to navigate;- in 1593 a Spanish fleet of 17 ships was wrecked off Abaco. Also, English and French pirates and freebooters had begun preying on Spanish vessels north of Cuba. A Spanish ordinance of 1561 forbade any merchant ship to enter the Bahamas without an escort. Ownership of the Bahamas passed back and forth between Spain and Great Britain for 150 years, until British ownership was established by treaty in 1783, when Great Britain ceded East Florida to Spain, receiving the Bahamas in return. = British colonial era = In the summer of 1783, a call for those wishing to help settle Abaco was published in the Royal Gazette in New York City. About 1500 Loyalists left New York and moved to Abaco in August 1783. The Loyalists settled on a small sandy harbor about 6 leagues north of Marsh Harbour near modern-day Treasure Cay. They planned and built the town of Carleton, named after Sir Guy Carleton. Disputes over food distribution and having been misled about the resources available, led some of these settlers to found a rival town near Marsh Harbour called Maxwell. Conflict between disgruntled settlers and the officials responsible for helping became a constant feature of life on the islands. Sea island cotton was first sown by the settlers in 1785 and although both 1786 and 1787 produced good crops, the 1788 crop was blighted by caterpillars. Other settlements on the islands were Green Turtle Cay, Man-o-War Cay, and Sandy Point. In the 1790s, a group of Loyalists from the Carolinas arrived on the islands via Florida, founding the isolated settlement of Cherokee Sound. =Early 1970s= In June 1971, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Lynden Pindling, announced his government's plans for independence from Britain. On Abaco, the Greater Abaco Council was formed to lobby for continued British rule. In July 1971 the Greater Abaco Council submitted a petition to the Queen asking that Abaco become a 'completely self-contained and fully self- supporting' territory under British jurisdiction. In August 1971 the British Government refused to consider the petition. The September 1972 general election in the Bahamas showed a clear majority for independence across the country. However, on Abaco the results were less clear cut. The pro- independence Progressive Liberal Party won one of Abaco's two seats by a small majority, while the Free National Movement, who opposed early independence, won the other seat by a large majority. Starting in December 1971, all party talks took place in London to draft a new constitution for the Bahamas. The Greater Abaco Council sent representatives to London for a 'collateral conference' to run alongside the official talks. The British refused to consider making Abaco independent separately from the rest of the Bahamas. The GAC accepted this and the group ceased activity at the end of 1972. Shortly afterwards, Errington Watkins, the Free National Movement representative for the Abaco-Marsh Harbour seat, formed a successor group, the Council for a Free Abaco. A second petition was organised and signed by half the registered voters on the island. Errington Watkins took this petition to London in May 1973, hoping to influence the Bahamas Independence Order then being debated in the British Parliament. A sympathetic MP, Ronald Bell introduced an amendment that would have excluded Abaco from an independent Bahamas and have the islands remain a British colony. This amendment was defeated in the House of Commons and the Bahamas Independence Order was approved on 22 May 1973. Three weeks later a similar motion on Abaco was defeated in the House of Lords. A last-ditch attempt by Errington Watkins to pass a resolution in the Bahamas House of Assembly calling for a United Nations-supervised referendum on Abaco was easily defeated in June 1973 and the Bahamas became independent on 10 July 1973. =Abaco Independence Movement and onward= In August 1973, shortly after the Bahamas became independent, the Abaco Independence Movement was formed as a political party whose stated aim was self-determination for Abaco within a federal Bahamas. AIM was formed by Chuck Hall and Bert Williams. They sought support from the US Libertarian Party and an American financier named Michael Oliver, who through his libertarian Phoenix Foundation agreed to support AIM financially. Mitchell WerBell, an American arms dealer and mercenary, also supported AIM. His talk of an armed insurrection and attempts to recruit mercenaries to go to Abaco greatly discredited AIM. The Progressive Liberal Party victory in the 1977 general election, effectively marked the end of the movement. =Hurricane Dorian= On September 1, 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands at 16:40 UTC with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and wind gusts up to 225 mph (360 km/h), tying Dorian with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane on record. There are reports of major damage throughout the islands which has been described as \\"catastrophic damage\\" and \\"pure hell\\". Demographics Topographic map of the Abaco Islands The combined population of the islands was about 17,224 , and the principal settlement and capital is Marsh Harbour. In addition to Marsh Harbour there are several other settlements on Great Abaco including Cherokee Sound, Coopers Town, Crossing Rock, Green Turtle Cay, Hope Town, Little Harbour, Rocky Point, Sandy Point, Spring City, Treasure Cay, Wilson City, and Winding Bay. Surrounding Great Abaco are several smaller islands known as cays, many of which are popular with tourists visiting the islands. A few notable cays include Castaway Cay (formerly Gorda Cay), Elbow Cay, Tilloo Cay, the Grand Cays, Great Guana Cay, Man-O-War Cay, Green Turtle Cay, Moore's Island, and Walker's Cay.Diving in Abaco Bahamas, Retrieved 6 November 2013 Activities The Bahamas National Trust maintains six national parks in the Abacos Islands. These are: * Pelican Cays Land and Sea Park * Abaco National Park * Black Sound Cay National Reserve * Walker's Cay National Park * Tilloo Cay National Reserve * Fowl Cays National Park The Great Abaco Family Fitness weekend takes place every March in Treasure Cay, attracting both domestic and international tourism. The events include an open water swim, sprint and Olympic triathlons, a children's race, and a 5k/10k fun run/walk. The Abaco Club features a renowned 18 hole championship golf course designed by Donald Steel and Tom Mackenzie. The course is home to Great Abaco Classic on the Web.com Tour The red and white striped lighthouse at Hope Town in the Abaco Islands, is a noted local landmark. Transportation Marsh Harbour Airport (MHH) and Treasure Cay Airport (TCB) serve the needs of the Abacos, and all Abaco travel connects or originates in Florida or Atlanta. On the main island cars and boat rentals are available. On some of the cays, rental golf carts and boats are the main mode of transportation, along with bikes or scooters. Marsh Harbour Airport was the site of a plane crash on August 25, 2001, that claimed the lives of nine passengers, among them R&B; singer Aaliyah. The cays can be reached by ferries. The southern cays can be reached from Marsh Harbour and another ferry leaves from the Treasure Cay ferry dock about a half-hour from Marsh Harbour by road. Ferry service is also to be found between Nassau and Sandy Point on the southern end of Great Abaco on weekends. =Sandy Point= Sandy Point is a small settlement at the tip of southwest Abaco, Bahamas. It is the location of \\"Sandy Point Airport\\", which has yet to serve any regular scheduled carrier, and a new police station. Sandy Point also has a few shops, some churches and a few bonefish lodges. The annual \\"Homecoming and Conch Fest\\" is held around Bahamian Labour Day, the first Friday in June. In the 1990s, The Walt Disney Company bought Gorda Cay and renamed it Castaway Island and made it a stop on their \\"Island in the Sun\\" cruise ship offering. Many Disney employees live in Sandy Point. There is no public access for tourists from shore. Also off shore and a little more to the north, lies Moore's Island. It has two settlements \\"Hard Bargain\\" and \\"The Bight\\". Hole-in-the-Wall, which is the site of a light house, may seem nearby but should be a trip unto itself and only in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle when coming from Marsh Harbour. Economy The Abaco Islands have been long famous for shipbuilding. Their chief exports are lumber, fruit, and pearl shells. Crawfish (Caribbean spiny lobster) are exported to the United States. Pulpwood is shipped to a Florida plant for processing. Tourism is a major portion of the economy. Environment The Abaco Islands boast important natural areas, especially important coral reef areas, barrier-island terrestrial habitats and large forests of Bahamian pine (Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis), some of which still contain old-growth trees. As development expands in the Abacos, local groups have begun to fight for the preservation of their natural resources, such as in the development case on Great Guana Cay. Species of birds include the Bahamian subspecies of Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala bahamensis), which exists only in Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the southern Bahamas and Abaco. This population is unique in that it nests in limestone solution cavities rather than tree cavities. Abaco is also known for its intact elkhorn and staghorn coral structures, and for a breed of feral horse, the Abaco Barb, which became extinct in 2015.

It is the namesake of the Amor asteroids, the second-largest subgroup of near-Earth objects. It was discovered by Eug√®ne Delporte at the Uccle Observatory in 1932, the first time that an asteroid was seen to approach Earth so closely. The assumed S-type asteroid is one of few low-numbered asteroids for which no rotation period has been determined. It was assigned the provisional designation ' and named for Cupid, also known as \\"Amor\\" in Latin, the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Eros.  Discovery  On 12 March 1932, Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte photographed Amor at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, as it approached Earth to within 16 million kilometers (about 40 times the distance from Earth to the Moon). This was the first time that an asteroid was seen to approach Earth so closely. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation on 12 March 1932, when it was observed at the Uccle and Heidelberg observatories simultaneously.  Orbit and classification  Amor is the namesake of the Amor asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. Next to the Apollo group, the Amors are the second largest group of near-Earth objects with more than 7,000 known members. As with many members of this group, Amor is also a Mars-crosser, crossing the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.08‚Äì2.76 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (971 days; semi-major axis of 1.92 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.44 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. = Close encounters = Amor has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which corresponds to 41.6 lunar distances. In March 1940, it approached Earth to , its closest approach of all close encounters since 1900. Only in March 2129, it will approach Earth at a similar distance of .  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Roman god of love, Cupid, also known as Amor in Latin, and the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Eros. The near-Earth asteroids 433 Eros and 763 Cupido are also named after the god of love. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  Amor is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Amor has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to Tom Gehrels publication Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids from 1994 (pp. 540‚Äì543), Amor measures 1.0 kilometer in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.15. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 0.857 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.7.

The known numbered Earth-crossers are listed here. Those Earth-crossers whose semi-major axes are smaller than Earth's are Aten asteroids; the remaining ones are Apollo asteroids. (See also the Amor asteroids.) An asteroid with an Earth-crossing orbit is not necessarily in danger of colliding with Earth. The orbit of an Earth-crossing asteroid may not even intersect with that of Earth. This apparent contradiction arises because many asteroids have highly inclined orbits, so although they may have a perihelion less than that of Earth, their paths can never cross. An asteroid for which there is some possibility of a collision with Earth at a future date and which is above a certain size is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA). Specifically, an asteroid is a PHA if its Earth minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is <0.05 AU and its absolute magnitude is 22 or brighter.\\"Near Earth Object Program\\", National Aeronautics and Space Administration, retrieved online 3 May 2009. The concept of PHA is intended to replace the now abandoned strict definition of ECA (Earth-crossing asteroid) which existed for a few years. Determining if an asteroid was an ECA required calculation of its orbits millennia into the future, including planetary gravitational perturbations, to assess whether a collision with Earth was possible and this has proved to be impractical.Brian G. Marsden, \\"Press Information Sheet:Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\\", Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, retrieved online 3 May 2009. Having a small MOID is not a guarantee of a collision. On the other hand, small gravitational perturbations of the asteroid around its orbit from planets that it passes can significantly alter its path. For instance, 99942 Apophis will approach Earth so closely in 2029 that it will get under the orbit of the Earth's geostationary satellites.Dr. Tony Phillips, \\"Friday the 13th, 2029\\", Science@NASA, retrieved online May 3, 2009.

USS Mount Whitney also serves as the Afloat Command Platform (ACP) of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO). The ship had previously served for years as the COMSTRIKFLTLANT(NATO Designation) / US Second Fleet's command ship. She is one of only a few commissioned ships to be assigned to Military Sealift Command. Mount Whitney was classified as LCC-20 on 1 January 1969, and her keel was laid down on 8 January by Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia. At the time of her commissioning, Mount Whitney joined her sister ship Blue Ridge as having the distinction of carrying the world's most sophisticated electronics suites. It was said to be some thirty percent larger than that of the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, which had been the most complex. Mount Whitney was armed with a \\"main battery\\" of computers, communications gear, and other electronic facilities to fulfill her mission as a command ship. An extremely refined communications system was also an integral part of the ship's radical new design. Through an automated patch panel and computer-controlled switching matrix, her crew could use any combination of communication equipment desired. The clean topside area is the result of careful design intended to minimize the ship's interference with her own communications system. US Navy long-range communications were heavily reliant on high-frequency radio systems in the 1970s and have evolved to predominantly satellite communications in the 2000s. This is illustrated by the long wire antennas and the directional HF yagi or log-periodic antenna initially installed on Mount Whitney and later removed and replaced with a number of satellite communications antennas.  Etymology  The ship is named for Mount Whitney, a peak in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Mount Whitney is the highest summit in the contiguous United States, with an elevation of .  Capability  Mount Whitney is the most sophisticated Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) ship ever commissioned, She incorporates various elements of the most advanced C4I equipment and gives the embarked Joint Task Force Commander the capability to effectively command all units under their command. Mount Whitney can transmit and receive large amounts of secure data to and from any point on earth through HF, UHF, VHF, and SHF (satellite) communications channels. This electronic technology enables the Joint Intelligence Center and Joint Operations Center to provide the most timely intelligence and operational support available in the Navy.  Ship history  =1970s and 1980s= From 1971 to 2005, Mount Whitney served as the flagship for Commander Second Fleet/Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic. =1990s= In 1994, during the FleetEx 2/94 \\"George Washington\\" war game exercise, the Argentine Navy, acting as the enemy and using the diesel submarine , went undetected, penetrated the destroyer defense and \\"sank\\" Mount Whitney, which was acting as the command ship during the exercise. Mount Whitney deployed in 1994 to Haiti with Lieutenant General Hugh Shelton, the commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps, in command of the Joint Task Force that conducted Operation Uphold Democracy. =2000s= USS Mount Whitney in the year 2005. On 12 November 2002, Mount Whitney deployed to the Central Command area of responsibility in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. She was acting as the initial command post for Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa. During the deployment, the ship embarked elements of the 2nd Marine Division and II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF), based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, under the command of Major General John F. Sattler and Captain Morton W. Kenyon. In 2004, Military Sealift Command civilian sailors were integrated into her crew. She remains a commissioned warship in the United States Navy, but the size of her crew was reduced from about 600 sailors to about 170 Navy officers and enlisted personnel and 155 civilians. In February 2005, Mount Whitney left Norfolk for Gaeta, Italy where she was redesignated (LCC/JCC 20) and assumed duties as the 6th Fleet flagship, officially relieving . She also assumed duties as the command ship for the Commander, Joint Command Lisbon and the Commander, Striking Force NATO. In August 2008, Mount Whitney was deployed to the Black Sea in support of Operation Assured Delivery to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the Russo-Georgian War and became the first NATO ship to deliver aid to port of Poti, Georgia. On 6 November 2008, Mount Whitney was unable to enter the port at Sevastopol. City authorities and representatives of the Ukrainian Navy refused to comment on the event. Individuals working for the city administration reported that the failure was due to issues with Mount Whitneys border crossing documents, while others suggested anti-NATO protests were the cause. =2010s= Officers from coalition countries meet aboard Mount Whitney while off the coast of Libya during Operation Odyssey Dawn From 19 March 2011, Mount Whitney served in the Mediterranean as the main command vessel for the enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 against Libya. She was the flagship for Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, who had tactical command of the Operation Odyssey Dawn joint task force. The vessel was serving as a command-and-control vessel for the United States' involvement in the coalition campaign aimed to enforce a Libya no-fly zone and prevent Muammar Gaddafi's forces from attacking the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Georgian Coast Guard ship Sokhumi near Batumi, Georgia, in November 2013 In February 2013, Mount Whitney transferred to the San Giorgio del Porto Shipyard in Genoa, Italy for a major 60-day overhaul and repair project. The ship returned to active duty in April 2013 at the end of the maintenance window. On 31 January 2014, Mount Whitney left her homeport of Gaeta, Italy. Mount Whitney, along with , were the first two US Navy ships to operate in the Black Sea during the Sochi Olympics. On 31 July 2015, a fire broke out aboard Mount Whitney while she was in Viktor Lenac Shipyard, Rijeka, Croatia. There were no reported injuries, and the fire was extinguished within 45 minutes by ship's crew and shipyard fire brigade personnel. Mount Whitney had been in Viktor Lenac Shipyard since January 2015 undergoing a scheduled maintenance overhaul designed to extend the service life of the ship to 2039. On 30 June 2016, Mount Whitney visited Klaipƒóda, Lithuania, and in October 2016, she visited Souda Bay, Greece. From early 2017 through to October 2017, Mount Whitney was at the Viktor Lenac Shipyard; Rijeka, Croatia, for further upgrades to its information technology infrastructure, and various engineering refurbishments. In September 2018, Mount Whitney visited Thessaloniki, Greece, for the 83rd Thessaloniki International Fair, where the US was the country of honor. From 25 October to 7 November 2018, she served as the command vessel for the NATO exercise Trident Juncture.

Life and career Karl Bitter in 1905 Manhattan studio that Bitter shared with Giuseppe Moretti The son of Carl and Henrietta Bitter, he was born in the municipal district Rudolfsheim- F√ºnfhaus of Vienna. His early training took place at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule (the imperial school for the applied arts), and after that at the Kunstakademie (the Academy of Fine Arts). At the Academy, he studied with August K√ºhne and Edmund Heller. Upon his graduation, he was apprenticed to an architectural sculptor,. This was the period that the Ringstra√üe was being built in Vienna, and a large number of decorated buildings were being built. He was drafted into the Austrian Army, and deserted while on leave. He was unable to return to Austria for many years because of his desertion. He later was pardoned by Emperor Franz Josef of Austria, who hoped to lure the famous sculptor back to Vienna.\\"Karl Bitter's Statuary on St. Paul Building May Be Offered Austria, Which Exiled Him\\", The New York Times. December 2, 1957. p. 24. Retrieved March 15, 2011. Bitter immigrated to the United States in 1889, arriving in New York City. He applied for citizenship, and set to work as an assistant with a firm of house decorators. While employed with this firm, at age 21, he competed for the Astor memorial bronze gates of Trinity Church and won. The work gave him sufficient capital to build and establish a small studio on 13th Street. Bitter modeled seated statues of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton to flank the entrance to the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio (1909‚Äì11). He portrayed the men in early middle age, as in the 1780s when they clashed over what kind of nation the United States should become. Missouri commissioned a copy of Jefferson (1913), and Bitter made minor alterations to portray Jefferson as he looked as president when he signed the Louisiana Purchase Treaty in 1803. For the commission from the University of Virginia, Bitter aged Jefferson further, portraying him as he looked in retirement.Schevill, pp. 52‚Äì53. About this time, Bitter was discovered by Richard Morris Hunt, the architect of choice of many of New York's rich and famous. From that time on Bitter was never without work. After working as a sculptor at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and as director at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901, Bitter's extraordinary organizational skills led him to be named head of the sculpture programs at both the 1904 St. Louis Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, where Lee Lawrie trained with his guidance, and the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition held in San Francisco, California. In 1906/1907, he presided over the National Sculpture Society. Among the awards won by Bitter were the silver medal of the Paris Exposition, 1900; the gold medal of the Pan-American Exposition, 1901; a gold medal at Philadelphia, 1902; and the gold medal at the St. Louis Exposition, 1904. He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, vice-president (1906‚Äì08 and 1914‚Äì15); the National Academy of Design, to which he was elected in 1902; the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Players' Club, Century Club, and vice- president of the Architectural League from 1904 to 1906 and from 1909 to 1911, and member of the Art Commission, New York, from 1912 to 1915. Although Bitter arose out of the Classical/Naturalist styles he was increasingly turning towards a more modern approach to sculpture. Much of the work in Buffalo and St. Louis was allegorical in nature. Where this would have taken him will never be known, because he was killed in an accident in 1915 when, while leaving the Metropolitan Opera in New York, a car jumped the curb on Broadway and struck him down. His wife survived the accident as he had pushed her out of the way of the oncoming car. Like many of the sculptors and painters of the day, Bitter frequently employed the services of the muse and history's first \\"super model\\", Audrey Munson. On June 30, 1901, he married Marie A. Schevill, of Cincinnati, Ohio. They had three children: Francis T. R. Bitter, Marietta C. E. Bitter and John F. Bitter. Their son Francis Bitter, born in 1902, became a prominent American physicist. For a time, Bitter's studio was located in a building known as The Castle in Weehawken, New Jersey. The Castle was created as a part of the Eldorado Amusement Park.

Class 0 These appliances have no protective-earth connection and feature only a single level of insulation between live parts and exposed metalwork. If permitted at all, Class 0 items are intended for use in dry areas only. A single fault could cause an electric shock or other dangerous occurrence, without triggering the automatic operation of any fuse or circuit breaker. Sales of such items have been prohibited in much of the world for safety reasons, for example in the UK by Section 8 of The Low Voltage Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1989 and New Zealand by the Electricity Act. A typical example of a Class 0 appliance is the old style of Christmas fairy lights. However, equipment of this class is common in some 110 V countries, and in much of the 220 V developing world, whether permitted officially or not. These appliances do not have their chassis connected to electrical earth. In many countries the plug of a class 0 equipment is such that it cannot be inserted to grounded outlet like Schuko. The failure of such an equipment in a location where there are grounded equipment can cause fatal shock if one touches both. Any equipment with a schuko plug will act like a Class 0 equipment when connected to an ungrounded outlet. Class I green/yellow ground Class I symbol These appliances must have their chassis connected to electrical earth (US: ground) by a separate earth conductor (coloured green/yellow in most countries, green in India, USA, Canada and Japan). The earth connection is achieved with a 3-conductor mains cable, typically ending with 3-prong AC connector which plugs into a corresponding AC outlet. The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that if a fault occurs the supply will be removed automatically (this is sometimes referred to as ADS = Automatic Disconnection of Supply). A fault in the appliance which causes a live conductor to contact the casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor. If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker (CB)) and disconnect the supply. The disconnection time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start if a person is in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high- impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite. Class 0I Electrical installations where the chassis is connected to earth with a separate terminal, instead of via the mains cable. In effect this provides the same automatic disconnection as Class I, for equipment that otherwise would be Class 0. Class II Class II symbol A Class II or double insulated electrical appliance is one which has been designed in such a way that it does not require a safety connection to electrical earth (ground). The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that this is achieved without relying on an earthed metal casing. This is usually achieved at least in part by having at least two layers of insulating material between live parts and the user, or by using reinforced insulation. In Europe, a double insulated appliance must be labelled Class II or double insulated or bear the double insulation symbol: ‚ßà (a square inside another square). Insulated AC/DC power supplies (such as cell-phone chargers) are typically designated as Class II, meaning that the DC output wires are isolated from the AC input. The designation \\"Class II\\" should not be confused with the designation \\"Class 2\\", as the latter is unrelated to insulation (it originates from standard UL 1310, setting limits on maximum output voltage/current/power). Class III Class III symbol A Class III appliance is designed to be supplied from a separated extra-low voltage (SELV) power source. The voltage from a SELV supply is low enough that under normal conditions a person can safely come into contact with it without risk of electrical shock. The extra safety features built into Class I and Class II appliances are therefore not required. For medical devices, compliance with Class III is not considered sufficient protection, and further more-stringent regulations apply to such equipment.

History for Unix-like systems is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in Version 1 AT&T; Unix. The version of bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund, David MacKenzie, and Paul Eggert. Usage The Single UNIX Specification specifications for are: df [-k] [-P-t] [-del] [file...] ; :Use 1024-byte units, instead of the default 512-byte units, when writing space figures. ; :Use a standard, portable, output format ; :If XSI compliant, show allocated space as well ; :Display in more easily human readable units such as KB, MB, GB or TB. ; :Write the amount of free space of the file system containing the specified file Most Unix and Unix-like operating systems add extra options. The BSD and GNU coreutils versions include , where free space is listed in human readable format, adding units with the appropriate SI prefix (e.g. 10MB), , listing inode usage, and , restricting display to only local filesystems. GNU includes as well, listing filesystem type information, but the GNU shows the sizes in 1K blocks by default. Specification The Single Unix Specification (SUS) specifies by original space is reported in blocks of 512 bytes, and that at a minimum, the file system names and the amount of free space. The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains compatibility with and other utilities. This does not mandate that the file system itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by the standard developers that 512 bytes was the best default unit because of its complete historical consistency on System V (versus the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a option to switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise.

On one occasion, the Modern Parents and the Critics appeared in the same strip, each pair mistakenly attending the event intended for the other, though the two strips are generally slightly different in tone and style. \\"The Social Affairs Unit's Reverend Peter Mullen has described their parenting style as: \\"These creepy, empty-headed trendies have a son who is not merely allowed to do exactly as he likes but in a perfect state of satanic permissiveness is compelled to do as he likes. This is child-abuse of the worst sort. No landmarks. No boundaries. Ultimately, therefore, no understanding of good and bad.\\" http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000712.php Malcolm and Cressida Malcolm and Cressida Wright-Pratt are parents whose obsession with ethical and environmental awareness often works against their basic role as parents to Tarquin and Guinevere. The Modern Parents do not believe in childhood activities such as fairgrounds, fast food restaurants, games, competitions and sports, toys, normal holidays or mainstream school and impose their moral positions on their children and the children of others. They take the moral high-ground because of their ideologies and expect everyone to appreciate their actions, however the two are just as hypocritical as much as they are pretentious (as displayed in one strip when they began a campaign against slavery but then employed unpaid interns to do the work for them). In the March 2008 issue of Viz they visit Uncle Eddie for his daughter Amy's second birthday party and give their niece an ethical gift, which seems (to Eddie) to be a \\"donation to an Oxfam-funded goat thingy for a starving African family\\", but turns out to be a donation to their own \\"Malcolm and Cressida Ethical Living Awareness Project\\". Tarquin and Guinevere give her a teddy bear to the dismay of Malcolm and Cressida, who declare it to be \\"an anthropomorphisation of wild animals\\", \\"an attempt to brainwash Amy into keeping pets\\" and \\"offensive and oppressive to the Sudanese people\\" (referring to the contemporary Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case). They then assume Amy will \\"at least appreciate our effort to reduce the bear's carbon footprint by putting it in the recycle bin\\" and snatch it from her. Both have large upturned noses. Cressida has her hair pulled back in a tight pony-tail and Malcolm has a scruffy beard and incredibly large teeth. Malcolm and Cressida were not originally married as they believed it to be an outmoded and sexist institution that enslaved women. However, they did eventually marry in order to get their wedding gifts. They had their own pagan ceremony and wrote their own vows (\\"Do you, Cressida, take Malcolm to be your husband so long as you find it acceptable and convenient?\\") Cressida delights in pointing out that, as a woman, she is an oppressed minority while Malcolm frequently claims he has \\"Sensitive Persons Syndrome\\". A committed environmentalist, he insists he supports public transport, but cannot use it himself because his Syndrome prevents him from getting on a bus or train and his Volvo \\"is Scandinavian, so it must be eco-friendly\\". The pair often identify themselves with ethnic minorities, claiming to have some Celtic heritage or that they were Native Americans in a previous life. Malcolm and Cressida believe that all humans are equal even to the extent that there is no such thing as immaturity. Tarquin is often greeted by the sight of his parents openly having sexual intercourse (having also previously announced this intention to their children). Each story finds them forcing their children into some new ethically aware activity that ostensibly encourages a policy of togetherness but ends up with Tarquin and Guinevere often escaping to their much more realist Uncle Eddie (Cressida's brother) who supplies them with ice creams and trips to theme parks. Malcolm has a brother, Oswald, married to Lana (real name Linda), and a neurotic spinster sister, Joy. Oswald and Lana have an extremely snobbish son, Hector James. The family are Conservative and rich, damning the British worker and the foreigner with equal vigour. Malcolm also used to be a keen Young Conservative before meeting Cressida while canvassing. Lured by Cressida into a new world of progressive ideological debate and sex, Malcolm abandoned his dreams of becoming a future Tory Prime Minister and grew a beard. One episode shows Malcolm's lock-up garage where he keeps a motorbike and a topless women calendar on the wall. He goes for a ride on the bike but is injured by Cressida, who does not know it is him and throws a protest sign at the front wheel, throwing him off. Unconscious, he imagines an alternative reality in which he has an attractive wife and is Prime Minister. Another day Cressida takes two ethically-aware friends for a tour of the house and visits Malcolm's computer den. He is caught in the den playing pornographic computer games such as \\"Deth Fuck\\" and \\"Karate Whores Must Die\\" whilst leering and salivating wildly. Cressida's family have made few appearances: her mother and father seem to be separated and her mother appears to drink. When Malcolm left her and Tarquin, Cressida wondered what she was going to do for money until Tarquin pointed out that it was always her father who sent her monthly cheques. However her father had taken a new mistress: since this meant he had no money to give to his daughter, Cressida experimented with prostitution. An early Viz character, called Mike Smitt, looks similar to the original form of Malcolm. This character is referred to as a patronising git, as all he does is talk to people as if they are stupid, or point out to the whole street that a girl on crutches is disabled and unable to speak up for herself. Tarquin and Guinevere Tarquin is the elder child, aged about twelve, often the voice of common sense, a very effective foil to Malcolm & Cressida due to his desire for normality or to make money. His diplomatic ability is a means of resistance to parental authority diametrically opposed to their schemes: he is calculating and methodical in his manipulation of Malcolm & Cressida. He has a rational, scientific worldview that rejects vague ideas about spirituality and seems grounded in evidence and deductive reasoning. As a result, he is very sceptical about ideas such as crystal healing or rebirthing, questioning their rational basis, even asking a practitioner of \\"Wan-Ki\\": \\"Where did you get your diploma, University of Mumbo-Jumbo?\\" When Malcolm and Cressida take him to a \\"Whole Self Centre\\", claiming that he suffers from an \\"erotic shame complex\\", Tarquin talks of a workshop about discovering the inner child. He gets the attendees to undress and touch each other, dance, and feel each other's bodies while several smartly dressed businessmen queue and pay to watch through the windows. It's a front for a sleazy peep show. Despite his female name, Guinevere is a boy. Wanting to avoid gender stereotyping, Malcolm and Cressida occasionally try to make one or both of their sons wear girls' clothes or take \\"female\\" roles in some psychobabble ceremony. Guinevere was born during the course of the comic strip and after growing to his current age of about five or six, stopped there. Tarquin appeared to get older in the early years of Modern Parents and in one episode turned thirteen. Guinevere, whose name is usually just shortened to \\"Guin\\" by his brother, is largely a passive character, easily upset, his big brother often coming to his rescue. Guinevere's first word was football although Malcolm and Cressida were keen for it to be dolphin. Other characters Malcolm and Cressida have many friends, notably Ashley and Cordelia in the Ethically Aware Parents Support Group, who, like them, are middle-class, politically correct and often into various causes. Most of them have children who, without exception, have the same despairing and uncooperative attitude towards their parents as Tarquin and Guinevere. Cressida's brother, Edward - more commonly known as simply Uncle Eddie - acts as a counter-weight to his sister and brother-in-law and treats his two nephews, Tarquin and Guinevere, like normal boys. 'Guest' characters include Dr Earnest Rabbitt (who is firmly opposed to killing animals) and Professor Ruth Lesscow (an extreme women's rights activist). In earlier episodes of the strip, Tarquin had a friend called Ian, of whom his parents clearly disapproved, and once a girlfriend called Dawn, of whom Malcolm and Cressida thought Tarquin was controlling and possessive.

The university is a primarily undergraduate, residential university with approximately 4,350 undergraduate and graduate students in five schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business, the Jepson School of Leadership Studies, the University of Richmond School of Law and the School of Professional & Continuing Studies. History Founded by Virginia Baptists in 1830 as a manual labor institute for men wishing to become ministers, with instruction begun by the Rev. Edward Baptist, an 1813 graduate of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, the school was incorporated ten years later as Richmond College. After 1834, the Columbia House was the main academic building of Richmond College. During the American Civil War, the entire student body formed a regiment and joined the Confederate army. Richmond College's buildings were used as a hospital for Confederate troops and later as a barracks for Union soldiers. The college invested all of its funds in Confederate war bonds, and the outcome of the war left it bankrupt. In 1866, James Thomas donated $5,000 to reopen the college. The T.C. Williams School of Law opened in 1870. In 1894, the college elected Dr. Frederic W. Boatwright president. President Boatwright would serve for 51 years. He is most remembered for raising the funds needed to move the college in 1914 from its original downtown location to a new 350-acre campus in what is now Westhampton area of Richmond, and in doing so created Westhampton College for women. The university's main library, Boatwright Memorial Library, is named in Boatwright's honor. Symbolically, the library and its soaring academic gothic tower occupy the highest spot on the grounds. Its grounds were landscaped in 1913, by Warren H. Manning under the supervision of Charles Gillette. The institution was renamed University of Richmond in 1920 with the men's college renamed Richmond College. The distinction of colleges was phased out in the late 20th century, but the respective parts of the campus continue to be referred to as the Westhampton and the Richmond \\"sides\\". \\"Richmond College\\" in 1915, shortly after the transition to Richmond's West End. Rummell, Richard (1848-1924).\\"Arader Galleries Iconic College Views\\" , Rummell, Richard, Littig & Co. 1915 In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, followed by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962. In 1969, when financial issues threatened closing the university or turning it over to the Commonwealth of Virginia, E. Claiborne Robins Sr., a trustee and alumnus, donated $50 million to the university, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time. In constant dollars, it remains among the largest. Robins' goal was to make Richmond one of the best private universities in the country. In partnership with the university's president E. Bruce Heilman and development director H. Gerald Quigg the $10 million matching grant component of the gift raised over an additional $60 million, making the university's total endowment at the time one of the highest in the country.Alley, Reuben E. History of the University of Richmond, 1830-1971. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1977.Major Private Gifts to Higher Education.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education. 2013. Accessed Feb 2, 2017. http://chronicle.com/article/Major-Private-Gifts-to-Higher/128264/ During World War II, Richmond was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In 1987, a donation of $20 million by Robert S. Jepson, Jr. facilitated the opening of the Jepson School of Leadership Studies. The school, which opened in 1992, was the first of its kind in the U.S. In 1990, the academic missions of Richmond and Westhampton Colleges were combined to form the School of Arts and Sciences. The Weinstein- Jecklin Speech Center was formed in 1996. Its purpose of The Weinstein-Jecklin Speech Center is to offer assistance to those who wish to pursue effective speaking and articulate behavior across academic disciplines. On October 15, 1992, presidential candidates George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot came to campus for the first-ever \\"town hall\\" televised presidential debate, viewed by 200 million people worldwide. Addressing a crowd of nearly 9,000, President Obama visited the University of Richmond to present the American Jobs Act on September 11, 2011. On, February 23, 2015, the University of Richmond announced to the student body via email that the board of trustees elected Ronald Crutcher as the 10th president of the university. He took office 1 July 2015, and his inauguration ceremony was held at the Robins Center on 30 October 2015. The Henry Mansfield Cannon Memorial Chapel, North Court, and Ryland Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Schools =School of Arts & Sciences= All Richmond undergraduate students begin their course work in the School of Arts & Sciences (A&S;), which offers 38 majors and 10 concentrations in the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities. After one full year of study, students may decide to pursue majors in the other undergraduate schools, though 70 percent of students choose to remain in A&S.; Opportunities abound in the School of Art & Sciences, as students have the chance to study abroad and pursue internships or research while gaining an education that will prepare them for a variety of careers or graduate programs. =Robins School of Business= The Robins School of Business was established in 1949 and offers undergraduate, graduate and executive education programs. It is named after alumnus E. Claiborne Robins. Ranked 12th nationally overall and tied for first in academic quality by BusinessWeek,Robins School of Business jumps to No. 12 among America's top undergraduate programs in 2009 BusinessWeek rankings the Robins School is the only fully accredited, top-ranked undergraduate business school that also is part of a top-ranked liberal arts university. In the 2009 BusinessWeek review of part-time MBA programs, the Robins school ranked 3rd in the mid-Atlantic region and 17th nationwide. Admission into the Robins School of Business is granted to students who have completed basic Accounting, Economics and Math courses at the end of three semester while maintaining a Grade Point Average of 2.7 or higher. =Jepson School of Leadership Studies= The Jepson School of Leadership Studies was founded to address a perceived need in the modern world for the academic study of leadership. The school blends a curriculum of economics, history, literature, philosophy, politics, psychology and religion so that students can learn conceptual tools that support the exercise of leadership in varied settings. As of 2016, the Jepson School remains as the only school of its kind in the United States that is completely devoted to the study of leadership. =School of Law= Chartered in 1840, Richmond College was only 30 years old when it added a Law Department. The initial years were very successful for the new Law Department but during the difficult financial times that followed the Civil War, legal education was intermittent at Richmond College until 1890. In that year, the family of the late T.C. Williams, Sr., endowed a Professorship of Law, thus assuring the continuous teaching of law at Richmond College. The law school was granted membership in the Association of American Law Schools in 1930 and now enrolls approximately 500 full-time students and has 4,300 active alumni. =School of Professional and Continuing Studies= The School of Professional & Continuing Studies was established in 1962. It offers degree and certificate programs, enrichment opportunities, professional training, and college course work for part-time and non-traditional students of all ages. A variety of evening programs with credit and non-credit courses make it possible for those with busy schedules to further their education or explore new interests. The school was originally named University College and included both a two-year junior college and an evening division. It was located on the original location of Richmond College on the corner of Grace and Lombardy Streets in Richmond's Fan district. In 1974, the school moved from the Columbia Building at Grace & Lombardy to the main campus in Richmond's West End. In 1994, the school was renamed the School of Continuing Studies in alignment with names of the other schools of the university. In 2012, it was renamed the School of Professional & Continuing Studies to better reflect the character of its students and the nature of its programs. Undergraduate academics Boatwright Memorial Library bell tower All students must complete general education requirements as part of the liberal arts curriculum. These requirements include a freshman seminar that all first-year students must complete. Other general education requirements include expository writing, wellness, foreign language, and one class each in six fields of study. Richmond offers more than 100 majors, minors, and concentrations in three undergraduate schools‚Äîthe School of Arts and Sciences, the Robins School of Business, and the Jepson School of Leadership Studies. The School of Continuing Studies, primarily an evening school focused on part-time adult students, offers additional degree programs in selected areas. =Admissions= The University of Richmond admitted 28.3 percent of applicants for the class of 2023. The 837-member class of 2023 has a middle 50 percent range for SAT scores of 1370-1500 and a middle 50 percent range for ACT scores of 31-34. =Rankings= In its \\"America's Best Colleges 2021\\" issue, U.S. News & World Report ranked Richmond tied for 22nd overall among national liberal arts colleges, tied for 18th \\"Most Innovative\\", and the 25th \\"Best Value\\". The Princeton Review named Richmond No. 3 for Best-Run College, No. 4 Best Career Services, No. 4 Best Schools for Internships, No. 5 Best Classroom Experience, and No. 8 Most Beautiful Campus in its 2019 edition of The Best 384 Colleges. Kiplinger ranked Richmond 18th among the \\"Best Private Colleges\\" in the U.S. for 2018. Richmond was ranked 8th by SmartMoney in the category \\"Best Private Colleges of 2011\\", leaving two Ivy League Universities behind in the top 10. BusinessWeek ranked the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business as the 12th best undergraduate program in the nation in 2009. In 2015, Time magazine's Money section named Richmond among \\"the top 10 colleges with the most generous financial aid.\\" In 2019, Richmond was ranked as the 20th best liberal arts college in America by Niche. In 2016 and 2017, the University of Richmond was ranked second for the total number of students sent to study abroad among top baccalaureate colleges according to the Institute of International Education's ‚ÄúOpen Door Report.‚Äù The University of Richmond's name leads some to believe that it is a public institution drawing students primarily from within Virginia. However, only about 15 percent of UR's undergraduate students are from Virginia. The University of Richmond draws many students from the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, but also from across the country and abroad. =Financial aid= Richmond administers a generous financial aid program, with more than 60 percent of all students receiving some form of financial assistance. Richmond offers a need-blind admissions policy that does not consider an applicant's ability to pay in the admission decision, and it pledges to meet 100 percent of an admitted domestic student's demonstrated need. Richmond also offers 50 merit-based, full tuition scholarships to students in each entering class (approximately 1 out of every 15 students). Richmond also caps student loan debt depending on the year of the student. A senior has the highest cap at $7,500 per year, whereas a freshman cannot take a loan more than $5,500. Recently, to encourage enrollment from Virginia residents, admitted students from Virginia with family incomes of $60,000 or less receive full-tuition/room and board financial aid packages without loans. Richmond's financial aid program is due, in no small part, to its endowment of over $2 billion, placing it within the top 40 nationally among college and university endowments. =Student research= The University of Richmond offers numerous research opportunities for students. In addition to research-based courses, independent studies, and practicums in most disciplines, many special opportunities exist for students to participate in close research collaborations with faculty. Student research occurs in all academic areas, including the arts, sciences, social sciences, and other fields. Notably, the university recently received a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation for its mathematics program to sponsor student research commencing May 2007.National Science Foundation Awards $1.49 Million Grant to University of Richmond Math Department The University of Richmond is listed in U.S. News and World Report's \\"America's Best Colleges 2008\\" issue as one of 35 (out of 2,500) \\"schools with outstanding examples of academic programs that are believed to lead to student success\\" in the area of \\"undergraduate research/creative projects.\\" In 2019 Richmond produced the 4th most Fulbright Scholars out of American undergraduate institutions. Student life Richmond has over 165 student organizations. Student groups include those devoted to: *Academic interests: (Phi Beta Kappa; WILL*, formerly Women Involved in Learning and Living; Model United Nations), *Student government: (Richmond College Student Government Association and Westhampton College Government Association) *Media: The Collegian, student newspaper published since 1914; Forum Magazine, a student magazine published in 2013; WDCE, campus radio station; The Messenger, annual arts and literary magazine); *Community service: (Bonner Scholars, Habitat for Humanity, Alpha Phi Omega, Volunteer Action Council (VAC)), *Club sports: (Richmond Equestrian Team, Richmond Crew, Richmond Ice Hockey Club, Richmond Men's and Women's Soccer, Richmond Co-Ed Swimming, Richmond Synchronized Swimming, Richmond Quidditch, Ultimate Frisbee Club, Richmond Archery Club University of Richmond Rugby Football Club) *Religion: The Office of the Chaplaincy is home to 18 different campus ministries and hosts many different services and events for staff, faculty, and students. The mission of the Office of the Chaplaincy is to \\"Inspire generous faith and engage the heart of the University.\\" *Performing arts: (including four a cappella groups: The OctƒÅves, Choeur du Roi, The Sirens, and Off The Cuff; and a student run Improv Comedy Troupe, Subject to Change, which performs free shows on campus several times a year and has also performed at festivals across the mid-Atlantic) *Culture and diversity: (Ngoma African Dance Company, Multicultural Student Union, SCOPE for the LGBTQ+ community, Russian and Slavic Cultural Organization, Cultural Advisors) Richmond also has an active Greek life with 15 national fraternities and sororities. The fraternities include Theta Chi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Order, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda Chi Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and the founding chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon. The Upsilon Gamma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha was the first historically black fraternity to be chartered on Richmond's campus. The sororities are Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi. About 50 percent of the women and over 30 percent of the men participate in the Greek system. The University of Richmond is home to one known secret society RS (University of Richmond). Made up of Richmond College students, the Society is known for its markings on campus and its dedication to University school spirit and camaraderie. From 1990‚Äì2003, the Shanghai Quartet served as quartet-in-residence at UR, and their relationship with the university continues with their roles as Distinguished Visiting Artists. In 2004, contemporary music sextet eighth blackbird (spelled in all lowercase) was named ensemble-in-residence. Camp Concert Hall, located on campus, is a favorite recording venue for National Public Radio. =Traditions= Noted University of Richmond traditions include: an honor code administered by student honor councils; Investiture and Proclamation Night, ceremonies for first year men and women to reflect on their next four years; Ring Dance, a dance held at the Jefferson Hotel by the junior class women; and Pig Roast, a large annual event held during the spring semester which draws significant gatherings of current students and alumni to the fraternity lodges and have featured musical acts such as Flo Rida and Afroman. Another long-standing Richmond tradition is the crowning of the largest goose on Westhampton Lake with the title \\"Triceragoose.\\" This establishes that goose as the king of the lake, ruling over all ducks, geese, and freshmen. =International education= In the past decade, the university has sought to develop a stronger international focus. International students from about 70 countries represent about 7 percent of the student body. Approximately half of undergraduate students participate in one of 78 study abroad programs offered by the university. Other international programs include Global House, a residential program housed in Keller Hall, and an international film series. In 2014, the Office of International Education at the university created the International Student Advisory Board, a group of students dedicated to working with administration to improve the overall experience of international students on campus. Alumna Carole Weinstein recently donated $9 million toward the construction of a new building on campus, opened in the fall of 2010, dedicated to international education. Campus =Main campus= The University of Richmond's campus consists of in a suburban setting on the western edge of the city. Most of the campus lies within the city limits; a small section of the south campus, including the Special Programs Building (home to the student health center and the campus police), intramural sports fields, and most of the campus apartments, lies within Henrico County.Compare this online UR campus map with the City of Richmond's official parcel map . The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus‚Äîred brick buildings in a collegiate gothic style set around shared open lawns. Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by Ralph Adams Cram in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for Princeton, Cornell, Rice, and Williams, among other universities. Warren H. Manning, a former apprentice to Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the original landscape plan. The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil. In 2000, the campus was recognized by The Princeton Review as the most beautiful in the United States. Looking out over Westhampton Lake from Tyler Haynes Commons The University of Richmond campus was used to film portions of the pilot of the ABC TV series Commander in Chief, and lead character Mackenzie Allen (played by Geena Davis) served as chancellor of a fictionalized University of Richmond prior to her election as Vice President of the United States. Much of the movie Cry Wolf was filmed on the Westhampton side of campus, with several dormitories, including South Court, North Court, and Keller Hall, serving as locations. An episode of the television show Dawson's Creek was filmed on campus, which served as an unnamed \\"beautiful Ivy League campus.\\" The filming itself took place in locations throughout the campus, even including rowing on Westhampton Lake. The University of Richmond owns the former Reynolds Metals Executive Office Building, a gift-purchase from Alcoa in 2001. Located a few miles from campus, the building was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and opened in 1958. The building, which incorporates nearly 1.4 million pounds of aluminum, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It currently serves as the headquarters of Altria Group and its subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, which lease it from the university.Philip Morris USA Headquarters to Relocate from New York to University of Richmond's Alcoa-Reynolds Building In early 2001, the university finalized the purchase of of land in eastern Goochland County, a few miles from the main campus. The land is currently used for biology research, but future uses could include intramural athletic fields. The University of Richmond campus used to be home to the Virginia Governor's School for Visual and Performing Arts and Humanities during the summer. =UR Downtown= The university also operates UR Downtown, a downtown campus of sorts occupying leased space within a larger building at 626 East Broad street. Despite its small size, UR Downtown hosts the Richmond on Broad caf√© (owned and operated by the university), a mixed-purpose lower-level, art gallery spaces, offices, two classrooms, and a conference room. Located in the city's Arts District, UR Downtown also participates in the monthly art festival, First Fridays. Moreover, the space hosts multiple exhibits each year, often in collaboration with local organizations. The UR Downtown conference room is also home to an original 1956 sgraffito style mural by Hans E. Gassman, created for the bank that occupied the building in the past. Other than art, UR Downtown serves as a VITA site, providing free tax assistance to low-income families. The spaces inside UR Downtown are made available to advocacy and non-profit organizations in need of meeting space. The Caricco Center for Pro Bono law service, the Richmond Families Initiative, and Partners in the Arts also operate out of UR Downtown. Athletics The university won its first national championship in 1982 when women's tennis won the AIAW national championship. The university won its first NCAA national championship in any sport on December 19, 2008, when the Spiders football team defeated the Montana Grizzlies 24‚Äì7 in the NCAA Division I Football Championship (which is exclusively for teams in the Football Championship Subdivision, the second tier of NCAA Division I football). Richmond was ranked 23rd in men's basketball at one point during the 2009‚Äì10 season. During its 2010 season the Richmond Men's Cross Country team placed 24th at the NCAA Division I Cross Country Championships. The 2010-11 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team won the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, earning the team a spot in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The Spiders fell to Kansas in the Sweet Sixteen.

The founder of school was the Wesleyan Missionary Rev. George Bough. in 1882, it was renamed Richmond College. Latin, Mathematics, Science, Arts and Religion were included in the curriculum, and children were trained to sit for British public examinations. The first College magazine was published in 1887. It was only the second occasion that a school in Ceylon had produced a magazine. The same year, the English Literary Union was formed and cricket was started in the school. In 1894, under the principal-ship of Rev. Horatius Hartley, the Richmond College Old Boys' Association was formed. Another important occurrence during that year was the establishment of the College Cadet Corps. Main Hall Rev. James Horne Darrel assumed duties as principal in 1896. The school experienced both physical expansion as well as qualitative growth. During his period, Richmond rose to be recognized as one of the best schools in the island. At the local University of Cambridge Examinations of 1905, Richmond earned top position among assisted schools and second place among all schools in Ceylon. The same year, the Richmond-Mahinda Cricket Encounter was played for the first time, with the two Principals, Rev. Darrell of Richmond and Mr. F. L. Woodward of Mahinda College, officiating as umpires. Rev. Darrell sacrificed his life for the college nursing the pupils who were afflicted with 'Typhoid' when there was an outbreak in the country and was buried at the Dadalla Cemetery, Galle. The Rev. W. J. T. Small became principal following the death of Rev. Darrell. Reverends Darrell and Small are the only two Principals of Richmond who have been buried side by side and it is a sad coincidence that both these great Principals met with their deaths under tragic circumstances; former due to Typhoid fever and the latter due to an accident. Commerce was introduced as a subject in 1912. This was also the year in which Football was started at Richmond. In 1915, the 2nd Galle (Richmond) Scouts Group was established. Scouting at Richmond College enjoyed remarkable success from the beginning. The first two King's Scouts in the island were produced by Richmond. In 1916, Ceylon's first Cub Pack was started at Richmond College. A notable event during the Rev. Small's period was the formation of the National Association at Richmond in 1915. It was in effect a forum within the school for the emerging nationalist movement. In 1922, Rev. Alec Sneath took over the reins of Richmond College. He was responsible for many measures which brought refinement and qualitative development to the school. In 1926, a well-equipped library was established in a new building. The Science Society was started the same year. In 1931, the Sinhala Literary Union came into being. In 1940, the last of the missionary principals left, leaving the school in the hands of local graduates. Mr. E. R. de Silva, an old boy (alumni) of the school, had the distinction of becoming the first Ceylonese principal of Richmond College. This was a period which saw major changes in the educational structure of Ceylon. The Free Education Scheme which was devised by Mr. C. W. W. Kannangara, an illustrious old boy of Richmond College, was being implemented, and the school had to be geared to suit the changes. The history of Richmond are from original Mission Records held in the Methodist Mission Library, in Colombo and in England. In 1962, Richmond College, which was owned by the Methodist Mission, was vested in the government with no compensation to the Mission. Mr. D. G. Welikala, the first head of Richmond College under state management, was also its first Buddhist principal. With the takeover, the Methodist Vernacular School on Richmond Hill was amalgamated with Richmond. This school was referred to as the \\"Kaha Iskole ( ‡∂ö‡∑Ñ ‡∂â‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑ù‡∂Ω‡∑ö )\\" by some and \\"Pin Iskole (‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂Ç ‡∂â‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑ù‡∂Ω‡∑ô )\\" meaning Charity school by others has been in existence from the time the Missionaries established a learning seat on Richmond Hill in 1858. During this period, considerable expansion and change had to take place to cater to the new situation. Richmond College faced the challenge of transition so successfully that the then Minister of Education commended Richmond on several occasions, describing it as a model institution among nationalised schools. Richmond College was one of the first schools in the island to start the teaching of Agriculture as a subject. In 1969, it became the first school in the country to start an Agricultural stream for the Advanced Level. In 1976, the College celebrated its centenary of upgrading. In terms of the provisions of the White Paper on Education, Richmond College was named as a National School in 1986. Richmond College Old Boys' Association was incorporated in 1998 by Act #04 of Parliament of Sri Lanka.

The Morse‚ÄìPalais lemma, one of the key results in Morse theory, is named after him, as is the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence, an infinite binary sequence with many applications. In 1933 he was awarded the B√¥cher Memorial Prize for his work in mathematical analysis. Biography He was born in Waterville, Maine to Ella Phoebe Marston and Howard Calvin Morse in 1892. He received his bachelor's degree from Colby College (also in Waterville) in 1914. At Harvard University, he received both his master's degree in 1915 and his Ph.D. in 1917. He taught at Harvard, Brown, and Cornell Universities before accepting a position in 1935 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained until his retirement in 1962. He spent most of his career on a single subject, now known as Morse theory, a branch of differential topology. Morse theory is a very important subject in modern mathematical physics, such as string theory. Marston Morse should not be confused with Anthony Morse, famous for the Morse‚ÄìSard theorem.

Although Racer started out as a driving simulator, it also has features that are usually seen in racing games, such as racing against AI cars, or against human opponents in multiplayer mode. Its weak points, when compared with commercial racing games, is the absence of wear/damage physics or a career mode.  History  Racer was first released on 29 August 2000. Over the years, a community has grown around Racer. The software itself is maintained exclusively by creator Ruud van Gaal. An important characteristic of Racer is its openness the formats for cars, tracks and other data are documented. Furthermore, tools to aid in car and track creation are part of the release. As a result, a large number of cars has been created and published, in a large variety: Formula One, GT, vintage, trucks, daily drivers, luxury sedans...even a shopping trolley has been modeled. Likewise, tracks are available in various types, from true racing circuits to drag strips, mountain roads, and even a car park. The main forum for Racer is at RaceDepartment Forums.  Licensing  The Racer software is free, in the sense of freeware for non-commercial users. While the source code of an older version (0.5) was made available under GPL, Racer source code will be published by Ruud van Gaal on amiga.org (05-09-2003) later versions are not under an open-source license. The cars and tracks have various forms of license, but can all be downloaded for free. Whilst one of the strengths of Racer is its open file format, perhaps one of its weaknesses is its closed- source stance and development team. The Racer community contributes to testing and suggesting features that should be added, but the development side of Racer is very much based on the amount of time the developers have to contribute towards it. This translates to infrequent updates of varying quality, but updates are often very feature-rich and inspire a new burst of energy into the development and modification of cars and tracks.

Formerly part of the territory of Cleonae in ancient Argolis, it is today situated in the regional unit of Corinthia. The small village of Archaia Nemea (formerly known as \\"Koutsoumadi\\"Sutton 2003:181 (see below). and then \\"Iraklion\\") is immediately southwest of the archaeological site, while the new town of Nemea lies to the west. Here, in Greek mythology, Heracles overcame the Nemean Lion, and here, during Antiquity, the Nemean Games were held (ending c. 235 BC) and were celebrated in the eleven Nemean odes of Pindar. Myth, legend and history The apodyterium near the stadion Temple of Zeus In Greek mythology, Nemea was ruled by king Lycurgus and queen Eurydice. Nemea was famous in Greek myth as the home of the Nemean Lion, which was killed by the hero Heracles,In the late 2nd century CE, the traveller Pausanias was shown the lion's cave, fifteen furlongs from the sanctuary (Pausanias, Description of Greece, II.15.2‚Äì.4). and as the place where the infant Opheltes, lying on a bed of parsley, was killed by a serpent while his nurse Hypsipyle fetched water for the Seven against Thebes on their way from Argos to Thebes. The Seven founded the Nemean Games in his memory, according to its aition, or founding myth, accounting for the crown of victory being made of parsley or the wild form of celery and for the black robes of the judges, interpreted as a sign of mourning. The Nemean Games were documented from 573 BC, or earlier, at the sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea.They were informally revived in 1996 (Miller 2000, below) At the temenos, the grave of Opheltes was surrounded by open-air altars and enclosed within a stone wall. The sanctuary's necessary spring was named Adrasteia: Pausanias wondered whether it had the name because an \\"Adrastos\\" had \\"discovered\\" it, but Adrasteia, the \\"inescapable one\\", was a nurse of the infant Zeus in Crete. The tumulus nearby was credited as the burial mound of his father, and the men of Argos had the privilege of naming the priest of Nemean Zeus, Pausanias was informed when he visited in the late 2nd century CE. In his time the temple, which he noted was \\"worth seeing\\", stood in a grove of cypresses; its roof had fallen in and there was no cult image within the temple. Three limestone columns of the Temple of Nemean Zeus of about 330 BC have stood since their construction, and two more were reconstructed in 2002.Stephen G. Miller, \\"The Temple of Nemean Zeus: a California landmark\\", Chronicle of the University of California, Fall 2000:127ff As of late 2007, four more are being re-erected.The re-erection of some columns by the University of California at Berkeley is described in Miller 2000. Three orders of architecture were employed at this temple, which stands at the end of the Classic period and presages this and other developments of Hellenistic architecture, such as the slenderness (a height of 6.34 column diameters) of the Doric columns of the exterior.Miller 2000. The site around the temple has been excavated in annual campaigns since 1973: the great open-air altar, baths, and ancient accommodations for visitors have been unearthed. The temple stands on the site of an Archaic period temple, of which only a foundation wall is still visible. The stadion has recently been discovered. It is notable for its well-preserved vaulted entrance tunnel, dated to about 320 BC, with ancient graffiti on the walls. The material discovered in the excavations is on display in an on-site museum constructed as a part of the University of California's excavations. In 2018, archaeologists discovered a large, intact tomb dating to the early Mycenaean era (1650‚Äì1400 B.C.). =The Battle of the Nemea River= In 394 BC the Battle of the Nemea River was fought between Sparta and her allies the Achaians, Eleians, Mantineians, and the Tegeates against a coalition of Boetians, Euboeans, Athenians, Corinthians, and Argives. This was to be the last clear- cut victory that Sparta enjoyed. The tactics were similar to all other Greek hoplite battles, except that when the armies were arrayed, with the Spartans having the customary honour of being on the right, the army drifted right as it advanced. This was not good for the Spartan allies, as it exposed the soldiers to a flanking attack, but it gave the Spartans the opportunity to use their superior coordination and discipline to roll up the flank of the Athenians, who were stationed opposite. The result of the battle was a victory for Sparta, even though her allies on the left suffered significant losses. This willingness to accept losses on the left flank for flanking position on the right was a dramatic change from typical conservative hoplite military tactics.

History The station began its life as KFM, initially as a pirate local radio station based in Stockport and broadcasting to the South Manchester/North Cheshire area on 94.2 mHz and then on 1017 kHz. KFM ran during the 1980s and then relaunched legitimately as one of the first 'incremental' local commercial stations in 1990, set up to provide more localised and specialised programming. Stoke-on-Trent based Signal Radio assumed control of the station, following difficulties in its latter incarnation, and KFM became memorable almost solely for its 7:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m. Night-time KFM output. This combined local and global new indie music with innovative DJing. Presenters on air at this time include Craig Cash, Caroline Aherne , Jon Ronson, Terry Christian and Neil Cossar, all of which have gone on to forge successful careers in the media and performing arts. KFM was succeeded by Signal Cheshire. Imagine FM is now trading as an independent radio station since it was bought from UTV Radio in January 2009. =Signal Cheshire= In 1990 a new service was launched, in Cheshire, on 96.4 FM called Echo 96. In 1991, this was renamed Signal Cheshire upon the acquisition of the KFM 104.9 transmitter. Based in Stockport, Signal Cheshire targeted the surrounding area of South Manchester and much of Cheshire, opting into networked programming from the Stoke-on-Trent site by night. There was a further change of identity in 1997 to Signal FM. In 2000, Imagine FM became the new rebranded service on 104.9 and 96.4, and when the 104.9 frequency was readvertised, the then-owners of both stations, The Wireless Group, decided that the 96.4 transmitter should return to Signal One. The station uses the tag line Cheshire's No.1 More Music Station and prides itself on updating the area on local news and information. The transmitter is based close to Stockport town centre. =Sale= On Wednesday 21 May 2008, Ofcom rejected a request by UTV to co-locate the station to Warrington alongside three of its stations. As a result of Ofcom's decision, UTV placed Imagine FM up for sale in June 2008, stating that if a buyer cannot be found by 30 June 2008 then the stations licence would be handed back to Ofcom. The station was sold by former Imagine owners UTV Radio in January 2009 and now trades as Imagine FM Limited. After 20 years of the 104.9 wavelength being based at Regent House, Stockport, Imagine FM moved to Waterloo Place, Stockport in November 2010 and now broadcasts from the legendary Strawberry Studios. The transmitter was also relocated from Romiley to Stockport centre at the same time.

It was a area in the Karkh district of central Baghdad, Iraq, that was the governmental center of the Coalition Provisional Authority during the occupation of Iraq after the American-led 2003 invasion and remains the center of the international presence in the city. Its official name beginning under the Iraqi Interim Government was the International Zone, though Green Zone remains the most commonly used term. The contrasting Red Zone refers to parts of Baghdad immediately outside the perimeter, but was also loosely applied to all unsecured areas outside the off-site military posts. Both terms originated as military designations.  History  The Green Zone was a heavily fortified zone in the center of the Iraqi capital that served as the headquarters of successive Iraqi regimes. It was the administrative center for the Ba'ath Party.Allawi, Ali (2007). The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace. Yale University Press. p. 371. . The area was not originally home to the villas of government officials though it was the location of a number of military bases, government ministries, and presidential palaces inhabited by Saddam Hussein and his family.Johnson, Chalmers (2006). Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic. Metropolitan Books. p. 160. . The largest of these was the Republican Palace that was President Saddam Hussein's primary seat of power. The area is also known as Karradat Mariam, so named for a locally famous woman who helped the poor people of Baghdad. The area was taken by US military forces in April 2003 in some of the heaviest fighting during the capture of Baghdad. In the lead-up to the US invasion of Iraq, Saddam and many high status residents of the area were evacuated because of the anticipated aerial bombardment of the area by US forces. Most of the remaining residents fled as US ground forces closed in on the Iraqi capital out of a fear of arrest by Coalition forces or possible reprisals by disgruntled Iraqis.Langewiesche, William (November 2004). Welcome to the Green Zone. The Atlantic. Some of the original inhabitants who did not flee continued to live in the area but many are also undocumented squatters referred to as the \\"215 Apartments\\".Dabrowska, Karen; Hann, Geoff (2008). Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People. Bradt Travel Guides. p. 208. . Coalition airstrikes at the outset of the fighting left a sizable number of buildings in central Baghdad abandoned. The Coalition Provisional Authority administrators who arrived on the heels of the forward invading forces decided they were ideal for use by Coalition administrators. Jay Garner, head of the reconstruction team, set up his headquarters in the former Republican Palace; other villas were taken by groups of government officials and private contractors. Eventually some five thousand officials and civil contractors settled in the area. The abandoned buildings were not only attractive to Coalition forces, but also to homeless Iraqis. Among these were individuals who had lost their homes in the conflict, but most were urban poor who had been homeless or lived in slums before the war and saw moving into the abandoned houses as a sizable increase in their standard of living. They felt that since they were not Ba'athist, they had as much right to the vacated houses as the Coalition authorities. There continue to be some five thousand of these Iraqis living in the Green Zone.Filkins, Dexter (2009). The Forever War. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. p. 279. . Entry to the Green Zone was under the control of a small garrison of American troops who manned the various checkpoints. They were typically a battalion of soldiers at FOB Prosperity, under the command of the Multi-National Division ‚Äì Baghdad. Additionally, a battalion of coalition soldiers from the Republic of Georgia also manned the entry checkpoints.Nordland, Rod; Williams, Timothy (July 28, 2009). Iraq Force Soon to Be a Coalition of One. The New York Times. The Green Zone was completely surrounded by high concrete blast walls, T-Walls and barbed wire fences with access only available through a handful of entry control points, all controlled by Coalition troops.Baghdad Green Zone. GlobalSecurity.org. It is this security that made the Green Zone the safest area of Baghdad, and gave its name colloquially as \\"the bubble\\".Lipman, Jana (2008). Guant√°namo: A Working Class History Between Empire and Revolution. University of California Press. p. 221 The southern and eastern side of the zone is protected by the Tigris River ‚Äì the only entrance to the zone from this side is the Arbataash Tamuz (July 14) Bridge (named for the date that the former regime came to power).Holihan, Michael (2007). The Epiphany Deception. Xulon Press. p. 74. The Green Zone was frequently shelled by insurgents with mortars and rockets, though these attacks caused few casualties. In October 2004 it was hit by two suicide bombings, which destroyed the bazaar and the Green Zone Cafe. On April 12, 2007, a bomb went off in the Iraqi Parliament cafeteria, killing Mohammed Awad (a member of the Sunni National Dialogue Front) and injuring 22, including one of the vice presidents. The Green Zone was shelled with rocket and mortar fire almost daily from Easter 2008 until May 5, 2008, causing numerous civilian and military casualties; As stated in a USA Today article, a high percentage of the rocket and mortar fire originated in Sadr City. On April 6, 2008, two U.S. soldiers were killed and 17 more wounded when a rocket or mortar attack struck inside the Green Zone. On July 22, 2010, three Triple Canopy security guard contractors (two Ugandans and one Peruvian) were killed and 15 more wounded (including two U.S. nationals) when a rocket attack struck inside the Green Zone. Since the handover of sovereignty to Iraqis, many of the facilities in the Green Zone have been turned over to the new Iraqi government. It is still a base for western private military contractors, and home to the U.S., British, Australian and Egyptian embassies. The permanent U.S. embassy is located in the southern part of the International or \\"Green\\" Zone overlooking the Tigris River. On 1 January 2009, full control of the International Zone (formerly \\"Green Zone\\") was handed over to Iraqi security forces. On 4 October 2015, it was opened to the public with certain restrictions. On 10 December 2018, parts of the Green Zone were opened to the public without restrictions for the first time in over 15 years.

Career The group formed in late 1994 when Mark Cancellara and Mike Johnston started to buy old analogue keyboards and fx and began to rehearse making huge soundscapes. Johnston was living with Billy Bainbridge (who was in another band at the time, Supernal, also containing members of electro band sol dat) who bought himself a keyboard and joined the band. The band started gigging as support to local bands such as Pram and Broadcast. In 1997, the band was approached by Wurlitzer Jukebox who released the single, \\"Press a Key\\". On the strength of this the band was signed to Warp and, in September 1998, released the single \\"plock\\". This was tipped as one of the singles of the year by NME, Melody Maker and Dazed & Confused. An album For Beginner Piano was released in September 1999 to widespread critical acclaim. Rob Mitchell (who had originally signed the band to Warp) was diagnosed with cancer in 2001 and died in September that year. Their second album has never been officially released but has appeared on torrent and other file sharing sites on the internet. Bainbridge went on to play keyboards with Broadcast (on the 'Ha Ha Sound' tour), and is now a member of Seeland with Tim Felton (now also ex-Broadcast), and released a single \\"Wander\\" / \\"Pherox\\" on Duophonic in 2005. Johnston went on to form Mike in Mono, and is also 'Clive 2' in ZX Spectrum Orchestra and a member of the Modified Toy Orchestra. Mark Cancellara is currently a magician's assistant and DJ. Starting in the summer of 2009, Plone's song \\"Plaything\\" appeared on a Reese's Peanut Butter Cups commercial. In October 2019, it was announced that a new Plone album will be released on the Ghost Box label in 2020. On 25 February 2020 the new album was announced, named Puzzlewood and set to be released on 17 April.

It is the methyl ester of salicylic acid. It is a colorless, viscous liquid with a sweet, fruity odor reminiscent of root beer, but often associatively called \\"minty,\\" as it is an ingredient in mint candies. It is produced by many species of plants, particularly wintergreens. It is also produced synthetically, used as a fragrance and as a flavoring agent. Biosynthesis and occurrence Methyl salicylate was first isolated (from the plant Gaultheria procumbens) in 1843 by the French chemist Auguste Andr√© Thomas Cahours (1813‚Äì1891), who identified it as an ester of salicylic acid and methanol. Wintergreen plants (Gaultheria procumbens) The biosynthesis of methyl salicylate arises via the hydroxylation of benzoic acid by a cytochrome P450 followed by methylation by a methylase enzyme. Methyl salicylate is probably produced as an anti-herbivore defense. If the plant is infected with herbivorous insects, the release of methyl salicylate may function as an aid in the recruitment of beneficial insects to kill the herbivorous insects. Aside from its toxicity, methyl salicylate may also be used by plants as a pheromone to warn other plants of pathogens such as tobacco mosaic virus. Numerous plants produce methyl salicylate in very small amounts. Some plants, such as the following, produce more: some species of the genus Gaultheria in the family Ericaceae, including Gaultheria procumbens, the wintergreen or eastern teaberry; some species of the genus Betula in the family Betulaceae, particularly those in the subgenus Betulenta such as B. lenta, the black birch; all species of the genus Spiraea in the family Rosaceae, also called the meadowsweets; species of the genus Polygala in the family Polygalaceae. Commercial production Methyl salicylate can be produced by esterifying salicylic acid with methanol. Commercial methyl salicylate is now synthesized, but in the past, it was commonly distilled from the twigs of Betula lenta (sweet birch) and Gaultheria procumbens (eastern teaberry or wintergreen). Uses Chick embryo that was treated with methylene blue to stain the skeleton, then cleansed with two or three ethanol washes, and treated with methyl salicylate to make the surrounding tissues transparent Methyl salicylate is used in high concentrations as a rubefacient and analgesic in deep heating liniments (such as Bengay) to treat joint and muscular pain. Randomised double blind trials report that evidence of its effectiveness is weak, but stronger for acute pain than chronic pain, and that effectiveness may be due entirely to counterirritation. However, in the body it metabolizes into salicylates, including salicylic acid, a known NSAID. Methyl salicylate is used in low concentrations (0.04% and under)Wintergreen at Drugs.com as a flavoring agent in chewing gum and mints. When mixed with sugar and dried, it is a potentially entertaining source of triboluminescence, gaining the tendency to build up electrical charge when crushed or rubbed, which can be observed by crushing wintergreen Life Savers in a dark room. It is used as an antiseptic in Listerine mouthwash produced by the Johnson & Johnson company. It provides fragrance to various products and as an odor-masking agent for some organophosphate pesticides. Methyl salicylate is also used as a bait for attracting male orchid bees for study, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones, and to clear plant or animal tissue samples of color, and as such is useful for microscopy and immunohistochemistry when excess pigments obscure structures or block light in the tissue being examined. This clearing generally only takes a few minutes, but the tissue must first be dehydrated in alcohol. It has also been discovered that methyl salicylate works as a kairomone that attracts some insects, such as the spotted lanternfly. Additional applications include: used as a simulant or surrogate for the research of chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard, due to its similar chemical and physical properties., in restoring (at least temporarily) the elastomeric properties of old rubber rollers, especially in printers, and as a penetrating oil to loosen rusted parts. Safety and toxicity Methyl salicylate is potentially deadly, especially for young children. A single teaspoon (5 ml) of methyl salicylate contains approximately 6 g of salicylate, which is equivalent to almost twenty 300 mg aspirin tablets (5ml √ó 1.174g/ml = 5.87g). Toxic ingestions of salicylates typically occur with doses of approximately 150 mg/kg body weight. This can be achieved with 1 ml of oil of wintergreen, which equates to 140mg/kg of salicylates for a 10kg child (22lbs). The lowest published lethal dose is 101 mg/kg body weight in adult humans,Safety data for methyl salicylate , Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, Oxford University (or 7.07 grams for a 70 kg adult). It has proven fatal to small children in doses as small as 4 ml. A seventeen-year-old cross-country runner at Notre Dame Academy on Staten Island died in April 2007 after her body absorbed methyl salicylate through excessive use of topical muscle-pain relief products. Most instances of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate are a result of over-application of topical analgesics, especially involving children. Salicylate, the major metabolite of methyl salicylate, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in an autopsy.

Subsequent lineups have changed frequently, most notably with Cuckston's departure in 2008. Their electronic pop sound, described by AllMusic as \\"equally quaint and unsettling,\\" employs unconventional instruments and draws on stylistic influences such as krautrock, exotica, and dub. The group signed to Too Pure Records in 1993, where they released their debut LP The Stars Are So Big, The Earth Is So Small... Stay as You Are. They later signed to Domino. Following the 2007 album The Moving Frontier, they took a lengthy hiatus, returning in 2018 with Across the Meridian. History =Early years= Rosie Cuckston, Matt Eaton and Andy Weir grew up together as schoolmates in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. In the late 1980s Cuckston and Eaton moved to Birmingham, where Cuckston met Shropshire-born Samantha \\"Sam\\" Owen by chance (at a local supermarket's Singles Night). Weir had moved to London to study art, but kept in touch: in the meantime, Cuckston and Eaton played together in bands and got as far as recording in commercial studios, but Eaton would later recall that \\"the process didn‚Äôt lend itself to diversity and experimentation.\\"\\"A New Nineties: Part Four: Why Pram Wrote The Best Album Of The Nineties\\" - article in The Quietus by Neil Kulkarni, 22 December 2011 In 1988, Weir reunited with the other three and they began playing music together in Birmingham under the temporary name Hole (at that point, performing solely with vocals and a homemade theremin). Some time later Hole changed their name to Pram, with Cuckston singing and playing keyboards, Eaton mostly playing guitar, Weir drumming, and Owen playing bass guitar. A little later the group added a fifth member, Max Simpson, on keyboard and sampler. Over time, the various band members introduced their multi-instrumental skills to the project. Sam Owen and Matt Eaton frequently shared bass guitar and six-string guitar roles (as well as adding to the keyboards), while Owen also performed on various woodwind and reed instruments as well as singing backing vocals. The band were also quick to incorporate unusual instruments, including toys, into their sound - their performance and recording armoury included the theremin, a zither, a toy piano, a glass hammer, a glockenspiel, and a Hawaiian bubble machine. Pram's name emphasised their unearthly, childlike tone and presentation, with Rosie Cuckston's eerie vocals and lyrics dealing with depression, loneliness and the dark side of childhood. The band's early recordings had a Krautrock-influenced blend of rhythmic guitar, keyboards and percussion which would eventually see them associated with the emerging post- rock genre, as would other elements of their work (although the band have rejected the label).\\"Pram - defiantly different\\" - article by Jason Keller in NOW Magazine vol. 28 no. 8, 21‚Äì28 October 2008 The band was also inspired by multimedia and by memories of broadcast material: Sam Owen has commented that \\"in some ways film, animation, children's TV, Play For Today and public information broadcasts all lodged their spirit into our songs as much as the music we listened to.\\". In 2011, Matt Eaton recalled \\"there was never any discussion at that time what the group would sound like. We appropriated some of the working methods of Can and Faust... if a piece had a similarity/reminded someone of another work it was generally rejected. The emphasis was on new. We were inspired a lot by groups like The Slits, and especially The Raincoats. They invented their own ways of playing music - that's a surefire way towards artistic fulfilment.\\" Other cited influences on the nascent Pram included Sonic Youth, The Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, The Fall, Big Black, The Residents and Alice Coltrane as well as various dub and bhangra artists. =Too Pure years= Pram's first EP, Gash (engineered by Justin Broadrick) was self-released on their own label 'Howl Records' and sold by mail order and at gigs. While much harsher and more immediate than the band's subsequent recordings, it presented them as an inventive and dedicated experimental band and got them early attention from record labels. Pram's growing reputation soon engaged the interest of Too Pure Records (then home to Stereolab, Mouse on Mars and PJ Harvey).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 927-8 Signing to Too Pure in 1993, Pram embarked on the release of several increasingly sophisticated recordings, the first of which was the Iron Lung EP. Andy Weir left shortly after the release of the EP and was replaced as drummer by Daren Garratt, who would perform on all subsequent recordings until the dawn of the new millennium. This new line- up gelled instantly and would write, record and mix the band's debut album, 1993's The Stars Are So Big, The Earth Is So Small... Stay as You Are in time to meet their agreed, scheduled September release date. During the recording sessions, a trumpeter (credited only as \\"The Verdigris Horn\\") also joined the band and played on several album tracks, including the quarter-hour \\"In Dreams You Too Can Fly\\". In April 1994, Pram released the Meshes EP, which was followed in September by their second album Helium. This record featured increasing use of the sampler. Pram's subsequent recordings began to show a marked interest in exotica. Although their third album, 1995's Sargasso Sea, was awarded a rating of 0/10 when reviewed by the NME (which Pram took as a compliment), the band continued to gain momentum and popularity. Despite this, the band's sales were insufficient to save their business relationship with Too Pure, and the label dropped the band in late 1995. Pram have acknowledged that, despite the end of the business relationship, the label had always respected their artistic integrity and let them be themselves. =Between labels= For a couple of years, Pram performed and recorded without a long- term record deal. Their first release during this period was a 1995 self- released cassette compilation of early demos and live recordings called Perambulations. The band's next EP, Music for Your Movies, was released on November 1996 through Stereolab's label Duophonic Records. It was followed by the vinyl-only \\"Omnichord/Sixty Years of Telephony\\" single on the small independent label Wurlitzer Jukebox Records. Another non-album single, \\"The Last Astronaut\\", was released in 1997 on the Kooky label. Also in 1997, the band expanded and reissued their debut EP Gash as a full-length album on the √¶ label, adding five tracks from Perambulations and doubling the length. Pram's lineup changed several times during this period. A theremin player known only as \\"The Colonel\\" joined the band in 1996, bringing his own home-made theremin with him. By late 1997, Daren Garratt would be replaced on drums by Mark Butterworth, although pre-recorded material with Daren would continue to feature on records for the following two years. Former Long Fin Killie drummer Dave Turner would also have a stint with the band. =Domino years, Part 1= By 1998, Pram had found a new home at Domino Records (distributed by Merge Records in the US). Their fourth album, North Pole Radio Station (which had originally been recorded for release on Wurlitzer Jukebox before the label shut down) was released on Domino in March 1998. A related EP called Sleepy Sweet was released the following August. In 1998, Pram recorded the soundtrack to Martin Davies' 10-minute animated film \\"Keep in a Dry Place and Away From Children\\": in 1999, they released it as an EP including a remix by Mouse on Mars. Also in 1999, Domino collected various single and EP tracks from the previous two years and compiled them on the Telemetric Melodies compilation. This were the final recordings to feature Daren Garratt on drums (with the notable exceptions of the \\"Last Astronaut\\" 7\\", the Sleepy Sweet EP and around half of the tracks on the North Pole Radio Station album). By 2000, three new members had joined Pram - former Broadcast drummer Steve Perkins, multi- instrumentalist Nick Sales (of the long-running Birmingham performance art group Blissbody) and trumpeter Alex Clare. All three performed on the band's fifth album, The Museum of Imaginary Animals which was released in 2000. The album featured the single \\"The Owl Service\\", named after the Alan Garner book of the same name. The Somniloquy EP was released in 2001, featuring both new tracks and remixes of various recent album tracks and singles. Remix contributors were Andy Votel, fellow Brummie experimentalists Plone and Tele:funken (the latter credited as \\"Terry Funken\\"). =Domino years, Part 2= Pram's sixth album - 2003's Dark Island - proved to be more of a breakthrough in terms of the band's profile. One of its songs, \\"Track of the Cat\\", was used on a BT Group advert. A remix of \\"Simon from Sydney/Untitled 2\\", commissioned by Warp Records, was used on Volkswagen's \\"30 years in the Making\\" advertising campaign. By now, the band's lineup had changed again. While Steve Perkins had drummed on three tracks on Dark Island, he was replaced during the sessions by Laurence Hunt. Trumpeter Hannah Baines (of Misty's Big Adventure) was briefly a member of the band for live performances in 2003. In spite of the relatively greater success of Dark Island, Pram did not release a new album for another four years. In 2004, NME finally reversed their previous scathing opinion of Pram by tipping them as the next big band to watch out for. In 2006, trombonist Harry Dawes (who also played theremin and stylophone) joined the band. By this time, both Sales and Clare had left for other projects. In September 2007 Pram released their seventh studio album The Moving Frontier. It was named number 7 in Wire Magazine's Top Ten records of the year. A remix EP based on various Moving Frontier tracks, Prisoner of the Seven Pines, followed in 2008 as did a full self-released collection of the band's visual work (short films, music videos and animations), collated on a limited edition 90-minute DVD called Shadow Shows of the Phantascope Following the release of Prisoner of the Seven Pines and Shadow Shows of the Phantascope, Cuckston permanently left the band in 2008 to concentrate on academia. Pram went into a period of dormancy as far as commercial releases were concerned for almost a decade while the remaining members worked on other projects. The group collaborated with visual artist \\"Film Ficciones\\" (filmmaker Scott Johnston) on a large scale multi platform show that used early cinematic techniques, shadow-play, theater and a live musical performance in silhouette to soundtrack a three-screen film produced by Johnston and the band. The piece \\"Shadow Shows\\" premiered at Supersonic Festival Birmingham, touring to Germany and then headlining the closing day of the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2011. As Pram, the group conducted workshops in sound art and field recording, producing as yet unreleased work that was performed live in 2016. In 2012 the group recorded a series of experimental works at Jochen Hans Irmler's Klangbad Studio, with the intention of releasing a new LP of experimental works. In 2019 the editing and arranging process continued. =The Future= Now working as a semi- instrumental project, with an increased interest in film and site-specific work, the band performed at the Imaginary Musics festival in Switzerland in May 2017 (playing an audio-visual \\"Music for Kopfkino\\" set) and at a combined sound-art installation and concert ('Under the Blossom That Hangs On The Bough') in Birmingham's Martineau Gardens as part of the for-Wards project and festival for June 2017. In 2018 the band released a new album, Across the Meridian, on Domino Records \\"Pram announce new album 'Across the Meridian'\\" (Domino Records news page, 13 June 2018 (with Sam Owen now handling vocals). The album was launched at a Club Integrale Midlands concert at the Edge, on 20 July 2018, followed by concerts at The Lexington, London, on 22 July and the Soup Kitchen, Manchester, on 26 July (with Fliss Kitson of The Nightingales playing drums). Work as remixers Pram have remixed LFO and the Aphex Twin for the Warp Records 10th anniversary compilation. They have also remixed a song for the Indian singer Mohammed Rafi.Ankeny, Jason \\"Pram Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-12-31 Outside band activities Rosie Cuckston recorded songs with L√¶titia Sadier as Monade in the late 90s.

It is a form of utility bicycle commonly seen around the world, built to facilitate everyday riding in normal clothes in a variety of weather conditions.www.wired.com worlds-most- bike-friendly-cities - Consulted on 2015-02-06 It is therefore a bicycle designed for practical transportation, as opposed to those primarily for recreation and competition, such as touring bicycles, racing bicycles, and mountain bicycles. Utility bicycles are the most common form globally, and comprise the vast majority found in the developing world. City bikes may be individually owned or operated as part of a public bike sharing scheme. Generally as they are more suitable for urban environments, they focus more on comfort and practicality instead of speed or efficiency. They normally have a slightly curved, roughly planar aligned and elevated handlebar, providing users an upright sitting position. They have fewer gears and they often are heavier than road bicycles. They might have the top central frame bar diagonally aligned for allowing easy mounting in and out and they might have a back or front frame for transport of items. The saddle is typically larger compared with other bicycles and the majority are provided with chain and tire protection against oil or dirt. History A traditional Dutch roadster Bicycles have been promoted for their utilitarian strengths since before they were technically known as bicycles. The draisine and the boneshaker were hoped to become an inexpensive utilitarian alternative to horses by their makers. However the inherent danger, cost, discomfort, and restrictive gender roles of the day, kept it popular mainly with wealthy adventurous young men, and mainly for recreation and sport. The development of penny-farthing moved away from the utilitarian goal of earlier forms, with its less stable ride, and difficulty carrying much baggage. It furthered the trend of bicycles to be used by young men, willing to take risks, for sport and recreation. Despite this, we find the earliest mention of working bikes in 1874, in Paris, as couriers, for a newspaper and the stock market riding penny-farthings. It was the introduction of the safety bicycle that was successful for the first time to build a bicycle that worked well for utilitarian purposes, \\"a poor man's nag\\". It was this development that was the cause of the bicycle boom of the 1890s. The main use of bicycles during the boom was still sport and recreation, but additionally they were adopted by many professions such as police, postal workers, delivery men, municipal workers and for basic transportation of people of all classes, races, and genders. In the US, after the boom, use changed dramatically from sport and recreation to basic transportation. By 1902, as the boom was coming to an end, nearly all cyclists were cycling for practical purposes. The price of bicycles dropped dramatically, due to increased competition between makers and more price conscious consumers; profits dried up and many of the cycling manufacturers went out of business. The history is similar in the UK, but there some of the manufacturers were better able to handle the transition to transportation based cycling, even to the point of talking of a second boom due to so many working-class people taking up cycling. Additionally the British makers were able to tap into the developing markets overseas, primarily India, China, and Japan. In countries like the US, the use of utility bicycles all but disappeared until after the Second World War, when a few British and Italian roadster-type bicycles saw a brief upsurge in popularity. Since the Second World War, utility bicycles have remained popular in countries like the Netherlands, China, and much of the developing world. =Technological improvements= Since the 1890s only incremental mechanical advances have taken place for the majority of the world's utility bicycles. In fact many bicycles in Asia still employ rod brakes. One exception to this was the continued development of substitute propulsion systems for utility bicycles in the form of add-on gasoline engines and transmissions. Developed shortly after 1900 in Europe and the United States, motorized utility bicycles surged in popularity in Western Europe after the Second World War. Typically, a small one or two-horsepower, two-cycle engine was fitted with a tire roller-drive mechanism that would convert any standard utility roadster into a motorised bicycle. As they could still be propelled by human power, they were considered as bicycles under most national registration schemes. The motorised utility bicycle or cyclemotor offered greater range, faster commutes, and increased versatility to a large sector of the postwar European consumer market that could not afford expensive automobiles or motorcycles.Beare, David, Pattle, Andrew, and Wheeler, Philippa, The Stinkwheel Saga: Episode 1 Upper Cefn-y- Pwll, Montgomershire: Stinkwheel Publishing, , (2004) In 1962, the advent of the Moulton bicycle brought a fresh outlook to the traditional utility concept. Utilizing small, easily transportable frames and wheels as well as suspension, the Moulton was designed to accommodate the increasing public usage of bicycles in concert with other forms of mass transportation. During the 1990s, several bicycle designs were introduced in an attempts to improve on the traditional utility bike. Most of these centered on the use of lightweight frame alloys, new brake and gearing systems, and electronic navigation and monitoring assistance.  Use  Deutsche Post delivery bike in Cologne. Utility bicycles are principally used for short-distance commuting, running errands, shopping, leisure or for transporting goods or merchandise. Utility bicycles may also be seen in postal service, in war, and for employee transportation inside large workplaces (factories, warehouses, airports, movie studio lots, etc.). In some countries, entire fleets of utility bicycles may be operated or administered by local or national government agencies as part of a public bike sharing programme. The utility bicycle is the most widely used form of bicycle in many undeveloped parts of the world. While motor vehicles have displaced bicycles for personal transportation in many industrialized and post-industrial nations, rising fuel costs and concerns over the environment have led many people to once again turn to utility bicycles for a variety of daily tasks. In countries where purpose-built utility bikes are unavailable or unsuited to local conditions, many cyclists have acquired hybrid bicycles, road bicycles, mountain bikes, or touring bicycles for commuting and general utility use, often refurbishing older or secondhand models. A few countries, notably China, India, Netherlands, Denmark and the Flemish Region of Belgium, continue to produce versions of the utility bike. In addition, the Deutsche Post uses a version of a utility bike in most German cities for delivering mail. Design Utility bicycles often feature a step-through frame so they can be easily mounted, single speed, or with internal hub gearing, and drum brakes to reduce the need for maintenance, mudguards to keep the rider's clothing clean, a chain guard to prevent skirts or loose trousers from being caught in the chain, a skirt guard to prevent a long coat or skirt catching in the rear wheel or brakes, a center stand kickstand so it can be parked easily, and a basket or pannier rack to carry personal possessions or shopping bags. A traditional type of utility bicycle, the English roadster may weigh as much as 35 to 50 pounds (16 ‚Äì 23 kg). Parts such as frames, wheels/rims, and tires are chosen for strength, safety, and durability rather than high performance. Additionally, utility bikes tend to incorporate fewer technological advances in material design and engineering in comparison to sport bicycles, though there are exceptions. In particular, the small-tired Moulton portable utility cycles incorporate advanced engineering with relatively light weight. Most utility bikes feature an upright riding position. The handlebars are almost always curved back and positioned higher than the saddle so that the rider can operate controls without changing his or her riding posture. Some people add a child seat or a trailer. The utility bike's combination of parts, design, and features provide functionality and comfort at the expense of weight, an adequate compromise when used as originally intended (local commuting and short rides).Richard Ballantine, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book ‚Äì The Overlook Press, New York, www.overlookoress.com / (2001). pp. 27-29. Omafiets, the Dutch ladies' bicycle =\\"Stadsfiets\\" as a defining term= The Dutch term Stadsfiets is a useful starting point for defining the nature of the design, as it has the full set of features commonly incorporated into a utility bicycle. The Dutch words fiets and stadsfiets mean bicycle and city bicycle, respectively. A stadsfiets is considered to be a fully outfitted European city bike, distinguished by the following typical features: upright riding position, fully enclosed chaincase, skirtguard, O-lock, hub gearing, dynamo hub, manually operated small warning bell, and built-in lights. German and Dutch versions of the European city bike are similar, though there are differences.Duitse Versus Nederlandse Stadsfiets, Vogelvrije Fietser, January/February 2008, pp. 20-21, Article in Dutch The English roadster is similar in design, appearance, and intended use. The primary differences are that the continental bicycles tend to have a higher handlebar position for a more upright riding posture, and are more likely to have rod-actuated drum brakes. Because of Great Britain's cultural and trading influence in its former colonies, the roadster can still be seen in local production and use in many countries of the world. =Traditional vs. contemporary design= Utility bicycles are now becoming fashionable once again A traditional-styled European city bike includes a frame made of low-carbon high-tensile steel, black paint with chromed accessories, an opaque skirtguard, bottle dynamo, simple dynamo- powered lights, and either a single-speed or 3-speed internally geared hub. Contemporary city bikes are increasingly found in many European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear skirt guard, colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, Hub dynamo, dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a less is more philosophy.Duitse Versus Nederlandse Stadsfiets, Vogelvrije Fietser, January/February 2008, pp. 20-21 Contemporary- designed European city bicycle. =Suitability compared to hybrid or commuter bikes= The suitability and availability of fully outfitted city bikes depends on multiple factors, including local terrain, city density, car traffic, weather, and bicycle infrastructure. Traditional European city bikes are optimized for short-distance, frequent transportation over flat terrain in urban settings. However, such bikes are also used in hilly Switzerland, including Basel and Bern, where 23% and 15% of daily trips are made by bicycle respectively.http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/cycling/cycling_en.pdf A fully outfitted European city bike or heavy utility roadster typically weighs 35‚Äì50 pounds (16‚Äì23 kg), compared with 14‚Äì22 pounds (6‚Äì10 kg) for the average road racing bike and 22‚Äì29 pounds (10‚Äì13 kg) for the typical modern mountain bike, touring bicycle, or hybrid city bike, commuter, or cross bike.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32‚Äì35. A steel-frame European city bike with hub gear, chain case, and other features is heavier and more difficult to ride uphill than a road bike.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32‚Äì34: Ballantine writes: \\"I like [European city bikes] fine ‚Äî in the Netherlands. Pedaling them up any kind of a hill is hard work.\\" A steel-frame bike is more cumbersome to carry and store, so it might not be the best choice for commuters needing to transport their bicycles on public transportation nor cyclists living or working in upper floor residences.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 244‚Äì46. Instead, European city bikes are often locked and stored outside businesses or residences, even during inclement weather. For easier carrying and storage, makers of European city bikes provide features similar to city bikes on folding bicycles. In the Netherlands, many modern city bikes are also available with an aluminum alloy frame, significantly reducing weight to partly overcome the practical difficulties with a heavier bike. In the United States, Americans living in cities or suburbs with many days of sunshine per year have traditionally used road racing bicycles, sport/touring bicycles, or mountain bikes for general commuting or utility purposes. For all-weather use, U.S. buyers tend to purchase substantially lighter machines than the traditional Stadsfiets or utility roadster, instead choosing hybrid city bikes or commuter bikes derived from road or mountain designs. The latter frequently employ lightweight frames and wide gear ranges for use on higher-speed roadways as well as steep terrain. To save weight, some hybrid city or commuter bikes do not usually possess many accessories, adding only fenders, a rack, and perhaps a partial chainguard, as well as front and rear lights.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 32‚Äì34. Their smaller bulk and lighter weight often permits them to be carried into offices and residences, an advantage in countries with extremely high rates of bicycle vandalism and theft (even of older or obsolete models with little monetary value).Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 245‚Äì46. Most European city bikes are designed to withstand year-round outdoor storage, even in frigid Scandinavia where daily bike usage remains high year-round. Thus, European city bikes need not always be brought indoors and can be left outside, properly locked. To deter theft and vandalism, the European city bike has a tougher frame, non-quick-release seat and wheels, and a rear-wheel lock. To prevent theft or vandalism, it is ideal to bring the bike indoors, but this isn't always possible in dense cities with compact living quarters. =Lightweight variants= Much like the English sports roadster,www.sheldonbrown.com, The Golden Age of 3 Speeds ‚Äì Roadster, Sports or Club? Retrieved 2009-09-25.. a lighter-weight variant of the contemporary utility bicycle adheres to the same general approach to bike design and use, but saves weight and increases efficiency by using: * Caliper brakes instead of hub brakes * Derailleurs rather than hub gearing * A battery-based lighting system rather than a hub dynamo system * Carbon front fork * Aluminum rims and hubs, with fewer spokes * Light plastic or webbing skirt guard, or no skirtguard * No suspended seat or fork The lightweight European city bike is a popular model for Dutch brands such as Batavus and Gazelle, where high levels of bicycle use result in demand for higher performance city bicycles, which is otherwise similar to the fully outfitted typical European city bike. This is sometimes marketed as a \\"sports\\" variant of the latter. Typical features A city bike with a step-through frame is practical for easy mounting in and out. Straight sitting position focusing on comfort instead of speed. Chainguard and mudguards protect against oil or dirt. Backpack for the transport of items. =Hub gearing= A hub gear is an important feature of a European city bike. A hub gear system provides greater ease-of-use than a derailleur system due to the ability to change gear stationary, smooth changes, the ability to provide a wide range of ratios, and the requirement of little maintenance. A geared hub requires only one shifter rather than two, thus is easier to use than the pair of derailleurs which provide a greater number of speeds to sporting bicycles that need them. A European city bike or roadster typically has 3, 5, 7, 8 or 11 speeds. In a few high-end models, a Rohloff 14-speed geared hub is available. Batavus makes several models of full-featured city bikes that have a NuVinci hub with continuously variable drive ratio. The NuVinci has nearly the same range as an 8-speed hub (around 300%), selectable at any ratio within the range. With most bikes, the bicycle gearing may be scaled up or down as needed, for example by installing a smaller chainring in front and/or larger sprocket in back to facilitate climbing. Hub gearing permits the use of a fully enclosed chaincase, which minimizes the need for maintenance. A hub gear has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. A hub gear system is heavier than a derailleur system. In a hub gear system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it. =Angled-back handlebars= The angled-back handlebars (woman on the foreground) allow an erect sitting position increasing comfort, in contrast with straight handlebars (man on the background) which increase tensions on the lumbar area and shoulders. A European city bike has angled- back handlebars and an upright riding position. The handlebars, similar to the North Road style handlebars, have a moderate rise and are swept back toward the body, enabling a fully upright posture similar to a person walking. The rider is easily visible to other traffic and can easily see traffic and hazards. The handlebar's shape allows shopping bags, locks, and other items to be hung from the bars without slipping off. This reduces steering control, but that is compensated by the more stable geometry of the frame and forks. =Stable geometry= A curved fork and angled vertical tubing provides stable, non-twitchy steering, enabling the rider to ride with one hand, while freeing the other hand for signalling or to secure a load on the rear rack. Europeans commonly use the free hand to hold an umbrella or cell phone, or to hold the shoulder of a child riding their own bike, to train the child for positioning on the road. A coaster brake further enables such one-handed riding, because the one hand on the handlebar only has to steer, not also brake. A stable European city bike enables securely travelling along in a position that is as upright as walking; it feels stable and relaxed, like walking very fast. A safe city bike needs to be capable of easily turning without falling over, and needs to be capable of moving reliably with shopping bags and a lock hanging from the handlebars. =Hub dynamo, automatic lights and magnetic lights= A hub dynamo enables a built-in lighting system without the loud noise and high drag of a bottle (sidewall) dynamo, and without the unreliability, high cost, ecological disposal problem, and maintenance inherent with batteries. The hub dynamo powers LED or halogen front and rear lights. The lights have a built-in reflector. The taillight is mounted cleanly on the rear rack or fender. A built-in reflector in the headlight and taillight surrounds or is adjacent to the LED or light bulb. Built-in lights stay on point, i.e., need no adjustments. Traditional bottle dynamo and lamp The latest systems include a capacitor-powered standlight, powered for a few minutes by a capacitor. This prevents the lights from going out as soon as the bike speed drops to less than a few miles per hour; this evens out the amount of light at various speeds, sustaining the light at lower speeds. The latest systems include automatic switching based on darkness+motion detection. This prevents having to reach to physically position a bottle dynamo or consume set-up time; this enables ready, guaranteed lighting regardless of the daylight conditions. A three-position switch has positions for Off, On, and Auto. A hub dynamo prevents the usage-overhead and preparation time of attaching the headlight and taillight to the bike prior to using the bike, and prevents having to remove the headlight and taillight and carry them while the bicycle is parked in public. A built-in light system avoids a failing battery lamp and prevents getting a ticket and fine from having no lights at night. Many Danish bikes feature lights powered through electromagnetic induction. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels, eliminating the need for batteries while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos. =Front suspension with built-in headlight= A front suspension fork is common on high-end, contemporary-styled European city bikes. This is often a coil/oil or air/oil suspension fork with adjustable compression and rebound. A traditional roadster has no front suspension, or a spring-based front suspension that has more limited travel and adjustability. Some high-end models integrate the headlight into the front fork and fender assembly. This discourages vandalism, protects the wiring, and reduces the number of external wires and cables. =O-lock= Bike O Lock A built-in O-lock is a type of bicycle lock that prevents ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable. An O-lock is also called a ring lock or wheel lock. The O-lock facilitates outdoor parking, by reducing the risk that someone can steal the bike by quickly riding off on it. An O-lock is lightweight and unobtrusive. It can be locked very quickly and conveniently, such as when parking the bike outside a store while running errands. The O-lock also serves as a deterrent to ownership disputes, as the person who has the O-lock key is proven to be the owner of the bike. More recent O-locks have a slot to attach an armored cable, allowing a cyclist to lock the frame, wheels, and seat. O-locks provide a limited degree of security, like all locks.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), pp. 154-158: In some less-civilised cities of the world, bicycle locks offer little protection against thieves armed with moving vans, prybars, portable saws, and cutters to remove locks or their attachment points (posts, bike racks, etc.). Even if unsuccessful in stealing the bike, it is not uncommon for thieves to extensively damage or vandalise it, making public parking hazardous. The greatest security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft and the owner must show that they have the key, to demonstrate that the bike was locked. The key can only be removed by locking the lock. In other locations, the O-lock is used along with locking the frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.MacBike Amsterdam Safe Cycle Guide, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjNNDPXVvT0, depicts a ride-off theft at 4:50. =Skirt guard= A skirt guard (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, for both the main rider and a passenger riding on the back rack. The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase. It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes. A skirtguard prevents winter or flowing spring clothing from getting caught in the area where many features converge: the back brake, O-lock, and spokes. The skirtguard and O-lock form an integrated system. The O-lock catches clothing, so the skirtguard is needed to compensate. The O-lock passes through a hole in the skirt guard. The traditional, old-fashioned city bike has a solid (opaque) fabric skirt guard, while the contemporary European city bike has a clear plastic guard. =Fully enclosed chain guard= Riding in a dress on a bicycle with fully enclosed chain guard. A fully enclosed chain guard or chaincase enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing trouser clips or rolling up a trouser leg. A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting caught in the chain or front chainring. While newer designs may use a partial chain guard, the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured. A full chain guard also keeps the drive train (chain and external gears) clean and efficient by excluding water, mud, and grit which could splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency. To repair a rear flat tire, a fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel. =Full fenders with mudguard flaps= The fenders are aluminium or plastic, sometimes with a taillight affixed to the bottom of the back fender. The fairly low bottom of the back fender reduces road grime splashing up to a cyclist who is following behind. Integrated fenders designed into the bike provide a clean, safe attachment, and match the bike frame. =Enclosed drum brakes= Enclosed drum brakes or a rear coaster brake are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with drum brakes is optimized for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, drum brakes provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less. Enclosed drum brakes require infrequent maintenance, compared to rim brakes or disc brakes, and are more durable than disc brakes, which are exposed. Drum brakes are best suited for slower, moderate use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load. Under such heavy braking, drum brakes are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of drum brake is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the drum brake from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended. Drum brakes are heavier than rim brakes. =Luggage carrier= Transporting a passenger on the back rack, and a child next to the handlebar. A Dutch convention is to carry a passenger on the back rack, the passenger balancing side-saddle. The sturdy rack supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing. A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to the rack, providing useful transport capability. There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps. The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted on the back of the rack. Danish bikes are usually equipped with a back rack with a spring- loaded clamp. =Tires and wheels= Tires are puncture-resistant for travelling without a pump and tools to fix a flat tire. Width is normally medium to wide (1.5-1.75 inches; 38‚Äì44 mm), providing a balance of speed with durability and cushioning. These are semi-slick road tires with shallow tread, such as Schwalbe Marathon tires. Such tires are faster and quieter than mountain-bike tires, and more durable and reliable than road-racing tires. Reflective bands on the sidewalls make the wheels visible as wheels, not just as small reflectors. This makes the bike more visible from side at night by cars without using reflective clothing and extra lights. Large 28\\", 700 B or 700 C wheels are typical, providing a smoother ride than 26\\" wheels. On traditional Dutch city bikes, extremely thick spokes add carrying strength. To discourage theft, the front and back wheels use axle bolts instead of quick- releases. European city bikes are used in bike-friendly areas for short distances with sturdy tires. These features are suited to riding without tools or quick-release wheels. =Platform pedals= The platform pedals allow use with normal shoes. =Saddle= 285x285px The saddle is typically moderately broad, softly cushioned, and is often suspended. A non quick-release seat prevents having to lock or remove the seat to prevent theft. These features allow an increase in comfort considering the erect position. Some saddles further have a longitudinal slot, to avoid perineal pressure. Besides avoiding perineal pressure, these slots avoid sit bone pain, and saddle sores. =Single, dual or adjustable kickstand= A kickstand is present, and is often dual-leg or a center-stand for stability while the bike is carrying children or a load. Alternately, an adjustable-length kickstand enables parking regardless of the slope and load. A kickstand allows a bicycle to stand in any flat or slope surface without the need of an external stand or support. =Other features= A bell is standard equipment for bikes in Europe, and is required by law in some European countries, such as Denmark, Poland and Germany. Additional features are available, such as front and rear bicycle reflectors, baskets,EN 14872 standard child seatsthey follow the EN 14344 and ISO 11243 standards and a windshield.

Their musical style blended elements of 1960s American psychedelia with experimental electronica, incorporating samples from various sources, and earned the band a cult following. Broadcast released three studio albums‚ÄîThe Noise Made by People (2000), Haha Sound (2003), and Tender Buttons (2005)‚Äîas well as several EPs and a collaboration album with the Focus Group titled Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age (2009). Their most recent release is the soundtrack album Berberian Sound Studio (2013). Aside from founding members Keenan and Cargill, Broadcast has experienced regular lineup changes. The band has included Roj Stevens (keyboards), Tim Felton (guitar), and Steve Perkins (drums). Keith York, Phil Jenkins, Jeremy Barnes and Neil Bullock have also featured in the band as drummers. As of 2005, Broadcast consisted only of the founding duo. Following the death of Keenan in 2011, Cargill remained the only member. History =1995‚Äì1999: Formation= Keenan (formerly of folk duo Hayward Winters) and Cargill met in the mid 1990s at the Sensateria psychedelic club, and formed Pan Am Flight Bag in 1995, renamed Broadcast after several concerts. The band's first release in 1996, was the 7\\" single \\"Accidentals\\" (issued on Wurlitzer Jukebox Records), which was written based around a sample from Joseph Losey‚Äôs 1967 film Accident. The same year, they released The Book Lovers EP (issued in November by Duophonic Records). In 1996, the band recorded a Peel Session. Warp released a compilation album, Work and Non Work, in June 1997, compiling the EP and two singles. The 1999 Broadcast track \\"You Can Fall\\" was included on the soundtrack album for the film Morvern Callar, released by Warp in 2002. =2000‚Äì2010: Studio albums= The group's debut studio album, The Noise Made by People, was released by Warp in March 2000. It was self-produced in the group's own recording studio after having been through three producers to get a particular sound. Regarding the expensive two year production of the album, Keenan said, \\"There [were] no financial benefits in getting it right.\\" The band issued two EPs in the same year, Extended Play and Extended Play Two. Their second album, Haha Sound, was released in August 2003, preceded by two EPs, Microtronics Volume 01: Stereo Recorded Music for Links and Bridges and Pendulum. Recording sessions for the album took place in fragments at various locations: Keenan recorded vocal tracks with her head in a cardboard box which gave it a \\"closeness and deadness that makes it sit in the mix a bit nicer,\\" while drummer Bullock recorded drum tracks in a neighborhood church before overdubbing guitar tracks and additional arrangements. Haha Sound became their first charting album in the United States, reaching No. 8 in the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. While touring the United States to promote Haha Sound, the group recruited American drummer Jeremy Barnes to perform their live shows. Felton departed after Haha Sound to form a new project, Seeland, with Billy Bainbridge (formerly of another Birmingham Warp act, Plone). Broadcast's next album, Tender Buttons, was issued in September 2005. It was their first album as a duo of Keenan and Cargill. A second compilation of B-sides and rarities, The Future Crayon, was issued in August 2006. Broadcast released a collaborative album with the Focus Group (aka graphic designer and Ghost Box label co-owner Julian House) called Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age in October 2009. The band was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, Somerset, England. =2011‚Äì2013: Keenan's death and Berberian Sound Studio= Keenan died on 14 January 2011 at the age of 42, following complications with pneumonia, which she suffered from after earlier contracting H1N1. Cargill, the sole remaining member, said in a 2011 interview with Under the Radar that a new Broadcast album was in the works, featuring vocals recorded by Keenan shortly before her death. He later said: \\"Trish left a lot of tapes, four-tracks and stuff, and I‚Äôve been going through those. It‚Äôs difficult, and I‚Äôm connected to it at the same time. It‚Äôs wonderful, but I‚Äôm also feeling a sense of loss. The next thing I release with Trish on it will be more like a monument and a tribute to her rather than this obsessive thing I used to have about making albums.\\" however, the album has not been released. Broadcast were credited with providing the soundtrack Berberian Sound Studio for the 2012 film of the same name; the soundtrack was released 7 January 2013. Warp Records reissued the band's entire discography in March 2015. Other projects Cargill formed the project Children of Alice with House and former Broadcast member Stevens; they released their eponymous debut album in February 2017. The group's name is a tribute to Keenan, who had cited Alice in Wonderland as a main inspiration.http://www.factmag.com/2017/01/12/broadcasts- james-cargill-announces-debut-album-warp-children-alice/ Artistry =Musical style= FACT described Broadcast's music as blending \\"pop songcraft and experimentally-minded electronic music into a contemporary blend of psychedelia that resonated deeply with listeners\\". The band's musical style has been variously labeled psychedelic pop, dream pop, avant-pop, and space age pop. A mixture of electronic sounds and Keenan's 1960s-inspired vocals, the band is heavily influenced by the 1960s American psychedelic group the United States of America, using many of the same electronic effects. The band were also known for using samples taken from both library music compilations and real-life field recordings. Their preoccupation with past cultural aesthetics saw them grouped with the 2000s electronic trend known as hauntology. Keenan performing with Broadcast in 2010Keenan said that the group \\"[listens] to a lot of soundtracks\\", and in a 2007 interview, she stated that the group aspired with each album to \\"make a soundtrack for a film that doesn't exist.\\" In their early years, the band was frequently compared to acts such as Portishead and Stereolab. The group's musical output, according to journalist Mikey Jones, \\"fused the worlds of pop songcraft and experimentally- minded electronic music into a contemporary blend of psychedelia that resonated deeply with listeners, effectively expanding the conventions of what could be considered psychedelic.\\" Other recurrent elements in the band's music (particularly their first two albums) were \\"science fiction\\" atmospheres and \\"skewed variants\\" of swing and jazz music, which \\"offered a Eurocentric counterpoint to the mostly American psych innovators they‚Äôd imbibed.\\" In a review published in Spin in 2001, the band were likened to being \\"stuck in a time warp‚Äìthe sound of '70s wife-swapping parties with beanbags and unhappy children serving sausages on sticks.\\" =Equipment= The band's recording gear and methods were profiled in a 2003 article in Electronic Musician, in which it was noted that they recorded many of their guitar arrangements (played at that time on a 1960s Italian Eko Edsel) through microphones, rather than through a DI unit. Additional instruments, including the vibraphone, timpani, clarinets and organ were recorded and subsequently fed through a speaker again in order to be re-recorded with microphones. Their private studio setup included an AKG BX-15, a Fostex rackmount coil reverb amplifier and an Acutronics tray (originally sourced from a Fender amplifier.) Their recording setup also included a MOTU 2408 hard-disk recording system, an Apple Mac G4, a Fender Rhodes, a Vox Continental and a Korg MS-20. For digital production, the band sometimes used an reFX QuadraSid emulator and Native Instruments Reaktor. Commenting on the production of their third album, Haha Sound, Keenan said: \\"You know when it feels overworked. We used more of a minimalist approach on this album: There has been less emphasis on decoration and more on repetitive parts that go through the tracks. They are not the focus for your ear, but they are the foundation.\\" =Live performances= Keenan suffered from stage fright in Broadcast's early days, and earned a reputation for a \\"shoegazing onstage introversion.\\" \\"I used to get nervous like the whole of that day of the show, and now it only happens the moment I walk onstage,\\" she later said in a 1998 interview. \\"When you listen to me sing my first line, you can always tell my heart is in my throat. Headlining gigs is a confidence booster.\\" Discography *The Noise Made by People (2000) *Haha Sound (2003) *Tender Buttons (2005) *Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age (2009) *Berberian Sound Studio (2013) Members * James Cargill - bass, production * Trish Keenan - vocals, guitar, keyboards * Roj Stevens - keyboards * Tim Felton - guitar * Steve Perkins - drums *Keith York - drums *Phil Jenkins - drums *Jeremy Barnes - drums *Neil Bullock - drums References External links *Broadcast at the BBC *Concert photos by Laurent Orseau (Black Session) *Interview with James Cargill from Cyclic Defrost magazine (Australia, 2005) *Promotional page for collaborative release 'Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age' on Warp website *Memories of an interview with Broadcast Category:Dream pop musical groups Category:English electronic music groups Category:English pop music groups Category:Warp (record label) artists Category:Tommy Boy Records artists Category:Drag City (record label) artists Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in England Category:Musical groups from Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Broadcast (band)"},{"id":"856569","text":"Hollywood Hotel in 1905, after expansion. The Hollywood Hotel was a famous hotel, society venue of early Hollywood, and landmark, formerly located at 6811 Hollywood Boulevard, on the north side, extending from Highland Avenue to Orchid Avenue, in central Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. History =Early years= Original 1902 Hollywood Hotel. The Hollywood Hotel opened in December 1902. It was built by early Hollywood developer H.J. Whitley, to support selling residential lots to potential buyers arriving from Los Angeles by the electric Balloon Route trolly of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. Google Books: Historic Hotels of Los Angeles and Hollywood, by Linda McCann, Dace Taube, Claude Zachary, Curtis C. Roseman] It was developed on property owned by Harrison Gray Otis, George Hoover, and Whitley. Located on the west side of Highland Avenue, the elegant wood structure with Mission Revival style stucco facades and broad verandas also fronted on unpaved Prospect Avenue, lined with California pepper trees. The hotel was sited among lemon groves then at the base of the Hollywood Hills, part of the Santa Monica Mountains in the area. Whitley was instrumental in improvements to Prospect Avenue, which in 1910 was renamed Hollywood Boulevard. Increasing business compelled the building of an additional 40-room wing onto the hotel in 1905. Whitley surrounded the hotel with of cultivated gardens. He operated the establishment as a country resort hotel as the developing community of Hollywood first established itself.Los Angeles Herald (August 31, 1951)California Historian Volume 54, Number 4 published by Conference of California Historical Societies (2008)Los Angeles Times Magazine (January 4, 1987)\\"California and Californians,\\" by Rockwell Dennis Hunt and Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez (1930)[Jonathan Magazine http://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/Jonathans.pdf Jonathan Magazine: \\"The Great Developer\\"] (March 2009)] In 1906 the heiress Almira Hershey, who was then living in a mansion on Bunker Hill in Downtown Los Angeles, took a horse and buggy ride to see the hotel that was being advertised in the Los Angeles Times. She was so impressed with the Hollywood Hotel she decided to buy it. She hired Margaret J. Anderson who had worked for her at the Darby and the Fremont Hotels, which Hershey owned, as the manager. Under Anderson's management, the hotel expanded from 16 rooms to 250 and became well known in the area, but the two women had a contentious relationship and Anderson left to move to the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1912. =Motion picture era= The fame of the Hollywood Hotel, like that of Hollywood, came from its identification with the Hollywood movie industry, beginning in the 1910s. Legends of the early industry first stayed at the hotel, such as Jesse Lasky, Carl Laemmle, Louis B. Mayer, Harry Warner, and Irving Thalberg. Producers, directors, writers and technicians held conferences on the broad verandas. There was a 'stream' of silent film movie stars and movie moguls passing through. Some of the movie industry people resided in the hotel, and many attended the dances held Thursday nights in the ballroom. It was considered \\"the\\" place to be seen and the cultural center of Hollywood. To identify where certain people regularly sat to dine, the hotel had stars with the names of celebrities painted on the ceiling above their tables. Among the scores of movie stars who stayed at the Hollywood Hotel through the years was Rudolph Valentino, who lived in room 264. He met his first wife, Jean Acker, in the hotel, where they were married in 1919 and spent their honeymoon. Other stars included Ethel Barrymore, Norma Shearer, and Valentino's second wife Natasha Rambova. The hotel also hosted notable guests from beyond Los Angeles and the United States. Songwriter Carrie Jacobs Bond composed her famous song A Perfect Day, and sang it, while a guest at the Hollywood Hotel. In 1922 Almira Hershey lost a breach of contract dispute with the hotel's long time manager George Krom, which allowed him to purchase the hotel. =Decline and demolition= In the early 1940s, Charles E. Toberman, a real estate developer who was known as \\"Mr. Hollywood,\\" acquired all the stock of the Good Hope Company, which owned the Hollywood Hotel property. He wanted to tear it down then and redevelop the block, but was halted because of the restrictions on building materials during World War II. By the 1950s, the hotel was run down and faded from its former glory. Developers were adamant that renovating and restoring the property was out of the question. Though the Hollywood Hotel was an architectural landmark and had housed many of the great Hollywood stars in its day, it was razed in August 1956 to make way for a development. It was replaced by a twelve story office building for the First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Hollywood, a shopping center, and parking lots. In 2001 those were demolished, and the Hollywood and Highland Center shopping and entertainment complex was built on the site. It includes the Dolby Theatre (formerly known as the Kodak Theatre), the current home of the annual Academy Awards ceremony. A new Hollywood Hotel opened at 1160 Vermont Avenue in 1964.https://www.thehollywoodhotel.com/our-hotel See also References External links Category:Hotels in Los Angeles Category:Hollywood Boulevard Category:Hollywood history and culture Category:Demolished hotels in the United States Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Los Angeles Category:Destroyed landmarks in California Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1902 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1956 Category:1902 establishments in California Category:1956 disestablishments in California Category:Mission Revival architecture in California ","title":"Hollywood Hotel"},{"id":"856573","text":"A rompler is an electronic music instrument that plays pre-fabricated sounds based on audio samples. In contrast to samplers, romplers do not record audio and have limited or no capability for generating original sounds. The term rompler is a portmanteau of the terms ROM and sampler. Both may have additional sound editing features, such as layering several waveforms and modulation with ADSR envelopes, filters and LFOs. The waveforms are commonly stored in form of PCM-encoded waveforms which were similar to those stored in WAV or AIFF file formats, although in some hardware design other encodings and forms of (usually lossless) compression could be used. The core characteristic of a rompler, compared to a sampler, is that they do not have the ability to record new samples, or in case of software instruments, the ability to add user samplers from disk. Note that earlier digital synthesizers, which used short-cycle sampled waveforms, are usually not considered romplers but are either called \\"PCM synthesizers\\" or \\"Wavetable synthesizers\\" because the sampled waveform in this case is usually only made of a single full cycle (or a handful of full cycles) of the wave and would therefore be a fraction of a second in length, whereas in case of a sampler or a rompler, the recording would usually contain the sample's decay and sometimes even release sections, such as with a recorded drum hit or piano note. Also, in their usage of sampled waves filters (usually digital) were employed to gradually alter the timbre of cycling wave which makes them somewhat similar to analog subtractive synthesizers. However in many such designs, the attack section of a sound was often sampled as a full, longer sample, and then crossfaded or mixed with the looping PCM waveform, such as with Roland's Linear Arithmetic synthesis and its competitors from other manufacturers, further blurring the difference. Hardware romplers emerged in the late 1980s, as price drops of memory chips allowed for longer recording storage to be used without making the instruments prohibitively expensive. They were meant to displace previous FM and PCM-based digital synthesizers in the market, by offering more realistic sound of real, acoustic and electronic instruments, and by the early 1990s they became the dominant technology for mainstream keyboards. The most successful early romplers are considered to be Korg M1 workstation, and E-mu Proteus module. Before the emergence of software virtual instruments, computer sound hardware gradually shifted from synthesizer based sound and music reproduction (such as with Commodore SID or Yamaha OPN chips) to PCM-based chips, such as Commodore Amiga's Paula. Combined with computer's RAM and disk storage, these chips allowed for longer PCM recordings to be reproduced, and games and other software often used rompler-like software technology to reproduce music, most notable example being music trackers on Amiga. Later computer sound hardware employed hardware rompler and sample-based synthesizers (such as Gravis Ultrasound and E-mu/Creative SoundBlaster) to increase number of voices and reduce CPU usage for sound processing. As the processing power of personal computers grew, these hardware synthesizers were gradually abandoned and sound hardware of contemporary computers now usually has only PCM reproduction converters with all synthesis and reproduction logic implemented in software. Modern computers are capable of real-time reproduction of large number of voices, as well as real-time emulation of analogue sound circuits. With the introduction of digital audio workstations, musicians started to employ more and more virtual instruments, so a market for software romplers, as a source of instantly available sampled instruments, also emerged. Some popular examples of software romplers are reFX Nexus and IK Multimedia Sampletank.

While a student at Barnard College, she became the roommate of Edie Parker (later married to Jack Kerouac). Their apartment became a gathering place for the Beats during the 1940s, where Vollmer was often at the center of marathon, all-night discussions. In 1946, she began a relationship with William S. Burroughs, later becoming his common-law wife. In 1951, Burroughs killed Vollmer in what he first admitted to and shortly thereafter denied as a drunken attempt at playing William Tell. Early life and education Joan Vollmer was born in Loudonville, an affluent suburb of Albany, New York, to an upper-middle-class family. She attended Barnard College in New York City in the early 1940s. Vollmer met Edie Parker at the West End Bar and the two moved in together in the first of a series of apartments in New York's Upper West Side that they shared with the writers, hustlers, alcoholics and drug addicts that later became known as the Beats. These included: William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Lucien Carr, Herbert Huncke, Vickie Russell (a prostitute and addict who appears as \\"Mary\\" in Burroughs' novel Junkie), and Hal Chase, a Columbia University graduate student from Denver. Vollmer married Paul Adams, a law student, in 1944, and had her first child, Julie, in August 1944. In 1945, Vollmer asked Adams, who was in the military at the time, to consent to divorce. Paul Adams divorced Vollmer upon returning from military service, reportedly appalled by her drug use and group of friends. In 1945 Jack Kerouac introduced her to Benzedrine, which she used heavily for a few years. Early in 1946, she began a long-term relationship with Burroughs. The match was initially set up and encouraged by Allen Ginsberg, who much admired Burroughs‚Äô intellect and considered Joan his female counterpart. Several years later, when Vollmer and Burroughs were living together in Texas, Ginsberg encouraged Burroughs to break up with Vollmer, believing that Burroughs could never return her total devotion. Nevertheless, Burroughs ignored this advice and evidence suggests he and Vollmer had a passionate affair. Once they were arrested for having sex in a parked vehicle. Vollmer became a mother for the second time after William, Jr. was born in 1947. In 1946, Vollmer had been admitted to Bellevue Hospital in New York City due to psychotic episodes as a result of excessive amphetamine use. At this time Burroughs had been convicted of prescription forgery and was sentenced to return to his parents' care in St. Louis, Missouri. Immediately after completing his probationary order, he traveled to New York to retrieve Vollmer from Bellevue. From that moment until her death, she called herself Mrs. William Burroughs. Although the two were never formally married, they had a son, William Burroughs, Jr. Due to trouble with the law for drug abuse, drug distribution and lewd behavior charges, they relocated several times, moving first to New Waverly, Texas, then to New Orleans, and eventually to Mexico City. While living in New Orleans, Burroughs was arrested for heroin possession, during which time police searched Vollmer's home, unearthing letters from Ginsberg discussing a possible shipment of marijuana. The resulting criminal charges were grave ‚Äî upon conviction Burroughs would have served two to five years in Louisiana's infamous Angola State Prison; he fled for Mexico City.Women of the Beat.org written by Maureen Latvala Once he was settled, Vollmer joined him, along with her children. Life in Mexico City (1949-1951) Vollmer was reportedly unhappy in Mexico City. Benzedrine, her usual drug of choice, was unavailable, and she wrote to Ginsberg that she was \\"somewhat drunk from 8:00am on... Bill is fine in himself, and so are we jointly. The boys are lovely, easy and cheap (3 pesos = 40 cents) but my patience is infinite.\\" Ted Morgan describes her in Literary Outlaw as a woman suffering from serious drug and alcohol addictions which had aged her noticeably. Her face was swollen; she limped due to a recent bout of polio.Morgan, Ted. Literary Outlaw; pp. 189. New York: Avon Books, 1988. In her son‚Äôs novel Kentucky Ham (1973), Vollmer is remembered as a gentle and considerate mother who was meek and deferential to her husband's parents. Yet she is also depicted as being prone to wild bouts of self- destructive behavior. The book recounts a reckless, almost deadly drive down a mountainside road in Mexico. Joan's battered appearance and unpredictable behavior alarmed Ginsberg when he visited with Lucien Carr in 1951. During their visit she expressed some bitterness and hostility toward Burroughs' lack of affection and continued drug addiction. In fact, at the time of Ginsberg's visit, Burroughs was away in Guatemala with a young man he pursued unsuccessfully. In a 1980s interview with Ted Morgan, Burroughs described a domestic violence incident which occurred shortly after his arrival in Mexico in January 1950, stating he \\"slapped\\" Joan after she threw his heroin in the toilet and recalled how he immediately went out to buy more, stating \\"What could she do? [Go back to Upstate] New York?\\"Grauerholz, James W. The Death of Joan Vollmer Burroughs: What Really Happened? The same scene was recounted in Burroughs' semi-autobiographical Junkie: \\"When my wife saw I was getting the habit again, she did something she had never done... My wife grabbed the spoon and threw the junk on the floor. I slapped her twice across the face and she threw herself on the bed, sobbing.\\" Herbert Huncke, who had stayed with the couple in Texas, was struck by Burroughs' indifference to Joan, stating that Burroughs \\"didn't like to be annoyed with her too much.\\" In August 1950, a petition for divorce was initiated in Mexico by Burroughs, Vollmer, or both. Although their marriage was a common-law marriage, in Mexico it was considered legal. However, the application was later withdrawn by their Mexican attorney. The divorce was likely required due to Burroughs' stated desire to take custody of their son upon dissolution.Grauerholz, James. The Death of Joan Vollmer Burroughs: What Really Happened? January 7, 2002. American Studies Department, University of Kansas. From the same source, there is some speculation that Vollmer was romantically linked with several men while living in Mexico.  Death  On September 6th, 1951, Burroughs shot Vollmer in the head, allegedly while trying to shoot a glass he had asked her to balance on her head during a drunken William Tell act. Vollmer died several hours after being shot in the head, at the age of 28. Burroughs said he had eight to ten drinks and couldn't remember much of that night, while witnesses Woods and Marker claimed they had two small glasses. The couple's four-year-old son, William Burroughs Jr. was in the room when the accident occurred. Burroughs gave different accounts of the shooting, denying his original William Tell story after intervention by his prominent Mexican attorney, Bernab√© Jurado. In December 2017, it came to light that Lewis Marker and Eddie Woods (not the poet Eddie Woods, who was also friends with Burroughs) were present at the shooting. Burroughs' brother Mortimer arrived from St. Louis to help his brother, providing thousands of dollars for legal costs to Jurado, who used part of the money to bribe the judge, ballistics experts, and others involved in the case. Burroughs was held on murder charges for thirteen days before being released on bail. Burroughs claimed that he dropped the gun and it misfired, then changed the account again to say that he accidentally misfired the gun while trying to sell the weapon to an acquaintance, an account which was corroborated by two witnesses who had been coached by Jurado. Burroughs testified that he had not known that the gun was loaded because he had not used it in three months, and that while he had been checking the gun, the carriage had slipped and it had misfired at Vollmer. As a result, he was charged with criminal negligence, which carried a maximum sentence of five years. For a year, Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while Jurado worked to resolve the case. However, Jurado fled to Brazil after shooting a youth who had accidentally damaged his Cadillac. Burroughs decided to follow Jurado's example and fled back to the United States, where he was fortunate that Louisiana had not issued a warrant for his arrest on the previous narcotic charge. In absentia, Burroughs was convicted of manslaughter in Vollmer's death. He received a two-year suspended sentence. Vollmer was buried in Mexico City and her parents took her two children back to the United States. Her daughter Julie went to live with her maternal grandparents in Loudonville and assumed the surname Vollmer, while Vollmer's son was raised by her in-laws.  Reactions to Vollmer's death  Friends of the couple were divided in opinion on the case. Ginsberg and Carr defended Burroughs and believed that Vollmer may have encouraged the William Tell incident, stating she had seemed suicidal when they visited her in 1951. Haldon Chase, who had also visited Burroughs and Vollmer in 1951 in Mexico City, distanced himself from Burroughs after Vollmer's death. Chase believed that Vollmer \\"had wanted to die,\\" but that Burroughs story was \\"a sham, a put- up thing to release Bill, to let him commit the ultimate crime.\\" In interviews with Ted Morgan from 1983-1986, Burroughs said \\"Allen was always making it out as a suicide on her part, and I do not accept that cop-out.\\" By the 1980s, Burroughs had publicly returned to the William Tell story to explain the killing of Joan. In a 1954 letter to Ginsberg, Burroughs wrote about his fears that he had subconsciously wanted to kill Joan: \\"May yet attempt a story or some account of Joan's death. I think I am afraid. Not exactly to discover unconscious intent, it's more complex, more basic, and more horrible, as if the brain drew the bullet toward it.\\" In the introduction to Queer, Burroughs describes how Joan's death exposed him to the risk of possession by a malevolent entity he called \\"the Ugly Spirit\\", forcing him to become a writer as a consequence: > I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would have never become a > writer but for Joan‚Äôs death ... I live with the constant threat of > possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from Control. So > the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, > and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice > except to write my way out.Queer, Penguin, 1985, p. xxiii. Burroughs meant this reference to \\"possession\\" to be taken literally, stating: \\"My concept of possession is closer to the medieval model than to modern psychological explanations... I mean a definite possessing entity.\\"Queer, Penguin, 1985, p. xxiii. Burroughs' writing was intended as a form of \\"sorcery\\", in his own wordsStevens, Matthew Levi. The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs. p.125. \\\\- to disrupt language via methods such as the cut-up technique, and thus protect himself from possession.\\"When Gysin, apparently in trance, told Burroughs 'The Ugly Spirit shot Joan because' he thought he finally had the answer... the unforgiveable slip that had caused the death of his common-law wife, Joan Vollmer... had come about because he was literally possessed by an evil spirit ... William instinctively knew the only solution available to him... If the Word was indeed the basic mechanism of control - the 'virus' by which The Ugly Spirit, or its agency Control, exerted its malevolent influence - then surely a real understanding of the Word, what words are and what can be done with them - was essential. All these explorations and obsessions were not merely diversions, experiments for artistic or literary amusement... but part of a deadly struggle with unseen, invisible - perhaps evil - psycho-spiritual enemies.\\" ‚Äì Stevens, Matthew Levi.

Journey through space-time, published in The Job (1970). John Calder Ltd.\\"Burroughs often wrote about his belief in a 'magical universe.' ... Curses are real, possession is real. This struck him as a better model for human experience and psychology than the neurosis theories of Freud, in the end... he did pursue a lifelong quest for spiritual techniques by which to master his unruly thoughts and feelings, to gain a feeling of safety from oppression and assault from without, and from within.\\" ‚Äì James Grauerholz, On Burroughs and Dharma, Summer Writing Institute, 24th June 1999, Naropa University. Transcript published in Beat Scene Magazine, No.71a, Winter 2014. Later in life, Burroughs described the Ugly Spirit as \\"Monopolistic, acquisitive evil. Ugly evil.

Film The film Beat (2000) is a biographical account of the relationship between Joan Vollmer Burroughs and William S. Burroughs. Joan Vollmer Burroughs is portrayed by Courtney Love and William S. Burroughs by Kiefer Sutherland. There are brief appearances by Daniel Martinez as Jack Kerouac, Ron Livingston as Allen Ginsberg and Norman Reedus as Lucien Carr. The film centres on the killing of Joan Vollmer Burroughs, on 6 September 1951, by her husband, William S. Burroughs. It also portrays Lucien Carr's plea of guilty to the first-degree manslaughter, on 13 August 1944, of David Kammerer, played by Kyle Secor, for which he served two years of a one-to-twenty-year sentence in the Elmira Correctional Facility in Upstate New York.

The title Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach () refers to either of two manuscript notebooks that the German Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach presented to his second wife, Anna Magdalena. Keyboard music (minuets, rondeaux, polonaises, chorales, sonatas, preludes, musettes, marches, gavottes) makes up most of both notebooks, and a few pieces for voice (songs, and arias) are included. The Notebooks provide a glimpse into the domestic music of the 18th century and the musical tastes of the Bach family. History The two notebooks are known by their title page dates of 1722 and 1725. The title \\"Anna Magdalena notebook\\" is commonly used to refer to the latter. The primary difference between the two collections is that the 1722 notebook contains works only by Johann Sebastian Bach (including most of the French Suites), while the 1725 notebook is a compilation of music by both Bach and other composers of the era.1\\\\.

Bach P 225 at Bach Digital website =The 1722 notebook: French Suites and miscellany= Title page of the first (1722) Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. Note the titles of the three Pfeiffer books written by Bach in the lower right corner. This notebook contains 25 unbound sheets (including two blank pages), which is estimated to be approximately a third of the original size. It is not known what happened to the other pages. The back and the corners are decorated with brown leather; greenish paper is used for the cover. The title page is inscribed ' in Anna Magdalena's hand. For a reason so far unknown to researchers, Johann Sebastian wrote the titles of three books by theologian August Pfeiffer (died 1698) in the lower right corner of the title page: * ' is a shortened and misspelled title of ' (Anti- Calvinism, or Conversations about the reformed religion). * \\"' item\\" refers to Pfeiffer's ' (\\"Evangelical Christian School\\"). * AntiMelancholicus refers to ' (Anti-melancholy, or [something or someone] to drive out the melancholy]). The notebook contains the following works, most in Johann Sebastian's hand: * Five keyboard suites. The first three are fragments of the pieces that are now known as the first three French Suites, BWV 812‚Äì814. The next two are complete suites, French Suites Nos. 4 and 5, BWV 815‚Äì816. The minuets of suites 2 and 3 are separated from the rest of their respective suites and were most probably added at a later date by Anna Magdalena Bach (they are almost certainly in her hand), some time before 1725. * Fantasia pro organo, unfinished, BWV 573. A short organ piece, 12 complete bars and the beginning notes of the 13th bar. * Air with variations in C minor, unfinished, BWV 991. The first 10 bars feature coherent two-part writing, but the remaining 35 bars only have one voice written out. * \\"Jesus, meine Zuversicht\\", chorale prelude, BWV 728. A brief (9 bars) piece in three voices, features two sections with repeats for each. * Minuet in G major, BWV 841 (not to be confused with Petzold's Minuet in G Major in the 1725 notebook). A short dance with simplistic two-part writing and two sections with repeats for each. =The 1725 notebook= Cover of the second (1725) Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach The 1725 notebook is larger than the 1722 one, and more richly decorated. Light green paper is used for the front cover, Anna Magdalena's initials and the year number \\"1725\\" are printed in gold. All pages feature gilt edging. Most of the entries in the 1725 notebook were made by Anna Magdalena herself, with others written in the hand of Johann Sebastian, some by sons Johann Christian and Carl Philipp Emanuel, and a few by family friends such as Johann Gottfried Bernhard and Johann Gottfried Heinrich. Although the 1725 notebook does contain work composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, it also includes works by many other composers. The authorship of several pieces is identified in the notebook itself, while that of others was established by researchers. The composers of still others, including several popular songs of the time, remain unknown. Here is a complete list of the pieces included, in order of appearance in the notebook: #Keyboard partita in A minor, BWV 827.

He later became active in the Conservative Party and was elected as a Member of the European Parliament. He served as an MEP from 1979 to 1999, serving as President of the European Parliament from 1987 to 1989, the only Briton to hold the post. Background Henry Plumb's family were from Cheshire and had been in farming for several generations. His father farmed at Coleshill in Warwickshire, on which his son joined him in 1940. He took over running the farm in 1952 when his father died. The farm ran to and consisted primarily of a dairy herd (200 pedigree Ayrshire cattle) with 70 breeding sows and of grain.Leonard Amey, \\"A fighter to lead the farmers\\", The Times, 30 January 1970, p. 10. National Farmers Union After rising through the county branch, in 1965 Plumb was elected Vice-President of the National Farmers Union. Although only 40 years old he was considered for the Presidency,\\"Probables And Possibles For N.F.U. Presidency\\", The Times, 29 December 1965, p. 4. but had to settle for promotion to Deputy President in 1966.\\"N.F.U. Choose New President\\", The Times, 9 April 1966, p. 6. In the late 1960s Plumb was a member of the Northumberland Committee inquiring into the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, being the only working farmer on the committee. Towards the end of the committee's deliberations, a report from political correspondent J.W. Murray in Farmer and Stockbreeder claimed that Plumb had single-handedly persuaded the committee to recommend prohibiting the import of carcass meat from countries where foot-and-mouth was endemic.\\"MP's motion on alleged farm report leak\\", The Times, 8 February 1969, p. 3. President of the NFU In January 1970 the incumbent President of the NFU Gwilym Williams failed to get the 80% support necessary to be re-elected, and Plumb was elected President of the NFU in his place.Leonard Amey, \\"President of NFU is ousted\\", The Times, 30 January 1970, p. 2. Plumb's term of office included British accession to the European Economic Community and its Common Agricultural Policy and Plumb negotiated for greater support for British agriculture; he stressed that Britain no longer had the economic power to bring cheap food prices.Leonard Amey, \\"Britain can no longer attract cheap food, NFU chief says\\", The Times, 23 January 1973, p. 11. Plumb was, however, a strong supporter of British membership of the European Economic Community; he was considered as a possible director for the pro-market campaign in the 1975 referendum campaignDavid Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, \\"The 1975 Referendum\\", Macmillan, 1975, p. 73. and was described as one of its most indefatigable spokesmen.Butler & Kitzinger p. 171. Plumb was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 1973.\\"Birthday Honours\\", The Times, 2 June 1973, p. 4. European Parliament Having joined the Conservative Party, Plumb was elected Member of the European Parliament for the Cotswolds seat in 1979 and remained in the European Parliament until 1999, being President of the European Parliament 1987‚Äì1989. He was made a Life peer as Baron Plumb, of Coleshill in the County of Warwickshire on 6 April 1987. On 11 October 1988, Plumb received international attention. During the papal visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Pope John Paul II was delivering a speech. The infamous Ian Paisley heckled throughout the delivery, brandishing posters accusing the Pope of being the Antichrist. Using his position as president, Plumb ordered Paisley to leave the chamber. He retired from the House of Lords on 3 November 2017. He was also Chancellor of Coventry University between 1995 and 2007 and a founder of leading EU lobbying law firm Alber & Geiger. 2012 allegations of conflict of interest In June 2012 the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Independent newspaper revealed how senior members of the House of Lords failed to disclose their business interests in a public inquiry. As of July 2012, Plumb's entry in the register of interests listed his only remunerated employment/profession as 'farming', despite his involvement with the Brussels- based lobbying firm Alber and Geiger since 2007. According to The Independent, Plumb insisted \\"he did not need to register his involvement because he had never been in employment, paid or unpaid by the firm\\".

A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from the last human species. Stapledon's conception of history follows a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a consciousness composed of many telepathically linked individuals. In 1932, Stapledon followed Last and First Men with the far less acclaimed Last Men in London. Another Stapledon novel, Star Maker (1937), could also be considered a sequel to Last and First Men (mentioning briefly man's evolution on Neptune), but is even more ambitious in scope, being a history of the entire universe. It is the 11th title in the SF Masterworks series.  Human species  * First Men. (Chapters 1‚Äì6) The First Men is our own species. Beginning in the early twenty-first century, several increasingly devastating wars take place in Europe, which result in the United States and China becoming the two dominant superpowers on Earth. In the twenty-fourth century, the US and China go to war, and the war concludes with the formation of the First World State. Two centuries thereafter, all religions and secular science consolidate into a religion based on the worship of motion whose god is Gordelpus, the Prime Mover. Four millennia after the formation of the First World State, humans deplete Earth's supply of fossil fuels, resulting in the total collapse of civilization. 100,000 years later, the Patagonian Civilization emerges. One feature of the Patagonian civilization was a cult of youth. One day, a riot occurs at a mine, and the rioters inadvertently cause a colossal subterranean explosion, rendering most of the Earth's surface uninhabitable for millions of years save for the poles and the northern coast of Siberia. The only survivors of the disaster are thirty-five humans stationed at the North Pole, whose descendants eventually split up into two separate species, the Second Men and some sub-humans. The First Men do not become completely extinct until shortly after the emergence of the Second Men. * Second Men. (Chapters 7‚Äì 9) The Second Men came into existence ten million years after the fall of the First Men. \\"Their heads, indeed, were large even for their bodies, and their necks massive. Their hands were huge, but finely moulded...their legs were stouter...their feet had lost their separate toes...blonde hirsute appearance...Their eyes were large, and often jade green, their features firm as carved granite, yet mobile and lucent. ...not till they were fifty did they reach maturity. At about 190 their powers began to fail...\\" Unlike our species, egotism is virtually unknown to them. At the acme of their highly advanced civilization, just as they are about to create a superior human species by genetic engineering, a protracted war with the Martians finally ends with the Martians extinct and the Second Men gone into eclipse. *Third Men. (Chapter 10) \\"Scarcely more than half the stature of their predecessors, these beings were proportionally slight and lithe. Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous halo of red-gold hairs... golden eyes... faces were compact as a cat's muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and in races. ... But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six antennae of living steel.\\" Deeply interested in music (to the point of developing a religion based on the worship of music) and the design of living organisms. The Third Men eventually split into two factions: one that sought to create a subspecies of mediums, and one that focused on designing humans that consist almost entirely of brain tissue. *Fourth Men. (Chapter 11) Giant brains bred by one faction of the Third Men. For a long time they help govern their creators, but eventually their rule becomes oppressive and the Third Men rebel. The Fourth Men prevail by recruiting as servants a subspecies of Third Men prone to hypnotic suggestion (the ultimate product of the effort to breed a mediumistic subspecies). The docile subspecies of the Third Men exterminate the original subspecies, save for a few individuals to be used as lab specimens. After the war, the Fourth Men eventually reach the limits of their scientific abilities and discover that emotions and body are also necessary for complete understanding of the cosmos. *Fifth Men. (Chapters 11‚Äì12) An artificial human species designed by the Fourth Men. \\"On the average they were more than twice as tall as the First Men, and much taller than the Second Men... the delicate sixth finger had been induced to divide its tip into two Lilliputian fingers and a corresponding thumb. The contours of the limbs were sharply visible, for the body bore no hair, save for a close, thick skull-cap which, in the original stock, was of ruddy brown. The well-marked eyebrows, when drawn down, shaded the sensitive eyes from the sun.\\" After clashing with and finally eliminating the Third and Fourth Men, they develop a technology greater than Earth had ever known before. When Earth ceases to be habitable, they terraform Venus, committing genocide on its marine native race which tries to resist them. The Fifth Men do not cope well after the migration and eventually devolve and diverge into two species: the Sixth Men and a seal-like subhuman species. *Sixth Men. (Chapter 13) \\"Sadly reduced in stature and in brain, these abject beings... gained a precarious livelihood by grubbing roots upon the forest-clad islands, trapping the innumerable birds, and catching fish... Not infrequently they devoured, or were devoured by, their seal-like relatives.\\" After tectonic changes provide them with a promising land mass, they fluctuate like the First Men and repeat all their mistakes. *Seventh Men. Flying humans, \\"scarcely heavier than the largest of terrestrial flying birds\\", are created by the Sixth Men. After 100 million years, a flightless pedestrian subspecies appears which re-develops technology. *Eighth Men. \\"These long-headed and substantial folk were designed to be strictly pedestrian, physically and mentally.\\" When Venus becomes uninhabitable, about to be destroyed along with the entire inner solar system, they design the Ninth Men, who will live on Neptune. *Ninth Men. (Chapter 14) \\"Inevitably it was a dwarf type, limited in size by the necessity of resisting an excessive gravitation... too delicately organized to withstand the ferocity of natural forces on Neptune... civilization crumbled into savagery.\\" After the Ninth Men's civilization collapses, the Ninth Men themselves devolve into various animal species. *Tenth to Thirteenth Men. (Chapter 14) \\"Nowhere did the typical human form survive.\\" About three hundred million years after the colonization of Neptune, a rabbit-like species evolves into the Tenth Men. The Tenth Men are sentient but primitive. After a plague wipes out the Tenth Men, several other primitive human species rise and fall. *Fourteenth to Seventeenth Men. The Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Men are essentially Neptunian versions of the First, Second and Fifth Men, respectively. The Fourteenth Men create great civilisations and destroy them, frustrated with their own imperfections. The Fifteenth improve upon that, creating a spirituality based on \\"a devotion to the fulfilment of human capacity\\". They eventually create the Sixteenth Men - the first Neptunian artificial species. Thus the cycle of rise and collapse of civilisations ends, and steady progress takes its place. The Sixteenth Men achieve the highest level of civilisation possible \\"to the individual human brain acting in physical isolation\\" and to avoid stagnation create the Seventeenth Men, with an ability for \\"mental fusion of many individuals\\" to succeed them; however, the Seventeenth Men are \\"flawed\\" in some unspecified way, unimagined by the 16th due to their lesser awareness, and last only a short period of time before being replaced by the Eighteenth Men. *Eighteenth Men. (Chapters 15‚Äì16) The most advanced humans of all, essentially a perfected version of the 17th species. A race of philosophers and artists with a very liberal sexual morality. \\"Superficially we seem to be not one species but many.\\" (One interesting aspect of the Eighteenth Men is that they have a number of different \\"sub-genders,\\" variants on the basic male and female pattern, with distinctive temperaments. The Eighteenth Men's equivalent of the family unit includes one of each of these sub-genders and is the basis of their society. The units have the ability to act as a group mind, which eventually leads to the establishment of a single group mind uniting the entire species.). This species no longer died naturally, but only by accident, suicide or being killed. Despite their hyper- advanced civilisation, they practice ritual cannibalism.Chapter 15, subchapter 1: \\"[W]henever a human being has chosen to die, his body is ceremoniously eaten by his friends\\". They are eventually extinguished on Neptune after a supernova infects the sun, causing it to grow so hot that it consumes the remains of the solar system, faster than any means of escape they can devise. Unable to escape, this last species of man devises a virus to spread life to other worlds and cause the evolution of new sentient species throughout the galaxy. =Sub-humans= *Baboon-like Submen. (Chapter 7) \\"Bent so that as often as not they used their arms as aids to locomotion, flat-headed and curiously long-snouted, these creatures were by now more baboon-like than human\\". *Seal-like Submen. (Chapter 13) \\"The whole body was moulded to stream- lines. The lung capacity was greatly developed. The spine had elongated, and increased in flexibility. The legs were shrunken, grown together, and flattened into a horizontal rudder. The arms also were diminutive and fin- like, though they still retained the manipulative forefinger and thumb. The head had shrunk into the body and looked forward in the direction of swimming. Strong carnivorous teeth, emphatic gregariousness, and a new, almost human, cunning in the chase, combined to make these seal-men lords of the ocean\\". *Period of Eclipse. (Chapter 14) \\"Man's consciousness was narrowed and coarsened into brute-consciousness. By good luck the brute precariously survived.\\" Nature succeeds in colonising Neptune where sentient life fails. Human-derived mammals of all shapes come to dominate Neptune's ecosystem before adapting well enough for the vestiges of opposable thumbs and intelligence to become assets again.  Appearances in other media  Characters discuss the novel in H. G. Wells' Star-Begotten. The novel appears in the computer game Deus Ex as a reference when a corporation in the game allegedly tries to develop the Second Men in the series, but also in a much broader aspect as the game deals with genetic engineering, the next phase of evolution and human augmentations. Also similar to the book are the options presented to the player as to where human kind will go next: a fall back into an almost savage state of humanity, a keeping of the status quo or an extreme progression with the danger of sacrificing basic rights. Icelandic composer J√≥hann J√≥hannsson directed and scored a multimedia Last and First Men, \\"combining a film narrated by actress Tilda Swinton and accompanying score played by the BBC Philharmonic\\" at the 2017 Manchester International Festival. The 16mm black-and-white film is predominately of memorial sculptures erected in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. J√≥hannsson collaborated with Jos√© Enrique Maci√°n on writing the narration adapted from Stapledon's novel. This was next performed at the Barbican Centre, London in December 2018, and later at Sydney Opera House as part of the Vivid Festival, on 2 June 2019.  Influences on other writers  Brian Aldiss, in his preface to the 1962 edition, acknowledges the deep impression on him‚Äîand considerable influence on his own later writing‚Äìof Stapledon's book, which he encountered in 1943 while a British soldier fighting the Japanese in Burma ‚Äì \\"An appropriately unusual period of life at which to encounter a vision so far outside ordinary experience\\". Aldiss also mentions James Blish as another writer deeply influenced by Stapledon. C. S. Lewis in his own preface to That Hideous Strength, notes: \\"I believe that one of the central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations I had with a scientific colleague, some time before I met a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow\\". The reference to \\"objecting to Stapledon's philosophy\\" was no accident. In particular, the Christian Lewis objected to Stapledon's idea, as expressed in the present book, that mankind could escape from an outworn planet and establish itself on another one; this Lewis regarded as no less than a Satanic idea ‚Äì especially, but not only, because it involved genocide of the original inhabitants of the target planet. Professor Weston, the chief villain of Lewis's Space Trilogy, is an outspoken proponent of this idea, and in Out of the Silent Planet, Lewis opposes to it the depiction of the virtuous and stoic Martians/Malacandrians who choose to die with their dying planet, even though they possessed the technology to cross space and colonise Earth. Arthur C. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book Last and First Men that \\"No other book had a greater influence on my life ... [It] and its successor Star Maker (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career\\". H. P. Lovecraft held the book in very high regard (though he did not say whether it influenced any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz LeiberFrom a letter to Fritz Leiber on 18 November 1936. Published in Selected Letters V edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 357. \\"no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men ... Probably you have read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!\\", and in another 1936 letter to LeiberFrom a letter to Fritz Leiber on 19 December 1936. Published in Selected Letters V edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 375. \\"I'm glad to hear of your perusal of Last and First Men‚Äîa volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate \\"scientifiction\\". Its scope is dizzying‚Äîand despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity.\\" Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur WidnerFrom a letter to Arthur Widner on 20 February 1937. Published in Selected Letters V edited by August Derleth and James Turner, p. 415. he said \\"I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it‚Äîmerely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field‚Äîcertain of H. G. Wells's novels, S. Fowler Wright's The World Below, & that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, Last & First Men.\\" John Maynard Smith has said \\"A man called Olaf Stapledon was a marvellous predictor who wrote science fiction books that I read when I was 16 and that completely blew my mind; and Arthur C. Clarke put his finger on quite a number of bright thoughts. He and I have something in common: we both took out of the public library the same science fiction book when we were boys of about 15 or 16, which was Stapledon's Last and First Men. We took it out of the same country library in Porlock in Somerset. Whoever put that book on the shelves had a lot to answer for!\\"Adam Hart Davis (2004) talking science Wiley Sir Patrick Moore has said \\"The science fiction novel Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon is immensely thought-provoking and I've read it time and time again.\\"  See also  * 1930 in science fiction * Far future in fiction * Near future in fiction * Man After Man (1990) by Dougal Dixon ‚Äì a more recent book based on the same premise. *All Tomorrows (2008) by C.

Translators KUOW is also carried on the following satellite and broadcast translator stations to improve reception of the station: * KQOW 90.3 FM Bellingham * KUOW 1340 AM Tumwater/Olympia About KUOW KUOW's site states its mission as, \\"to create and serve an informed public, one challenged and invigorated by an understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures.\\" KUOW went on the air in 1952 on 90.5 FM. Its transmitter was on the University of Washington campus atop the Administration Building, now Gerberding Hall. In 1958, Dorothy Stimson Bullitt moved KING-FM to 98.1 and gifted KING's 94.9 FM transmitter and antenna to the Edison Vocational School. That same year, KUOW started using the 94.9 FM transmitter operated by Edison. KUOW is one of the few public radio (or any non-commercial educational) stations in the United States on a frequency outside of the reserved band (88‚Äì92 mhz; Seattle is also home to KING-FM on 98.1, which became a non-commercial station in 2010).FM Translators and Boosters fcc.gov July 6, 2017 For years, it served as a training ground for UW students to learn about broadcasting. Programming consisted of classical music, classroom lectures, local news, and Washington Huskies sports. From 1954 until 1987, KUOW was a sister station to educational television outlet (and now PBS member station) KCTS-TV (channel 9); the university spun off KCTS in 1987 and became a community licensee. In the 1960s, however, KUOW began branching out, adding more news programming. It was a charter member of NPR in 1970. In 1992, it changed format from music to news and information, and in 1999 it moved off campus to its current location on University Way. Also in 1999, UW outsourced the station's operation to Puget Sound Public Radio. In late March 2020, KUOW made \\"made an editorial decision to stop airing White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic live on a daily basis.\\" A statement from the station asserted that the decision was not politically based, and their \\"greater concern was the potential impact of false information on the health and safety of our community.\\" =HD Programming= KUOW-FM broadcasts in HD.

Reprinted from In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, ƒåech cohomology is a cohomology theory based on the intersection properties of open covers of a topological space. It is named for the mathematician Eduard ƒåech. Motivation Let X be a topological space, and let \\\\mathcal{U} be an open cover of X. Let N(\\\\mathcal{U}) denote the nerve of the covering. The idea of ƒåech cohomology is that, for an open cover \\\\mathcal{U} consisting of sufficiently small open sets, the resulting simplicial complex N(\\\\mathcal{U}) should be a good combinatorial model for the space X. For such a cover, the ƒåech cohomology of X is defined to be the simplicial cohomology of the nerve. This idea can be formalized by the notion of a good cover. However, a more general approach is to take the direct limit of the cohomology groups of the nerve over the system of all possible open covers of X, ordered by refinement. This is the approach adopted below. Construction Let X be a topological space, and let \\\\mathcal{F} be a presheaf of abelian groups on X. Let \\\\mathcal{U} be an open cover of X. =Simplex= A q-simplex œÉ of \\\\mathcal{U} is an ordered collection of q+1 sets chosen from \\\\mathcal{U}, such that the intersection of all these sets is non-empty. This intersection is called the support of œÉ and is denoted œÉ. Now let \\\\sigma = (U_i)_{i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0 , \\\\ldots , q \\\\\\\\}} be such a q-simplex. The j-th partial boundary of œÉ is defined to be the (q‚àí1)-simplex obtained by removing the j-th set from œÉ, that is: :\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma := (U_i)_{i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ 0 , \\\\ldots , q \\\\\\\\} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\}}. The boundary of œÉ is defined as the alternating sum of the partial boundaries: :\\\\partial \\\\sigma := \\\\sum_{j=0}^q (-1)^{j+1} \\\\partial_j \\\\sigma viewed as an element of the free abelian group spanned by the simplices of \\\\mathcal{U}. =Cochain= A q-cochain of \\\\mathcal{U} with coefficients in \\\\mathcal{F} is a map which associates with each q-simplex œÉ an element of \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\sigma) and we denote the set of all q-cochains of \\\\mathcal{U} with coefficients in \\\\mathcal{F} by C^q(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F). C^q(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F) is an abelian group by pointwise addition. =Differential= The cochain groups can be made into a cochain complex (C^{\\\\bullet}(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F), \\\\delta) by defining the coboundary operator \\\\delta_q : C^q(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F) \\\\to C^{q+1}(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) by: \\\\quad (\\\\delta_q f)(\\\\sigma) := \\\\sum_{j=0}^{q+1} (-1)^j \\\\mathrm{res}^{\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma} f (\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma), where \\\\mathrm{res}^{\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma} is the restriction morphism \\\\mathcal F(\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma) to \\\\mathcal F(\\\\sigma). A calculation shows that \\\\delta_{q+1} \\\\circ \\\\delta_q = 0. The coboundary operator is analogous to the exterior derivative of De Rham cohomology, so it sometimes called the differential of the cochain complex. Cocycle A q-cochain is called a q-cocycle if it is in the kernel of \\\\delta, hence Z^q(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) := \\\\ker ( \\\\delta_q) \\\\subseteq C^q(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F) is the set of all q-cocycles. Thus a (q‚àí1)-cochain f is a cocycle if for all q-simplices \\\\sigma the cocycle condition :\\\\sum_{j=0}^{q} (-1)^j \\\\mathrm{res}^{\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma}_{\\\\sigma} f (\\\\partial_j \\\\sigma) = 0 holds. A 0-cocycle f is a collection of local sections of \\\\mathcal{F} satisfying a compatibility relation on every intersecting A,B\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} :f(A)_{A \\\\cap B} = f(B)_{A \\\\cap B} A 1-cocycle f satisfies for every non-empty U = A\\\\cap B \\\\cap C with A,B,C \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} :f(B \\\\cap C)_U - f(A \\\\cap C)_U + f(A \\\\cap B)_U = 0 Coboundary A q-cochain is called a q-coboundary if it is in the image of \\\\delta and B^q(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) := \\\\mathrm{Im} ( \\\\delta_{q-1}) \\\\subseteq C^{q}(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) is the set of all q-coboundaries. For example, a 1-cochain f is a 1-coboundary if there exists a 0-cochain h such that for every intersecting A,B\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} :f(A \\\\cap B) = h(A)_{A \\\\cap B} - h(B)_{A \\\\cap B} =Cohomology= The ƒåech cohomology of \\\\mathcal{U} with values in \\\\mathcal{F} is defined to be the cohomology of the cochain complex (C^{\\\\bullet}(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}), \\\\delta). Thus the qth ƒåech cohomology is given by :\\\\check{H}^q(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) := H^q((C^{\\\\bullet}(\\\\mathcal U, \\\\mathcal F), \\\\delta)) = Z^q(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}) / B^q(\\\\mathcal{U}, \\\\mathcal{F}). The ƒåech cohomology of X is defined by considering refinements of open covers. If \\\\mathcal{V} is a refinement of \\\\mathcal{U} then there is a map in cohomology \\\\check{H}^*(\\\\mathcal U,\\\\mathcal F) \\\\to \\\\check{H}^*(\\\\mathcal V,\\\\mathcal F). The open covers of X form a directed set under refinement, so the above map leads to a direct system of abelian groups. The ƒåech cohomology of X with values in \\\\mathcal{F} is defined as the direct limit \\\\check{H}(X,\\\\mathcal F) := \\\\varinjlim_{\\\\mathcal U} \\\\check{H}(\\\\mathcal U,\\\\mathcal F) of this system. The ƒåech cohomology of X with coefficients in a fixed abelian group A, denoted \\\\check{H}(X;A), is defined as \\\\check{H}(X,\\\\mathcal{F}_A) where \\\\mathcal{F}_A is the constant sheaf on X determined by A. A variant of ƒåech cohomology, called numerable ƒåech cohomology, is defined as above, except that all open covers considered are required to be numerable: that is, there is a partition of unity {œÅi} such that each support \\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid\\\\rho_i(x)>0\\\\\\\\} is contained in some element of the cover. If X is paracompact and Hausdorff, then numerable ƒåech cohomology agrees with the usual ƒåech cohomology. Relation to other cohomology theories If X is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex, then the ƒåech cohomology \\\\check{H}^{*}(X;A) is naturally isomorphic to the singular cohomology H^*(X;A) \\\\,. If X is a differentiable manifold, then \\\\check{H}^*(X;\\\\R) is also naturally isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology; the article on de Rham cohomology provides a brief review of this isomorphism. For less well-behaved spaces, ƒåech cohomology differs from singular cohomology. For example if X is the closed topologist's sine curve, then \\\\check{H}^1(X;\\\\Z)=\\\\Z, whereas H^1(X;\\\\Z)=0. If X is a differentiable manifold and the cover \\\\mathcal{U} of X is a \\"good cover\\" (i.e. all the sets UŒ± are contractible to a point, and all finite intersections of sets in \\\\mathcal{U} are either empty or contractible to a point), then \\\\check{H}^{*}(\\\\mathcal U;\\\\R) is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology. If X is compact Hausdorff, then ƒåech cohomology (with coefficients in a discrete group) is isomorphic to Alexander-Spanier cohomology. In algebraic geometry ƒåech cohomology can be defined more generally for objects in a site C endowed with a topology. This applies, for example, to the Zariski site or the etale site of a scheme X. The ƒåech cohomology with values in some sheaf F is defined as :\\\\check H^n (X, F) := \\\\varinjlim_{\\\\mathcal U} \\\\check H^n(\\\\mathcal U, F). where the colimit runs over all coverings (with respect to the chosen topology) of X. Here \\\\check H^n(\\\\mathcal U, F) is defined as above, except that the r-fold intersections of open subsets inside the ambient topological space are replaced by the r-fold fiber product :\\\\mathcal U^{\\\\times^r_X} := \\\\mathcal U \\\\times_X \\\\dots \\\\times_X \\\\mathcal U. As in the classical situation of topological spaces, there is always a map :\\\\check H^n(X, F) \\\\rightarrow H^n(X, F) from ƒåech cohomology to sheaf cohomology. It is always an isomorphism in degrees n = 0 and 1, but may fail to be so in general. For the Zariski topology on a Noetherian separated scheme, ƒåech and sheaf cohomology agree for any quasi- coherent sheaf. For the √©tale topology, the two cohomologies agree for any √©tale sheaf on X, provided that any finite set of points of X are contained in some open affine subscheme. This is satisfied, for example, if X is quasi- projective over an affine scheme., Section III.2, Theorem 2.17 The possible difference between Cech cohomology and sheaf cohomology is a motivation for the use of hypercoverings: these are more general objects than the Cech nerve :N_X \\\\mathcal U : \\\\dots \\\\to \\\\mathcal U \\\\times_X \\\\mathcal U \\\\times_X \\\\mathcal U \\\\to \\\\mathcal U \\\\times_X \\\\mathcal U \\\\to \\\\mathcal U. A hypercovering K‚àó of X is a simplicial object in C, i.e., a collection of objects Kn together with boundary and degeneracy maps. Applying a sheaf F to K‚àó yields a simplicial abelian group F(K‚àó) whose n-th cohomology group is denoted Hn(F(K‚àó)).

Effervescence is the escape of gas from an aqueous solution and the foaming or fizzing that results from that release. The word effervescence is derived from the Latin verb fervere (to boil), preceded by the adverb ex. It has the same linguistic root as the word fermentation. Effervescence can also be observed when opening a bottle of champagne, beer or carbonated beverages such as soft drinks. The visible bubbles are produced by the escape from solution of the dissolved gas (which itself is not visible while dissolved in the liquid). Although CO2 is most common for beverages, nitrogen gas is sometimes deliberately added to certain beers. The smaller bubble size creates a smoother beer head. Due to the poor solubility of nitrogen in beer, kegs or widgets are used for this. In the laboratory, a common example of effervescence is seen if hydrochloric acid is added to a block of limestone. If a few pieces of marble or an antacid tablet are put in hydrochloric acid in a test tube fitted with a bung, effervescence of carbon dioxide can be witnessed. :CaCO3 + 2 HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 (^) This process is generally represented by the following reaction, where a pressurized dilute solution of carbonic acid in water releases gaseous carbon dioxide at decompression: :H2CO3 -> H2O + CO2 (^) In simple terms, it is the result of the chemical reaction occurring in the liquid which produces a gaseous product.G.

Model 1 SPD (Systems Programatic Double-case) equipped for edge-punched cards; most Flexowriters had paper-tape readers and punches The Friden Flexowriter was a teleprinter, a heavy-duty electric typewriter capable of being driven not only by a human typing, but also automatically by several methods, including direct attachment to a computer and by use of paper tape. Elements of the design date to the 1920s, and variants of the machine were produced until the early 1970s; the machines found a variety of uses during the evolution of office equipment in the 20th century, including being among the first electric typewriters, computer input and output devices, forerunners of modern word processing, and also having roles in the machine tool and printing industries. History =Origins and early history= The Flexowriter can trace its roots to some of the earliest electric typewriters. In 1925, the Remington Typewriter Company wanted to expand their offerings to include electric typewriters. Having little expertise or manufacturing ability with electrical appliances, they partnered with Northeast Electric Company of Rochester and made a production run of 2500 electric typewriters. When the time came to make more units, Remington was suffering a management vacuum and could not complete contract negotiations, so Northeast began work on their own electric typewriter. In 1929, they started selling the Electromatic. In 1931, Northeast was bought by Delco. Delco had no interest in a typewriter product line, so they spun the product off as a separate company called Electromatic. Around this time, Electromatic built a prototype automatic typewriter. This device used a wide roll of paper, similar to a player piano roll. For each key on the typewriter, there was a column on the roll of paper. If the key was to be pressed, then a hole was punched in the column for that key. The Electromatic typewriter patents document the use of pivoted spiral cams operating against a hard rubber drive roller to drive the print mechanism.Russell G. Thompson, Power Mechanism, , granted Sept. 30, 1930. This was the foundation of essentially all later electric typewriters. The typewriter could be equipped with a \\"remote control\\" mechanism allowing one typewriter to control another or to record and play back typed data through a parallel data connection with one wire per typewriter key.Russell G. Thompson, Apparatus for remote control, , granted March 26, 1935. The Electromatic tape perforator used a wide tape, with punch position per key on the keyboard.Chester W. Cumrine, Perforating Machine, , granted Sept. 11, 1930. In 1932, a code for the paper tape used to drive Linotype and other typesetting machines was standardized. This allowed use of a tape only five to seven holes wide to drive automatic typewriters, teleprinters and similar equipment. In 1933, IBM wanted to enter the electric typewriter market, and purchased the Electromatic Corporation, renaming the typewriter the IBM Model 01, and continuing to use the Electromatic trademark.IBM Electromatic Typewriter, National Museum of American History, Catalog Number 1987.0544.01 IBM experimented with several accessories and enhancements for its electric typewriter. In 1942, IBM filed a patent application for a typewriter that could print justified and proportionally spaced text. This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed.Waldemar A. Ayres, Printing Machine, , granted Dec. 4, 1945. IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their punched-card code.Albert W. Mills, F.J. Furman, E.J. Rabenda, Punching Apparatus, , granted Dec, 23, 1943. Eventually, IBM settled on a six-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945.Ronald D. Dodge, Automatic Justifying Typewriter, , granted Dec. 21, 1945.Ronald D. Dodge, Typewriter Punch, , granted Dec. 21, 1945. Equipping an electric typewriter with both a paper-tape reader and punch created the basic foundation for what would become the Flexowriter. By the late 1930s, IBM had a nearly complete monopoly on unit record equipment and related punched card machinery, and expanding the product line into automatic typewriters equipped with paper tape raised antitrust issues. As a result, IBM sold the product line and factory to the Commercial Controls Corporation (CCC) of Rochester, New York, which also absorbed the National Postal Meter Corporation. CCC was formed by several former IBM employees. =World War II= Around the time of World War II, CCC developed a proportional spacing model of the Flexowriter known as The Presidential (or sometimes the President). The model name was derived from the fact that these units were used to generate the White House letters informing families of the deaths of service personnel in the war. CCC also manufactured other complex mechanical devices for the war effort, including M1 carbines. In 1944, the pioneering Harvard Mark I computer was constructed, using an Electromatic for output. =Postwar= In 1950, Edwin O. Blodgett filed a patent application on behalf of Commercial Controls Corporation for a \\"tape controlled typewriter.\\" This machine used a six-level punched paper tape, and was the basis for the machines CCC and Friden built over the next 15 years.E. O. Blodgett, Tape Controlled Typewriter, , Granted Jan. 25, 1955. This improved machine was contemporaneous with the first generation of commercial computers. Applications for Flexowriters exploded in the 1950s, covering territory in commercial printing, machine tools, computers, and many forms of office automation. This versatility was helped by Friden's willingness to engineer and build many different configurations. In the late 1950s, CCC was purchased by Friden, a maker of electromechanical calculators, and it was under their name that the machines achieved their greatest diversity and success; applications are further detailed below. Two tape stations allowed implementation of what was then called the form letter, the combination of standard text (one tape) with varying name and address information (the other tape). =End of product line= Edward (Edwin?) Blodgett, Chief Engineer of Friden R&D; was replaced in 1964 while ill. It's unclear what effect this had on development, especially as Blodgett was apparently biased against electronics, favoring electromechnical solutions to design problems. Friden was acquired by the Singer Corporation in 1965. Singer had little or no understanding of the computer industry, and there was a clash of corporate culture with Friden employees. The Model 2201 Programatic There was a major redesign of the Flexowriter in the mid 1960s. The Model 2201 Programatic, introduced in 1965, had a sleek modern styling and 13 programmable function keys.The completely new 2201 FLEXOWRITER automatic writing machine by Friden (advertisement), Nation's Business, Vol. 53, No. 2 (February 1965), pages 75-76. This was the first major change in appearance of Flexowriters in nearly forty years. Programming was done using a 320-contact plugboard, and all of the logic was implemented using relays. The case, although modern looking, was entirely metal, giving the machine a shipping weight of 132 pounds (60 kg).The Friden Flexowriter, a Guided Tour, June 2016. The selling price was ¬£2900 (British pounds).Section 5 -- Peripheral Equipment, Flexowriter -- Friden 2201, British Commercial Computer Digest, 10th Ed., Pergamon, 1969; page 5/11. Although primarily sold as a stand-alone word processor (a term not yet in use at the time), Friden also sold it with a communications option allowing it to be used as a computer terminal.Friden announces on-line capability for the world's most versatile automatic writing machine (adversisement), Nation's Business, Vol. 53, No. 11 (November 1965), page 20. Members of the 2200 family operated at 135 words per minute (11.3 characters per second). The family also included the 2210 and 2211, on which the function keys were replaced with a numeric keypad, and the 2261, using ASCII instead of the proprietary eight-bit code used by other members of the 2200 family.G. W. A. Dummer, F. P. Thompson, J. M. Robertson, Friden Flexowriter Data, Banking Automation Vol. 1, pages 469-481, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1971. The 2300 series were cosmetically similar to the 2200 series, although without the function keys or numeric keypad, with a simplified plugboard, and operating at 145 words per minute (12 characters per second). In addition to the basic 2301, the 2302 supported the auxiliary tape readers and punches from the 2200 family. The 2304 offered proportional spacing and a carbon ribbon mechanism, making it suitable for preparing camera-ready copy.2300 Flexowriter Automatic Writing Machine Series, Department of the Army Pamphlet 18-510-21, June 1967; the colophon says \\"Reprinted by permission of Friden, Incorporated\\". The base price for the 2300 family was ¬£1400 (British pounds).Section 5 -- Peripheral Equipment, Flexowriter -- Friden 2300 Series, British Commercial Computer Digest, 10th Ed., Pergamon, 1969; page 5/11. This would be the last hurrah for the line, with production halting in the early 1970s. Sales and innovation declined. In the late 1960s, the market for word processing equipment was shifting to magnetic media. IBM introduced the Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) in 1964. In October, 1968, Information Control Systems introduced the Astrotype word processing system. Both of these used magnetic tape and Selectric print mechanisms. With its fixed type font and paper-tape recording medium, the Flexowriter had difficulty competing with these machines, although some Flexowriter documentation emphasized the fact that, unlike IBM's MT/ST tapes, Flexowriter users could cut and splice paper tapes, particularly if they could recognize some of the common codes such as carriage return. The Diablo daisy wheel printer, introduced in 1969, offered comparable print quality at twice the speed. Larger manufacturers such as IBM and DEC made their own console equipment, and video terminals began to appear, displacing paper-based systems. Eventually, even the CNC machine tool industry abandoned paper tape, although this was significantly slower because of the long working life of machine tools. Applications =Automatic typewriters= paper tape From its earliest days through to at least the mid-1960s, Flexowriters were used as automatic letter writers. While the US White House was using them during the Second World War, in the 1960s, United States Members of Congress used Flexowriters extensively to handle enormous volumes of routine correspondence with constituents; an advantage of this method was that these letters appeared to have been individually typed by hand. These were complemented by autopen machines which could use a pen to place a signature on letters making them appear to have been hand-signed. Auxiliary paper-tape readers could be attached to a Flexowriter to create an early form of \\"mail merge\\", where a long custom-created tape containing individual addresses and salutations was merged with a closed-loop form-letter and printed on continuous-form letterhead; both tapes contained embedded \\"control characters\\" to switch between readers. =Console terminals= As the unit record equipment (tabulating machine) industry matured and became the computer industry, Flexowriters were commonly used as console terminals for computers. Because ASCII had not yet been standardized, each type of computer tended to use its own system for encoding characters; Flexowriters were capable of being configured with numerous encodings particular to the computer the machine was being used with. Computers that used Flexowriters as consoles include: * The Electromatic on the Harvard Mark I * The MIT Whirlwind I computer, first designed to control a flight simulator, and later becoming the basis of the SAGE network. * The Lincoln Laboratory TX-0, an early experimental transistor- based minicomputer, which was to be a seminal influence on hacker culture at MIT in the late 1950s prior to the introduction of the PDP-1. * The BMEWS DIP computer, NORAD Combat Operations Center (COC), Colorado Springs, Colo., beginning in 1960. Tape code was essentially base-32. *Electrodata 205. ElectroData was purchased by the Burroughs Corporation, and many later Burroughs machines also used Flexowriters * The Librascope LGP-30 and LGP-21 * The Packard Bell PB 250 * The SEA CAB 500 * The ALWAC III-E * The English Electric KDF9. =Offline punch and printer= Flexowriters could also be used as offline punches and printers. Programmers would type their programs on Flexowriters, which would punch the program onto paper tape. The tapes could then be loaded into computers to run the programs. Computers could then use their own punches to make paper tapes that could be used by the Flexowriters to print output. Among the computers which commonly used Flexowriters for this task was the DEC PDP-1. =Machine tools= The ability to support diverse encodings meant that adapting Flexowriters to generate the paper tapes used to drive CNC machine tool equipment was a relatively simple affair, and many Flexowriters found homes in machine shops into the 1970s, when magnetic media displaced paper tape in the industry. =Unit record and early computing= Friden manufactured equipment which could connect their calculators to Flexowriters, printing output and performing unit record tasks such as form letters for bills, and eventually manufactured their own computers to further enhance these capabilities. These variants were sold as the Friden Computyper. Computypers were electromechanical; they had no electronics, at least in their earlier models. The calculator mechanism, inside a desk-like enclosure, was much like a Friden model STW desktop calculator, except that it had electrical input (via solenoids) and output (low-torque rotary switches on the dial shafts) . =Commercial printing= thumbAs well as paper tape, the same codes/holes might be punched on cards that were easy to file (this example has a pretty pattern of holes for demonstration purposes that is not actually meaningful if read by a Flexowriter) A product known as the Justowriter (or Just-O-Writer) was developed for the printing industry. It allowed typists to produce justified text for use in typesetting. This worked by having the user type the document on a Recording unit, which placed extra codes for spacing on the paper tape. The tape was placed into a second specially adapted Flexowriter which had two paper tape reading heads; one would read the text while the other controlled the spacing of the print. Spacing codes were stored in relays inside the machine as a line of text progressed. At least some Justowriters used carbon (as opposed to ink-impregnated fabric) ribbons to produce cleaner type, suitable for mass photo-set reproduction, sometimes referred to as cold type composition. The Line Casting Control or LCC product generated paper tapes for Linotype and Intertype automatic typesetters. In addition to punching a tape containing the text to be typeset, it turned on a lamp easily seen by the operator to show that the text on the line being typed could be typeset‚Äîit was within justifiable range. The LCC had a four-wheel rotary escapement, and a set of gears between the carriage rack and the escapement, to permit the smallest unit of spacing at the escapement to be quite small at the carriage. The spring-tensioned tape that moved the carriage had far more tension (possibly 20 lbs?) than did a standard Flexowriter. American Type Founders produced a phototypesetter based on the Justowriter/Flexowriter platform. =Finance= There was an \\"accounting\\" model with an ultra-wide carriage and two-color ribbon for printing out wide financial reports. The Friden accounting model was called \\"5010 COMPUTYPER\\" and was capable of arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication & division) at electronic speeds and to print the results automatically in a useful document. Hardware The power roll is the large rubber roller that continually rotates. Two rows of cams, one above and the other below, surround and engage on it. This is a bottom view. Close-up of an almost-typical cam that catches on the power roll when a key is pressed down. As a cutting edge device of their time, Flexowriters, especially some of the specialized types like typesetters, were quite costly. They were made for extreme durability. There were porous bronze bearings, many hardened steel parts, very strong springs, and a substantial AC motor to move all the parts. Most parts are made of heavy gauge steel. The housing and most removable covers were die castings. While the final Singer models did make some use of plastics, even they are quite heavy compared to other electric typewriters of their time. As a result, the platen carriage is very heavy, and when the \\"Carriage return\\" key is pressed, the carriage moves with about 20 pounds of force and enough momentum to injure a careless operator. If used only as manual typewriters, and properly maintained, Flexowriters might last a century. When reproducing form letters from punched tape, the considerable speed and loud sound of the device made watching it a somewhat frightening experience. Towards the bottom of the unit there is a large rubber roller (\\"power roll\\") that rotates continuously at a few hundred rpm. It provides power for typing as well as power-operated backspace, type basket shift, and power for engaging (and probably disengaging) the carriage return clutch. Referring to the photo of the cam assembly (often simply called a cam; it was not meant to be disassembled), the holes in the side plates at the lower left are for the assembly's pivot rod, which is fixed to the frame. At the extreme upper left is part of a disconnectable pivot that pulls down on the typing linkage. When installed, down is to the right in the photo, so to speak. Referring again to the part at the upper left, the mating part has a threaded mounting for adjusting cam clearance from the power roll. The irregular \\"roundish\\" part, lower right center, is the cam, itself. It rotates in the frame while in contact with the power roll. The surface of the cam in contact with the power roll had grooves for better grip. As the radius at the contact patch increases, the frame rotates clockwise to pull down on the linkage to type the character. This particular cam assembly has a cam that rotates a full turn for each operation; it might operate the backspace, basket shift, or carriage-return clutch disengage mechanism. Cams for typing characters rotated only half a turn, the halves of course being identical. Below the cam in this photo (hidden) is a spring-loaded lever that pushes against a pin on the cam. On the upper edge of the cam, as shown, is a little projection that engages the release lever, which is at the lowest part of the image; it's an irregular shape. When a key is pressed down, it moves the release lever and unlatches the cam for that letter; the spring-loaded lever pressing on the pin rotates the cam until it engages the power roll. As the cam continues to turn, increasing radius rotates the cam's frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) to operate the typing linkage for that character. As the cam continues to rotate, the spring- loaded lever pushes on the pin to move it toward home position, but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on another part of the release lever. The cam stalls until the key is released. When released, the lever catches the projection so the cam is now in home position. This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The \\"key-down\\" anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.) Carriage return was done by a non-stretch very durable textile tape attached to the platen advance mechanism at the left of the carriage. For a return, the tape wound up on a small reel operated from the drive system through a clutch. A cam engaged the clutch; it was disengaged by the left margin stop, perhaps directly, perhaps via another cam. (Info. needed here!) A light-torque spring kept the return tape wound on the reel. Close-up of one of the relays that controls the electrical operations The basic mechanism looks just like an IBM electric typewriter from the late 1940s. In fact, some Flexowriter parts are identical in fit and function to the early IBM electric typewriters (those with rotary carriage escapements, a gear- driven power roll, and a governor-controlled variable speed \\"universal\\" (wound-rotor/commutator) motor.) The early IBM rotary-escapement proportional- spacing typewriters (three wheel rotary escapement, spur gear differentials) had code bars to control the amount of carriage movement for the current character. They were operated by the cams. However, the Flexowriter's mechanical encoder was a very different and far more rugged design, although still operated by the cams. Close-up of the two large 50-pin connectors on the right side of a typical machine, to the rear (right of photo) is the JL1 input socket. In front of this (left of photo) is JL2 output connector with its mating Cannon plug, ready to be attached to a cable, in place Flexowriters (at least those prior to 1969) do not have transistors; electrical control operations were done with telephone-style (E-Class) relays, and troubleshooting often involved problems with the timing on the relays. Another reader has also found that the timing settings of the various leaf switches (such as in the tape reader) are also important. The screws used in the Flexowriter were unique, having large flat heads with a very narrow screwdriver slot and a unique thread size and pitch. This may have been a conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain. There is a holder for a large roll of paper tape on the back of the unit, with tape feeding around to a punch on the left side, toward the rear. The tape reader is on the same side, toward the front, and is essentially identical to the reader shown on the front of the square housing in the photo of the auxiliary reader. The right side of a Flexowriter has a large (~1\\") connector for hooking the unit up to computers and other equipment. Depending on the model, this connector may be wired in many different ways. At various times and in various configurations, flexos came with 5, 6, 7 or 8 channel paper tape reader/punches, could have several auxiliary paper tape units attached, and could also attach to IBM punched card equipment.

While giving an address to a large crowd from a balcony at Montreal City Hall, he uttered (\\"Long live Montreal, Long live Quebec!\\") and then added, followed by loud applause, (\\"Long live free Quebec!\\") with particular emphasis on the word . The phrase, a slogan used by Quebecers who favoured Quebec sovereignty, was seen as giving his support to the movement. The speech caused a diplomatic incident with Canada's government, and was condemned by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, saying that \\"Canadians do not need to be liberated\\". In France, though many were sympathetic to the cause of Quebec nationalism, de Gaulle's speech was criticized as a breach of protocol. Background Charles de Gaulle in 1963 Even before his arrival, the Canadian federal government had been concerned about President de Gaulle's visit. Earlier that year, the French government had not sent a high-level representative to the funeral service for Governor General Georges Vanier. This attracted notice in Canada, as Vanier and his wife, Pauline, had been personal friends of de Gaulle since 1940, when the latter was in exile in London, England. In April, de Gaulle did not attend the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge. So worried was the Pearson government about potential interference of France in domestic affairs that Secretary of State for External Affairs, Paul Martin, was dispatched to visit de Gaulle in Paris to mend the two countries' relationship. The Montreal Gazette speculated, 45 years after the incident, that de Gaulle was still annoyed over a perceived slight from World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King's slow recognition of the new French government in late summer 1944. In the spring of 1966, as part of the Expo 67 diplomatic protocols, de Gaulle and all world leaders whose countries had an exhibit at the fair were invited to visit Canada during the spring and summer of 1967. A few months later, de Gaulle was also sent a separate invitation to visit Quebec by Quebec premier Daniel Johnson. De Gaulle, as a visiting head of state, should have arrived in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, as would be conventional protocol. Instead, he took the time to sail on the French navy's Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser Colbert, so that he could arrive in Quebec City, the capital city of the province of Quebec. There, de Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, Roland Michener, was booed by the same crowd when viceregal salute was played at his arrival. In his speech, de Gaulle spoke of his country's \\"evolving\\" ties with Quebec, hinting at his support for Quebec sovereignty. Speech Montreal City Hall's balcony where De Gaulle gave his speech. On July 15, before boarding the Colbert, de Gaulle told Xavier Deniau: \\"They will hear me over there, it will make waves!\\" He also confided to his son-in-law General Alain de Boissieu that: \\"I am going to strike a strong blow. Things are going to get hot. But it is necessary. It is the last chance to rectify the cowardice of France.\\" De Gaulle was referring to what he viewed as France's abandonment of 70,000 French colonists to the British after France was defeated in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War in 1763. On July 24, de Gaulle arrived in Montreal and was driven up the Chemin du Roy to Montreal City Hall, where Mayor Jean Drapeau and Premier Johnson waited. De Gaulle was not scheduled to speak that evening, but the crowd chanted for him; he told Drapeau: \\"I have to speak to those people who are calling for me\\". According to a number of personal interviews with high-ranking French officials, as well as documents he uncovered, scholar Dale C. Thomson wrote that de Gaulle's statement was planned, and that he used it when the opportunity presented itself. De Gaulle stepped out onto the balcony to give a short address to the assembled masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the liberation from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words (\\"Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!\\"), but he then added, (\\"Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!\\"), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, . De Gaulle particularly emphasized the use of the word , as he leaned into the microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech. Reaction This statement, coming from the French head of state, was considered a serious breach of diplomatic protocol. It emboldened the Quebec sovereignty movement, and produced tensions between the leadership of the two countries. The crowd's reaction to De Gaulle's phrase was emotional and it sparked controversy with many English Canadians afterwards, as they were outraged at the implied threat to Canada's territorial integrity. Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson rebuked de Gaulle with an official statement, delivered to the French Embassy on July 25, and read on national television that evening. He said \\"The people of Canada are free. Every province in Canada is free. Canadians do not need to be liberated. Indeed, many thousands of Canadians gave their lives in two world wars in the liberation of France and other European countries.\\" A media and diplomatic uproar ensued thereafter, which resulted in de Gaulle cutting short his visit to Canada. The day after the speech, de Gaulle visited Expo 67 and hosted a banquet at the French pavilion. On July 26, instead of continuing his visit on to Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pearson, he decided to return to France on a French military jet. The newly appointed Canadian minister of justice, Pierre Trudeau, publicly wondered what the French reaction would have been if a Canadian Prime Minister shouted, \\"Brittany to the Bretons\\". From then on, de Gaulle remained unimpressed by Trudeau, saying (\\"We have not one concession, nor even any courtesy, to extend to Mr. Trudeau, who is the enemy of the 'French fact' in Canada.\\") De Gaulle was also heavily criticized by a large part of the French media for his breach of international protocol, in particular by Le Monde. Meanwhile, to members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the speech was viewed as a watershed moment. Occurring soon after the Quiet Revolution, and taking into account the low economic and political state of French Canadians at the time, the support of a foreign head of state seemed to add credibility to the movement in the eyes of many, including future Quebec premier Ren√© L√©vesque. On the flight home from Montreal, de Gaulle told Ren√© de Saint-L√©gier de la Saussaye‚Äîhis diplomatic counsellor‚Äîthat the event was \\"a historical phenomenon that was perhaps foreseeable but it took a form that only the situation itself could determine. Of course, like many others I could have got away with a few polite remarks or diplomatic acrobatics, but when one is General De Gaulle, one does not have recourse to such expedients. What I did, I had to do it.\\" In 1969, de Gaulle visited Brittany, during which, in Quimper, he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called Charles de Gaulle) in the Breton language, expressing devotion to Breton culture. The speech, well received by the crowd, followed a series of crackdowns on Breton nationalism. He was accused of double standards for, on the one hand demanding a free Quebec, while on the other oppressing the movement in Brittany. During this Quimper speech, he replied to this criticism that Brittany was free and had been freed by Bretons and other French forces during the Liberation, reminding them that the Resistance was more intense in Brittany than in any other part of France, and that many Bretons had joined the Free French Forces.

The website was created by GHDpro on December 26, 2002. Animesuki was not a tracker; instead, it provided links to many trackers across the web. It did not list pornography or series that had been licensed in North America. However, in 2013 it stopped maintaining its database of torrents, and the forums remain as the only active part of the site. Legal status The site only linked to anime that had not been licensed by any American companies. Once a title was licensed, the corresponding fansub links were removed from the site and the series was listed on its licensed list. Nonetheless, although none of the files were hosted on the site itself, AnimeSuki could be held accountable for violating copyright law, as linking to sites that themselves infringe on the law has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Though fansubs are technically copyright violations, AnimeSuki's legal page alleges that the WTO TRIPS Agreement specifies that the distribution of copyrighted material is only necessarily illegal when done on a commercial scale, thus making it difficult for anyone besides the copyright holder to prosecute fansubbers. To date, only one Japanese company, Media Factory, has requested its content removed from the site. However, Funimation and Kadokawa Pictures USA have also sent them separate cease and desist letters concerning several titles, which were promptly removed. In Singapore, Odex has targeted AnimeSuki's users with legal action. AnimeSuki was also known for erring on the side of caution regarding licenses. Even though some series such as Hanaukyo Maids were not initially licensed, AnimeSuki kept them from being listed because of the likelihood that Geneon would secure the rights to it. Present Over time, AnimeSuki experienced a decline in new fansub entries, due to various changes in online anime distribution, such as preference to download episodes directly from trackers and translators' websites, competition with other database websites, frequent updates and disbandment of translation groups. But since the growing popularity of video streaming websites such as Crunchyroll, FunimationNow, HIDIVE, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which provide licensed anime and can stream to smartphones, AnimeSuki has ceased all updates and activity. As of February 15, 2019, the main website is closed. However, as of 2020, the discussion boards remain active.

Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their farmhouse, along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and Sheila's six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas Caffell. The only surviving member of June and Nevill's immediate family was their adopted son, Jeremy Bamber, then 24 years old, who said he had been at home a few miles away when the shooting took place.; . The police at first believed that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed the gun in his unstable sister's hands to make it look like a murder‚Äìsuicide. A silencer, the prosecution said, was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10‚Äì2 majority verdict, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002. Bamber protested his innocence throughout, although his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They argued that the silencer might not have been used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.; for extended family, 19‚Äì20. A key issue was whether Bamber had received a call from his father that night to say Sheila had \\"gone berserk\\" with a gun. Bamber said that he did, that he alerted police, and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it‚Äîindeed, the only way he could have known about the shootings when he alerted the police‚Äîwas that he was the killer himself. Bamber family =June and Nevill Bamber= Nevill and June Bamber. A key issue was whether their daughter Sheila was strong enough to have subdued Nevill, who was 6' 4\\" tall, in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen. Ralph Nevill Bamber (known as Nevill, born 8 June 1924, 61 when he died) was a farmer, former RAF pilot, and local magistrate at Witham Magistrates' Court. He and his wife, June (n√©e Speakman, born 3 June 1924, also 61 when she died), had married in 1949 and moved into the Georgian White House Farm on Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, set among 300 acres of tenant farmland that had belonged to June's father.For dates of birth, ; for the other biographical details, . The Court of Appeal described Nevill as \\"a well-built man, 6 feet 4 inches tall and in good physical health\\". This became significant because Bamber's defence suggested that Sheila, a slim woman of 28, had been able to beat and subdue her father, something the prosecution contested. Unable to have biological children, the couple adopted Sheila and Jeremy as babies; the children were not related to each other. June suffered from depression and had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the 1950s‚Äîincluding in 1958 after Sheila's adoption‚Äîwhere she was given electroshock therapy at least six times. In 1982, she was treated by Hugh Ferguson, a psychiatrist who later saw Sheila. The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, property in London, 300 acres of land and a caravan site. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her.; for religion, also see . Sheila's ex-husband was concerned about the effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.; . =Daniel and Nicholas Caffell= Daniel and Nicholas Caffell (born 22 June 1979, six when they died) were born to Sheila and Colin Caffell, who married in 1977 and divorced in 1980. Colin was an art student when he met Sheila. Both parents were involved in the children's upbringing after the divorce,; although the boys were briefly placed in foster care in 198283 because of Sheila's health problems. For several months before the murders, they had been living with Colin in his home in Kilburn, north London, not far from Sheila's home in Maida Vale.; . A week- long visit to White House Farm had been arranged for August 1985 at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant to stay at the farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat.; . When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, it was the last time he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the urn with her ashes was placed in their coffin.. =Sheila Caffell= Background Nicholas, Sheila and Daniel Caffell, circa 1984 Sheila Jean \\"Bambs\\" Caffell (born 18 July 1957, 28 when she died)For \\"Bambs\\", ; for the date of birth, . was born to the 18-year-old daughter of a senior chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury. At his insistence, the baby was placed for adoption. Her mother gave her up to the Church of England Children's Society two weeks after the birth, and Sheila was adopted by the Bambers in October 1957. The chaplain had known Nevill in the RAF and selected the Bambers from a list of prospective adopters. After school Sheila attended secretarial college in Swiss Cottage, London.; ; . In 1974, when she was 17, she discovered she was pregnant by Colin Caffell. The Bambers arranged an abortion. Her relationship with her mother deteriorated significantly that summer, when June found Sheila and Colin sunbathing naked in a field. June reportedly started calling Sheila the \\"devil's child\\".; . Sheila continued with her secretarial course, then trained as a hairdresser, and briefly worked as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo.; . After she became pregnant again, she married Colin at Chelmsford Register Office in May 1977, but miscarried in the sixth month. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, she gave birth to Nicolas and Daniel. Just before this, Colin apparently began an affair and left Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left her 21st birthday party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist.; . The couple divorced in May 1982. After the divorce, Nevill bought Sheila a flat in Morshead Mansions, Maida Vale, and Colin helped to raise the children from his home in nearby Kilburn. Sheila decided to trace her birth mother, then living in Canada. They met at Heathrow Airport in 1982 for a brief reunion, but the relationship did not develop. At around this time she became friendly with a group of young women who nicknamed her \\"Bambi\\", and who later told reporters that she was desperately insecure, often complaining about her poor relationship with her mother. There was a lot of partying and drugs, particularly cocaine, and fraternisations with older men.; . Sheila's brief modelling career had ended after the birth of the boys, and she lived on welfare or took low-paying jobs, including as a waitress for one week at School Dinners, a London restaurant in which dinner was served by young women in school uniform, stockings and suspenders. There were also cleaning jobs, and there was one episode of nude photography, much regretted.; . Health Sheila's mental health continued to decline, with episodes of banging her head against walls. In 1983 her family doctor referred her to Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said Sheila was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility, where Ferguson diagnosed a schizoaffective disorder. After she was discharged in September 1983, he continued seeing her as an out-patient, and concluded that his first diagnosis had been mistaken. He now believed that she was suffering from schizophrenia and began treating her with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug.; . Ferguson wrote that Sheila believed the devil had given her the power to project evil onto others, and that she could make her sons have sex and cause violence with her. She called them the \\"devil's children\\", the phrase June had used of Sheila, and said she believed she was capable of murdering them or of getting them to kill others. She spoke about suicide, although the court heard that Ferguson did not regard her as a suicide risk. She was re-admitted to St Andrew's in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a psychotic episode in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that certain people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her.; ; . She was discharged four weeks later, and as an outpatient received a monthly injection of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that has a sedative effect. From that point, the twins lived all or most of the time with Colin in Kilburn. According to Bamber, the family discussed placing the boys in daytime foster care over dinner on the night of the murders, with little response from Sheila. Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her psychiatrist told the court that the kind of violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, he said he did not believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother.; Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, told the court that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult. =Jeremy Bamber= Bamber shortly after his arrest in September 1985. Jeremy Nevill Bamber was born on 13 January 1961 to a student midwife who, after an affair with a married army sergeant, gave her baby to the Church of England Children's Society when he was six weeks old. His biological parents later married and had other children; his father became a senior staff member in Buckingham Palace.; . Nevill and June adopted Bamber when he was six months old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary, then along with Sheila to Maldon Court prep school. This was followed when he was nine, in September 1970, by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, where he joined the cadet force.\\"Parents tormented by private anguish over flawed children\\". The Times. 29 October 1986. He was apparently unhappy there, mainly because of bullying and a sexual assault. After leaving Gresham's with no qualifications, Bamber attended sixth-form college, and in 1978 achieved seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where he took a scuba-diving course, before travelling to New Zealand. Former friends alleged that he had broken into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, of being involved in smuggling heroin. He returned to England in 1982 to work on his adoptive parents' farm for ¬£170 a week, and set up home, rent-free, in a cottage Nevill owned at 9 Head Street, Goldhanger, Essex. The cottage lay 3‚Äì3.5 miles (5.6 km) from the farmhouse, a five-minute drive by car and at least 15 minutes by bicycle. His father also gave him a car to use, and eight percent of a family company, Osea Road Camp Sites Ltd, which ran a caravan site. Bamber lived in Head Street, Goldhanger, Essex To Bamber's supporters, who over the years have included MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice.Allison, Eric and Townsend, Mark (30 January 2011).\\"The new evidence Jeremy Bamber says could end his 26 years in prison\\", The Observer. The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as \\"clever and strategic\\", they wrote that there was something about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was \\"handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way‚Äîhe seemed to exude arrogance and indifference. ... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions.\\"Allison, Eric and Hattenstone, Simon (10 February 2011). \\"Is Jeremy Bamber innocent?\\", The Guardian. He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.Galloway, George (15 May 2007). \\"Lie Detectors: Jeremy Bamber\\". House of Commons. His detractors include his extended family and his father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said.\\"Slaughter At The Farm\\". Countdown to Murder. Channel 5, 13 November 2013, from 00:10:40. Tension had apparently increased in the weeks before the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a \\"shooting accident\\".Kennedy, Dominic (8 November 2013). \\"Jeremy Bamber's father 'foresaw' family slaughter at farm\\". The Times. Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: \\"I'm not going to share my money with my sister.\\" The court heard that, in March that year, while discussing security at the family's caravan site, he had told his uncle: \\"I could kill anybody. I could even [or \\"easily\\"] kill my parents.\\" Bamber denied having said this. =Extended family, inheritance= The financial ties and inheritance issues within the immediate and extended family provided a motive and added a layer of complexity to the case. The Bambers' company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ¬£400,000 in 1985 (c. ¬£1,057,000 in 2016). In their wills, June left ¬£230,000 (c. ¬£608,000) and Nevill ¬£380,000 (c. ¬£1,004,000). During the murder trial, the court heard that the Bambers had left their estate to Jeremy and Sheila, to be divided equally. In addition, Nevill's will had said that, to inherit, Bamber had to be working on the farm at the time of his father's death. The court also heard, from the mother of Bamber's girlfriend, that Bamber had been saying June wanted to change her will to bypass him and Sheila, and leave her estate to the twins instead. The parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It was one of those cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution. Because of Bamber's conviction, the estate passed instead to the cousins.. One moved into White House Farm, while that cousin and several others acquired full ownership of the caravan site and other buildings..Moore, Matthew (12 July 2010). \\"Jeremy Bamber claims he was framed for murder by cousins\\", The Daily Telegraph. This conflict of interest became a bone of contention, as did the apparent failure of the police to search and secure the crime scene. Bamber argues that the family set him up, a claim that one of the group dismissed in 2010 as \\"an absolute load of piffle\\". Bamber launched two legal actions while in prison to secure a share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them.\\"Killer's family cash claim fails\\", BBC News, 6 October 2004. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover ¬£1.2m from the estate of his maternal grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister‚Äîthe grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested‚Äîand that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there.\\"Bamber claims ¬£1m from family\\". BBC News, 18 August 2003; Ezard, John (19 August 2003). \\"Murder family sued by killer\\". The Guardian. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a ¬£326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him. Bamber's visit to the farm =Atmosphere in the house= On 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with June and Nevill. The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual. Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy.. One of the crime- scene photographs showed that someone had carved \\"I hate this place\\" into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping. Bamber visited the farm on the evening of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that during his visit his parents suggested to Sheila that the boys be placed in daytime foster care with a local family; he said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Ferguson told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.. A farmworker heard Bamber leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill at around that time, and was left with the impression that she had interrupted an argument. She said Nevill was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal. =Murder weapon= Bamber told the court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, thinking he heard rabbits outside, but had not used it. He left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine and a box of ammunition, before leaving the house.. It did not at that point have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said. Both had been on the rifle in late July, according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.. Nevill kept several guns at the farm. He was reportedly careful with them, cleaning them after use and securing them.. He had bought the gun, a .22 Ansch√ºtz semi- automatic rifle, model 525, on 30 November 1984, along with a Parker Hale silencer, telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition.; . It used cartridges, which were loaded into a magazine that held ten cartridges. Twenty-five shots were fired during the killing, so if the rifle was fully loaded to begin with, it would have been reloaded at least twice. The court heard that the magazine became harder to load with each cartridge; loading the tenth was described as \\"exceptionally hard\\".; . The rifle had normally been used to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight had to be removed with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it.. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26‚Äì28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground- floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.. Police logs, 7 August 1985 =Telephones in the farmhouse= There were three telephones at the farm on the night, all on the same landline. There was usually a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom on Nevill's bedside table; a beige Statesman digital phone in the kitchen; and a blue Sceptre 100 digital phone in the office on the first floor. (There was a fourth phone too, an Envoy cordless phone in the kitchen, but it had been picked up for repair on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the main bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige Statesman digital phone still in the kitchen but hidden in a pile of magazines.. =Bamber's call to police= Bamber telephoned Chelmsford police station (and not the 999 emergency number) from his home in the early hours of 7 August to raise the alarm. He told them he had received a telephone call from his father‚Äîfrom the White House Farm landline to the landline at Bamber's home‚Äîto say that Sheila had \\"gone berserk\\" with a gun. Bamber said the line went dead in the middle of the call.; for \\"gone berserk\\", \\"Jury told of Bamber's 'fatal mistake'\\", The Guardian, 22 October 1986, p. 2, and . The prosecution argued that Bamber had received no such call, and that his claim to have done so was part of his setting the scene to blame Sheila. Nevill was \\"severely bloodied\\" at that point, according to the Court of Appeal, but the telephone had \\"no visible blood\\" on it when police examined the scene, although it was acknowledged that no swabs had been taken. It was Bamber, the prosecution said, who had left the kitchen telephone off the hook after calling his home from White House Farm to establish that part of his alibi. After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom operator checked the White House Farm line‚Äîat 3:56 am according to the police log, and at 4:30am according to the Court of Appeal‚Äîand found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking.:File:Jeremy Bamber police log.JPG, Essex police log, 7 August 1985; . British Telecom did not at the time keep records of local calls. According to experts who testified at the trial, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for 1‚Äì2 minutes. During this time, Bamber would not have been able to use his telephone... Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it.. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.. =Logs= Event log In 2010 Bamber's lawyers highlighted two police logs in support of Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position that there were two calls, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber. One log shows that Bamber rang the local police station and spoke to PC Michael West in the information room. As a result West began an \\"event log\\".. This states that Bamber's call came in at 3:36 am on 7 August 1985. Bamber maintains that he telephoned 10 minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a digital clock, and that the call had probably come in just before 3:26 am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35am. The event log noted a call from: Radio log: \\"Daughter gone berserk\\".Collins, Nick (5 August 2019). \\"Jeremy Bamber murders: new evidence could clear killer\\". The Daily Telegraph. The Appeal Court noted that Bamber said he had \\"tried to ring his father back at White House Farm but he could not get a reply\\". During the trial, the court heard that Bamber said his father had not hung up after speaking and that he could hear noise in the background. At some point PC West spoke to Bamber again on the telephone; Bamber apparently complained about the time the police were taking, saying: \\"When my father rang he sounded terrified.\\" He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Radio log Michael Bonnett, a civilian dispatcher in Chelmsford HQ information room, began a \\"radio log\\", which kept track of messages about the situation. The radio log discusses a telephone call made at 3:26 am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call known to have been made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. According to the defence, the radio log is not simply a duplicate log of Bamber's call but a log of a separate call to the police by Nevill.. The radio log is headed \\"Daughter gone berserk\\": \\"Mr Bamber, White House Farm, Tolleshunt d‚ÄôArcy‚Äîdaughter Sheila Bamber, aged 26 years, has got hold of one of my guns.\\" It adds: \\"Message passed to CD by the son of Mr Bamber after phone went dead.\\" It goes on to say: \\"Mr Bamber has a collection of shotguns and .410s\\", and it includes White House Farm's telephone number: 860209\\\\. The final entry says: \\"0356 GPO [the telephone operator] have checked phone line to farmhouse and confirm phone left off hook.\\" The radio log shows that a patrol car, Charlie Alpha 7 (CA7)‚Äînot Charlie Alpha 5, as mentioned in the event log‚Äîwas sent to the scene at 3:35 am. Scene at White House Farm =Events outside= Pages Lane leading to White House Farm After the telephone calls, Bamber drove to the farmhouse, as did three officers from Witham Police Station who later testified that Bamber had been driving much more slowly than them; they passed him on Pages Lane and arrived at the farmhouse one or two minutes before him. His cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that Bamber was normally a fast driver. The group waited outside the house for a tactical firearms unit to arrive, which turned up at 5 am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all the doors and windows to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.. While waiting outside, the police questioned Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, Bamber told them about the phone call from his father and that it had sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have \\"gone berserk with a gun\\", the police said he replied: \\"I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment.\\" The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the sort of person who might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site \\"would be able to stand him a Porsche\\" soon. Bamber told the police that Sheila was familiar with guns and that they had gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby.. A doctor who was called to the house testified the deaths could have occurred at any time during the night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock: Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly placing Sheila's sons in foster care.. =Scene inside= Apparent struggle The police entered at 7:54 am, using a sledgehammer to break the back door. The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs in the kitchen and the rest upstairs.. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range.. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several .22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, a broken ceiling light, and what looked like blood on the floor. Nevill Nevill was found in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an overturned chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle.. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found‚Äîthree in the kitchen and one on the stairs‚Äîthe police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.. There were two wounds to his right side, and two to the top of his head, which would probably have resulted in unconsciousness. The left side of his lip was wounded, his jaw was fractured, and his teeth, neck and larynx were damaged. The pathologist said he \\"would not have been able to engage in purposeful talk\\", according to the Court of Appeal. There were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow. The court heard that he had \\"black eyes and a broken nose, linear bruising to the cheeks, lacerations to the head, linear type bruising to the right forearm, bruising to the left wrist and forearm and three circular burn type marks to the back. The linear marks were consistent with Mr Bamber having been struck with a long blunt object, possibly a gun.\\". One of the pillars of the prosecution case was that Sheila would not have been strong enough to inflict this beating on Nevill, who was 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall and by all accounts in good health. June June's body and clothing were heavily bloodstained; she was found in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found lying on the floor by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on the right side of her chest and right knee.. Daniel and Nicholas The boys were found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They appeared to have been shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times in the back of the head, four times with the gun held within one foot of his head, and once from over two feet away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.. Sheila Sheila was found on the floor of the master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the injuries had occurred from three inches (76 mm) away and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. The pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries, he said.. Blood and urine samples indicated that she had taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains on the back of her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean. There was no blood on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar that was on the downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and forehead at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A forensic scientist, Brian Elliott, testified that if Sheila had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The blood on her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm- discharge residue was on it.For the forensic scientist's name, see . Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, it was hard to see how she could have carried the cartridges. The rifle, without the silencer or sights attached, was lying on her body pointing up at her neck. June's Bible lay on the floor to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others that could not be identified, including one made by a child.. Police investigation =Murder-suicide theory, crime scene= Front page of the Daily Express, 8 August 1985. The police and media were at first convinced by the murder-suicide theory. DCI Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Bamber's cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Bamber had set the whole thing up. The Daily Express reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders: > A farming family affectionately dubbed \\"The Archers\\" was slaughtered in a > bloodbath yesterday. Brandishing a gun taken from her father's collection, > deranged divorcee Sheila Bamber, 28, first shot her twin six-year-old sons. > She gunned down her father as he tried to phone for help. Then she murdered > her mother before turning the automatic .22 rifle on herself. The result of this certainty was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, and it was not examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house. The police did not find the silencer in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with what appeared to be flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed. After Bamber was convicted, the trial judge, Mr Justice Drake, expressed concern about the \\"less than thorough investigation\\",. while The Times wrote about \\"blunders, omissions and ineptitude\\".Horsnell, Michael (29 October 1986). \\"Detectives' blunders let Bamber roam free\\". The Times. Issue 62601, p. 3; . Home Secretary Douglas Hurd requested a report on the investigation from Essex Chief Constable Robert Bunyard and in March 1989 issued a statement in the House of Commons: \\"It is clear that errors were made in the early stages of the police investigation contrary to existing force practice.\\"Douglas Hurd, \\"Jeremy Bamber, Hansard, 23 March 1989, column 804. =Funeral, Bamber's behaviour= The inquest opened on 14 August 1985. The police gave evidence that it was a murder‚Äìsuicide, and the bodies were released. The Bambers and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, he was smiling and joking. Shortly after the funerals, he travelled to Amsterdam with Mugford and a friend, where he bought a large quantity of cannabis; the travel agent who sold the tickets said the group had been in high spirits. Bamber also began selling his family's belongings; Mugford's mother was offered June's car and an ad was placed in a local newspaper asking ¬£900 for Nevill's. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Bamber tried to sell 20 nude photographs of Sheila for ¬£20,000 to The Sun, and went on another overseas trip with a friend, Brett, this time to Saint-Tropez. =Fingerprints on rifle= A print from Sheila's right ring finger was found on the right side of the butt, pointing downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified. . =Silencer= The silencer was not on the gun when the police found the bodies. It was found by one of Bamber's cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard. Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue. The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself. Forensic tests indicated that her arms were not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached. If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going back upstairs to shoot herself. If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Bamber had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had \\"gone berserk\\" with the gun.. The police searched the gun cupboard on the day of the murders but found nothing. Three days later, on 10 August, Bamber's extended family visited the farm with Basil Cock, the estate's executor. During that visit, one of the cousins, David Boutflour, found the silencer and rifle sights in the gun cupboard. The court heard that this was witnessed by Boutflour's father and sister, as well as by Basil Cock and the farm secretary.. Instead of alerting the police, the family took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, and the surface of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, five days after the murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon.. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, John Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although it could have been a mixture of Nevill's and June's.; . A firearms expert, Malcolm Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.; . =Scratch marks on mantelpiece= The cousins returned to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. A sample taken by a scenes-of-crime officer was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts of the marks on the mantelpiece were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact with the mantel several times.. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun. =Julie Mugford's statements= Background On 7 September 1985, a month after the murders, Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, changed her statement to police, now alleging that Bamber had been planning to kill his family. As a result of her second statement, Bamber was arrested the following day.. Bamber and Mugford had started dating in 1983, when she was 19 and studying for a degree in education at Goldsmith's College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe's, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. During police interviews, Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty. In 1985 she had been cautioned for using a friend's chequebook to obtain goods worth around ¬£700, after it had been reported stolen; she said that she and the friend had repaid the money to the bank. She also acknowledged having helped Bamber, in March 1985, steal just under ¬£1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned; she said that he had staged a break-in to make it appear that strangers were responsible.. Statements to police Mugford was at first supportive of Bamber. Photographs of his parents' and Sheila's funeral show him weeping and hanging onto her arm. During an interview with the police on the day after the murders, she said that Bamber had telephoned her at home in the early hours of 7 August, between 3:00 and 3:30 am, and said, \\"There's something wrong at home,\\" and sounded worried. She said she had been tired and had not asked what was wrong.. Her position changed the following month. She'd had a series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on the 4th of September 1985, another woman telephoned Bamber in Mugford's presence. It became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing the woman. Mugford smashed a mirror and slapped Bamber; he then twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.; . In the second statement, she alleged that between July and October 1984, Bamber had said he wished he could \\"get rid of them all\\". He had talked disparagingly about his \\"old\\" father and \\"mad\\" mother, she said, who were trying to \\"run his life\\". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said.. In discussions she said she had dismissed as \\"idle talk\\", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside.. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger \\"because the last phone call made would be recorded\\". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him that he would not be able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so. \\"Tonight or never\\" allegation Mugford said she had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the prosecution later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse on the night of the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50 pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was \\"pissed off\\", and that it was \\"tonight or never\\". A few hours later, at 3:00‚Äì3:30 am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: \\"Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night ... bye honey and I love you lots.\\" Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00 am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: \\"I should have been an actor.\\" Later on the evening of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber allegedly said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from one of the phones in the farmhouse that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, he would have an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend ¬£2,000. Letter about Mugford A letter dated 26 September 1985 from the assistant director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone.Eric Allison, \\"Jeremy Bamber in new challenge to conviction for murdering family\\", The Guardian, 29 March 2012.\\"Jeremy Bamber: prosecutor's correspondence with police‚Äîfull documents\\", The Guardian, 29 March 2012. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ¬£25,000 (¬£ in 2016).. =Bamber's arrest= As a result of Mugford's statement, Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said the only reason he had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs window, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case. Charged on 9 September with breaking into the Osea Bay caravan site on 25 March 1985 and stealing ¬£980, he was released on bail on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez with a friend. Shortly before this, he tried to sell his life story and nude photographs of Sheila to The Sun newspaper for ¬£20,000.; Before leaving England, he returned to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was arrested at Dover and charged with the murders.; ; Trial, October 1986 =Prosecution case= A: Bamber's home in Head Street, Goldhanger B: White House Farm, Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D'Arcy. The trial, which lasted 18 days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr. Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court. The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC.Connett, David (8 August 2010). \\"Past crimes: The Bamber files\\". The Independent. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: \\"That is what you have got to establish.\\" The prosecution case was that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10 pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, to drive to his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps in the early hours of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle‚Äîwhich he had borrowed a few days earlier‚Äîcycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.; for the prosecution's summary, . He had shot June in her bed; she had managed to walk a few steps before collapsing and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice in the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.. Bamber had then arranged the scene to make it appear that Sheila was the killer, they said. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. After removing the kitchen phone from its hook, he left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled back to Goldhanger on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3 am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26 am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter. The prosecution argued that Bamber had not received a telephone call from his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.. The silencer played a central role. It was deemed to have been on the rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact. =Defence case= The defence maintained that the witnesses who said Bamber disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words. Mugford had lied about Bamber's confession, they said, because he had betrayed her. No one had seen Bamber cycle to and from the farm. There were no marks on him on the night in question that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid, they said. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killings and since. The defence argued that Sheila was the killer, and that she did know how to handle guns, because she had been raised on a farm and had attended shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.; . A former boyfriend of hers gave a written statement to the court that Sheila had had some kind of breakdown in March 1985, in his presence, when she began beating the wall with her fists because the telephone line had gone dead during a call; she had said the phone was bugged and talked about God and the devil, and how the latter loved her. He said he had feared for the safety of people around her. He also said Sheila had a \\"deep and intense dislike\\" of June, her adoptive mother. The defence argued that people who have carried out so-called \\"altruistic\\" killings have been known to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in the cupboard, changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead on her hands, or why sugar from the floor was not found on her feet. There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill's and June's. =Summing up, verdict= Home Secretary Douglas Hurd (pictured in 2013) decided in 1988 that Bamber should never be released. The judge told the jury that there were three crucial points, in no particular order. Did they believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, she could not have fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber in the middle of the night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders. On 28 October, after deliberating more than nine hours, the jury found Bamber guilty by a majority of ten to two (the minimum required for conviction). Sentencing him to five life terms, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years, the judge told him: \\"Your conduct in planning and carrying out the killing of five members of your family was evil, almost beyond belief.\\" In December 1994, Home Secretary Michael Howard told Bamber that he would remain in prison for the rest of his life, following a decision in 1988 by the home secretary of the day, Douglas Hurd.; for Hurd, also see ; for Howard, also see Campbell, Duncan (29 April 1985). \\"Bamber loses plea over life term ruling\\", The Guardian. Appeals =Leave to appeal refused, 1989 and 1994= Bamber first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury. The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988. During a full hearing in March 1989 before three Appeal Court judges‚ÄîLord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice; Mr Justice Roch; and Mr Justice Henry‚ÄîBamber's lawyer, Geoffrey Rivlin QC, argued that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, and that he had undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. Rivlin also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers.; On 20 March 1989 the judges refused Bamber leave to appeal, ruling that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts. Because the trial judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an internal inquiry. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This investigation uncovered more material, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994. During this process, the Home Office declined to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of their decision in November 1994, which resulted in the Home Office handing over the evidence. In 1996 a police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits, saying later he had not been aware that the case was ongoing. Bamber's defence team referred to the destruction of blood samples as a \\"disgrace\\". =Court of Appeal, 2002= Criminal Cases Review Commission referral In 1997 the Home Office passed Bamber's case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which had just been established to review alleged miscarriages of justice. In March 2001 the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal because of the discovery of DNA inside the silencer; this was found as a result of a test not available in 1986 and constituted fresh evidence. Bamber's conviction rested in part on evidence that Sheila's blood had been found inside the silencer, suggesting that it had been on the gun when she died; but her arms were not long enough to point the gun back at herself and pull the trigger with the silencer attached. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002, at the Royal Courts of Justice, by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges concluded that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right.Sarah Hall, \\"Bamber loses appeal over murder convictions\\", The Guardian, 13 December 2002. Grounds Bamber initially brought 16 issues to the attention of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence. The defence withdrew ground 11 (\\"the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant\\") before the hearing. > *Ground 1a ‚Äì \\"hand swabs from Sheila Caffell\\"; . *1b ‚Äì \\"the testing of the > hand swabs from Sheila Caffell\\"; . *2 ‚Äì \\"disturbance of the crime scene\\"; . > *3 ‚Äì \\"evidence relating to windows\\"; . *4 ‚Äì \\"timing of phone call to Julie > Mugford\\"; . *5 ‚Äì \\"evidence relevant to the credibility of Julie Mugford\\"; . > *6 ‚Äì \\"letter from Colin Caffell\\"; . *7 ‚Äì \\"the statement of Colin Caffell\\"; . > *8 ‚Äì \\"photograph showing carving of the words 'I hate this place'\\"; . *9 ‚Äì > \\"the Bible\\"; . *10 ‚Äì \\"the question of inheritance\\"; . *11 ‚Äì \\"the proposed > purchase of a Porsche by the appellant\\" *12 ‚Äì \\"the telephone in the office\\"; > . *13 ‚Äì \\"scars on the appellant's hands\\"; . *14 and 15 ‚Äì \\"blood in the sound > moderator\\"; . *15 ‚Äì \\"DNA evidence\\"; . *16 ‚Äì \\"police misconduct\\"; . New silencer evidence Bamber's appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice was dismissed in December 2002. Although all the grounds (except 11) were reviewed by the court, the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis of ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986. The silencer evidence during the trial had come from John Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the Forensic Science Laboratory. He had found a \\"considerable amount of blood\\" inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila. He said there was a \\"remote possibility\\" that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June.; for Hayward, . Mark Webster, an expert instructed by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, and that there was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed. The defence argued that new tests comparing DNA in the silencer to a sample from Sheila's biological mother suggested that the \\"major component\\" of the DNA in the silencer had not come from Sheila. A DNA sample from June's sister suggested that the major component had come from June, the defence argued. The court concluded that June's DNA was in the silencer, that Sheila's DNA may have been in the silencer, and that there was evidence of DNA from at least one male. The judges' conclusion was that the results were complex, incomplete, and also meaningless because they did not establish how June's DNA came to be in the silencer years after the trial, did not establish that Sheila's was not in it, and did not lead to a conclusion that Bamber's conviction was unsafe.; Horsnell, Michael (13 December 2002). \\"Bamber loses appeal over five murders\\". The Times. p. 14. =Against whole-life tariff= In 2008 Bamber lost a High Court appeal before Mr Justice Tugendhat against his whole-life tariff.. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2009.; \\"Killer's life term is 'justified'\\", BBC News, 14 May 2009. Bamber and three other British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was rejected in 2012.\\"Murderers lose appeal against whole life tariffs\\", BBC News, 17 January 2012. Bamber and two of the prisoners (one of them the serial killer Peter Moore) appealed that decision, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.\\"Killers' life terms 'breach their human rights'\\", BBC News, 9 July 2013. Campaign =Background= Peter Tatchell appealed in 2015 for all evidence related to the case to be released to the defence. A campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Bamber's release.\\"J B Campaign Ltd\\", Companies House. The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and The Guardian ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993, which included a telephone interview with Bamber from Long Lartin prison; Bamber said he still could not understand why he had been convicted.; From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Bamber used one of the sites to offer a ¬£1m reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction.\\"Murderer's website sparks anger\\". Birmingham Evening Mail. 5 March 2001; \\"Killer Bamber offers ¬£1m reward\\". BBC News, 22 December 2002. Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Bamber to his parents at their graveside, and a \\"Bamber bake-off\\" featuring his mother's favourite recipes.Boyle, Danny (2 March 2016). \\"Jeremy Bamber sends campaigner to record graveside message asserting his innocence\\", The Daily Telegraph. Harley, Nicola (15 July 2015). \\"Killer Jeremy Bamber's supporters defend bake-off event\\", The Daily Telegraph. Bamber's case was taken up by MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison became one of the campaign's patrons.Hunter, Andrew (9 February 2005). \\"Jeremy Bamber\\", House of Commons.\\"MP 'would offer bail' for killer\\". BBC News. 8 December 2004; \\"Interview with Eric Allison\\". JB Campaign Ltd, courtesy of YouTube, 15 December 2016. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police gathered outside before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber was guilty.McKinstry, Leo (7 April 2012). \\"Lack of appeal\\", The Spectator; . In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case.\\"Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell signs petition for disclosure of Jeremy Bamber evidence\\". ITV News, 29 September 2015. =Campaign's arguments= Location of Sheila's body, time of death The defence disputed the location of Sheila's body. The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother. According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man.; also see . A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs.\\"Maldon: Detective rejects new evidence Bambi went 'berserk' as farcical\\" , Essex Chronicle, 12 August 2010. Bamber's lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30 am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9 am. They argued that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside the house with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally. Alleged crime-scene damage The defence argued that the first officers to enter the farmhouse had inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, then reconstructed it. Crime- scene photographs not made available to the original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body. The gun itself also appears to have moved. Former Lancashire Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell, shown the photographs by the Guardian and Observer, said in 2011: \\"The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again to make it look like it was originally. And if that has happened, and that hasn't been disclosed, that is really, really serious.\\"; Gradwell, Mick (10 February 2011). \\"Which adopted child shot farmhouse family?\\" Lancashire Evening Post. Arguments about the silencer The contention that the gun had a silencer on it during the murders was central to the prosecution's case; Bamber and his lawyers have sought since 1987 to demolish the silencer evidence. With the silencer fitted, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned it on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed to have been made during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate‚Äîdays after the police had searched the house‚Äîblighted the prosecution's case, although it was accepted by a majority of the jury. Lee writes that the silencer evidence became confused because of the way the exhibit was named. It was first called \\"SBJ/1\\", because it was handed over by DS Stan Jones (SBJ). When it was learned that David Boutflour had found it, the silencer was renamed exhibit \\"DB/1\\". But because there was a DC David Bird, it was renamed again to \\"DRB/1\\". The name changes led to confusion in later documents, giving the impression that more than one silencer had been found. In 2011, Lee writes, Bamber's blog announced: \\"We can now prove 100% that there were two sound moderators obtained by police at different times.\\" The CCRC responded that year that the claims were \\"not supported by the material that exists ...\\". Again in 2013 Bamber's blog said: \\"I can now prove with 100% certainty that Essex police seized one Parker Hale (MM1 type) suppressor from the house on 7 August 1985\\" (the day of the murder, rather than the day the cousin found it). According to The Times in 2013, Bamber aimed to show that the police had taken four silencers from his family members, including the one in the gun cupboard, and that evidence and paperwork from them‚Äîand from an additional laboratory silencer‚Äîhad been mixed up..Kennedy, Dominic (2 December 2013). \\"Bamber challenges murder conviction over gun evidence\\". The Times. Issue 71057. p. 23. In or around 2012, Bamber's lawyers commissioned gun experts from the US and UK to examine photographs of the bodies and the silencer evidence. They argued that injuries on the bodies were consistent with the silencer not having been used, and that its absence would explain burn marks on Nevill's body.Allison, Eric and Townsend, Mark (4 February 2012). \\"Gun experts raise doubts over Jeremy Bamber murder verdict\\", The Observer. The court had heard that \\"three circular burn type marks\\" had been found on Nevill's back. In November 1985 a police report submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions had argued that the burn marks were made with the hot end of the gun or with a poker from the Aga. Arguments about scratch marks The defence commissioned a report from Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken on the day of the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece had been found on or inside the silencer.Mark Townsend, Eric Allison, \\"Jeremy Bamber did not murder his family, insists court expert\\", The Observer, 21 February 2010.Mark Townsend, Eric Allison, Shehani Fernando, Maggie Kane, \\"Jeremy Bamber conviction challenged by new photographic evidence\\", The Observer, 21 February 2010.. Sutherst said the scratch marks appeared in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 days after the murders, but were not visible in the original crime- scene photographs. He also said he had failed to find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes.Eric Allison, Mark Townsend, \\"The new evidence Jeremy Bamber says could end his 26 years in prison\\", The Observer, 30 January 2011. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders. Arguments about police logs Police telephone logs had been entered as evidence during the trial, but had not been noticed by Bamber's lawyers. Bamber's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Nevill called police that night to say his daughter had \\"gone berserk\\" with one of his guns. A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response. Police say the officers simply made a mistake.. Arguments about Mugford letter Bamber's lawyers argued that the 26 September 1985 letter to Julie Mugford from John Walker, assistant director of public prosecutions, raised the possibility that Mugford had been persuaded to testify in the hope that charges against her would not be pursued. In the letter, Walker had suggested to the Chief Constable of Essex Police, \\"with considerable hesitation\\", that Mugford not be prosecuted for drug offences, burglary and cheque fraud, offences to which she had confessed during her police interviews regarding Bamber. The defence team also highlighted that, as soon as the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ¬£25,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Criminal Cases Review Commission, 2004‚Äì2012 In 2004 Bamber's defence team, which included Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully to have the CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal.\\"Bamber in new bid to clear name\\", BBC News, 2 August 2005. His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC provisionally rejected Bamber's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline to allow them to study all 406 crime-scene photographs,Eric Allison, Peter Walker, \\"Jeremy Bamber loses attempt to appeal\\", The Guardian, 11 February 2011.\\"Jeremy Bamber's lawyers given more time to prepare case\\", BBC News, 19 July 2011. and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry.\\"Jeremy Bamber's lawyers get further time to prepare\\", BBC News, 2 September 2011. The CCRC finally rejected the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that would raise the real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the conviction.\\"Family killer Jeremy Bamber fails in appeal bid\\", BBC News, 26 April 2012. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision.\\"Jeremy Bamber's latest action against conviction fails\\", BBC News, 29 November 2012.

As of June 2017, DePaiva plays the recurring role of Dr. David Bensch on the ABC soap opera General Hospital. Personal life DePaiva is the oldest of four children born to Ronald J. DePaiva and his wife Rosemarie. DePaiva's second marriage was to former Hee Haw actress Misty Rowe on June 4, 1986; they divorced in 1995. They had one daughter, Dreama Marie (born July 2, 1992). While on One Life to Live, DePaiva's married his co-star Kassie Wesley on May 31, 1996. They have one son, James Quentin (J. Q.), born May 12, 1997. J. Q. is hearing impaired and had implants prior to age one. In late 2007, J. Q. appeared on All My Children on Erica Kane's television show at her request in hopes this would help her daughter Kendall deal with the hearing loss of her own son Spike. DePaiva is a descendant of former US President Andrew Johnson. Prior to starting his professional acting career, DePaiva spent several years as a musician. One of the bands he played with was Livewire, based out of Livermore, CA. DePaiva played bass.

The New Adventures were authorised novels carrying on from where the Doctor Who television series had left off, and Summerfield was introduced in Cornell's novel Love and War in 1992. History A 26th century archeologist, Summerfield became a hugely popular character amongst fans of the books, and was present right up until their end in 1997. She officially stopped travelling with the Doctor in Happy Endings but returned a few times thereafter, including the last Virgin New Adventure, The Dying Days. That year, Virgin had lost the licence to publish Doctor Who fiction, which was not renewed by the BBC. However, range editors Peter Darvill-Evans and Rebecca Levene decided to continue the series with Summerfield as the new lead and without the Doctor Who name, the Doctor or any other BBC copyright characters featuring. These New Adventures starring Bernice continued until 1999, when the Virgin fiction department closed down. The previous year, however, audio production company Big Finish Productions began issuing full-cast, officially licensed professional audio dramas starring the character on CD, and they continue to do so. The character is played in all Big Finish's productions by actress Lisa Bowerman, who also reprised the role in the live-action fan film The Crystal Conundrum and a video advertisement for the audio The Triumph of Sutekh. After they gained the license to produce Doctor Who audio dramas in 1999, Big Finish thrice featured Bernice in Doctor Who stories set during and after the run of the New Adventures novels. Big Finish are still regularly producing Bernice Summerfield audio dramas and the company has also published various novels and short story collections featuring the character. Bernice also appeared in several comic strips in Doctor Who Magazine, with Virgin and the magazine co- operating on her visual depiction. This depiction, which was also applied to novel cover art, was of a slim, statuesque build, with short dark hair, usually shown wearing a catsuit or some similar outfit. Over time, the character's appearance has been modified and among recent changes include a longer hairstyle.

She was born in 2540 and is the daughter of Admiral Isaac Douglas Summerfield - a high ranking Spacefleet officer. Her mother, Claire Summerfield, died when Daleks attacked their homeworld of Beta Caprisis, an Earth colony. She has not seen her father for many years and has spent much of her life searching for him. At times she falsely claims to have a degree from Heidelberg University. She published an archaeological book called Down Among the Dead Men in the year 2566. Theatre of War features the first encounter between Bernice and Irving Braxiatel (from her perspective). He later becomes a regular character in the Bernice Summerfield-only New Adventures. In Sanctuary Bernice falls in love with Guy de Carnac, a former Knight Templar. Unfortunately he is killed later in the novel. In Death and Diplomacy she meets her future husband Jason Kane, who she marries in the very next novel, Happy Endings. Happy Endings is set on the occasion of Bernice's wedding to Jason Kane. Bernice leaves the TARDIS after this novel having been given Time Rings by the Doctor, but she appears in certain subsequent Doctor Who novels. In Return of the Living Dad, Bernice finally resolves the mystery of what happened to her father. Virgin had long considered a non-Doctor Who spin-off series, but plans were moved forwards when they lost the license from the BBC. A number of preparations were made for the transition to Bernice-led New Adventures (see below). As Virgin felt Bernice would make a better lead as a single woman, her marriage to Jason Kane was split up. Thus, she appears again in Eternity Weeps, a novel which describes the breakdown of her marriage and is also focused on her more than the Doctor as a prototype for the Doctor-free novels to come. Likewise, the last New Adventure, The Dying Days, is again focused on Bernice more than the Doctor, with the Doctor absent from a substantial portion of the book. The Dying Days also features an ambiguous epilogue which can be taken to imply that the Doctor and Bernice have sex. This same epilogue also has the Doctor indicating that Benny is his longest- serving companion, although exactly how long she travelled with the Doctor has never been firmly established. =The New Adventures= *Oh No It Isn't! by Paul Cornell *Dragons' Wrath by Justin Richards *Beyond the Sun by Matt Jones *Ship of Fools by Dave Stone *Down by Lawrence Miles *Deadfall by Gary Russell *Ghost Devices by Simon Bucher-Jones *Mean Streets by Terrance Dicks *Tempest by Christopher Bulis *Walking to Babylon by Kate Orman *Oblivion by Dave Stone *The Medusa Effect by Justin Richards *Dry Pilgrimage by Paul Leonard and Nick Walters *The Sword of Forever by Jim Mortimore *Another Girl, Another Planet by Martin Day and Len Beech *Beige Planet Mars by Lance Parkin and Mark Clapham *Where Angels Fear by Rebecca Levene and Simon Winstone *The Mary-Sue Extrusion by Dave Stone *Dead Romance by Lawrence Miles (Bernice Summerfield does not appear) *Tears of the Oracle by Justin Richards *Return to the Fractured Planet by Dave Stone *The Joy Device by Justin Richards *Twilight of the Gods by Mark Clapham and Jon de Burgh Miller Originally published monthly, the New Adventures went bimonthly after The Sword of Forever. The New Adventures continued with Bernice generally in the leading role. Oh No It Isn't! provides the set-up for subsequent stories, with Bernice becoming Professor of Archaeology at St Oscar's University on the planet Dellah. She has now put her failed marriage to Jason Kane behind her. Oh No It Isn't! also re-introduces the People, a highly advanced alien race from the Doctor Who New Adventures. In Ghost Devices, we meet Clarence (named after the angel in It's a Wonderful Life). Clarence appears in the form of an angel, but is an artificial intelligence from the People who is eventually (in Tears of the Oracle) revealed to be a character from The Also People. In Dragons' Wrath, Bernice meets Irving Braxiatel for the first time (from his perspective). Beyond the Sun introduces another recurring character, Emile Mars-Smith. Emile, Clarence and the People appear in a number of subsequent New Adventures, while Braxiatel appears in both further New Adventures and Benny stories from Big Finish. Where Angels Fear starts the Gods arc, a loose overarching story that finishes in Twilight of the Gods. Along the way, Dellah is destroyed and Bernice is uprooted and loses her memory. Twilight of the Gods finishes with a new set-up for subsequent stories involving Bernice, Emile and others, but this was not used as Virgin stopped publishing the series. As well as continuing the New Adventures after losing the Doctor Who license, Virgin also continued with their Decalog series. These had been Doctor Who short story anthologies, but Decalog 5: Wonders featured a Benny short story (\\"The Judgement of Solomon\\") by Lawrence Miles alongside other shorts not set in the New Adventures continuity. =Big Finish paperback novels= *The Doomsday Manuscript by Justin Richards *The Gods of the Underworld by Stephen Cole *The Squire's Crystal by Jacqueline Rayner *The Infernal Nexus by Dave Stone *The Glass Prison by Jacqueline Rayner Big Finish licensed the character of Bernice Summerfield from Paul Cornell, Irving Braxiatel from Justin Richards and Jason Kane from Dave Stone, but other elements of the Virgin New Adventures' fictional universe were not obtained. Instead, Gary Russell, Jacqueline Rayner and Cornell developed a new background and character ensemble, introduced in the anthology The Dead Men Diaries and developed in the initial run of paperbacks. The most notable development in Big Finish's paperback novels was Bernice's pregnancy and the birth of her son in The Glass Prison. The paperback novels proved uneconomic and Big Finish stopped publishing them, subsequently re-launching their Benny books in hardback with the anthology A Life of Surprises. =Big Finish hardcover novels= *The Big Hunt by Lance Parkin *The Tree of Life by Mark Michalowski *Genius Loci by Ben Aaronovitch *The Two Jasons by Dave Stone *Terra Incognita by Ben Aaronovitch ‚Äî originally announced in 2007, this novel remains unpublished save for an extract in Missing Adventures *The Weather on Versimmon by Matthew Griffiths *The Slender-Fingered Cats of Bubastis by Xanna Eve Chown *Filthy Lucre by James Parsons and Andrew Stirling-Brown *Adorable Illusion by Gary Russell =Big Finish novellas= Each volume comprises a collection of three novellas. *A Life in Pieces by Dave Stone, Paul Sutton and Joseph Lidster *Parallel Lives by Rebecca Levene, Stewart Sheargold and Dave Stone, with linking material by Simon Guerrier *Old Friends by Jonathan Clements, Marc Platt and Pete Kempshall *Nobody's Children by Kate Orman, Jonathan Blum and Philip Purser-Hallard *The Vampire Curse by Mags L Halliday, Kelly Hale and Philip Purser-Hallard =Big Finish anthologies= *The Dead Men Diaries, edited by Paul Cornell *A Life of Surprises, edited by Paul Cornell *Life During Wartime, edited by Paul Cornell *A Life Worth Living, edited by Simon Guerrier *Something Changed, edited by Simon Guerrier *Collected Works, edited by Nick Wallace *Missing Adventures, edited by Rebecca Levene *Secret Histories, edited by Mark Clapham *Present Danger, edited by Eddie Robson *True Stories (2017), edited by Xanna Eve Chown *In Time (2018), edited by Xanna Eve Chown =Short Trips= Bernice also appears in a number of Doctor Who short stories, mostly set during her travels with the Doctor. *\\"The Trials of Tara\\" by Paul Cornell (Decalog 2: Lost Property) *\\"Continuity Errors\\" by Steven Moffat (Decalog 3: Consequences) *\\"The Judgement of Soloman\\" by Lawrence Miles (Decalog 5: Wonders) *\\"Virgin Lands\\" by Sarah Groenewegen (Short Trips: Zodiac) *\\"Of the Mermaid and Jupiter\\" by Ian Mond & Danny Heap (Short Trips: Past Tense) *\\"Cold War\\" by Rebecca Levene (Short Trips: Steel Skies) *\\"...Be Forgot\\" by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright (Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury) - set during Big Finish's Bernice audio series *\\"Too Rich for My Blood\\" by Rebecca Levene (Short Trips: Seven Deadly Sins) *\\"How You Get There\\" by Simon Guerrier (Short Trips: A Day in the Life) *\\"Larkspur\\" by Mark Stevens (Short Trips: Transmissions) =New Series Adventures= Bernice appears in one of the New Series Adventures with the Twelfth Doctor (the novel was originally planned for River Song, but plans for the 2015 Christmas special The Husbands of River Song prompted Russell to use Benny instead). *Big Bang Generation by Gary Russell Audio plays =Bernice Summerfield= Season 1 (1998‚Äì2000) The first season of Bernice Summerfield audio plays are all adaptations of New Adventures novels originally published by Virgin Publishing. Each of the plays spans two CDs, except for Dragon's Wrath, which was issued on a single CD. The plays deviate from the original novels, in terms of plot and characters, to varying degrees. This is particularly evident with the productions of Birthright and Just War, both of which were originally Doctor Who novels. These changes were necessary because, at the time of their production, Big Finish Productions weren't licensed to produce Doctor Who audio plays. Actor and photographer Lisa Bowerman was cast in the role of Bernice Summerfield. Bowerman had previously appeared in the Doctor Who story Survival (1989). The first series also co- starred Stephen Fewell as Jason Kane. A variety of actors familiar to Doctor Who fans played guest roles in many of the plays, including Colin Baker, Sophie Aldred, Nicholas Courtney, Elisabeth Sladen, Anneke Wills and Richard Franklin. Season 2 (2000‚Äì01) For the second season of Bernice Summerfield audio plays, Big Finish Productions experimented by developing ongoing character arcs that alternated between two different mediums--the audio plays and novels. Fans who did not collect the novels were initially confused to discover that Benny was pregnant during the final audio play of the season, The Skymines of Karthos. The pregnancy was explained in the novel The Squire's Crystal by Jacqueline Rayner. The run of plays from the second season onwards take part in what has become known as the Collection continuity, as they are set primarily on the Braxiatel Collection, a combined museum and university located on the planetoid KS-159. A number of regular characters are introduced, most notably Irving Braxiatel. First referenced in the 1979 Doctor Who story City of Death (written by Douglas Adams and Graham Williams), Braxiatel first appeared in person in the New Adventures novel Theatre of War. Season 3 (2002‚Äì03) Whereas the previous seasons had focused primarily on the character of Bernice Summerfield, Big Finish used the third season as an opportunity to introduce an ensemble feel to the productions. This is most evident in The Green-Eyed Monsters and The Mirror Effect where the characters Jason Kane, Adrian Wall and Irving Braxiatel are significantly developed. The latter, in particular, suggests that Braxiatel has a darker, more mysterious past than the audience has previously been led to believe. The other two plays that comprise the third season focus more specifically on Bernice. The Greatest Shop in the Galaxy remains the most light-hearted play of the season, while The Dance of the Dead reintroduces the Ice Warriors from Doctor Who. While not officially part of the third season (at least as far as the numbering is concerned), the Bernice Summerfield audio play The Plague Herds of Excelis (the fourth play in Big Finish's Excelis series; the first three plays fall under the Doctor Who umbrella) takes place between The Green-Eyed Monsters and The Dance of the Dead. Chronologically, the short story anthology A Life of Surprises also falls within this gap. Season 4 (2003‚Äì04) The fourth season was unofficially dubbed the \\"classic Who monsters\\" season, with each play featuring an alien adversary that previously appeared in the Doctor Who television series. The Bellotron Incident predominantly features the Rutan Host (their major enemies, the Sontarans, are also referred to but don't actually appear), The Draconian Rage features the Draconians, The Poison Seas casts a more sympathetic light on the Sea Devils, while Death and the Daleks (the first double CD release in the series since Just War) sees the first appearance of the Daleks within the Bernice Summerfield series. Prior to its release, Death and the Daleks was entitled The Axis of Evil to keep the appearance of the Daleks a secret. Big Finish also published an anthology of short stories, entitled Life During Wartime, that was specially written as a prelude to the Death and the Daleks audio play. Paul Cornell, the anthology's editor, described Life During Wartime as \\"a novel written by multiple authors\\". Each of the collection's stories are told in chronological order, detailing events that occur when the Collection is occupied by a powerful alien force. The anthology ends on a cliff-hanger that is resolved in Death and the Daleks. Season 5 (2004‚Äì05) The previous season's tradition of using classic monsters continues into the fifth season, with the Grel (previously heard in Oh No It Isn't!) returning in The Grel Escape, a knowing pastiche of The Chase. The Bone of Contention features the Galyari, who appeared in the Doctor Who audio play The Sandman, while the title and plot of The Relics of Jegg-Sau was inspired by a 1970s Doctor Who licensed jigsaw puzzle that depicted a scene with giant robots identical to the one that appeared in Robot. The Masquerade of Death brings the fifth season to a close in a suitably dark and surreal fashion. Season 6 (2005‚Äì06) By the end of The Crystal of Cantus, the true dark and manipulative nature of Braxiatel was revealed and he left the Collection. Its future is now uncertain, with the Draconians claiming they own the planetoid on what it is based. The entire series was directed by Gary Russell. Season 7 (2006) The seventh season follows the staff of the Collection as they attempt to keep things running smoothly in Braxiatel's absence. Collected Works and Old Friends, two books published during this season's run, also develop the running plots that planetoid KS-159 is under threat from the Draconians and Mim, and that the Collection itself is falling apart literally as well as figuratively without Braxiatel at its helm. Season 8 (2007‚Äì08) In the eighth season, Braxiatel returns to the Collection, which is threatened by crossfire and politics in the war between the Draconians and Mim. The war comes to an unexpected conclusion shortly after his return, and several regular characters pay a heavy price for realising too late that Braxiatel himself is the real threat. The season ends with Benny cutting her ties to the Collection and Braxiatel, and going on the run with her son Peter. The books The Two Jasons and Nobody's Children also fit into this season's arc. Season 9 (2008) The ninth season is a much looser collection of stories, following Bernice and her son Peter as Benny searches for work away from the Collection. Season 10 (2009) The entire series was directed by John Ainsworth. Season 11 (2010) The entire series was again directed by John Ainsworth. The animated short Dead and Buried acted as a prelude to this series.

For the main encyclopedia article, see Loop quantum gravity. The history of loop quantum gravity spans more than three decades of intense research. History =Classical theories of gravitation= General relativity is the theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to it, the force of gravity is a manifestation of the local geometry of spacetime. Mathematically, the theory is modelled after Bernhard Riemann's metric geometry, but the Lorentz group of spacetime symmetries (an essential ingredient of Einstein's own theory of special relativity) replaces the group of rotational symmetries of space. (Later, loop quantum gravity inherited this geometric interpretation of gravity, and posits that a quantum theory of gravity is fundamentally a quantum theory of spacetime.) In the 1920s, the French mathematician √âlie Cartan formulated Einstein's theory in the language of bundles and connections,√âlie Cartan. \\"Sur une g√©n√©ralisation de la notion de courbure de Riemann et les espaces √† torsion.\\" C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) 174, 593‚Äì595 (1922); √âlie Cartan. \\"Sur les vari√©t√©s √† connexion affine et la th√©orie de la relativit√© g√©n√©ralis√©e.\\" Part I: Ann. √âc. Norm. 40, 325‚Äì412 (1923) and ibid. 41, 1‚Äì25 (1924); Part II: ibid. 42, 17‚Äì88 (1925). a generalization of Riemannian geometry to which Cartan made important contributions. The so-called Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory of gravity not only reformulated but also generalized general relativity, and allowed spacetimes with torsion as well as curvature. In Cartan's geometry of bundles, the concept of parallel transport is more fundamental than that of distance, the centerpiece of Riemannian geometry. A similar conceptual shift occurs between the invariant interval of Einstein's general relativity and the parallel transport of Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory. =Spin networks= In 1971, physicist Roger Penrose explored the idea of space arising from a quantum combinatorial structure.Roger Penrose, \\"Applications of negative dimensional tensors,\\" in Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications, Academic Press (1971).Roger Penrose, \\"Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial space-time\\" in Quantum Theory and Beyond,\\" ed. Ted Bastin, Cambridge University Press, 1971. His investigations resulted in the development of spin networks. Because this was a quantum theory of the rotational group and not the Lorentz group, Penrose went on to develop twistors. =Loop quantum gravity= In 1982, Amitabha Sen tried to formulate a Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity based on spinorial variables, where these variables are the left and right spinorial component equivalents of Einstein‚ÄìCartan connection of general relativity.Amitabha Sen, \\"Gravity as a spin system,\\" Phys. Lett. B119:89‚Äì91, December 1982. Particularly, Sen discovered a new way to write down the two constraints of the ADM Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity in terms of these spinorial connections. In his form, the constraints are simply conditions that the spinorial Weyl curvature is trace free and symmetric. He also discovered the presence of new constraints which he suggested to be interpreted as the equivalent of Gauss constraint of Yang‚ÄìMills field theories. But Sen's work fell short of giving a full clear systematic theory and particularly failed to clearly discuss the conjugate momenta to the spinorial variables, its physical interpretation, and its relation to the metric (in his work he indicated this as some lambda variable). In 1986‚Äì87, physicist Abhay Ashtekar completed the project which Amitabha Sen began. He clearly identified the fundamental conjugate variables of spinorial gravity: The configuration variable is as a spinoral connection (a rule for parallel transport; technically, a connection) and the conjugate momentum variable is a coordinate frame (called a vierbein) at each point.Abhay Ashtekar, \\"New variables for classical and quantum gravity,\\" Phys. Rev. Lett., 57, 2244-2247, 1986.Abhay Ashtekar, \\"New Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity,\\" Phys. Rev. D36, 1587-1602, 1987. So these variable became what we know as Ashtekar variables, a particular flavor of Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory with a complex connection. General relativity theory expressed in this way, made possible to pursue quantization of it using well- known techniques from quantum gauge field theory. The quantization of gravity in the Ashtekar formulation was based on Wilson loops, a technique developed by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1974 to study the strong-interaction regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is interesting in this connection that Wilson loops were known to be ill-behaved in the case of standard quantum field theory on (flat) Minkowski space, and so did not provide a nonperturbative quantization of QCD. However, because the Ashtekar formulation was background-independent, it was possible to use Wilson loops as the basis for nonperturbative quantization of gravity. Due to efforts by Sen and Ashtekar a setting in which the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation was written in terms of a well-defined Hamiltonian operator on a well-defined Hilbert space was obtained. This led to the construction of the first known exact solution, the so-called Chern‚ÄìSimons form or Kodama state. The physical interpretation of this state remains obscure. In 1988‚Äì90, Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin obtained an explicit basis of states of quantum geometry, which turned out to be labeled by Penrose's spin networks.Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin, \\"Knot theory and quantum gravity,\\" Phys. Rev. Lett., 61 (1988) 1155.Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin, \\"Loop space representation of quantum general relativity,\\" Nuclear Physics B331 (1990) 80-152. In this context, spin networks arose as a generalization of Wilson loops necessary to deal with mutually intersecting loops. Mathematically, spin networks are related to group representation theory and can be used to construct knot invariants such as the Jones polynomial. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) thus became related to topological quantum field theory and group representation theory. In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin showed that the quantum operators of the theory associated to area and volume have a discrete spectrum.Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin, \\"Discreteness of area and volume in quantum gravity\\" (1994): arXiv:gr-qc/9411005. Work on the semi-classical limit, the continuum limit, and dynamics was intense after this, but progress was slower. On the semi-classical limit front, the goal is to obtain and study analogues of the harmonic oscillator coherent states (candidates are known as weave states). =Hamiltonian dynamics= LQG was initially formulated as a quantization of the Hamiltonian ADM formalism, according to which the Einstein equations are a collection of constraints (Gauss, Diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian). The kinematics are encoded in the Gauss and Diffeomorphism constraints, whose solution is the space spanned by the spin network basis. The problem is to define the Hamiltonian constraint as a self-adjoint operator on the kinematical state space. The most promising work in this direction is Thomas Thiemann's Phoenix Project. =Covariant dynamics= Much of the recent work in LQG has been done in the covariant formulation of the theory, called \\"spin foam theory.\\" The present version of the covariant dynamics is due to the convergent work of different groups, but it is commonly named after a paper by Jonathan Engle, Roberto Pereira and Carlo Rovelli in 2007‚Äì08.Jonathan Engle, Roberto Pereira, Carlo Rovelli, \\"Flipped spinfoam vertex and loop gravity\\". Nucl. Phys. B798 (2008). 251‚Äì290. arXiv:0708.1236. Heuristically, it would be expected that evolution between spin network states might be described by discrete combinatorial operations on the spin networks, which would then trace a two-dimensional skeleton of spacetime. This approach is related to state-sum models of statistical mechanics and topological quantum field theory such as the Turaeev‚ÄìViro model of 3D quantum gravity, and also to the Regge calculus approach to calculate the Feynman path integral of general relativity by discretizing spacetime.

The interior houses a 13th-century pulpit, formerly in the church of San Pier Scheraggio, and transferred here in 1782. That church was demolished during the construction of the Uffizi. The square elevated pulpit has delicately carved bas-relief square marble panels, depicting various biblical scenes: * Adoration of the Magi * Madonna and child * Evangelists and the Dream of the Virgin * Baptism of Christ * Presentation of Christ at the Temple * Nativity of Christ * Deposition from the Cross The main altarpiece presently is a 15th-century triptych by Lorenzo di Niccol√≤, depicting an Enthroned Madonna and Child flanked by depictions of Saints Anthony Abbot, Leonard, James the Apostle, and Lawrence. Another altarpiece depicts Archangel Raphael with Tobias, St Leonard, and St Sebastian (circa 1478) by followers of Neri di Bicci. Two altarpieces are attributed to Neri di Bicci: including a Madonna of the Assumption grants a belt to St Thomas, flanked by Saints Peter, Jerome, Francis, and John the Baptist. Cosimo Ulivelli painted some frescoes in the apse.I dintorni di Firenze: Sulla sinistra dell'Arno I dintorni di Firenze: Sulla sinistra dell'Arno, by Guido Carocci, Florence (1907): pages 223-224. Dante and Boccaccio are said to have preached from the pulpit. The church stands among olive groves on the Via San Leonardo, a country road on the southern outskirts of Florence, next to Villa Spelman, seat of the Johns Hopkins University Charles S.

Wolfhall Farm, all that remains of Wulfhall Hall, home of the Seymours Sir John Seymour of Wulfhall in the parish of Great Bedwyn in the Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, Knight banneret (c. 1474 ‚Äì 21 December 1536) was an English soldier and a courtier who served both Henry VII and Henry VIII. Born into a prominent gentry family, he is best known as the father of the Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour, and hence grandfather of king Edward VI of England. Family The Seymours were descendants of an Anglo-Norman family that took its name from St. Maur-sur-Loire in Touraine. William de St. Maur in 1240 held the manors of Penhow and Woundy (now called Undy in Monmouthshire). William's great-grandson, Sir Roger de St. Maur, had two sons: John, whose granddaughter conveyed these manors by marriage into the family of Bowlay of Penhow, who bore the Seymour arms; and Sir Roger (c.1308 ‚Äì Before 1366), who married Cicely, eldest sister and heir of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp. Cicely brought to the Seymours the manor of Hache, Somerset, and her grandson, Roger Seymour, by his marriage with Maud, daughter and heir of Sir William Esturmy, acquired Wulfhall (or Wolf Hall) in Wiltshire. Sir John Seymour, was a great-great-grandson of this Roger Seymour. Sir John Seymour, was born around 1474, the eldest son of John Seymour (c. 1450 ‚Äì 26 October 1491) of Wulfhall, Wiltshire, by his marriage to Elizabeth Darell (or Darrell) (born c. 1451). He married Margery, the daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and his wife Anne Say. Anne was the daughter of Sir John Say and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Lawrence Cheney (or Cheyne) (c.1396‚Äì1461) and Elizabeth Cokayne. Margery Wentworth's grandfather, Sir Philip Wentworth, had married Mary, daughter of John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford, whose mother Elizabeth was daughter of Henry Percy (Hotspur) and great-great-granddaughter of Edward III. Margery was renowned for her beauty as well as her quiet and gentle demeanour, and she came to the attention of the poet, John Skelton. Career He succeeded his father in 1492 and was knighted in the field by Henry VII for his services against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath on 17 June 1497. He was made Knight banneret in 1513. He was present at the sieges of Th√©rouanne and Tournay in 1513 as well as the two meetings between Henry VIII and Francis I:‚Äì the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 and again in 1532. =Offices held= His offices included: * Warden, Savernake Forest, Wiltshire October 1491 * Sheriff, Wiltshire 1498‚Äì1499, 1507‚Äì1508, 1518‚Äì19, 1524 ‚Äì January 1526 * Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset 1515‚Äì1516, 1526‚Äì1527 * Justice of the peace Wiltshire 1499‚Äì1536 * Steward, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham's lands, Wiltshire by 1503 * Knight of the body by 1509 * Constable and door-ward, Bristol Castle, Gloucestershire August 1509, jointly.

Hertfordshire. Of the ten children born at Wulfhall, six survived:‚Äì three sons: Edward, Henry and Thomas, and three daughters: Jane, Dorothy and Elizabeth. Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth were courtiers. Edward and Thomas, would both be executed during the reign of Edward VI. Henry Seymour, who lacked his brothers' ambition, lived away from court, in relative obscurity. He also had an illegitimate son: * Sir John Seymour (c. 1530 ‚Äì before August 1599), married in March 1568 Jane or Joan Poyntz, daughter of Sir Nicholas Poyntz and Joan Berkeley. =Notable children= Four of the Seymour children achieved prominence at the royal court:‚Äì Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth. Jane Seymour, the eldest surviving daughter, was a maid of honour of Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then later of Anne Boleyn. Henry VIII stayed at Wulfhall with Queen Anne in the summer of 1535 for a few days. In early 1536, Henry declared his love for Jane and began spending increasing amounts of time with her, chaperoned by her brother, Edward. Henry and Jane were officially betrothed the day after Anne Boleyn was arrested and executed on charges of treason, adultery and incest. After Jane became queen on 30 May 1536, her family scaled the social ranks, as was befitting the family of a royal consort. Her eldest brother, Edward, was made an earl and eventually a duke and briefly ruled England on behalf of his nephew, King Edward VI. Her second brother, Thomas, was made a baron and Lord High Admiral, and in 1547 eloped with Henry VIII's widow, Queen Catherine Parr. Both Edward and Thomas were beheaded for treason, a few years apart. Seymour's second daughter, Elizabeth, was first married to Sir Anthony Ughtred (c.1478 ‚Äì 1534), secondly to Gregory Cromwell (c.1520 ‚Äì 1551), son of Henry VIII's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, and for a third time to John Paulet, Baron St John (c.1510 ‚Äì 1576), who succeeded his father as Marquess of Winchester in 1572.

Note the six fleurs-de-lis on the lady's left sleeve in the Holbein portrait above. Elizabeth Seymour ( ‚Äì 19 March 1568) was a younger daughter of Sir John Seymour of Wulfhall, Wiltshire and Margery Wentworth. Elizabeth and her sister Jane served in the household of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII. In his quest for a male heir, the king had divorced his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, whose only surviving child was a daughter, Mary. His marriage to Anne Boleyn had also resulted in a single daughter, Elizabeth. The queen's miscarriage of a son in January 1536 sealed her fate. The king, convinced that Anne could never give him male children, increasingly infatuated with Jane Seymour, and encouraged by the queen's enemies, was determined to replace her. The Seymours rose to prominence after the king's attention turned to Jane. In May 1536, Anne Boleyn was accused of treason and adultery with Mark Smeaton, a court musician, the courtiers Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton and her brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. The trials and executions of the queen and her co-accused followed swiftly,The imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys reported to Charles V that the queen and those accused with her, \\"were condemned upon presumption and certain indications, without valid proof or confession\\". and on 30 May 1536, eleven days after Anne's execution, Henry VIII and Jane were married. Elizabeth was not included in her sister's household during her brief reign, although she would serve two of Henry VIII's later wives, Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard. Jane died 24 October 1537, twelve days after giving birth to a healthy son, Edward VI. Elizabeth lived under four Tudor monarchs and was married three times. By July 1530 she had married Sir Anthony Ughtred, Governor of Jersey, who died in 1534. She then married Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, the son of Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII in 1537, who died in 1551. She married her third and last husband, Sir John Paulet, later Lord St. John, the son of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester in 1554. Seymour family The Seymour family took its name from St. Maur-sur-Loire in Touraine. William de St. Maur in 1240 held the manors of Penhow and Woundy (now called Undy in Monmouthshire). William's great- grandson, Sir Roger de St. Maur, had two sons: John, whose granddaughter conveyed these manors by marriage into the family of Bowlay of Penhow, who bore the Seymour arms; and Sir Roger ( ‚Äì Bef. 1366), who married Cicely, eldest sister and heir of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp. Cicely brought to the Seymours the manor of Hache, Somerset, and her grandson, Roger Seymour, by his marriage with Maud, daughter and heir of Sir William Esturmy, acquired Wolf Hall in Wiltshire. Elizabeth's father, Sir John Seymour, was a great-great-grandson of this Roger Seymour. Sir John Seymour was born in 1474. He succeeded his father in 1492, was knighted by Henry VII for his services against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath in 1497, and was sheriff of Wiltshire in 1508. He was present at the sieges of Th√©rouanne and Tournay in 1513, at the two interviews between Henry VIII and Francis I in 1520 and 1532, and died on 21 December 1536. He married Margery, the daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and his wife Anne Say. Anne was the daughter of Sir John Say and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Lawrence Cheney (or Cheyne) ( ‚Äì 1461) and Elizabeth Cokayne. Margery Wentworth's grandfather, Sir Philip Wentworth, had married Mary, daughter of John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford, whose mother Elizabeth was daughter of Henry Percy (Hotspur) and great-great- granddaughter of Edward III. Sir John Seymour (1474 ‚Äì 21 December 1536), of Wulfhall, Savernake, Wiltshire, and Margery Wentworth ( ‚Äì ) were married 22 October 1494. The couple had ten children: * John Seymour (died 15 July 1510) * Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of Edward VI (/1506 ‚Äì 22 January 1552) married firstly Catherine, daughter of Sir William Fillol, and secondly Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Stanhope. * Sir Henry Seymour (1503 ‚Äì 1578) married Barbara, daughter of Morgan Wolfe * Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley ( ‚Äì 20 March 1549) married Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII * John Seymour (died young) * Anthony Seymour (died ) * Jane Seymour, queen Consort of Henry VIII ( ‚Äì 24 October 1537) * Margery Seymour (died ) * Elizabeth Seymour ( ‚Äì 19 Mar 1568) * Dorothy Seymour ( ‚Äì ) married firstly, Sir Clement Smith ( ‚Äì 26 August 1552) of Little Baddow, Essex and secondly, Thomas Leventhorpe of Shingle Hall,Shingle Hall is also listed as Shingey, Shingley and Shinglehall in various sources.

Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth were courtiers. Edward and Thomas were both executed during the reign of Edward VI. Henry Seymour, who did not share his brothers' ambition, escaped their fate. Early life Elizabeth Seymour was probably born at Wulfhall around 1518. Her letters to Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII show that she was both intelligent and astute. She was also skilled in needlework. She played a brief but prominent role in the 1530s and 1540s, during the rise to power of her father-in-law, Thomas Cromwell, and her brother, Edward. Elizabeth and her sister, Jane, served in the household of Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn, their second cousin. She married three times and by her first two marriages had seven children. She is best known as the wife of Gregory Cromwell. First marriage Mont Orgueil Castle, Jersey By July 1530, Elizabeth had married, as his second wife, Sir Anthony Ughtred, of Kexby, Yorkshire. The couple had two children: * Sir Henry Ughtred, ( ‚Äì 1599), born at Mont Orgueil, Jersey, married Elizabeth, daughter to John Paulet, Lord St. John and his first wife Elizabeth Willoughby and the widow of Sir William Courtenay. After his wife's death in 1576, Henry remarried, however the identity of his second wife is not recorded. * Margery Ughtred, () married William Hungate of Burnby, Yorkshire. In January 1531, Henry VIII granted the couple the manors of Lepington and Kexby (Yorkshire), previously held by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. She was well-placed at court, in the service of Anne Boleyn, to support her husband's interests. In August 1532, when the pro-Boleyn Sir Anthony Ughtred was appointed captain and Governor of Jersey, it was almost certainly due to the influence of Anne Boleyn. He served in person, and remained in the post until his death. Sir Anthony Ughtred died 6 October 1534 in Jersey, and was buried in the chapel of St George, in the castle of Mont Orgueil. After her husband's death, Elizabeth returned to Kexby, Yorkshire where her daughter, Margery was probably born. Her one-year- old son, Henry, remained on the island for a time, in the care of Helier de Carteret, Bailiff of Jersey. The Queen's sister Anne Boleyn, portrait at Hever Castle When Anne Boleyn failed to produce a male heir after almost three years of marriage, the able and ambitious Edward Seymour and his family, gained wealth and power as Jane supplanted Anne in the king's affections. In March 1536, Edward was made a gentleman of the privy chamber, and a few days later, he and his wife Anne together with his sister Jane, were lodged at the palace at Greenwich in apartments which the king could reach through a private passage. In May 1536, accused of treason, incest and plotting the king's death, Anne was imprisoned in the Tower, awaiting her trial. Jane Seymour resided with members of her family, first at the home of Sir Nicholas Carew in Surrey and then moved closer to the king, to a house at Chelsea, formerly owned by Thomas More. While the king's second wife prepared for her execution, Jane was planning her wedding, \\"splendidly served by the King's cook and other officers\\" and \\"most richly dressed\\". On 30 May 1536, eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry VIII and Jane were married. On 5 June, a week after his sister's marriage to the king, Edward Seymour was created Viscount Beauchamp. Two days later he received a grant of numerous manors in Wiltshire, including Ambresbury, Easton Priory, Chippenham, and Maiden Bradley. On 7 July he was made governor and captain of Jersey, and in August, chancellor of North Wales. He had livery of his father's lands in the following year, was on 30 January granted the manor of Muchelney, Somerset, and on 22 May sworn of the privy council. In the same month he was on the commission appointed to try Lords Darcy and Hussey for their role in the pilgrimage of grace. On 15 October he carried Princess Elizabeth at Edward VI's christening, and 18 October was created Earl of Hertford. Thomas Seymour was also made a gentleman of the privy chamber in 1536, and knighted 18 October of the same year. He was made captain of the Sweepstake in 1537.Jane Seymour, Queen of England, Hans Holbein the younger When Henry VIII sought to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Jane, who had previously served in Catherine's household, had remained loyal to her and her daughter, Mary. Elizabeth and her first husband, Sir Anthony Ughtred had supported Anne Boleyn and benefited from her rise. It is not surprising therefore, that she was not included in the new queen's household. There is no evidence that Elizabeth benefited directly from her sister's royal status, before the news of a royal pregnancy became public knowledge in 1537. The impending birth of an heir to the throne would dramatically increase her value as a potential bride. On 18 March 1537, then a young widow of reduced means, residing in York, Elizabeth had written to Thomas Cromwell, then Baron Cromwell, who had previously offered to help her, if she was ever in need. She had hoped to \\"be holpen to obtain of the king's grace to be farmer of one of these abbeys if they fortune to go down ...\\" Cromwell, probably encouraged by Edward Seymour, proposed instead that she marry his only son and heir, Gregory. By June, it appears that Cromwell's offer had been accepted. Arthur Darcy, the son of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy, assured her that \\"I would have been glad to have had you likewise, but sure it is, as I said, that some southern lord shall make you forget the North.\\" Second marriage Gregory Cromwell, circa 1535‚Äì1540, Hans Holbein the Younger On 3 August 1537, Elizabeth married Gregory Cromwell at Mortlake. Edward Seymour, then Viscount Beauchamp wrote to Cromwell on 2 September 1537, to know how he has fared since the writer's departure. Wishes Cromwell were with him, when he should have had the best sport with bow, hounds, and hawks and sends commendations to his brother-in- law and sister, adding: \\"and I pray God to send me by them shortly a nephew.\\" The couple had five children: * Henry Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell, (before 1 March 1538 ‚Äì 16 December 1592), married Mary, (died 1592), the daughter of John Paulet, Lord St. John and his first wife Elizabeth Willoughby. * Edward Cromwell, (1539 ‚Äì ?) died young * Thomas Cromwell, ( ‚Äì died between February 1610 and April 1611), married 18 August 1580, Katherine (died before 1 August 1616), daughter of Thomas Gardner of Coxford. * Katherine Cromwell, ( ‚Äì ?), probably named after Queen Catherine Howard, married John Strode of Parnham, Dorset * Frances Cromwell, ( ‚Äì 7 February 1562), married Richard Strode of Newnham, Devon. Portrait Miniature of Anne of Cleves, Hans Holbein the Younger On 12 November, three months after their wedding, Elizabeth and Gregory took part in the queen's funeral procession. Jane's death on 24 October, after being delivered of the king's longed-for son, naturally came as a blow to the Seymour family. It proved to be a setback to Edward Seymour's influence. He was described in the following year as \\"young and wise,\\" but \\"of small power\\". The death of the queen would have disastrous consequences for Thomas Cromwell. The couple's first child, Henry was born in 1538, shortly before their arrival at Lewes Priory in Sussex, recently acquired by Thomas Cromwell, where they resided until early 1539. Another son, Edward, followed in 1539, who may have been born, at Leeds Castle in Kent.Thomas Cromwell was the constable of Leeds Castle from January 1539 to 1540 Gregory Cromwell was elected to the House of Commons as one of the knights of the shire for Kent, and summoned to Parliament in April 1539. Gregory Cromwell appears to have been devoted to his wife and children. In December 1539, while in Calais waiting to welcome Henry VIII's new bride, Anne of Cleves, he wrote to his wife at Leeds Castle, addressing her as his \\"loving bedfellow\\", describing the arrival of Anne of Cleves, and requesting news \\"as well of yourself as also my little boys, of whose increase and towardness be you assured I am not a little desirous to be advertised\\". In January 1540, Elizabeth was appointed to the household of the new Queen, Anne of Cleves. Thomas Cromwell was created Earl of Essex on 17 April, and his son, Gregory assumed the courtesy title of Lord Cromwell In May, Lady Cromwell watched her husband compete in the May Day jousts at the Palace of Westminster and afterwards feasted with the queen and her ladies. Anne of Cleves would not remain as queen for long, however, as the mercurial Henry VIII wanted a divorce. Portrait of Thomas Cromwell, wearing the Garter collar (-1540) Thomas Cromwell was at the height of his ascendancy, however his political enemies were gaining ground and his time in power would soon come to an end. He was arrested at a council meeting at 3.00 p.m. on the afternoon of 10 June 1540, accused of treason and heresy, taken to the Tower and his possessions seized. He was condemned without a trial and his sentence was later confirmed by an act of attainder. There are no surviving records of Gregory and Elizabeth's whereabouts at this time. Thomas Cromwell wrote a desperate letter from the tower to the king to plead his innocence and appealed to him to be merciful to his son and the rest of his family. In July, Elizabeth also wrote to Henry VIII, to assure him of her loyalty and that of her husband: Catherine Howard, miniature by Hans Holbein the Younger This undated letter is placed at the end of July 1540 in Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII. It was probably written while Thomas Cromwell was imprisoned in the Tower, as Elizabeth refers to her father-in-law, and not her late father-in-law. Moreover, it was customary at that time to write \\"may his soul God pardon\\" or something similar when referring to someone who had recently died, which she did not do.See , the widow, Lady Ughtred's first letter to Thomas Cromwell; , Lady Berkeley's letter to Thomas Cromwell after the death of her husband, Thomas Berkeley, 6th Baron Berkeley; and , Lady Rochford's letter to Thomas Cromwell after the execution of her husband George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford. The letter was almost certainly written on the advice of her brother, Edward. Thomas Cromwell was beheaded on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540, the same day as the king's marriage to Catherine Howard. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. It is unknown if Gregory and his family were present at his execution or burial. Gregory and Elizabeth were not implicated, although it would be almost six months before their desperate situation was to be resolved. They had been dependants of Thomas Cromwell, with no home and little income of their own, and would have had to rely on the generosity of family and friends. The king was inclined to be generous and Elizabeth was included in the future queen Catherine Howard's household as one of her attendant ladies. On 18 December 1540, less than five months after his father's execution, Gregory Cromwell was created Baron Cromwell by letters patent, and summoned to Parliament as a peer of the realm. This title was a new creation, rather than a restoration of his father's forfeited barony. The following February he received a royal grant of lands that had been owned by his late father. Following the death of Henry VIII in 1547, Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley secretly married the late king's widow, Catherine Parr, who died a few days after giving birth to her only child Mary Seymour, in September 1548. Launde Abbey Chapel, Leicestershire At the coronation of King Edward VI, on 20 February 1547, Elizabeth's husband and her brother, Henry were invested as Knights of the Order of the Bath.‚Äì Her brother, Thomas was found guilty of treason and executed 20 March 1549. Elizabeth became a widow again upon the death of Gregory Cromwell from sweating sickness in 1551. He died at Launde Abbey 4 July 1551 and was buried three days later in the chapel at Launde. In London, Henry Machyn recorded the events in his diary: Gregory lies buried under a magnificent monument in the chapel at Launde. The initials \\"E C\\" can be seen in the intricate entablature beneath the pediment. Edward, Duke of Somerset, who had always been a constant source of support to his sister, Elizabeth, went to the block 22 January 1552 and his wife, remained in the Tower. Since he had been found guilty of the lesser charge of felony, and not for treason, his lands and dignities were not thereby affected, however an act of parliament was passed on 12 April 1552 declaring them forfeited and confirming his attainder. In May, his youngest four daughters were placed in Elizabeth's care. She was granted 100 marks for the provision and education of each of her nieces per year, as well as the lease of her minor son's house of Launde Abbey, by way of an inducement. However, by October, the arrangement was placing the widow under a considerable strain. On 25 October 1552, she wrote to her friend, Sir William Cecil, of the Privy Council, requesting to be relieved of her troublesome nieces, who did not take her advice \\"in such good part as my good meaning was, nor according to my expectation in them\\". Her husband's family were all dead, her own surviving family did not live nearby, and she no longer had the support of her husband or her brother, Edward. She reminded Cecil that she had no near relations who could give her advice. Her pleas fell on deaf ears and her nieces would remain with her until their mother, Anne, Duchess of Somerset, was released from the Tower by Mary I in August 1553. Third marriage Church of St Mary, Old Basing, HampshireBetween 10 March and 24 April 1554, Elizabeth married, as his second wife, Sir John Paulet, later Lord St. John, who outlived her. There were no children by this marriage. Elizabeth's two eldest sons married John Paulet's daughters. Henry Ughtred married the widowed Elizabeth after 1557 and Henry Cromwell married Mary sometime before 1560. Details of her later life remain obscure, however she and her husband appear in the records from time to time in matters relating to her son, Henry Cromwell's minority and suits for the continuation of royal grants at the commencement of each new reign. Death Elizabeth died 19 March 1568, and was buried 5 April in St. Mary's Church, Basing, Hampshire. John Paulet, Lord St. John married, before 30 September 1568, Winifred, widow of Sir Richard Sackville, and daughter of John Brydges, a former Lord Mayor of London. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Winchester in 1572. Portraits Unknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard, perhaps Elizabeth Seymour, after Hans Holbein the Younger. In 1909 Sir Lionel Cust identified a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger as a likeness of Catherine Howard. Inscribed ETATIS SVAE 21, indicating that the sitter was aged twenty-one, the portrait has long been associated with Henry VIII's young queen, however the identification of the portrait as Catherine Howard has been discounted. Historians Antonia Fraser and Derek Wilson believe that the portrait is far more likely to depict Elizabeth Seymour. Antonia Fraser has argued that the sitter is Jane Seymour's sister, Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, on the grounds that the lady bears a resemblance to Jane, especially around the nose and chin, and wears widow's black. Black clothing, however, was expensive, and did not necessarily signify mourning: it was an indication of wealth and status. Derek Wilson observed that \\"In August 1537 Cromwell succeeded in marrying his son, Gregory, to Elizabeth Seymour\\", the queen's younger sister. He was therefore related by marriage to the king, \\"an event worth recording for posterity, by a portrait of his daughter-in-law\\". Herbert Norris notes that the sitter is wearing a sleeve which follows a style set by Anne of Cleves, which would date the portrait to after 6 January 1540, when Anne's marriage to Henry VIII took place. Anne of Cleves was queen consort from 6 January ‚Äì 9 July 1540. Until 1752, the year commenced on Lady Day, 25 March. The portrait shown on this page, attributed to Hans Holbein, dated circa 1535‚Äì1540, is exhibited at the Toledo Museum of Art as Portrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family (1926.57). \\"The painting belonged to the Cromwells for centuries, so she was probably a member of that prominent family. It has been suggested that she may be Elizabeth Seymour, daughter-in-law of Henry‚Äôs powerful government minister Thomas Cromwell and sister of Henry‚Äôs third wife, Jane Seymour.\\" Another version of the portrait, now located at Hever Castle, dating from the sixteenth century, is exhibited as Queen Catherine Howard. The National Portrait Gallery exhibits a similar painting, Unknown Woman, Formerly Known as Catherine Howard (NPG 1119), \\"This portrait was previously identified as Catherine Howard, fifth wife of Henry VIII. The sitter is now thought to be a member of the Cromwell family, perhaps Elizabeth Seymour (c.1518‚Äì1568), sister of Henry VIII‚Äôs third wife, Jane Seymour, and wife of Thomas Cromwell‚Äôs son Gregory.\\" which has been dated to the late seventeenth century.

He has said that as a teenager, he was briefly infatuated with the works of Ayn Rand, though her \\"contempt[] toward most of humanity\\" soon turned him away. In 1975, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College, where he was a member of the varsity squash team and the Harvard Lampoon. In 1978, Sunstein received a J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was executive editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review and part of a winning team of the Ames Moot Court Competition. He served as a law clerk first for Justice Benjamin Kaplan of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (1978‚Äì1979) and later for Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court (1979‚Äì1980).Cass R. Sunstein : Curriculum Vitae Career Sunstein joined the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department as an attorney-advisor (1980‚Äì1981) and then took a job as an assistant professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School (1981‚Äì1983), where he also became an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science (1983‚Äì1985). In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \\"distinguished service\\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. Sunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at Columbia Law School in the fall of 1986 and a visiting professor at Harvard Law School in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in constitutional law, administrative law, and environmental law, as well as the required first-year course \\"Elements of the Law\\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, legal theory, and the interdisciplinary study of law, including law and economics.

On January 7, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Sunstein would be named to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars and environmentalists.https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new- regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/ Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views. On September 9, 2009, the Senate voted for cloture on Sunstein's nomination as Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. The motion passed in a 63‚Äì35 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57‚Äì40 vote. In his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with Timur Kuran, the concept of availability cascades, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance. Sunstein's books include After the Rights Revolution (1990), The Partial Constitution (1993), Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech (1993), Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict (1996), Free Markets and Social Justice (1997), One Case at a Time (1999), Risk and Reason (2002), Why Societies Need Dissent (2003), Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle (2005), Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America (2005), Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary (2005), Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge (2006), and, co-authored with Richard Thaler, Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness (2008). Sunstein's 2006 book, Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge, explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of prediction markets, open- source software, and wikis. Sunstein's 2004 book, The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever, advocates the Second Bill of Rights proposed by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, Republic.com, argued that the Internet may weaken democracy because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as cyberbalkanization. Sunstein co-authored Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago. Nudge discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that > People often make poor choices ‚Äì and look back at them with bafflement! We > do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of > routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing > blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit > cards, happiness, and even the planet itself. The ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and the British Conservative Party in general. The \\"Nudge\\" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King's Fund, has said: > We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such > as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and > don't help people make long-term behavior changes. Contributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He cited the concepts of self- government and equal dignity of human beings, but focused in particular on stories: \\"an emphasis on what happened before and after the firing shots in Concord and the courageous response of the embattled farmers maintains continuity with the historical facts and offers us something on which we can build.\\" Sunstein is a contributing editor to The New Republic and The American Prospect and is a frequent witness before congressional committees. He played an active role in opposing the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998. In recent years, Sunstein has been a guest writer on The Volokh Conspiracy blog as well as the blogs of law professors Lawrence Lessig (Harvard) and Jack Balkin (Yale). He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication The Green Bag coined the concept of a \\"Sunstein number\\" reflecting degrees of separation between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the Erd≈ës numbers sometimes assigned to mathematician authors. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1992) and the American Law Institute (since 1990). He received an Honorary Doctorate from Copenhagen Business School. Views =Legal philosophy= Sunstein is a proponent of judicial minimalism, arguing that judges should focus primarily on deciding the case at hand, and avoid making sweeping changes to the law or decisions that have broad-reaching effects. Some view him as liberal, despite Sunstein's public support for George W. Bush's judicial nominees Michael W. McConnell and John G. Roberts, as well as providing strongly maintained theoretical support for the death penalty. Conservative libertarian legal scholar Richard A. Epstein described Sunstein as \\"one of the more conservative players in the Obama administration.\\" Much of his work also brings behavioral economics to bear on law, suggesting that the \\"rational actor\\" model will sometimes produce an inadequate understanding of how people will respond to legal intervention. Sunstein has collaborated with academics who have training in behavioral economics, most notably Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Christine M. Jolls, to show how the theoretical assumptions of law and economics should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. According to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him. \\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\\" argued Sunstein. Sunstein (along with his coauthor Richard Thaler) has elaborated the theory of libertarian paternalism. In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \\"choice architect.\\" =Military commissions= In 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \\"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\\" and that \\"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\\" Sunstein scorned as \\"ludicrous\\" an argument from law professor George P. Fletcher, who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis. In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in a 5‚Äì3 vote. =First Amendment= In his book Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate First Amendment law. He thinks that the current formulation, based on Justice Holmes' conception of free speech as a marketplace \\"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\\"Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech, The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e The purpose of this reformulation would be to \\"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\\"Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech, p. 119 He is concerned by the present \\"situation in which like-minded people speak or listen mostly to one another,\\"Cass Sunstein, Republic.com 2.0 (Princeton University Press, 2007), p. xii and thinks that in \\"light of astonishing economic and technological changes, we must doubt whether, as interpreted, the constitutional guarantee of free speech is adequately serving democratic goals.\\"Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech, p. xi He proposes a \\"New Deal for speech [that] would draw on Justice Brandeis' insistence on the role of free speech in promoting political deliberation and citizenship.\\" = Animal rights = Some of Sunstein's work has addressed the question of animal rights, as he co- authored a book dealing with the subject, has written papers on it, and was an invited speaker at \\"Facing Animals,\\" an event at Harvard University described as \\"a groundbreaking panel on animals in ethics and the law.\\"Facing Animals May 9, 2007 speech at Harvard from Google video \\"Every reasonable person believes in animal rights,\\" he says, continuing that \\"we might conclude that certain practices cannot be defended and should not be allowed to continue, if, in practice, mere regulation will inevitably be insufficient ‚Äì and if, in practice, mere regulation will ensure that the level of animal suffering will remain very high.\\", Accessed July 22, 2009 Sunstein's views on animal rights generated controversy when Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On page 11 of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including legal standing for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished. = Taxation = Sunstein has argued, \\"We should celebrate tax day.\\"http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009 Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars: > In what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? > Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it > without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support > of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to > coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we > live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be > no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. > [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights > without placing any burden whatsoever on the public‚Ä¶ There is no liberty > without dependency. Sunstein goes on to say: > If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights > to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] > This is why the overused distinction between \\"negative\\" and \\"positive\\" > rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, > immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of > religion ‚Äì just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food > stamps ‚Äì are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed > to improve collective and individual well-being. = Marriage = In Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness, Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \\"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \\"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\\" He goes on further, \\"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \\"official license scheme.\\" Sunstein addressed the Senate on 11 July 1996 advising against the Defense of Marriage Act. = \\"Conspiracy Theories\\" and government infiltration = Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled \\"Conspiracy Theories,\\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \\"cascades\\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \\"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\\" They go on to propose that, \\"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\\", where they suggest, among other tactics, \\"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\\" They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as \\"extremist groups.\\" The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \\"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\\" However, the authors advocate that each \\"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\\" Sunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \\"nongovernmental officials\\"; they suggest that \\"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\\" further warning that \\"too close a connection will be self- defeating if it is exposed.\\" Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \\"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\\" This position has been criticized by some commentators who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens. Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly responses.David Ray Griffin, Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory.

University of Texas Press, 2014. =COVID-19 pandemic= Sunstein published frequently during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sunstein wrote for Bloomberg Opinion that \\"a lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\\" and that they have \\"an exaggerated sense of their own personal risk\\". He argued that \\"as of now, most people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\\" \\"Unless the disease is contained in the near future, it will induce much more fear, and much more in the way of economic and social dislocation, than is warranted by the actual risk,\\" he wrote. \\"Many people will take precautionary steps (canceling vacations, refusing to fly, avoiding whole nations) even if there is no adequate reason to do that. Those steps can in turn increase economic dislocations, including plummeting stock prices.\\" He referred to this tendency‚Äîprioritizing a lower probability of contracting a particular disease rather than the potentially greater social harms of economic recession‚Äîas \\"probability neglect,\\" a term that he invented. A few weeks later, Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \\"on the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have\\". = Star Wars = In 2016, Sunstein wrote of the Disney film franchise Star Wars that \\"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\\" comparing the importance of the films to the Bible, Santa Claus, and Mickey Mouse. The publication was reviewed in Time magazine, where it was described as \\"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" he writes, \\"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \\"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \\"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\\" is \\"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\\" In an interview with The A.V. Club, Sunstein stated that he felt \\"over the moon about Star Wars.\\" The film franchise, in his view, \\"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\\" and includes many \\"puzzles\\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large: :The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don‚Äôt see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels Sunstein compared Star Wars to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \\"episodes.\\" Personal life In the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard..https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg;=PR15&dq;=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl;=lt&sig;=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1 She is Associate Professor of English at the University of Chicago, specializing in British modernism..http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa- ruddick Their marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter Ellyn is a journalist and photographer. Thereafter, Sunstein dated Martha Nussbaum for almost a decade. Nussbaum is a philosopher, classicist, and professor of law at the University of Chicago. On July 4, 2008, Sunstein married Samantha Power, professor of public policy at Harvard, and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, whom he met when they both worked as campaign advisors to Barack Obama. The wedding took place in the Church of Mary Immaculate, in Loher Ireland. They have two children: a son, Declan Power Sunstein (April 24, 2009). and a daughter, R√≠an Power Sunstein (June 1, 2012). Sunstein is an avid amateur squash player who has played against professionals in PSA tournaments and in 2017 was ranked 449th in the world by the Professional Squash Association. Honors In July 2017, Sunstein was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. In 2018 he was awarded the Holberg Prize for having \\"reshaped our understanding of the relationship between the modern regulatory state and constitutional law. He is widely regarded as the leading scholar of administrative law in the U.S., and he is by far the most cited legal scholar in the United States and probably the world.\\" Publications =Books= 1990‚Äì1999    2000‚Äì2009   ::Translation:  (based on the Seeley Lectures 2004 at Cambridge University) ::Translation:   * ::Translation: 2010 onwards      = Journal articles = See also * Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates * Choice architecture * List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States * List of U.S. executive branch 'czars' References External links *It's All Cass Sunstein's Default a 2017 strategy+business magazine \\"creative mind\\" profile.

Nucella lapillus was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Buccinum lapillus (the basionym). \\"Dog whelk\\" can also refer to the Nassariidae. Distribution This species is found around the coasts of Europe and in the northern west Atlantic coast of North America. It also can be found in estuarine waters along the Atlantic coasts. This species prefers rocky shores, where it eats mussels and acorn barnacles.Colin Little, J. A. Kitching, 1996, The Biology of Rocky Shores, pp. 140-145. Shell description Five views of a white shell of Nucella lapillus Colour variability of shells of Nucella lapillus. The dog whelk shell is small and rounded with a pointed spire and a short, straight siphonal canal (a groove on the underside of the shell) and a deep anal canal. The overall shell shape varies quite widely according to the degree of exposure to wave action of the shore on which a particular population lives but the body whorl (the largest section of the shell where the majority of the visceral mass is located) is usually around 3/4 of the total length of the shell.http://staffweb.itsligo.ie/staff/bcrowe/Bill/styles/frames/marbiol/sshorero/rzonffrs.htm The aperture is usually crenulated in mature dog whelks, less often in juveniles. The shell surface can be fairly smooth interrupted only with growth lines, or when the snail is living in more sheltered areas the shell surface can be somewhat rough and lamellose. The surface is spirally corded. The outer lip is dentate and ridged within. The columella is smooth. The external shell colour is usually a whitish grey, but can be a wide variety of orange, yellow, brown, black, or banded with any combination of these colours. They can even, occasionally, be green, blue, or pink. Ecology =Habitat= The dog whelk lives in rocky shores, and estuarine conditions. Climatically it lives between the 0 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C isotherms. = Effects of the habitat = Wave action tends to confine the dog whelk to more sheltered shores, however, this can be counteracted, both by adaptations to tolerate it such as the shell and muscular foot, and by the avoidance of direct exposure to wave action afforded by making use of sheltered microhabitats in rocky crevices. The preferred substrate material of the dog whelk is solid rock and not sand, which adds to its problems at lower levels on the shore where weathering is likely to have reduced the stability of the seabed. Water loss by evaporation has to be tolerated (by means of the operculum which holds water in and prevents its escape as vapour), or avoided (by moving into water or a shaded area). The peak in dog whelk population density is approximately coincidental with the mid-tidal zone. It lives in the middle shore. In general it can be said that at high vertical heights on the shoreline the dog whelk is most threatened by biotic factors such as predation from birds and interspecific competition for food, but abiotic factors are the primary concern, creating a harsh environment in which it is difficult to survive. At low vertical heights it is biotic factors, such as predation from crabs and intraspecific competition, which cause problems. The upper limit of the range in which the dog whelk is generally found is approximately coincidental with the mean high water neap tide line, and the lower limit of the range is approximately coincidental with the mean low water neap tide line, so that the vast majority of dog whelks are found on the mid-tidal zone. Tidal pools and comparable microhabitats extend the vertical range of organisms such as the dog whelk as they provide a more constant environment, but they are prone to increased salinity because evaporation concentrates dissolved substances. This can create toxic conditions for many species. The dog whelk can only survive out of water for a limited period, as it will gradually become desiccated and die if emersed for too long. Metabolic processes within cells take place in solution, and a decrease in water content makes it impossible for the organism to function properly. In experiments it has been shown that 50% of dog whelks die at 40 ¬∞C, and it can be assumed that at temperatures lower than this a smaller proportion will be killed off. Furthermore, the dog whelk has to excrete ammonia directly into water, as it does not have the adaptation possessed by many upper shore species which would allow it to produce uric acid for excretion without loss of water. When kept emersed for seven days at a temperature of 18 ¬∞C, 100% of dog whelks die, in contrast to many periwinkle species which can lose even more water than the dog whelk (i.e. more than 37% of their total body mass) but survive as a result of their ability to excrete toxic waste products more efficiently. = Feeding habits = Its adaptations include a modified radula (a toothed chitinous structure) to bore holes in the shells of prey, complemented by an organ on the foot which secretes a shell- softening chemical. When a hole has been formed paralysing chemicals and digestive enzymes are secreted inside the shell to break the soft body down into a 'soup' which can be sucked out with the proboscis. The plates of barnacles can be pushed apart with the proboscis, and the entire individual is eaten in about a day, although larger animals such as mussels may take up to a week to digest. Feeding only occurs when conditions are conducive to such an activity, and during these times the dog whelk consumes large quantities of food so that the gut is always kept as full as possible. This allows shelter until more food is required, when foraging resumes. If waves are large or there is an excessive risk of water loss the dog whelk will remain inactive in sheltered locations for long periods. Mussels have developed a defensive strategy of tethering and immobilising with byssus threads any dog whelks invading their beds, leading to the whelks' starvation. = Life cycle = { Nucella lapillus snails and their freshly laid egg capsules. Empty egg capsules of Nucella lapillus. } = Predators = Predators of the dog whelk include various species of crabs and birds. Protection against predation from crabs which attempt to pull the soft body out through the shell aperture can be afforded by growing teeth around the edge of the aperture. Many predators cannot smash the strong shell of an adult dog whelk, but juveniles are vulnerable to attack from many predatory species. Eider ducks and various other birds simply swallow the entire body with its shell, while oystercatchers and various crustaceans are often capable of crushing or breaking the shells. In the winter they endure more predation from purple sandpipers and similar wading birds, but in the summer crabs represent a greater threat. In general, the dog whelk can be thought of as being vulnerable to birds when emersed, and to crabs when immersed.  Human use  The dog-whelk can be used to produce red-purple and violet dyes,Whelks and purple dye in Anglo-Saxon England. Carole P. Biggam.

Issue Number 9, March 2006. like its Mediterranean relations the spiny dye-murex Bolinus brandaris, the banded dye-murex Hexaplex trunculus and the rock-shell Stramonita haemastoma which provided the red-purple and violet colours that the Ancient World valued so highly. Bede mentions that in Britain \\"whelks are abundant, and a beautiful scarlet dye is extracted from them which remains unfaded by sunshine or rain; indeed, the older the cloth, the more beautiful its colour.\\"https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede- book1.asp Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People Book 1, Chapter 1. In Ireland, on the island of Inishkea North, Co. Mayo, archaeologists found a whelk-dyeing workshop, dated to the 7th century AD, complete with a small, presumed vat, and a pile of broken-open dog-whelk shells. Unfortunately, no such workshop is known from Britain for the Early Medieval period. However, a double-checked trace of bromine, indicating the presence of whelk-dye, has been found on one page of an Anglo-Saxon book known as the Barberini Gospels. This manuscript dates to the late 8th or early 9th century AD, and the whelk dye occurs as a background panel to white lettering at the beginning of St John's gospel. Efforts have also been made to find whelk dye on surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon textiles, but the chemical analyses so far carried out have proved negative for bromine.Porter, C.A., Chiari, G. and Cavallo, A., 2002.

It is the second installment in The Pink Panther film series, with Peter Sellers reprising his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the French S√ªret√©. Clouseau's blundering personality is unchanged, but it was in this film that Sellers began to give him the idiosyncratically exaggerated French accent that was to later become a hallmark of the character. The film also marks the first appearances of Herbert Lom as his long-suffering boss, Commissioner Dreyfus, as well as Burt Kwouk as his stalwart man servant Cato and Andr√© Maranne as Fran√ßois, all three of whom would become series regulars. Elke Sommer portrays the murder suspect, Maria Gambrelli. The character of Gambrelli would return in Son of the Pink Panther (1993), this time played by Claudia Cardinale, who appeared as Princess Dala in The Pink Panther (1963). Graham Stark, who portrays police officer Hercule Lajoy, would reprise this role eighteen years later, in Trail of the Pink Panther (1982). The film was not originally written to include Clouseau, but was an adaptation of a stage play by Harry Kurnitz adapted from a French play L'Idiote by Marcel Achard.A Shot in the Dark by Marcel Achard and adapted by Harry Kurnitz had a 1961-1962 Broadway run, directed by Harold Clurman. Its cast included Julie Harris, Walter Matthau, and William Shatner. The film was released only a year after the first Clouseau film, The Pink Panther.  Plot  At night in the servants' quarters of a grand house, several men and women are moving about: surreptitiously climbing upstairs and down; entering rooms and leaving; hiding from, and spying on, one another. Then there are gunshots. It is the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders), and Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the S√ªret√©, the French national police, is called there to investigate the murder of the chauffeur, Miguel Ostos, who was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed there and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he is immediately attracted to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high-profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation. Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened early in the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Cato (Burt Kwouk). In order to keep his senses sharp, Clouseau has instructed Cato to attack him when he least expects it. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself. A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges against her. Clouseau's actions embarrass the S√ªret√© in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation. As Clouseau continues to bungle the case, Commissioner Dreyfus becomes increasingly unhinged and suffers a nervous breakdown that reduces him to a delusional psychotic. He stalks Clouseau in order to assassinate him, but accidentally kills a series of innocent bystanders instead and adds further notoriety to the case. When Clouseau confronts the Ballon household in an attempt to trick the murderer into unmasking himself or herself, it is revealed that everybody was involved in the murders‚Äîeach of them has killed at least one of the earlier victims due to crimes of passion and/or subsequent blackmail attempts‚Äîexcept Maria, who is innocent of any crime. Ballon eventually reveals that his wife was attempting to shoot Maria, thinking she would catch the two having an affair, but shot Miguel by accident. Ballon had been hiding in the closet while the shooting occurred and knocked Maria unconscious with the closet door knob, subsequently placing the gun in her hand to protect his wife. As a massive row breaks out among employers and staff, the lights are cut (an arrangement Clouseau had made with his assistant), and the guilty take the opportunity to pile into Clouseau's car and escape. They are all killed when the car is destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by Commissioner Dreyfus in another attempt to kill Clouseau. Witnessing this result, Dreyfus is reduced to an animalistic fury and is taken away by Clouseau's assistant. Finally, Clouseau and Maria celebrate the clearing of her name with a long and passionate kiss‚Äîwhich is swiftly interrupted by another sneak attack by Cato.

Walter Mirisch approached Blake Edwards and asked him to take over as director of A Shot in the Dark from Anatole Litvak. Edwards declined initially, but eventually relented under pressure on the condition he could rewrite the script and substitute Inspector Clouseau for the lead character and choreograph comic scenes on the fly as he and Sellers had successfully done for their previous film.Blake Edwards DVD director's commentary, The Pink Panther (1964), MGM Movie Legends DVD release 2007 The relationship between Edwards and Sellers deteriorated to such a point that at the conclusion of the film they vowed never to work together again. They eventually reconciled to collaborate successfully four years later on The Party, and on three more \\"Pink Panther\\" films in the 1970s. As with most of the other Clouseau films, A Shot in the Dark features an animated opening titles sequence produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises utilizing an animated version of Inspector Clouseau. This film and Inspector Clouseau are the only Clouseau films not to feature the Pink Panther character in the opening titles. Henry Mancini's theme for this film serves as opening theme and incidental music in The Inspector cartoon shorts made by DePatie-Freleng from 1965 to 1969. The title song 'The Shadows of Paris' was written by Henry Mancini. The singer is not credited but contemporary trade reports confirm it was Decca Records recording artist Gina Carroll.  Reception  Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"It is mad, but the wonderful dexterity and the air of perpetually buttressed dignity with which Mr. Sellers plays his role make what could quickly be monotonous enjoyable to the end.\\" Variety wrote: \\"Wisdom remains to be seen of projecting a second appearance of the hilariously inept detective so soon after the still-current firstrun showing of 'Panther,' since some of the spontaneous novelty may have worn off, but the laughs are still there abundantly through imaginative bits of business and a few strike belly proportions.\\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"is all variations of falling down and going boom ... I won't say 'ad nauseum' because Sellers is a clever comedian and never that painful to take. But enough is enough already.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. (July 16, 1964). \\"'Zulu' Carries On in 'Geste' Tradition\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 13. Richard L.

Biography He was born in Basel. His father, Christian Frederick B√∂cklin (b. 1802), was descended from an old family of Schaffhausen, and engaged in the silk trade. His mother, Ursula Lippe, was a native of the same city. Arnold studied at the D√ºsseldorf academy under Schirmer, and became a friend of Anselm Feuerbach. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. Schirmer, who recognized in him a student of exceptional promise, sent him to Antwerp and Brussels, where he copied the works of Flemish and Dutch masters. B√∂cklin then went to Paris, worked at the Louvre, and painted several landscapes. After serving his time in the army, B√∂cklin set out for Rome in March 1850. The many sights of Rome were a fresh stimulus to his mind. These new influences brought allegorical and mythological figures into his compositions. In 1856 he returned to Munich, and remained there for four years. His first fianc√© died young. A second woman declined to marry. In Rome, he married Angela Rosa Lorenza Pascucci in 1853. The couple had fourteen children, but five died in childhood and another three died before B√∂cklin. He himself nearly succumbed to typhoid in 1859.https://www.theartstory.org/artist/bocklin-arnold/life-and-legacy/ Career Roger Freeing Angelica, 1873 He then exhibited the Great Park, one of his earliest works, in which he treated ancient mythology. Of this period are his Nymph and Satyr, Heroic Landscape (Diana Hunting), both of 1858, and Sappho (1859). These works, which were much discussed, together with Lenbach's recommendation, gained him appointment as professor at the Weimar academy. He held the office for two years, painting the Venus and Love, a Portrait of Lenbach, and a Saint Catherine. He returned to Rome from 1862 to 1866, and there gave his fancy and his taste for violent colour free play in his Portrait of Mme B√∂cklin, and in An Anchorite in the Wilderness (1863), a Roman Tavern, and Villa on the Seashore (1864). He returned to Basel in 1866 to finish his frescoes in the gallery, and to paint, besides several portraits, The Magdalene with Christ (1868), Anacreon's Muse (1869), and A Castle and Warriors (1871). His Portrait of Myself, with Death playing a violin (1872), was painted after his return again to Munich, where he exhibited Battle of the Centaurs, Landscape with Moorish Horsemen and A Farm (1875). From 1876 to 1885 B√∂cklin was working at Florence, and painted a Piet√†, Ulysses and Calypso, Prometheus, and the Sacred Grove. From 1886 to 1892 he settled at Z√ºrich, after which he resided at San Domenico, near Florence. From this period are the Naiads at Play, A Sea Idyll, and War. Grave of Arnold Bocklin, Cimitero degli Allori, Florence, Italy B√∂cklin died on 16 January 1901 in Fiesole. He is buried in the Cimitero degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Italy. Symbolism Villa by the Sea Influenced by Romanticism, B√∂cklin's symbolist use of imagery derived from mythology and legend often overlapped with the aesthetic of the Pre-Raphaelites. Many of his paintings are imaginative interpretations of the classical world, or portray mythological subjects in settings involving classical architecture, often allegorically exploring death and mortality in the context of a strange, fantasy world. B√∂cklin is best known for his five versions (painted 1880 to 1886) of the Isle of the Dead, which partly evokes the English Cemetery, Florence, which was close to his studio and where his baby daughter Maria had been buried. An early version of the painting was commissioned by a Madame Berna, a widow who wanted a painting with a dreamlike atmosphere.Burroughs, Bryson. \\"The Island of the Dead by Arnold B√∂cklin.\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Vol. 21, No. 6 (Jun., 1926), pp. 146‚Äì148. Clement Greenberg wrote in 1947 that B√∂cklin's work \\"is one of the most consummate expressions of all that is now disliked about the latter half of the nineteenth century.\\"Greenberg, Clement. Nation. 3/22/1947, Vol. 164 Issue 12, p340‚Äì342. Legacy Isle of the Dead (\\"Die Toteninsel\\") The Island of Life (Die Lebensinsel), 1888 B√∂cklin influenced Giorgio de Chirico,Holzhey, Magdalena (2005). Giorgio de Chirico, 1888‚Äì1978: the Modern Myth. K√∂ln: Taschen. p. 11. . who said \\"Each of B√∂cklin's works is a shock\\", and other Surrealist painters like Max Ernst and Salvador Dal√≠. When asked who was his favorite painter, Marcel Duchamp controversially named Arnold B√∂cklin as having a major influence on his art. Whether Duchamp was serious in this assertion is still debated. H. R. Giger has created a picture called Homage to Boecklin, based upon Isle of the Dead. Several of his works are part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel and exhibited there. There is currently also a room in the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich dedicated to his work. =In music= B√∂cklin's paintings, especially Isle of the Dead, inspired several late-Romantic composers. * Gustav Mahler's song Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt (St. Anthony's Sermon to the Fish) from his Des Knaben Wunderhorn song cycle, which also appears as the Scherzo movement in Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (Mahler) was inspired by B√∂cklin's 1892 painting, St. Anthony Preaching to the Fish. *In 1891, Portuguese pianist Jos√© Vianna da Motta composed two pieces on B√∂cklin's paintings Meeresidylle and Im Spiel der Wellen. * Sergei Rachmaninoff (see Isle of the Dead) and Heinrich Schulz-Beuthen both composed symphonic poems after it. Rachmaninoff was also inspired by B√∂cklin's painting Die Heimkehr (\\"The Homecoming\\" or \\"The Return\\") when writing his Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10.Jonathan Yungkans: Liner notes to the complete Benno Moiseiwitsch Rachmaninoff recordings 1937‚Äì43 Ates Orga: Liner notes to Demidenko plays Rachmaninov * Andreas Hall√©n, a Swedish Romantic composer, wrote a symphonic poem Die Toteninsel in 1898. * In 1913 Max Reger composed a set of Four Tone Poems after B√∂cklin with the movements \\"Der geigende Eremit\\", \\"Im Spiel der Wellen\\", \\"Die Toteninsel\\", and \\"Bacchanal\\". * In Mark Robson's film Isle of the Dead (1945), Disney composer Leigh Harline's somber score makes use of Sergei Rachmaninoff's music. * Hans Huber's second symphony is entitled B√∂cklin-Sinfonie, after the artist and his paintings. * Felix Woyrsch composed 3 B√∂cklin Phantasies (Die Toteninsel, Der Eremit, Im Spiel der Wellen), Op. 53 (1910). =Other= Otto Weisert designed an Art Nouveau typeface in 1904 and named it \\"Arnold B√∂cklin\\" in his honor. Adolf Hitler was fond of B√∂cklin's work, at one time owning 11 of his paintings.Vinocur, John. \\"The Burlesque, and Rigor, of Arnold B√∂cklin.\\" New York Times. 12 January 2002.

The clade is the most diverse and ecologically successful of the gastropods. Caenogastropoda contains many families of shelled marine molluscs ‚Äì including the periwinkles, cowries, wentletraps, moon snails, murexes, cone snails and turrids ‚Äì and constitutes about 60% of all living gastropods..  Biology  The Caenogastropoda exhibit torsion, and thus are included in what was previously called the Streptoneura (meaning twisted nerves), also known as Prosobranchia (meaning gills forward). Specifically, they are characterized by having only a single auricle in the heart and a single pair of gill leaflets, and are equivalent to the Monotocardia or Pectinobranchia of older authors.

The taxon Caenogastropoda was first established by Leslie Reginald Cox in 1960 as a superorderCaenogastropoda, Paleobiology but now sometimes it is retained as a clade. Based on optimal phylogenetic analysis, it is deemed monophyletic. This Caenogastropoda combines the older taxa Mesogastropoda and Stenoglossa from the classification by Johannes Thiele and is equivalent to the revised Monotocardia as defined by M√∂rch in 1865. Caenogastropoda can be divided into two major groups, based on the anatomy of the radula: * Taenioglossa (from taenio meaning band), equivalent to the older Mesogastropoda, with typically seven teeth in each radular row. * Stenoglossa (from steno meaning narrow), the Neogastropoda, with only 1‚Äì3 teeth per row. = 1997 taxonomy = Ponder & Lindberg, 1997 and others since (e.g. Vega et al., 2006;F.

It first appeared weekly, then daily from 8 February 1923. For twenty-four years it formed part of the official public face of the Nazi Party until its last edition at the end of April 1945. The paper was banned and ceased publication between November 1923, after Adolf Hitler's arrest for leading the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, and February 1925, the approximate time of the rally which relaunched the NSDAP. Overview =Origins= The \\"fighting paper of the National Socialist movement of Greater Germany\\", or \\"Kampfblatt der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung Gro√üdeutschlands\\" as it called itself, had its origin as the M√ºnchener Beobachter, or Munich Observer, an anti-Semitic semi-weekly scandal-oriented paper which in 1918 was acquired by the Thule Society and, in August 1919, was renamed V√∂lkischer Beobachter. =Acquisition by the NSDAP= By December 1920, the paper was heavily in debt. The Thule Society was thus receptive to an offer to sell the paper to the Nazis for 60,000 Papiermark. Major Ernst R√∂hm, who had joined the German Workers' Party, forerunner of the Nazi Party, before Adolf Hitler did, and Dietrich Eckart, one of Hitler's earliest mentors, persuaded R√∂hm‚Äôs commanding officer, Major General Franz Ritter von Epp, to purchase the paper for the NSDAP. It was never definitively established where Epp got the money, but it almost certainly came from secret army funds. This would suggest an early link between the army and right-wing radicals like the Nazis. After the Nazis acquired the paper, Eckart became the first editor. =Acquisition by Hitler= In 1921, Adolf Hitler, who had taken full control of the NSDAP earlier that year, acquired all shares in the company, making him the sole owner of the publication. =Circulation= The circulation of the paper was initially about 8,000, but it increased to 25,000 in autumn 1923 due to strong demand during the occupation of the Ruhr. In that year Alfred Rosenberg became editor.Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p34 Production ceased on the prohibition of the NSDAP after the Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923, but it resumed on the party's refoundation on 26 February 1925. The circulation rose along with the success of the Nazi movement, reaching more than 120,000 in 1931 and 1.7 million by 1944. =As a propaganda instrument= During the rise to power, it reported general news but also party activities, presenting them as almost constant success. Guidelines for propagandists urged that all posters, insofar as the police allowed, contain propaganda for it, and all meetings should be announced in it, although reports should be sent to the Propaganda Department, which would then forward corrected versions to the paper. Posters did indeed urge reading it.Early Nazi Posters When Hitler was banned from public speaking, it was the main vehicle to propagate his views.Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p. 51 Joseph Goebbels published articles in it to attack the United States for criticizing anti-Jewish measures, and to describe Russia.

With about 1,600 living species, the Muricidae represent almost 10% of the Neogastropoda. Additionally, 1,200 fossil species have been recognized.Merle, D., Garrigues, B. & Pointier, J.-P. (2011). Fossil and Recent Muricidae of the World, Part Muricinae. 648 pp., 182 colour plates, ConchBooks, Hackenheim. . Numerous subfamilies are recognized, although experts disagree about the subfamily divisions and the definitions of the genera. Many muricids have unusual shells which are considered attractive by shell collectors and by interior designers. Shell description Muricid shells are variably shaped, generally with a raised spire and strong sculpture with spiral ridges and often axial varices (typically three or more varices on each whorl), also frequently bearing spines, tubercles, or blade-like processes. Periostracum is absent in this family. The aperture is variable in shape; it may be ovate to more or less contracted, with a well-marked anterior siphonal canal that may be very long. The shell's outer lip is often denticulated inside, sometimes with a tooth-like process on its margin. The columella is smoothish to weakly ridged. The operculum is corneous and of variable thickness, with the nucleus near the anterior end or at about midlength of the outer margin. Many muricids have episodic growth, which means their shells grow in spurts, remaining the same size for a while (during which time the varix develops) before rapidly growing to the next size stage. The result is the series of above mentioned varices on each whorl. A mass of muricid egg capsules in a tidepool in 200px Life habits Most species of muricids are carnivorous, active predators that feed on other gastropods, bivalves, and barnacles. The access to the soft parts of the prey is typically obtained by boring a hole through the shell by means of a softening secretion and the scraping action of the radula. Because of their carnivory, some species may be considered pests because they can cause considerable destruction both in exploited natural beds of bivalves, and in farmed areas of commercial bivalves. Muricids lay eggs in protective, corneous capsules, the size and shape of which vary by species. From these capsules the crawling juveniles, or more rarely planktonic larvae, hatch. Historical value Members of the family were harvested by early Mediterranean peoples, with the Phoenicians possibly the first to do so, to extract an expensive, vivid, stable dye known as Tyrian purple, imperial purple, or royal purple. The fossil record The family Muricidae first appears in the fossil record during the Aptian age of the Cretaceous period.

In 1947, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 October, the anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations, as which \\"shall be devoted to making known to the people of the world the aims and achievements of the United Nations and to gaining their support for\\" its work. In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a further resolution (United Nations Resolution 2782) declaring that United Nations Day shall be an international observance or international holiday and recommended that it should be observed as a public holiday by United Nations member states. World War II Allies' day The first event called \\"United Nations Day\\" was a World War II Allies' day of solidarity and military parades launched by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt tied to US Flag Day on June 14, 1942, six months after the Declaration by United Nations. It was observed in New York City as the \\"New York at War\\" parade, in London, and by the Soviet and Chinese governments. It was observed throughout World War II, during 1942‚Äì1944. Prior to the foundation of the UN itself, it was not directly connected to the current international observance. Commemoration U.N. Day has traditionally been marked throughout the world with meetings, discussions and exhibits about the achievements and goals of the organization. In 1971, the General Assembly recommended that member states observe it as a public holiday. Several international schools throughout India and other countries throughout the world would also celebrate the diversity of their student body on United Nations Day (although the event is not necessarily celebrated on 24 October). Celebrations often include a show of cultural performances in the evening and a food fair, where food is available from all over the world. In the United States, the President has issued a proclamation each year for United Nations Day since 1948. In Kosovo, United Nations Day is an official non-working day, as the province is administered by the Interim Administration Mission. In the Philippines, local schoolchildren customarily dress in the national costumes of member states and hold a programme on U.N. Day, which is the last school day before semestral break. Individual students, classes, or grade levels are assigned a country to represent and study; students handcraft their assigned country's flag, and prepare cultural presentations and food as part of the day's educational activities.  History Commemorations  On United Nations Day in 1951, the United Nations Postal Administration issued the first UN Stamps, which were issued in U.S. Dollars at the U.N. Headquarters in New York. World Development Information Day The UN's World Development Information Day has also been held on 24 October since 1972 Humanity has entered the era of sustainability ‚Äì with a global commitment to fulfill the great promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is celebrated on 24 October worldwide. Many institutions celebrate it by conducting quizzes and elocutions.

It is a deciduous shrub normally ranging in height from , though sometimes it can scramble higher into the crowns of taller trees. Its stems are covered with small, sharp, hooked prickles, which aid it in climbing. The leaves are pinnate, with 5‚Äì7 leaflets. The flowers are usually pale pink, but can vary between a deep pink and white. They are in diameter with five petals, and mature into an oval, , red-orange fruit, or hip. Synonyms From DNA analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphisms of wild-rose samples from a transect across Europe (900 samples from section Caninae, and 200 from other sections), it has been suggested that the following named species are best considered as part of a single Rosa canina species complex, and are therefore synonyms of R. canina: * R. balsamica Besser * R. caesia Sm. * R. corymbifera Borkh. * R. dumalis Bechst. * R. montana Chaix * R. stylosa Desv. * R. subcanina (Christ) Vuk. * R. subcollina (Christ) Vuk. * R. √ó irregularis D√©s√©gl. & Guillon Cultivation and uses A botanical illustration showing the various stages of growth by Otto Wilhelm Thom√© A tall, climbing Rosa canina shrub Rose hips The flesh (shells) of rose hips from dog roses contain high levels of antioxidants, mainly polyphenols and ascorbic acid, as well as carotenoids and vitamins B and E. Rose hips contain a high amount of carotenoids and ascorbic acid along with natural sugars, organic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolics, and essential oil, making them excellent for consumption. Rose hip essential oil is composed mainly of alcohols, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The fruit is noted for its high level of vitamin C, and is used to make syrup, tea, and marmalade. It has been grown or encouraged in the wild for the production of vitamin C from its fruit (often as rose-hip syrup), especially during conditions of scarcity or during wartime. The species has also been introduced to other temperate latitudes. During World War II in the United States, Rosa canina was planted in victory gardens, and can still be found growing throughout the country, including roadsides and in wet, sandy areas along the coastlines. In Bulgaria, where it grows in abundance, the hips are used to make a sweet wine as well as tea. In the traditional Austrian medicine, Rosa canina fruits have been used internally as tea for treatment of viral infections and disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract. The hips are used as a flavouring in Cockta, a soft drink made in Slovenia. Bao Ninh in \\"The Sorrow of War,\\" his novel of the Vietnam War from a North Vietnamese soldier's perspective, writes: \\"With canina one smoked to forget the daily hell of the soldier's life, smoked to forget hunger and suffering. Also, to forget death. And totally, but totally, to forget tomorrow.\\" Forms of this plant are used as stocks for the grafting or budding of cultivated roses. The wild plant is used for stabilising soil in land reclamation and specialised landscaping schemes. Numerous cultivars have been named, though few are common in cultivation. The cultivar Rosa canina 'Assisiensis' is the only dog rose without thorns. The flower is one of the national symbols of Romania. Medicinal use Medicinal interest in rose hips has increased as a consequence of research that has explored the potential application of rose hips for treatment of several diseases including skin disorders, hepatotoxicity, renal disturbances, diarrhoea, inflammatory disorders, arthritis, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and cancer. In history, residue products from rose hips have been used as animal fodder, but now are being explored and gaining an important role in cosmetics, pharmacology and in food applications as they contain oil with a high degree of unsaturated lipids. An experiment was done in Italy by the Department of Pharmacology at Bologna University, to test the anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective effects of crude extract from the Rosa Canina (dog rose) on a rat. The data showed that Gastric damage was lower in rat stomachs that had been pretreated by the Rosa canina extract and chemical analysis revealed that the extract contributed to having anti-inflammatory effects. It concluded that the anti-inflammatory property of Rosa canina suggested a potential role in the management of inflammatory-related diseases. Culinary use The fruit is used in the making of pies, stews, and wine. The flowers can be made into a syrup, or can be eaten in salads, or candied or preserved in vinegar, honey and brandy. Canina meiosis Rose bedeguar gall on a dog rose The dog roses, the Canina section of the genus Rosa (20-30 species and subspecies, which occur mostly in Northern and Central Europe), have an unusual kind of meiosis that is sometimes called permanent odd polyploidy, although it can occur with even polyploidy (e.g. in tetraploids or hexaploids). Regardless of ploidy level, only seven bivalents are formed leaving the other chromosomes as univalents. Univalents are included in egg cells, but not in pollen. Similar processes occur in some other organisms. Dog roses are most commonly pentaploid, i.e. five times the base number of seven chromosomes for the genus Rosa, but may be tetraploid or hexaploid as well. Name and etymology The botanical name is derived from the common names 'dog rose' or similar in several European languages, including classical Latin and ancient (Hellenistic period) Greek. It is sometimes considered that the word 'dog' has a disparaging meaning in this context, indicating 'worthless' as compared with cultivated garden roses. According to The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the English name is a direct translation of the plant's name from classical Latin, rosa canina, itself a translation of the Greek Œ∫œÖŒΩœåœÅŒøŒ¥ŒøŒΩ ('kun√≥rodon'); the name arose out of the belief in classical times that the root was a cure for the bite of a mad dog. It is known to have been used to treat the bite of rabid dogs in the 18th and 19th centuries.Howard, Michael. Traditional Folk Remedies (Century, 1987); p.133 The origin of its name may be related to the hooked prickles on the plant that have resemblance to a dog's canines. The Roman naturalist Pliny attributed the name dog rose to a belief that the plant's root could cure the bite of a mad dog. It is not clear if the dogs were rabid. Other old folk names include dogberry and witches' briar. Invasive species Dog rose is an invasive species in the high country of New Zealand. It was recognised as displacing native vegetation as early as 1895 although the Department of Conservation does not consider it to be a conservation threat. The dog rose is a declared weed in Australia under the Natural Resources Management Act 2004 (NRM Act) as the plant out-competes native vegetation, provides shelter to pests such as foxes and rabbits, is unpalatable to stock, large shrubs are resistant to grazing, therefore do not get eaten by farm animals. The dog rose also invades native bushland therefore reducing biodiversity and the presence of desirable pasture species. It is also a biosecurity risk as it hosts fruit fly. Birds and wild fruit eating animals are the main cause of seed dispersal. The plant seeds can also be carried in the hooves or fur of stock animals. They may also be carried by waterways. In culture The Thousand-year Rose in Hildesheim The dog rose was the stylised rose of medieval European heraldry.Carol Klein It is the county flower of Hampshire, and Ireland's County Leitrim is nicknamed \\"The Wild Rose County\\" due to the prevalence of the dog rose in the area. Legend states the Thousand-year Rose or Hildesheim Rose, which climbs against a wall of Hildesheim Cathedral, dates back to the establishment of the diocese in 815. The first recorded significance of the flower dates back hundreds of years ago to The Academy of Floral Games (founded in 1323), which gifted poets a sprig of Dog-rose to reward them for their literary excellence. Due to this ritual, the branches became increasingly popular and can be found frequently mentioned in several famous poems. Most prevalent in the United Kingdom, William Shakespeare wrote about the flower in \\"A Mid-Summer Night's Dream\\", which in his time was called eglantine, though it can now also refer to Rosa rubiginosa (Sweet brier) Oberon, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act II, Scene I quoting his words:\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.\\" Symbolically, the meaning of this shrub is quite extensive since the two dominating themes surrounding the flower are pain and pleasure. An old riddle, 'The Five Brethren of the Rose', On a summer's day, in sultry weather Five Brethren were born together Two had beards and two had none And the other had but half a one.\\" The riddle contains an effective way of identifying the differing roses of the canina group, where the brethren' refers to the five sepals of the dog- rose, two of which are whiskered on both sides, two quite smooth and the last one whiskered on one side only.

She was killed in a plane crash at the age of 30. Early life Neveu was born on 11 August 1919 in Paris into a musical family. Her brother Jean-Paul became a classical pianist (and her eventual accompanist) and the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor was their great-uncle. Neveu's mother was her first teacher. Neveu made her solo debut at the age of seven with Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 at the Salle Gaveau in Paris. In the same year she performed Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor with the Colonne Orchestra under Gabriel Piern√©. Her parents then decided to send her to study under Line Talluel. Aged nine, she won first prize at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Musique and the City of Paris Prix d'Honneur. After further studies with Jules Boucherit at the Conservatoire de Paris, she completed her training with instruction from George Enescu (who had been Yehudi Menuhin's teacher), Nadia Boulanger and Carl Flesch. Flesch offered to teach her without charge after hearing her in the Vienna International Violin Competition, at which, aged 12, she was placed fourth out of 250 entrants. The Vienna Neues Tageblatt wrote, \\"If you close your eyes, you think you are listening to the vigorous playing of a man and not that of a little girl in a white frock.\\" Career In 1935, aged 15, Neveu achieved worldwide celebrity status when she won the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition. Unable to afford the cost of travel to Warsaw, the family was helped by Flesch, who paid for the trip. In the preliminary round (of 180 competitors) Neveu was placed first, 26 points ahead of David Oistrakh, and in the final again she came in first. She was 15, Oistrakh 27 at the time. Henri Temianka was placed third. Neveu was immediately signed to an extensive touring contract which over the next two years saw her give solo performances at the leading concert halls of Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. Neveu's international career was interrupted by World War II, during which she gave few concerts, nearly all in France. Many invitations to play in Germany were turned down. She was finally able to make her London debut in 1946. She recorded Sibelius's Violin Concerto at Abbey Road Studios in the same year. Her brother Jean-Paul usually accompanied her on piano, and the two toured postwar Europe extensively, appearing at the Prague Spring International Music Festival as well as visiting Australia and South America. They also played return engagements at major venues in the United States. At one concert in the Royal Albert Hall, Queen Elizabeth was so moved by the Beethoven Concerto that she invited Neveu up to the royal box for the second half. 'On the platform,' wrote the critic of the New York Telegram, 'Ginette Neveu is an impressive figure - tall, dark, and with an imposing manner. Whenever there is a rest for the violin she stands like an acolyte robed in white, her eyes fixed on the conductor ... it is fascinating.' Neveu made few commercial recordings, but all of them remain in the catalogue. She recorded the Brahms and Sibelius Concertos, Ravel's Tzigane, Chausson's Poeme, the Debussy Sonata (with her brother) and a handful of shorter pieces. There are also two recordings of her Beethoven Concerto (with Rosbaud and Otterloo conducting) and two other recordings of her Brahms (with Dorati and Schmidt-Isserstedt) from non-commercial sources. Most highly praised, and most revelatory, was her Sibelius (with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Walter Susskind). Of it, the composer wrote, 'I particularly wish to speak of my feeling of profound gratitude when I think of the inspired and extremely sensitive performance of my Violin Concerto which Ginette Neveu rendered unforgettable.' She loved the Concerto, but, as she said, 'Ils ne le connaissent en France, et ils ne veulent pas le connaitre!' (They don't know it in France, and they don't want to know it!). Perhaps she was thinking of that difficult concerto when she wrote, 'As far as I am concerned, the truly technical problems which are the most disconcerting and the most fruitful are those posed by composers who have a strong personality and pursue the essence of their musical idea to its logical conclusion without wasting too much sympathy on the performer.' Plane crash and death Neveu's grave in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Neveu gave her last concert in Paris on 20 October 1949. On 27 October, she was on board an Air France flight from Paris to New York when it crashed on a mountain after two failed attempts to make a landing at the Santa Maria Airport in the Azores. All 48 people on board the flight died, including Ginette and her brother Jean Neveu, and the French former boxing champion Marcel Cerdan. From her violin, an Omobono Stradivari, only the scroll has been found. During the return of the bodies to France, Neveu's coffin was confused with that of another victim, Am√©lie Ringler, whose funeral took place before the error was discovered. On 28 November, Neveu's brother- in-law identified her remains in the coffin disinterred from the graveyard in Bantzenheim. Neveu now lies in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, close to the grave of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin.  Legacy  Plaque in honour of Neveu at the Salle Pleyel. After Neveu's death, tributes poured in. The Queen of Belgium visited the grieving family, who had lost a son and a daughter. The composer Francis Poulenc, whose Violin Sonata Neveu had premiered (and parts of which she had contributed), wrote, 'I am haunted by the memory of Ginette Neveu. I had the greatest admiration for her and I loved her dearly.' For Pablo Casals, 'Her playing was one of the greatest revelations, both instrumental and musical.' Charles Munch, newly installed conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who had often worked with her, wrote 'Dear Ginette, the memory of you will never cease to haunt us, and each time that by the grace of God we are able to make music really well, we shall feel you very close to us.' Jacques Thibaud, the great French violinist (who would himself die in a plane crash shortly afterward), wrote, 'Why was it that at the dawn of her days an unjust and relentless stroke of fate should come and cut off a life which was bringing to the world nothing but beauty and joy? But in spite of the sternness of destiny, in the hearts of her friends and of the whole world Ginette is unforgettable. The memory of her will never die.' Neveu was posthumously awarded the Cross of the Legion d'Honneur. A street is named in her memory in the Montmartre region of Paris. References Further reading * M.-J. Ronze-Neveu, G.

Miller (born c. 1949) is a retired United States Army Major General who commanded the US detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Iraq. Detention facilities in Iraq under his command included Abu Ghraib prison, Camp Cropper, and Camp Bucca. He is noted for having trained soldiers in using torture, or \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" in US euphemism,\\"US Operatives Torture Detainees to Death in Afghanistan and Iraq\\" , Project Censored, May 27, 2007 and for carrying out the \\"First Special Interrogation Plan,\\" signed by the Secretary of Defense, against a Guantanamo detainee. Miller was born in Gallipolis, Ohio. He attended Ohio State University where he earned an undergraduate degree in History, following this with a Master of Science in Education Administration at the University of Southern California. Miller is the nephew of Bob Evans, of Bob Evans Restaurants, franchiser from Rio Grande, Ohio. Miller joined the US Army in 1972 and was trained in field artillery and army command. He spent time in Germany before being stationed in Korea in 1980. There, he rose to become assistant chief of staff for operations in Korea. Miller later returned to the United States to become the deputy chief of staff for personnel and installation management for the US Army. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba In November 2002, Miller was given command of Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), where he served into late 2004. He ran the US detention facilities known as Camp X-Ray, Camp Delta, and Camp Echo in the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, Cuba. In 2002 Miller claimed that two-thirds of the 600 prisoners had confessed to being involved in terrorism and were giving \\"actionable intelligence.\\" The U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, authorized in writing the \\"First Special Interrogation Plan,\\" listing 17 techniques to be used on the detainee Mohammed al Qahtani. These were developed in consultation with Miller, who carried them out.\\"U.S. Said to Overstate Value of Guant√°namo Detainees\\", New York Times, June 21, 2004 It was later revealed that such techniques were used more widely against other prisoners as well. Miller advocated the use of extreme torture. At the time, the Red Cross was denied access to detainees.\\"Leaked Guantanamo manual shows Red Cross denied access to groups of detainees\\", Center for Constitutional Rights On September 22, 2003, Miller ordered the arrest of James Yee, an Army captain who served as a chaplain for the Muslim prisoners at Guantanamo. Miller accused Yee of stealing classified documents and smuggling them out of the prison, but those charges were later dropped. Captain Yee was honorably discharged on January 7, 2004. It is believed that no evidence of espionage was found, but records on the case have been sealed. Abu Ghraib prison scandal In 2008, as a result of a joint Senate investigation by the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, it was revealed that on March 14, 2003, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued a legal opinion to William Haynes, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, in which he concluded that federal laws related to the use of torture and other abuse would not apply to US interrogators overseas.\\"A Top Pentagon Lawyer Faces a Senate Grilling On Torture\\", Newsweek, 5 April 2008, accessed 18 January 2013 This was five days before the US invasion of Iraq began on March 19, 2003. Yoo had also been involved in drafting what came to be known as the Torture Memos of August 2002, which had been issued to the CIA. In June 2004, Jack Goldsmith, then head of OLC, advised Defense and the CIA not to rely on these memos.JEFFREY ROSEN, \\"Conscience of a Conservative\\", New York Times magazine, 9 September 2007, accessed 16 January 2013 In August 2003, Miller was sent to Iraq by the Department of Defense to advise on \\"more productive\\" interrogations of Iraqi prisoners. In September, Miller submitted a report that recommended \\"GTMO- ising\\" their approach - combining the detention and interrogation units at Abu Ghraib prison into the Theater Joint Interrogation and Detention Center. Specifically, Miller suggested that prison guards be used to \\"soften up\\" prisoners for interrogations. In his final report on the prison abuse at Abu Ghraib the following year, General Antonio Taguba blamed Miller's recommendations for the abuse. He said that using military police or guards for interrogation was a breach of official policy. Miller denies that he specifically ordered guards to torture prisoners to get information. After the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse story broke in April 2004, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski was suspended. Miller was appointed as the deputy commanding general for detainee operations for Multinational Forces in Iraq. In this role, Miller reported directly to Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez. Miller vowed to reduce the number of prisoners in Abu Ghraib, adhere to military laws as well as the Geneva Convention, investigate allegations of abuse, and reform the Iraqi prison system. He banned the use of hoods on prisoners during transport and set up a new system to allow prisoners to have visitors. Since the investigation of abuses at Abu Ghraib, some have suggested that Miller had earlier encouraged abusive tactics. In an interview with BBC Radio, Janis Karpinski, the former prison commander, claimed that Miller had told her to treat prisoners \\"like dogs,\\" saying, \\"if you allow them to believe at any point that they are more than a dog then you've lost control of them\\".Iraq abuse 'ordered from the top', BBC, June 15, 2004 Major General Miller denies the statement. Colonel Thomas Pappas, head of the military intelligence brigade at Abu Ghraib, has claimed that it was Miller's idea to use attack dogs to intimidate prisoners.\\"General Is Said To Have Urged Use of Dogs\\", Washington Post, May 24, 2004 He said the same tactics were being used at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo. Several of the photos taken at Abu Ghraib show dogs surrounding (and in at least one case biting) screaming, naked detainees. In November 2004, Miller was replaced as deputy commanding general for detainee operations by Major General William H. Brandenburg. =Exercised Fifth Amendment right= In 2006, Miller exercised his use of the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer certain questions while testifying in courts martial cases related to Abu Ghraib.\\"Court in Abuse Case Hears Testimony of General\\", New York Times, May 24, 2006 He also used his right during a hearing before the US Senate in 2006. According to the New York Times: \\"He changed his position when the US Senate Armed Services Committee delayed his retirement until he was more forthcoming.\\" In May 2006, Miller testified at the courts martial of the Abu Ghraib dog handlers that his instructions on the use of dogs had been misunderstood. \\"Testimony at SoCal man's court-martial centers on use of dogs\\", San Jose Mercury, May 25, 2006 Miller testified that he instructed that dogs should be used \\"only for custody and control of detainees\\". The next day Miller's testimony was directly contradicted by Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Phillabaum, the commander of Abu Ghraib's Military Police detachment. Request for war crimes prosecution In November 2006, the German government received a complaint seeking the prosecution of Alberto Gonzales, then- Attorney General and former White House Counsel, for alleged war crimes. Co- defendants included: Geoffrey D. Miller, Donald H. Rumsfeld, George Tenet, Stephen Cambone, Ricardo S. Sanchez, Walter Wojdakowski, Thomas M. Pappas, Barbara Fast, Marc Warren, John Yoo, William J. Haynes, II, David Addington, and Jay Bybee, top political appointees who participated in making policy about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques for CIA and DOD. On November 14, 2006, the German attorney Wolfgang Kaleck filed the complaint with the Public Prosecutor General (Generalbundesanwalt) against Miller for his complicity in torture and other crimes against humanity at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kaleck was acting on behalf of 11 victims of torture and other human rights abuses, as well as about 30 human rights activists and organizations who are co-plaintiffs. The co-plaintiffs to the war crimes prosecution include: 1980 Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel (Argentina), 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner Mart√≠n Almada (Paraguay), Theo van Boven, the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Sister Dianna Ortiz (Torture survivor, Executive Director of Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International), the International Federation for Human Rights, the International Peace Bureau (Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1910), the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (IALANA), European Democratic Lawyers, European Democratic Jurists, International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Comit√© de Acci√≥n Jur√≠dica (CAJ) (Argentina), Liga Argentina por los Derechos del Hombre (Argentina), Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), Lawyers Against the War (LAW) (Canada), Colectivo de Abogados Jos√© Alvear Restrepo (Colombia), Association Africaine des Droits de l'Homme (ASADHO) (Democratic Republic of Congo), Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) (Egypt), Ligue Fran√ßaise des Droits de l'Homme (LDH) (France), (RAV) (Germany), Amman Center for Human Rights Studies (ACHR) (Jordan), Comisi√≥n Mexicana de Defensa y Promoci√≥n de los Derechos Humanos (CMDPDH) (Mexico), Liga Mexicana por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (LIMEDDH), Centro Nicarag√ºense de Derechos Humanos (CENIDH) (Nicaragua), Palestinian Center for Human Rights, Association Tchadienne pour la Promotion et la D√©fense des Droits de l'Homme (ATPDH) (Chad), (RADDHO) (Senegal), The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) (United States), National Lawyers Guild (NLG) (USA), Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International (TASSC) (USA), and Veterans for Peace (USA). On January 7, 2011, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) asked a Spanish judge to subpoena Miller to explain his role in the torture of four former detainees., Common Dreams On April 2, 2015, the Court of Appeal of Paris ordered a first hearing of Miller to be conducted before a French magistrate prior to potential prosecutions. A subpoena will be addressed to Miller. On February 19, 2016, General Miller was summoned on March 1 in Paris, France for his hearing regarding allegation of torture by two French citizens. Congressional testimony In July 2005, discrepancies emerged between Miller's May 2004 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and sworn statements he made three months later.Not so fast, General , Salon (magazine), March 7, 2006'Gaps and Discrepancies', Newsweek, May 24, 2004 :\\"Gen.

The Washington Post reported that Congress delayed his retirement because senators were not confident he told the truth when he testified before them. The Washington Post reports that he was allowed to retire only when he promised, in writing, to appear before Congress, and testify truthfully. At his retirement service, Miller was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, and praised as an \\"innovator\\".\\"Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller retires after 34 years\\" , Army News Service, August 1, 2006 On April 13, 2013, Miller was on a list released by the Russian Federation of Americans banned from entering the country because of their alleged human rights violations. The list was a direct response to the so- called Magnitsky list revealed by the United States the day before.

It has been described as one of the finest Romanesque structures in Tuscany and one of the most scenic churches in Italy. There is an adjoining Olivetan monastery, seen to the right of the basilica when ascending the stairs.Borgi di Toscana: Basilica of san minato al Monte, Florence History St. Miniato or Minas () was an Armenian prince serving in the Roman army under Emperor Decius. He was denounced as a Christian after becoming a hermit and was brought before the Emperor who was camped outside the gates of Florence. The Emperor ordered him to be thrown to beasts in the Amphitheatre where a panther was called upon him but refused to devour him. Beheaded in the presence of the Emperor, he is alleged to have picked up his head, crossed the Arno and walked up the hill of Mons Fiorentinus to his hermitage. A shrine was later erected at this spot and there was a chapel there by the 8th century. Construction of the present church was begun in 1013 by Bishop Alibrando and it was endowed by the Emperor Henry II. The adjoining monastery began as a Benedictine community, then passed to the Cluniacs and then in 1373 to the Olivetans, who still run it. The monks make famous liqueurs, honey and herbal teas, which they sell from a shop next to the church. Interior Interior of the church.Zodiac detail, from the opus sectile pavement in San MiniatoThe mosaic depicting St. Miniato to the right of Christ holding a crown. The inscription reads: S. MINIATUS REX ERMINIE.The interior exhibits the early feature of a choir raised on a platform above the large crypt. It has changed little since it was first built. The patterned pavement dates from 1207. The centre of the nave is dominated by the beautiful freestanding Cappella del Crocefisso (Chapel of the Crucifix), designed by Michelozzo in 1448. It originally housed the miraculous crucifix now in Santa Tr√¨nita and is decorated with panels long thought to be painted by Agnolo Gaddi. The terracotta decoration of the vault is by Luca della Robbia. The mosaic of Christ between the Virgin and St Minias was made in 1297. The crypt is the oldest part of the church and the high altar supposedly contains the bones of St Minias himself (although there is evidence that these were removed to Metz before the church was even built). In the vaults are frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi. The raised choir and presbytery contain a magnificent Romanesque pulpit and screen made in 1207. The apse is dominated by a great mosaic dating from 1297, which depicts the same subject as that on the fa√ßade and is probably by the same unknown artist. The crucifix above the high altar is attributed to Luca della Robbia. The sacristy is decorated with a great fresco cycle on the Life of St Benedict by Spinello Aretino (1387). =Cardinal of Portugal Chapel= The Cappella del Cardinale del Portogallo to the left of the nave, \\"one of the most magnificent funerary monuments of the Italian Renaissance\\", was built in 1473 as a memorial to Cardinal James of Lusitania, who died in Florence, to which he was Portuguese ambassador, in 1459. It is the only tomb in the church. The chapel is a collaboration of outstanding artists of Florence: it was designed by Brunelleschi's associate, Antonio Manetti, and finished after his death by Antonio Rossellino. The tomb was made by Antonio and Bernardo Rossellino. The chapel decoration is by Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo, and Luca della Robbia. Exterior The geometrically patterned marble fa√ßade was probably begun in about 1090, although the upper parts date from the 12th century or later, financed by the Florentine Arte di Calimala (cloth merchants‚Äô guild), who were responsible for the church‚Äôs upkeep from 1288. The eagle which crowns the fa√ßade was their symbol. The campanile collapsed in 1499 and was replaced in 1523, although it was never finished. During the siege of Florence in 1530 it was used as an artillery post by the defenders and Michelangelo had it wrapped in mattresses to protect it from enemy fire. Church complex The Cemetery from the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte by Hans von Bartels. Adjacent to the church is the fine cloister, planned as early as 1426 and built from 1443 to mid-1450s. It was also designed by Bernardo and Antonio Rosselino, and financed by the Arte della Mercantia of Florence,According to the Strozzi papers that recorded excerpts of the lost accounts quoting archival accounts. and the fortified bishop‚Äôs palace, built in 1295 and later used as a barracks and a hospital. The whole complex is surrounded by defensive walls, originally built hastily by Michelangelo during the siege and in 1553 expanded into a true fortress (fortezza) by Cosimo I de' Medici. The walls now enclose a large ornate monumental cemetery, the Porte Sante, laid out in 1854. Buried there are Carlo Collodi, creator of Pinocchio; politician Giovanni Spadolini; painter Pietro Annigoni; poet and author Luigi Ugolini; film producer Mario Cecchi Gori; sculptor Libero Andreotti; fine artist Maria Luisa Ugolini Bonta; soprano Marietta Piccolomini; writer Giovanni Papini; and experimental physicist Bruno Benedetto Rossi. Notable events The basilica served as an important setting in Brian de Palma's 1976 film Obsession. On 16 June 2012, it was the venue for the religious wedding of Dutch royal Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma with businessman Albert Brenninkmeijer.

Early military career In 1916‚Äì17 Skar≈ºy≈Ñski was a member of the Polish Military Organisation (POW). In November 1918 he volunteered for the newly created Polish Army, and commanded units disarming German soldiers in Warta. He then fought in the Polish-Soviet War with the infantry, being promoted to second lieutenant in 1919. He was wounded but returned to the front. During the battle of Radzymin he was severely wounded in one leg on 16 August 1920. The infected wound needed long rehabilitation, and Skar≈ºy≈Ñski always limped thereafter. Unable to continue serving in the infantry, he managed to transfer to the military aviation arm. He completed pilot training in Bydgoszcz in 1925, and served in the 1st Aviation Regiment in Warsaw. In 1927 he became a Flying Captain (kapitan pilot). Between 1 and 5 February May 1931 together with Lt. Andrzej Markiewicz, he flew around Africa in the Polish-designed aircraft PZL ≈Å-2 (registration SP-AFA), a total distance of 25,770 km. Transatlantic flight On 7/8 May 1933 Skarzynski flew solo in a small single-seater Polish tourist airplane RWD-5bis (SP-AJU) across the southern Atlantic, from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Maceio in Brazil. The flight took 20 hours 30 minutes (17 hours 15 minutes above the ocean). He crossed 3,582 km, establishing a distance World Record in a FAI tourist plane category II (weight below 450 kg / 1000 lb). The plane had no radio nor safety equipment, due to weight restrictions. The RWD-5bis remains the smallest plane to ever to have flown across the Atlantic. Plans of his flight were kept secret. It became a part of Warsaw ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro flight, between 27 April and 10 May 17,885 km long. He then flew on to Buenos Aires and returned to Europe by ship. Later service and World War II In 1934, he was promoted to major and commanded a bomber squadron. From 1938, he was deputy C.O. of the 4th Aviation Regiment in Toru≈Ñ, with a rank of lieutenant colonel (podpu≈Çkownik pilot). In April 1939, he became President of the Polish Aero Club. In August 1939 he was sent to Romania as the deputy air attach√©. After the outbreak of World War II, he helped in transporting Polish pilots, fleeing from Poland, through Romania to France, where the Polish Air Force was recreated. In 1940 Skar≈ºy≈Ñski, after the fall of France, helped ship 17,000 Polish airmen to Britain, where he became commanding officer of Polish Flying Schools at RAF Hucknall and then RAF Newton. He requested a combat posting, and was assigned as C.O. of RAF Lindholme and No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron. On 26 June 1942, while returning from a mission over Bremen, an engine stalled in his Wellington above the North Sea. Skar≈ºy≈Ñski ditched the heavy damaged aircraft in the stormy sea and all the crew were saved. Skar≈ºy≈Ñski, leaving the Wellington last, was washed out to sea and was the only crew member lost. He was later buried with full military honours on the Dutch island of Terschelling. Honours Statue of Stanis≈Çaw Skar≈ºy≈Ñski in his hometown, Warta He was awarded the Virtuti Militari 5th class (for the Polish-Soviet war), Cross of Independence, Order of Polonia Restituta 4th class, Krzy≈º Walecznych (four times), Golden and Silver Cross of Merit, the French Legion d'Honneur and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross. The FAI awarded him the Louis Bl√©riot medal (1936) of which he was one of the first recipients. Posthumously he was made a full colonel (pu≈Çkownik pilot) and awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta 2nd class by the President of Poland. There are numerous streets and schools named after him. He is the Patron of the Aeroclub of W≈Çoc≈Çawek and of the 13th Transport Squadron in Krak√≥w. On 10 August 2009 the Minister of National Defense signed the Decree to appoint him as Patron of 8 Air Base in Krak√≥w ‚Äì Balice, which now is named after him.

Were the fleet to leave port and face the enemy, it might lose in battle and no longer influence the enemy's actions, but while it remains safely in port, the enemy is forced to continually deploy forces to guard against it. A \\"fleet in being\\" can be part of a sea denial doctrine, but not one of sea control. Use of the term The term was first used in 1690 when Lord Torrington, commander of the Royal Navy forces in the English Channel, found himself facing a stronger French fleet. He proposed avoiding a sea battle, except under very favourable conditions, until he could be reinforced. By thus keeping his \\"fleet in being\\", he could maintain an active threat which would force the enemy to remain in the area and prevent them from taking the initiative elsewhere. =Secondary use= Rudyard Kipling published a series of articles about the British Channel Fleet under the title A Fleet in Being: Notes of three trips with the Channel Squadron in 1898, but did not use the term in the sense described here. Concept The \\"fleet in being\\" concept is based on the assumption that the fleet is relatively safe in port, even if near the enemy. After the battle of Taranto and the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, it became obvious that air power made a fleet concentrated in a port vulnerable, and a fleet in being was normally no longer a safe option. It is, of course, possible to imagine a situation where a fleet is still relatively safe in harbour, such as the opponent being unwilling to attack them in harbour for political reasons. After looking at the alternatives, \\"The strategy that was accepted for the Argentine Navy [in the 1982 Falklands War] was one of a 'fleet in being' concept ... The fleet would not conduct a direct attack; they would only attack when the odds were in their favor. Otherwise, they would remain outside any declared British exclusion zones and wait for a target of opportunity.\\" The Argentines were not able to make any positive use of their \\"fleet in being\\", because the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano by HMS Conqueror showed that the World War II-era cruisers and other assets of the Argentine Navy were vulnerable to attack from contemporary submarines. The idea of a \\"fleet in being\\" can be generalised to forces other than naval. A fortress under siege is essentially an \\"army in being\\", which ties up enemy forces without leaving the fortress or doing much fighting. During the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein used his air force with an operational doctrine analogous to \\"fleet in being\\". cite The mere presence of the Iraqi Air Force in hardened bunkers forced the coalition attacking Iraq to act cautiously and to escort its bomber sorties, until the aircraft shelters were found to be vulnerable. History =Russo-Japanese War 1904‚Äì1905= The first modern example was the stand-off between the Imperial Russian Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Russia possessed three battle fleets: one in the Baltic Sea, the second in the Black Sea, and the third in the Far East. The Pacific squadron in the Far East was stationed at Vladivostok and Port Arthur. With the latter being closer to the land war, Port Arthur became strategically more important. The IJN possessed only one battle fleet to the Russian Navy's three, therefore it was imperative that the IJN not have to fight all three of them. The Anglo- Japanese Treaty of 1902 effectively eliminated the Black Sea fleet by keeping it blocked in the Black Sea, lest they risk war with Britain. However, the Baltic Fleet (later renamed the 2nd Pacific Squadron) had orders to reinforce the Port Arthur squadron sometime in 1905. It would be the IJN's mission to preempt that move. Only after Port Arthur's \\"fleet in being\\" was eliminated could the Baltic Fleet and Japanese fleet square off; and this would happen the following year, during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. In order to permanently eliminate Port Arthur's battle squadron, the IJN initiated three operations. The first was a surprise destroyer torpedo attack inside the harbor in early February 1904. This was quickly followed up with an attempt to block the harbor's entrance by sinking old steam ships (block ships) in the channel. The third and final attempt of permanently bottling up the fleet was the mining of the waters surrounding the harbor's entrance. Although this last attempt also failed, it had the unintended consequence of robbing the Russian Navy of one of its most brilliant naval officers, Admiral Stepan Makarov. When his flagship, the battleship Petropavlovsk, struck one of those mines she sank almost immediately, drowning Makarov with the crew. The \\"fleet in being\\" remained so, until under the new command of Admiral Vilgelm Vitgeft, the Port Arthur squadron was ordered to break out and steam for Vladivostok on 10 August 1904. Vitgeft's exit from Port Arthur resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, an excessively long-ranged gun duel that resulted in no capital warships being sunk on either side, but finally eliminated Port Arthur's \\"fleet in being\\", as its warships became dispersed to neutral ports (where they were interned), and the survivors were so heavily damaged that they were no longer serviceable. =World War I= A later example is the stand-off between the German High Seas Fleet and the British Grand Fleet during World War I. Germany largely preferred to keep its fleet intact rather than taking the risk of losing a major engagement with the larger Royal Navy, particularly after the Battle of Jutland. =World War II= In World War II, actions of the Italian Regia Marina in 1940 also demonstrate the idea of a \\"fleet in being\\". After a number of minor battles against the Royal Navy that were mostly inconclusive, the bulk of Italian fleet was left in Taranto from where it could sortie very quickly against any British attempt to reach Malta, exerting a \\"disproportionate influence on British strategy and fleet disposition\\". Even after the great tactical success of the British aircraft carrier attack on Taranto in November 1940, the British failure to deliver a decisive blow to the Italian fleet resulted in the Royal Navy tying up substantial naval forces in the Mediterranean for the next three years. Even more so than other surface vessels in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine (navy), the German battleship Tirpitz served her entire career as a \\"fleet in being\\" in her own right. Although she never fired a shot at an enemy ship, her mere presence in the Norwegian fiords forced the Royal Navy to allocate powerful warships in defending Arctic convoys, and caused a major convoy (PQ 17) to scatter, suffering huge losses, mainly to U-boats and aircraft. A midget submarine attack and successive airstrikes launched by the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm removed the threat by November 1944, when the Tirpitz was sunk at Tromso.
