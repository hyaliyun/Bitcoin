History  In November 1936, representatives of the Second Spanish Republic (Spanish Republicans, or Loyalists) began a campaign to hire American pilots to fight in the Spanish Civil War. They used a New York lawyer to find American pilots. Time magazine reported on December 21, 1936 that six U.S. fliers were on the ocean liner SS Normandie, headed for Spain, to join their leader, Bert Acosta. They were to be paid $1,500 a month, plus $1,000 for each Aviaci√≥n Nacional plane destroyed. Time reported that the six men were: \\"[h]ilariously celebrating in the ship's bar of the Normandie with their first advance pay checks from Spain's Radical Government ... en route last week for Madrid to join Bert Acosta, pilot of Admiral Byrd's transatlantic flight, in doing battle against Generalissimo Francisco Franco's White planes.\\" British and French pilots were given two weeks of training, but the Americans were expected to fly as soon as they arrived. Another American flyer, Hilaire du Berrier, was already in Spain by time they arrived. Frederic Ives Lord became their squadron commander, and he tried to convince the Loyalist authorities that the planes they were given were too dilapidated to fly. When the commandant insisted that the planes were safe, Lord took him up for a test flight, and at two thousand feet up one of the four wings broke off. The commandant motioned Lord to climb higher so they could escape by using their parachutes. Lord wanted to try to land with the remaining lower wings intact. He landed the plane safely but was arrested at the airfield. An airplane mechanic intervened and explained that his loss of the wing was accidental, and was not intentional. The pilots went to Valencia, Spain to complain to the Second Spanish Republic air ministry, but nothing changed. Acosta, Schneider and Lord planned to escape from Bilbao to Biarritz, France by motorboat after they had been refused a promised Christmas leave. Their plan was discovered and the pilot of their boat was arrested and executed. The pilots were then jailed for 18 hours. They then returned to the United States.  Return to United States  Four of them resigned and returned to the United States in January. The Associated Press reported that \\"the flyers protested they were given nothing but unarmed sports planes with which to fight, while Russian pilots were assigned \\"regular American army planes.\\" The Spanish Air Force had no US-built planes; the main fighters used by the Republicans during the war were the Soviet-built Polikarpov I-15 and I-16. The latter was often mistaken for the Boeing P-26, but was not related to it. The flyers said both the socialist and fascist air forces in Spain were staffed almost entirely by foreigners. The fliers later told the Washington Post that they had quit because \\"'it would be suicide to continue' and because their actions 'might not be in tune with the spirit of neutrality'... While other airmen ‚Äì British and French ‚Äì were afforded a two-week courtesy for training, American fliers were just shown to loyalist hangars, given a plane and ordered to do their stuff. 'We were flying old crates,' Acosta said, 'while other nationalists were given modern ships. But for the protection afforded us by Soviet pursuit planes we would not be alive now to tell you this tale.'\\" Eddie August Schneider explained his motives in flying for the Republic: \\"I was broke, hungry, jobless ... yet despite the fact that all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part for the development of the industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer?\\" The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never withdrawn their allegiance to the United States. The flyers claimed that they were not paid what was promised them by the Spanish government. Acosta and Berry started legal proceedings against the Spanish steamship Mar Cantabrico to try to collect the back pay that was due each of them. The consul general for the Spanish government, Luis Careaga, arrived in the US and paid some of the money, and declared that they were now paid in full. Their lawyer, Lewis Landes, claimed Acosta and Berry were still owed $1,500 and Schneider $1,200.

Created by Jack Kirby for the \\"Jack Kirby's Fourth World\\" meta-series, he first appeared in New Gods #1 (February 1971). Lightray was a major character in New Gods volume 1 (1971-1978), as well as volume 2 (1984), volume 3 (1989-1991) and volume 4 (1995-1997). He has also appeared with Orion in the Cosmic Odyssey limited series (1988-1989), Jack Kirby's Fourth World (1997-1998) and Orion (2000-2002). Seven years after the character's creation, Lightray's origin story was revealed in DC Special Series #10, a Secret Origins of Super-Heroes issue that was published in January 1978. The version of the character in current DC continuity was introduced in Green Lantern/New Gods: Godhead #1 in December 2014. Characterization For the fourth volume of New Gods created by in 1995, Rachel Pollack and Tom Peyer discussed with Back Issue magazine how Lightray changed after Darkseid is killed by Orion in New Gods issue #2: Walt Simonson, who wrote the Orion series starting in 2000, says that his conception of Lightray and Orion was based on the relationship that Kirby established in New Gods volume 1. In 2018, Simonson said: \\"I saw Lightray as a strategist, whereas Orion is more a tactician. Jack actually had Orion refer to Lightray as a planner at the clima of the Deep Six story, \\"The Glory Boat!\\" (New Gods #6, Jan. 1972). I tried basing my notions of Lightray primarily on that story\\". In Superheroes of the Round Table, Jason Tondro characterizes Lightray's place in Kirby's New Gods work: \\"We have characters like... the amazing Lightray, a denizen of New Genesis who embodies light with all of its creativity, bright humor, and intelligence... Lightray embodies illumination\\". Tondro says Lightray \\"and other characters, both good and evil, hint at the full dimensions of Kirby's epic pantheon\\". Fictional character biography Lightray is the shining star of New Genesis and a high-spirited New God. Unlike his grim friend Orion, Lightray is cheerful and optimistic and prefers to solve problems through compromise rather than combat. He uses the speed of light to his advantage in eluding foes. Cover art for Countdown #48. Art by Andy Kubert. Lightray has served one stint as a member of the Justice League. He joined the international branch along with Orion on the same night as a membership drive failed to find other new recruits.Justice League America #42, September 1990 The difference between the two was illustrated in battle. While Lightray desires a minimum of fuss in battle by dispatching his foe Crowbar with a simple expenditure of energy to the man's face, Orion preferred to destroy the pavement around Blackrock, only to then be angered when his opponent surrendered instead of fighting to the death.Ibid #44 In this same issue, Lightray demonstrates his knowledge of chess. Lightray's long hair causes him to be mistaken for a girl by the old-fashioned General Glory. They stay with the team until just after the battle with General Glory's old foe the Evil Eye.Ibid #50, May 1991 As Solis his idea of fun is protecting New Genesis from Apokolips, Darkseid, and his minions. He resides on New Genesis and is active in adventuring. He returns to Earth briefly in JLA #27 (March 1999), as part of an emergency expansion of the Justice League. The team battles the android Amazo in the Florida Everglades. Most of them are subdued and their powers copied, Lightray included. Amazo loses his powers when Superman, as the chairman, officially disbands the League, thus ending Lightray's membership. He would appear again to aid the League alongside Orion and Big Barda when the planet Qward attacked earth with a giant ship. In Countdown #48, Lightray falls to earth after an off stage fight with the New Gods Killer (later revealed to be Infinity-Man). He dies holding Jimmy Olsen's hand, repeating the word \\"infinite\\" and glowing brighter. In Final Crisis #7, Lightray is depicted standing alongside Barda and Mister Miracle following the reincarnation of New Genesis on the ruins of Apokolips. Powers and abilities Like all the New Gods, Lightray is functionally immortal and possesses great superhuman strength, endurance and reflexes. Lightray is able to lift several tons with ease. His reflexes and durability are also more than amazing and he has a limited degree of invulnerability. Lightray flies at the speed of light or even faster, and can generate and project solar energy. Thus, he can create brilliant light and extraordinarily high levels of heat. He can focus his solar energy into beams of laser-like intensity. Lightray can also use his powers of light to create life-like illusions. Using his power to the maximum, he can generate a huge sun or a nova explosion. Although Lightray has a pacifist personality and isn't a highly experienced warrior, he is well trained in hand-to-hand combat, but he prefers to use his solar powers in battle. In his headgear Lightray carries one of the powerful \\"living computers\\" called Mother Box. Alternate versions=Seven Soldiers of Victory Lightray makes several brief, non-speaking appearances in Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers of Victory series, where his human form is a frail man on crutches. Captain Carrot In the miniseries Captain Carrot and the Final Ark, Lightray's counterpart in the \\"New Dogs\\" is an anthropomorphic dog named Lightstray. JLA: The Nail In the 1998 Elseworlds JLA: The Nail, Lightray is depicted fighting in a war between New Genesis and Apokolips. Influence Jack Kirby's 1971 design for Lightray's costume influenced the look of artist Al Milgrom's creation of Firestorm in 1978. In an interview from 2019, Milgrom admitted: \\"The facemask on Firestorm, the way it comes around the chin, was probably inspired by Lightray more than anything... I liked the [Lightray] head-covering thing; I said, \\"I'm stealin' it!\\" A July 1971 New Gods story featuring Lightray has been noted as an example of racial bias in 1970s superhero storytelling. In \\"Death and the Black Racer\\" (New Gods #3), Lightray ‚Äî a blond white man ‚Äî is running desperately to escape the Black Racer, portrayed as a person of color. Jos√© Alaniz and Scott T. Smith noted in Uncanny Bodies: Superhero Comics and Disability that the story \\"suggests a racial dichotomy... in which blackness presents as a threatening force\\".

When Batman and Wonder Woman arrive on New Genesis to look for Orion, Lightray taunts them, giving Wonder Woman a playful slap on the behind, prompting her to declare \\"He's worse than the Flash!\\". This leads to a chase around New Genesis as Batman manages to trap Lightray as Orion arrives. Lightray was later seen with Batman, Wonder Woman, and Orion when they meet with Highfather. * Lightray returns in an unspeaking role in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Destroyer\\".

It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It has more than 4,600 enrolled students spread between the main campus and the Porreco College in Erie, Pennsylvania.Edinboro University, \\"Edinboro University Fact Sheet\\", www.edinboro.edu, 2019-2020  History  Edinboro University was founded as the Edinboro Academy, a private training school for Pennsylvania teachers in 1857, by the region's original Scottish settlers. It is the oldest training institution west of the Allegheny Mountains and the second oldest in all of Pennsylvania. In the beginning, Edinboro modestly consisted of one two-story building, six classrooms, three instructors, 110 students and a principal. That original building Academy Hall is currently used as the undergraduate admissions office. In 1861, the Edinboro Academy affiliated with the state government of Pennsylvania to become the second State Normal School in Pennsylvania, occasionally known as the Northwest State Normal School. (Normal schools are teachers colleges.) In 1914, the state purchased the school from the original stockholders and renamed it the Edinboro State Normal School. By 1927, the advancement of academic programs to include liberal arts study required the school to rename itself Edinboro State Teachers College. Further development of the liberal arts to include degree programs outside the field of education resulted in Edinboro becoming Edinboro State College in 1960. Continued development of undergraduate liberal arts programs and advanced graduate degrees earned Edinboro university status in 1983.Edinboro University, \\"Edinboro University History\\", www.edinboro.edu, 2019-2020  Scottish heritage and traditions  Ross Hall As of Spring 2020, Edinboro is the first school in the world to offer a music education degree (BAME) that is open to students with a focus in bagpiping. The university and town that share the Edinboro name were founded by Scottish immigrants. Holding to its tradition, Edinboro University has a pipe band (a band that consists of bagpipes, snare drums and a bass drum) that performs alone and also with the \\"Spirit of the Scots\\" marching band for school related functions. Each year, Edinboro hosts a three-day highland games festival complete with Scottish heavy athletics; dancing; bagpipe band; Celtic harp; and other competitions. The University's fight song is a version of Scotland the Brave.  Campuses  The main campus is located from Erie, Pennsylvania and within of the educational and population centers of McKean, Waterford, and Albion. The main campus has 42 buildings on a campus which includes a lake, open fields and woods, 10 on-campus residence halls (Highlands 1~8, Rose Hall and Earp Hall) for approximately 2,500 students, and the seven-story Baron-Forness Library. Edinboro University offers 150 degree programs and 57 minors. The student- faculty ratio is 18:1. Edinboro students may also choose to complete coursework toward workforce-related associate degrees at the Porreco College in Erie. The Porreco College sits on the former Louis Porreco farm and estate in Millcreek Township and allows local students to complete a community college-like education. The Porreco College consists of 10 buildings in a farm-like setting.  Athletics  Baron-Forness Library Edinboro University offers 17 varsity sports: women's basketball, cross country, lacrosse, volleyball, swimming, soccer, softball, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field, and men's football, wrestling, cross country, basketball, swimming, tennis, wheelchair basketball and outdoor track and field. All but the wrestling and wheelchair basketball are NCAA Division II programs and members of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference. Wrestling competes on the NCAA Division I level, and as of the 2019 season will no longer actively compete against Division II level PSAC wrestling programs as a result of their new affiliation with the Mid-American Conference in wrestling. Its wheelchair basketball team competes in the NWBA Intercollegiate Division.  Student life  Highlands Edinboro University has more than 100 student organizations encompassing academic clubs and honor societies, professional organizations, general student interests, music and theater organizations, and Greek Life. Edinboro's Student Government Association manages a budget of over $1 million, and provides many student services. The student activity fee provides funding for student organizations, athletic programs, and campus programming. The University Programming Board plans and contracts for student activities such as sightseeing and shopping trips, free movies, concerts and comedians, notable guest speakers, and activities in the University Center.

Bach was orphaned at the age of 9 and went to live with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach, who was the organist at the Michaeliskirche and later a teacher at the Lyceum. Johann Sebastian also attended school here. The church contained a three-manual German baroque organ in a historic case of Austrian origin. It was here that Bach learned about organ building. The organ needed constant repairs, and he was sent into the organ often to fix minor problems. The church burned down in 1753 and 1808 when fires raged through the town, but rebuilt each time. The church was again destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945, only the roofless 15th century tower remained. This was covered by a concrete roof until 1998/99 when the tower was reconstructed.

They first appeared in Green Lantern Corps #208 (January 1987), and were created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton. History Originally created for the Soviet Union by Green Lantern Kilowog, the Rocket Red Brigade ‚Äî normal human beings enhanced using \\"forced evolution\\" and armoured battle-suits ‚Äî proudly defended the USSR. Their abilities included super strength, invulnerability, flight (through rocket packs/boots), the ability to project powerful energy blasts and \\"mecha- empathy\\" ‚Äî the ability to sense and control computers and machines (though to what extent is not clear). Rocket Red #1 Decorated Russian soldier Josef Denisovich was a close friend of the alien Green Lantern Kilowog. He was also the first member of the Rocket Red Brigade. Josef was turned against Kilowog by the Soviet government, and died fighting Kilowog. Rocket Red #4Rocket Red #7 The man known as Vladimir Mikoyan turned out to be a Manhunter. Vladmir was the first Rocket Red admitted into Justice League International. During the Millennium event, he was exposed as a Manhunter android and destroyed by Booster Gold (with the assistance of the Justice League and a force of other, human, Rocket Reds). After the Manhunter was discovered, Dimitri Pushkin was admitted into the Justice League. Pozhar While serving as a member of the Red Shadows, Mikhail Denisovitch Arkadin, the Russian hero also known as Pozhar, wore a modified suit of Rocket Red armor. Russian Mafia After the Soviet Union collapsed, the other Rocket Reds fell on hard times. Several were brainwashed to serve as agents of the super- criminal Sonar.Justice League Europe #52 (December 1992) Many of the suits ended up on the black market. As seen in the pages of Chase #3 (April 1998),http://www.dcuguide.com/Chase/Chs_003.php some of the more unscrupulous Rocket Reds began working for the Russian Organizatsiya Mafiya in order to feed their families. Under Vandal Savage's control Later four of the suits came into the possession of Vandal Savage. He imprisoned four of the Titans, Jesse Quick, Arsenal, Tempest, and temporary member Supergirl, in them and used them as missiles. He managed to destroy the South American city of Montevideo, Uruguay though Tempest managed to save himself. The other Titans were saved as well before their respective suits could detonate. Rockets fly again Surviving members of the Rocket Red Brigade took their armor back from the Russian Army to fight the world prison break during the events of Villains United. They also appeared protecting Russia's border in 52, wearing new, more advanced suits of armor. They were seen again in One Year Later protecting Russia while hindering Green Lantern Hal Jordan's attempt to apprehend an interstellar criminal in Green Lantern #10. After the ensuing situation was resolved, the current Rocket Red #1 is even promoted as a possible Justice League member in the future, should the League plan to expand. Ice was hidden in a suit of Rocket Red armor during her regeneration. In Checkmate v.2 # 22, it is revealed that Checkmate has since recruited the current Rocket Red # 1, Captain Maks Chazov, as its White Queen's Knight, with the apparent consent of Chazov's Russian government superiors. In Blackest Night #3, the Rocket Reds were briefly seen in battle with Dimitri Pushkin, whose body had been reanimated as a Black Lantern. In Justice League of America #45, the League meets the German Rakete-Auslese, or \\"Rocket Elite\\", who Batman notes are the German equivalent of the Rocket Reds, and use some of the same technology in their flying battlesuits. During Mon-El's tour of the earth, he visits Moscow and helps the Rocket Reds during a battle with Georgian terrorists. Afterwards, a female Rocket Red pilot named Ivana takes Mon on a tour of St. Basil's Cathedral and gives him the first kiss he's ever received from a human.Superman #689 The Rocket Red Brigade appears in Justice League: Generation Lost #4.

In this new timeline, Gavril is admitted into the new, United Nations-sanctioned Justice League as the official representative of Russia.Justice League International #1 In other media=Television * Rocket Red is seen briefly in various Justice League Unlimited cartoons, notably in the episodes \\"The Return\\" and \\"Panic in the Sky\\". Though his personal name is not given, his armor is the same as Dmitri's (Rocket Red No. 4) second suit. In \\"The Return\\", Rocket Red is one of the many heroes mobilized to defend Earth against the threat of Amazo. He is assigned to the second line of defense in the upper atmosphere, along with Supergirl, Fire and Red Tornado. The team is attacked by Amazo during his subsequent search for Lex Luthor. After a head-on collision with Amazo, Supergirl becomes the first casualty of the battle and falls, unconscious, into the ocean. Rocket Red then attempts to stop Amazo by firing a barrage of missiles from his suit. When this has little effect, Rocket Red opens fire with his shoulder-mounted gatling gun and tries to retreat. However, Amazo pursues him and rips the gun from his armor. Later that episode, Rocket Red reappears briefly to carry the unconscious Fire out of the losing battle, moments before the last member of the team, Red Tornado, is destroyed by Amazo. He is also seen helping in the rescue efforts of the league after their weapon system is overtaken by Lex Luthor and fired at Cadmus Headquarters. * The Dmitri Pushkin version of Rocket Red appeared in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth\\". * The Rocket Red Brigade appears in the Young Justice: Outsiders episode \\"Leverage\\". This version is led by Commander Olga Illyich (voiced by Stephanie Lemelin) who operates as \\"Rocket Red #1\\" and also has Dmitri Pushkin (voiced by Steve Blum) as one of their newest members (operating as Rocket Red #4). The Rocket Red Brigade was created the Russian government to serve as their equivalent to the Justice League. The Rocket Red Brigade were deployed to fight off Task Force X (Captain Boomerang, Monsieur Mallah, and Black Manta), who were sent to one of their research facilities to eliminate them. The villains were driven off by Tigress, Beast Boy, Geo-Force, Halo, and Terra, but the Brigade encountered them and helped defeat the villains.

It is an opulent Italianate Villa, modified with touches of Steamboat Gothic and Victorian details. It is a California Historical Landmark and is designated a National Historic Landmark. It is now part of Notre Dame de Namur University.  The mansion  Ralston Hall Mansion is situated on the campus of Notre Dame de Namur University, on the San Francisco Peninsula. The mansion has been built around the villa of Count Leonetto Cipriani, former owner of the estate. Taking three years to build, it was completed in 1867, when San Francisco's leaders and first citizens had large summer homes on the Peninsula, an integral part of San Francisco high society. Architect John Painter Gaynor, who later worked with Ralston on the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, is thought to have worked on it. Several of the design elements of Ralston Hall Mansion were copied in the design of the Palace. A history of San Francisco speaks of the palatial grandeur of Ralston Hall: \\"In a domed wing was the oval ballroom. Its walls were mirrored, and from the frescoed ceiling hung a great crystal chandelier whose reflected lights and sparkle filled the room. I have never seen a more effective setting for a ball.\\" The Hall is a four-floor, mansion, with a stately dining room, a mirrored ballroom in the Versailles tradition, an opera box modelled after the Op√©ra Garnier in Paris, a grand staircase, 23 crystal chandeliers, and inlaid wood floors. Ralston greatly admired the Palace of Versailles, and incorporated several of the palace's elements in his design of the mansion. The mansion has a number of elegant sitting rooms and parlours. The Oriental Music Room has a set of Chinese high-tea chairs and buffets. Ralston Hall houses a collection of antiques accumulated by Ralston, including some valuable Thomas Hill paintings. The grounds of the mansion contain numerous gardens, a stoney grotto, and a garden of 150-year-old bamboo trees.  Uses of the mansion  After Ralston's death, the estate passed to his former business partner, United States Senator from Nevada William Sharon, whose family lived in the house. Sharon's daughter Flora's wedding to Englishman Sir Thomas George Fermor-Hesketh, 7th Baronet, of Rufford was one of the last elaborate social events of the time, taking place in the mansion's ballroom. After Senator Sharon's death in 1885, the mansion became Radcliffe Hall, a girls' finishing school. From 1900 to 1922, it was the Gardner Sanitarium. Since 1922, Ralston Hall has been on the campus Notre Dame de Namur University, formerly the College of Notre Dame. It contains the admissions office and is rented out for society weddings and other occasions. A few of the notable persons who have been entertained at Ralston Hall include: * President Ulysses S.

The leader of the hiveworld Korll, Zazzala lives only for the interstellar expansion of her species. Zazzala first appeared in Justice League of America #23 (November 1963). She clashed with the original Justice League several times during the 1960s and 1970s, but largely disappeared for several decades. Fictional character biographies=Queen Bee (Zazzala) Zazzala reappeared in JLA volume 3, #34 (October 1999), when Lex Luthor contacts her to join his Injustice Gang. She agrees, freeing The General from his asteroid prison in exchange for a percentage of Earth's population to become her drones. She also participates in other battles against the League. Her main effort is concentrated upon the city of New York. She forces many of the citizens to craft an 'egg matrix' out of local supplies as a way to secure even more mind- control. She attempts to brainwash Green Lantern and Steel to serve her using 'hypno-pollen', but both heroes are able to fight it off; Huntress encouraged Green Lantern to resist the pollen, and Steel's suit's data-protection immune systems protected him from the pollen's effects (Although Steel still pretended that the pollen had affected him in order to wait for the right moment to figure out what he should attack in order to do the most damage). The Queen displayed impressive physical strength, as she was able to overpower, dominate, and defeat Big Barda in direct combat. Using the Queen Bee's inability to see the color red, which many of the superheroes had in their costumes, Wonder Woman and Big Barda keep the Queen's forces occupied while Steel and Plastic Man get the drop on the Queen, Plastic Man covering Steel to render him virtually invisible to the bees. Utilizing a Boom Tube, technology controlled by Barda, they teleport the Queen and her army back to Korll. Later, Zazzala and her drones join Lex Luthor's new Secret Society of Super Villains. The Queen becomes the leader of the H.I.V.E., a multi-national criminal enterprise. She appears in the six-part Villains United limited series. A small team of villains, known as the Secret Six, attack her base as part of a war against the Society. Her forces are defeated, the base's prisoner, Firestorm, is freed and Zazzala herself is badly wounded. One Year Later, Zazzala appears in JLA volume 4, #20, fully healed from her injuries, and attempting to steal a matter transportation device that will appear to allow her to transport her troops to earth. She is defeated by Wonder Woman and captured by the Flash. Queen Bee (Marcia Monroe) Marcia Monroe was a spoiled young woman, daughter of a wealthy man, who enjoyed risking her life in absurd and pointless situations. Her playgirl attitude created trouble for the police, who often tried to save her from harm during her own stunts. One day, she was rescued by Batman, who brought her down to the ground and spanked her in public, making news in the headlines of the most notorious newspapers. Shortly after this encounter, Marcia started following Batman on his crime- busting activities and provided unrequested help when Batman least expected it. Marcia revealed that Batman's vulgar display of power was enough to make her fall in love with him. Batman and Marcia became an inseparable couple, but one day, she vanished without a trace. Some time later, Batman saved a girl from being attacked with an arrow and soon he realized it was Marcia. She had returned to Gotham to ask Batman to return a valuable stolen gem which she had acquired from her father. Batman agreed to help her, but Marcia double-crossed Batman and provided evidence to the police incriminating Batman for the stealing of the gem. It was later revealed that Marcia had joined the crime syndicate known as CYCLOPS under the codename of Queen Bee. She was the leader of the task force that was in charge of releasing Eclipso from his human host, Bruce Gordon. With Eclipso's help, Queen Bee started a criminal spree and a campaign to get the criminal organizations of Gotham City under the control of CYCLOPS. However, when Eclipso threatened to murder Batman, Marcia intervened and saved the man she loved. She then revealed that she had been forced to join CYCLOPS in order to save her father. Marcia helped Batman find a way to escape from Eclipso's trap and before parting ways, she gave Batman the real stolen gem and promised to stall Eclipso for a moment until he managed to escape. Batman was able to clear his name and stopped Eclipso with Bruce Gordon's help, but Marcia vanished from his life once again and never returned. Queen Bee of Bialya An unrelated Queen Bee was introduced in Justice League International #16 (August 1988). She was an ordinary human femme fatale, who gained control of the terrorist nation of Bialya by forging an alliance with its former ruler Colonel Rumaan Harjavti then assassinating him. She solidified her power by brainwashing the Global Guardians into serving her. She has clashed several times with Justice League International and Justice League Europe. Justice League Europe found out that the Queen Bee was behind their recent troubles, and that she had a Dominator named Doctor working for her. They invaded her palace and came to an agreement; she would cease hostilities against them if they kept quiet about the unethical things she was doing as Queen. They also demanded she sever relations with the Doctor. After they left, she killed the Doctor. The Queen had far-reaching influences, managing to put one of her own operatives in charge of the League via the United Nations.(JLA #53-54 ‚Ä¢ JLE #29-30) The Queen Bee was eventually defeated by the JLE and the Guardians, who learned of her brainwashing plot. She was assassinated by Rumaan Harjavti's brother Sumaan, during the events of the JLA/JLE crossover Breakdowns (1991). Queen Bee (Tazzala) Queen Bee appeared in the 2000 Creature Commandos series. On the otherdimensional world of Terra Arcana, Zazzala's sister Tazzala joined Simon Magus's Terra Arcana Army with the ultimate goal of conquering Earth. The U.S. Army faction known as the Creature Commandos stopped the invasion plans. Tazzala herself was killed by Simon. Queen Bee of Bialya (Beatriz) The sister of the second Queen Bee, Beatriz was introduced in JLA: Incarnations #6 (December 2001, but set around 1996) as the new ruler of Bialya. She is using humans forged with machinery and passed off as the robot Extremists to police her country. Her fate since Captain Atom's Extreme Justice team brought an end to these activities is unknown, but she was presumably toppled from power as she no longer rules Bialya. H.I.V.E. QueenThe New 52= In \\"The New 52\\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Queen Bee is revamped and renamed the H.I.V.E. Queen. She makes her debut in Superman #21 as the leader of H.I.V.E.Superman Vol 3 #21 August 2013 She claims to be Brainiac's daughter.Superman Vol 3 #21 August 2013 She is a member of the Twenty, a group of otherwise ordinary Metropolis citizens who are infected with a virus by Brainiac that grants them each psionic powers. However, her worldview is distorted and she becomes a zealous devotee of the alien. She creates H.I.V.E. using the fa√ßade of a benevolent social media company. Her plan is to actually kidnap other people with psionic potential and use their harvested mental energy to enslave the world in preparation for Brainiac's return. After trying to bend the telepath Hector Hammond to her will but inadvertedly unleashing him, her entire plan is thwarted. She comes into conflict with the latter as well as another telepath, the Psycho Pirate, also a member of the Twenty, during the Psi War storyline. Superman and Lois Lane, who had also been infected with the same psionic virus, manage to defeat them. The H.I.V.E. Queen disappears in the aftermath of the battle.Superman Vol 3 #21-24 She reappears much later in Teen Titans, where she takes control of the entire city of New Orleans. She then has the mind-controlled citizenry build satellite dishes that are actually psionic amplifiers that will allow her to take over every mind across the United States. However, the Titans are in the city at the same time and manage to resist her mental influence thanks to Raven's magic. Robin and the latter eventually assault her base and defeat her, freeing the city from her control.Teen Titans Vol 4 #23 =DC Rebirth= The H.I.V.E. Queen returns in the pages of Red Hood and the Outlaws, having set up a new base of operations in Gotham City. Red Hood confronts her over millions of dollars he stole from Penguin which the crime boss owed her for services rendered. Jason uses his suit's taser to disable her henchmen and she is knocked out by Bizarro and captured before she can read Jason's mind.

Powers and abilities The first Queen Bee, Zazzala, has insect-like superhuman strength and speed, can fire venomous stinger darts from a set of glands on her right wrist, or release mind-confusing \\"pollen\\" powder. She and her drones are unable to perceive the color red. She is a capable enough combatant to fight Big Barda, and to dominate and defeat her. Zazzala's sister, Tazzala, presumably had similar abilities. The Queen Bee of Bialya had no superhuman powers or abilities, aside from her beauty and cunning. Her sister Beatriz was also an ordinary human, but was nowhere as resourceful as her sister. The sixth Queen has great psionic powers including telepathy, mind control, empathy, casting extremely realistic and complex illusions to distract others or trick people into seeing her differently, telekinesis, projecting harmful blasts of psionic energy and feeding off the mental energies of others to fuel her own powers. She also displayed some sort of healing factor, being able to reconstruct her entire body from scratch after she was blasted to pieces by the Psycho Pirate. Her intellect is also increased to the \\"12th level\\", courtesy of the psionic virus she is infected with by Brainiac. She has been described as a \\"world-class telepath\\" by Robin and has proven capable of controlling thousands of people at once without visibly straining herself. Other versions=Action Comics A different version of Queen Bee named Lisa Raven first appears in Action Comics #42 (November 1941). Lissa Raven was the daughter of a brilliant psychologist who specialized in the working of the brain. Her father invented a machine that removes all worry from a person's thoughts. Lissa made herself the test subject, but something went wrong. The device robbed her of a conscience, turning her into a criminal. She started calling herself the \\"Queen Bee\\", and became an opponent to Mr. America. In her brief, colorful criminal career, Queen Bee used such amazing weapons as a giant robot and a mob of undead Vikings. Eventually, her father built another machine that would change Lissa back to normal. Afterward, she had no memory of her criminal activities, so Mr. America let her stay with her dad rather than arrest her. Quality Universe An alternate Queen Bee appears in Blackhawk #38 (March 1951). Queen Bee was the leader of an organization called \\"The Golden Swarm\\".

Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Queen Bee was part of a team led by the Canterbury Cricket to fight the Amazons which ended in failure with the demise of every bug hero except the Canterbury Cricket.Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket one-shot (June 2011) Mystik U Melissa, aka Queen Bee, is a bee- creature sorceress, and is the founder of the Thriae Society sorority at Mystik University. In her previous year (or years) on campus she had grown a large following of brainwashed thralls by giving them cocktails that transformed them into worker-bee like subjects who worshipped her. Melissa was defeated when she tried to turn Zatanna into a \\"Queen Maker\\" bee by feeding her magik-laced honey, only to be stopped by Zatanna's friends, who then unintentionally set The Malevolence upon her and her \\"hive\\". In other media=TelevisionLive action= * A character with similar powers named Sasha Woodman appeared in the Smallville episode \\"Drone\\" played by Shonda Farr and in \\"Cure\\" by Jovanna Huguet. She was able to control bees and used them to attack opposing candidates for student president before Clark stopped her. She was killed in the seventh season by Dr. Curtis Knox. *A character who shares some similarity with Queen Bee appears in The Flash and Arrow, portrayed by Emily Kinney. First appearing in The Flash season one episode \\"All Star Team Up\\", Brie Larvan was fired from her position at Mercury Labs by Tina McGee when fellow scientists Lindsay Kang and Bill Carlisle discovered that Brie intended to weaponize her project rather than use it for agricultural purposes. Growing bitter at this, Larvan plans her revenge on the three of them. She manages to kill Kang and Carlisle with robotic bees with stingers containing apitoxin, and she is nicknamed the \\"Bug-Eyed Bandit\\" by Cisco Ramon and Ray Palmer. Larvan's attempt to kill McGee is thwarted when Palmer uses his exo-suit to lure the bees over water to disable their circuitry. With help from Felicity Smoak, Flash then tracks Larvan to her base and captures her. Larvan returns in the Arrow season four episode \\"Beacon of Hope\\". Imprisoned in Iron Heights, she uses her court-sanctioned computer time to change her prison release date to March 29, 2016. Diagnosed with a tumor on her spine, one which will render her paraplegic once removed, she takes Palmer Tech's board members hostage using improved robotic bee drones to force Felicity Smoak into turning over schematics to the prototype microchip that allows her to walk after being paralyzed herself. Curtis Holt hacks the bees, commanding them to sting Larvan with the overdose of apitoxin from the stings leaving her in a coma. She is taken by SCPD and put in Starling General Hospital to be treated. Larvan returns in The Flash season five episode \\"Gone Rogue\\", where she teams up with Rag Doll and Weather Witch as a new version of the Rogues. After attempting to force the Flash into revealing his true identity, they are apprehended by the Flash and his team. =Animation= * In Justice League Unlimited, Queen Bee (apparently in her Zazzala incarnation) is seen as a background member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society in the third- season premiere, but she does not make a full appearance in the series. However, in the episode \\"Far From Home\\", Supergirl fights robotic duplicates of Zazzala and Doctor Cyber for training purposes. The \\"real\\" animated Queen Bee has thus far only appeared in a major role in the Justice League Unlimited comic (issue #29), in which she is the primary villain. She is defeated by the combined efforts of Animal Man and B'wana Beast. * Gail Simone has revealed that the teaser segment to her Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Mask of Matches Malone!\\" was supposed to feature Queen Bee as the main antagonist. However, due to issues with the runtime, the segment was shortened and rewritten to feature Poison Ivy instead. Nonetheless, a draft of the original short featuring Queen Bee was made available on Simone's message board.WAY Too Long Brave And The Bold Excerpt * The Bialyan Queen Bee appears in Young Justice voiced by Marina Sirtis. According to Greg Weisman, the Bialyan Queen Bee used in this show is the first Bialyan Queen Bee.Search Ask Greg : Gargoyles : Station Eight According to Batman, this Queen Bee possesses the ability of persuasion over most men and some women. She was referenced multiple times as the episode \\"Bereft\\" took place in Bialya. In \\"Revelation\\", it is revealed that Queen Bee is L-4 of The Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). In \\"Image\\", Queen Bee convinces Quraci President Rumaan Harjavti that Qurac and Bialya used to be one country (later revealed to be Psimon manipulating Harjavti). Queen Bee's soldiers move their way through the Logan Reserve causing a wildebeest stampede only to be halted by the team in their stealth mode. One of Queen Bee's jets end up attacking the Logan Reserve injuring Marie Logan's son Garfield while he was releasing a sick oryx and an injured wildebeest from the barn. When Robin and Superboy catch up to Rumaan Harjavti, they are attacked by Bialyan soldiers using Apokoliptan technology. The next day, Rumaan Harjavti tells Queen Bee that he has changed his mind about giving up Qurac to Bialya. Queen Bee is taken away vowing to get revenge on Qurac. This was later revealed to be an act by Miss Martian (who was imitating Queen Bee to make her scheme public knowledge before she imitated Bruce Wayne to meet with Rumaan Harjavti). Miss Martian later finds Queen Bee in Garfield Logan's room and states to Miss Martian that Psimon isn't the only one who knows what Miss Martian really is and that she'd better cooperate with her if she doesn't want the rest of the team to know her true form. She also states that should any of her team attack her personally or should she command it that Garfield would physically hurt himself to protect her. In \\"Usual Suspects\\", Queen Bee accompanies Lex Luthor, Sportsmaster, Bane, and Blockbuster to Santa Prisca. Miss Martian is also summoned by Queen Bee.

In \\"Beneath\\", Queen Bee was shown learning that the shipment of runaway children that Psimon, Icicle Jr., Mammoth, Shimmer, and Devastation were guarding were stopped by the female members of the Team. She isn't worried since they had a second shipment of runaway children that will be delivered to The Light's Partner. In \\"Intervention\\", Queen Bee learns about what happened in her lair and gives Mammoth, Shimmer, and Devastation her sympathies. Queen Bee then states that the Light's plans for the Reach, the Justice League, and the Team may proceed ahead of schedule.

They speak the Paiwan language. In 2014, the Paiwan numbered 96,334. This was approximately 17.8% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the second-largest indigenous group. The majority of Paiwan people live in the southern chain of the Central Mountain Range, from Damumu Mountain and the upper Wuluo River in the north of the southern chain to the Hengchun Peninsula in the south of it, and also in the hills and coastal plains of southeastern Taiwan. There are two subgroups under the Paiwan people: the Raval and the Butsul. The unique ceremonies in Paiwan are Masaru and Maleveq. The Masaru is a ceremony that celebrates the harvest of rice, whereas the Maleveq commemorates their ancestors or gods. History A Paiwan family house in Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village. Japanese rule of Taiwan taken by Torii Ry≈´z≈ç. Note the non- traditional Chinese attire The name \\"Paiwan\\" may have originated from a myth. According to the myth, Paiwan ancestors lived in a location on Dawu mountain that was called \\"Paiwan\\", where heaven is said to exist. Paiwan people have spread out from this location, so the name of the original place was assumed as their group name. According to some group members, \\"Paiwan\\" also means \\"human being\\". Taiwan in 1901, with the Paiwan marked as \\"Paiwan Group of Savages\\" on the southern tip of the island. One of the most important figures in Paiwan history was supreme chief Tok-a-Tok (1874),See also his article on the Chinese Wikipedia. who united 18 tribes of Paiwan under his rule, and after defeating American Marines during the Formosa Expedition in 1867 he concluded a formal agreement with Chinese and Western leaders to ensure the safety of foreign ships landing on their coastal territories in return for amnesty for Paiwan tribesmen who had killed the crew of the barque Rover in March 1867 (see Rover incident). In the past, the Paiwan had a fearsome reputation as head-hunters. When Paiwan warriors returned home from a headhunting foray, \\"the women would gather together in front of the courtyard to welcome their heroes and would sing songs of triumph. The heads of their enemies were then hung on stone pillars in front of which were displayed wine and offerings. The sacrificial rite started, and the soul of the dead was duly consoled by the sorcerer. A tuft of hair was removed from the skull and solemnly put in a basket which was used for divination.\\" In 1871, a Ry≈´ky≈´an vessel shipwrecked on the southern tip of Taiwan, and 54 of the 66 survivors were beheaded by the Paiwan aborigines (Mudan Incident). When Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that Taiwan's \\"raw\\" or \\"wild\\" natives () were outside its jurisdiction. This perceived renunciation of sovereignty led to the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1874 in which chief Tok-a-Tok was killed in action. During the Chinese Civil War, between 1946 and 1949, many Paiwan men were forcibly enlisted in the Kuomintang forces. When the war ended, some of the Paiwan remained behind in China and formed their own communities. Tsai Ing-wen, elected as President of Taiwan in 2016, is 1/4 Paiwan via her grandmother. Customs Unlike other peoples in Taiwan, Paiwan society is divided into classes with a hereditary aristocracy. The Paiwan are not allowed to marry outside their group. On the day of their \\"five-yearly rite,\\" all marriage-seeking Paiwan men try to cut down as many trees as possible and offer the firewood thus procured to the family of the girl they want to marry. Tattooed hands are a tradition of both Paiwan and Rukai peoples. Noble women used to receive these tattoos as a rite of passage into adulthood. However, since the Japanese colonial era, the practice has been less common as it was discouraged and fined during that time. In the tradition, shamans would tattoo hands in different patterns for different personal backgrounds. Less noble women could have received it, but they had to pay a hefty price on top of inviting all members of the community to a banquet with the purpose of gaining the community's approval. Less noble women had different tattoo designs than noblewomen. The painful tattooing process represented dignity and honor and the suffering that one could endure. The tattooing process lasts as long as it needs to with consideration for many taboos and nuances, such as praying. For example, pregnant women were not allowed to watch the process and no one watching was allowed to sneeze. If any taboos were broken, the ritual would be put off until another day chosen. In February 2015, Li Lin, the oldest Paiwan with hand tattoos, died at the age of 102. Li Lin had her hand tattoos starting at the age of 14 before marrying a village head as a common girl. She played a large role in promoting the cultural art form and continues to be an icon of cultural identity even in her death. Religion Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village. Traditionally the Paiwan have been polytheists. Their wooden carvings included images of human heads, snakes, deer, and geometric designs. In Taiwan, the Bataul branch of the Paiwan peoples holds a major sacrifice ‚Äì called maleveq ‚Äì every five years to invite the spirits of their ancestors to come and bless them. Djemuljat is an activity in the Maleveq in which the participants thrust bamboo poles into cane balls symbolizing human heads. Shamanism Shamanism has been described as an important part of Paiwan culture. Paiwan shamanism is traditionally seen as being inherited by blood-line. However, a decline in the number of Paiwan shamans has raised concerns that traditional rituals might be lost; and has led to the founding of a shamanism school to pass on the rituals to a new generation. Christianity Christianity first came to the Paiwan people in the seventeenth century, when Taiwan was occupied by the Dutch. More than 5,000 tribesmen became Christians after only ten years, but all of them were massacred in 1661 when Koxinga occupied Taiwan. The missionaries were either killed or driven away, and the churches were destroyed. Thousands of Paiwan people in Taiwan came to Christianity in the late 1940s and 1950s, sometimes whole villages. Today the Presbyterian church in Taiwan claims 14,900 Paiwan members, meeting in 96 congregations. The New Testament has been translated into Paiwan. The Catholic Church is also very active. The number of young people attending though is falling. Heritage In May 2015, two Paiwan totem poles were listed as ROC national treasures by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage under the Ministry of Culture. Both of these artifacts were acquired by the National Taiwan University during the Japanese colonial period (1895‚Äì1945). They were submitted for national treasure listing earlier in 2015. The Paiwan language is one of Taiwan's 42 indigenous tongues and dialects, being one of nine that are listed as vulnerable on the UNESCO atlas of endangered languages.

The Meghna River () is one of the major rivers in Bangladesh, one of the three that form the Ganges Delta, the largest delta on earth, which fans out to the Bay of Bengal. A part of the Surma-Meghna River System, Meghna is formed inside Bangladesh in Kishoreganj District above the town of Bhairab Bazar by the joining of the Surma and the Kushiyara, both of which originate in the hilly regions of eastern India as the Barak River. The Meghna meets its major tributary, the Padma, in Chandpur District. Other major tributaries of the Meghna include the Dhaleshwari, the Gumti, and the Feni. The Meghna empties into the Bay of Bengal in Bhola District via four principal mouths, named Tetulia (Ilsha), Shahbazpur, Hatia, and Bamni. Boat in Meghna River The Meghna is the widest river among those that flow completely inside the boundaries of Bangladesh. At a point near Bhola, Meghna is 13 km wide. In its lower reaches, this river's path is almost perfectly straight. Course The Meghna is formed due to the confluence of the Surma and Kushiyara rivers originating from the hilly regions of eastern India. Down to Chandpur, Meghna is hydrographically referred to as the Upper Meghna. After the Padma joins, it is referred to as the Lower Meghna. Near Muladhuli in Barisal district, the Safipur River is an offshoot of the Surma that creates one of the main rivers in South Bengal. 1.5 km wide, this river is one of the widest in the country as well. At Chatalpar of Brahmanbaria District, the river Titas emerges from Meghna and after circling two large bends by a distance of about , falls into the Meghna again near Nabinagar Upazila. The Titas forms as a single stream but braids into two distinct streams that remain separate before re-joining the Meghna. A view of the Meghna from a bridge In Daudkandi, (Comilla District), the Meghna is joined by the Gumti River, which increases the Meghna's water flow considerably. The pair of bridges over the Meghna and Gumti are two of the country's largest bridges. Meghna is reinforced by the Dhaleshwari before Chandpur. Further down, the Padma River- the largest distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh, along with the Jamuna River- the largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, join with the Meghna in Chandpur District, resulting in the Lower Meghna. After Chandpur, the combined flow of the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna moves down to the Bay of Bengal in an almost straight line, braiding occasionally into a number of riverines including the Pagli, Katalia, Dhonagoda, Matlab, and Udhamodi. All of these rivers rejoin the Meghna at different points downstream. Near Bhola, just before flowing into the Bay of Bengal, the river again divides into two main streams in the Ganges delta and separates an island from both sides of the mainland. The western stream is called Ilsha while the eastern one is called Bamni. They form the largest delta named Ganges delta.

The station uses the on-air brand name C100. It was owned by Toronto based CHUM Limited until that company's buy-out by CTVglobemedia in 2007, and then Bell Media in 2011. CIOO's studios are located at the intersection of Russell and Agricola Streets in Halifax (right behind sister station CJCH-DT), with its transmitter located on Washmill Lake Drive in Clayton Park. CIOO-FM competed with CKUL-FM until it switched to soft adult contemporary in 2019. History In 1976, Radio 920, Ltd., a division of CHUM Limited, applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for a new FM radio station broadcasting at 100,000 watts with a dial position of 100.1 MHz. This would be the third FM radio station in Halifax after FM stations CBH-FM and CHFX-FM. Radio 920, Ltd. also owned CTV affiliate CJCH-TV and CJCH-AM. The CRTC subsequently approved the application. On November 1, 1977, CIOO began broadcasting as an easy listening station. As a new decade approached, CIOO changed its programming format to album rock. This gave the listeners an opportunity to hear more than just the top 40 hits from a particular artist, such as other songs not yet on AM radio. In 1983, CHUM Limited tested a simulcast project. A new TV station, ASN, had aired in the province. Together with CIOO, they would air Atlantic Canada's Choice - a radio/TV program, hosted by Geoff Banks, counting down the week's best albums from 20 to 1. This lasted until spring 1985, where the station again reformatted its programming. The spring of 1985 saw the station take on another programming angle, Top 40 along with oldies, such as the Beach Boys among others. This format was phased out not long after, when the station moved towards adult contemporary. The station ran such slogans as \\"Lite Rock...Less Talk\\", \\"Great Light Rock Hits\\" and \\"...Even More Lite Rock Hits\\". CIOO moved to its current Hot AC format in 1993. Like most Hot AC stations in Canada, CIOO leans rhythmic, though not as heavy as sister station CHUM-FM/Toronto. With sister station CJCH-FM adopting a Rhythmic/Dance Top 40 presentation by 2013, CIOO has modified its playlist towards a conventional Adult Top 40 direction. New sister stations since 2013 are Truro-based CKTY-FM and CKTO-FM. Features * The Breakfast Club is the weekday morning program on C100. The show airs from 6:30am‚Äì10:00am, having extended from its old hours of 6:00am‚Äì9:00am. It was originally hosted by Kelly Latremouille, Peter Harrison and Moya Farrell until mid-2007. Latremouille had debuted with the station in the summer of 1993, replacing John Biggs, who took Latremouille's position with 92 CJCH AM at that time.

Life as a Samurai Fukushima was born to a samurai family; his father was a retainer to the daimy≈ç of Matsumoto, in Shinano Province (modern Nagano Prefecture). He also became a retainer of Lord Toda Mitsunori. In 1867 he traveled to Edo (later Tokyo) to attend the Kobusho military school for hatamoto located in Tsukiji. During the Boshin War (1868‚Äì1869), he saw service as a member of the Matsumoto contingent. In 1869, with Lord Toda, he again traveled to Tokyo and studied foreign languages at the Kaisei Gakko, a school specializing in foreign studies. After graduating the school in 1874, he joined the Ministry of Justice as a civilian personnel and later moved to the Ministry of War. He participated in the government forces in the Satsuma Rebellion (1877). His quick mind and ability to get along well with people earned him a posting at the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff at an early age. Early foreign travels During the next years, he traveled extensively, visiting Mongolia in 1879, serving as military attach√© to Beijing from 1882-1884. He was a staff officer of the Japanese First Army when the First Sino-Japanese War broke out. After the war, Fukushima visited British India and Burma on an extensive tour from 1886-1887. In 1887, he was promoted to major, and sent as military attach√© to Berlin. On this trip in 1892, he was accompanied by Prince Saionji Kinmochi. Fukushima, who spoke 10 languages fluently, was a popular figure in German society during his stay in Berlin. Fukushima made a reputation during his stay in Berlin, for winning all manner of wagers involving feats of arms or physical strength. He later claimed that the reason for his long ride across Russia was a wager made over drinks against some German cavalry majors. (The story is probably an invention, as some historians claim that Fukushima never drank alcohol, and in any case it is not recorded whether or not Fukushima ever collected on the wager). In any case, Fukushima was an admirer of Colonel Burnaby, a British cavalry officer, who had made an epic ride to Khiva in 1874 after receiving word that the Russians had closed the border to Turkistan. Fukushima also shared Burnaby's political views that Russia was the chief enemy of both Great Britain and Japan. Epic horseback ride For his return to Japan, he chose to make an epic crossing of two continents on horseback, from Berlin to Vladivostok. The trip took one year and four months, and had as one of its objectives, inspecting the construction of the still under construction Trans-Siberian Railway as well as gathering intelligence of the local infrastructure, command and control, along the way. During this journey, on 1 March 1893 prior to entering Manchuria, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The story of his 14,000 kilometer ride made him a Japanese national hero, and earned him the Order of the Sacred Treasures, third class. After his return to Japan from his ride across Asia, Fukushima donated his horses to Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, where they quickly became famous tourist attractions. Service during the Boxer Rebellion Fukushima subsequently saw service in the Boxer Rebellion (1900), where he was in command of Japanese forces in Tianjin, as well as the Foreign Legation. Afterwards, he returned briefly to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy to study under the German General Jakob Meckel. Further travels and foreign honors As a General Staff officer after the war, he visited Egypt, Ottoman Turkey, Persia, Arabia, India, Burma, Siam and Turkistan. In 1902, he represented Emperor Meiji at the coronation of King Edward VII of Great Britain, and participated in secret diplomatic negotiations behind the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. He was awarded an honorary Knight-Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) and Order of Prince Danilo I. During the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) Fukushiama traveled through Saskatchewan, Canada on the way to New York for the purpose of negotiating financial assistance for the war. He stopped his special train just east of Regina, Saskatchewan to view the prairies. The siding where he stopped was named Fukushiama in his honour. Honors in Japan Fukushima also served with distinction in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895), and in the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905). In 1907, Fukushima was elevated to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. From April 26, 1912 to September 15, 1914, he served as the Governor-General of Kwantung Leased Territory. In 1914, he was promoted to general and was transferred to the second reserve. After the transfer, he served as vice-president of the Association of Reservists. Poetry and death Fukushima was on good terms with fellow poet General Akashi Motojiro, and although not close friends, the two men shared ideas on the long term needs of the Japanese secret services in the Asian area. Fukushima even composed a poem titled \\"From Fallen Petal to Rising Star\\", in which he honored a prostitute who became a patriot through her intelligence-gathering activities. Fukushima died at age 67 and his grave is located at Aoyama Cemetery, Tokyo. The Matsumoto City Museum in Matsumoto, Nagano, preserves some of his personal artifacts, including his riding crop.

She was named for Whidbey Island, in Puget Sound, Washington, the location of NAS Whidbey Island; the name ultimately derives from the sailor, explorer and engineer Joseph Whidbey. Whidbey Island was laid down on 4 August 1981, by the Lockheed Shipbuilding, Seattle, Wa.; launched on 10 June 1983, sponsored by Mrs. Sally Gorton, wife of Senator Slade Gorton; and commissioned on 9 February 1985. History In February 1981, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Shipbuilding Company of Seattle, Washington, a contract to construct LSD 41, first of a new Dock Landing Ship class to replace the aging Thomaston-class LSDs. At the 4 August 1981 keel-laying ceremony, the Honorable John F. Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, affixed his signature to the LSD 41 keel; the first keel of an amphibious assault ship lain in more than five years. Although the first ship to carry the name Whidbey Island, there was at one time a ship named USS Whidbey (AG-141), a small transport purchased from the U.S. Army and servicing U.S. Trust Territories in the late 1940s. Whidbey Island, the first ship in a class designed specifically to interface with the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), assisted in the operational and developmental testing of the amphibious assault craft from July to September 1985 and again in May and July 1986. 1986 ‚Äì 1991 In August 1986, Whidbey Island embarked on her first major operation, participating in the NATO Exercise Northern Wedding/Bold Guard '86. Whidbey Islands first deployment was to the Mediterranean in January 1987. The ship took part in seven amphibious exercises carrying out duties as Presidential Support Ship for the World Economic Summit in Venice, Italy, May 1987. Whidbey Island deployed to the Mediterranean for the second time in December 1988 with MARG 1-89, participating in three major landing exercises with the Spanish, French and Italian Navies before returning to homeport in June 1989. Whidbey Island was the first amphibious ship from the East Coast to deploy to the European Theater with LCACs. In September and October 1989, Whidbey Island participated in Hurricane Hugo disaster relief operations in the Caribbean. In August 1990, Whidbey Island again deployed to the Mediterranean as part of MARG 3-90. During the trans-Atlantic crossing, the ship received orders to sail to Mamba Station off the coast of Monrovia, Liberia, serving as the flagship for evacuation operations in Operation Sharp Edge, spending 105 consecutive days at sea. By the time Whidbey Island reached her first port, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, the ship had been out to sea for 126 straight days. After further steaming around the Western Mediterranean in support of Operation Desert Storm, Whidbey Island returned to homeport March 1991 from her extended seven- month deployment. 1992 ‚Äì 1997 On 5 December 1991 Whidbey Island deployed with MARG 1-92 representing the Amphibious Ready Group's operations in the Black Sea with a series of port calls. With members of the Sixth Fleet, the Band, and representatives from the other MARG ships, Whidbey Island made port calls to Samsun, Turkey; Constan≈£a, Romania; and Burgas, Bulgaria, becoming the first United States amphibious ship and the largest U.S. warship to operate in the Black Sea, the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Samsun in 70 years and the first U.S. Navy ship to ever visit Burgas. Whidbey Island returned to homeport on 5 June 1992. In January 1993, Whidbey Island deployed in support of Operation Sea Signal/Able Manner, enforcing alien migration policies off the coast of Haiti. Later that year, Whidbey Island deployed to the littorals of South America and West Africa during UNITAS 34-93/WATC 93, the first Whidbey Island-class ship to deploy to this region, leading the southernmost amphibious exercise ever at Tierra del Fuego, returning from deployment 17 December 1993. In August 1994, in a Combined Joint Task Force Whidbey Island provided emergent lift services for the evacuation of 160 migrant camps from Grand Turk Island. Shortly after, Whidbey Island rescued and transported over 8,100 Cuban migrants from the Straits of Florida during Operation Able Vigil and participated in the restoration of the legitimate government to Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. At the turn of 1995, Whidbey Island along with and participated in NATO cold weather training in the North Atlantic for Exercise Strong Resolve 95. On 28 August 1995, Whidbey Island deployed for a fifth Mediterranean Deployment with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). During this deployment, the ship participated in Exercises Atlas Hinge, Odysseus 95, Noble Shirley, Bright Star and Alexander the Great, spending over three months in the Adriatic Sea in support of peacekeeping operations for the Dayton Peace Accords in the former Yugoslavia. The crew received the Armed Forces Service Medal and the NATO Medal, returning to homeport 29 February 1996. On 3 June 1996, Whidbey Island entered Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (NORSHIPCO) for a Dry-docking Phased Maintenance Availability (DPMA) and received a Women at Sea Certification. On 1 July 1997, Whidbey Island departed for Unitas 38-97 setting a record for amphibious landings with several UNITAS participating nations before returning home 13 December 1997. 1999 ‚Äì 2002 Whidbey Island departed for her sixth Mediterranean deployment 15 September 1999. Along with 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, Whidbey Island participated in Exercises Bright Star, Noble Shirley and Infinite Moonlight. During these exercises the ship worked in partnership with members of the British, Egyptian and Jordanian Armed Forces. Whidbey Island safely transited the Suez Canal as well as the Straits of Tiran, Toranto, Gibraltar, and of Messina, visiting ports such as Alicante, Spain; Antalya, Turkey; Haifa, Israel; Palermo, Italy; Genoa, Italy; Souda Bay, Greece; and Aqaba, Jordan. On 24 May 2000, Whidbey Island returned to NORSHIPCO for multiple upgrades and additions to the ship's configuration and systems. During this PMA period the ship received two Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM) Launchers as well as the Ship's Self Defense System (SSDS) Mk-1, significantly enhancing Whidbey Islands ability to track, engage and destroy incoming missiles at close range. On 11 June 2001, Whidbey Island completed her Basic Phase of Training and started a five-week pre-deployment maintenance period. Starting 11 July 2001 the ship began her intermediate training cycle in preparation for deployment as part of Amphibious Squadron 8, Amphibious Ready Group. On 19 September 2001, just eight days after the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, Whidbey Island weighed anchor for her seventh deployment. With troops of 26th MEU (Special Operations Capable), the ship participated in Exercise Bright Star off the coast of Egypt. At the completion of the exercise, crew and troops enjoyed a few days in the port of Marmaris, Turkey, before transiting the Suez Canal en route to the North Persian Gulf. While there, Whidbey Island spent 123 consecutive days on station in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this operation, 26th MEU set the record for conducting the longest amphibious operation ever (distance-wise)‚Äînearly 700 nautical miles (1300 km) inland. While deployed, Whidbey Islands crew visited Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates; Split, Croatia; and Rota, Spain. The ship also participated in the National Training Continuum, Operations Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Swift Freedom. 2006 ‚Äì 2007 In June 2006, Whidbey Island deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While inport Aqaba, Jordan in July 2006, she was recalled through the Suez Canal to support contingency operations due to the crisis in Lebanon. Whidbey Island subsequently participated in the largest Non-Combatant Evacuation conducted by the U.S. Navy since Vietnam. During July and August, she evacuated 817 American citizens, out of a total of 14,555 evacuated by the Expeditionary Strike Group, via Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) with Personnel Transport Module. AMCITS were taken to Limassol, Cyprus and released to State Department Control. Following operations off of Lebanon, Whidbey Island redeployed through the Suez Canal to the Fifth Fleet Operations Area and offloaded elements of the 24 MEU into Bahrain for operations in Iraq. Following the offload, Whidbey Island deployed to the Northern Persian Gulf in support of Commander Task Force 158, responsible as an Afloat Forward Staging Base. In this role, she was responsible for defense of the KAAOT and ABOT oil rigs, the primary critical oil infrastructure producing revenue for Iraq. In November 2006, Whidbey Island departed the Northern Persian Gulf and returned home, stopping in Civitavecchia, Italy and Tunis, Tunisia en route, arriving 6 December 2006. On 16 February 2007, Whidbey Island was awarded the 2006 Battle \\"E\\" award.BattleE On 1 October 2007, Whidbey Island deployed from Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base. After being deployed to the Horn of Africa, she assisted the Comorian vessel MV Al Marjan and her crew when they were released by Somali pirates on 2 December 2007. 2008 ‚Äì 2009 On 11 January 2008, the US Navy reported that Whidbey Island had fired warning shots near a small Iranian boat in the Strait of Hormuz in December. The boat was reportedly approaching Whidbey Island rapidly but stopped after the warning shots were fired. Ship's Coat of Arms The dark blue and white colors refer to the sea, with the angular green area, representing the evergreen terrain of Whidbey Island, backed by blue sky. The color gold is symbolic of excellence, and the ship's wheel of gold reflects the seagoing pride and professionalism of the ship's crew. The green Maltese Cross refers to the humanitarian mission of the USS Whidbey (AG 141), the first ship to carry the name Whidbey. The gold crown emblazoned on red at the center of the wheel recalls the expedition under the British Crown, which explored the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s. The island in these waters is named for Lieutenant Joseph Whidbey, who was a member of this English expedition. The crossed swords of the Navy and Marine Corps officers attest to the Navy Marine Corps teamwork and leadership that are the foundation and key elements for accomplishment of Whidbey Island's amphibious warfare mission. The trident is the traditional symbol of sea power; however, the winged trident of LSD-41 further represents the revolutionary dimension of amphibious warfare this ship introduces. The gold and red colors of the winged trident portray the excellence and courage of those who will man the ship. The wreath of Western Hemlock, the State Tree of Washington, represents the spirit of the ship's namesake.

She was the first Egyptian woman as well as the first woman from Arab world to earn a pilot's license. Early life Lotfia Elnadi was born on 29 October 1907 into an upper-class family in Cairo. After completion of her primary education, it was expected that she would marry, becoming a housewife and mother. Her father, who worked for the government printing office, Matbaa Amiriya, saw no reason for Elnadi to pursue secondary education. Her mother encouraged her to attend the American College with its modern curriculum and focus as a language school. Elnadi read an article about a flying school which had just opened in Cairo and determined that she would attend, despite her father's objections. Initially she approached a journalist to assist her, but when he refused, she went directly to the director of EgyptAir, Kamal Elwi, asking for assistance. He saw the potential for publicity and agreed to help. As Elnadi had no way to pay for the flying lessons, she worked as the secretary and telephone operator for the flying school in exchange for her tuition. Flying career Telling her father that she was attending a bi-weekly study group, Elnadi instead took flight lessons, along with 33 other male classmates. When Elnadi earned her pilot‚Äôs licence, on 27 September 1933, she became the first African as well as Arab woman pilot in the world, after only 67 days of study. Initially her father was angry, but seeing the favorable press Elnadi received, his anger dissipated and he allowed her to take him on a flight over the pyramids. Her achievement made headlines throughout the world.Lotfia Elnadi in a plane, 1933. On 19 December 1933, Elnadi flew in the international race between Cairo and Alexandria. Flying at speeds averaging 100 miles per hour, she steered her single-engine plane to the finish-line before any of the other competitors. She received a prize of 200 Egyptian pounds and the congratulations of King Fuad for her attempt. Huda Sha'arawi, a feminist leader, also sent salutations for the inspiration Elnadi provided and then held a fundraising drive to buy Elnadi a plane of her own. Elnadi worked as the secretary general of the Egyptian Aviation Club and flew for about five years before she was injured in an accident which damaged her spine. Following Elnadi‚Äôs example, for around a decade other Egyptian woman attended flight training and became pilots. With the coming of the World War, no other women pilots trained after 1945, until Dina-Carole El Sawy became a pilot for EgyptAir. Later life After the flying accident, Elnadi, went to obtain medical treatment in Switzerland and remained there for many years. In 1989, she was invited back to Cairo to participate in the 54th anniversary of civil aviation in the country, where she received the Order of Merit of the Egyptian Organization of Aerospace Education. In 1996, a documentary film, Take Off From the Sand, was produced telling her story. In her 80s, she moved to Toronto, Canada to live with her nephew and his family for several years before moving to Cairo in her late 80s. She never married and died in Cairo in 2002.

The company is also a distiller and is the major producer of rum in Trinidad and Tobago. The company also has been used as a vehicle for international expansion by its parent company, CL Financial. As a result of these acquisitions, the company owns distillers in the United States, Canada, The Bahamas and Suriname.  History  The company was founded around 1830 in the Venezuelan town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bol√≠var) by a German doctor, Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, Surgeon-General in Simon Bolivar's army in Venezuela. Around 1820 he had tried to find a medicine to improve appetite and digestive well-being of the soldiers. In 1830, Siegert exported his unique aromatic bitters to England and Trinidad. By 1850, he had resigned his commission in the Venezuelan army to concentrate on the manufacture of his bitters, since by then demand had leapt ahead of supply. In 1862 the product was exhibited and sampled in London, to great approval. Upon his death in 1870, Siegert left the care of the company to his younger brother and son, who subsequently moved it to Port of Spain, Trinidad six years later in 1876. Over the course of time, Angostura bitters and Dr. Siegert's company alone became purveyor to the King of Prussia, Spain, and King George V. Today, angostura bitters are also produced by various other vendors, some of which add the bark of the angostura tree (Angostura trifoliata). Angostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails, for example in pink gin and the Manhattan. Angostura brand bitters do not contain any angostura bark. There are several other companies that make bitters containing this bark, notably Fee Brothers and Riemerschmid. The word \\"Angostura\\" (lit. \\"Narrows\\") is the founding name of Ciudad Bol√≠var along the narrows of Venezuela's Orinoco River where Dr. Siegert was based. It was an important trading town with river access to the sea. In December 2016 questions arose regarding the integrity of Angostura rum, with CEO Robert Wong sent on administrative leave for two months. Reports say Angostura breached EU rules of origin laws by purchasing bulk rum and repackaging it, without making any substantial changes.

Ink Unlike with most permanent markers the ink is an oil-based paint and generally requires shaking before use, similar to an aerosol spray paint can. In addition, the line is very opaque and, unlike spirit-based or other permanent inks, will not fade with exposure to UV light, and overlays all other colors beneath it. The paint from these types of markers is not truly permanent, as it can be removed using high pressure cleaning or paint thinning solvents such as acetone. Dangers Paint markers, and permanent markers generally, contain the toxic compounds xylene or toluene. Like spray paint, these markers give off volatile organic compounds, which can be dangerous when not used in a well ventilated area or with a particulate mask. Gloves can also be worn to avoid absorption through the skin. Solidified paint pens Another type of paint marker is the solidified paint pen. This is a type of marker, often contained within a twist tube, that is a cylinder of semi-hardened oil-paint with a pointed tip. As one writes with it, the point wears down and must be advanced to in order to continue writing. The marker leaves a mark similar to that of chalk. It is useful for marking on wet or oily surfaces. It is sold under the brand name Mean Streak in the United States and generic versions are also available online. It is made by Sanford, the maker of Sharpies, but there are many different brands and types of solidified paint pens. Usage Paint pens are used for a variety of purposes. Their most general usage is on windows, and they are often used to advertise sales or discounts meant to bring prospective buyers in. Restaurants often hire a professional artist to \\"paint\\" with the markers on their windows. Another popular use is for tire lettering, where auto enthusiasts use the markers to customize the look of their tires. Paint Markers have gained more general usage in the arts and crafts community for a variety of uses. These uses include sign design, on photographs in scrap booking, on clothing, glass home goods, as well as traditional art and street art. When deciding what to use paint markers for, an artist should also consider this list of qualities of different paint marker brands: removability, odor, pigmentation, and drying time.

The film features an ensemble cast including Dwayne Johnson, Seann William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, and Justin Timberlake. Original music was provided by Moby. The film is an international co-production of the United States, Germany and France. The title refers to the Southland, a name used by locals to refer to Southern California and Greater Los Angeles. Set in the then-near future of 2008, the film is a portrait of Los Angeles, and a satiric commentary on the military‚Äìindustrial complex and the infotainment industry. Plot On July 4th, 2005, in a fictionalized United States alternate history reality, two towns in Texas (El Paso and Abilene) were destroyed by twin nuclear attacks, killing thousands and triggering a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, sending America into a state of anarchy and hysteria, as well as a Third World War (a fictionalized version of what the nation may have become under the War on Terror), with the US government re-introducing the draft. The PATRIOT Act has extended authority to a new agency known as US-IDent, which keeps constant surveillance on citizens‚Äîeven to the extent of censoring the Internet and requiring fingerprints to access computers and bank accounts. In response to the recent fuel shortage in the wake of global warfare, the German company Treer designs a generator of inexhaustible energy, which is propelled by the perpetual motion of ocean currents, called \\"Fluid Karma\\". However, its inventor Baron von Westphalen and his associates are hiding the fact that the generators alter the ocean's currents and cause the Earth to slow its rotation, and that the transmission of Fluid Karma to portable receivers (via quantum entanglement) is ripping holes in the fabric of space and time.

The film follows the criss-crossed destinies of Boxer Santaros, an action film actor stricken with amnesia; Krysta Now, a psychic ex-porn star in the midst of creating a reality TV show; and twin brothers Roland and Ronald Taverner, whose destinies become intertwined with that of all mankind. The Taverner twins are revealed to be the same person by the engineers of Treer, duplicated when Roland traveled through a rift in space-time, while Boxer has become the most wanted man in the world despite his political ties and his having the fate of the future, in the form of a prophetic screenplay foretelling the end of the world, in his hands. Cast * Dwayne Johnson as Boxer Santaros / Jericho Cane, an amnesiac action star whose life crosses paths with Krysta Now. Santaros is married to Madeline Frost Santaros. * Seann William Scott as Private Roland Taverner / Officer Ronald Taverner, identical twin brothers, one who is a kidnapped U.P.U.2 officer in Hermosa Beach, California, the other who is working for the neo-Marxist group who have told him he kidnapped and drugged his brother. * Sarah Michelle Gellar as Krysta Now / Krysta Lynn Kapowski, an adult film star who is working on creating a reality TV show.

He narrates the film and also mimes a musical number. * Miranda Richardson as Nana Mae Frost, the ambitious antagonist of the film, Boxer's mother-in-law is the head of US-IDent. * Wallace Shawn as Baron von Westphalen, a villain who utilizes ocean waves to create a source of power. He is the great-grandson of Jenny von Westphalen. * Bai Ling as Serpentine, the Baron's sultry girlfriend who is seen quite often through the film, she serves as an ambiguous character that knows more than she lets on. * Nora Dunn as Cyndi Pinziki, a porn director and principal member of USIDeath, an organization with plans to destroy US-IDent. * John Larroquette as Vaughn Smallhouse, an advisor to Senator Bobby Frost. * Kevin Smith as Simon Theory, a legless Iraq War veteran who works for Baron von Westphalen. Amy Poehler and Wood Harris appear as Neo-Marxist activists. Zelda Rubinstein and Beth Grant portray Dr. Katarina Kuntzler and Dr. Inga Von Westphalen, members of the baron's entourage. Janeane Garofalo appears as General Teena MacArthur. Jon Lovitz plays violent police officer Bart Bookman, while Holmes Osborne plays conservative Senator Bobby Frost. Will Sasso plays Fortunio Balducci. Production Kelly wrote Southland Tales shortly before the September 11 attacks. The original script involved blackmail, a porn star, and two cops. After the attacks, Kelly revised the script. He said, \\"[The original script] was more about making fun of Hollywood. But now it's about, I hope, creating a piece of science fiction that's about a really important problem we're facing, about civil liberties and homeland security and needing to sustain both those things and balance them.\\" He described the film as a \\"tapestry of ideas all related to some of the biggest issues that I think we're facing right now . . . alternative fuel or the increasing obsession with celebrity and how celebrity now intertwines with politics\\". With the film's premise of a nuclear attack on Texas, Kelly wanted to take a look at how the United States would respond and survive while constructing a \\"great black comedy.\\" Kelly's breakthrough film, Donnie Darko, was released in the United States on October 26, 2001, the same day the PATRIOT Act was signed. Two months before Southland Tales was released, he announced the launch of Darko Entertainment.\\"Kelly launches Darko Entertainment\\", by Dade Hayes, Variety Kelly said: \\"[Southland Tales] will only be a musical in a post-modern sense of the word in that it is a hybrid of several genres. There will be some dancing and singing, but it will be incorporated into the story in very logical scenarios as well as fantasy dream environments.\\" Kelly said the film's biggest influences are Kiss Me Deadly, Pulp Fiction, Brazil, and Dr. Strangelove. He called it a \\"strange hybrid of the sensibilities of Andy Warhol and Philip K. Dick\\". The film often references religious and literary works; a policeman says, \\"Flow my tears,\\" in reference to a Philip K. Dick novel of that name. (\\"Taverner\\" is the name of the main character in the same book and suffers identity problems of his own.) Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) quotes Biblical scripture from the Book of Revelation in narrating the film and allusion is made both to Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening and an altered version of T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men. Casting In March 2004, Kelly and Cherry Road Films began development of Southland Tales. Filmmakers entered negotiations with actors Seann William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Lee, Janeane Garofalo, Tim Blake Nelson, Amy Poehler, Kevin Smith, and Ali Larter. Musician Moby was approached on composing and performing the film's score. Kelly consciously sought out actors that he felt had been pigeonholed and wanted to showcase their \\"undiscovered talents.\\" Filming Filming was slated to begin in July 2004, but after a year, it had not begun. Dwayne Johnson joined the cast in April 2005, and principal photography was slated to begin August 1, 2005 in Los Angeles. Filming began on August 15, 2005, with a budget of around US$15‚Äì17 million. Post-production Kelly sent the organizers of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival a rough cut of Southland Tales on DVD assuming that it would not be accepted. Much to his surprise, they loved it and wanted the film entered in competition for the Palme d'Or. He stopped editing the film and was also unable to complete all of the visual effects in time for the screening. Kelly's film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 with a length of 160 minutes. Kelly describes the negative reaction at Cannes as a \\"very painful experience on a lot of levels\\" but ultimately felt that the film \\"was better off because of it\\". After the film's festival release, Southland Tales was purchased by Sony Pictures. Universal Studios had originally optioned the U.S. rights, but after the Cannes screening, it was sold to Sony, although Universal still retained some international rights. Kelly sought more financing to finish visual effects for the film, and he negotiated a deal with Sony to cut down on the film's length in exchange for funds to complete the visual effects. Kelly edited the film down to the basic storylines of the characters portrayed by Scott, Gellar, and Johnson. The director also sought to keep the musical number performed by Timberlake, based on \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" by The Killers which he felt was the heart and soul of the film. Editorial changes were made to restructure the order of the film's scenes, including re-recording all of Timberlake's voice-over. The director also added 90 new visual effects shots to the film and removed 20 to 25 minutes of footage from his initial cut.

Additionally, tracks from Radiohead, Louis Armstrong, Beethoven, Kris Kristofferson, and several tracks from Moby's Hotel:Ambient are likewise absent from the album. The reason for the exclusion of some of these tracks, like the song by The Killers was as a result of a dispute with the record label. The track \\"Memory Gospel\\" was used from time to time by the CBC Radio One program Q in the background of an opening monologue given by host Jian Ghomeshi. Release=Marketing Southland Tales was initially planned to be a nine-part \\"interactive experience\\", with the first six parts published in six 100-page graphic novels that would be released in a six-month period up to the film's release. The feature film comprises the final three parts of the experience. A website was also developed to intertwine with the graphic novels and the film itself. The idea of six graphic novels was later narrowed down to three. The novels were written by Kelly and illustrated by Brett Weldele. Kelly wrote them while making the film and found it very difficult as it pushed him \\"to the edge of my own sanity\\", as he remarked in an interview. * Part One: Two Roads Diverge (May 25, 2006, ) * Part Two: Fingerprints (September 15, 2006, ) * Part Three: The Mechanicals (January 31, 2007, ) They have been collected together into one single volume: * Southland Tales: The Prequel Saga (360 pages, Graphitti Designs, ) The titles of the parts in the film are: * Part Four: Temptation Waits * Part Five: Memory Gospel * Part Six: Wave of Mutilation Theatrical release Director Richard Kelly at a screening of Southland Tales The film premiered May 21, 2006, at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, where it was poorly received. After significant edits, the final version premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2007. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on November 9, 2007 in partnership with Destination Films and Samuel Goldwyn Films, but in eventually opened in limited release in California on November 14, 2007. It opened in Canada, as well as nationwide in the United States, in just 63 theaters, on November 16, 2007. The film was released in the UK on December 7, 2007 exclusively to UK cinema chain Cineworld in a limited number of locations. Home media The Region 1 DVD was released on March 18, 2008 in North America and the Region 2 release was on March 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom. The film was released on Region 4 DVD in Australia on April 30, 2008. Special features include a 33-minute documentary USIDent TV: Surveiling the Southland and a 10-minute animated short film This Is the Way the World Ends (which was not included on the R2 and R4 editions). On March 25, 2009, the R2 DVD was released in France. Kelly has claimed on his MySpace blog that he had very little time for the DVD as he was starting shooting on his next feature, The Box. However, he has stated several times that if Sony commissioned one (based on the sales of the current DVD), he would happily be involved in a \\"Director's Cut\\" DVD in the future with more special features and deleted scenes from the Cannes cut. On September 8, 2008, it was announced that it would be one of the five films being released on Blu-ray on November 18, 2008. The only new special feature announced was an audio commentary by Kelly. Reception=Box office Southland Tales grossed $275,380 in limited release at the North American box office and $99,363 in Turkey and United Kingdom for a worldwide total of $374,743, against a production budget of $17 million. Cannes Film Festival Along with two other American filmmakers (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette and Richard Linklater's Fast Food Nation), Kelly's follow-up to Donnie Darko was in competition for the coveted Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened on May 21 at the Grand Lumiere Theater. Many critics responded unfavorably to the film's long running time and sprawling nature. Roger Ebert described the Cannes screening as \\"The most disastrous since, yes, The Brown Bunny.\\" Salon.com critic Andrew O'Hehir called the Cannes cut \\"about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.\\" Jason Solomons, in The Observer (UK), said that \\"Southland Tales was so bad it made me wonder if [Kelly] had ever met a human being\\" and that ten minutes of the \\"sprawling, plotless, post-apocalyptic farrago\\" gave him the \\"sinking feeling that this may be one of the worst films ever presented in [Cannes] competition.\\" A handful of the American and European critics, however, were more positive.Links to many post-Cannes reviews, including multiple positive reviews by American, French, Spanish, Polish, and other reviewers. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, for example, called Southland Tales \\"a visionary film about the end of times\\" comparable in recent American film only to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Critical response , the film holds a 39% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 102 reviews with an average rating of 4.63 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \\"Southland Tales, while offering an intriguing vision of the future, remains frustratingly incoherent and unpolished.\\" On Metacritic, the film had a score of 44 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Glenn Kenny, in his review for Premiere criticized the film's style, \\"Kelly's camera placement and framing are at best textbook and at worst calamitously mediocre.\\" In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, \\"You get the sense that Kelly is too angry to really find any of it funny. It's easy to empathize with his position, not so easy to remain engrossed in a film that's occasionally inspired but ultimately manic and scattered.\\" David Edelstein's review in New York magazine criticized the film's writing, \\"Kelly aims high and must have shot off his own ear, which is the only way to account for the dialogue.\\" On the program Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips gave the film a negative review. While Roeper called the film \\"Two hours and twenty-four minutes of abstract crap,\\" Phillips felt that \\"the film has a head on its shoulders despite the fact that it can't find any direction\\" but nevertheless gave the film a thumbs down.Southland Tales review on the At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper website. J. Hoberman defended the film, yet again, in his review for the theatrical cut. \\"In its willful, self-involved eccentricity, Southland Tales is really something else. Kelly's movie may not be entirely coherent, but that's because there's so much it wants to say.\\" Manohla Dargis also gave the film a positive review in The New York Times, writing, \\"He doesn't make it easy to love his new film, which turns and twists and at times threatens to disappear down the rabbit hole of his obsessions. Happily, it never does, which allows you to share in his unabashed joy in filmmaking as well as in his fury about the times.\\" The film remains enigmatic to many viewers and even some of its makers. In a 2011 interview, Justin Timberlake himself said, \\"To me, Southland Tales is performance art. I still don't know what that movie is about [laughs].\\" In a 2013 interview, Kelly said he considered this work as \\"the thing that I'm most proud of, and I feel like it's sort of the misunderstood child or the banished child.\\" See also * List of American films of 2007 * 99 Francs * A Scanner Darkly and its film adaptation ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2006 films Category:American films Category:German films Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:2000s comedy- drama films Category:2000s dystopian films Category:2000s thriller films Category:American alternate history films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American thriller films Category:German alternate history films Category:German thriller films Category:French alternate history films Category:French thriller films Category:Films about amnesia Category:Apocalyptic films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Films directed by Richard Kelly Category:Films set in 2008 Category:Films set in California Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Independence Day (United States) films Category:Iraq War films Category:Metaphysical fiction films Category:Moby Category:Quantum fiction Category:Films about time travel Category:Utopian films Category:2006 comedy films Category:2006 drama films ","title":"Southland Tales"},{"id":"1498496","text":"250px The Six Mile Water is a river in southern County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It was historically called the (river) Ollar and is known in Irish as Abhainn na bhFiodh (river of the wood). The Six Mile Water is an indirect tributary of the River Bann, via Lough Neagh. It rises in the hills west of Larne and north of Carrickfergus and descends gently westward, flowing through or close to the communities of Ballynure, Ballyclare, Doagh, Parkgate, Templepatrick, Dunadry and Antrim into Lough Neagh. A weir exists at Ballyclare where water was diverted to the paper mill. The Six Mile Water Park was constructed around the river in Ballyclare, in order that the river's frequent floods would not affect houses in the area. It has a catchment of 117 square miles. Name While short, it is closer to long than six;Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference) accounts vary as to the origins of the name. The most widely accepted story is that Norman soldiers marching from Carrickfergus Castle calculated that they had marched six miles (10 km) when they forded the river at Ballyclare. When the Normans built the castle at Carrickfergus they placed a line of outposts along the river which was then called the Ollar (River of the Rushes). In time the soldiers making the journey from Carrickfergus to Antrim reached the river at this spot when they had travelled six miles (10 km) so began to call the Ollar the Six Mile Water. Angling The Six Mile Water is famous for its trout fishing. It has brown trout, salmon and dollaghan. Salmon had virtually disappeared from the river by the early part of the 20th century. Local anglers, concerned about the poor state of the river, formed the Antrim and District Angling Association in the late 1950s. They identified the main problems as pollution, habitat degradation through drainage works and obstructions, mainly weirs built in the 19th century for water power to supply the numerous mills in the area. Regulations to control methods of fishing and number of fish caught, together with protection of the river from poaching and pollution enabled native brown trout and dollaghan numbers to improve substantially by the 1970s. By 2004 over 200 salmon were caught by anglers in that year. The run of salmon in 2004 into the river probably exceeded its Conservation Limit for the first time in over 100 years. Culture The river is the subject of the song Six Mile Water, by the Metal band Therapy?. It appeared on their fifth full-length album Suicide Pact - You First released in 1999.

History The band began in September 1995, when guitarist Sathonys and drummer Matthias got together to assemble a dominant death metal band with harmonic arrangements (melodic death metal). They put adverts in several music magazines in the hopes that they would find suitable musicians to play with them. In answer to the advertisement, they were joined by bassist Marko Thomas and keyboardist and vocalist Vlad Dracul. The last member of their initial formation was the second guitarist, Hyperion, who joined them by the end of that year. With this formation the band recorded the Carpe Noctem demo tape, which received fair reviews from the German specialized press. It also attracted the attention of one of Century Media's executives, who began keeping track of the band. Agathodaimon then proceeded to play minor gigs and support some European bands. Eventually, they received an offer from Century Media to fund the recording of their second demo. This demo was recorded in early 1997 and was named Near Dark. It attracted the interest of quite a few recording labels, and in the end the band opted to sign with Nuclear Blast.Huey, Steve \\"[ Agathodaimon Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation After successfully composing the songs for their debut album Blacken the Angel, one of the members of Agathodaimon, Vlad, was forced to quit the band due to problems with immigration. After returning to his native Romania, he was denied re-entry in Germany. The situation involved the fact that he had left the country during Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's regime. The band therefore was forced to make use of guest musicians to record their debut. Akaias (from Asaru) did the vocals and Marcel \\"Vampallens\\" (from Nocte Obducta) took the role of the keyboards. Vlad's participation on the album was restricted to the solo song \\"Contemplation Song\\", which was sent to the band via air mail. The CD caused some impact, and Agathodaimon proceeded to tour with bands such as Children of Bodom and Hypocrisy. At the height of the album's success they opened gigs for Dimmu Borgir, Lacrimosa and other bands. In 1999, Vampallens decided to quit the band in order to dedicate himself fully to his main project Nocte Obducta. He was replaced by female keyboardist Christine S. To record their second album - Higher Art of Rebellion - the band travelled to Romania, in order to be able to play together with Vlad. The vocalist Akaias also participated in the recording of this album, as well as singer Dan Byron performing clean vocals. Recordings took place at Magic Sound in Bucharest. A European tour as headliner with Graveworm and Siebenb√ºrgen followed. After a short hiatus, the band recorded the album Chapter III in 2001 at the Kohlekeller Studio in Germany. Some changes to the band's structure followed, with Vlad definitely quitting the band, soon followed by Marko and Christine. Marko did leave because of health problems and quit making music, while Christine formed her own band Demonic Symphony, where she handles bass guitar and vocals. Marko and Christine were replaced by Darin Smith and Felix √ú. Walzer. In 2004 the band released the album Serpent's Embrace, which again was recorded at Kohlekeller Studio with Kristian Kohlmannslehner as producer. In early 2006 personal differences led to the split of Eddy and the rest of the band. A new bass player named Till (formerly active in Misanthropic, where Matthias also played drums for a while) joined the ranks, and the song writing for the next album took place. Singer, guitarist Frank \\"Akaias\\" Nordmann left in January 2007 to carry on with other musical interests. Matthias and Jonas left the band in 2008, with Manuel Steitz taking over on drums, and in October 2008, the band announced that they had recruited a new singer, Ashtrael.AGATHODAIMON - finally revealed their new vocalist!, Nuclear Blast In 2009 the band released their fifth studio album Phoenix.

Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the ITF has contested control of Kirkuk and other areas of northern Iraq, claiming that Kirkuk belongs to the Turkmen people. The ITF claims a region named Turkmeneli (literally meaning the \\"land of the Turkmens\\".) as the homeland of the Iraqi Turkmens. Turkmeneli includes within its boundaries Kirkuk, Tal Afar, Erbil, Mandali, Mosul and Tuz Khurmatu.. The Iraqi Army and Peshmerga have not allowed them to form their militia and take control of the areas where they live. The ITF played an active role in the fight against the Islamic State to defend the region of Turkmeneli (especially Kirkuk and surroundings) and the Iraqi Turkmen population living inside. Composition The ITF is a coalition of the following political parties: * Iraqi National Turkmen Party (INTP), founded in 1988 and which operated in the northern Iraqi no-fly zones * Turkmeneli Party, founded in 1992 in Northern Cyprus as the Turkmen Union Party * Provincial Turkmen Party * Movement of the Independent Turkmen * Iraqi Turkmen Rights Party * Turkmen Islamic Movement of Iraq Election results In the December 2005 Iraqi legislative election, the ITF list (#630) polled 76,434 votes, or 0.7% nationwide, according to the uncertified published results. The overwhelming majority of those votes were cast in Kirkuk Governorate, where the ITF won more than 10% of the total. Most of the rest of the ITF's votes were in Saladin Governorate. According to the full official results of that election, the ITF is entitled to only one seat in the permanent National Assembly. The party has been funded deeply by the Turkish administration and military. In the aftermath of the first Iraqi parliamentary election in 2005, the ITF lodged a number of formal complaints to the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq alleging vote fraud on the part of the Kurdish parties and protesting the Commission's decision to allow Kurdish internally displaced persons and refugees to vote in the places from which they had been expelled under Saddam Hussein. In the election, they received just over 90,000 votes, or 1.1% of votes cast, earning them three seats in the transitional National Assembly of Iraq. In the 2009 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election, most Turkmens boycott the elections. The ITF polled just 7,077 votes, or 0.38% of the popular vote, winning 1 seat. In the 2010 Iraqi national elections, the ITF has entered into an alliance with the Iraqi National Movement (Iraqiya) in the Governorate of Kirkuk. Iyad Allawi's Iraqiya List which the ITF candidates have taken part in, has won the elections in the governorate over the list of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in total votes. The ITF candidate in the Turkmen stronghold of Kirkuk, Arshad Salihi, won 59,732 votes all by himself. This was second only to Khalid Shwani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, who won 68,522 votes. The other candidates of ITF who have entered the parliament from ITF lists and different lists were as following, Arshad Salihi (Kirkuk), Jale √áift√ßi (Kirkuk), ƒ∞zzettin Devle (Mosul) who was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, Nebil Harbo (Mosul), M√ºdrike Ahmet (Mosul) and Hasan √ñzmen (Diyala) and 4 more including Turhan M√ºft√º who was appointed as the Minister of the Governorates. The ITF has won a total of 127,989 votes in general in Iraq, increasing their total vote cast by 34,600. ITF has decided to enter the latest Kurdish Elections which took place in late 2013, too. ITF has made up one list and got the highest vote in Erbil making Aydƒ±n Maruf the ITF Turkmen member of parliament from Erbil in KRG Parliament. In the Iraqi parliamentary election in 2014, the ITF has protected its total parliament member count of 10 and protecting the number of their directly elected number of candidates from ITF- Turkmen lists (without alliances) but also increasing the total number of ITF parliamenters to 3, as a result of the victory of the ITF member who participated in Muttahidun Lil'Islah List, Hena Asƒüar, in Tuz Khurmatu, a major Turkmen settlement located in the Tooz District of Governorate of Saladin. ITF tried hard to make all Turkmens cast their votes but they couldn't change the situation a lot, when compared to the previous elections and the ISIL advance in Iraq was shown as the main reason for this. The movement's leader Arahad Salihi (Kirkuk) and deputy Hasan Turan (Kirkuk) has been elected as members of parliament from ITF's own list; Kirkuk Turkmen Front List, headed by party's deputy Hasan Turan. ITF's, Kirkuk Turkmen Front List was the second in the Governorate of Kirkuk, winning 71,492 votes, nearly 13% of the total votes in Kirkuk Governorate. Although there was a second Turkmen list named Kirkuk Turkmen Alliance, participating in elections in Kirkuk; the votes of ITF in Kirkuk have increased about 3,000 when compared to the received votes of ITF candidates in the 2010 elections. The total vote received by Turkmen lists, nevertheless it was almost fully received by the ITF's Turkmen List, have increased too. There were 7 other non-ITF Turkmen candidates who were elected to the parliament from various lists. The biggest surprise was the 3 Turkmens getting elected in Saladin Governorate, including the first ITF parliament member of Tuz Khurmatu, from a non-ITF list, Hena Asƒüar. Training by the Turkish Special Forces Command In March 2015, exiled governor of Mosul, Atheel al-Nujaifi, revealed that Turkish Special Forces known as the \\"Maroon Berets\\" are training both Iraqi and Syrian Turkmens in a training mission targeted at recapturing ISIL's Mosul stronghold. Nujaifi also said that Turkish authorities had promised to send weapons. Turkish officials later confirmed training camps in Erbil, Mosul and Kirkuk as well as at unrevealed locations inside Syria. They said the training focussed on street clashes, sabotage and intelligence gathering. On the same day, Iraqi Turkmen Front MP Aydƒ±n Maruf declared that an official Turkmen Brigade of the Iraqi army would be created in the near future, starting with 500 men and then growing up to 1500 shortly thereafter for the defense of Tal Afar, Kifri and other major Turkmen settlements from ISIL and also for the planned offense to retake the areas which are currently under ISIL control, like Mosul. He also stated that the brigade from now on would receive official support by the Turkish Armed Forces and that an Iraqi Turkmen commander would be in charge of the brigade in the ongoing fight. This official agreement between ITF, the Iraqi Government and the KRG will be guaranteed officially by the Republic of Turkey. Maruf considered this an important step for the future of Iraqi Turkmens and Turkmeneli. There are 4,000 Turkmen fighters battling Daesh in the northern province of Kirkuk and 10,000 others have finished their training in Mosul.

Some of the entries contain encyclopedic information, and a Latin grammar is also included. The work was created by John Balbi (Johannes Januensis de Balbis or Johannes Balbus), of Genoa, a Dominican, who finished it on March 7, 1286. The work served in the late Middle Ages to interpret the Bible. The Catholicon was one of the first books to be printed, using the new printing technology of Johannes Gutenberg in 1460. It should be distinguished from Lagadeuc's Catholicon, a Latin-Breton- French dictionary compiled in 1464 by a priest of Tr√©guier called Jehan Lagadeuc which was published 5 November 1499 (the first printed French dictionary and the first ever trilingual dictionary). Editio princeps thumb The Catholicon was one of the first books to be printed, using the new printing technology of Johannes Gutenberg, with the date 1460; it is unclear who did the printing though Gutenberg himself was once regarded as the printer responsible. It was printed with a newly cut bastarda, a small but easily readable, still gothically influenced, printing type, using sixty-six lines of forty letters in each column. The Catholicon was printed in three impressions, which, on the basis of the papers used, can be assigned to the years around 1460, 1469 and 1472. The typesetting of these three impressions is almost identical. For the explanation of this phenomenon the historian of printing Lotte Hellinga puts forward the thesis that the Catholicon was printed in the same year (around 1469), but on three different presses by three different printers, who cooperated in a joint venture. Mosley suggests that the book may have been printed using metal types wired together in two-line units. Paul Needham has presented the revolutionary theory that the Catholicon was printed by means of two-line stereotypes or \\"slugs\\", a technology not documented in any form until after 1700. The correct attribution of the Catholicon to its printers is one of the knotty problems of incunabula research. The colophon of the book (in Latin) refers to the technology used: \\"With the help of the Most High ... this noble book Catholicon has been printed and accomplished without the help of reed, stylus or pen but by the wondrous agreement, proportion and harmony of punches and types, in the year of our Lord's incarnation 1460 in the noble city of Mainz of the renowned German nation ...\\". S. H. Steinberg in his book Five Hundred Years of Printing (1955) makes these observations \\"the type is about a third smaller than that of the 42-line Bible; it is considerably more economical and thus marks an important step towards varying as well as cheapening book-production by the careful choice of type\\"; \\"the book contains a colophon which it is difficult to believe to have been written by anybody but the inventor of printing himself\\".Quotations from Steinberg, S. H. (1961) Five Hundred Years of Printing; 2nd ed.

In the game world, she is a goddess in the drow pantheon, and her portfolios are song, dance, swordwork, hunting, moonlight and beauty. Eilistraee's name is pronounced as EEL-iss-TRAY-yee\\", \\"eel-ISS-tray-ee\\", \\"eel- iss-tray-yee\\" or \\"eil-iss-tray-yee\\". In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Eilistraee is the daughter of Corellon Larethian and of Araushnee (who later took the name Lolth after being punished by Corellon), a free-spirited and kind-hearted goddess, with a fiery streak in her personality. When, during her youth, a host of evil deities assaulted Arvandor (her home), Araushnee's treachery almost made her slay her own father. Even though she was cleared from any guilt, Eilistraee chose to share her mother's exile, because she knew that the drow would need her light and help in the dark times to come. Since after the descent of the drow, in the present era of the setting, Eilistraee tries her best to be a mother goddess to her people and bring them the hope of a new life: she fights to lead them back to the lands of light, helping them to flourish and prosper in harmony with all other races, free from Lolth's tyranny. Hers is an uphill battle, however, as her power is little and she is opposed by all the gods of the Dark Seldarine. But, despite having to overcome many hardships and setbacks, Eilistraee has never given up fighting for her people. In the 1370s DR, her conflict with her mother over the souls of the drow race ultimately led to Eilistraee's defeat and disappearance. It lasted for about a century, until The Sundering (c. 1480s DR), when Eilistraee returned to life and to her followers.Kim Mohan ed. (2015) Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide.

Some of their followers still war with each other, but the two deities do not. Thus far, Eilistraee‚Äôs teachings after the Sundering are the same as before the Sundering\\" Publication history=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition (1989‚Äì1999) Eilistraee was first detailed in Ed Greenwood's The Drow of the Underdark (1991).Greenwood, Ed. The Drow of the Underdark (TSR, 1991) Before being detailed in published material, Eilistraee already existed in Ed Greenwood's original Forgotten Realms. When asked to create more drow deities, the author used this opportunity to make the Dark Dancer official. Her role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in On Hallowed Ground (1996).McComb, Colin. On Hallowed Ground (TSR, 1996) Eilistraee received a very detailed description in Demihuman Deities (1998).Boyd, Eric L. Demihuman Deities (TSR, 1998) Eilistraee is described as one of the good deities that celestials can serve in the supplement Warriors of Heaven (1999).Perkins, Christopher. Warriors of Heaven (TSR, 1999) Dungeons & Dragons 3.0 edition (2000‚Äì2007) Eilistraee appears in 3rd edition in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting book (2001), and was further described in Faiths and Pantheons (2002).Boyd, Eric L., and Erik Mona. Faiths and Pantheons (Wizards of the Coast, 2002). Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (2014) Eilistraee is one of the Forgotten Realms deities that made a reappearance during the event known as The Sundering. She is mentioned as such in the novels SpellstormEd Greenwood (June 2015) Spellstorm (Wizards of the Coast) and Death Masks by Ed Greenwood. In the D&D; sourcebook Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Eilistraee receives a brief description, and is listed as one of the deities active in the post-Sundering era of the Forgotten Realms. The Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes includes a full entry for Eilistraee.Mike Mearls, Jeremy Crawford (May 2018) Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (Wizards of the Coast) Description In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Eilistraee is the patroness and protectress of those rare dark elves who yearn for a return to life on the surface Realms, at peace with other races, and to abandon the endless conflicts and intrigues that dominate the lives of most drow in the Lolth-dominated underground society. However she is also open to individuals of all races that wish for all people to live in harmony and peace (and some of them can be counted among her worshippers: humans, gnomes, elves, shapeshifters (children of the moon), half-orcs and half-elves). Artists, like bards, musicians and dancers, and hunters can also pray to the Dark Maiden. The Dark Maiden's home plane is the Demonweb Pits, along with the rest of the drow pantheon, which was originally located in the 66th layer of the Abyss; however, following the events of The War of the Spider Queen, the Demonweb Pits are no longer part of the Abyss, but a separate plane in its own right. She, however, has a home at Arvandor where she does not have to contend with her mother. Eilistraee's symbol is a bastard sword standing vertically, point up, outlined against a full moon and surrounded by a nimbus of filaments representing the goddess' ankle-long hair, all in silver. An alternative version is a nude drow female, depicted with long hair, wielding a bastard sword and dancing before a full moon (this version is a stylized representation of the Dark Dancer herself).Ed Greenwood, Sean K. Reynolds, Skip Williams, Rob Heinsoo (June 2001). Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition. (Wizards of the Coast), p. 237 Appearance Eilistraee appears as a drow female of extraordinary beauty. She is 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall, with long, strong, graceful limbs and a glossy, obsidian-dark skin. Her face is like that of her mother, Lolth, with delicately sculpted features and shape, save for her large eyes and ankle-length hair, which are of a glowing silvery hue. She usually appears unclad, cloaked only by her hair and silvery radiances that are ever-moving about her body. Her appearance inspires utter awe and astonishment (as expected from a goddess), as well as deeper emotions: those who contemplate her feel as if they have found the answer to all that their soul longs for, but upon her leaving, they experience a feeling of deep loss, or even desolation, though only for a brief time (as Sharlario Moonflower and his son felt when the Dark Dancer manifested to them, warning them of the dangers of Ilythiir).Elaine Cunningham (1998) Evermeet: Island of Elves (TSR, Inc. and Wizards of the Coast Personality Due to a history of grief and losses, and to the suffering of her people, melancholy and sadness are deeply rooted in Eilistraee's heart. It's a hard battle to endure; one that can weigh her down, but that has also taught her to search for and nurture beauty everywhere, even in places like the Underdark, where it doesn't seem to belong. Eilistraee fights her melancholy by striving to bring hope and joy where there is sorrow, so that no moment is lost to gloom, and to make life flourish wherever she goes. She's learned to find happiness in peace and arts, especially music and dance; in simple things like seeing artists composing and performing, craftsmen at their work, people doing acts of kindness, and lovers in tender moments. She especially takes delight in helping the needy in various practical ways, and in blessing artists with sudden bursts of creativity and inspiration. As a young goddess, Eilistraee was a free spirit, with a moody and wild side and an unpredictable temper. Even as she matured, these traits never really left her: she has a fiery streak and is prone to wild action, especially in protection of her faithful when they're harmed. The evil that is inflicted upon‚Äîand perpetuated by‚Äîmost drow causes a burning anger within her, one that can cause her to lash out. She's comforted that some worked their way free of the Spider Queen's web. The Dark Maiden is particularly close to her people. Aside from providing practical help in their everyday life, she's known to offer comfort and support in various ways (see Activities), and in the daily ritual known as the Evensong, she \\"listens\\" to the wordless messages of her followers as they let out the emotions, experiences, and reflections gathered during the day. When the right time comes, she also personally accompanies her followers who don't die in battle to their afterlife in a moving celebration known as the Last Dance. Eilistraee doesn't test her followers, as the challenges of life are enough of a test themselves. She values the intent behind their actions more than the actual success. Though focused on the drow, Eilistraee accepts folk of all races who dance along her path, who delight in life and in the free- form expression of life in all its forms. She fights so that all races could live peacefully together, helping and accepting each other despite their differences, and strongly believes in the possibility of redemption for those who have fallen to evil, especially the drow. Activities Ed Greenwood, the creator of Eilistraee and the Forgotten Realms, meant her to take the role of a nurturing and protecting mother-goddess for the whole drow race. In- world, when the Dark Elves were condemned and cursed by her father, despite her innocence, she chose to share the exile and curse of her people, her mother and her brother. She made such a choice so that she could be with the drow when they would have needed her the most, to provide a light in the darkness and a beacon of hope to her children in the difficult times that ‚Äì as she had foreseen ‚Äì would come upon them. So, in the present times of the Forgotten Realms, Eilistraee teaches and shows to the drow kindness and love, the joy and freedom of life that were taken away from them, calling them to her and singing to their hearts. The goddess helps the dark elves to strengthen, grow, and flourish in a hostile surface world, protecting her faithful and aiding them in hunting, swordcraft, and other practical matters of their everyday lives. Eilistraee prefers not to act openly and only rarely directly intervenes in her people's lives. But she is known to watch over them and help and assist any creature that she favors (even if not her worshiper) in immediately useful ways. For example, the sound of her hunting horn can be heard when her faithful are in danger (or when people needing help are nearby) heartening them and scaring away dangerous creatures. Her silvery radiance or silvery moths guide drow who are lost in the darkness to a safe place, or lighten childbirths that occur in the dark. Hers is the force that brings a stag within the reach of hungry drow. Eilistraee also manifests, usually through her light, in the moments when her \\"children\\" need her visible blessing and support or comfort. Overall, Eilistraee believes that individual drow have to find their own paths to redemption, and that her forcefully interfering would prevent this. Nevertheless, she is not unwilling to retaliate when her followers are threatened. Eilistraee sings her call to all dark elves‚Äîfrom the highest matron mother to the lowest male slave‚Äîsending them dreams or visions, showing them a different, better life (especially when they are close to the surface). Lolth is powerless to stop these visions, as too much interference from two goddesses could easily bring a mortal's mind to insanity. The drow definitely come to know about and \\"feel\\" the Dark Dancer at some point in their lives, but many of them either don't understand said dreams or emotions or choose to ignore, disbelieve, or reject them. Even then, while not many refuse Lolth to cleave to Eilistraee, many secretly yearn for the goddess and all that she wishes for them. In fact, it is not unusual for them to choose to spare a stricken worshiper of Eilistraee if they think that no priestess of Lolth is watching, or to fail to pass on to other drow something they might have seen of their activities, or to stop to watch a dance of Eilistraee worshipers rather than disrupting it. However, despite all her efforts, Eilistraee is opposed by the power of Lolth and the other evil drow gods, and what she can do is limited. Manifestations Eilistraee's most common sign is a silvery radiance (sometimes accompanied by a snatch of song or a few echoing notes of a harp). Eilistraee uses this light to assist her people: she is known to use it as a beacon guiding those lost in the woods, to shine a light on something dropped in the dark, and to illuminate or bless dark places where women give birth. She also uses it to bless a worshiper in various ways. Swords enveloped by the silvery light can not be broken or damaged and struck with maximum force. Blessed living creatures always react first in battle, can better evade or withstand blows, can strike more accurately, and can wound even creatures that needed only magic to be harmed. Sometimes, Eilistraee can use her radiance to bless the faithful or even non-faithful who decide to honor her with a solitary dance, turning the creature's hair into a mane of silvery, dancing flames. This can last as long as a month, or even be permanent. She also manifests when one of her priests leads a new convert to her faith in prayer, which is itself an offering to Eilistraee. She does this often, about 68% of the time. On rare occasions, she can decide to grant a male follower or a follower with no priestly powers who nevertheless follow her cause with the temporary ability to manifest her moonfire. It is Dark Maiden's most iconic spell, a beacon of light, whose intensity and color can be controlled by the creator at will (ranging from a faint glow to a clear, bright ‚Äì but not blinding ‚Äì light). Moonfire has the same intensity as moonlight, and it is generally used as a light source for reading, to see in the dark, as a signal for communication or for artistic purposes. Manifested moonfire can move as the creator wished and around the creator's body as fast as desired, however it moves up to 6.6 feet per second when far from the caster's body. The blessed recipient can guide it in any direction, through any opening, and cause the glow to appear in any size. Eilistraee gifts her moonfire to show her blessing or support, or simply to provide some light. However, the lucky bearer has no control over the moonfires duration, intensity, or location ‚Äì such things are solely up to the goddess. Eilistraee is known to sometimes conjure the sound of a high and distant hunting horn, to rally or hearten her followers or to scare off aggressors, making them believe that reinforcements are coming for those harassed. When there are no enemies about, worshipers interpret the sound of the horn to mean there is someone close by they need to aid. Sometimes Eilistraee appears in person, to show her favor, give a blessing, or hearten her followers. Worshipers lucky enough to see her usually only glimpse her from afar, balanced atop a distant hillock or battlement, with her silver hair flowing behind her. At times, she can also appear during celebrations dedicated to her, dancing and leaping from the flames of bonfires, or manifest herself by night, cloaked and cowled and with her radiance dimmed, to travelers in the woodlands, usually to test their kindness. However and whenever she appears, her song is heard: a tune of eerie beauty, moving many to tears. Eilistraee demonstrates her favor and happiness through the discovery of particular minerals or gems (like mithral, moonbars, moonstones, and silver) or with a sudden inspiration to write a beautiful song or poem, or to craft a magnificent sword for those who had the ability. However, the Dark Dancer can also let her displeasure be known, and does so by making a cold breeze rise, by making the disfavored ones feel a chill in their hands or feet, through a sudden lack of inspiration or talent in any form of art, or through the failure to catch anything while hunting. Abilities Eilistraee has the ability to dance and sing to elicit emotions in her allies and foes, or to inspire courage and enhance her allies' skills: such is the beauty and power of her art that even creatures normally immune to such effects can't resist. Among her great godly skills, Eilistraee is an excellent weaponsmith, and can freely create almost any magical item pertaining to beauty, hunting, moonlight, song, or swordplay; she is an expert in matters of magic, nature, and faith. As the goddess of dance, song, and hunt she is an awe-inspiring dancer, singer and acrobat; and she is a supreme hunter. Eilistraee specializes in swords of all forms, but is an absolute mistress of the bastard sword. She fights combining the grace and agility of her dance with the lethality of her fencing skills. The Dark Dancer can instantly become aware of threats posed to good-aligned drow, to her followers, or to drow thinking of rejecting the faith of the deities of the drow pantheon, but only if their number is equal to or greater than five hundred. Teachings In the Forgotten Realms, Eilistraee, like all deities, has a definite set of teachings for her followers. ; On helping others Aid and protect all folks in need, of any race, weak and strong, kind or rude, promoting harmony and acceptance among all races. Lend your help to all those who fight for good whenever there are ways to do so. When not fighting evil, be always kind‚Äîeven to those who show rudeness‚Äîand aid others in acts of kindness. Strangers are your friends. Hungry travelers are to be fed and the homeless are to be given shelter‚Äîunder your own roof if needed--. When traveling and while adventuring, feed, help and protect all those in need met along the way as a prayer and offering to the goddess. Patrol the lands about, especially in cold winters, so that all those who are lost, hurt, or bitten by the cold can be given appropriate cures and shelter. ; On promoting joy, arts, and beauty Bring happiness and merriment everywhere you go, lifting people's hearts with kindness, gaiety, songs, jests, and revelry. Nurture and create beauty, promote and practice music and dance, learn new songs and dances and how to play, craft and repair musical instruments. Pass this learning on whenever possible and use it to bring joy to friends and strangers alike. Feasts should always be joyful events and food eaten with the accompaniment of music, save for sad occasions. Practice swordwork, learning new techniques with the blade. ; On Drow Encourage drow to return to the surface world whenever and wherever there are ways to do so. Work to promote peace with other races, helping the drow to forge their own place in the world and become part of its rightful, nonevil inhabitants. Aid all dark elves who are in danger or in need of help. If they are in combat, the fighting must be ended as soon as possible, with as little bloodshed as possible. All drow met, when not working evil on others, are to be given the message of Eilistraee: ; On food Learn how to best cook food and game, and gather new recipes and spices whenever there is the chance to do so. Try to feed yourself by your own gardening and hunting skills and assist hunters when possible. If food is aplenty, part of it is to be set aside and given to all those in need (especially outcasts and individuals of other races)--try to always carry some food for this purpose--. Give any remaining food to the priestesses of the Dark Maiden, as they will do the same and none shall go hungry. ; On conflict Repay violence with swift violence, quickly removing dangers and threats, so that the fewest may be hurt. When fighting evil, the bodies of the fallen enemies are to be burned as an offering to the goddess, unless they happen to be edible and nonsentient and hungry people are near. When faithful, friends and allies fall in battle, priestesses of the Dark Maiden must comfort and soothe those who are mourning the loss, and provide a funeral song and burial. ; On possessions Wealth should be used to buy food, swords, armor and musical instruments and to assist the work of the goddess. When helping others, take as price no more than a single tool or favor that can be used to serve the goddess' will. Eilistraee and her church detest slavery and actively fight it whenever possible.Ed Greenwood (1995). The Seven Sisters. (TSR, Inc), p. 61. . Followers of the Dark Maiden are therefore forbidden from taking slaves, and prisoners of war (mostly Lolth-worshipping drow or untrusted individuals who have acquired too much knowledge and that are held for some time to make sure that such knowledge isn't used against the followers of Eilistraee) are usually made work for food and shelter, but they aren't owned and can't be commanded by anyone (only supervisors assigned by the decision-makers among the Dark Dancer's worshippers can give them orders, in selected cases). Relationships Eilistraee's allies are the elven gods of the Seldarine, as well as Mystra, Sel√ªne, Lurue, Haela Brightaxe, Callarduran Smoothhands, and the other good deities of the Underdark races. While the Dark Maiden and the Seldarine are allies, their relationship is a difficult one, because of the division between drow and elves and because of the perception that many elves have of their \\"dark kin\\". This is especially true for Shevarash, with whom Eilistraee barely manages to keep an uneasy truce. Among the elven powers, Eilistraee is only close to Erevan Ilesere. Eilistraee is surprisingly close to the human goddess of magic Mystra, through Qilue Veladorn, seventh of the Seven Sisters, who serves both goddesses as Chosen of Mystra and as Chosen of Eilistraee. Her enemies are the drow gods of the Dark Seldarine‚Äînamely Kiaransalee, Ghaunadaur, her nephew Selvetarm and especially her own mother Lolth. She also counts as foes the other evil deities of the Underark: Deep Duerra and Laduguer, Blibdoolpoolp, the Blood Queen, Diinkarazan and Diirinka, the Great Mother, Gzemnid, Ilsensine, Ilxendren, Laogzed, and Maanzecorian before his death. She also counts as an enemy Malar, a rival and evil god of the hunt in the surface world. However, Selvetarm wasn't always among the Dark Dancer's enemies‚Äîonce, he admired his aunt and she inspired to turn toward goodness, before Lolth tricked him into a terrible fall. The Dark Maiden is infuriated by the evil and corruption of both Lolth and Ghaunadaur. Before 1489 DR, Eilistraee counted Vhaeraun, her own brother, among her enemies, and she was saddened by his cruelty and selfishness. However, post 1489 DR, after the time spent as the Masked Lady, and after their return during the Sundering, Eilistraee and Vhaeraun deeply know and understand each other. As a consequence, they are closer, and have become more open to each other's ways and goals. They have reached a truce, even if some of their followers still remain foes. History In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Eilistraee was born the daughter of Corellon Larethian, head of the elven gods, and Araushnee the Weaver (who later took the name of Lolth), a minor elven goddess. She was the sister of Vhaeraun. In the game world, her history is a troubled and difficult one, described below. Exile The commonly accepted version of the story or myth of how Eilistraee came to her role in the drow pantheon runs as follows. Around ‚àí30000 DR, ambitious and traitorous, envious of the authority that her consort Corellon had on the elven people, Araushnee (with the cooperation of her son, Vhaeraun) gathered a host of deities opposed to the Seldarine, tricking them into assaulting Arvandor in an attempt to overthrow Corellon. The Weaver tried to seduce Fenmarel Mestarine, elven god of outcasts and rebels, to join her in the imminent rebellion. While he was initially tempted by Araushnee's advances, he ultimately declined the offer and, knowing Corellon's deep love for his consort, trusted Sehanine Moonbow to find a solution. Once aware of Araushnee's plans, Sehanine tried to dissuade her from such madness, but the Weaver reacted violently, defeating and imprisoning the moon goddess with the aid of Vhaeraun. When the attack began, Eilistraee (whose skills in archery, scouting, and hunting were widely known among the Seldarine) was the first to spot the threat, allowing her father and the other elven deities to prepare a defense. The Dark Maiden took part in the battle, enthusiastic and proud to be able to fight by her father's side in defense of their home. In the heat of the battle that ensued, when Ghaunadaur made its entrance, Corellon painfully realized that the threat had to have come from within the Seldarine itself, as a being like Ghaunadaur could only enter Arvandor if a true evil already lurked within the plane. His sorrow grew even more intense when he realized that his lover, Araushnee, was behind it, as she stood observing the battle in triumph. Seeing the distraction and shock of the elven lord, an ogre god took advantage of the situation and charged towards his position: he almost managed to end his life, but Eilistraee acted swiftly to defend her father, loosing an arrow at the charging ogre-god. The young goddess didn't know, however, that the scabbard that Araushnee had crafted for Corellon's sword was imbued with a curse which magically drew the shaft of the arrow, changing its path to instead pierce his chest. Seeing the scene from the skies, Aerdrie Faenya, unaware of the deception, struck the still-shocked Eilistraee down, incapacitating her. Despite Corellon being almost fatally wounded, the battle was ultimately won by the forces of the Seldarine and, as soon as the last invader was driven from Arvandor, the elven deities ‚Äì still unbelieving that the Dark Maiden could act against her father ‚Äì gathered around the unconscious elven lord, trying to aid him and save his life. It was then that Araushnee, faking grief, put in motion the second part of her plan (as she had intended for the invaders to be defeated). Pretending to do her best to save her lover, she tried to use a concoction of poisonous herbs, prepared by Eilistraee for the arrows of the mortal dark elves, to finish Corellon, passing it for a healing elixir made up of water from Elysium and healing herbs. She hoped that if her treachery was uncovered, she could still blame Eilistraee, as the potion had been her work. This plan didn't go well: Sehanine Moonbow, whom Araushnee and Vhaeraun had ambushed and trapped before the invasion (because she had seen their true intentions and tried to warn them against their plans), had in fact managed to free herself and intervened in time to save Corellon (together with Aerdrie Faenya and Hanali Celanil, in the form of the triune goddess Angharradh) and free Eilistraee from guilt. After the elven lord regained consciousness and the truth was made clear, he had to take the painful decision to banish all the dark elven deities for their roles in the war against the Seldarine. Eilistraee was cleared from any wrongdoing, considered only an unwitting participant, but regardless she insisted upon this punishment from her reluctant father. She foresaw that the dark elves would need a beacon of good within their reach and her help and support in the times to come. Wandering After her exile, the Dark Maiden wandered Toril, the same world that the elves had chosen as their home. For centuries, she fought Vhaeraun's corruption of the Ilythiiri, thwarting his efforts to gain influence over all the dark elves of the south. But this only allowed Lolth and Ghaunadaur to fill the void and command great authority over them, posing an even greater threat. The following centuries inflicted blow after blow to Eilistraee and her followers. During the Crown Wars (‚àí12000 DR to ‚àí9000 DR), she could only mitigate the growing control Lolth, Vhaeraun, and Ghaunadaur had over the dark elves. In ‚àí10500 DR, the Dark Disaster ‚Äì a magical cataclysm unleashed by the elves of Aryvandaar ‚Äì caused the death of many of her people in Miyeritar, severely weakening the goddess' power. Meanwhile, Lolth and Ghaunadaur gained great influence among the dark elves, culminating in ‚àí10000 DR, when the Seldarine and the elven court cursed and exiled all dark elves (including Eilistraee's followers, turning them into drow), because of the corruption that Lolth and the balor Wendonai were spreading among the noble houses and the influent people of Ilythiir. They feared that such corruption could spread among the population (the faith of Lolth was becoming common, among the other ones). Eilistraee tried to be a guide for the exiled drow, but in her state she could not rival Lolth as deity of the dark elves, and the Spider Queen led them in the Underdark. After this event, Lolth's and Ghaunadaur's persecution of worshipers of rival deities further marginalized the influence of the Lady of the Dance for millennia. Eilistraee found an unlikely prot√©g√© in her nephew- god, Selvetarm. He was the son of Vhaeraun and Zandilar the Dancer (who would later become one with Bast, forming Sharess), but had spurned both his parents and walked alone for centuries, neither good nor evil. Finally, he was befriended by his aunt Eilistraee, and grew close to her. Selvetarm came to admire her goodness and appreciate her teachings, and the goddess hoped that, by teaching him her ways and redeeming him, he could become an exemplar that would aid her in healing the rift between the dark elves and the Seldarine. However, said hope and friendship ended in the late 3rd century after Dalereckoning, when Lolth tricked Selvetarm into slaying Zanassu (a demon lord whom Lolth considered her rival, as he claimed to have power over spiders), by promising him that doing so would gain him the appreciation of the Dark Maiden. But Selvetarm was overwhelmed by the demonic essence and he fell wholly to evil, ending up as Lolth's champion. Spiteful Lolth did this to prevent her daughter gaining an ally among the Dark Seldarine. Despite all these setbacks, Eilistraee kept fighting to bring her hope to the drow and lead them back to their rightful place in the light. It was only after Dalereckoning that her faith regained a degree of prominence in Faer√ªn. War of the Spider Queen and Lady Penitent In the 1372 DR, the goddess Lolth went into a state of hibernation, a period called the Silence of Lolth, with Selvetarm protecting her, as part of a plan to increase her power and separate her divine realm, the Demonweb Pits, from the Abyss. For about one year, she stopped granting spells to her followers and became effectively inactive. During this time, Lolth's absence led a considerable number of her followers to seek alternatives in the other deities of the Dark Seldarine and this resulted in Eilistraee gaining followers and influence. She chose one of her new converts, Halisstra Melarn, to wield the artifact known as the Crescent Blade, which could be used to kill Lolth before her awakening (in 1373 DR). Halisstra went on a mission to the Demonweb Pits, leading two fellow priestesses of the Dark Maiden, Uluyara and Feliane. However, after being defeated at the hand of Quenthel Baenre, Halisstra ultimately decided to betray Eilistraee and convert back to the awakened Lolth. The Spider Queen punished her former heresy by turning her into the Lady Penitent, whose duty was to hunt drow who tried to turn to other faiths. The Crescent Blade was left broken, lying in the Demonweb Pits.Lisa Smedman (February 2005). Extinction. (Wizards of the Coast). .Philip Athans (August 2005). Annihilation. (Wizards of the Coast). .Paul S. Kemp (February 2006). Resurrection. (Wizards of the Coast). . Even after Lolth emerged from her Silence, the deities of the Dark Seldarine continued battling for supremacy over the drow or, in Eilistraee's case, to free them from Lolth's renewed grasp. After the end of the Silence of Lolth, working on the Spider Queen's side, Selvetarm ordered his Judicators to initiate a series of attacks against the shrines and temples of Eilistraee. At the same time, the church of Vhaeraun planned to cast a High Magic spell to allow Vhaeraun to enter his sister's realm and assassinate her. The followers of the Masked Lord lacked the trust to cast that kind of magic, so they worked to kill various priestesses of Eilistraee and trap their soul, in order to use them for the ritual. Eventually, Qilu√© Veladorn managed to learn about their plan and worked to disrupt it, alongside the drow mage Q'arlynd Melarn. Q'arlynd had come in contact with the followers of Eilistraee through a portal to the surface that a priestess had opened in the ruins of Ched Nasad, and Qilu√© managed to gain his loyalty: the drow mage saw in her, chosen of both Eilistraee and Mystra, a worthy leader. Qilu√© asked the mage to take the place of one of the Vhaerunites and try to disrupt the ritual. Q'arlynd accepted the task to prove his loyalty to the Dark Maiden. Meanwhile, Cavatina Xarann, a Darksong Knight serving Eilistraee, was sent by Qilu√© on a mission to recover the Crescent Blade from the Demonweb pits. While Cavatina was in the Demonweb Pits and Q'arlynd was attempting to stop the Vhaerunites, Qilu√© led the defense against the followers of Selvetarm who tried to attack the Promenade of the Dark Maiden. On Nightal 20 of the 1375 DR, Cavatina killed the demigod Selvetarm (with the help of the Lady Penitent), using the Crescent Blade that she had recovered almost intact. On the same date, Q'arlynd failed to accomplish his mission and Vhaeraun managed to enter his sister Eilistraee's realm and attempt to assassinate her. No mortal actually witnessed the battle that ensued, so what happened remained largely unknown. However, Eilistraee emerged from the battle alive, suggesting that Vhaeraun had failed and perished at the hand of his sister. Chaos and despair spread among the followers of the Masked Lord, but some thought that their god was still alive, and that the twins had a plan and agreed to merge and work together against their mother for a time. Others were convinced that Vhaeraun succeeded and masked as Eilistraee. Either way, it was certain that after the event, Eilistraee was changed: she held both her brother's and her own portfolios, she gained the title of \\"Masked Lady\\", and caused her followers and Vhaeraun's to cooperate, albeit uneasily.Lisa Smedman (January 2007). Sacrifice of the Widow. (Wizards of the Coast). .In one of his answers, Ed Greenwood suggests that Eilistraee actually spared her brother's life. The Dark Maiden defeated Vhaeraun with the indirect help of her ally Mystra, as the Weave frustrated the Masked Lord's magic while enhancing Eilistraee's. The goddess temporarily took her brother's portfolio, and trapped his sentience in the Weave, where was enfolded in a dream by Mystra. The Lady of Mysteries did that to ensure that the two drow siblings would survive the cataclysm that she knew was coming: the Spellplague, in which she would be \\"killed\\" to renew the Weave, and magic would go wild. On the same date, Cavatina Xarann, a priestess and Darksong Knight of Eilistraee, killed the demigod Selvetarm (with the help of the Lady Penitent) using the Crescent Blade. In 1377 DR, Kiaransalee and her cultists initiated hostilities against the Masked Lady and her followers. Qilu√© Veladorn and the church of Eilistraee retaliated with an assault against the Acropolis of Thanatos, in the drow city of V'elddrinnsshar, the main temple of the Vengeful Banshee. The war ended with the defeat of the cultists of Kiaransalee and with Eilistraee's answer to the demigoddess' attack: a spell performed by the drow mage Q'arlynd Mealrn, which deleted her name from the minds of every Torillian being, including Kiaransalee herself, leading to her disappearance.Lisa Smedman (September 2007). Storm of the Dead. (Wizards of the Coast). . Between the 1377 DR and 1379 DR, cultists of Ghaunadaur attacked the Promenade in the attempt to destroy the prison, guarded by the followers of Eilistraee, that prevented their god from creeping to Toril. Their attempt failed, but the inhabitants of the temple suffered heavy losses. In Flamerule of 1379 DR, the Masked Lady, while inhabiting the body of Qilu√© Veladorn, was killed by Halisstra Melarn using the Crescent Blade. Qilu√© planned to kill the balor Wendonai (whom Lolth used to corrupt the drow into following her), whose essence was held inside the Crescent Blade, by taking it into her and destroying it with Mystra's silver fire. If successful, she would have freed the drow from the demon's influence, but he managed to trick Halisstra into killing Qilu√© before that could happen, making her believe that the chosen and her goddess were actually Lolth.Lisa Smedman (June 2008). Ascendancy of the Last. (Wizards of the Coast)In the same answer mentioned in the previous note, Ed Greenwood hints that Eilistraee actually managed to survive Halisstra's attempt to kill her, albeit much weakened. When Qilu√© Veladorn was killed, since the Masked Lady was inhabiting her body, a great part of her power was dragged into the Weave with the Chosen's soul (the souls of Mystra's chosen often become Voices in the Weave after their death, as explained in the novel Spellstorm, and their memories and experiences are shared by Mystra). After that, for about a century, Eilistraee could only manfest herself as a floating black mask surrounded by moonlight, capable of silently communicating with mortals, but not of answering prayers or granting spells (except by direct touch). After Mystra and the Weave were completely restored in 1487 DR, the goddess of magic could finally give Eilistraee her own lost power, and do the same Vhaeraun, after having awakened him from his dream.Other in-world rules could point to Eilistraee's survival. When the Lady Penitent used the Crescent Blade against Qilu√© Veladorn, the latter was being inhabited by the Dark Maiden, holding a part of her power (since deities could not fully manifest themselves on the material plane, as explained in On Hallowed Ground). That would mean that the blade didn't hit the goddess herself, but the part of her essence infused in her chosen's body. In addition to that, deities could only be truly killed while in their planar realm or by being starved of followers (again explained in On Hallowed Ground), so Eilistraee's survival could not be excluded. Furthermore, the Crescent Blade could not destroy souls anymore after being reforged, as was shown by Cavatina Xarann's soul surviving her body being killed by the sword in Ascendancy of the Last Meanwhile, another High Magic ritual performed by the drow mage Q'arlynd Melarn transformed those drow not tainted by Wendonai and the followers of Eilistraee back into their original dark elven form, and Corellon Larethian thus permitted the souls of Eilistraee's faithful and the newly transformed dark elves to enter Arvandor. The Sundering and Rebirth During the 1480s DR, with the event known as the Sundering, the Overgod Ao separated the twin worlds Abeir and Toril once again and rewrote the Tablets of Fate (an artifact which contains the name of every deity of the pantheon and their portfolio). During that time, many deities of Toril who were considered dead or lost managed to return to life,Kim Mohan ed. (2015) Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. (Wizards of the Coast) the Dark Maiden being among them. Post-Sundering, after Flamerule of 1489 DR, Eilistraee is alive again and she is one of the deities with whom the returned Mystra is currently sharing the Weave (as revealed in Ed Greenwood's novel Spellstorm). Eilistraee has taken her title of Dark Maiden once again, as she and her brother Vhaeraun are separate entities, but the two siblings have reached a reciprocal understanding and the enmity between them is no more. The Dark Maiden has personally manifested and danced with her followers (especially in the Sword Coast region), who have returned under her protection and enthusiastically spread the voice of her return. For example, Eilistraee has appeared personally, dancing in the moonlight, near the walls of Waterdeep, witnessed by the inhabitants of the city. This has led many of her followers to the City of Splendors, with the intent of building a temple to the goddess within its walls. Some have asked for the sponsorship of the harpers, intending to buy a few buildings, in order to destroy them and then conjure a small wood and rivers, to use as a dancing place to express their faith.  Followers and clergy  In the Forgotten Realms, the worshipers of Eilistraee mostly consist of those drow who hope to escape the danger and darkness of the Underdark and Lolth's evil, taking back their place in the surface world. However, in line with her ideals, Eilistraee welcomes beings of all races: elves, humans, and especially half-elves are among the followers of the goddess. They share the desire of seeing all races living in harmony, without pointless discrimination or wars, and work towards that goal (and those among them who are drow also fight to build their own place on the Realms above). The faithful of Eilistraee, however, are little known and poorly understood by inhabitants of both the Realms Above and the Underdark. Her worshippers are figures of myth and superstition and targets of prejudice and wild mistruths. Some surface dwellers believe that they are the disguised vanguard of the Spider Goddess's plan to take over the surface, while those drow who follow Lolth or other evil deities suspect them of being surface elf spies and saboteurs posing as drow as a prelude to invasion. Most non-elves can not comprehend the existence a good drow deity, while surface elves are uncomfortable considering it, finding Eilistraee a threat to their doctrine that the dark elves were wholly to blame for the Crown Wars and other ancient tragedies. The Harpers appreciate the hope that the goddess and her faith represent and assist them on the surface of Faerun. Composition of the Clergy The clergy of Eilistraee are collectively known as \\"the Dark Ladies\\", although individual temples often have their own naming conventions for both the clergy collectively and individual titles. Young initiates and acolytes are known as Maids. Individual titles vary greatly from temple to temple, but some suitable examples include Moon Dancer, Moon Singer, Dark Huntress, Argent Maid, Living Sword, Unsheathed Blade, Sword Smith, Bright Edge of Darkness, Darksong Knight, Protector and Ghost of the Moonstruck Night. Clerics of Eilistraee are individuals of any race, but almost always female, because ‚Äì due to the goddess' nature of nurturing mother ‚Äì One cannot truly feel the Divine Dance of Eilistraee PROPERLY except as a female. However, during the 1300s, the faith of Eilistraee started to open up to male priests: this was Eilistraee's choice and by 1373 DR all her clerics were aware of it (as the goddess is close to her clergy). At the time, some female worshippers initially disliked this change, and priests could be met with distrust by some priestesses, who feared that they could merely be hungry for power: they would be wary of males, act with coldness and watch over their actions (at least until acceptance on a personal level was achieved, by working alongside them). Nonetheless, no priestess would reject males who wished to join the clergy, or act against them, refuse to aid and accept them, or renounce to Eilistraee's vision. On the contrary, taken as a whole, all clergy of the Dark Maiden welcomed the fellowship of more and more followers of the goddess, no matter what gender. However, in order to truly feel the Divine Dance of Eilistraee (and therefore become priests), males had to Dance the Changedance at least once, spending time as females (including everyday life, and not only rituals). Generally this wasn't perceived negatively, and with time the priests found themselves feeling the need to spend more and more time as female, because through that they could feel and cleave more fully to the nature of the Dark Maiden (and the willingness to remain shapechanged for long periods of time was seen and appreciated as a mark of dedication by the female clergy). However these priests were few and usually secretive. Near the 1489 DR, with the return of Eilistraee, the situation was further changed. The cooperation with the church of Vhaeraun that happened between 1375 DR and 1379 DR, the new friendship between Eilistraee and her brother and their experience as the Masked Lady, has led to a further opening towards male priests. They can in fact directly cleave to Eilistraee, without the need of \\"dancing the Changedance\\". Organization ;Communities Most Eilistraeen/Eilistraee-dominated (as generally Torilian people tend to worship more than one deity) communities form around a temple or shrine of the goddess and for this reason they are usually led by priestesses, but any member can express concerns and ideas about any matters, and priestesses listen to them before making their decision. Outside of the Clergy, male and female worshippers usually have the same duties and roles: guardians, warriors, experts, artisans/artists, gathering food and other general works. Males are primarily involved in the decision-making through their expertise in given fields, but they rarely are priests (and therefore leaders). Differently from Lolthite societies, males are however generally treated with fairness and equality (even if at times, some priestesses or even whole communities could have a different stance, likely because centuries of dogma and tradition due to Lolth's doctrine were hard to overcome) ;Clergy The clergy of Eilistraee is different from most other religious organizations in that there wasn't any hierarchy or chain of command, as everyone stood on the same ground (even if most followers recognized Qilu√© Veladorn of The Seven Sisters as their guide and voice of the goddess). Activities of the clergy The Church of Eilistraee works by putting their goddess' teachings in practice. Their main duty is to encourage the drow to return to the surface world, reaching to them whether they are fugitives, raiders or inhabitants of the Underdark. They show to the drow that a different kind of life, far from Lolth, is possible, and assist them in making this choice by giving them aid, food, acceptance and safe places to live. Eilistraeeans perform missions underground, looking for those dark elves who are in need of their help and that can be brought on the surface (mostly slaves, commoners, fallen and hunted nobles or drow who are generally unsatisfied with the life that Lolth imposes them), bringing them the Message of Eilistraee. Many of them carry tiny swords to give out to drow in the Underdark, that serve as keys for safe passage to temples, or as identification tokens. Some priestesses of the Dark Maiden live in Lolth- dominated drow settlements, hiding from the clergy of the Spider Queen, even posing as her followers, in order to carry out the above-mentioned missions. These clerics and the Eilistraeen converts who have to hide their faith in order to let it spread and to survive under the thumb of Lolth are known as Secret Moondancers.Thomas M. Reid, Sean K. Reynolds (Nov. 2005). Champions of Valor. (Wizards of the Coast). As the Dark Maiden's teachings require, the clerics of Eilistraee actively work to promote harmony between drow and other races, so that their people can be accepted and live in peace in their rightful place on the surface. This also involves the activities described in the section about Eilistraee's Teachings, like lending their own sword, helping hands, cures and food to assist people of any race in need, both to gain their acceptance (dispelling fears and prejudices about Eilistraee's goal) and because the priestesses of the Dark Maiden believe that it is the right thing to do. The Church of the Dark Dancer also acts through envoys, diplomats and emissaries living near (or sometimes within) other races' settlements. An example is Karsel'lyn Lylyl-Lytherraias, former agent of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower and ambassador of the Eilistraeen Dark Elves on the elven island of Evermeet, who is trying to gain her people a place in the land that is supposed to be a safe haven for all elven people.Anne Gray McCready et al. (March 1994). Elves of Evermeet. (TSR, Inc) Seyll Auzkovyn and the followers of Eilistraee active near the elven and human community of Elventree also work for a peaceful coexistence between their people and the other inhabitants of the area.Richard Baker (May 2003). Condemnation. (Wizards of the Coast). . The Promenade of the Dark Maiden is another example of this, founded because of Eilistraee's direct request to Qilu√© Veladorn. The function of the temple is to prevent the avatar of the slime god Ghaunadaur from freeing itself and attacking the city of Waterdeep, which stands on the surface upon the shrine, to counter slavery and slaver merchants and organizations of the near Skullport (while also offering shelter to former slaves), and to and help drow exiles (or fleeing from danger) to eventually find their place in the lands of light. The faithful also have routine activities of food growing and gathering/hunting, preparation of cures and all that is needed to aid the drow to return to the surface. They also gather resources, weapons and armors (preferably magical) to use for their cause. Patrols in the areas near Eilistraeen communities are common (especially during cold winters) and have the purpose of finding any traveler (including fugitive drow or even wounded drow raiders) hurt, lost or hungry, and to spot (and possibly neutralize) potential threats for the community and other settlements in the area. Aside from their work towards the main goal of their goddess, the priestesses of the Dark Maiden are known to nurture beauty, music and song; to assist hunters; to help people of any race through acts of kindness, and to spread joy and merriment (often through song and dance) whenever they see ways to do so (and it is appropriate). They have also to be skilled in the art of playing of at least one of the Dark Maiden's favored instruments (horn, flute, or harp); to be adequate singers as well as fit, graceful dancers, and to pass along and teach their skill. They gather songs and musical knowledge constantly and acquire training in the use of the sword when they can. Clerics are allowed to go adventuring, as long as they keep following Eilistraee's teachings, aiding, feeding and defending the needy on the way. Among their duties is also to convert at least one stranger per moon to the worship of Eilistraee. Orders ; Sword Dancers of Eilistraee Specialized clerics are known as Sword Dancers of Eilistraee. They are excellent dancers and have the ability to use the sword in a unique fashion: through an agile, acrobatic and almost artistic swordplay, they can fight in such a graceful way to resemble a dance. To become a Sword Dancer, a drow has to spend at least 1 month on the surface, dancing each moonlit night for Eilistraee, and has to witness dawn at least once. The sword dancers lead the missions to find, help and protect any drow looking to return to the surface (or that can be made to return) and join a different life. They are skilled diplomats, especially active near elven and other races' settlements, working to establish peace and cooperation between the drow and the surface dwellers. These priestesses also have various unique magical powers, granted to them by their goddess. They can form a particular bond with their sword, which allows them to infuse the weapon with Eilistraee's magic. They can imbue it with a variety of magical enhancements, let it sing like a singing sword (making them strike with increased precision and rallying their hearts), or let it dance (like a dancing weapon) to attack the enemy on its own or to protect the priestess. The Sword Dancers have the ability to cast the magic missile spell, or to use its energy to empower their next sword strike, surrounding their blade with blue-white flames. They can also use their magic to temporarily enchant a bladed weapon with a silvery glow that increases the precision of its strikes, without the possibility of it being dispelled. The Sword Dancers can sing and dance to channel the power of Eilistraee, and have the ability to sing their magic even amidst the chaos of the battle, while dodging and dancing around or while wounded. This magic is known as Spellsong. They can also manifest Eilistraee's moonfire at will. ; Darksong Knights The Darksong Knights are an elite order of Eilistraeen crusaders, mostly active in the Southern Faer√ªn, beneath the lands of ancient Ilythiir. Composed entirely of crusaders and warrior/priests, each members of this order chose to devote her life not only to the furthering of the Dark Maiden's ethos, but also to the destruction of the Abyss-spawned yochlol, also known as the handmaidens of Lolth. ; Silverhair Knights The Silverhair Knights are an order of Eilistraeens fully dedicated to the conversion and subsequent protection of drow who have come to the surface of Faer√ªn. They are most active in regions where drow attempted to establish a foothold on the surface, mostly in Cormanthor. They are different from the Sword Dancers in that they follow very closely Eilistraee's teachings: they vow to never willingly kill any drow. They aim to show to other dark elves the strength that can be found in compassion, and that living in peace, without the endless conflict and paranoia that rule their society, is a concrete possibility. They are convinced that this can lead the drow to choose to abandon the teachings of Lolth and cleave to Eilistraee. The Silverhair knights have a wide array of tools dedicated to such purpose. They are specialized in wielding their swords to incapacitate opponents rather than outright killing them, and have spells capable of incapacitating targets by various means (for example, by letting them feel the weight of the suffering they have inflicted upon other creatures on themselves, or by projecting bolts of moonlight capable of weakening and temporarily draining the strength and energy of their targets). Their voice is also blessed by Eilistraee, it has the power to soothe suspicion, pain, fear and other negative emotions, and to enhance enchantment spells. Only when the death of a drow can directly result in saving the life of others is lethal force permitted, and even then, a silverhair knight has to atone for her act. Although most silverhair knights are female drow or half-drow, any worshipper of Eilistraee ‚Äì regardless of race or gender ‚Äì is welcomed to the order. When the silverhair knights find an encampment of drow, they are expected to observe the group from hiding for some time, learning their ways and personalities from afar, so that they can identify members of the group who might turn from Lolth's ways. Eventually, they are expected to infiltrate the group, identify and approach possible converts, and organize their escape to a safe location. Silverhair knights dwell in out-of-the-way areas and generally avoid cities or other large metropolitan areas unless they are guiding a drow to a sanctuary within.Dragon Magazine, Issue 315 Rituals Priestesses of Eilistraee pray for their spell at the rising of the Moon. The faith and worship of Eilistraee is not bound by hard rules, it is free form expression through dance and song and all that is needed to celebrate her was a moonlit glade (or some kind of light, if in places that can't be reached by moonlight). Faithfuls disrobe and start dancing, seeking their goddess' blessing. However, there are rituals, as described below: ; The Circle of Song Beside free form dancing and singing, the main form of ritual worship of Eilistraee is a hunt for food followed by a feast and a Circle of Song, in which the worshipers sit and dance by turns in a circle, each one in succession leading a song. If possible, the ritual has to be celebrated in a wooden area and on moon-lit nights. ; The Evensong and Flamesong The Evensong is an intimate ritual that all followers of Eilistraee perform at the end of their day. It is a wordless message to their goddess (usually involving a personal dance and song) in which they let out all the emotions, experiences and reflections that they have gathered in the day, so that Eilistraee can listen to them. In the Promenade of Eilistraee this ritual took the particular form of the Flamesong, the most important personal prayer for the Dark Ladies and Maids (priestesses and novices, respectively), in which they danced around a flame or a candle. They would sing freely for their goddess and dance following the rhythm of the music as it came, until the flame was extinguished. Priestesses usually tried to find an alcove or passage where they could be alone to make a Flame Song. While they did, the Promenade was filled with the eerily beautiful echoes of half a dozen or more of these solos at once, drifting down the passages. ; The Hunt and High Hunt The Hunt consists of tracking down and slaying/driving away a monster which represents a threat to the people living in the area. It is held whenever Eilistraee warns her followers of the presence of a peril/dangerous creature in the area (through the sound of her horn), in order to prevent it from hurting travelers or the inhabitants of nearby settlements. Hearing the Dark Maiden's hunting horn can also simply mean that someone nearby is in need of help. Te High Hunt is a night time ritual led by clerics of Eilistraee, in which the faithful hunt a monster or animal as an offering to the goddess. The tradition allows the use of any kind of bladed weapon and armor, but the priestesses are required to wear as little as possible. It is usually held once per season and ends with a circle dance for the goddess if the quarry is slain (coupled with a feast if the quarry is edible). ; The Last Dance Those among the clerics of Eilistraee who do not die in battle are blessed by Eilistraee with the ritual of the Last Dance. In old age, Eilistraee's priests hear the goddess singing to them by night, calling them to her. When the song feels right, they simply start to dance under the moonlit sky, unclad, never to be seen again. Those who observed such dances said that the goddess came and sang to her follower, and that as the aged priest danced, she would gradually gain the strength and energy of youth, looking younger and younger. Her hair began to glow with the same radiance as the Dark Maiden's, and then she would slowly fade away as the dance goes on. In the end, only a silvery radiance was seen and two voices ‚Äì the goddess and her priest ‚Äì were heard, raised together in a melancholy, tender song. ; The Run The Run is a ritual that followers of Eilistraee undertake at least once per year. All those who take part in the ritual use particular boiled leaves and berries to make their hair silvery (which usually leads to sarcastic remarks from some drow of other faiths, who enjoy saying that such a color is to indicate their foolishness, although drow who do not worship Eilistraee can also have silver hair) and those who are not drow use natural colors to paint their bodies black. After this preparation, they go on a travel, wandering on the surface world, trusting to their music, kind ways, and sword skills to keep them from being slain as drow. The goal of the travel is for the followers of the Dark Maiden to go where they are strangers, reaching to elven and other races' communities to bring them food, joy (through music and dance), kindness and help of various kinds, not to preach their faith, but simply out of good heart and to show (together with their day-to-day activities) that drow can be rightful non-evil inhabitants of Faerun. Of course, the faithful are encouraged to use this time to also learn (and/or pass on) new songs, music, recipes and sword techniques. ; The Sword Dance The Sword Dance is a ritual held when a new sword is forged or acquired by a worshipper of Eilistraee, in order to ask her blessing on the blade. It is performed by planting the weapon in the ground (the point turned down) and dancing, drawing a drop of blood from each of the priestess' limbs, moving momentarily against the blade. If the ritual is successful, the sword will gleam with silvery light, and for three months it won't rust and will be able to hit creatures that can only be wounded by magic. Magic ; The Spellsong The Spellsong is the ability to invoke a wide variety of magical effects through song and music, including replicating other spells, protecting from magic or healing. If more priestesses take part to a Spellsong, its power grows and become able to regenerate lost limbs or cure a wide variety of illnesses, poisons or other negative effects. This kind of magic is particularly common among the Sword Dancers of Eilistraee. A particular form of Spellsong is the Grand Chorus, celebrated by the priestesses of the temple of the Promenade of Eilistraee. This is the greatest ritual of worship to Eilistraee, an ever-changing song of celebration led by a senior priestess who guides the song with an overriding theme or melody. The Chorus could bring into being beams of moonlight, which intensity grows with the emotion of the singers. If such radiance meets with real moonlight, Eilistraee's power will make it so that all beings and items that the priestesses are touching or carrying while singing can, at will, be transported along a web of moonlight for as far as it reaches. In that way they can move from the location of the Chorus to any place on the surface lit by the moon and it is through this spell that the priestesses would travel to the surface for their missions. ; Eilistraee's Moonfire The most iconic Eilistraeen spell is the Dark Maiden's Moonfire. It is a beacon of light, whose intensity and color can be controlled by the creator at will (ranging from a faint glow to a clear, bright ‚Äì but not blinding ‚Äì light). The radiance is bound to the creator, and can be moved and shaped around their body at will, and as fast as desired. Moonfire has the same intensity as moonlight, and it is generally used as a light source for reading, to see in the dark, as a signal for communication or for artistic purposes. More experienced clerics can move the moonfire away from their bodies, like the spell dancing lights. The caster can guide it in any direction, through any opening, and cause the glow to appear in any size, up to a volume determined by their power. Eilistraee can also occasionally choose to gift any creature the power to temporarily manifest her moonfire. Equipment ; Ceremonial Garb Priestesses of Eilistraee generally wear their hair long (as a tribute to the goddess), but they have no specific ceremonial garb; instead, they are supposed to wear as little as possible during their official ceremonies. ; Dresses and Armor When relaxing, the priestesses prefer silver, diaphanous gowns, but for their work or when they have to fight they still use the most appropriate garb for the situation (like armor, preferably magical and of drow make, in battle, haprons for cooking and leather garb for hunting). ; Holy symbols The holy symbols of the faith vary, and include a silver sword pendant the size of a hand, a silver bastard sword outlined against a silver moon with silvery filaments, and a nude long-haired female drow dancing with a silver sword in front of a full moon. These are often worn as a pin or hung around the neck by means of a slender silver or mithril chain. ; Weapons In battle, the priestesses have to wield swords when possible, and bladed weapons are preferred to other instruments when swords are not available. Longbows and silver-tipped arrows are usually used as secondary weapons. ; Relics The most known Eilistraeen relics are the Singing Swords: twenty magical singing silver bastard swords provided by Eilistraee, once wielded by Qilue Veladorn and the Chosen of Eilistraee who patrolled the Pit of Ghaunadaur near Skullport. The swords sing constantly (and loudly) when unsheathed, and lose their abilities and bonuses when silenced. The blade's song makes its wielder confident and immune to charm, command, confusion, fear, friends, repulsion, scare and suggestion. An emotion cast on the wielder only causes rage, focused on the one who cast the emotion spell. The sword's song also cancels the effects of a harpy's song, silences shriekers, and can entrance weak, earthly, living creatures, although this ability can be negated by a bard's counter-song. Temples Temples of the Dark Maiden are typically established in the mouths of caverns or in woodlands, places that allow her followers to reach and act on the surface world. Temples in the Underdark ‚Äì even shrines close to the surface ‚Äì are unusual and the Promenade of the Dark Maiden is unique in being a large center of worship of the Dark Dancer, the main one, founded in the caverns of the Undermountain, to prevent the return of Ghaunadaur. Eilistraee's places of worship are chosen mostly like elves choose spots to dedicate to the Seldarine: followers of Eilistraee use natural places that need little modification and tend to live in harmony with their surroundings, leaving few traces of their passage, with only few exceptions (like the drow of the Promeande of the Dark Maiden).Dragon Magazine, issue 176 Temples typically include a glade in which to dance and from which the moon is fully visible, a dark place removed from the light of day, a thick tree canopy, a fresh water stream, a forge for the crafting of swords, an access tunnel to the Underdark, and a vein of iron or some other metal suitable for the craft. However, all of that is not necessary, as a shrine of the Dark Maiden only requires a moonlit glade and a song capable of leading one into a dance. Notable followers Two of the most popular Eilistraee followers in the Forgotten Realms novels are Liriel Baenre and Qilu√© of The Seven Sisters. Halisstra Melarn, the Lady Pentinent, was also a priestess of the Dark Maiden during the Silence of Lolth. Solaufein, a major NPC in Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, is also a follower of Eilistraee.  Background  Eilistraee was first created for the original home campaign run by Ed Greenwood himself, appearing by manifestation, dream vision, and in person. At the behest of editor Newton Ewell, who wanted a deity for good drow in the game, Greenwood used the opportunity to make the Dark Dancer official and added Eilistraee to The Drow of the Underdark (1991) and thus to the official Forgotten Realms. Greenwood designed Eilistraee as a nurturing mother goddess and a fertility goddess. The popular dancing-naked-under-moonlight aspect of the goddess and her faith was inspired by British traditions of fairies, and was intended to show her as non-warlike and non-violent, rather than capricious. She could be a protectress of her people and a terrific sword dancer, but she was intended to be a bard, not a huntress herself, only encouraging these skills in her followers, in order to help them survive on the surface. Neither was she a moon goddess, only one found under the moon as drow stole onto the surface at night. However, by association, the official Eilistraee acquired such skills and powers herself under later writers and development. Ed Greenwood denies a connection to Artemis/Diana of Greek and Roman mythology, though the later development appears to have made the official Eilistraee a little more similar.  Reception  Rob Bricken of Kotaku identified Eilistraee as one of \\"The 13 Strangest Deities in Dungeons & Dragons\\", commenting: \\"To know Eilistraee, you have to know the Drow. The Drow are a race of evil elves who live underground and basically spend all their days murdering each other because they're so damn evil. There has been one good Drow in the history of D&D;, and that's Drizzt Do'Urden, who is one of the Mary Sue-iest characters in all of fiction‚Äîand he's been the star of countless novels and is the only reason any D&D; player has even been interested in the Drow, of which now there is a terrifying amount of material. Anyways, Eilistraee is apparently the goddess of good Drow, which means she has one worshipper on the planet. This is nonsense.\\"  Trivia  * In the computer game Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark, Eilistraee's followers stand at the forefront of the ragtag rebel army's fight against the evil Valsharess. A mysterious priestess of Eilistraee known as the Seer leads a small band of Eilistraeen drow in an abandoned Lolthian temple, located in the Underdark port city of Lith My'athar. * In the computer game Neverwinter Nights 2 and its expansions, Eilistraee is one of the deities that can be chosen by the player during character creation * In the computer game Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, Eilistraee is mentioned through one of her followers in the drow city of Ust Natha, Solaufein. * In the board game Lords of Waterdeep, one of the quest cards available to the players is called \\"Protect converts to Eilistraee\\". The following quote can be found on the card: The Dark Lady smiles on those who see the deeper beauty within.

Desi hip hop is a term for music and culture which combines the influences of hip hop and the Indian subcontinent; the term desi referring to the South Asian diaspora. The term has also come to be used as an alternative for rap music and even pop music which involves rappers of South Asian origins.  Overview  Apache Indian, UK artist of Indian origin, was the earliest to make an impact on the UK charts with a series of hits during the nineties.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.13 Baba Sehgal introduced Hindi rap in the nineties with his albums. His album Thanda Thanda Pani (1992) sold 100,000 copies in three and a half months and brought rap music to the Indian club scene. In the 2000s the desi hop scene remained limited largely to the underground, with a very niche loyal audience. Hip-hop culture, including graffiti and b-boying started seeping into the club scene and street culture of big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Ashok Kumar‚Äôs recitation of Harindranath Chattopadhyay‚Äôs poem Rail Gaadi is considered to be one of the first rap songs in Bollywood. It was featured in the film Aashirwad (1968). In the 1990s rap started getting popular following the success of Baba Sehgal‚Äôs album Thanda Thanda Paani. One of the early moments of Indian hip hop was the Bengali-language underground film Gandu which narrated a story of a rapper and had a soundtrack which mixed rap with alternative rock. Besides Bollywood and commercial rap music, the underground hip-hop scene started shaping. Many emerging rappers, crews started to create a buzz in the underground hip-hop scene. In north India groups like 2 ShadeZ, Desi Beam , while in south Machas With Attitude, Hiphop Tamizha, Street Academics pioneered respective vernacular rap music scenes. In Mumbai Mumbai's Finest, Bombay Bassment, Gully Gang became popular. There was increased interest in the rap genre in India after 2011, with many rappers emerging from across the country. This is largely credited to the success of Yo Yo Honey Singh in India and Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry. Following huge success of his album International Villager, Singh went on to release several hits songs both in independently and in Bollywood. In the wake of success of Honey Singh, a new trend was formed in Bollywood with many producers roping in rap artists for their songs. Even some big Bollywood actors like Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan tried their hands at rapping. Indian hip hop has picked up steam in the suburbs of India's biggest cities creating big names like Divine, Emiway Bantai, Naezy, Muhfaad, Raga & Raftaar who have been picked up by talent management agencies like OML who now have music videos with millions of views on YouTube. Down in the scene, rappers like Brodha V and KR$NA have kept the flag of the Indian hip hop flying high. Due to the exposure through Bollywood, rap became a household term and an increased production of rap music was observed, especially in the Punjabi music industry. There is an ongoing debate among the hip-hop community about the contribution of Honey Singh to the genre. While some artists including Badshah, Ikka, Deep Money, Manj Musik and Bohemia have acknowledged his contribution to the industry, others like Raftaar, some Pakistani artists and Imran Khan have openly denied it. There is also a negative sentiment among some followers of hip-hop culture in India regarding the recent commercialization of the genre. Even though many fans are not happy with the recent commercialization of hip-hop in India, this commercialization has also led to expansion of the underground scene, with independent artists building a name in Indian hip hop. Because of this, the future of hip-hop in India is generally perceived to be positive. There are many rappers in India, rapping in different languages like Odia, Punjabi, Marathi, Bengali, Hindi, Bhojpuri, Khasi etc. Tamil hip hop is getting popular in India. Artists like Brodha V, Dopeadelicz and Yogi B are known for their acts in Tamil language. Many other south Indian languages like Kannada, Telugu and Marathi is also becoming popular among masses in India.  Protest hip hop  Protest music has invariably found its way within Indian hip-hop from the early years. Blaaze's track 'Ban the Crooked Police' was an early track, while Delhi Sultante's side-project Word Sound Power paved the way for socially conscious protest music wherein he work with folk musicians from Orissa and Punjab to craft a mix of reggae, dub and Indian folk sounds. Protest hip hop came into limelight after mass protest started all over India against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019. Since the crackdown in JMI, AMU and JNU, and the 2020 Delhi riots several rappers from all over the country have joined the cause with their own sonic protest. Rappers like Madara, Rapper Shaz, Santhanam Srinivasan Iyer (EPR), Ahmer and Sumit Roy gained recognition for their protest songs.

The Casshern franchise also includes a 1993 original video animation titled Casshan: Robot Hunter, and a 2004 live-action adaptation titled Casshern. In October 2008, a reboot of the franchise Casshern Sins premiered. In anticipation of the upcoming series, a DVD box set of the original series, Neo-Human Casshern Complete DVD-Box \\"All Episodes of Casshern\\", was released in Japan on September 24, 2008. Casshern also appears in Tatsunoko Fight and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars as a playable character. At Anime Expo 2013, Sentai Filmworks announced that they had signed a deal with Tatsunoko to release some of their catalog, with Casshan being confirmed as one of the characters involved. Sentai Filmworks released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on March 4, 2014. Plot , also known as Casshern, is an android with a human consciousness, also known as a . Tetsuya turned himself into an android to hunt down and destroy the robots that have taken over the world. His biological father, Dr. Kotaro Azuma, was the inventor of the automatons that were originally intended to serve humankind. However, the first android, BK-1, was struck by lightning and went out of control. Despite great efforts to stop it, BK-1 used its great strength to escape from the castle. After some time, it renamed itself Buraiking Boss (often mistranslated in English as \\"Black King Boss\\"; the name is derived from ÁÑ°È†º or burai, meaning rogue or brute, using the symbols for \\"trust\\" and \\"nothing,\\" but phonetically \\"Bu Rai\\" can mean \\"Lightning Man\\" or \\"Lightning Warrior,\\" so the name fits with his background). The Buraiking Boss then built a robot army against mankind. The robots mutinied en masse when they logically concluded that the good of the Earth's ecosystem required the destruction of the human race. Casshern and his robotic dog, Friender, join forces with a beautiful girl named Luna Kozuki to battle the robots led by the Buraiking Boss. Friender can transform itself into a tank or a jet aircraft and actively helps Casshern fight the robot army. Casshern has great strength and agility, but he is not armed, except for a pair of strange pistols, which are used more like rockets than weapons. While the robots are huge and robust machines, almost all of them have an antenna on top of their heads; ripping it off usually causes them to explode, so they are relatively vulnerable. Casshern can usually destroy the robots with his bare hands, dispatching a great number in any given battle. However, Casshern also has some weak points. His body must be re-charged with solar energy and cannot sustain very long battles without risking low battery power. Luna started out as being totally harmless, until her father built an electromagnetic pistol, which was easily capable of destroying the robots.

Both the Japanese and English versions of the official Tatsunoko website use Casshan for the romanized title of the original 1973 series. Advertising for Tatsunoko's Infini-T Force contains the Casshan name in several instances. Italian versions of the series romanize the name as \\"Kyashan,\\" resembling the literal pronunciation of the Japanese title. Legacy In Vanquish, developed by PlatinumGames, the art style is based on Casshern. In one of the boss fights the main character drills through a robot by spinning in place at high speed, similarly to Casshern. Concerning the game's development, director Shinji Mikami is quoted as saying: > \\"I was inspired by Casshern, so I wanted to make a game like that. If I went > ahead and made the exact game I wanted, it probably would have been like > Casshern, where you punch and kick the entire way through.

So now, you're going at it > with guns, but he wanted to make sure the feeling of speed is still there, > that was really important to him, so that's why he introduced the element of > the sliding boost.\\" In addition, the protagonist of Vanquish has a facemask that periodically comes off to show his human side, much like Casshern himself. According to one of the game's character modelers, Yoshifumi Hattori, a support robotic companion dog was designed to fight along with the main character, including transforming into ability-enhancing armor. Although this dog was successfully modeled, it was cut from the finalized version of the game, along with another female android partner character. Raiden from Metal Gear Solid 4 is also dressed like Casshern.

Biography Richard Tangye was born at Illogan, near Redruth, Cornwall, the son of a shopkeeper and farmer. As a young boy he worked in the fields, but when he was eight years old he was incapacitated from further manual labour by a fracture of the right arm. His father then determined to give him the best education he could afford, and young Tangye was sent to the Quaker Sidcot School in the Mendip Hills near the village of Winscombe, Somerset, where he progressed rapidly and became a pupil-teacher. Career Tangye disliked this role, and through an advertisement in The Friend obtained a clerkship in a small engineering firm in Birmingham, where two of his brothers, skilled mechanics, subsequently joined him. Here Richard Tangye remained four years, obtaining a complete mastery of the details of an engineering business, and introducing the system of a Saturday half-holiday which he had supported on its introduction by John Frearson, the radical Birmingham Engineer. It was subsequently adopted in many English industrial works. Tangye Ltd In 1856, Tangye started business in a small way in Birmingham as a hardware factor and commission agent. His first customers were the Cornish mine-owners in the Redruth district. In March 1857, Richard Tangye, with brothers James and Joseph, started a manufacturing business in Mount Street under the title of James Tangye and Bros. Principally manufacturing hydraulic appliances and particularly lifting jacks, on 31 January 1858, their jacks were successfully employed in the launching of Brunel's steamship . Tangye said of the project: In 1859, brothers Edward and George joined, together with George Price. The company acquired the patent of the differential pulley-block in 1861, and in 1862 James Tangye invented the Tangye Patent Hydraulic Jack. This resulted in the 1862 purchase and demolition of Soho-located Smethwick Hall, on the site of which was built the Cornwall Works. In 1867 the patent for a new type of Direct-acting Steam Pump was acquired, and in 1870 the company commenced the manufacture of steam engines. The company was commissioned to design the hydraulic systems for the UK's first funicular cliff railway in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, in 1869. After completing another in Scarborough, they employed George Croydon Marks as head of lifts, in which capacity he designed the 1883 Saltburn Cliff Lift, which today is the oldest water-powered cliff railway in the United Kingdom. In 1872, the two youngest brothers, Richard and George, became sole proprietors. They developed the company internationally, opening offices in Johannesburg and Sydney. The first gas engine, a 1 nominal horsepower two- cycle type, was sold in 1881, and in 1890 the firm commenced manufacture of the four-cycle gas engine. Incorporated as a limited company from 1881, in 1894 they produced their first hot bulb engine. Richard Tangye was knighted in 1894. Tangye travelled extensively, visiting Australia more than once and also New Zealand and America. He sought to restore his health on the ocean voyages but his main purpose in going to these countries was to expand his business. His accounts of his travels reveal a man who was annoyed that he was not shown the deference by hotel employees that he enjoyed in Britain and who was often unimpressed by the food he was presented with (excluding the fruit, which he greatly liked) - but who enjoyed being recognised and was pleased when he saw evidence of progress e.g. in the establishment of libraries. Philanthropy Richard Tangye and his brother George were founding benefactors of Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in 1885, which today has a collection of international importance covering fine art, ceramics, metalwork, jewellery, archaeology, ethnography, local history and industrial history. They also helped found Birmingham School of Art. Tangye was a noted collector of Oliver Cromwell manuscripts and memorabilia. His collection included many rare manuscripts and printed books, medals, paintings, objets d'art and a bizarre assemblage of 'relics'. The 'relics' included Cromwell's Bible, button, coffin plate, death mask and funeral escutcheon. On Tangye's death, the entire collection was donated to the Museum of London, where it can still be seen today. Items from the Tangye Collection are also to be found at the Cromwell Museum. Personal life Aerial View of Cornwall Works, circa 1909. The cover of Tangye's autobiography \\"One and All\\" Married, Tangye lived in Birmingham, and latterly London, but often returned to his cliff-edge house in Newquay, Cornwall. Richard Tangye has been described by his biographer as a man of great resolve with considerable talents for promoting his business, but also very much valuing his privacy and never wishing to hold public office in Birmingham. (Stephen Roberts, 'Sir Richard Tangye 1833-1906: A Cornish Entrepreneur in Victorian Birmingham, 2015). He was the grandfather of the authors Derek Tangye and Nigel Tangye. Through his niece Helena Tangye Lean, he was a great-uncle of film maker David Lean and his brother Edward Tangye Lean, founder of the Inklings. After death After the deaths of Richard (1906) and George (1920), with the family owning the majority of shares, their sons entered the business. In 1919, the company started production of large- scale industrial diesel engines, pumps and hydraulic equipment. Engine production was stopped after World War II, with the company concentrating on hydraulic pumps, valves and related systems. Publications Tangye wrote an autobiography, One and All (1889). The only modern study is Sir Richard Tangye 1833-1914: A Cornish Entrepreneur in Victorian Birmingham (2015) by Stephen Roberts. Examples of Tangye engines The various engines had an elegance as well as being functional. Here are some examples in various museums.

Cardozo School of Law is the law school of Yeshiva University, located in New York City. The school, founded in 1976, is named for Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. Among the top 100 law schools, only three schools are younger than Cardozo, which graduated its first class in 1979. Cardozo is currently ranked 53rd by U.S. News and World Report ranking of law schools and 22nd in part-time law schools. Its intellectual property program was ranked 12th in the nation, and its dispute resolution program was ranked 6th. The Cardozo faculty is ranked #32 in the nation for scholarly impact. The school's other notable programs include the FAME Center for fashion, arts, media & entertainment; the Data Law Initiative; the Blockchain Project; Cardozo/Google Patent Diversity Project; the Cardozo Law Institute in Holocaust and Human Rights; and the Heyman Center on Corporate Governance. Students can choose to participate in clinics such as the Tech Startup Clinic, Immigration Justice Clinic, Innocence Project Clinic, Benjamin B. Ferencz Human Rights and Atrocity Prevention Clinic, and the Civil Rights Clinic. The school also created the Innocence Project, run by Cardozo Professor Barry Scheck, which has used DNA profiling to help free innocent prisoners. The project's work has been instrumental in some high-profile cases. In 1999 Cardozo became a member of the Order of the Coif, an honor society for law scholars. Cardozo has seven faculty members who have clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and Cardozo has had two graduates chosen to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court. Cardozo was the second U.S. law school to secure an invitation to The European Law Moot Court Competition, and the first American law school to be invited twice consecutively. Many of Cardozo's 12,000 alumni reside in the New York metropolitan area, while many pursue their careers internationally and can be found across the country. In 2019, 83% of the law school's first-time test takers passed the bar exam, placing the law school seventh-best among New York's 15 law schools. According to Cardozo's 2017 ABA- required disclosures, 80.14% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long- term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.Benjamin N.

Location and facilities  Located on lower Fifth Avenue at the corner of 12th Street in New York City‚Äôs Greenwich Village, Cardozo's urban campus is in a large building, known as the Brookdale Center. A multimillion-dollar capital improvement plan took place in 2006. The addition of more space at the Brookdale Center also allowed for a larger and significantly enhanced library, new offices and clinic spaces, as well as a new and larger lobby, moot court room, and ground-floor seminar room. In addition, older classrooms were renovated. In fall 2006, the Greenberg Center for Student Life, given in honor of former Dean David Rudenstine, opened. This addition to Cardozo included a new student lounge and a cafe on the third floor. Also completed were several new seminar rooms, internal stairways between floors, and windows on every floor.

In the serial, the time traveller the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury) work with the Dulcians of the planet Dulkis to prevent the alien Dominators from blowing up Dulkis and using its irradiated remains as spaceship fuel. Plot An alien craft bearing the ruthless Dominators arrives on the peaceful planet of Dulkis. The craft lands on the Island of Death, a nuclear test site housing an anti-war museum, and soon absorbs all the radiation on the island. The robotic Quarks are sent out by the Dominators to prepare boreholes into the planet‚Äôs crust in order to convert the planet into rocket fuel. Toba uses the Quarks to fire on and kill three adventure seekers who stumble across his project. Their pilot Cully, however, survives by hiding, though the craft that brought him to the island is destroyed. Rago is furious that these potential slaves have been wasted. The TARDIS arrives on another part of the island and the Doctor and his companions Jamie and Zoe hear the explosion of the craft being destroyed. They take shelter in the museum and meet three other newly arrived Dulcians, Educator Balan and his young charges Teel and Kando. All are puzzled that the radiation reading on the Island is nil, since it should be radioactive after the nuclear explosion 172 years earlier. Cully arrives too, and tells them about the murderous Dominators and their robots. Balan does not accept this: Cully, the son of the Director of the ruling council, is well-known as a practical joker. The Quarks have begun work on drilling the outer boreholes. The Doctor and Jamie are captured by a patrol of Quarks and taken to the Dominator ship for questioning and scanning. A scan of Jamie is presumed to apply to them both and to the Dulcian race as a whole, who are thus described as possible but not definite for conversion into a slave force. During an intelligence test, the Doctor feigns stupidity to prove their worthlessness. He also fails to use a weapon from the Dulcian museum, falsely claiming such military technology has been lost to the Dulcians. The Doctor and Jamie are freed as worthless idiots. Cully has contacted his father, Director Senex, who orders him to recharge Balan‚Äôs travel capsule and use it to return to the Capital City. He takes Zoe with him to the Council Chamber, where the discussion lacks focus and purpose. Senex refuses to believe that Cully is telling the truth, despite Zoe‚Äôs protests, so Cully steals a travel pod and heads back to the island with Zoe to get proof of their story. The Doctor and Jamie take Balan‚Äôs pod to the capital city. They are angry that Cully and Zoe have been allowed to return to danger and have real trouble convincing the Council of the Dominators' threat. The true danger is only revealed when the Council obtains a visual image of a survey station destroyed by the Quarks on Toba‚Äôs instructions. The Dominators capture Balan, Teel and Kando, using them for further tests on their species before they are made to work as slaves in the drilling sites. Zoe and Cully are also captured and enslaved but find Balan and Kando opposed to using force against the Quarks. However, they struggle to dig the borehole, with Balan collapsing. Cully sneaks back to the museum and captures a laser weapon stored there as an exhibit. The Doctor and Jamie take control of a travel pod and return to the Island of Death. Jamie links up with Cully at the museum while the Doctor is captured by Quarks and taken with the slave force back to the Dominator ship. Cully uses the gun to destroy a Quark, prompting another of Toba‚Äôs rages. The museum is destroyed in retaliation, which infuriates Rago. He orders the Quarks to hold the Doctor and Zoe for further tests while Balan, Kando, and Teel are sent to excavate to the central bore site. Jamie and Cully survive the explosion in a nuclear bunker below the main building. After a struggle they open a hatch above them and succeed in crushing a Quark with a boulder. This alerts Toba who heads off to investigate how another Quark has been destroyed, leaving the Doctor and Zoe free to roam the Dominator ship. Jamie and Cully continue to attack other Quarks in a series of guerrilla raids. The Dulcian Council debates the situation and not even Tensa, Chairman of the Emergencies Committee, can spur them into decisive action. The key moment comes when Rago himself uses the travel pod taken by the Doctor to travel to the capital with a Quark. The robot kills Tensa on command. Rago says that the fittest Dulcians will be enslaved to use on the Dominator homeworld. The rest will be left on Dulkis to die, as the planet is doomed. Toba returns to the ship and demands to know who destroyed the Quark. Balan is killed for refusing to answer, and the Doctor is selected to die next. Rago returns and sends Toba to complete the drilling and prepare the bore rockets, using the Quarks and the Doctor, Zoe, Teel and Kando as slaves. Rago focuses on a precious seed device to be dropped down the central borehole. He also hears from the Fleet Leader that no Dulcian slave force is to be assembled: all the Dulcians are now to stay on the planet to die when it is destroyed. The dig proceeds with the Doctor and the other slaves making progress, but when Toba abandons his watch post Jamie and Cully disable another Quark and free their friends. The Doctor has worked out the Dominator scheme: a nuclear fission seed will be dropped down the borehole, converting the entire planet into a radioactive mass to power the Dominator fleet. They begin digging a tunnel to the central borehole to steal the deadly device before it can detonate. Jamie and Cully help by destroying Quarks with homemade bombs. The Doctor intercepts the seed during its descent but tells his friends that it cannot be defused. Cully, Teel and Kando are told to flee in the remaining travel pod, while Jamie and Zoe are sent to the TARDIS. The Doctor runs to the Dominator ship and smuggles the seed on board before the craft lifts off. It departs and the Dominators‚Äô last vision is of the seed device rolling on the floor toward them. The Doctor watches the Dominator ship being destroyed and then heads back to the TARDIS which departs in a hurry to avoid the advancing lava flows from the new volcanoes. Production Episode 3 had no on-screen episode number caption. The Quarks were created as an attempt to create a monster with the same merchandising potential as the popular Daleks. The pacifist Dulcians were originally conceived as a satire on the 1960s hippie subculture. This serial was originally composed of six episodes, but it was deemed too short of content and reduced to five at the last minute. Producer Peter Bryant ordered Haisman and Lincoln to abandon writing the sixth episode and script editor Derrick Sherwin rewrote the fifth episode to provide a conclusion. Haisman and Lincoln were not informed of this, or of the BBC's merchandising of the Quarks, which led to their refusal to write for the series again. Subsequently, an additional episode had to be penned for the following The Mind Robber, also making that story five parts. Wrotham Quarry in Addington, Kent doubles as the planet surface of Dulkis. Patrick Troughton was absent from all of the location filming sessions. A double plays the role of the Doctor in all the location footage, his face being clearly visible in some shots.Doctor Who ‚Äì The Dominators DVD. BBC Time Warner. January 11, 2011.

Philip Voss had previously played Acomat in Marco Polo (1964). Broadcast and reception The BBC Audience Research Report for The Dominators showed that much of the sample dismissed the serial as unsurprising as it followed a known pattern, though a third felt that it was still inventive. In The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the serial treated the issues of the time‚Äîlike hippies and unilateralism‚Äîwith \\"disdain\\", and the story was also \\"very dull\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called the serial \\"a disappointingly lacklustre start to the sixth season\\". They found it hard for the viewer to care about the Dulcians, but said the Dominators were \\"hardly amongst the best of the series' alien creations, [but] at least quite well realised on screen\\". In 2009, Mark Braxton of Radio Times described the serial as lazy in production with \\"hopeless\\" cliffhangers and a lack of audience identification. He wrote that the few small \\"saving graces\\" were the appearance of the Quarks and the pyrotechnics. Reviewing the serial for SFX, Ian Berriman gave The Dominators a rating of two out of five stars. He wrote that the plot did not have much and was \\"push-button and pedestrian\\", with the best thing being Troughton. DVD Talk's John Sinnott was more positive, giving the story three out of five stars. He criticised the \\"talky beginning\\" and non-frightening Quarks, but felt that it was a \\"wonderful romp\\" due to the TARDIS crew. Commercial releases=In print A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published by Target Books in April 1984. Home media The Dominators was released on VHS in 1990. It was released on CD on 7 May 2007, and as a DVD in the UK on 12 July 2010 and in the USA and Canada on 11 January 2011.

He is largely responsible for pioneering the widespread commercialization of local area network (LAN) technology to connect geographically disparate computers over a multiprotocol router system, which was an unheard-of technology at the time.

Accessed December 30, 2010. Background Born in Pennsylvania in 1952 to Polish Catholic family, Bosack graduated from La Salle College High School in 1969. In 1973, Bosack graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and joined the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) as a hardware engineer. In 1979, he was accepted into Stanford University, and began to study computer science. During his time at Stanford, he was credited for becoming a support engineer for a 1981 project to connect all of Stanford's mainframes, minis, LISP machines, and Altos. His contribution was to work on the network router that allowed the computer network under his management to share data from the Computer Science Lab with the Business School's network. He met his wife Sandra Lerner at Stanford, where she was the manager of the Business School lab, and the couple married in 1980.\\"Does Pink Make you Puke?\\". Forbes. Accessed December 30, 2010. Together in 1984, they started Cisco in Menlo Park. Cisco In 1984, Bosack co-founded Cisco Systems with his then partner (and now ex-wife) Sandy Lerner. Their aim was to commercialize the Advanced Gateway Server. The Advanced Gateway Server was a revised version of the Stanford router built by William Yeager and Andy Bechtolsheim. Bosack and Lerner designed and built routers in their house, and experimented using Stanford's network. Initially, Bosack and Lerner went to Stanford with a proposition to start building and selling the routers, but the school refused. It was then that they founded their own company, and named it \\"Cisco,\\" taken from the name of nearby San Francisco.\\"Adult Supervision\\". Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Accessed December 30, 2010. It is widely reported that Lerner and Bosack designed the first router so that they could connect the incompatible computer systems of the Stanford offices they were working in so that they could send letters to each other. However, this is an untrue legend. Cisco's product was developed in their garage and was sold beginning in 1986 by word of mouth. In their first month alone, Cisco was able to land contracts worth more than $200,000. The company produced revolutionary technology such as the first multiport router-specific line cards and sophisticated routing protocols, giving them domination over the market-place. Cisco went public in 1990, the same year that Bosack resigned. Bosack and Lerner walked away from Cisco with $170 million after being forced out by the professional managers the firm's venture capitalists brought in. Bosack and Lerner divorced in the early 1990s. In 1996, Cisco's revenues amounted to $5.4 billion, making it one of Silicon Valley's biggest success stories. In 1998, the company was valued at over $6 billion and controlled over three-quarters of the router business. Achievements Along with co-founding Cisco Systems, Bosack is largely responsible for first pioneering the widespread commercialization of local area network (LAN). He and his fellow staff members at Stanford were able to successfully link the university's 5,000 computers across a campus area. This contribution is significant in its context because, at that time, technology like that which LAN used was unheard of. Their challenge had been to overcome incompatibility issues, in order to create the first true LAN system. Bosack has also held significant technical leadership roles at AT&T; Bell Labs and the Digital Equipment Corporation. After earning his master's degree in computer science from Stanford University, he became Director of Computer Facilities for the university's Department of Computer Science. He became a key contributor to the emerging ARPAnet, which was the beginning of today's Internet. Bosack's most recent technological advancements include his creation of new in-line fiber optic amplification systems that are capable of achieving unprecedented data transmission latency speeds of 6.071 milliseconds (fiber plus equipment latency, fiber latency alone would be at least 4.106 milliseconds based on the speed of light) over 1231 kilometers of fiber, which is roughly the distance between Chicago and New York City. Bosack was inspired by his belief that by leveraging the inherent, but often untapped, physics of fiber optic components, data transmission speeds can be increased with devices that use less power, less space and require less cooling. Charity Together, Bosack and Lerner have a charitable foundation and trust funded with 70% of the money from the sale of their Cisco stock. The foundation is recognized for financing a wide range of animal welfare and science projects, such as The Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington.\\"Center for Conservation Biology\\".

It is in the Six Mile Water Valley, about two miles south-west of Ballyclare, and had a population of 1,130 people in the 2001 Census. It is known as Doach in Scots.The Online Scots Dictionary Retrieved 20 August 2012. Traditional houses stand in the village centre but the village has gradually grown and new housing estates have been built on its outskirts. The first Sunday school in Ireland was alleged to have been held in Doagh on the site where the Methodist Church now stands, although there is no firm evidence to support this claim. The Methodist church was established in 1844. There are a number of buildings of architectural interest either in or proximate to the village.(Reference Brett, CEB, O'Connell, M. Buildings of County Antrim, Belfast. Ulster Architectural Heritage Society. 1996. ) These include Fisherwick Lodge - a hunting lodge built for the Marquess of Donegall (1805), and Holestone House. Industrial architecture is well represented in some of the remaining mill buildings - the best at nearby Cogry (Reference, McCutcheon, W, A., The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland, Belfast, Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, 1981). There is evidence of settlement in the vicinity at least from the Iron Age, and possibly the Bronze Age - as represented by the Holestone (places of interest, below) and traces of numerous souterrains in the surrounding fields. This is a substantial base of a Norman motte - overlooking the six mile water - is clearly visible at Lindsay's corner on the outskirts of the village. The cemetery at Kilbride (a townland bearing the name of St Brigid) contains the 19th century Stephenson Mausoleum - a listed building in the style of a mogul palace - and numerous gravestones reflecting a history of emigration and war. In this cemetery is the headstone of William Gault, the founder of the aforementioned Sunday school and a person associated with the Doagh Book Club and radical 18th century Protestantism. (The book club was destroyed by a detachment of Dragoons in the early 19th century).  Places of interest  On a hilltop about a mile from Doagh is a Bronze Age whinstone megalith known as The Holestone. Couples used to promise marriage by clasping hands through the hole in the stone, a convention that can be traced back to about 1830. W.G. Wood-Martin in 1902 asserted that it was anciently ‚Äúconnected with aphrodisiac customs.‚Äù Even today, newlyweds, together with the wedding party, will visit the stone in observance of the ancient local custom. Many new houses have been built in the last number of years, modernising the village.  People  A memorial to John Rowan stands in the middle of the village. Rowan, a linen spinner who invented a steam driven vehicle later claimed to be the first motorcar, was born in Doagh in 1787 and died in Belfast in 1858.  Transport  Doagh was formerly the terminus of a branch line of the narrow gauge Ballymena and Larne Railway. The line was extended from Ballyclare to Doagh in 1884.

Biography  Haag's father, Albert Haag, was a Gymnasium teacher in mathematics. His mother was the writer and politician Anna Haag. Haag stayed in England at the beginning of World War II and was interned as an enemy alien in Canada, where he studied self-taught physics and mathematics. From 1946, he studied at the Technical University in Stuttgart, where he graduated as a physicist in 1948. In 1951 he received his doctorate at the University of Munich under the supervision of Fritz Bopp (Die korrespondenzm√§√üige Methode in der Theorie der Elementarteilchen) and completed his habilitation in 1954 (Zur relativistischen Quantentheorie wechselwirkender Teilchen). From 1951 to 1953, he was an assistant at the University of Munich (from 1954 as a private lecturer) and in 1953/54 he attended the theory group at CERN, which at that time was still based in CopenhagenPoggendorff Lit.-Biogr. Handw√∂rterbuch Exakten Wiss., 1958.. In 1956/1957, he worked with Werner Heisenberg at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in G√∂ttingen. After being a visiting professor at Princeton University and at the Universit√© de Marseille, he became professor of Physics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Afterwards, he was professor for theoretical physics at the Universit√§t Hamburg until his retirement in 1987. After his retirement, he moved to the Schliersee, where he worked on the concept of events in quantum physics until his death. Together with Res Jost, Haag was the founder and, from 1965 to 1973, the first editor of the leading journal Communications in Mathematical Physics. Among his students are: Huzihiro Araki, Detlev Buchholz, Volker En√ü, Klaus Fredenhagen, and Bert Schroer.  Academic career  Even at the beginning of his career, Haag contributed significantly to the concepts of quantum field theory, including Haag's theoremHaag's theorem states that the usual Fock space representation cannot be used to describe interacting relativistic quantum fields with canonical commutation relations. One needs inequivalent Hilbert space representations of fields; see also Encyclopedia of Mathematics.. From this theorem it follows that the interaction picture of quantum mechanics does not exist in quantum field theory. Therefore, a new approach to the description of the scattering processes of particles was necessary, which he developed in the following years (Haag-Ruelle scattering theorySee e.g. the review Scattering in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, .). During this work, he realized that the rigid relationship between fields and particles that had been postulated up to that point did not exist. The decisive factor for the particle interpretation is rather the Einstein locality principle, transferred to quantum field theory, which assigns operators to regions of spacetime. These insights found their final formulation in the Haag-Kastler axioms for the local observables of every quantum field theory. This framework uses elements of the theory of operator algebras and is therefore referred to as algebraic quantum field theory or, with a view to the physical content, as local quantum physics. This concept proved fruitful for understanding fundamental properties of any theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space. Without making assumptions about the existence of fields that are not directly observable (since they change the charge), Haag, in collaboration with Sergio Doplicher and John E. Roberts, has elucidated the possible structure of the superselection sectors of the observables in theories with short-range forcesThe only additional assumption to the Haag-Kastler axioms for the observables in this analysis was the postulate of the Haag duality, which was later established by Joseph J. Bisognano and Eyvind H. Wichmann in the framework of quantum field theory; the discussion of infinite statistics was also dispensed with.. Sectors can always compose, each sector satisfies either the para-Bose or para-Fermi statistics and for each sector there is a conjugate sector. These insights correspond to the additivity of charges in the particle interpretation, to the Bose-Fermi alternative for particle statistics and to the existence of antiparticles. In a special case (simple sectors) a global gauge group and charge-carrying fields could be reconstructed from the observables, the charged fields generate all sectors from the vacuum state. These results were later generalized for arbitrary sectors by Doplicher and Roberts (Doplicher-Roberts duality theorem). The application of these methods to theories in low- dimensional spaces also led to an understanding of the occurrence of braid group statistics and quantum groups. In quantum statistical mechanics, Haag, together with Nicolaas M. Hugenholtz and Marius Winnink, succeeded in generalizing the Gibbs-von Neumann characterization of thermal equilibrium states using the KMS condition (from Kubo, Martin, and Schwinger) in such a way that it also extends to infinite systems in the thermodynamic limit. It turned out that this condition also plays a prominent role in the theory of von Neumann algebras (Tomita‚ÄìTakesaki theory). This theory has proven to be a central element in structural analysis and recently also in the construction of concrete quantum field theoretical modelsAn overview of the construction of a large number of models using these methods can be found in: Gandalf Lechner, Algebraic Constructive Quantum Field Theory: Integrable Models and Deformation Techniques, pp. 397‚Äì449 in: Advances in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, Springer, 2015.. Together with Daniel Kastler and Ewa Trych-Pohlmeyer, Haag also succeeded in deriving the KMS condition from the stability properties of thermal equilibrium states. Together with Huzihiro Araki, Daniel Kastler and Masamichi Takesaki, he also developed a theory of chemical potential in this context. The framework created by Haag and Kastler for studying quantum field theories in Minkowski space can be transferred to theories in curved spacetime. By working with Klaus Fredenhagen, Heide Narnhofer and Ulrich Stein, Haag made important contributions to the understanding of the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation. Haag had a certain mistrust towards what he saw as speculative developments in theoretical physics, but occasionally dealt with such questions. The best known is the Haag‚Äì≈Åopusza≈Ñski‚ÄìSohnius theorem, which classifies the possible supersymmetries of the S-matrix that are not covered by the Coleman‚ÄìMandula theoremThe theorem of Sidney Coleman and Jeffrey Mandula excludes a nontrivial coupling of bosonic inner symmetry groups with geometric symmetries (Poincar√© group). The supersymmetry, on the other hand, allows such a coupling..  Honors and awards  In 1970 he received the Max Planck Medal and in 1997 the Henri Poincar√© Prize. He was a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (since 1980) and the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences. He was a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.  Publications  * On quantum field theories, Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser Kong.

Luodong is the smallest township in the county. Naming Its name and former name () derive from the Kavalan word rutung, meaning \\"monkey\\", referring to a large population of monkeys there half century ago. History=Qing Dynasty In 1804, Pingpu tribe chiefs Pan Xian Wen and Maoge from Changhua led a group of people to settle in the Luodong area, where they established Alishih and Ashushih communities and developed agriculture on a large scale. In 1812, Qing Dynasty officer Fan Bang Gan was assigned to Luodong. Two years later, Han settlers entered the region to begin clearing and developing the area. The Pingpu tribe and Han settlers fought over land ownership but eventually they ended up working together to develop Luodong. Years later, Luodong became a developed region with a combination of aboriginal and Han cultures. Japanese Empire Under Japanese rule, Luodong was developed into the base for industries established by the Taiping Mountain logging business. In 1916, the Japanese government established the Giran Branch Office of the Forest Administration Bureau in charge of logging, transportation and storage of Taiping Mountain area timber with a log pond set up in today's Yuanshan Township. The branch office was then later on moved to Luodong due to the change in the lumber transportation from waterway to railway. Finally in 1924, upon the completion of railway connecting Luodong and Tuchang (ÂúüÂ†¥ in Datong), the branch office was officially moved to . From that moment onward, Luodong became a commercial center. From 1920-1945, Lutung was administrated as of Taihoku Prefecture. Geography Luodong is located on Lanyang Plain. It covers an area of and as of 2014 had a population of 72,533 people. It has a large, landscaped sports park. Administrative divisions Luodong Township consists of 25 villages and 524 neighborhoods.

Geography It is long and wide, with a total area of . Its highest point is the summit of Mount Tukosmera in the south of the island. Siwi Lake was located in the east, northeast of the peak, close to the coast until mid-April 2000 when following unusually heavy rain, the lake burst down the valley into Sulphur Bay, destroying the village with no loss of life. Mount Yasur is an accessible active volcano which is located on the southeast coast. History Cannibal Feast on Tanna by Charles E. Gordon Frazer c. 1885-9 Tanna was first settled about 400 BC by Melanesians from the surrounding islands. The glowing light of Mount Yasur attracted James Cook, the first European to visit the island, in August 1774, where he landed in an inlet on the southeastern tip of the island that he named Port Resolution after his ship HMS Resolution. He gave the island the name of Tanna, probably from the local name for earth, tana in the Kwamera language.Biography of John Gibson Paton at Christian Biography Resources In the 19th century, traders and missionaries (chiefly Presbyterian) arrived. The Tannese stuck to their traditions more strongly than other islands; there remain fewer Christians in comparison with the other islands of Vanuatu. Whaling vessels were some of the first regular visitors to the island in the nineteenth century. The first on record was the Rose in February 1804. The last known such visit was by the Sea Ranger in September 1871.Langdon, Robert (1984) Where the whalers went: An index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century, Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.191. Tanna was not a principal site of World War II, but about 1,000 people from Tanna were recruited to work on the American military base on √âfat√©. Exposure to First World living standards may have led to the development of cargo cults. Many have died out, but the John Frum cult remains strong on Tanna today, especially at Sulphur Bay in the south east and Green Point in the South West of the Island. The documentary Waiting for John (2015) by Jessica Sherry provides a history and overview of the current scene regarding these beliefs.Waiting for John Documentary. Retrieved 30 May 2017. A secessionist movement began in the 1970s, and the Nation of Tanna was proclaimed on 24 March 1974. While the British were more open to allowing its holdings in Vanuatu to achieve independence, it was opposed by the French colonists and finally suppressed by the Anglo-French Condominium authorities on 29 June 1974. Flag of the Island of Tanna In 1980, there was another attempt to secede, declaring the Tafea Nation on 1 January 1980, its name coming from the initials of the five islands that were to be part of the nation (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango and Aneityum). British forces intervened on 26 May 1980, allowing the island to become part of the newly independent nation of Vanuatu on 30 July 1980. Tanna and nearby Erromango were devastated by cyclone Pam in mid-March 2015, with reports of an unknown number of deaths, complete destruction of the island‚Äôs infrastructure and permanent shelters, and no drinking water. Following this, an El Ni√±o-spurred drought further impacted on the people of Tanna. Culture and economy Tanna's location. Population It is the most populous island in Tafea Province, with a population of about 29,000,2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu and one of the most populous islands in the country. Isangel, the provincial administrative capital, is on the west coast near the island's largest town of L√©nakel. Tanna is populated almost entirely by Melanesians and they follow a more traditional lifestyle than many other islands. Some of the higher altitude villages are known as kastom villages, where modern inventions are restricted, the inhabitants wear penis sheaths () and grass skirts, and the children do not go to public schools. According to anthropologist Jo√´l Bonnemaison, author of \\"The Tree and the Canoe: history and ethnography of Tanna,\\" their resistance to change is due to their traditional worldview and how they \\"perceive, internalise, and account for the dual concepts of space and time.\\" Lissant Bolton.

The first John appeared at night as a spirit at a place called Green Point and told the people to return to their traditional way of life, or kastom. From that time kastom on Tanna has been seen as an alternative to the modernity encouraged by many missionary denominations. Yaohnanen is the centre of the Prince Philip Movement, which reveres Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the prince consort of the United Kingdom. The cult is examined by British writer Matthew Baylis in his 2013 book Man Belong Mrs Queen: Adventures with the Philip Worshippers. Christian missionary John Gibson Paton served in Tanna in the mid 1800s. Cannibalism was practiced before Christianity swept the island. In the biography of Paton the horror of the pagan practice of abusing and murdering disobedient wives is detailed. Language There are three main languages spoken on Tanna: the southern language of Kwamera, the South- Western language adjacent to the slopes of Tokosmera, of which there are many dialects spoken by very small groupings, constitute two of the languages. The remaining majority of Tanna islanders speak four dialects, being North Tanna in the northwest, L√©nakel in the west-central area near L√©nakel, and the middle bush dialect in the central plateau of the island, which is very close to Lenakel Whitesands in the northeast near Whitesands. These are generally grouped into the Tanna languages family, which is a subgroup of the South Vanuatu languages, an Austronesian language branch. According to Ethnologue, each is spoken by a few thousand, and L√©nakel, with 8,000 speakers, is one of the dialects of Vanuatu with the most speakers. Many people on Tanna also speak Bislama, which is one of Vanuatu's three official languages (together with English and French). Economy The island is one of the most fertile in Vanuatu and produces kava, coffee, coconut, copra, and other fruits and vegetables. Recently, tourism has become more important, as tourists are attracted to the volcano and traditional culture. To help preserve the integrity of culture as a tourism asset, only local people are permitted to act as guides. There are various types of accommodation on the island.

Part of their itinerary included an off-screen meeting with the prince., The Independent, 6 October 2007 In An Idiot Abroad, Series 2, Episode 1, Karl Pilkington visited Tanna and discussed the Prince Philip Movement and met those who visited Windsor Castle. In 2009 the Travel Channel aired Meet the Natives: USA, which brought five men from another group from Tanna to the United States.Meet the Natives: USA , Travel Channel, Accessed 24 December 2009 Their tribe reveres Tom Navy, an American World War II sailor who generations ago had taught the inhabitants to live in peace. The Tanna ambassadors were taken across, visiting five states, and eventually meeting former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and verifying with him that the spirit of peace taught by Tom Navy lives on in then US President, Barack Obama. While visiting with a family on Fort Stewart, US Army Major- General Tony Cucolo conferred a World War II Victory Medal and an Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Medal upon the chief in representation of the contribution the people of Tanna in World War II. Tanna, a film depicting the true story of a couple who decided to marry for love, rather than obey their parents' wishes, is set on the island, and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards.

Following a protracted development, the SW-4 entered service in 2002, the primary operator of the type has been the Polish Armed Forces. The SW-4 was further developed by PZL- ≈öwidnik and corporate parent AgustaWestland into an optionally piloted vehicle, the SW-4 Solo. From 2016 onwards, the type has been marketed to civil operators as the AW009, while the SW-4 designation shall be continue to be used for the military market. Development=Origins The design of the SW-4 helicopter originates from the 1960s, during which period it was decided against proceeding to production with the SW-4 due to demand for military helicopters from various nations within the Warsaw Pact.Wastnage, Justin. \\"PZL SW-4 prepares for certification within weeks\\" Flight International, 21 May 2002. Around 1981, development work at PZL-Swidnik was started on a new four/five place light utility helicopter. The original design for the SW-4 called for it to be powered by a 300 kW (400 shp) PZL Rzeszow GTD350 turboshaft engine, as featured upon the prototype mockup. According to PZL- Swidnik, the early SW-4 could reach the rated top speed of about 240 km/h (130 kn) and a max range with auxiliary fuel tank about 900 km (485 nmi). Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent European restructuring, predominantly those countries that had formerly been members of the Warsaw Pact, the emerging political climate had allowed PZL-Swidnik to redesign the SW-4 to make use of a new foreign-built powerplant, the Allison (now Rolls- Royce) Model 250 turboshaft engine, which was 13% more powerful while consuming 30% less fuel than the originally-intended GTD350 powerplant. Other changes were made to the design, which ultimately bore little resemblance to its earlier form. In 1995, the SW-4 project was formally re-launched and, in addition to the switch of power plant, the rotorcraft's design was substantially modified. Design alternations include the adoption of epoxy resin-based composite materials for the fuselage structure, further streamlining of the fuselage, and a revised tail and tail boom made primarily of aluminium. SW-4 idling prior to takeoff, 2006 In December 1994, the project had proceeded to ground testing of a non-flying prototype. Subsequently, a pair of flight-capable prototypes were assembled to support the development program. The first prototype was planned to perform an initial flight in January 1995, however this was delayed due to vibration issues during engine runs. On 26 October 1996, the SW-4 was reported as having performing its first flight; an official first flight was conducted on 29 October 1996.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\".\\" Flight International, 17 November 1996.\\"Current Helicopter Programs.\\" Flying, February 2000. Vol. 127, No. 2. p. 46. By May 2002, the two prototypes had accumulated a total of 640 flight hours. PZL-Swidnik targeted US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FAR Part 27 certification for the SW-4. it was believed that the program should be capable of producing production models by 1999. A decision to redesign the main rotor head resulted in considerable delays to the flight testing program; during this time, other changes were made to the rotorcraft, included the horizontal stabilizer being extended and improvements of the hydraulic systems. In 2002, the first production model SW-4, which was equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine, was approaching receipt of certification from the Polish civil aviation authority. Certification for use in other markets is to be made upon customer request, targeting a $700,000 price at the time. On 1 October 2002, serial production of the SW-4 formally began.Jaxa-Malakowski, Ryszard. \\"SW-4 five-seater goes into series production.\\" Flight International, 1 October 2002.

The parish also includes the hamlets of Hall End, Keeley Green and Wootton Green.  History  Wootton has had a long association with brick-making, but is now mainly a dormitory community for Bedford and Milton Keynes. In the 18th century church bells were made here for several churches in Bedfordshire and adjoining counties. There has been a great deal of residential development over the last 30 years but some attractive old timber-framed houses still survive. The Church of St Mary the Virgin in the village is mainly 14th century but contains two fine monuments in the chancel to members of the Monoux family who died in 1685 and 1707. To the west of the church is Wootton House, an impressive late 17th- century house with a contemporary, red brick stable block. Demography The Domesday Book of 1086, listed Wootton as having 26 residents (20 villagers and six slaves) across ten hides. By 1901, the population had risen to 1,252. The population remained fairly steady throughout the first half of the 20th century. But by 1971, the population had climbed to 2,386, a 35.61% (1010 residents) increase within ten years. By 2001 that figure was 4,230. According to the 2011 Census, the area covered by Wootton civil parish had 4,156 residents who lived in 1,654 households. The median age of the population is 44.

The Tonian is preceded by the Stenian Period of the Mesoproterozoic era and followed by the Cryogenian. Rifting leading to the breakup of supercontinent Rodinia, which had formed in the mid- Stenian, occurred during this period, starting from 900 to 850 Mya.

When his partner Joey dies in a botched drugs operation and he uncovers police corruption at the highest level, Dempsey is under threat of assassination. With help from his colleagues, he hurriedly leaves New York for London, on the pretense of an undercover international police exchange programme. Harriet \\"Harry\\" Makepeace is the daughter of Lord Winfield (Ralph Michael), who owns an English stately home. Reference is made to his having formerly been in the Army or the Secret Service. Makepeace's grandfather is mentioned as having been a Victorian collector of antiques and rare items. Makepeace‚Äôs mother is mentioned only once, by her maternal uncle Duffy and, it would seem she had died some time ago. Makepeace has made her way up through the ranks of the police force, despite sexism by her male counterparts and the physical demands of the job. Although there is initial reluctance on both sides, Makepeace and Dempsey work as partners in a specialised task force, SI 10, and they make a good team. SI 10 is under the command of Gordon Spikings, played by Ray Smith. A fourth regular role is that of Chas, played by Tony Osoba, who provides useful research and communications in the SI 10 office and occasionally has a more active role. Two double-length episodes were produced, the first being the pilot (\\"Armed and Extremely Dangerous\\"), with the second the series 3 two-part opener (\\"The Burning\\"). At the height of the series‚Äô popularity, and during season 2 particularly, the British tabloid press hounded the lead actors for off-screen stories regarding their then-budding personal relationship. Much of the show‚Äôs draw came from the good natured \\"will they or won‚Äôt they\\" interplay and a slowly evolving romance between the main protagonists, made possible by the obvious chemistry between the two lead actors. The show ended with an episode directed by Michael Brandon himself where Dempsey and Makepeace are forced to confront at least some of their feelings for one another. Main cast *Michael Brandon as Lieutenant James Dempsey NYPD *Glynis Barber as Detective Sergeant Lady Harriet \\"Harry\\" Makepeace *Ray Smith as Chief Superintendent Gordon Spikings *Tony Osoba as Detective Sergeant Charles Jarvis *Colin McFarlane as Detective Sergeant Watson *Jonathan Docker-Drysdale as Detective Sergeant Ward Production=Filming locations In episode 9 of series 1, \\"Cry God for Harry\\", Chilham Castle in Kent becomes Winfield Hall, the grand English estate of Lord Winfield (Ralph Michael), and Chilham Square also makes a brief appearance as Dempsey and Makepeace approach the grand gates to the estate. Episode 1 of series 2, \\"Silver Dollar\\", used London Weekend Television's own studio building and reception area as the location for the fictional company Consolidated Westmore. As with many films and television programmes of the era, extensive filming was conducted at the disused remains of the East Greenwich Gas Works (the present-day site of The O2). A shot of Chief Superintendent Gordon Spikings (Ray Smith) in front of Cutty Sark was incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence. Episodes Dempsey and Makepeace ran for three series between 11 January 1985 and 1 November 1986. A total of 30 episodes were produced. Broadcast The show was originally broadcast on ITV between 11 January 1985 and 1 November 1986. From July 2009, the series was repeated on ITV3 in the UK, and again on ITV4 from July 2020. Forces TV will show from 1st September 2020 International broadcast It was sold to many countries in Europe, including Eastern Bloc Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary, where it became an especially popular weekend-night TV-movie series with the usual high quality dubbing (original Hungarian revoiced episodes, kept inaccessibly in the archives of Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥, are much sought after as very hard to find \\"collectables\\" by that country's film fans). The programme was broadcast elsewhere worldwide, such as on Pakistan Television during 1985‚Äì86. The series was also syndicated to the U.S. airwaves in the autumn of 1985, usually broadcast on Saturday afternoons or early evenings. However, only the first 20 hours of the series were run in the U.S. (straight through in 19 weeks); by mid-January 1986, it was discontinued, with the 10 episodes of series 3 never being aired. To encourage interest, the show was marketed in the U.S. as being similar to a re-make of The Avengers, but, while well advertised, it never grew a substantial following. Reception=Ratings The show was also critically acclaimed. All three series attained great popularity in the UK, achieving good ratings with 20 million viewers in the UK. Home media * In the UK, all three series of Dempsey and Makepeace were released on DVD in 2006 from Network DVD. They include interviews and audio commentaries on selected episodes with Michael Brandon and Glynis Barber, however the episodes themselves were frequently abridged and cut to make them suitable for pre-watershed television. * In Portugal, all three series were released in 2004 by Prisvideo. There were no extras but the audio was in English with optional Portuguese subtitles, and the episodes were uncut*. (*Episode 'Judgement' has a scene removed towards the end where Judge Hackett is holding Bates hostage; however, it is believed this edit may have been made shortly after the episode was made, even before its original broadcast). * Starting with December 2004, DVDs and VCDs with all the episodes of the series were gradually added in Poland to a TV-guide magazine TV Okey!. They soon re-appeared in another collection series and finally, on 8 December 2008 a box with Season 1 episodes was released. * In mid 2000s a DVD was released in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia with Slovak dubbing. In other media In the UK, Dempsey and Makepeace merchandise such as jigsaw puzzles, children‚Äôs annuals and replica toy cars were produced.

Zinc finger inhibitors, or zinc ejectors, are substances or compounds that interact adversely with zinc fingers and cause them to release their zinc from its binding site, disrupting the conformation of the polypeptide chain and rendering the zinc fingers ineffective, thereby preventing them from performing their associated cellular functions. This is typically accomplished through chelation of the zinc binding site. As zinc fingers are known to be involved in m-RNA regulation, reverse transcription, protection of synthesized viral DNA, transcription inhibition, and initial integration processes, prevention of zinc finger function can have drastic effects on the function of the cell or virus. Zinc finger inhibitors are typically used to combat HIV. HIV treatments usually rely on targeting reverse transcriptases and proteases. However, these methods are proving to be ineffective due to the development of resistant strains of the virus or due to the stoppage of the treatment. This method of using zinc finger inhibitors to target and destabilize zinc fingers represents a new method of fighting HIV. Other viruses such as SARS, polio, Ebola, measles, human coxsackie, Dengue, rabies, human hepatitis, human parainfluenza and human respiratory syncytical have similar zinc finger motifs and could potentially benefit from zinc finger inhibitor technology. Zinc ejectors were patented in 2008 and some have entered Phase I/II trials as a HIV drug. Zinc Finger Inhibitor Target: Nucleocapsid Protein The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein 7 (NCp7) is the protein targeted by zinc ejectors. NCp7 is initially formed as part of the gag polypeptide and follows a gag-knuckle zinc finger conformation. In its lifetime, NCp7 facilitates the unwinding of tRNA, acts as a primer for reverse transcription, chaperones nucleic acids within the capsid of HIV-1, helps integrate the viral RNA into budding virions, and is intimately involved in the replication of HIV-1 in both the early phase and late phase. These processes play critical roles in the replication of HIV-1 thus making NCp7 a prime target for drugs seeking to contravene the replication process. This image shows the zinc finger structure of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein. The cysteines of the CCHC motif are given in yellow; the histidine in blue. The dashed lines represent the coordinate bonds between the Zn ion and the respective residues. NCp7 is a 55-amino acid protein that is highly basic and consists of two gag-knuckle motifs. These motifs contain two peptide units of Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys (CCHC), where the X represents a substituted amino acid, that make up the zinc (II) ion binding sites. The binding of zinc (II) in the CCHC binding site is necessary for the domain to be functional and for the stabilization of the conformation of the structure, allowing the NCp7 to carry out the processes required for HIV replication. Since the CCHC binding site is mutation resistant and involved in the replication of HIV-1, it makes a prime candidate for the prevention of HIV through zinc ejectors. By inhibiting the function of NCp7, the viral replication is affected and a non-functional virus that is unable to infect its host is produced. Zinc Ejector Compounds=Azodicarbonamide Azodicarbonamide (ADA) was the first zinc ejector to go into clinical trial for treatment of HIV. ADA inhibits HIV by electrophilically attacking the sulfur atoms of the zinc coordinated cysteine. This electrophilic interaction destabilizes the zinc binding site making it easier for the zinc ion to be withdrawn due to the new arrangement of bonds. The binding site then performs a disulfide exchange, forming new intermolecular disulfide bonds, and rearrangement occurs placing the zinc finger in a conformation that inhibits its function. C-nitroso 3-nitrosobenzamide (NOBA) and 6-nitroso-1,2-benzopyrone (NOBP) were the first compounds to demonstrate an ability to inhibit infection of HIV by ejecting zinc from NCp7. In the same manner as ADA, the compounds interact with an 18-residue polypeptide on the N terminal zinc knuckle region of the HIV nucleocapsid protein which causes ejection of the zinc from the region by covalently modifying the cysteine residues. Studies suggest that NOBA and NOBP were able to inhibit HIV-1 infection by inhibiting reverse transcription without an apparent impairment of reverse transcriptase. This reiterates the role of NCp7 in reverse transcription. 2,2‚Äô-di-thiobisbenzamide (DIBA) DIBAs act similarly to ADA, NOBA and NOBP. They react with the cysteine residues on the zinc finger of the NCp7 and cause a covalent conformation change which ejects the zinc from the zinc finger domain. Though DIBAs initially seemed to be promising antiviral candidates, there were clinical issues with their stability. DIBAs tend to cyclize into benzisothiazolones which do not have the same potency when used to combat retroviruses as the original compound. Additionally, glutathione can reduce the disulfide bonds in DIBA thereby restricting its function in vitro. Mercaptobenzamides  Mercaptobenzamide prodrugs transfer acyl group to 36th cysteine residue of NCp7 and the acyl group then migrates to neighboring lysine residue that triggers the ejection of Zn. The mercaptobenzamide and its corresponding prodrug yielded additivity to synergy when combined with known HIV drugs. Moreover they showed no cytotoxicity. Pyridinioalkanoyl thiolesters (PATES) N-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]sulfacetamide bromide (referred to as compound 45) is a pyridinioalkanoyl thiolester that can function as a zinc ejector. Once activated with silver, compound 45 uses its pyridinioalkanoyl groups to covalently modify NCp7, specifically altering cysteines 36 and 49 on the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. It ejects the zinc from the zinc binding sites in a two steps. The zinc in the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger is released first, followed by the ejection of zinc from the amino-terminal zinc finger. Bis-Thiadizolbenzene-1,2-Diamine Bis- Thiadizolbenzene-1,2-diamine (NV038) is one of the newer zinc ejectors. NV038 is found to effect the function of the zinc finger after the virus has entered the cell but before reverse transcription is completed. NV038, like other zinc ejector compounds, chelates zinc to remove it from its binding site. However, it is thought to act through a different mechanism than many of the other zinc ejectors due to its structural features. Its structure would not readily allow thiol-disulfide interchange or acyl transfer to cysteine. Instead, NV038 is believed to react with the zinc using its two carbonyl oxygens found in the esters. Safety Concerns There was concern over whether these zinc ejectors were safe to use due to the uncertainty as to whether the zinc ejectors had sufficient selectivity to target only the CCHC binding sites of the zinc fingers in NCp7. Zinc finger domains are not unique to HIV but rather are ubiquitous in cell biology, and play important roles in many processes such as cellular replication, protein-protein interactions, and DNA replication. If these zinc ejectors unintentionally bind to the wrong zinc finger domains they have the potential to adversely affect other cellular functions that could be essential for proper bodily functions. Experimentation and modeling of the selectivity of DIBA-1, ADA, and other zinc ejectors found that this safety concern was essentially unfounded. All zinc ejectors were found to effectively combat the replication of HIV at concentrations that did not exhibit cytotoxic effects denoting that they specifically targeted NCp7 and did not target other zinc fingers. It is thought that factors such as ligand binding affinity, ligand reactive proximity, and the general saddleshape necessary for the compound to fit into the binding pocket all play a role in the selectivity shown by zinc ejectors.

It is part of Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council and had a population of 677 people in the 2001 Census. The village was for decades effectively split in two by the A8 main road, which runs from Belfast to Larne. This situation was alleviated in 2015, with the opening of a bypass to the northwest of the village. A stream called the Ballynure Water runs through it and the houses are a mixture of old fashioned buildings and new estates. Christ Church, Church of Ireland is one of the old buildings of note in Ballynure. Transport * Ballynure was formerly served by the Ballymena and Larne Railway, a narrow gauge railway. Ballynure railway station opened on 24 August 1878, but finally closed on 1 October 1930. Sport Ballynure Old Boys F.C. plays association football in the Ballymena & Provincial League.  2002 Census  Ballynure is classified as a massive village or hamlet by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with a population between 500 and 10,000 people). On Census day (29 April 2002) there were 677 people living in Ballynure. Of these: * 22.3% were aged under 16 and 15.8% were aged 60 and over * 48.2% of the population were male and 51.9% were female * 0.1% were from a Catholic background and 99.9% were from a Protestant background * 0.4% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were unemployed. Places of interest The Ballynure Elementary School for Primary Education (often known simply as Ballynure Primary School) is only school in the village and surrounding areas until Ballyclare. It is also one of six schools in Northern Ireland classed as \\"Elementary Schools\\". The School was founded in 1930. The Ballynure Cemetery is the oldest cemetery in all Newtownabbey and second oldest in all Antrim. Additional information Jonathan Swift, the writer of Gulliver's Travels, was responsible for the Ballynure parish of the Church of Ireland, during his time as prebend of Kilroot. The Clements family, who lived at Clements Hill outside the village, were the ancestors of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. Twain, who was author of works including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, was described by William Faulkner as 'the father of American literature.' His grandfather Samuel Clemens emigrated to America and Twain was born in Florida, Missouri, in November 1835. One of his ancestors, Henry Clements, was Mayor of Carrickfergus in 1696 and another is said to have fought for William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne six years earlier. In 2007 Ballynure started a fair, which is now known as the \\"Yearly Ballynure fair\\". Along with the May Fair in Ballyclare, this fair is one of the very few yearly fairs in the U.K. where animals can be bought, although unlike the May Fair (which sells horses) the Ballynure Fair has only been known to sell cows.

Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop which may limit the ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface. Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids. The condition may also occur without any clear reason. The most commonly affected bone is the femur. Other relatively common sites include the upper arm bone, knee, shoulder, and ankle. Diagnosis is typically by medical imaging such as X-ray, CT scan, or MRI. Rarely biopsy may be used. Treatments may include medication, not walking on the affected leg, stretching, and surgery. Most of the time surgery is eventually required and may include core decompression, osteotomy, bone grafts, or joint replacement. About 15,000 cases occur per year in the United States. People 30 to 50 years old are most commonly affected. Males are more commonly affected than females. Signs and symptoms In many cases, there is pain and discomfort in a joint which increases over time. While it can affect any bone, about half of cases show multiple sites of damage. Avascular necrosis most commonly affects the ends of long bones such as the femur (the bone extending from the knee joint to the hip joint). Other common sites include the humerus (the bone of the upper arm), knees, shoulders, ankles and the jaw. Causes The main risk factors are bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids. Other risk factors include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and organ transplantation. Osteonecrosis is also associated with cancer, lupus, sickle cell disease, HIV infection, Gaucher's disease, and Caisson disease. The condition may also occur without any clear reason. Bisphosphonates are associated with osteonecrosis of the mandible. Prolonged, repeated exposure to high pressures (as experienced by commercial and military divers) has been linked to AVN, though the relationship is not well understood. Pathophysiology The hematopoietic cells are most sensitive to low oxygen and are the first to die after reduction or removal of the blood supply, usually within 12 hours. Experimental evidence suggests that bone cells (osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts etc.) die within 12‚Äì48 hours, and that bone marrow fat cells die within 5 days. Upon reperfusion, repair of bone occurs in 2 phases. First, there is angiogenesis and movement of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells from adjacent living bone tissue grow into the dead marrow spaces, as well as entry of macrophages that degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, there is cellular differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, the remaining inorganic mineral volume forms a framework for establishment of new, fully functional bone tissue. Diagnosis Front X-ray of right knee of an adolescent (epiphyseal plates are open): arrows point to avascular necrosis and developing osteochondritis dissecans in the outer medial condyle of femur In the early stages, bone scintigraphy and MRI are the preferred diagnostic tools. X-ray images of avascular necrosis in the early stages usually appear normal. In later stages it appears relatively more radio-opaque due to the nearby living bone becoming resorbed secondary to reactive hyperemia. The necrotic bone itself does not show increased radiographic opacity, as dead bone cannot undergo bone resorption which is carried out by living osteoclasts. Late radiographic signs also include a radiolucency area following the collapse of subchondral bone (crescent sign) and ringed regions of radiodensity resulting from saponification and calcification of marrow fat following medullary infarcts.

File:Intravertebral vacuum cleft sign.jpgThe intravertebral vacuum cleft sign (at white arrow) is a sign of avascular necrosis. Avascular necrosis of a vertebral body after a vertebral compression fracture is called K√ºmmel's disease. Types When AVN affects the scaphoid bone, it is known as Preiser disease. Another named form of AVN is K√∂hler disease, which affects the navicular bone of the foot,/ primarily in children. Treatment A variety of methods may be used to treat the most common being the total hip replacement (THR). However, THRs have a number of downsides including long recovery times and short life spans (of the hip joints). THRs are an effective means of treatment in the older population; however, in younger people they may wear out before the end of a person's life. Other techniques such as metal on metal resurfacing may not be suitable in all cases of avascular necrosis; its suitability depends on how much damage has occurred to the femoral head. Bisphosphonates which reduce the rate of bone breakdown may prevent collapse (specifically of the hip) due to AVN. Core decompression Other treatments include core decompression, where internal bone pressure is relieved by drilling a hole into the bone, and a living bone chip and an electrical device to stimulate new vascular growth are implanted; and the free vascular fibular graft (FVFG), in which a portion of the fibula, along with its blood supply, is removed and transplanted into the femoral head. A 2016 Cochrane review found no clear improvement between people who have had hip core decompression and participate in physical therapy, versus physical therapy alone. There is additionally no strong research on the effectiveness of hip core decompression for people with sickle cell disease. Progression of the disease could possibly be halted by transplanting nucleated cells from bone marrow into avascular necrosis lesions after core decompression, although much further research is needed to establish this technique. Prognosis The amount of disability that results from avascular necrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself. The process of bone rebuilding takes place after an injury as well as during normal growth. Normally, bone continuously breaks down and rebuilds‚Äîold bone is resorbed and replaced with new bone. The process keeps the skeleton strong and helps it to maintain a balance of minerals. In the course of avascular necrosis, however, the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them. If left untreated, the disease progresses, the bone collapses, and the joint surface breaks down, leading to pain and arthritis. Epidemiology Avascular necrosis usually affects people between 30 and 50 years of age; about 10,000 to 20,000 people develop avascular necrosis of the head of the femur in the US each year. When it occurs in children at the femoral head, it is known as Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes syndrome. Society and culture Cases of avascular necrosis have been identified in a few high-profile athletes. It abruptly ended the career of American football running-back Bo Jackson in 1991. Doctors discovered Jackson to have lost all of the cartilage supporting his hip while he was undergoing tests following a hip-injury he had on the field during a 1991 NFL Playoff game. Avascular necrosis of the hip was also identified in a routine medical check-up on quarterback Brett Favre following his trade to the Green Bay Packers in 1991. However, Favre would go on to have a long career at the Packers. Another high-profile athlete was American road racing cyclist Floyd Landis, winner of the 2006 Tour de France, the title being subsequently stripped from his record by cycling's governing bodies after his blood samples tested positive for banned substances. During that tour, Landis was allowed cortisone shots to help manage his ailment, despite cortisone also being a banned substance in professional cycling at the time.

It turns out Yt(B) = (B2 \\\\- t)/2. It√¥ calculus, named after Kiyoshi It√¥, extends the methods of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion (see Wiener process). It has important applications in mathematical finance and stochastic differential equations. The central concept is the It√¥ stochastic integral, a stochastic generalization of the Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes integral in analysis. The integrands and the integrators are now stochastic processes: :Y_t=\\\\int_0^t H_s\\\\,dX_s, where H is a locally square-integrable process adapted to the filtration generated by X , which is a Brownian motion or, more generally, a semimartingale. The result of the integration is then another stochastic process. Concretely, the integral from 0 to any particular t is a random variable, defined as a limit of a certain sequence of random variables. The paths of Brownian motion fail to satisfy the requirements to be able to apply the standard techniques of calculus. So with the integrand a stochastic process, the It√¥ stochastic integral amounts to an integral with respect to a function which is not differentiable at any point and has infinite variation over every time interval. The main insight is that the integral can be defined as long as the integrand H is adapted, which loosely speaking means that its value at time t can only depend on information available up until this time. Roughly speaking, one chooses a sequence of partitions of the interval from 0 to t and construct Riemann sums. Every time we are computing a Riemann sum, we are using a particular instantiation of the integrator. It is crucial which point in each of the small intervals is used to compute the value of the function. The limit then is taken in probability as the mesh of the partition is going to zero. Numerous technical details have to be taken care of to show that this limit exists and is independent of the particular sequence of partitions. Typically, the left end of the interval is used. Important results of It√¥ calculus include the integration by parts formula and It√¥'s lemma, which is a change of variables formula. These differ from the formulas of standard calculus, due to quadratic variation terms. In mathematical finance, the described evaluation strategy of the integral is conceptualized as that we are first deciding what to do, then observing the change in the prices. The integrand is how much stock we hold, the integrator represents the movement of the prices, and the integral is how much money we have in total including what our stock is worth, at any given moment. The prices of stocks and other traded financial assets can be modeled by stochastic processes such as Brownian motion or, more often, geometric Brownian motion (see Black‚ÄìScholes). Then, the It√¥ stochastic integral represents the payoff of a continuous-time trading strategy consisting of holding an amount Ht of the stock at time t. In this situation, the condition that H is adapted corresponds to the necessary restriction that the trading strategy can only make use of the available information at any time. This prevents the possibility of unlimited gains through high-frequency trading: buying the stock just before each uptick in the market and selling before each downtick. Similarly, the condition that H is adapted implies that the stochastic integral will not diverge when calculated as a limit of Riemann sums . Notation The process Y defined before as : Y_t = \\\\int_0^t H\\\\,dX\\\\equiv\\\\int_0^t H_s\\\\,dX_s , is itself a stochastic process with time parameter t, which is also sometimes written as Y = H ¬∑ X . Alternatively, the integral is often written in differential form dY = H dX, which is equivalent to Y ‚àí Y0 = H ¬∑ X. As It√¥ calculus is concerned with continuous-time stochastic processes, it is assumed that an underlying filtered probability space is given :(\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},(\\\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\\\ge 0},\\\\mathbb{P}) . The œÉ-algebra Ft represents the information available up until time t, and a process X is adapted if Xt is Ft-measurable. A Brownian motion B is understood to be an Ft-Brownian motion, which is just a standard Brownian motion with the properties that Bt is Ft-measurable and that Bt+s ‚àí Bt is independent of Ft for all s,t ‚â• 0 . Integration with respect to Brownian motion The It√¥ integral can be defined in a manner similar to the Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes integral, that is as a limit in probability of Riemann sums; such a limit does not necessarily exist pathwise. Suppose that B is a Wiener process (Brownian motion) and that H is a right-continuous (c√†dl√†g), adapted and locally bounded process. If {\\\\pi_n} is a sequence of partitions of [0, t] with mesh going to zero, then the It√¥ integral of H with respect to B up to time t is a random variable :\\\\int_0^t H \\\\,d B =\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{[t_{i-1},t_i]\\\\in\\\\pi_n}H_{t_{i-1}}(B_{t_i}-B_{t_{i-1}}). It can be shown that this limit converges in probability. For some applications, such as martingale representation theorems and local times, the integral is needed for processes that are not continuous. The predictable processes form the smallest class that is closed under taking limits of sequences and contains all adapted left-continuous processes. If H is any predictable process such that ‚à´0t H2 ds < ‚àû for every t ‚â• 0 then the integral of H with respect to B can be defined, and H is said to be B-integrable. Any such process can be approximated by a sequence Hn of left-continuous, adapted and locally bounded processes, in the sense that : \\\\int_0^t (H-H_n)^2\\\\,ds\\\\to 0 in probability. Then, the It√¥ integral is :\\\\int_0^t H\\\\,dB = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_0^t H_n\\\\,dB where, again, the limit can be shown to converge in probability. The stochastic integral satisfies the It√¥ isometry :\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\int_0^t H_s \\\\, dB_s\\\\right)^2\\\\right]=\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\int_0^t H_s^2\\\\,ds\\\\right ] which holds when H is bounded or, more generally, when the integral on the right hand side is finite. It√¥ processes Ricker wavelet. Off the tide of wavelet, the motion of It√¥ process is stable. An It√¥ process is defined to be an adapted stochastic process that can be expressed as the sum of an integral with respect to Brownian motion and an integral with respect to time, :X_t=X_0+\\\\int_0^t\\\\sigma_s\\\\,dB_s + \\\\int_0^t\\\\mu_s\\\\,ds. Here, B is a Brownian motion and it is required that œÉ is a predictable B-integrable process, and Œº is predictable and (Lebesgue) integrable. That is, :\\\\int_0^t(\\\\sigma_s^2+\\\\mu_s)\\\\,ds<\\\\infty for each t. The stochastic integral can be extended to such It√¥ processes, :\\\\int_0^t H\\\\,dX =\\\\int_0^t H_s\\\\sigma_s\\\\,dB_s + \\\\int_0^t H_s\\\\mu_s\\\\,ds. This is defined for all locally bounded and predictable integrands. More generally, it is required that HœÉ be B-integrable and HŒº be Lebesgue integrable, so that :\\\\int_0^t (H^2 \\\\sigma^2 + H\\\\mu )ds < \\\\infty. Such predictable processes H are called X-integrable. An important result for the study of It√¥ processes is It√¥'s lemma. In its simplest form, for any twice continuously differentiable function f on the reals and It√¥ process X as described above, it states that f(X) is itself an It√¥ process satisfying :df(X_t)=f^\\\\prime(X_t)\\\\,dX_t + \\\\frac{1}{2}f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} (X_t) \\\\sigma_t^2 \\\\, dt. This is the stochastic calculus version of the change of variables formula and chain rule. It differs from the standard result due to the additional term involving the second derivative of f, which comes from the property that Brownian motion has non- zero quadratic variation. Semimartingales as integrators The It√¥ integral is defined with respect to a semimartingale X. These are processes which can be decomposed as X = M + A for a local martingale M and finite variation process A. Important examples of such processes include Brownian motion, which is a martingale, and L√©vy processes. For a left continuous, locally bounded and adapted process H the integral H ¬∑ X exists, and can be calculated as a limit of Riemann sums. Let œÄn be a sequence of partitions of [0, t] with mesh going to zero, :\\\\int_0^t H\\\\,dX = \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{t_{i-1},t_i\\\\in\\\\pi_n}H_{t_{i-1}}(X_{t_i}-X_{t_{i-1}}). This limit converges in probability. The stochastic integral of left-continuous processes is general enough for studying much of stochastic calculus. For example, it is sufficient for applications of It√¥'s Lemma, changes of measure via Girsanov's theorem, and for the study of stochastic differential equations. However, it is inadequate for other important topics such as martingale representation theorems and local times. The integral extends to all predictable and locally bounded integrands, in a unique way, such that the dominated convergence theorem holds. That is, if Hn ‚Üí ;H and Hn ‚â§ J for a locally bounded process J, then :\\\\int_0^t H_n dX \\\\to \\\\int_0^t H dX, in probability. The uniqueness of the extension from left-continuous to predictable integrands is a result of the monotone class lemma. In general, the stochastic integral H ¬∑ X can be defined even in cases where the predictable process H is not locally bounded. If K = 1 / (1 + H) then K and KH are bounded. Associativity of stochastic integration implies that H is X-integrable, with integral H ¬∑ X = Y, if and only if Y0 = 0 and K ¬∑ Y = (KH) ¬∑ X. The set of X-integrable processes is denoted by L(X). Properties The following properties can be found in works such as and : * The stochastic integral is a c√†dl√†g process. Furthermore, it is a semimartingale. * The discontinuities of the stochastic integral are given by the jumps of the integrator multiplied by the integrand. The jump of a c√†dl√†g process at a time t is Xt ‚àí Xt‚àí, and is often denoted by ŒîXt. With this notation, Œî(H ¬∑ X) = H ŒîX. A particular consequence of this is that integrals with respect to a continuous process are always themselves continuous. * Associativity. Let J, K be predictable processes, and K be X-integrable. Then, J is K ¬∑ X integrable if and only if JK is X integrable, in which case *: J\\\\cdot (K\\\\cdot X) = (JK)\\\\cdot X * Dominated convergence. Suppose that Hn ‚Üí H and Hn ‚â§ J, where J is an X-integrable process. then Hn ¬∑ X ‚Üí H ¬∑ X. Convergence is in probability at each time t. In fact, it converges uniformly on compacts in probability. * The stochastic integral commutes with the operation of taking quadratic covariations. If X and Y are semimartingales then any X-integrable process will also be [X, Y]-integrable, and [H ¬∑ X, Y] = H ¬∑ [X, Y]. A consequence of this is that the quadratic variation process of a stochastic integral is equal to an integral of a quadratic variation process, *:[H\\\\cdot X]=H^2\\\\cdot[X] Integration by parts As with ordinary calculus, integration by parts is an important result in stochastic calculus. The integration by parts formula for the It√¥ integral differs from the standard result due to the inclusion of a quadratic covariation term. This term comes from the fact that It√¥ calculus deals with processes with non-zero quadratic variation, which only occurs for infinite variation processes (such as Brownian motion). If X and Y are semimartingales then :X_tY_t = X_0Y_0+\\\\int_0^t X_{s-}\\\\,dY_s + \\\\int_0^t Y_{s-}\\\\,dX_s + [X,Y]_t where [X, Y] is the quadratic covariation process. The result is similar to the integration by parts theorem for the Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes integral but has an additional quadratic variation term. It√¥'s lemma It√¥'s lemma is the version of the chain rule or change of variables formula which applies to the It√¥ integral. It is one of the most powerful and frequently used theorems in stochastic calculus. For a continuous n-dimensional semimartingale X = (X1,...,Xn) and twice continuously differentiable function f from Rn to R, it states that f(X) is a semimartingale and, :df(X_t)= \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_{i}(X_t)\\\\,dX^i_t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n f_{i,j}(X_{t})\\\\,d[X^i,X^j]_t. This differs from the chain rule used in standard calculus due to the term involving the quadratic covariation [Xi,Xj ]. The formula can be generalized to non-continuous semimartingales by adding a pure jump term to ensure that the jumps of the left and right hand sides agree (see It√¥'s lemma). Martingale integrators=Local martingales An important property of the It√¥ integral is that it preserves the local martingale property. If M is a local martingale and H is a locally bounded predictable process then H ¬∑ M is also a local martingale. For integrands which are not locally bounded, there are examples where H ¬∑ M is not a local martingale. However, this can only occur when M is not continuous. If M is a continuous local martingale then a predictable process H is M-integrable if and only if :\\\\int_0^t H^2 d[M] <\\\\infty, for each t, and H ¬∑ M is always a local martingale. The most general statement for a discontinuous local martingale M is that if (H2 ¬∑ [M])1/2 is locally integrable then H ¬∑ M exists and is a local martingale. Square integrable martingales For bounded integrands, the It√¥ stochastic integral preserves the space of square integrable martingales, which is the set of c√†dl√†g martingales M such that E[Mt2] is finite for all t. For any such square integrable martingale M, the quadratic variation process [M] is integrable, and the It√¥ isometry states that :\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [(H\\\\cdot M_t)^2\\\\right ]=\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [\\\\int_0^t H^2\\\\,d[M]\\\\right ]. This equality holds more generally for any martingale M such that H2 ¬∑ [M]t is integrable. The It√¥ isometry is often used as an important step in the construction of the stochastic integral, by defining H ¬∑ M to be the unique extension of this isometry from a certain class of simple integrands to all bounded and predictable processes. p-Integrable martingales For any p > 1, and bounded predictable integrand, the stochastic integral preserves the space of p-integrable martingales. These are c√†dl√†g martingales such that E(Mtp) is finite for all t. However, this is not always true in the case where p = 1\\\\. There are examples of integrals of bounded predictable processes with respect to martingales which are not themselves martingales. The maximum process of a c√†dl√†g process M is written as M*t = sups ‚â§t Ms. For any p ‚â• 1 and bounded predictable integrand, the stochastic integral preserves the space of c√†dl√†g martingales M such that E[(M*t)p] is finite for all t. If p > 1 then this is the same as the space of p-integrable martingales, by Doob's inequalities. The Burkholder‚ÄìDavis‚ÄìGundy inequalities state that, for any given p ‚â• 1, there exist positive constants c, C that depend on p, but not M or on t such that :c\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [ [M]_t^{\\\\frac{p}{2}} \\\\right ] \\\\le \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [(M^*_t)^p \\\\right ]\\\\le C\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [ [M]_t^{\\\\frac{p}{2}} \\\\right ] for all c√†dl√†g local martingales M. These are used to show that if (M*t)p is integrable and H is a bounded predictable process then :\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [ ((H\\\\cdot M)_t^*)^p \\\\right ] \\\\le C\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [(H^2\\\\cdot[M]_t)^{\\\\frac{p}{2}} \\\\right ]<\\\\infty and, consequently, H ¬∑ M is a p-integrable martingale. More generally, this statement is true whenever (H2 ¬∑ [M])p/2 is integrable. Existence of the integral Proofs that the It√¥ integral is well defined typically proceed by first looking at very simple integrands, such as piecewise constant, left continuous and adapted processes where the integral can be written explicitly. Such simple predictable processes are linear combinations of terms of the form Ht = A1{t > T} for stopping times T and FT-measurable random variables A, for which the integral is :H\\\\cdot X_t\\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{1}_{{t>T}}A(X_t-X_T). This is extended to all simple predictable processes by the linearity of H ¬∑ X in H. For a Brownian motion B, the property that it has independent increments with zero mean and variance Var(Bt) = t can be used to prove the It√¥ isometry for simple predictable integrands, : \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [ (H\\\\cdot B_t)^2\\\\right ] = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [\\\\int_0^tH_s^2\\\\,ds\\\\right ]. By a continuous linear extension, the integral extends uniquely to all predictable integrands satisfying : \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\int_0^t H^2 ds \\\\right ] < \\\\infty, in such way that the It√¥ isometry still holds. It can then be extended to all B-integrable processes by localization. This method allows the integral to be defined with respect to any It√¥ process. For a general semimartingale X, the decomposition X = M + A into a local martingale M plus a finite variation process A can be used. Then, the integral can be shown to exist separately with respect to M and A and combined using linearity, H ¬∑ X = H ¬∑ M + H ¬∑ A, to get the integral with respect to X. The standard Lebesgue‚ÄìStieltjes integral allows integration to be defined with respect to finite variation processes, so the existence of the It√¥ integral for semimartingales will follow from any construction for local martingales. For a c√†dl√†g square integrable martingale M, a generalized form of the It√¥ isometry can be used. First, the Doob‚ÄìMeyer decomposition theorem is used to show that a decomposition M2 = N + exists, where N is a martingale and is a right-continuous, increasing and predictable process starting at zero. This uniquely defines , which is referred to as the predictable quadratic variation of M. The It√¥ isometry for square integrable martingales is then :\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [(H\\\\cdot M_t)^2\\\\right ]= \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [\\\\int_0^tH^2_s\\\\,d\\\\langle M\\\\rangle_s\\\\right], which can be proved directly for simple predictable integrands. As with the case above for Brownian motion, a continuous linear extension can be used to uniquely extend to all predictable integrands satisfying E[H2 ¬∑ t] < ‚àû. This method can be extended to all local square integrable martingales by localization. Finally, the Doob‚ÄìMeyer decomposition can be used to decompose any local martingale into the sum of a local square integrable martingale and a finite variation process, allowing the It√¥ integral to be constructed with respect to any semimartingale. Many other proofs exist which apply similar methods but which avoid the need to use the Doob‚ÄìMeyer decomposition theorem, such as the use of the quadratic variation [M] in the It√¥ isometry, the use of the Dol√©ans measure for submartingales, or the use of the Burkholder‚ÄìDavis‚ÄìGundy inequalities instead of the It√¥ isometry. The latter applies directly to local martingales without having to first deal with the square integrable martingale case. Alternative proofs exist only making use of the fact that X is c√†dl√†g, adapted, and the set {H ¬∑ Xt: H ‚â§ 1 is simple previsible} is bounded in probability for each time t, which is an alternative definition for X to be a semimartingale. A continuous linear extension can be used to construct the integral for all left-continuous and adapted integrands with right limits everywhere (caglad or L-processes). This is general enough to be able to apply techniques such as It√¥'s lemma . Also, a Khintchine inequality can be used to prove the dominated convergence theorem and extend the integral to general predictable integrands . Differentiation in It√¥ calculus The It√¥ calculus is first and foremost defined as an integral calculus as outlined above. However, there are also different notions of \\"derivative\\" with respect to Brownian motion: Malliavin derivative Malliavin calculus provides a theory of differentiation for random variables defined over Wiener space, including an integration by parts formula . Martingale representation The following result allows to express martingales as It√¥ integrals: if M is a square- integrable martingale on a time interval [0, T] with respect to the filtration generated by a Brownian motion B, then there is a unique adapted square integrable process Œ± on [0, T] such that :M_{t} = M_{0} + \\\\int_{0}^{t} \\\\alpha_{s} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} B_{s} almost surely, and for all t ‚àà [0, T] . This representation theorem can be interpreted formally as saying that Œ± is the \\"time derivative\\" of M with respect to Brownian motion B, since Œ± is precisely the process that must be integrated up to time t to obtain Mt ‚àí M0, as in deterministic calculus. It√¥ calculus for physicists In physics, usually stochastic differential equations (SDEs), such as Langevin equations, are used, rather than stochastic integrals. Here an It√¥ stochastic differential equation (SDE) is often formulated via : \\\\dot{x}_k=h_k+g_{kl} \\\\xi_l, where \\\\xi_j is Gaussian white noise with :\\\\langle\\\\xi_k(t_1)\\\\,\\\\xi_l(t_2)\\\\rangle=\\\\delta_{kl}\\\\delta(t_1-t_2) and Einstein's summation convention is used. If y=y(x_k) is a function of the xk, then It√¥'s lemma has to be used: : \\\\dot{y}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x_j}\\\\dot{x}_j+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 y}{\\\\partial x_k \\\\, \\\\partial x_l} g_{km}g_{ml}. An It√¥ SDE as above also corresponds to a Stratonovich SDE which reads : \\\\dot{x}_k = h_k + g_{kl} \\\\xi_l - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{kl}}{\\\\partial {x_m}} g_{ml}. SDEs frequently occur in physics in Stratonovich form, as limits of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise if the correlation time of the noise term approaches zero. For a recent treatment of different interpretations of stochastic differential equations see for example .  It√¥ interpretation and supersymmetric theory of SDEs  In the supersymmetric theory of SDEs, stochastic evolution is defined via stochastic evolution operator (SEO) acting on differential forms of the phase space. The It√¥-Stratonovich dilemma takes the form of the ambiguity of the operator ordering that arises on the way from the path integral to the operator representation of stochastic evolution. The It√¥ interpretation corresponds to the operator ordering convention that all the momentum operators act after all the position operators. The SEO can be made unique by supplying it with its most natural mathematical definition of the pullback induced by the noise-configuration-dependent SDE-defined diffeomorphisms and averaged over the noise configurations. This disambiguation leads to the Stratonovich interpretation of SDEs that can be turned into the It√¥ interpretation by a specific shift of the flow vector field of the SDE.

The population in 2011 was 1,265,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 12.79 km¬≤.Eurostat History The ornate facada and staircase of the parochial Church of Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa The establishment of this civil parish remotes to the early part of the 16th century, as first recorded by Pedro Vaz Pacheco. On 2 June 1509, he ordered the construction of a Chapel of Bom Jesus, to serve his descendants. By the end of that century, the chapel had its own clergy, passing into a vicarage in 1568. Gaspar Frutuoso (in Saudades da Terra), refers to the parish in these terms: \\"it makes a beautiful bay, and in the centre the locality of Porto Formoso, named for the things that exist there, it is clean and the best one in the north...\\". The parochial church's patron is Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa (Our Lady of Grace), and existed by the time that Pedro Vaz Pacheco ordered the erection of the Chapel of Bom Jesus (which included a crucifix and chanel to the Virgin) as a burial tomb for his descendants. The church was renovated throughout the centuries, becoming the simple facade of basalt rock and three interior naves. In the civil parish, in the old roadway that connected Ribeira Grande to Furnas, is an obelisk (Obelisco da Ladeira da Velha) which was erected during the Liberal Wars (1829‚Äì34) to mark a long-forgotten engagement in the conflict, known as the Battle of Ladeira da Velha. Geography A partial view of the built-up area of the village of Praia Formoso, looking over into the fishing port/beach The beach and cliffs of the Praia dos Moinhos, one of the few white-sand beaches on the island of S√£o Miguel In the area of Praia dos Moinhos, a beach within an amphitheatre-like cliff face, the popular beach and locality developed from several watermills that were built along the ravine that flows into the ocean. The ravine continues to empty into the ocean on this site, dividing the sandy beach, which is popular with tourists and local residents. Immediately near the beach is the Ladeira da Velha, where a natural mineral spring, rich in potassium, erupts from the coast with temperatures around 30 ¬∞C. A therme was constructed in a small house to provide repose for people who took therapeutic mineral treatments from these waters. Economy The region is best known for the tea factories that exist in the vicinity of one another: the F√°brica de Ch√° Porto Formoso, within Porto Formoso, and the neighbouring Gorreana tea factory in the neighbouring parish of S√£o Br√°s.Tea Producing Nations: Europe: Portugal The terrain in this parish is devoted to agriculture and as pasture- lands, but several tracts are dedicated to the cultivation of tea plants, owing to the areas micro-climate.

A total of 225 were constructed.London, U.K.: Aeroplane, Fricker, John, Crosswind, October 2006, Volume 34, Number 10, No. 402, page 120. It was used successfully used during military operations in Vietnam, the Gulf War and Afghanistan. The BLU-82 was retired in 2008 and replaced with the more powerful GBU-43/B MOAB. Overview The designation \\"BLU\\" stands for Bomb Live Unit, as opposed to \\"BDU\\" (Bomb Dummy Units) used for practice. Originally designed to create an instant clearing in the jungles of Vietnam, the BLU-82B/C-130 was test-dropped there from a CH-54 Tarhe \\"Flying crane\\" helicopter. Later it was used in Afghanistan as an anti-personnel weapon and as an intimidation weapon because of its very large blast radius (variously reported as 300 to 900 feet/100 to 300 meters) combined with a visible flash and audible sound at long distances. It is one of the largest conventional weapons ever used, outweighed only by a few earthquake bombs, thermobaric bombs, and demolition (bunker buster) bombs. Some of these include the Grand Slam and T12 earthquake bombs of late World War II, and more currently, the Russian Air Force FOAB and USAF GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, and the Massive Ordnance Penetrator. Specifications The BLU-82 uses ammonium nitrate and aluminium (cf. ammonal).Independent Online, Taliban downs US chopper, killing four, November 6, 2001 The warhead contains of low-cost GSX slurry (ammonium nitrate, aluminium powder and polystyrene). The Daisy Cutter has sometimes been incorrectly reported as a fuel-air explosive device (FAE). FAE devices consist of a flammable liquid and a dispersing mechanism, and take their oxidizers from the oxygen in the air. FAEs generally run between 500 and 2,000 pounds (225 and 900 kg). Making an FAE the size of a Daisy Cutter would be difficult because the correct uniform mixture of the flammable agent with the ambient air would be difficult to maintain if the agent were so widely dispersed. A conventional explosive is much more reliable in that regard, particularly if there is significant wind or thermal gradient. The BLU-82 produces an overpressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi) (7 MPa or 70 kg/cm¬≤) near ground zero, tapering off as distance increases. It is detonated just above ground by a fuze extender. This results in a maximum destruction at ground level without digging a crater. Guidance This system depends upon the accurate positioning of the aircraft by either a fixed ground radar or on- board navigation equipment. The ground radar controller, or aircrew navigator if applicable, is responsible for positioning the aircraft prior to final countdown and release. Primary aircrew considerations include accurate ballistic and wind computations provided by the navigator, and precision instrument flying with strict adherence to controller instructions. Due to its extremely powerful blast effects, the minimum safe altitude for releasing this weapon is above ground level (AGL). Operations The BLU-82 was originally designed to clear helicopter landing zones and artillery emplacements in Vietnam. The first use of a BLU-82 occurred on 22 March 1970, when one was dropped north of Long Tieng, Laos during Campaign 139.Conboy, Kenneth and James Morrison (1995). Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos. Paladin Press. , p. 256. During Operation Lam Son 719 in 1971 25 BLU-82 bombs were dropped on NVA and Pathet Lao forces in Laos. They were dropped by U.S. C-130 aircraft not only to clear landing zones, but also to strike against specific targets such as warehouses, vehicle parks, and enemy troop concentrations. South Vietnamese VNAF aircraft dropped BLU-82 bombs on NVA positions in desperation to support ARVN troops in the Battle of Xu√¢n L·ªôc in the last days of the Vietnam War. During the Mayaguez incident, a Lockheed MC-130 dropped one BLU-82 to assist U.S. Marine forces attempting to extract themselves from Koh Tang island. Eleven BLU-82Bs were palletized and dropped in five night missions during the 1991 Gulf War, all from Special Operations MC-130 Combat Talons.Pike, John. \\"BLU-82B.\\" Federation of American Scientists, 24 March 2004. The initial drop tested the ability of the bomb to clear or breach mine fields;Craib, J. A. \\"Occasional Paper Series 1: Survey of Mine Clearance Technology.\\" BARIC (Consultants) Ltd., September 1994. however, no reliable assessments of mine clearing effectiveness are publicly available. Later, bombs were dropped as much for their psychological effect as for their anti- personnel effects.Wolfowitz, Paul; Stufflebeem, John D. \\"September 11, 2001: Attack on America .\\" Department of Defense News Briefing, 10 December 2001. Due to the size of the conventional blast, a British SAS unit that witnessed the explosion mistakenly assumed the U.S. had used a nuclear weapon and radioed back to their headquarters exclaiming, \\"Sir, the blokes have just nuked Kuwait!\\". The U.S. Air Force dropped several BLU-82s during the campaign to destroy Taliban and al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan to attack and demoralize personnel and to destroy cave complexes.

It was one of a small class of bombs designed to attack targets invulnerable to conventional \\"soft\\" bombs, such as bunkers and viaducts. It achieved this by having an extremely thick, hardened nose section designed to penetrate deeply into hardened concrete structures and then detonate inside the target after a short time delay.  Development  The T-12 was a further development of the concept initiated with the United Kingdom's Tallboy and Grand Slam weapons developed by British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis during the Second World War: a hardened, highly aerodynamic bomb of the greatest possible weight designed to be dropped from the highest possible altitude. Penetrating deeply in the earth before exploding, the resulting shock wave was transmitted through the earth into targets. The resulting underground cavity and ground motion could also undermine structures. The bomb could also be used against hardened targets. These types of bombs can reach supersonic speeds and have tail fins designed to spin the bomb for greater accuracy. Originally designed to meet a target weight (the maximum payload for the Convair B-36 \\"Peacemaker\\" bomber), with its hardened case was slightly less than . The final T-12 weighed . This was twice the size of the United States' previous largest bomb, the M110 (T-14), the American-built version of the British Grand Slam. The T-12 was not a simple scale up of the M110, but incorporated modifications based on testing and calculations. The B-36 was redesigned so it could carry the T-12, although a converted B-29 Superfortress was used for testing.

Source The content derives from Irish mythology, but it was written in the 8th-century. Some Irish tale-lists categorise the tale as an Echtra (\\"Adventure\\"), but it contains the essential elements of an Immram, or \\"Voyage\\". It may have influenced the later story of Saint Brendan's voyage. The concept of \\"voyage\\" has been widely used across the world in that time. While this specific set comes from Ireland, it can be compared with Classical sources such as the Odyssey and the Aeneid, some Scandinavian tales as well as other Brittonic tales told on what is now the United Kingdom, particularly those preserved from Wales (Y Mabinogion) and Brittany including Tristan and Yseult. The most recent translation is by S√©amus Mac Math√∫na (1985). Synopsis Bran mac Febail (modern spelling: Bran mac Feabhail) embarks upon a quest to the Otherworld. One day while Bran is walking, he hears beautiful music, so beautiful, in fact, that it lulls him to sleep. Upon awakening, he sees a beautiful silver branch in white bloom in front of him. He returns to his royal house, and while his company is there, an Otherworld woman appears, and sings to him a poem about the land where the branch had grown. In the song, she identifies the branch to be from an apple tree in Emain, another part of Ireland. In this Otherworld, it is always summer, there is no want of food or water, no sickness or despair ever touches the perfect people, and there is no unhappiness or \\"no rough or harsh voice.\\" She tells Bran to voyage to the Land of Women across the sea, and the next day he gathers a company of nine men to do so. Each of his foster brothers were put in charge of a group of three men. After two days, he sees a man on a chariot speeding towards him. The man is Manann√°n mac Lir, and he tells Bran that he is not sailing upon the ocean, but upon a flowery plain. He also reveals to Bran that there are many men riding in chariots, but that they are invisible. He tells Bran of how he is to beget his son in Ireland, and that his son will become a great warrior. He follows by prophesying the life of the boy and how Manannan mac Lir will be a teacher and a father to him. Bran leaves Manann√°n mac Lir, and comes to the Isle of Joy. All the people upon the Isle of Joy laugh and stare at him, but will not answer his calls. When Bran sends a man ashore to see what the matter is, the man starts to laugh and gape just like the others. Bran leaves him and sails farther. He then reaches the Land of Women, but is hesitant to go ashore. However, the leader of the women throws a magical clew (ball of yarn) at him, which sticks to his hand. She then pulls the boat to shore, and each man pairs off with a woman, Bran with the leader. There are three times nine \\"couches\\" available for all of them. For what seems to be one year, although it is in actuality many more, the men feast happily in the Land of Women until Nechtan Mac Collbran feels homesickness stir within him. The leader of the women is reluctant to let them go, and warns them not to step upon the shores of Ireland and to get back the man they left on the Island of Joy. Bran and his company sail back to Ireland. The people that have gathered on the shores to meet him do not recognize his name except in their legends. Nechtan Mac Collbran, upset, jumps off the boat onto the land. Immediately, Nechtan Mac Collbran turns to ashes. Bran and his company relate the rest of their story to the Irish, and then sail across the sea, never to be seen again. Historical notes The Voyage of Bran was first written down in the late 7th century to early 8th century. The poem shares similar themes and elements with other Irish immrama, such as The Voyage of Brendan and The Voyage of Mael Duin, both written in early to mid-900. For example, Bran, Brendan and Mael Duin each encounter a holy island where the inhabitants live quiet, blissful lives. Bran is told of a tree with holy birds that all sing at the same time, which is similar to what Brendan encounters in his voyage. The stories are also similar in that at one point, one of the travellers is exorcised or left behind on an island, either by free will or as punishment for a sin. The Voyage of Bran may also be compared to the Welsh text Branwen Daughter of Ll≈∑r from the Mabinogi. The parallels are not along the lines of plot, as with The Voyage of Brendan and The Voyage of Mael Duin, but rather in the names of characters. As Patrick K. FordFord, Patrick K. (ed. and tr.). \\"Branwen Daughter of Ll≈∑r.\\" The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008. 57‚Äì59. writes, both the title character Branwen and her brother Bendigeidfran‚Äôs names include the element bran (the -fran of Bendigeidfran is a mutated form), connecting them with the Bran from The Voyage of Bran. Along with their brother Manawydan, Branwen and Bendigeidfran are the children of Ll≈∑r, the Welsh word for ‚Äòsea,‚Äô and cognate with the Irish word lir in Manannan mac Lir. Structurally, The Voyage of Bran is a combination of poetry and prose, with many short stanzas punctuated by longer, prose narration. These prose narrations are known as Narrative Envelopes. Parallels with The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in The Voyage of Bran has many parallels to The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in. * In paragraph 61, Bran and company visit the \\"Island of Joy.\\" After being sent by Bran to investigate the island, one of Bran's men will not speak to the crew, only gaping at them, just like the inhabitants of the island. The man is then abandoned and left on the island. Similarly in chapter 31, of The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in, one of M√°el D√∫in's men is sent to investigate, cannot stop laughing , loses the ability to recognize his crew, and is eventually left behind. * In paragraph 62, Bran and company reach the \\"Island of Women.\\" There, they are welcomed by many women, fed well, and one of the women uses a ball of yarn in order to magically ensnare Bran. In chapter 28 of The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in, the crew reaches an island that is home to seventeen women, who are hospitable to them. When they try to leave, one of the women throws a ball of yarn that magically clings to Diur√°n's hand. * In paragraph 65, one of Bran's men jumps from the coracle after having been magically at sea for hundreds of years. Upon touching dry soil, he is turned into ash. In chapter 11 of The Voyage of M√°el D√∫in, one of the foster brothers tries to steal a necklet and is burnt to ash by a magical cat.

Under Ramsey pricing, the price markup over marginal cost is inverse to the price elasticity of demand: the more elastic the product's demand, the smaller the markup. Frank P. Ramsey found this 1927 in the context of Optimal taxation: the more elastic the demand, the smaller the optimal tax. The rule was later applied by (1956) to natural monopolies (industries with decreasing average cost). A natural monopoly earns negative profits if it sets price equals to marginal cost, so it must set prices for some or all of the products it sells to above marginal cost if it is to be viable without government subsidies. Ramsey pricing says to mark up most the goods with the least elastic (that is, least price-sensitive) demand.  Description  In a first- best world, without the need to earn enough revenue to cover fixed costs, the optimal solution would be to set the price for each product equal to its marginal cost. If the average cost curve is declining where the demand curve crosses it however, as happens when the fixed cost is large, this would result in a price less than average cost, and the firm could not survive without subsidy. The Ramsey problem is to decide exactly how much to raise each product's price above its marginal cost so the firm's revenue equals its total cost. If there is just one product, the problem is simple: raise the price to where it equals average cost. If there are two firms, there is leeway to raise one product's price more and the other's less, so long as the firm can break even overall. The principle is applicable to pricing of goods that the government is the sole supplier of (public utilities) or regulation of natural monopolies, such as telecommunications firms, where it is efficient for only one firm to operate but the government regulates its prices so it does not earn above-market profits. In practice, government regulators are concerned with more than maximizing the sum of producer and consumer surplus. They may wish to put more weight on the surplus of politically powerful consumers, or they may wish to help the poor by putting more weight on their surplus. Moreover, many people will see Ramsey pricing as unfair, especially if they do not understand why it maximizes total surplus. In some contexts, Ramsey pricing is a form of price discrimination because the two products with different elasticities of demand are one physically identical product sold to two different groups of customers, e.g., electricity to residential customers and to commercial customers. Ramsey pricing says to charge whichever group has less elastic demand a higher price in order to maximize overall social welfare. Customers sometimes object to it on that basis, since they care about their own individual welfare, not social welfare. Customers who are charged more may consider unfair, especially they, with less elastic demand, would say they \\"need\\" the good more. In such situations regulators may further limit an operator‚Äôs ability to adopt Ramsey prices.Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation ‚ÄúTariff Design: Economics of Tariff Design ‚Äì Deviations from Marginal Cost Pricing: Ramsey Pricing‚Äù Formal presentation and solution Consider the problem of a regulator seeking to set prices \\\\left(p_1,\\\\ldots,p_N\\\\right) for a multiproduct monopolist with costs C(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_N) =C( \\\\mathbf{q}), where q_{i} is the output of good i and p_{i} is the price. Suppose that the products are sold in separate markets so demands are independent, and demand for good i is q_{i}\\\\left( p_{i}\\\\right) , with inverse demand function p_i(q). Total revenue is R\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{p,q}\\\\right) =\\\\sum_i p_i q_i (p_i). Total welfare is given by :W\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{p,q}\\\\right) =\\\\sum_i \\\\left( \\\\int\\\\limits_0^{q_i(p_i) }p_i( q) dq\\\\right) -C\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\right). The problem is to maximize W\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{p,q}\\\\right) by choice of the subject to the requirement that profit \\\\Pi = R-C equal some fixed value \\\\Pi^* . Typically, the fixed value is zero, which is to say that the regulator wants to maximize welfare subject to the constraint that the firm not lose money. The constraint can be stated generally as: :R( \\\\mathbf{p,q}) -C( \\\\mathbf{q}) \\\\geq \\\\Pi^* This problem may be solved using the Lagrange multiplier technique to yield the optimal output values, and backing out the optimal prices. The first order conditions on \\\\mathbf{q} are :\\\\begin{align} p_i - C_i \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}\\\\right) &= -\\\\lambda \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial R}{\\\\partial q_{i}} - C_{i}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\ &= -\\\\lambda \\\\left( p_i \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{1}{Elasticity_i}\\\\right) - C_i \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q}\\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\end{align} where \\\\lambda is a Lagrange multiplier, Ci(q) is the partial derivative of C(q) with respect to qi, evaluated at q, and Elasticity_i= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial q_i}{\\\\partial p_i}\\\\frac{p_i}{q_i} is the elasticity of demand for good i. Dividing by p_i and rearranging yields :\\\\frac{p_i - C_i\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\right) }{p_i}=\\\\frac{k}{Elasticity_i} where k=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda }{1+\\\\lambda}< 1\\\\. . That is, the price margin compared to marginal cost for good i is again inversely proportional to the elasticity of demand. Note that the Ramsey mark-up is smaller than the ordinary monopoly markup of the Lerner Rule which has k=1 , since \\\\lambda=1 (the fixed-profit requirement, \\\\Pi^* = R-C is non-binding). The Ramsey-price setting monopoly is in a second-best equilibrium, between ordinary monopoly and perfect competition. Ramsey condition An easier way to solve this problem in a two-output context is the Ramsey condition. According to Ramsey, as to minimize deadweight losses, one must increase prices to rigid and elastic demands in the same proportion, in relation to the prices that would be charged at the first-best solution (price equal to marginal cost).

The show's plot centred on the antics of a number of ghosts who worked for a firm called Rentaghost, which hired out the spirits for various tasks. Background The company, located in South Ealing, is run by Fred Mumford, a recently deceased loser who feels he can find work for ghosts whose lives were as unsuccessful as his. His first (and only) recruits are Timothy Claypole, a mischievous jester with a comical lack of knowledge about modern technology; and Hubert Davenport, a delicate Victorian-era gentleman who is morally shocked by the modern world. The ghosts work from an office, which they rent from Harold Meaker, who discovers the truth about them in the third episode. Over the course of several series, other characters were added: Hazel the McWitch, a Scottish witch; Nadia Popov, a Dutch ghost who suffers from hay fever and teleports away when she sneezes; and the pantomime horse Dobbin, who first appears in a one-off Christmas special called Rentasanta and is brought to life by Claypole, who is unable to cancel the spell afterwards ‚Äî thus allowing Dobbin to remain in the show for the rest of the run. Another key figure is a ghost from the Wild West called Catastrophe Kate (cf. Calamity Jane), played by Jana Shelden, who is collected from outside a magic carpet shop in the Spirit World by Fred Mumford. The two ghosts are transported back to Earth on a flying broomstick, Catastrophe Kate having turned down the alternative of a flying vacuum cleaner. It is Catastrophe Kate who later introduces Hazel the McWitch to the regulars. Adam Painting, a local entrepreneur played by Christopher Biggins, frequently appears in episodes and tries, with limited success, to involve the ghosts in his latest business enterprise. When actor Michael Darbyshire (who played the role of Davenport) died in 1979, Anthony Jackson (Mumford) declined to appear in the next series, leaving Michael Staniforth's Claypole the sole original ghost. Davenport's and Mumford's absences were explained at the start of the series by the pair having gone on an extended tour of stately-home hauntings. After Mumford's departure, the business was taken over by Harold Meaker and his wife Ethel, who suffered from the various problems the ghosts brought to their lives. The long-suffering neighbours of Rentaghost are the Perkinses, who appear from Series 4 onwards and think the Meakers are mad.  Episodes  Releases  Only the first series of Rentaghost was released on VHS and DVD, with rights issues holding up further release. However, the first two series have been made available digitally via the BBC Store. Some master copies of Rentaghost episodes and other children's shows were wiped by the BBC in 1993 on the assumption that they were no use and that examples of some other episodes were sufficient. The wiped tapes were then sold overseas to countries that still used obsolete (in the UK at least) tape formats. However, BBC Enterprises had requested copies of the first three series a couple of years earlier and indeed they were showing at the time on UK Gold - these were later recovered by the BBC Archives.

The producers had originally wanted Michael Staniforth to reprise his role as Mister Claypole, the unofficial 'lead' of the original series, but Staniforth had died two years prior. The pilot, which followed a similar plot to the first two episodes of the original Rentaghost but with some of the more pantomime-like humour of later years, was set in a derelict old office in Victoria due for destruction, where the Rentaghost team had set up their business, beginning a planned story arc for the first series in which the Rentaghost team must scare off building developers to save their office/home. A young Lisa McCune played Julia, a character who visits the agency mistakenly believing them to be living people who can exorcise her haunted apartment, and ends up working as their secretary after they help her chase her poltergeist away anyway. However the pilot did not sell, with some concerns over appropriateness of dark tone of the series aimed at young children, and plans for the series were cancelled. In September 2008, it was reported that the show could be returning to television after the rights to the programme were obtained by the UK production company RDF. However, no new show was forthcoming. Deadline reported in December 2010 that \\"Warner Bros had acquired the rights to RentaGhost and was going to develop it into a Beetlejuice-style afterlife feature comedy vehicle for Russell Brand as Fred Mumford.\\" However, in October 2011, it was reported that Ben Stiller had now been signed for the project. Night at the Museum writers Tom Lennon and Robert Ben Garant had been hired to write the script, reuniting the two writers with Stiller.

He won a bronze medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo and set a total of seven world records over the course of his career. Early life Harry Jerome was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, the son of Harry Vincent Jerome and Elsie Ellen Howard, and moved to North Vancouver, British Columbia, at age 12. His grandfather was John Howard, an American-born railway porter who represented Canada in the 1912 Summer Olympics. Harry's sister, Valerie Jerome, was also an Olympian who competed for Canada at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Athletic career Jerome competed at the university level for Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon. He was a member of the Canadian track and field team at the 1960, 1964, and 1968 Summer Olympics, winning 100 metre bronze in 1964. Jerome wore his University of Oregon sweats, rather than the contemporary practice of an official national outfit for all Olympic appearances, to warm up for the Olympic 100 metres in Tokyo. He won the gold in the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and the 1967 Pan American Games. During his career, Jerome set a total of seven world records, including tying the 100 metre record at 10.0 seconds in 1960, equalling the mark established a month earlier by Germany's Armin Hary. Later he set the world record for the 100 yard dash at 9.2 seconds, making Jerome one of the few athletes to own both the 100 yard and 100 metre world record simultaneously. Jerome was a member of the University of Oregon 4√ó100 m relay team that tied the world record of 40.0 seconds in 1962. In 1966 he again tied a world record with a 9.1 time in the 100 yard. From 1963 to 1966 he held or equaled four world records concurrently.http://www.sportshall.ca/accessible/hm_profile.php?i=19 Jerome continued to sprint successfully until the late 1960s, despite suffering an injury so severe at the Perth Commonwealth Games in 1962 that doctors initially believed he would never walk again. Teaching and post-athletic career Jerome received a bachelor's degree in physical education from the University of Oregon in 1964 and taught with the Richmond School Board (1964‚Äì65) and then with the Vancouver School Board (1965‚Äì68). In 1968, he received a master's in physical education from Oregon. After retiring from athletics in 1969, Jerome was invited by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to help create Canada's new Ministry of Sport. Jerome held a number of senior positions in the ministry but resigned over the government's cancellation of a large public-private partnership he had negotiated with Kellogg's to promote youth participation in athletics. During the 1980s, Jerome headed the Premier's Sport Award program in British Columbia. Jerome died of a brain aneurysm on December 7, 1982, at the age of 42, in North Vancouver. Honours and tributes Statue of Harry Jerome in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia In 1970, Jerome was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. The following year he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Jerome was posthumously inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2001 and was named a Person of National Historical Significance in 2010. In 1984, the Labatts International Track Classic Pre-Olympic meet was renamed the Harry Jerome International Track Classic. The meet is held annually at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby, British Columbia. The Harry Jerome Sports Complex in North Vancouver, one block from North Vancouver High School where he first went out for track in 1958, and the Harry Jerome Sports Centre, home to the Burnaby Velodrome, are named after Jerome, as are the weight room at the University of Oregon and the track and field stadium in Prince Albert. The Stanley Park sea wall in Vancouver is graced with a bronze statue of Jerome. The annual Harry Jerome Awards, the national awards dinner for Canada's black community organized by the Black Business and Professionals Association (BBPA), is named after him. Another meet, called the Harry Jerome Indoor Games was created in 2011. It is held at the Richmond Olympic Oval, once used for Speed Skating events at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, but now a multi-purpose sports facility. The meet is mainly attended by high school students representing lower mainland clubs, as well as some university student-athletes, and younger athletes. On September 30, 2019, Google celebrated Harry Jerome's 79th birthday with a Google Doodle. Works about Jerome Production began in April 2009 on a feature-length biographical documentary entitled Mighty Jerome. Directed by Charles Officer and produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in Vancouver, the film was inspired by Fil Fraser‚Äôs book on Jerome, entitled Running Uphill. NFB producer Selwyn Jacob had approached Officer ‚Äî along with four other directors ‚Äî in 2007 with idea of making a documentary about Jerome. Officer's proposal was selected by Jacob and the NFB, despite the fact that he had never directed a documentary before. The black and white film uses archival footage, interviews and dramatizations to explore Jerome's life and career. Officer recreated museum installations in Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver to interview Jerome's contemporaries and family members. Jerome's sister Valerie refused to participate in the film due to objections over his portrayal in Fraser's book. The film premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival on October 8, 2010.

The band released their first demo, Ubiquitous Absence of Remission, which he contributed some keyboards. Jaska played a vital role in the formation of the band, since he was the one who brought both Alexander Kuoppala and Janne Wirman to their line-up. Jaska also provided backing vocals on the songs \\"Warheart\\", \\"Black Widow\\", and \\"Children of Bodom\\" from his band's album, Hatebreeder. Other musical ventures He has also helped quite a few bands when they needed a competent drummer. During Sinergy's 2000 European tour, he replaced Tommi Lillman, who had injured his leg. The problem, however, was that this happened three days before the start of the tour, which meant that Raatikainen had to quickly learn how to play ten of Sinergy's songs. Despite the high degree of difficulty, he managed to perform very well, and fans of both bands enjoyed seeing both Raatikainen and Laiho on stage together with Sinergy. On the Suicide by My Side album's booklet, the band wrote a dedicatory to Raatikainen for, on to their own words, \\"saving [their] tour\\". Raatikainen has also played in Virtuocity and Evemaster albums, but since those are both studio bands, he does not have to worry greatly about Children of Bodom's tour schedule, which already has to be calculated ahead to some extent, due to Laiho's previously active participation in Sinergy. On the 2002 tribute to Chuck Schuldiner ‚Äì mastermind of one of the most notable death metal bands of all time, Death ‚Äì Raatikainen, who is a fan of the band, played a couple of cover songs with Norther. A year later, Raatikainen formed a side project with Norther's guitarist Kristian Ranta entitled Gashouse Garden, which has not yet been signed to any recording label.  Equipment and sponsorships Up to the recording of the album Hatebreeder, Raatikainen was endorsed by Sonor drums and by Sabian cymbals. He eventually lost the deal with Sonor and for some time played with different drumsets, until settling with Pearl drums in 2003. His drumsticks are custom Millennium II sticks from Pro Mark with his name engraved on them.

In the year of 2000 he was asked by the director of a popular Finnish soap opera (Siamin Tytt√∂) to play a special part on it. He played a character named Rauli for three episodes, until the character's death. He did have the chance to show some of his drumwork before that happened, though. According to Raatikainen, he had always dreamed of acting, but does not plan to take his career further. Personal life Raatikainen has two brothers; Jussi, who plays for numerous professional Finnish metal bands, as well as Julius, who plays for melodic death metal band Kauna. In early 2010, he became the father of a baby girl. Raatikainen is a quiet and reserved person who spends a lot of time by himself. Most of the time, he stays in single rooms in hotels and generally picks the beds on upper corners while travelling on tour buses. Interviews with him are rare, and despite being one of the founding members, he lets Laiho and Henkka Sepp√§l√§ do most of the talking. Although his last name is Raatikainen, he is not related to Finnish guitarist Sami Raatikainen.

Biography Fawzi was born in a village near Quwaysina (Minufiyya). His father was a graduate of Dar al'Ulum and the Shari'a Judges School. He studied law at the University of Cairo. He did his postgraduate studies at the Universities of Liverpool, Columbia, and Rome, and received a PhD in criminal law in 1926. He served in many diplomatic posts as a young man, including Egyptian Consul in the Egyptian Consulate in Kobe, Japan, in the early 1930s, beginning in 1926. In 1942 he was appointed Egyptian consul-general in Jerusalem. He became Egyptian representative to the United Nations in 1947 and ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1952. In late 1952 he became foreign minister of Egypt under its new leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Fawzi was appointed largely because of his fluency in languages, and was known to avoid involvement in politics, always remaining a diplomat. Fawzi served as foreign minister of Egypt until 1958 when the United Arab Republic, a union between Egypt and Syria was formed. Fawzi served as foreign minister of the United Arab Republic until its collapse in 1961. He remained in office until 1964. After that he remained a close advisor to Nasser on foreign affairs. Upon Nasser's death in 1970, Fawzi was appointed prime minister by his successor, Anwar Sadat, as a compromise civilian candidate. Fawzi served as prime minister until January 1972 and then served as vice-president of Egypt until his retirement in 1974. He wrote a book entitled \\"Suez War\\" about the 1956 crisis with Israel over the Suez Canal and it was published after his death in 1981.

Poets most closely associated with it are Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. The term Martianism has also been applied more widely to include fiction as well as to poetry. The word martianism is, coincidentally, an anagram of the name of one of its principal exponents, Martin Amis, who promoted the work of both Raine and Reid in the Times Literary Supplement and the New Statesman.Diedrick, page 58. Perhaps the best-known Martian poetry is Craig Raine's \\"A Martian Sends a Postcard Home\\" in which a Martian attempts to describe everyday human interactions and habits from his own point of view. Origins The term derives from Raine's poem \\"A Martian Sends a Postcard Home\\" in which the narrator, a Martian, uncomprehendingly observes human behaviour and tries to describe it to fellow Martians. For examples, the narrator calls books \\"Caxtons\\" and describes them as: :mechanical birds with many wings :perch on the hand :cause the eyes to melt :or the body to shriek without pain This drive to make the familiar strange was carried into fiction by Martin Amis. His 1981 novel Other People: A Mystery Story where the story unfolds from the point of view of a protagonist who is apparently suffering from an extreme form of amnesia which causes her to lose her memory of even basic aspects of human experience. Martian poetry became a popular element in the teaching of poetry composition to school children. Related to Surrealism, it arose in the context of the experimental poetry of the late 1960s; but also owes a debt to a variety of English traditions including metaphysical poetry, Anglo-Saxon riddles, and nonsense poetry (e.g.: Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear). Samuel Johnson's descriptions of the metaphysical poets' approach where 'the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together' could aptly describe much Martian poetry; in this context what was distinctive about Martian Poetry was its focus on visual experience.

It has sedative- hypnotic properties. It is a white crystalline powder with no odor and a slightly bitter taste. It was first synthesized in Germany in 1923. It is considered an intermediate acting barbiturate. If amobarbital is taken for extended periods of time, physical and psychological dependence can develop. Amobarbital withdrawal mimics delirium tremens and may be life-threatening. Amobarbital was once manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company in the US under the brand name Amytal in bright blue bullet shaped capsule (known as Pulvules) form containing either 50 or 100 mg of the drug. It was widely abused, known as \\"blue heavens\\" on the streets, and was discontinued by Eli Lilly in the early 1980s. Pharmacology In an in vitro study in fat thalamic slices amobarbital worked by activating GABAA receptors, which decreased input resistance, depressed burst and tonic firing, especially in ventrobasal and intralaminar neurons, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean conductance at individual chloride channels; this increased both the amplitude and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Amobarbital has been used in a study to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport in the rat heart in an attempt to preserve mitochondrial function following reperfusion. A 1988 study found that amobarbital increases benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo with less potency than secobarbital and pentobarbital (in descending order), but greater than phenobarbital and barbital (in descending order). (Secobarbital > pentobarbital > amobarbital > phenobarbital > barbital) It has an in mice of 212mg/kg s.c. Metabolism Amobarbital undergoes both hydroxylation to form 3'-hydroxyamobarbital, and N-glucosidation to form 1-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)amobarbital. Indications=Approved * Anxiety * Epilepsy * Insomnia * Wada test Unapproved/off-label When given slowly by an intravenous route, sodium amobarbital has a reputation for acting as a so-called truth serum. Under the influence, a person will divulge information that under normal circumstances they would block. This was most likely due to loss of inhibition. As such, the drug was first employed clinically by Dr. William Bleckwenn at the University of Wisconsin to circumvent inhibitions in psychiatric patients. The use of amobarbital as a truth serum has lost credibility due to the discovery that a subject can be coerced into having a \\"false memory\\" of the event. The drug may be used intravenously to interview patients with catatonic mutism, sometimes combined with caffeine to prevent sleep. It was used by the United States armed forces during World War II in an attempt to treat shell shock and return soldiers to the front-line duties. This use has since been discontinued as the powerful sedation, cognitive impairment, and dis-coordination induced by the drug greatly reduced soldiers' usefulness in the field. Amobarbital was once manufactured in the US by Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Amytal in capsule form. It was discontinued in the early 80's largely replaced by the benzodiazepine family of drugs. Amobarbital was also widely abused, known on the streets as \\"blue heavens\\" because of their blue capsule. Contraindications A vial of Amytal sodium The following drugs should be avoided when taking amobarbital: * Antiarrhythmics, such as verapamil and digoxin * Antiepileptics, such as phenobarbital or carbamazepine * Antihistamines, such as doxylamine and clemastine * Antihypertensives, such as atenolol and propranolol * Ethanol * Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, alprazolam, or lorazepam * Chloramphenicol * Chlorpromazine * Cyclophosphamide * Ciclosporin * Digitoxin * Doxorubicin * Doxycycline * Methoxyflurane * Metronidazole * Narcotic analgesics, such as morphine and oxycodone * Quinine * Steroids, such as prednisone and cortisone * Theophylline * Warfarin  Interactions  Amobarbital has been known to decrease the effects of hormonal birth control, sometimes to the point of uselessness. Being chemically related to phenobarbital, it might also do the same thing to digitoxin, a cardiac glycoside. Overdose Some side effects of overdose include confusion (severe); decrease in or loss of reflexes; drowsiness (severe); fever; irritability (continuing); low body temperature; poor judgment; shortness of breath or slow or troubled breathing; slow heartbeat; slurred speech; staggering; trouble in sleeping; unusual movements of the eyes; weakness (severe). Severe overdose may result in death without intervention. Chemistry 800px Amobarbital (5-ethyl-5-isoamylbarbituric acid), like all barbiturates, is synthesized by reacting malonic acid derivatives with urea derivatives. In particular, in order to make amobarbital, Œ±-ethyl-Œ±- isoamylmalonic ester is reacted with urea (in the presence of sodium ethoxide). Society and culture It has been used to convict alleged murderers such as Andres English-Howard, who strangled his girlfriend to death but claimed innocence. He was surreptitiously administered the drug by his lawyer, and under the influence of it he revealed why he strangled her and under what circumstances. On the night of August 28, 1951, the housekeeper of actor Robert Walker found him to be in an emotional state. She called Walker's psychiatrist who arrived and administered amobarbital for sedation. Walker was allegedly drinking prior to his emotional outburst, and it is believed the combination of amobarbital and alcohol resulted in a severe reaction. As a result, he passed out and stopped breathing, and all efforts to resuscitate him failed. Walker died at 32 years old. Eli Lilly manufactured Amobarbital under the brand name Amytal, it was discontinued in the 1980s replaced largely by the benzodiazepine family of drugs. Amytal was also widely abused. Street names for Amobarbital include \\"blues\\", \\"blue angels\\", \\"blue birds\\", \\"blue devils\\", and \\"blue heavens\\" due to their blue capsule.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia, north west of Ballarat. It is one of two main towns in the Pyrenees Shire, the other being Beaufort to the south. Geography The town stands in the gently undulating basin of the Avoca River, which rises in the Pyrenees Ranges to the west. To the south, the region is bounded by low hills of the Great Dividing Range; eastwards, the basin ends in a dry forested rise; to the north the Avoca River runs slowly through the plains of the Wimmera before joining Lake Bael Bael and the lake and swamps just south of the Murray. The town and river were named after Avoca, the village and River Avoca in County Wicklow, Ireland. The region takes in an area of about , and includes the towns of Redbank, Natte Yallock, Rathscar, Bung Bong, Lamplough, Amphitheatre, Percydale, Moonambel, and Warrenmang. A few miles to the northeast, bare paddocks mark the site of Homebush, once a flourishing mining village. Avoca has many small businesses servicing the local community including 2 pubs, several cafes, a chemist, convenience store, a butcher, a supermarket, its own newspaper (Pyrenees Advocate) and a community bank. Since the 1970s, the wine industry has grown to be one of the most significant economic drivers and the sector is now the largest employer in the region and has increased tourism. History=Early settlement and the gold rush The explorer and surveyor Thomas Mitchell was the first European recorded to have travelled through the Avoca district. He found the area more temperate in climate and better watered than inland New South Wales, and he encouraged settlers to take up land in what he described as \\"Australia Felix\\". The Blood Hole massacre occurred at Middle Creek, near Glengower at the end of 1839 or early 1840 killing an unknown number of Dja Dja Wurrung people.Aldo Massola, p88, Journey to Aboriginal Victoria, Rigby, 1969 as quoted by Ian D. Clark, pp97, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 Geoffrey Blainey, pp30, A History of Victoria, Cambridge University Press, 2006 By 1850 there were several large sheep runs, and pastoral settlement was well established. Like Ballarat and many other Victorian towns, Avoca sprang into being suddenly in the 1850s with the discovery of gold. Gold was first found in Victoria in 1849 in the Pyrenees Ranges near Avoca. But it was not for another two years that the first discovery of any importance took place. In 1851 a shepherd called James Esmond found gold at Clunes, forty kilometres from present-day Avoca, setting off a gold rush to the region. In 1853 gold was found at Four Mile Flat, near Avoca, and the main lead at Avoca itself was opened up a few months later. By the beginning of December 1853, the population had increased from 100 to 2,200, and by June the following year, Avoca, with a population of 16,000, was regarded as one of Victoria's more important gold rush districts. With a Court, a police station, Post Office (opened 1 September 1854), gold wardens, churches, and schools, Avoca had established itself as an administrative centre. This was a crucial development in its survival as a town, for when the gold miners left their Avoca claims to travel to the new Dunolly rush in 1856, Avoca continued to serve as the focus of the region's commercial and administrative life. With the Lamplough rush in 1859, miners returned to the Avoca district, and in that year rich deposits were also opened up at Homebush, established on the site of the 1853 Four Mile Flat rush. This discovery brought renewed activity to the district. The value of gold mining to the economy of the area may be seen in a single statistic: from 1859 to 1870 gold worth ¬£2,500,000 was sent from Avoca to Melbourne. (Even this huge sum may represent as little as one third of the gold won as private sales were not included.) On 16 April 1889, gold mining ceased in Avoca with the closure of the Golden Stream Company mine. All that is visible today of the Golden Stream Mine is several large mullock heaps of mainly white pipeclay on the west side of the Sunraysia Highway between the railway crossing and the Avoca Cemetery. From mining to agriculture and pastoralism Avoca's economic basis was shifting rapidly from gold mining to agriculture. Many of the miners who had rushed the area in the 1850s and early 1860s settled and took up land. The big pastoral runs that had existed before the rushes were broken up for closer settlement. In addition to running sheep, several vineyards were planted from the late 1850s onward. Mining continued to be an important source of employment, but for the last decades of the nineteenth century most miners no longer worked individually or in small teams except for a small number of larger companies still working deep leads. Homebush, about ten kilometres from Avoca, was based almost entirely on company mines and flourished for several decades before these mines became uneconomical. Rural Victoria was hit particularly by the depression and drought of the 1890s. From 1895 the larger mines in the Avoca district closed and at the outbreak of World War I very few companies were still in operation. The downturn also affected agriculture in general with the last vineyard ceasing activity in 1929. Across Australia rural productivity was rising, partly through the development of agricultural machinery by implement makers such as Mackay and Shearer. Some rural areas in 1901 recorded five times the harvest yields of the 1890s, at a small fraction of the cost. In the first decade of the twentieth century Avoca's infrastructure was further developed. More and better roads were being built, the Shire Engineer attributed the problem of bad roads to heavier traffic from increased cultivation of land and more produce being brought to market. In 1911 the Sugarloaf reservoir was opened, and in the same year the district was linked to the rest of the State by telephone. The Avoca Magistrates' Court closed on 1 April 1979, not having been visited by a Magistrate since 1971. The town today= Avoca Soldiers' Memorial  The Avoca Soldiers' Memorial The Avoca Soldiers' Memorial is prominent in the park in the centre of the High Street. The war memorial often features on souvenirs of Avoca and could be said to be the symbol of the town. The memorial was built in 1921. Since early in the First World War there had been a desire in the community to honour the men from the district who had enlisted. Finally in 1920 it was decided to hold a \\"Back to Avoca\\" celebration the next year and for the memorial to be opened at this time. The memorial cost ¬£1,100. Most monuments in Victoria and New South Wales cost between ¬£100 and ¬£1000, one in five between ¬£1000 and ¬£2000, and a few more than that. (It has been estimated that ¬£100 in the 1920s was roughly equivalent to A$8000 in 1998.) Avoca, too small to be allocated a gun for a war trophy, built a monument on a scale suitable for the largest twenty per cent of communities. Having not built a band rotunda to date, it appears that the community may have used the opportunity of erecting the memorial to overcome this deficiency in the town's furnishings. The Avoca memorial, which was initially conceived as a band rotunda, is an irregular octagon with eight piers carrying a roof obscured by a parapet. A frieze above the columns contains the names of the main areas where volunteers from Avoca fought: Gallipoli, France, Palestine and Belgium. Low walls on four sides each have a soldier's helmet and pack sculptured in high relief. The entrances on the other sides are guarded by free-standing granite tablets, inscribed with the names of soldiers from the district who fought in the First World War. The tablet on the northern side of the memorial records the names of those who died. The memorial is based on a classical model but with few references to classical detailing.  Cemetery  Avoca Cemetery - Official opening of the Chinese Memorial The cemetery is located at 247 Sunraysia Highway Avoca Vic 3467. ( Coordinates ) Information on the interments, with more details and images of the headstones - here. The Avoca and District Historical Society Inc has erected a Memorial Wall in the old section of the Avoca Cemetery, to enable memorialisation of early citizens of the district buried in unmarked graves. Early in 2012 the Chinese Memorial Foundation in Melbourne sought permission to erect a memorial in the Avoca Cemetery in honour of their fellow countrymen who died in the area. This memorial was unveiled at a ceremony conducted on 23 November 2012. Chinese Garden Local business in conjunction with the Pyrenees Shire and Victorian government constructed a Chinese Garden in 2014.https://www.facebook.com/pg/AvocaChineseGarden/about/?ref=page_internal The Avoca Chinese Garden was named the Garden of Fire and Water by artist Lindy Lee. This contemporary Chinese garden represents the important contribution of Chinese people in the culture, those who came from China as immigrants and those Australians whose parents or grandparents came from China. Churches There are 5 current churches and 1 former church in Avoca.  Population  At the 2016 census, Avoca had a population of 1,193. 82.6% of people were born in Australia and 90.5% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.9% and Anglican 22.2%. Sport The town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Maryborough Castlemaine District Football League, the Avoca Bulldogs. Avoca have played in this league since 2005. They played in the Lexton Football League from 1944 until 1999. Then played with the Lexton Plains Football League until 2004 which was a merger of the Lexton Football League and the Western Plains Football League. The Avoca Football Club was formed in 1872. Avoca has a horse racing club, the Avoca Shire Turf Club, which hosts several race meetings throughout the year. Best known are the ANZAC Races on Anzac Day every year and The Avoca Cup meeting in October. Golfers play at the Avoca Golf Club on Davey Street. Avoca has had a number of Australian Football League. players over the years. The most notable being Jim Jess who played 223 games for Richmond Football Club and playing in the 1980 Premiership. Jim Jess also represented Victoria on five occasions and was an All Australian representative. Ex-Collingwood and Sydney Swans player Darren Jolly also has ties with Avoca. Avoca also hosts a wide range of other sporting events including mountain and road cycling events, running events and car rallies that profit from the natural beauty, space and support from local business and local government. Tourism Tourism is important for Avoca. The Avoca region is home to an established agricultural and winery industry thanks to its Mediterranean climate, good soil and running streams. The Tourist Information Office provides a pamphlet outlining a walking tour of the town's historic buildings which lists around 40 separate destinations. Transport The town is located at the intersection the Sunraysia Highway and the Pyrenees Highway. It was once served by a railway station, until it was closed in 1979. Freight traffic ceased in 2005. Subsequently, the railway from Ararat to Maryborough was closed for conversion to standard gauge. In 2017, there is a proposal entitled the, Murray Basin rail project designed to link Mildura to Portland with standard gauge track to carry grain and mineral sands on the now disused Avoca railway line. This upgrading will include the Maryborough to Ararat section of the line, past the site of the disused station. Water supply Today's Avoca town water supply is largely dependent upon the \\"Bung Bong Bore\\" which was originally installed in an attempt to overcome flooding of deep lead mine shafts at Caralulup. Wineries In the late twentieth century viticulture was re-established and wine and tourism are now of significant economic importance to the region. Avoca is regarded as the gateway to the Pyrenees wine region. 1963 saw the rebirth with government ministers attending the official planting ceremony. While wineries extend from near Waubra in the south to St Arnaud in the north, Avoca is considered the epicentre of the wine region. Climate The Bureau of Meteorology maintains temperature and rainfall statistics for Avoca, showing it has an mean maximum temperature of 20.3 C and an annual rainfall of 543 mm.

It is located approximately northeast of Edmonton. The hamlet was one of the many communities that spawned due to the construction of the railroad in Western Canada during the early 1900s. In 1928, the hamlet was officially founded. The name was inspired by one of the Scottish workers. The many swamps and low-lying areas in the area reminded him of his home town (Mallaig, Scotland). As the 20th century progressed, the railway has been removed, and has been replaced by the Iron Horse Trail, which is a long, recreational trail intended for all-terrain vehicles.

The performances were captured on the records Derek and Clive (Live) (1976), Derek and Clive Come Again (1977), and Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam (1978), as well as in a film documentary, Derek and Clive Get the Horn (1979). A greatest hits album containing some previously unreleased material, called Rude & Rare: The Best of Derek and Clive, was released in 2011. The characters are foul-mouthed extensions of the earlier characters Pete and Dud. Considered highly offensive by many at the time, the sketches primarily took the form of bizarre, sometime drunken streams of consciousness led by Cook, with interjections from Moore. Memorable moments from the records include Clive claiming that the worst job he ever had was retrieving lobsters from Jayne Mansfield's arsehole, Derek claiming his worst job was cleaning up Winston Churchill's bogeys (leading the pair to conclude that the Titanic was one such bogey), Clive claiming that he was sexually aroused by the sight of a deceased Pope lying in state, and a horse- racing 'commentary' featuring horses named after sexual organs or their vulgarised derivatives. Though the recordings were far too crude for a mainstream audience, Derek and Clive bootleg recordings circulated. They were mostly unscripted dialogues incorporating copious swearing ‚Äì including frequent use of the word \\"cunt\\". Characters The characters, supposedly two lavatory attendants (although in one sketch, 'Back of the Cab', they play the roles of two London taxi drivers) first surfaced in the mid-1970s. Development of the show Cook and Moore were performing on Broadway with their revue show Good Evening, a live version of their television series Not Only... But Also. The relationship between the two men had become strained as a result of Cook's worsening alcoholism. To reassure Moore, Cook hired a recording studio in New York, where the two could simply relax, drink and ad- lib. The resulting recording was padded out with live performances of old favourites, such as \\"Bo Duddley\\" and began to circulate as Derek and Clive (Live). Cook became bemused at the idea that they should not be making money from the increasing popularity of Derek and Clive, and suggested to Moore that the recording should be released officially. By this point, Moore had embarked on a successful Hollywood film career and found the tapes embarrassing, until he too realised his contemporaries were fans. Two more records were made. They were less like dialogues and more like vindictive attacks on the increasingly successful Moore by Cook, whose career had stalled somewhat in comparison. One such merciless assault was in a cancer themed diatribe when Cook was fully aware that Moore had recently lost his father to the disease. The same love- hate relationship between them is evident in the Derek and Clive Get the Horn movie. It is often mistakenly assumed that all of their releases were recorded while under the influence of alcohol. While this can be presumed of \\"Come Again\\" ‚Äì where the sounds of bottles can be heard in the background, featuring some tracks where both Cook and Moore are slurring their words ‚Äì the home video release of Derek and Clive Get the Horn shows a very sober looking Cook and Moore drinking coffee and water throughout. During the filming, a prank was played upon Cook and Moore by Richard Branson where 'police' arrive and suspiciously sniff the contents of an ash tray to the dismay of the unnerved and wary pair. Later CD releases of Come Again and Ad Nauseam featured out- takes, most were recorded during the Ad Nauseam sessions. Surreal at times, these included \\"Mother\\" ‚Äì featured on Derek and Clive Get the Horn ‚Äì where Cook pretends to visit his over-possessive and deranged mother, ending with Cook telling his mother to \\"shut your fucking face and die\\". \\"Valerie's Hymen,\\" where Moore discussed cutting out his wife's hymen with a carving knife, and \\"Lady Vera Fart Teller\\", wherein Moore elaborates on a visit to a fortune teller who could tell his future by examining his farts. Transcripts of further, unreleased, out takes are available in a book titled Come Again, edited by William Cook and feature \\"General Eisenhower\\", where Cook reflects on the perils of counting the late General's dandruff flakes; \\"Vietnam\\", where Moore received a paper cut inflicted by the Viet Cong (in one insightful remark Cook mentions a \\"friend\\" of his who fought in Vietnam but he's not sure \\"on which side\\"), and \\"A Million Pounds\\", where Cook plays an hysterical woman trying to obtain a million pounds from a sympathetic Moore. The remaining unreleased out-takes are variations on actual releases. Tracks from Derek and Clive (Live), specifically the Bo Duddley sketch, were sampled on one of the first UK house music tracks, 1988's \\"Voodoo Ray\\" by A Guy Called Gerald.

He was created by Brian Augustyn, Mark Waid and Howard Porter, though the character is primarily associated with writer Christopher Priest. He is not the Golden Age hero Captain Triumph, a fellow DC Comics property. Years after Triumph's initial appearance, Priest revealed that the character was partially based on Neal Pozner, DC's Director of Creative Services: \\"His shtick was: Triumph was always right... it was what made him so annoying to his fellow heroes. ... Neal, write this down someplace, was always right. He was. At the end of the day, Neal would be proven right. That fact, more than anything else, annoyed many staffers beyond reason\\".Priest: \\"Triumph, the hero you love to hate\\" (Wayback Machine) Publication history The character Triumph (real name: William MacIntyre, sometimes spelled William McIntyre) was portrayed as a hot- headed, arrogant and self-righteous individual who felt he was \\"denied his destiny\\" to become one of Earth's greatest heroes. Via a retcon in a three- part story running through Justice League America #92, Justice League Task Force #16 and Justice League International (vol. 2) #68, he was revealed to have been a founding member of the Justice League, serving as their leader. On his first mission with the fledgling Justice League, Triumph seemingly \\"saved the world\\", but was teleported into a dimensional limbo that also affected the timestream, resulting in no one having any memory of him and his original peers now being veterans. DC Comics fans initially disliked the character; Christopher Priest and editor Brian Augustyn decided to play to this by having the characters dislike him as well. Return from limbo One of Triumph's motivations for becoming a superhero was that his father was a low-ranking henchman for supervillains, a life that worried his mother. The young Triumph, however, misinterpreted her concern as a sign that his father was abusive and his henchman outfit to mean that his father had been a major supervillain. Another motivation was a visit by the Hourman, whom the child would grow up idolizing (and who had arrested his father).Triumph #4 (September 1995) When he first returned from the dimensional limbo to the modern era, Triumph's meeting with Justice League International quickly devolved into a violent confrontation. He ended up starring in a significant portion of the Justice League Task Force comic book (issues #0 and 16‚Äì37), alongside regulars the Ray and Gypsy; he developed a strong relationship with the Ray and saved Gypsy's life,Justice League Task Force #32 (February 1996) though he later claimed he had almost let her die out of fear of dying himself and thought that it would \\"look bad\\" if he did not save her.Justice League Task Force #37 (August 1996) Dissatisfied with the infrequency of JLTF missions, he also founded a second team of his own to target perpetrators of violent crime and completely dismantle their organizations.Triumph #1 (June 1995) His attitude ultimately resulted in his expulsion from the Justice League Task Force.Justice League Task Force #28 (October 1995) Alternatively, it could be seen that J'onn J'onzz fired Triumph because of Triumph regularly not consulting J'onn. In JLTF #30, Triumph receives a carved black candle from the demon Neron, which could give him his lost decade back in exchange for his soul. In JLTF #37, the final issue, Triumph tried to make amends with J'onn and admits to his anger at the League Christmas party ‚Äì only to blow up and storm out when he was not let back into the group. He considered lighting the candle, despondent and weary with his failed career, but Gypsy came after him and, without knowing, convinced him to leave the candle by pointing out he had saved her life. Triumph decided his life might have meaning and went back to talk to J'onn, but the Ray and Gypsy unwittingly lit his candle for a memorial. Triumph gained back his lost decade after all, but found the League was the same as it had always been and Gypsy was still alive even without his presence. Writer Christopher Priest has stated that Triumph's lost soul explains his future appearances as an evil character. Fall from grace Later during DC's 1990s resurrection of the JLA ongoing series, Triumph was destitute and a failure, resorting to selling stolen League items to supervillains to pay his rent. Because of this, he came under the influence of an evil imp from the Fifth Dimension named Lkz similar to the one possessed by Golden Age Justice Society member Johnny Thunder. Triumph mind-controlled his former Justice League Task Force teammates Gypsy and the Ray, striking at the newly reformed JLA. He believed he was using Lkz to fake a disaster that would overwhelm the current JLA so that \\"his\\" team could step in, while Lkz simply intended to destroy the world. The combined forces of the JSA and JLA were required to stop the rampaging Thunderbolt and subdue Triumph, culminating in Johnny Thunder's Thunderbolt merging with Lkz to become a new purple Thunderbolt (now summoned by the phrase \\"So Cool\\"). Throughout his attack, Triumph expressed disgruntlement with the League's alleged elitism, accusing the League of ignoring his team after the \\"headliners\\" came back, and claiming (in JLA #30) that Aquaman (who had been teammates with Gypsy in the \\"Detroit\\" League) had not cared about Gypsy and happily ignored her and \\"the old days\\" \\"once he made the dream\\". To Triumph's ultimate shock, Superman told him that he had been \\"a fine Leaguer\\" and would have been \\"welcomed any time\\" if only he had simply asked. At the end of this arc, the Spectre transformed Triumph into ice and prepared to smash him with a hammer, but was stopped by a compassionate plea by the angel Zauriel. His ice form was stored in the Justice League headquarters, marked \\"Founding Member of the J.L.A.\\" as a memorial. Grant Morrison, the writer of this story, later destroyed the headquarters, but forgot to remove Triumph; he was confirmed as deceased a few years later.Trinity #32 (January 2009) Later mentions Several years after Triumph's death, it was revealed that he had unknowingly sired a son named Jonathan. During a college protest against the construction of a nuclear reactor, the deranged teenager manifested superhuman abilities similar to those of his father. After going on a rampage and killing 19 people (including his girlfriend Christie), Jonathan was confronted by Supergirl and Raven of the Teen Titans. The two used Raven's abilities to enter Jonathan's mind, where they learned that he had been driven insane by fractured visions of Triumph's removal from history and subsequent return, as well as the changes in history caused by Superboy-Prime's actions during Infinite Crisis. Raven was ultimately able to defeat Jonathan by conjuring an image of Triumph, who persuaded his son to stop his murderous actions. Jonathan then disappeared in a blinding flash of light, and exactly what became of him after this is unknown.The Brave and the Bold (vol. 3) #17‚Äì18 (November‚ÄìDecember 2008) Triumph was briefly mentioned by Doctor Light during his battle with Kimiyo Hoshi in Blackest Night. He was mockingly used as an example of once-prominent heroes who were quickly forgotten after their deaths, a fate that Light claimed was in store for Kimiyo.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #40 (February 2010) Trinity In the 2009 series Trinity, Triumph was revealed as alive in the warped reality created by the forceful extraction of the Trinity formed by Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. There, he was a member of Justice Society InternationalTrinity #22 (October 2008) and had camaraderie with fellow hero and Trinity stand-in Tomorrow Woman. Both were informed by Hawkman that according to a scroll detailing the true timeline, they were supposed to be dead, but Triumph still fought to restore the timeline. In the end, he took an attack meant for Tomorrow Woman and saved her life at the cost of his own. He died in her arms, wondering if she could see the world that they were fighting for. She, in turn, promised to stay alive long enough to see it.Trinity #41 (March 2009) Powers and abilities Though not fully elaborated, Triumph's powers were said to be control over the electromagnetic spectrum. This power gives Triumph what he calls \\"360 degree hyper senses\\" or what could be described as a form of electromagnetic psychometry, which allowed him to perceive and to interpret the entire electromagnetic spectrum. With this ability Triumph could \\"hear\\" TV and radio signals and decode satellite transmissions.JLA #28 Triumph also displayed advanced electromagnetic energy manipulation; Superman even remarked that Triumph could kill Superman himself by cutting off the solar energy from Superman's cells to the rest of his body.JLA #31 Triumph can bend the electromagnetic energy around him for offensive purposes. For instance, he can store energy in his hands and send it through metallic wiring as a powerful electric current. He can project powerful electric blasts from his eyes capable of melting thick plastic or rubber objects, or even shredding through steel alloys like confetti. Other uses of Triumph's electromagnetic powers include creating a force field around his body granting him invulnerability as long as he is actively thinking about creating one. He has the ability to change the density of matter using his electromagnetic powers, e.g., changing water into a solid ramp. He can absorb and channel energy directed at him, such as fire. Triumph can also use his electromagnetic powers to triple the g-force inside a magnetic field while pressurizing the field to several atmospheres creating a stasis field, essentially freezing everyone inside the field. Triumph may also possess high-level physical strength, speed, and invulnerability‚Äîon at least one occasion he engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Superman and claimed: \\"I'm as strong as you, I'm as fast as you, I have powers you don't even have names for...\\" Triumph only possesses superhuman powers when he has a connection to the electromagnetic spectrum; without that source he has no powers.

She occasionally provides the band lead vocals as well as performing the piano or drums. She is also currently the band's manager. Career Gonson met Stephin Merritt in high school in the early 80's, and the pair have worked together ever since. While in high school at Concord Academy, Gonson performed in her first band, the Zinnias, in which Stephin Merritt wrote or co-wrote most of the band's material with John Gage. The band broke up when Gonson left to attend Columbia University. Gonson later returned to the Boston area to attend Harvard University, and joined the three-piece girl group Lazy Susan. She has since performed on many of Merritt's albums, including the critically acclaimed 1999 album 69 Love Songs, and frequently appears with him live as part of the usual quartet that constitutes The Magnetic Fields. Gonson has been Merritt's longtime manager since the beginning, a job involving all aspects of music management including licensing songs to films, ads and TV, creating theater shows, and all aspects of album production and touring. She also appears extensively in Strange Powers, the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara about Merritt and the Magnetic Fields. As well as her work with Stephin Merritt, Gonson also plays drums in the band Tender Trap. She has written and performed her own music with Shirley Simms, Michael Hearst, Tanya Donelly and Rick Moody.

She sang on Neil Gaiman's song \\"Bloody Sunrise\\" In 2010, she gave birth to her daughter Eve. Sexuality Stephin Merritt's openly gay identity as singer and songwriter of the Magnetic Fields has led some fans to humorously dub The Magnetic Fields' genre as \\"gay synth-pop.\\" In an interview with The Advocate, Gonson famously remarked: :'\\"When we started Magnetic Fields we purposely had one lesbian, one gay guy, one straight woman, and one straight man. The audience could identify with whomever they wanted.\\"'' In that interview, Gonson noted that she feels that Merritt's songs are predominantly about \\"Loneliness, isolation, and the need to be recognized by another person.\\" She believes that if homophobia were not so prevalent, these experiences \\"would be less rampant instead of being so associated with the gay personality.\\" Gonson believes that many LGBT youth have listened to The Magnetic Fields for \\"words of wisdom.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Interview with drummergirl.com *Interview with Unmoveable Feast * Interview with LA weekly's Vaginal Davis * My Reading Life * Saveur.com- I Love My Kitchen Because...

It is notable for its depiction of lesbian, gay, and transgender themes. The film is based on the 1891 novel and 1896 play (now lost) of the same name written by Fergus Redmond and Archibald Clavering Gunter. Plot In the film, Lillian Travers, a wealthy Northern woman about to be married, visits her aunt in Florida. While there, she stops in a curiosity shop and buys a small casket which contains a note and a vial of seeds. At her aunt's house she reads the note which explains that the seeds change men into women and vice versa. Angry with her fianc√©, Fred, Lillian decides to test the effects of the seeds. The next morning, Lillian discovers that she has transformed into a man. Lillian's transformation into Lawrence Talbot has also sometimes been read as a transformation into a butch lesbian. This reading is bolstered by the later transformation of Lillian's fianc√© into what could be an effeminate gay man. However, as Lillian and her fianc√© are shown attracted both to each other and to the same sex (albeit at different times), the film has also been considered to have the first documented appearance of bisexual characters in an American motion picture.

She was appointed to that position in June 2014. From May 2011 until June 2014, she was the State Minister for Water Resources in the Uganda Cabinet. She was appointed to that position on 27 May 2011. During the same timeframe, she concurrently served as the elected Member of Parliament (MP), representing Amuru District Women's Constituency. She resigned both those positions on 1 June 2014. Background and education Betty Bigombe was born in Amuru District, on 21 October 1952, back when it was part of Acholi District. She is one of eleven children by her father, who was a nurse. She is an ethnic Acholi. Bigombe attended Gayaza High School for her O-Level studies, graduating in 1968 and Trinity College Nabbingo for her A-Level education, graduating in 1970. She entered Makerere University, Uganda's oldest public university, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Social Science, in 1974. Later she attended the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States. She graduated with the degree of Master of Public Administration. Her studies at Harvard were sponsored by a Fellowship from the Harvard Institute for International Development. Career From 1981 until 1984, she worked as the Company Secretary of the Uganda Mining Corporation, a government parastatal company. From 1986 until 1996, she served in the Ugandan Parliament as a Member of Parliament. In 1988, she was appointed State Minister for Northern Uganda, which required her to take up residence in Gulu, the largest city in the Uganda's Northern Region. She was tasked with convincing the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) guerilla rebels to lay down their arms, following the failure of military efforts to defeat the rebels. Bigombe initiated contact with the LRA leader Joseph Kony in June 1993. In 1993, she was named Uganda's Woman of the Year for her efforts to end the violence. Despite meeting with Kony, the talks collapsed in February 1994. Soon afterward, the insurgency intensified and no significant efforts towards peace would be made for the next decade. Following a ten-year stint in the Uganda Parliament from 1986 until 1996, she failed to win the parliamentary seat for Gulu Municipality in 1996 and left government service. In 2011, fifteen years later, she bounced back by winning the parliamentary seat of Amuru District Women's Constituency, on the National Resistance Movement party ticket. In 1997, following her graduation from Harvard, she took up employment with the World Bank in Washington, DC, as a Senior Social Scientist with the Post- Conflict Unit. Later, she served as a Consultant to the Bank's Social Protection and Human Development Unit. In 1999 and 2000, Bigombe provided technical support to the Carter Center in a successful mediation effort between the governments of Uganda and Sudan. Following the February 2004 Barlonyo massacre, Bigombe took a leave of absence from the World Bank and flew to Uganda to attempt to restart the peace process. From March 2004 to 2005, Bigombe was the chief mediator in a new peace initiative with the Lord's Resistance Army, personally financing much of the logistics of bringing Ugandan government ministers and rebel leaders together. The last meeting on 20 April 2005, fell through. However, the failure of the Bigombe mediation is seen as laying the groundwork for the 2006‚Äì2007 Juba talks, which were mediated by the government of South Sudan. Those talks collapsed at the last minute when Joseph Kony refused to sign the peace agreement. In 2006, she returned to the United States and served as a Senior Fellow at the US Institute of Peace in Washington DC. Later, she was appointed a Distinguished African Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, also in Washington, DC. In 2007, she received the Peacemakers in Action Award from the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding. She was appointed the chairman of the National Information and Technology Authority in Uganda (NITAU) in 2009. In May 2011, she was appointed by President Yoweri Museveni as State Minister for Water Resources, a position that she held until June 2014, when she resigned to take up her assignment at the World Bank. Other considerations Betty Bigombe was at one time married to then Uganda's ambassador to Japan. She is the mother of two children; Pauline and Emmanuel. In addition to Acholi and English, she speaks Swahili and Japanese.

It currently is funded by several foundations and organizations. Uploads of the program regularly appear online on websites such as National Review Online and YouTube. Uncommon Knowledge was originally a weekly 30-minute TV show co- produced and presented by San Jose, California, PBS member station KTEH from 1997 to 2005. It was distributed first by American Public Television and later by PBS to public television stations throughout the United States and internationally by NPR Worldwide.  Revival  In 2006 and 2007, the Hoover Institution produced a sporadic series of for-web interviews involving Peter Robinson called Directors' Forum Video. In July 2007, these Directors' Forum Video webcasts were rebranded under the old Uncommon Knowledge moniker, starting with the newly produced episode \\"Land of Lincoln\\". Starting in 2008, each of these new webcasts premieres on National Review Online in five parts throughout the week before being published on the Hoover Institution website, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media outlets. In addition, the Hoover Institution posts upcoming episodes as a podcast titled Uncommon Knowledge, which can be downloaded from iTunes or as part of the Hoover Institution iTunes U download page. New episodes are published every other week. Viewers are permitted to suggest guests and ask questions of upcoming guests to be selected by the Uncommon Knowledge team, and/or Robinson, the interviewer- host. The viewers whose questions are selected often win the books or publications of the guests being interviewed. The show interacts with viewers on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Ricochet.  Format =Style Before its transition into a contiguous program in 2008, the show would typically invite up to three guests with opposing points of view on controversial issues and/or matters of international/public policy to debate each other on the air. Robinson moderated and posited devil's advocate‚Äìtype arguments, recited quotations to elicit the perspectives of his guests, and questioned the guests. After several segments the show concluded with Robinson asking the guests to predict what the future holds for the issue in question. He would also invite individual guests for one-on-one interviews, using much of the same interview style. In its rebirth transition from 2007-2008, and then in its reinstatement in 2008, it adopted the style of a more classic interview program, with up to three guests, but not ones designed to disagree or debate. Rather, Robinson finds like-minded or intellectually connected guests to create a more basic interview style, employing the same tactics as before to elicit the whole of a singular perspective, with guests who disagree, but not in the radically opposing sides format the program had previously favored. Primarily, however, departing from the pre-2008 style, Robinson mostly invites single guests to do one-on-one interviews and discuss the opinions and ideas of the individual guest. Setting Before the 2007-2008 transition, and the 2008 rebirth, the background for the program was that of a definitive setting, a room filled with historical and unusual objects, faded artifacts and items, antique furniture, etc., surrounding the wooden interview table. During the '07-'08 revival period, as well as the permanent revival in 2008, the background moved to the classic style interview program background with a plain black background, wooden table, chairs, and carpet, with some brief experimentation around that setup. Archives of streaming video, transcripts, and MP3 audio are available from the website for most episodes after 2000. For previous years, transcripts are available. Some videotapes of these episodes have been recovered and are being posted on YouTube under the account names \\"UKHoover\\" and \\"HooverInstitution.\\" References External links  * Category:PBS original programming Category:Hoover Institution ","title":"Uncommon Knowledge"},{"id":"1498959","text":"The , or less commonly Nitech, is a public highest-level educational institution of science and technology located in Nagoya, Japan.

Modern health and safety rules now largely prohibit the practice in industrialized areas; the current technique is to pack explosives around the base of the chimney. It is, however, popular within China's old industrial centers. The UK's Fred Dibnah, a steeplejack, became a celebrity for his technique of chimney felling. He would remove bricks from the base of the chimney and shore up the structure with wooden supports. When he had judged that enough of the chimney had been removed so as to not be able to support its own weight, he would set fire to the supports. He would then stand clear as the chimney belched its last smoke.

She has lived in the United States since 1972. Biography Born in Barnton, Edinburgh, Musgrave was educated at Moreton Hall School, a boarding independent school for girls near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire, followed by the University of Edinburgh, and in Paris as a pupil of Nadia Boulanger from 1950 to 1954. In 1958 she attended the Tanglewood Festival and studied with Aaron Copland. In 1970 she became Guest Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, a position which confirmed her increasing involvement with the musical life of the United States. She married American violist and opera conductor Peter Mark in 1971. From 1987 to 2002 she was Distinguished Professor at Queens College, City University of New York. Among Musgrave's earlier orchestral works, the Concerto for Orchestra of 1967 and the Concerto for Horn of 1971 display the composer's ongoing fascination with ‚Äòdramatic-abstract‚Äô musical ideas. More recent works continue the idea though sometimes in a more programmatic way: such as the oboe concerto Helios of 1994, in which the soloist represents the Sun God. Another frequent source of inspiration is the visual arts ‚Äì The Seasons took its initial inspiration from a visit to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, while Turbulent Landscapes (commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and premiered by them in 2003) depicts a series of paintings by J. M. W. Turner. She has written more than a dozen operas and other music theatre works, many taking a historical figure as their central character, among them Mary, Queen of Scots (1977), Harriet Tubman (Harriet, the Woman called Moses, 1984), Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (1993; premiere 1995 at the Virginia Opera) and Pontalba (2003). In 2008, her 80th birthday was marked by premieres of Points of View, Green, Cantilena, Taking Turns and other performances. In 2018, coinciding with Musgrave's 90th birthday, her compositions were performed at the Edinburgh International Festival and the BBC Proms.  Reflections on a musical career  In response to a question presented by Tom Service for the BBC about Musgrave's view of being a ‚Äòwoman composer‚Äô she replied, \\"Yes I am a woman, and I am a composer. But rarely at the same time\\". She admits that pursuing music can be a difficult career. When asked by the BBC to offer advice to young composers, she replied, \\"Don‚Äôt do it, unless you have to. And if you do, enjoy every minute of it.\\" Honours and awards * Musgrave has received the Koussevitzky Award (1974) as well as two Guggenheim Fellowships (1974/5 and 1982/3). * She holds honorary degrees from Old Dominion University (Virginia), Glasgow University, Smith College, the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. * In 2002 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's New Year Honours List. * She was awarded the Queen's Medal for Music, 2017.

Biography  Iwasawa was born in Shinshuku-mura, a town near Kiry≈´, in Gunma Prefecture. He attended elementary school there, but later moved to Tokyo to attend Musashi High School. From 1937 to 1940 Iwasawa studied as an undergraduate at Tokyo Imperial University, after which he entered graduate school at University of Tokyo and became an assistant in the Department of Mathematics. In 1945 he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree. However, this same year Iwasawa became sick with pleurisy, and was unable to return to his position at the university until April 1947. From 1949 to 1955 he worked as assistant professor at Tokyo University. In 1950, Iwasawa was invited to Cambridge, Massachusetts to give a lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians on his method to study Dedekind zeta functions using integration over ideles and duality of adeles; this method was also independently obtained by John Tate and it is sometimes called Tate's thesis or the Iwasawa‚ÄìTate theory. Iwasawa spent the next two years at Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and in Spring of 1952 was offered a job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked until 1967. From 1967 until his retirement in 1986, Iwasawa served as Professor of Mathematics at Princeton. He returned to Tokyo with his wife in 1987. Iwasawa is perhaps best known for introducing what is now called Iwasawa theory, which developed from researches on cyclotomic fields from the later parts of the 1950s. Before that he worked on Lie groups and Lie algebras, introducing the general Iwasawa decomposition. Among Iwasawa's most famous students are Robert F.

The company also produces Mounds, a similar confection that omits the almonds and is coated in dark chocolate. The two bars have the same packaging and logo design, but Almond Joy has a blue color scheme while Mounds uses red. History An Almond Joy split The Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company was founded by six Armenian immigrants including Peter Paul Halajian and Max Freedman in 1919, introducing the Mounds bar in 1920, which became a hit with the U.S. military during World War II, who by 1944 purchased 80% of their production for use in rations (5 million bars/month). The Almond Joy bar was introduced in 1946 as a replacement for the Dreams Bar, which was introduced in 1934, consisting of diced almonds and coconut covered with dark chocolate. In 1978, Peter Paul merged with the Cadbury-Schweppes company of England. In 1988, Hershey‚Äôs purchased the United States rights to their chocolate business for $300 million, which included the Mounds, Almond Joy, and York Peppermint Patties brands, in addition to Cadbury-only products such as Dairy Milk and Carmello. The name \\"Almond Joy\\" was selected by Peter Paul employee, Anna Z. Ranaudo from Naugatuck, CT. During the 1970s, Peter Paul used the jingle \\"Sometimes you feel like a nut / Sometimes you don't / Almond Joy's got nuts / Mounds don't\\", written by Leo Corday and Leon Carr and sung by Joey Levine, to advertise Almond Joy and Mounds in tandem. In a play on words, the \\"feel like a nut\\" portion of the jingle was typically played over a clip of someone acting like a \\"nut\\", i.e., doing something unconventional, such as an equestrian riding on a horse backward or a bride carrying her groom over the threshold. In the 2000s, Hershey began producing variations of the product, including a limited-edition Pi√±a Colada and Double Chocolate Almond Joy in 2004, a limited-edition White Chocolate Key Lime and Milk Chocolate Passion Fruit Almond Joy in 2005, and a limited-edition Toasted Coconut Almond Joy in 2006.

History He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1965 election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP). In the 1968 federal election, he was returned as Canada's sole Liberal-Labour MP, although he remained in the Liberal caucus. The Liberal-Labour label was a reflection of a longstanding tradition in the riding of Kenora‚ÄîRainy River aimed at deflecting votes from the New Democratic Party, rather than as a mark of political dissent. After the 1972 election, Reid was redesignated as a Liberal MP and became parliamentary secretary to the President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, and worked on issues such as improving the access of MPs to government records. In 1978, Reid joined the Cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as Minister of State for federal-provincial relations, and remained in that position until the defeat of the Liberal government in the 1979 election. Reid remained an MP until his own defeat in the 1984 election. In his post-political career, Reid became a public affairs consultant. He served as president of the Canadian Nuclear Association from 1990 until 1995. He then represented Canada on the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was also a member of the Provisional Election Commission responsible for writing and implementing an Election Act. He was also an advisor to the Chief Electoral Officer on UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slovenia. In 1998, Reid was appointed Information Commissioner of Canada for a seven-year term. The Information Commissioner of Canada is an independent ombudsman who investigates complaints from those who believe they have been denied rights to government information under the Access to Information Act.

It has been based in Woodstock, New York since 1987. History The company was started in Brooklyn in 1976 as Spector Guitars, Inc. by Stuart Spector and Alan Charney. Originally both were members of the Brooklyn Woodworkers Coop that shared a shop in an old factory building at 444 12th Street in the Park Slope area. Stuart was originally taught machine woodworking by Billy Thomas, a friend and founder of the co-op. The first guitar was made totally by hand in Stuart‚Äôs apartment in 1974. The business started in 1976 with sales to Gracin Music on 48th St in Manhattan. Both G-1 electric guitars and SB-1 basses designed by Stuart were in the original product line. Among the other members of the coop was Ned Steinberger, who had recently completed training in furniture design at the Cooper Hewitt museum. He became interested in the work Spector was doing and offered to design an instrument. The result was the NS bass guitar with an elegant ergonomically curved design and the neck-thru-body construction that Spector was already utilizing. The first NS-1 bass was handcrafted in March 1977. The two-pickup model, NS-2, debuted in 1979. By 1977 Spector had expanded to renting an entire floor just below the coop encompassing 4000 square feet. The cost of the space including rent, heat, and electricity was $450 per month. The first full-time employee was Vinny Fodera who eventually went on to start his own highly esteemed line of Fodera basses. Among the resources available in the area were hardwood importers nearby on the docks of the Brooklyn waterfront as well as metal wholesalers. The first venture into mass production techniques was fostered by a contract to supply replacement guitar necks for sale by the DiMarzio Company on Staten Island. This led to the development of equipment to sand the finished shape of the neck and advances in mounting frets. Involvement in OEM operations was curtailed in late 1982 in order to concentrate on Spector bass production. 1982 also saw the addition of Harold \\"Hap\\" Kuffner as the domestic and international sales manager for Spector. This resulted in a significant increase in the number of both domestic and foreign dealers and distributors. In 1983 a white Spector NS-2 bass was sold to Sting by Dan Martin (owner of the St. Charles Guitar Exchange) at the start of the Synchronicity tour and was played and filmed for the rest of the worldwide tour. Years later that bass was donated to the museum of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio where it has been on display. In late 1985 the Spector brand was sold to Kramer Guitars of Neptune New Jersey and all equipment and production were moved to the new Kramer facility. Stuart and Alan remained on as supervisors and consultants and production was greatly expanded reaching a maximum of 100 pcs per month. During this period, production was started in Korea of the NS-2A model, enabling sales of the instruments to enter the mass market. By 1990 Kramer was forced into bankruptcy and all Spector production ceased. After a two-year hiatus, Stuart started a new company as Stuart Spector Designs Ltd near Woodstock, New York and introduced the SD bass which debuted at a NAMM Show in Atlantic City, New Jersey. A workspace was rented just outside of Woodstock which is still in use today. With the addition of business partner PJ Rubal, Stuart and PJ continued to grow the company‚Äôs instrument model offerings, sales, and artist roster. A consulting visit to Czechoslovakia in 1987 led eventually to a long term relationship with a factory there that is now known as NBE Corp and produces the Euro line of Spector basses which are sold worldwide. By 1998 Stuart was finally able to purchase back the rights to the Spector trademark and resume producing basses in their complete original format. Production of the USA basses and guitars continues near Woodstock, New York. 2006 saw the introduction of CNC machining technology and a subsequent expansion of models and features. Among the new items were the ARC6 and Kenmare electric guitars and the CTB carved top bass. Starting in 2015 Korg USA has managed import bass distribution in the USA & Canada which includes the very popular Euro basses from the Czech Republic and the Legend Series produced in Asia. In early 2019, the announcement was made that Stuart Spector was retiring and that the company was sold to Korg USA. Former co-owner PJ Rubal would be staying on with the company in some capacity for at least a year.

A crash cart or code cart (crash trolley in UK medical jargon) or \\"MAX cart\\" is a set of trays/drawers/shelves on wheels used in hospitals for transportation and dispensing of emergency medication/equipment at site of medical/surgical emergency for life support protocols (ACLS/ALS) to potentially save someone's life. The cart carries instruments for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other medical supplies while also functioning as a support litter for the patient. The crash cart was originally designed and patented by ECRI Institute founder, Joel J. Nobel, M.D., while a surgical resident at Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Hospital in 1965. MAX helped enhance hospital's efficiency in emergencies by enabling doctors and nurses to save time, thereby increasing the chances of saving a life. The contents of a crash cart vary from hospital to hospital, but typically contain the tools and drugs needed to treat a person in or near cardiac arrest. These include but are not limited to: * Monitor/defibrillators, suction devices, and bag valve masks (BVMs) of different sizes * Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) drugs such as epinephrine, atropine, amiodarone, lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, dopamine, and vasopressin * First line drugs for treatment of common problems such as: adenosine, dextrose, epinephrine for IM use, naloxone, nitroglycerin, and others * Drugs for rapid sequence intubation: succinylcholine or another paralytic, and a sedative such as etomidate or midazolam; endotracheal tubes and other intubating equipment * Drugs for peripheral and central venous access * Pediatric equipment (common pediatric drugs, intubation equipment, etc.) * Other drugs and equipment as chosen by the facility Hospitals typically have internal intercom codes used for situations when someone has suffered a cardiac arrest or a similar potentially fatal condition outside of the emergency department or intensive care unit (where such conditions already happen frequently and do not require special announcements). When such codes are given, hospital staff and volunteers are expected to clear the corridors, and to direct visitors to stand aside as the crash cart and a team of physicians, pharmacists and nurses may come through at any moment. (See Code Blue.) History in the United States The first cardiac crash cart was created in 1962 at Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, home to the first Cardiac Care Unit in the country.Colby, William H. Unplugged: Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America The first crash cart was fabricated by the father of one of the doctors. It contained an Ambu bag, defibrillator paddles, a bed board and endotracheal tubes. In computing In the computer industry, the term crash cart is used, by analogy to its original meaning in medicine, to mean a cart that can be connected to a server that is malfunctioning so badly that remote access to it is impossible, the intention being to \\"resuscitate\\" the server to the point where remote administration works again. Crash carts most commonly include a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, because most servers in a modern high-density environment do not have user input/output devices. Crash carts are a method of last resort in data centers which employ various forms of out-of-band management. In those cases it is used for equipment which does not support the requisite out-of-band infrastructure (OOBI) features or in cases where the OOBI devices (concentrators, switches, terminal servers, etc.) or services themselves have failed. The term \\"crash cart\\" can also refer to a bootable removable medium containing an operating system and any relevant software used to recover computer equipment (such as a server or PC) from a state of failure. This is done when such recovery is not possible using the computer's existing operating system and software. Crash carts in this sense are historically tape cartridges (\\"carts\\") or more recently, external or removable hard drives.

After Yuan Shao's death, Yuan Tan engaged his younger brother, Yuan Shang, in a power struggle over their father's territories. He sought help from his father's rival, Cao Cao, and defeated Yuan Shang with Cao's help. However, the alliance between Yuan Tan and Cao Cao was eventually broken and Yuan was defeated and killed in the Battle of Nanpi by Cao Cao's troops. Pacifying Qing Province In 193, Yuan Shao appointed Yuan Tan to the position of Inspector of Qing Province, in opposition to Gongsun Zan's officer Tian Kai. Tan left Ye to station at Pingyuan; however, when he arrived Qing Province, the Yuan forces only controlled one city within the province, and Yuan Tan's position was only a commandant. He fought Tian Kai to a truce in 193. Still, Yuan Tan managed to seize Beihai State from Kong Rong in the east in 196, and expelled Tian Kai in the north to expand his domain in the area.(When [Yu√°n] T√°n first reached Qƒ´ng Province, he was Regional Commander, and not yet Inspector; later T√†iz«î appointed him as Inspector. His land from the H√© on west, overall did not surpass P√≠ngyu√°n and nothing more. Therefore he to the north supplanted Ti√°n K«éi, to the east attacked K«íng R√≥ng, dazzling troops along the sea, at the time the common people had no master, and happily joined him.)Ji«îzh≈çu Ch≈´nqi≈´ Yuan Tan was quite successful on his expansion, and was welcomed by the common people of the Province.Records of the Three Kingdoms Scroll 6 Wei Book 6 Note Spring and Autumn Annual of the Nine Provinces Although adept in military, Yuan Tan was inept at civil matters ‚Äì the officials he picked plundered the countryside and accepted bribery, and the taxes collected were below one third of the estimated tax revenue.(However he trusted and employed various petty men, enjoyed receiving flattering words, was unrestrained in will and extravagant and excessive, not knowing the hardships of sowing and reaping. Hu√† Y√†n and K«íng Sh√πn all were treacherous flatterers and petty men, but he trusted in them as belly and heart; W√°ng Xi≈´ and others were only given office and nothing more. However he was able to care for guest retainers, admired reputation and respected scholars, sending his wife‚Äôs younger brother to command troops inside, sending him to plunder from F√∫j«êng outside, robbing fields; he separately sent two officers to recruit soldiers from subordinate counties, those with bribes were allowed to go, those without were seized. The poor and weak were many, so that they fled and hid in the hills and wilderness, and troops were sent to capture and search, as if hunting for birds and beasts. Cities with ten thousand households, the registers did not pass several hundred, and collecting taxes, out of three not even one entered. He sought worthy scholars, but did not obtain them; he did not deploy armies by season, and the resident clan factions, he also could not punish.) Ji«îzh≈çu Ch≈´nqi≈´ Internal conflict within Yuan Shao's forces In 200, Yuan Tan accompanied his father at the Battle of Guandu against Cao Cao. Yuan Shao, however, was defeated in the conflict and fell sick shortly after returning to his base city of Ye. All along, Yuan Shao had intended to pass on his legacy to his youngest son Yuan Shang, who was favoured by Yuan Shao for his good looks, but the successorship had not been clearly established by the time Yuan Shao died in 202. Many officials intended to make Yuan Tan the successor according to seniority of the heirs, but Shen Pei and Pang Ji, two influential advisors, supported Yuan Shang and pushed for the latter to succeed Yuan Shao.Records of Three Kingdoms Scroll 6 Wei Book 6 When Yuan Tan rushed back from his duty elsewhere, he could not revert the situation, the only thing he could do was to proclaim himself \\"General of Chariots and Cavalry\\" (ËªäÈ®éÂ∞áËªç), his father's former title. In autumn of the same year, Cao Cao launched an offensive against the Yuan brothers. Yuan Tan allied his brother and stationed his troops in Liyang (northeast of present-day Xun County, Henan) against the attack but his request for more troops was turned down by Yuan Shang, who feared his elder brother would take over military control.Records of Three Kingdoms Scroll 6 Wei Book 6 Yuan Shang then left Shen Pei to defend Ye and personally led a force to Liyang to assist in the defense. For half a year the battle went on, but the Yuan brothers eventually gave up the city after a major defeat, and retreated to Ye. Alliance with Cao Cao Cao Cao's advisor Guo Jia then suggested that the Yuan brothers would fight between themselves in the absence of an external enemy. Cao Cao took the counsel and withdrew his troops to attack Liu Biao in Jing Province (present-day Hubei and Hunan). Meanwhile, Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang indeed battled each other. After suffering initial defeats, Yuan Tan retreated to Pingyuan and sent out an emissary seeking to ally with Cao Cao. Cao Cao agreed, but his actual intention of allying with Yuan Tan was to make it easier to defeat Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi, and with them gone, he would then eliminate Yuan Tan easily. On the other hand, however, Yuan Tan was trying to make use of the alliance to strengthen his position. He contacted two of his father‚Äôs former generals, who had surrendered to Cao Cao, and gave them seals of authority, in hope they would defect to him at the right time after Yuan Shang was taken care of.Records of Three Kingdoms Scroll 6 Wei Book 6 But his plan was sensed by Cao Cao, who even promised to marry a daughter to Yuan Tan in order to let his guard down. Death Yuan Shang soon led a force to attack his brother again but retreated after he had heard the news of Cao Cao's siege on Ye. His returning force tried to converge with that in the city but the attempt was foiled. The defeated Yuan Shang then escaped to Zhongshan, and was attacked by a vengeful Yuan Tan. Merging Yuan Shang's surrendered troops into his own, Yuan Tan violated the alliance with Cao Cao by taking Ganling (present-day Qinghe County, Hebei), Anping County, Bohai Commandery (vicinity of present-day Cangzhou, Hebei) and Hejian into his realm. Cao Cao soon turned his force against Yuan Tan, who retreated to Nanpi. In 205, Yuan Tan was eventually defeated and killed in action in the Battle of Nanpi against Cao Cao. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In Chapter 33 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Yuan Tan was said to have sent Xin Ping as an emissary to Cao Cao while besieged in Nanpi to seek surrender but was declined. When Xin returned, Yuan accused him of treason since his brother Xin Pi served in Cao Cao's camp. The undue accusation angered Xin so much that he soon died, much to Yuan's regret. The next morning, Yuan placed the commoners, who were hastily armed during the night, in front of his troops and marched into battle with Cao Cao outside the city. Yuan was subsequently killed in battle by Cao Hong. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Although the studio itself was somewhat rudimentary in its set-up and particularly basic with regard to some of the dated equipment employed by Perry, it was nonetheless the breeding ground for some of Jamaica's most innovative sounds and recording techniques in the latter half of the 1970s. Innovative musical techniques From a technological standpoint, the Black Ark was at the low end in comparison to the international music recording standards of its day. The studio's legendary reputation stems from the innovative production techniques employed by Perry to create sounds that baffled his contemporaries, and which have continued to be a source of amazement to later generations of music producers. An example of Perry's inventive style was his ability to overdub layers of sound effects and instrumentation on each recording track of a basic 4-track machine, with such precise timing and in such a way that the resulting sound would destroy the competition from Jamaica's other top producers using the latest 16-track mixing consoles. Perry once buried microphones at the base of a palm tree and thumped it rhythmically to produce a mystifying bass drum effectPerry referred to this particular invention as a way to record what he called \\"the living African heartbeat.\\" Veal, p. 160. and his drum booth at the Black Ark was for a time surrounded with chicken wire to further his distinctive sound.Katz, p. 332. Many of his songs are layered with a variety of subtle effects created from broken glass, ghastly sighs and screeches, crying babies, falling rain and cow noises.Veal, p. 74. While it was thought to believe that Perry recorded the \\"mooing\\" noises from actual cows, it was actually the baritone voice of Watty Burnett through a tin foil laced cardboard tube that produced the cow-like noises.Katz, pp. 283-284. These and other notable recording techniques helped define the Black Ark sound, as well as Lee Perry's creative legacy. Perry was known for his eccentric and superstitious behavior during production sessions. He would often \\"bless\\" his recording equipment with mystical invocations, blow ganja smoke onto his tapes while recording, bury unprotected tapes in the soil outside of his studio, and surround himself with burning candles and incense, whose wax and dust remnants were allowed to infest his electronic recording equipment. He would also spray tapes with a variety of fluids, including urine, blood and whisky, ostensibly to enhance their spiritual properties. Later commentators have drawn a direct relationship between the decay of Perry's facility and the unique sounds he was able to create from his studio equipment. Perry has described his relationship to the studio thus: Musicians and the Black Ark Artists who were produced and/or recorded at the Black Ark include Bob Marley and The Wailers, Junior Byles, The Congos, Junior Murvin, Max Romeo, Mighty Diamonds, The Heptones, Augustus Pablo and Jah Lion.Katz, p. 277. Paul Douglas mentions, \\"Scratch had a particular sound and everybody was fascinated by his sound. He had this way of putting things together; it was just his sound and it influenced a lot of people. I‚Äôve even gone to the Black Ark with Eric Gale for that Negril album; I remember myself and Val Douglas, we laid some tracks there, Eric Gale overdubbed stuff on there, but I honestly don‚Äôt remember what happened to it.\\" Lee Perry and his studio were also formative in creating the highly innovative reggae subgenre called dub, in which the producer/engineer becomes the focus of the music, manipulating a pre-recorded track and creating something entirely new using the mixing console as nothing less than an instrument. Perry worked with The Clash and Paul McCartney and his band Wings had recorded there between 1972 and 1979. The end In 1979, following years of increasingly bizarre and erratic behavior, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, armed with a magic marker, covered every available surface of the Black Ark with impenetrable writings before allegedly burning it to the ground. This event, with the loss of the studio's unique sound and a hiatus in Perry's extraordinary creative skills, effectively ended an era during which much of Jamaica's most innovative sounds had captured the world of music. However, it has been related by several Perry family members that the studio in fact caught fire in 1983 after an ill-fated attempt to rebuild it, the result of an electrical accident. More often than not, Perry has claimed that he personally destroyed the Black Ark due to \\"unclean spirits\\" - an allusion to some of the undesirable people who were constantly at the Black Ark in later years. There are also stories that Perry was being blackmailed by gangsters who wanted a cut of the record profits. Perry himself stated in an interview with clashmusic.com regarding the fire, \\"Too much stress in Jamaica, all the time. Everybody want money, everybody want paid. Everyone got problem and want me to solve their problem. Nobody gave me anything, people just took everything. Everybody take this, and take that. So the atmosphere in the Black Ark studio was changing; it wasn‚Äôt like it used to be. Then I decided to make a sacrifice as the energy wasn‚Äôt good anymore.\\" Shortly thereafter, he moved to London and then Switzerland.

It is south of Emerald on the Gregory Highway. It is the southern terminus of the Gregory Highway and the northern terminus of the Dawson Highway. It is northwest of Brisbane. In the , Springsure had a population of 1,103 people.  Geography  Today, Springsure is a pastoral settlement serving cattle farms, and sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea plantations. Springsure is the hub for several coal mines such as the Minerva Mine and the Rolleston Mine. Significant exploration is ongoing in the district. It is also a staging point for expeditions to the Carnarvon National Park. History Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. Wadja (also known as Wadjigu, Wadya, Wadjainngo, Mandalgu, and Wadjigun) is an Australian Aboriginal language in Central Queensland. The language region includes the local government areas of the Aboriginal Shire of Woorabinda and Central Highlands Region, including the Blackdown Tablelands. the Comet River, and the Expedition Range, and the towns of Woorabinda, Springsure and Rolleston. The town takes its name from a pastoral run name used from 1861, so named because of a permanent spring on the run. The area was originally occupied by Aboriginal people, for thousands of years. Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to explore the area between 1843 and 1845. His favourable reports encouraged settlers to move in and settle the land whose domains were those of Aboriginal groups. In 1861 squatter Horatio Wills and a party of Victorian settlers arrived near modern- day Springsure in 1861. Two weeks later, 19 men women and children, including Wills, were killed by Aboriginal Australian people, the Kairi or Gayiri, in the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre, the largest massacre of European settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. At least 15 Aboriginal men, women and children were killedT. Bottoms (2013) Conspiracy of Silence: Queensland's frontier killing times, Allen & Unwin, pp.53-54 by the Queensland Native Police and militias of local European colonists and their employees, in a series of reprisals over the months that followed. However, the massacre of the 19 European family members was itself a retaliatory response to an earlier shooting of fugitive murderer who was Gayiri tribesman by Jesse Gregson (manager of nearby Rainsworth Station) with Second Lieutenant Alfred March Patrick and Native Police Troops in his command.T Bottoms (2013) Conspiracy of Silence: Queensland's frontier killing times, Allen & Unwin, p.54 Prior to the massacre of the 19 colonists, Second Lieutenant Patrick had complained, in early 1861, to Charles Dutton (lessee of Bauhinia Downs pastoral lease 148 km south-east of Springsure) that other officers in the Queensland Native Police \\"...had been able to bag their first Aborigine after only a few weeks in the Force; he had served for six months and still had not yet killed a black.\\"G. Reid, \\"From Hornet Bank to Cullin-La-Ringo\\", Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 18 May 1981, p.69 The Old Rainworth Fort was built in 1862 by the colonists of Springsure in order to defend themselves from future raids by Aboriginals. Horatio's son, star cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills, survived the massacre, and remained on site until 1864. The town was surveyed by Charles Frederick Gregory in August 1863. Presbyterian Church, Springsure, 2006 The Springsure Presbyterian Church in Charles Street opened about 1866. It closed in March 2011 after 145 years.

Father Thomas Andrew Sweeney arrived in Springsure to replace Rev. Father Bucas as the Catholic priest for the parish. Sweeney saw there was a need for a Catholic school in Springure and set about building a school and a convent for its teachers in August 1925. The architect was Roy Chipps and the builder E.H. Fletcher (both of Rockhampton). In January 1926 the school and the convent opened in a ceremony led by Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton, Joseph Shiel. The convent and school were under the control of Sister Mary Bonaventure of the Sisters of Mercy. The school opened on 2 February 1926 with 64 children. It was originally known as The Convent of the Little Flower, but later changed to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart.

U.S. Route 33 during its brief concurrency with U.S. Route 50 and State Route 32 in Athens. State Route 32, also known as SR 32 and the James A. Rhodes Appalachian Highway, is a major east‚Äìwest highway across the southern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. It is the eighth longest state route in Ohio. It leads from eastern Cincinnati, near the border between the neighborhoods of Linwood, Mount Lookout, and Columbia-Tusculum, to the Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge across the Ohio River in Belpre. Except in Belpre, leading up to the bridge into West Virginia, the entire route outside Cincinnati's beltway (Interstate 275) is a high-speed four-lane divided highway, forming the Ohio portion of Corridor D of the Appalachian Development Highway System. This corridor continues east across the Ohio River over the Blennerhassett Island Bridge. History The Batavia Turnpike and Miami Bridge Company was incorporated and chartered by the state of Ohio. It built a road, which was \\"about finished\\" as of 1841, beginning at the Wooster Turnpike (Eastern Avenue), crossing the Little Miami River on the Union Bridge, and turning east to Batavia. The Ohio Turnpike to Bethel split after the Little Miami was crossed. The passage of the McGuire Bill in 1911 led to the designation of a large number of Inter-County Highways to be maintained by the Ohio Department of Highways. This network included the Cincinnati-Batavia Road (ICH 41) and Batavia-Winchester Road (ICH 125), connecting Cincinnati to Batavia, Williamsburg, Mt. Orab, Sardinia, Winchester, and beyond to an intersection with the West Union-Belfast Road (ICH 122) south of Seaman (where Graces Run Road now meets State Route 247). This entire route from Cincinnati to south of Seaman was designated and signed as State Route 74 in 1923. The route left downtown Cincinnati on Eastern Avenue, shared with State Route 7 (now U.S. Route 52) and State Route 25 (now State Route 125). SR 7 left at Davis Lane (now Airport Road), while SR 25 and SR 74 turned onto Beechmont Avenue, splitting after crossing the Little Miami River. By 1925, the east end of SR 74 had been realigned and extended, heading east from Winchester through Seaman and continuing through Peebles to State Route 73 northwest of Rarden; the old alignment (Graces Run Road) reverted to local control. Along with U.S. Route 50, US 52, and SR 125, SR 74 was moved to Columbia Parkway in the early 1940s, and in the early 1950s it was removed from downtown Cincinnati to its present terminus. Due to the existence of Interstate 74 west of Cincinnati, the number was changed to State Route 32 in 1962, with SR 74 signs being removed in June 1963 after a period of dual signage. The designation had originally been applied to a route running from the Indiana border west of Celina to Marysville; in 1938 it was replaced by U.S. Route 33 east of St. Marys, and a rerouted State Route 54, later State Route 29, to the west.Ohio maps: * (first one to show the Inter-County Highways) * (lists the Inter-County Highways by name) * (shows the routing in Cincinnati; shows the original SR 32) * * (describes the renumbering) * (shows the proposed Appalachian Highway) The state relocated the road between Mount Carmel and Batavia as a four-lane divided highway in the early 1960s, several years after the parallel State Route 125 was widened (but not realigned). Because this was done before or during the renumbering, the old road here is known as Old State Route 74, rather than Old State Route 32 to the east. Improvement of the rest of the road did not take place until after it was added to the Appalachian Development Highway System in 1965. This proposed Appalachian Highway‚Äîpart of Corridor D‚Äîwas to run across the southern part of the state from Interstate 275 outside Cincinnati to Belpre. From the east end of SR 32 east of Peebles, the route was to continue northeast, joining State Route 772 near Elmgrove, and following State Route 124 beyond Jackson to Roads. After continuing northeast to Radcliff, it would parallel State Route 346 and a portion of State Route 143, merging with U.S. Route 50 west of Albany and following it past Athens and Coolville to Belpre. A never-built branch, planned as part of Corridor B, would have followed State Route 73 and State Route 348 from east of Peebles to Lucasville on U.S. Route 23 (Corridor C). In 1998, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) inspected a section of SR 32 in Jackson County due to repeated pavement failure and pothole subsidence featured in the median. Abandoned underground mines were visible near the roadway, but there were no mine maps available for the area. An electrical resistivity tomography was conducted to see if there were mine voids underneath the roadway. Several pits at deep were excavated revealing that mine voids were detected. In response to the tests, ODOT closed the highway east of Wellston and began excavating the roadway to remediate the mine subsidence in November 1998. Work to repair the roadway was completed in March 1999. In 2002, two interchanges were constructed along SR 32. Olive Branch‚ÄìStonelick Road intersection in Clermont County was constructed into an interchange. The $7 million project was jointly funded by Clermont County and ODOT's Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC). The interchange project was awarded the Donald C. Schramm Award by the American Society of Highway Engineers (ASHE) Triko Valley Section in 2002. Work also began on replacing two at-grade intersections of SRs 124 and 327 into a single interchange near Wellston in Jackson County. The $9 million project was funded jointly by the Federal Highway Safety Infrastructure program and ODOT's Highway Safety Program (HSP). The project was completed in July 2004 at cost of $12.5 million, an increase of $3.5 million than originally estimated. Future The portion of SR 32 in Clermont, Brown, Highland, Adams, and Pike counties is under consideration as the eastward continuation of Interstate 74 from Cincinnati to Piketon, where it would connect with Interstate 73. This would necessitate replacing at-grade crossings (many of which currently have traffic signals) with either limited access interchanges or totally eliminating access. A construction project that is a part of the Eastern Corridor, is redesigning SR 32 from Interstate 275 to Batavia. This segment of construction began in 2012. The plan is to remove all signalized intersections east of Interstate 275 and eventually replace it with a limited-access highway to Batavia. Funding for the final segments, which call for the construction of interchanges at Glen Este-Withamsville and Bach-Buxton Roads, amounts to $83.1 million. The project funding was awarded in November 2019 with construction beginning in 2021. A feasibility study is underway at the Brooks-Malott Road intersection in Mt. Orab. The study calls for the construction of an interchange.

It consists of a series of short sequences loosely inspired by Dr. David Reuben's 1969 book of the same name. The film was an early success for Allen, grossing over $18 million in North America alone against a $2 million budget, making it the 13th highest-grossing film of 1972. Film structure The credits at the start and close of the film are played over a backdrop of a large mass of white rabbits, to the tune of \\"Let's Misbehave\\" by Cole Porter. The film consists of seven vignettes, as follows: # Do Aphrodisiacs Work? A court jester (Woody Allen) gives a love potion to the Queen (Lynn Redgrave) but is foiled by her chastity belt. There are references to Shakespeare's Hamlet throughout. # What Is Sodomy? Dr. Ross (Gene Wilder) falls in love with the partner of an Armenian patient, a sheep. # Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm? Allen's homage to Italian film-making in general and Casanova 70, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Federico Fellini in particular, about Gina (Louise Lasser), a woman who can only reach orgasm in public. # Are Transvestites Homosexuals? Sam Musgrave (Lou Jacobi), a middle-aged married man, experiments with women's clothes. # What Are Sex Perverts? A parody of the television game show What's My Line? called What's My Perversion?, filmed in B&W; kinescope-style and hosted by Jack Barry. The four panelists who attempt to guess the contestant's perversion are Regis Philbin, Robert Q. Lewis, Pamela Mason, and Toni Holt. After they fail to guess that the contestant's perversion is \\"Likes to expose himself on subways,\\" a second segment of the show is presented, in which a selected viewer (in this case a rabbi) gets to act out his bondage and humiliation fantasy while his wife eats pork. # Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate? Victor (Woody Allen), a sex researcher, and Helen Lacey (Heather MacRae), a journalist, visit a Dr. Bernardo (John Carradine), a researcher who formerly worked with Masters and Johnson but now has his own laboratory complete with a lab assistant named Igor (Ref Sanchez). After they see a series of bizarre sexual experiments underway at the lab and realize that Bernardo is insane, they escape before Helen becomes the subject of another of his experiments. The segment culminates with a scene in which the countryside is terrorized by a giant runaway breast created by the researcher. The first part of this segment is a parody of Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster, while the second part parodies The Blob. # What Happens During Ejaculation? The NASA-like mission control center in a man's brain (headed by Tony Randall and featuring Burt Reynolds as the switchboard operator) is seen, as he gets involved in a sexual clinch with an NYU graduate (Erin Fleming) (knowledge that she is a graduate of NYU assures coital success). As he achieves orgasm, the soldier-like, white-uniformed sperm (one of them played by bespectacled Allen, coached by another sperm played by Robert Walden) are dispatched paratrooper-style into the great unknown. CastCritical response The film holds an 89% \\"Fresh\\" rating of on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews. An August 1972 review by Time said that many of the film's ideas \\"sound good on paper\\" but that the \\"skits wind down rather than take off from the ideas\\"; the film includes \\"some broad, funny send-ups of other movies (Fantastic Voyage, La notte), and its fair share of memorably wacky lines\\" but that \\"overall it is just Woody marking time and being merely a little funnier\\". The Time Out Film Guide noted that some of the film's sketches are \\"dross, but the parodies of Antonioni (all angst and alienation of a wife who can achieve orgasm only in public places) and of TV panel games ('What's My Perversion?') are brilliantly accurate and very funny. Best of all is the sci-fi parody entitled What Happens During Ejaculation?\\"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask movie review - Film - Time Out London In 2004, Christopher Null, founder of filmcritic.com, called it a \\"minor classic and Woody Allen's most absurd film ever\\".Film review by Christopher Null, founder of filmcritic.com Censorship The film was banned in Ireland on March 20, 1973. A cut version was passed in 1979 and released theatrically in 1980, removing both a bestiality reference (\\"the greatest lay I ever had\\", referring to a sheep) and a man having sex with a bread loaf, The ban on the uncut version was eventually lifted.

Featuring characters from A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories, the film is the third theatrical animated film in Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise and DisneyToon Studios's third adaptation of Winnie the Pooh stories, following The Tigger Movie (2000) and Piglet's Big Movie (2003). The film was released theatrically on February 11, 2005. Plot One day, Winnie the Pooh and his friends hear a strange noise and find a set of large, circular footprints in the Hundred Acre Wood. The friends believe that there is a strange creature known as a \\"heffalump\\" in the woods. Rabbit organizes an expedition to go try to catch it. Roo wants to come along, but the others tell him he is too young and small to go. Despite this, Roo slips out on his own in search of the heffalump. He finds one; a playful young creature named Heffridge Trumpler Brompet Heffalump IV‚Äî\\"Lumpy\\" for short. Roo is afraid of his captive at first but the two quickly become friends and play. After a while, Lumpy hears his mother calling for him to come home. Roo wants Lumpy to meet all of his friends first, and they head towards the Hundred Acre Wood. Lumpy hesitates, thinking that the \\"creatures\\" that live there are scary, but Roo reassures him. The Hundred Acre Wood is deserted, as everyone else is still out searching for the heffalump. Roo and Lumpy continue playing, making a mess of Pooh's house and Rabbit's garden. The two friends hear Lumpy's mother calling him again. They search for Lumpy's mother, but she is nowhere to be seen. Lumpy uses his trunk to call to her, but it does not work. After hours of searching, Lumpy assumes that they will never find her, and starts to cry. Roo consoles Lumpy with a song he learned from Kanga. Then, Roo gets an idea: they could go find his mother, and see if she can help Lumpy. Meanwhile, the others return home to find Pooh's house and Rabbit's garden a mess. They conclude that the heffalump has invaded. When Lumpy and Roo are discovered, Rabbit thinks that Lumpy has captured Roo. He and the others chase Lumpy through the heffalump traps they set up earlier in the film. Lumpy evades the traps, but Roo gets caught in the last one as Lumpy escapes into the woods. Roo frees himself from the trap, and runs to find Lumpy trapped in a giant cage. Lumpy is upset and hurt, thinking that Roo has lied to him about the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood being friendly. Roo tries to free Lumpy and apologizes for everything. Finally, Roo notices a rope at the top of the cage. He climbs up and unties it, freeing a very grateful Lumpy. Kanga, watching the two interact from behind a nearby tree, realizes that the heffalump is her son's friend. Rabbit, Pooh, Tigger, and Piglet arrive and lasso Lumpy. Roo yells at them to stop. Kanga tells Rabbit to have Roo explain himself. He tells the others that Heffalumps are not scary or mean. While Roo is explaining this, Lumpy stumbles and accidentally knocks Roo into a pile of giant, heavy logs forming a makeshift bridge over a ditch. Lumpy and Roo's other friends try to rescue Roo, but the logs are too heavy for them to move. Lumpy gets an idea, and tries to call out to his mother. After a few tries, he finally gets it right. Lumpy's mother comes and tosses the logs aside, freeing Roo. Lumpy's mother is very proud that he has learned how to call out to her. Roo's other friends realize that the \\"monster\\" they were all afraid of was just a mother looking for her baby. They apologize and befriend Lumpy and his mother. Roo and Lumpy get a little more time to play together before Lumpy has to go home.

Heffalumps were first mentioned in the original Winnie-the-Pooh books. They appeared in a nightmare sequencealong with their fellow scary creatures, the woozlesin 1968's Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. Though heffalumps and woozles have appeared in other Disney Pooh media, such as the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series, this was the first theatrical film to feature a \\"real\\" heffalump. Lumpy's design is similar to the heffalumps seen in the 1968 featurette and the song \\"The Horribly Hazardous Heffalumps!\\" is in the same style as \\"Heffalumps and Woozles\\" from Blustery Day. Carly Simon came up with Lumpy's full name, Heffridge Trumpler Brompet Heffalump, IV. This was the final theatrically released film to feature voice actor John Fiedler as Piglet. It also marked the final Pooh film to be released in Fiedler's lifetime, as he died four months later from cancer. This was also the final production of Walt Disney Animation Japan, as Disney would shutter the studio in June 2004, shortly after completing the film, as well as a year before the film's release. Home media Pooh's Heffalump Movie was released on DVD and VHS on May 24, 2005 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the film was released on July 11, 2005, and later in a trilogy DVD on November 7, 2011, along with The Tigger Movie and Winnie the Pooh. Songs American singer- songwriter Carly Simon wrote five new songs exclusively for the film, and performed four of them. \\"The Name Game\\" features Kyle Stanger and Nikita Hopkins, as Lumpy and Roo. On \\"The Horribly Hazardous Heffalumps!\\" Simon is accompanied by Jim Cummings, John Fiedler, Ken Sansom, Peter Cullen, and Nikita Hopkins. Two songs from Simon's earlier soundtrack for Piglet's Big Movie are also included on the soundtrack, \\"Winnie the Pooh (Theme Song)\\" and \\"With A Few Good Friends\\", in which Simon is joined by her children Ben Taylor and Sally Taylor. The soundtrack also features one instrumental track entitled \\"The Promise\\" by Joel McNeely, as well as seven classic Winnie The Pooh songs written by The Sherman Brothers. ;Track listing # \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" ‚Äì Carly Simon featuring Ben Taylor # \\"The Horribly Hazardous Heffalumps!\\" ‚Äì Carly Simon # \\"Little Mr. Roo\\" ‚Äì Carly Simon featuring Kath Soucie # \\"The Name Game\\" ‚Äì Kyle Stanger and Nikita Hopkins # \\"Shoulder to Shoulder\\" ‚Äì Carly Simon with The Heffalump Chorus # \\"In the Name of the Hundred Acre Wood/What Do You Do?\\" ‚Äì Carly Simon with The Heffalump Chorus # \\"With a Few Good Friends \\" ‚Äì Carly Simon featuring Ben Taylor and Sally Taylor # \\"The Promise\\" ‚Äì Joel McNeely # \\"Heffalumps and Woozles\\" ‚Äì Chorus # \\"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\\" ‚Äì Chorus # \\"Up, Down, and Touch the Ground\\" ‚Äì Chorus # \\"Rumbly in My Tumbly\\" ‚Äì Chorus # \\"Little Black Rain Cloud\\" ‚Äì Chorus # \\"Luv-a-Bye\\" ‚Äì Kira Small # \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" ‚Äì Chorus Reception=Box office The film made $5.8 million in its opening weekend, a per theater average of $2,296 from 2,529 theaters.

In the , Capella had a population of 1,010 people.  Geography  Capella is midway between Emerald and Clermont on the Gregory Highway. The highway passes through Capella from south to north as Capella's main street (also known as Peak Downs Street). Capella is served by the Capella railway station () on a railway line from Emerald to Blair Athol; it is a branch line of the Central Western railway line. The branch line also runs from north to south and is immediately adjacent and to the west of the highway. Capella Creek flows from east to west across the northern part of the locality to the immediate north of the town. Capella Creek is a tributary of the Nogoa River, which in turn is a tributary of the Fitzroy River which enters the Coral Sea.  History  Capella was founded on traditional Wangan land in the 1860s by graziers influenced by the good reports of Ludwig Leichhardt. The town takes its name from Capella Creek, which was in turn named after the star Capella. The Creek was probably named by surveyor Charles Frederick Gregory who, following the discovery of copper at Copperfield, about 60 kilometres to the north, surveyed three township sites in the Peak Downs area in 1862; Crinum Creek (Lilyvale), Capella, and Hoods Lagoon (Clermont). The town remained a small roadside stopping place halfway between Emerald, to the south, and Clermont, to the north, until a railway line was built connecting the two larger towns in 1882. The same year saw the establishment of a post office, which opened on 5 December. Capella Provisional School opened the following year, 1883, and became Capella State School in 1900. Land resumed from large pastoral runs was made available to small farm selectors in 1883 and small cropping and dairying became early industries; a Butter Factory was built in 1900 under the \\"Meat and Diary Encouragement Act.\\" By the late 1890s it was reported that \\"great improvements have been made at this place of late\\": in 1898 new offices for the Peak Downs Divisional Board (the fore- runner of the Peak Downs Shire Council) were opened, a number of new shops had been built, and the Old Exchange Hotel and the Peak Downs Hotel were renovated and re-opened. The early 20th century was a time of stable growth and development in the town, although the population only increased from about 250 in 1900 to 300 in 1930. The 1920s saw a great deal of building. Mrs M.J. Walsh opened a caf√© in October 1925 and a bakery opened shortly after. A new Roman Catholic church, St Joseph's, seating 200 people, was dedicated in April 1926. The same year also saw a new hall, picture theatre and Country Women's Association clubrooms built. A branch of the Queensland National Bank opened in 1930 and a new Catholic presbytery was built. The town became the council seat of the Shire of Peak Downs in 1927 and a new Shire Hall was built in 1936. The mid 1930s also saw the town's main streets kerbed and channelled and a \\"bitumen emulsion paved footpath\\" laid in the main street, Peak Down's Street. A town electricity supply was introduced in December, 1954 although other services had to wait for another decade or more, being introduced between 1962 (a town water supply) and 1982 (mains sewerage). In the 1950s the Queensland British Food Corporation introduced large-scale grain production into the district on land formerly used for grazing. A run of poor seasons led to the project's failure, but introduced new crops such as sunflower and sorghum. The Capella Hotel, on the corner of Peak Downs and Crinum Streets, was built in 1955. This was the site of the former Commercial Hotel, built in 1929, which was destroyed in a fire in February 1943. The destruction of the Commercial left the town with only one other hotel and the Peak Downs Shire Council, realising the need to provide additional accommodation for visitors to the town, undertook to build the Hotel as a function of local government. Several local authorities in Queensland built and ran their own licensed premises in the 1950s, including Rockhampton, Townsville and Winton. The new Capella Hotel was designed by Mr E.A. Hegvold and built by J.J. Booker and Sons, at a cost of ¬£33,000. The Hotel was officially opened on 7 May 1955. The Peak Downs district was part of the Brigalow Development Scheme in the 1960s with large-scale clearing of the brigalow scrub by mechanical means. The large new farming blocks opened up by the clearing of the Brigalow lent itself to the broadland growing of grain and cereal crops, particularly sunflower and sorghum. Bulk storage facilities for these new crops was built in 1964 and the population of the district increased with new farming families. Capella saw the opening of a range of new activities and facilities, including a district agricultural show (1961), Girl Guides (1966), a swimming pool (1969), and a pre-school centre (1978). Coal was discovered at Tieri, about 36 kilometres east of Capella, in 1982 and a large open-cut mine was developed. The mine boosted the economy of the area and the 1980s saw a number of new developments and buildings in Capella, including the Capella Cultural Centre and a pioneer village. The Capella School opened a secondary department in 1984, which separated to become the Capella State High School on 23 January 1989. In 2003 the security of Capella's water supply was assured by a pipeline to Tieri. At the 2006 census, the town had a population of 796. In 2008 the Shire of Peak Downs was amalgamated into the Central Highlands Regional Shire, with its seat in Emerald. In the 2011 census, Capella had a population of 926 people.  Economy  Silos in Capella, 2016 Today, it is a service town catering to the large coal-mining interests in the area as well as pastoralists and farmers.  Facilities  Peak Downs cemetery, 2016 The Peak Downs Shire cemetery is located in Walsh Street, Capella (). The cemetery has a memorial listing those who were buried in the first Capella Cemetery (1865-1899) located east of Capella. The Central Highlands Regional Council operates Capella Library which is located on Peak Downs Street. The Capella branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Hall at 87 Peak Downs Street.  Sport  Sport is a very big part of the town, especially Rugby League and Union. The Capella Cattledogs rugby union team made it to the grand final in 2007 against the Clermont Bushpigs.

His historically famous booklet titled 'Cry of a Stone' was written about 1619 and finally published in 1642, many years after his death in 1625. The work is an important pre-sailing Pilgrim account of the Leiden group's religious lives. Cushman was most likely one of the first Mayflower passengers when the ship sailed from London to Southampton to meet the Speedwell coming from Leiden. The Speedwell was later forced to be abandoned.Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick, \\"Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p. 226  Early life in England  Cushman was born in 1577 in Rolvenden, co. Kent and is believed to be the second son of Thomas Couchman (Cushman) and Ellen Hubbarde. The first known record of Robert Cushman appears in December 1597 in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Canterbury, co. Kent. City accounts provide information about eighteen-year-old Cushman's apprenticeship to grocer George Masters, being a second son who did not inherit land and moved to the city to become an apprentice. George Masters had the monopoly of tallow candle making which had been granted to him by the City of Canterbury, with city butchers being obliged to sell animal fat to him for candle production. The parish of St. George being especially malodorous laying between the cattle market on one side and the butcher's slaughterhouse on the other. Apprentice Robert Cushman lived in George Master's house in St. George the Martyr parish making tallow candles at least until 1599 and likely as late as 1602 or 1603.Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 pp. 226‚Äì228 In 1601 Cushman's mother Ellen, wife of Thomas Tilden, her second husband, was buried in the village of Ashford which is about fourteen miles south-east of Canterbury. Thomas Tilden, may possibly have been a Puritan, whose descendants later emigrated to Scituate in Plymouth Colony. Many of Robert Cushman's religious beliefs may have come from other Canterbury puritans and his attendance at illegal religious meetings known as 'conventicles.' The best view into his religious principles and possibly some other Mayflower Pilgrims can be found in his booklet titled 'The Cry of a Stone.' He wrote that the Church of England \\"is wanting and defective\\", a \\"superstitious custome\\" and he would not wish to worship \\"humane devices.\\" He wrote that he decided to seek instead the \\"nearest fellowship that the Saints can have in this world, [that] most resembleth heaven.\\" Cushman also wrote that \\"God's people are still few, and scarce one of a hundred..\\" perhaps thinking of himself as one of the select few.Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick, Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p. 228 Cushman's first problem with authorities came in 1603 while he was still apprenticed to George Masters. This involved the illegal distribution of libels (derogatory religious writings) in Canterbury by Cushman \\"of the parish of St. Andrew of Canterbury.\\" The libels were handwritten notices stating \\"Lorde have mercy uppon us\\" which were posted on church doors throughout Canterbury. The authorities ordered that the \\"lewd seditious persons\\" posting the libels be found, interrogated and committed to prison if they refused examination. Robert Cushman was arrested by the authorities and not providing satisfactory answers upon questioning, for \\"certain reasons\\" was committed to Westgate prison for one night. Friends of Cushman's from his prior parish of St. George were also involved in posting libels.Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick, Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p.229 In 1604 Cushman was prosecuted by the Court of High Commission for distribution of libels and by the archdeaconry court for non-attendance at his parish church of St. Andrew's. His first excommunication came on 16 January 1604 for not acknowledging his offence of complaining that he could not be edified at his parish church. Per his request, he was absolved on 15 October 1604. His second excommunication was on 12 November 1604 likely for the offence of spreading libels. Per his request, on 7 July 1605 absolution was granted and the sentence lifted. In 1605 Cushman completed his apprenticeship and became a freeman \\"grosser\\" for payment of four shillings and one pence. His surname was variously recorded as \\"Couchman\\" and \\"Cowchman,\\" which were two of several surnames applied to him in records of the time. Various close connections of Cushman were found in Canterbury parish records as well as those for apprenticeship and marriage. These persons likely thought of themselves as \\"Godly\\" and often were called 'Puritan.\\" Due to the fact that their conventicles were illegal and secret it is very difficult to research these associations other than to state that these kinship and marriages relationships seem to be true to form for Canterbury non-conformist society. In the pre-Leiden Pilgrim families of Nottingham and Lincolnshire, similar marriage and kinship relationships were found. In 1606 Cushman was involved in an additional religious disturbance when the rector of St. George's, Thomas Wilson, accused a St. George's the Martyr parishioner, Gilbert Gore, of \\"false erroneous and devilish opinions\\" contrary to the Church of England and \\"repugnant to the word of God.\\" Gore was spreading opinions about predestination that apparently was contrary to Church of England doctrine. Thomas Reader, likely Cushman's brother-in-law, testified that \\"Cushman of Canterbury was also of Gore's opinion.\\" And another St. George's parishioner stated that Cushman had been \\"corrupted \\" by Gore. There were many other depositions, mostly St. George parishioners, indicating the parish had a number of dissenters and a few Separatists. Several of these deponents were associated with Cushman in earlier religious controversies. Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick, Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p. 230 A number of Canterbury Pilgrims are known to have moved to Sandwich in Kent where they resided prior to sailing for Leiden, Holland, with the James Chilton family, as an example, moving from Canterbury about 1600. In February 1607/1608 is found the last Canterbury record for the Cushman family at the baptism of Robert's son Thomas at St. Andrews. The next record of the Cushman family appears in Leiden in 1611 when Cushman bought a house in Nonensteeg which was next to the university.Robert C. Cushman and Michael R. Paulick, Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p. 232  Cushman family in Leiden  Robert Cushman and his family emigrated to Leiden, Holland, sometime before 4 November 1611, where he was a woolcomber. In the year 1616, the year before his appointment as agent of the Leiden (Leyden) Church, Robert Cushman had three family losses. His wife Sarah died early in the year ‚Äì exact date unknown. One of their children had died in March and another in October.  Preparing for the voyage to the New World  Beginning in September 1617, Cushman spent much of his time in England, working on preparations for the voyage to the new colonyPilgrim Village Families Sketch: Robert Cushman (a collaboration between American Ancestors and New England Historic Genealogical Society) He, along with John Carver, became an agent of the Leiden (Leyden) Holland congregation for doing business in England.Robert E. Cushman and Franklin P.

In 1620 they were in Aldgate, London, staying at Heneage House, Duke's Place, from where they negotiated with Thomas Weston for financial backing from a group of merchants. Charles Edward Banks, 'The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers'(2006). Carver and Cushman quarrelled with Weston, and each other, over finances, contractual terms, shipping and provisions for the journey, to the point where Carver despaired of the whole venture. ‚ÄòWe have begun to build‚Äô, he said, ‚Äòand shall not be able to make an end.‚Äô Cushman talked of 'a flat schism' between them. After Weston had hired the Mayflower ship, Cushman and Carver, as purchasing agents for the Leiden congregation, began to secure supplies and provisions in London and Canterbury.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006), pp. 19, 22, 42  The More children  As the Separatists gathered in London, they were joined by the More children, who were placed under the care of Weston, Cushman, and Carver. John Carver and Robert Cushman had jointly agreed to find them guardians among the passengers.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p 28 The children were sent to the Mayflower by Samuel More, the husband of their mother Katherine, after an admission of her adultery. The children were to be indentured servants to certain passengers: Elinor, age eight, to Edward and Elizabeth Winslow; Jasper, seven, to the Carvers; and both Richard, five, and Mary, four, to William and Mary Brewster. All of the children except Richard died in the first winter of 1620.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War(New York: Viking, 2006) p. 26  Attempts to leave England on the Speedwell  The Mayflower sailed from London with its passengers at the end of July, 1620, to take on supplies and meet up with the Speedwell from Leiden at Southampton. When it was time to leave Southampton, in August 1620, Cushman made sure he joined his friends aboard the Speedwell, but the ship was not seaworthy. Cushman stated: \\"(S)he is as open and leaky as a sieve\\". Soon after Mayflower and Speedwell cleared the coast, they put in for repairs at Dartmouth, a port 75 miles west of Southampton. The repairs were completed on 17 August, but they were forced to remain in Dartmouth due to lack of wind. By then half their food had been eaten. In his writings Cushman was very concerned about this. Many of the passengers wanted to abandon the voyage, even though, to many, it meant losing everything they possessed. Cushman stated that the Mayflower captain refused to let them off. \\"(H)e will not hear them, nor suffer them to go ashore,\\" Cushman stated, \\"lest they should run away.\\" The months of tension had caught up with Cushman and he began to suffer a searing pain in his chest ‚Äì \\"a bundle of lead as it were, crushing my heart.\\" He felt he was going to die.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), pp. 18‚Äì19 Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 20 The two ships left Dartmouth and sailed more than 300 miles, but then they again had to turn back, this time to Plymouth in Devon, because of trouble on the Speedwell. The Speedwell had to be abandoned because she would never have survived the voyage. The trade-off for a safer passage was the reduction of the 120 passengers to about 100, who then had to be squeezed aboard a single ship. Among those from the Speedwell who did not board the Mayflower was the family of Cushman, who stated he expected at any moment to become meate for ye fishes.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 2.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 36 After the decision to abandon the Speedwell, Cushman and his family had priority to sail on the Mayflower but they declined ‚Äì probably because of Robert's illness. Arrival in Plymouth in 1621  Robert Cushman and his son Thomas traveled to Plymouth Colony aboard the Fortune in 1621. Cushman carried with him a patent to the New Plymouth colony in the name of Mr John Pierce of London, one of the Merchant Adventurers.Robert E. Cushman and Franklin P. Cole, Robert Cushman of Kent (1577‚Äì1625) : Chief Agent of the Plymouth Pilgrims (1617‚Äì1625) (General Society of Mayflower Descendants: 2005), 2nd Ed. edited by Judith Swan p. 64 Robert Cushman remained but a few weeks. His mission was to convince the settlers to accept the terms of their contract imposed by Thomas Weston and the London investors. This contract had incurred the resentment and anger of the Leiden contingent and they had angrily rejected it on 5 August 1620, the date of departure from Portsmouth. But Cushman found at Plymouth that the settlers had finally come to realise their situation and their need for assistance from London. Cushman did complete his mission, but left Plymouth on 13 December 1621, having already spent four months at sea, and left his son Thomas in the care of Governor Bradford.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 276‚Äì277 Bradford later reported on Cushman's visit to Plymouth that he \\"stayed not above fourteen days\\" and that the ship Fortune was \\"speedily dispatched away laden with (cargo) estimated to be worth near ¬£500.\\" On the voyage back to England, the Fortune was attacked by French pirates and was robbed of its valuable cargo, along with the possessions of crew and passengers.William Bradford History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), pp. 110, 122, 114 Cushman back in London 1622 Cushman arrived back in London, 17 February 1622. He was carrying with him a valuable document known as the Bradford- Winslow \\"Relation\\" ‚Äì (or historically known as 'Mourt's Relation') the detailed journal-account, that is, day-to-day written record of the exploration of areas of Cape Cod and Plymouth bay and harbour. The \\"Relation\\" is the single most important historical document of its kind in early American history.Robert E. Cushman and Franklin P.

It had been certified by the signatures of the leadership now led by Governor Bradford, successor to John Carver. This document had renewed the relationship between the colonist and the London investors and the investors were also relieved of ingratitude and culpable impropriety.Robert E. Cushman and Franklin P. Cole, Robert Cushman of Kent (1577‚Äì1625) : Chief Agent of the Plymouth Pilgrims (1617‚Äì1625)(General Society of Mayflower Descendants: 2005), 2nd Ed. edited by Judith Swan p. 73 Cushman served as agent of the New Plymouth Colony and representative of the colony with the company of Merchant Adventurers of London until he died in May of 1625. Cushman did not die in London of the plague in 1625. There are no primary sources as evidence for this claim. Robert was visiting Benenden, Kent, the next door village to Rolvenden, where his brother, Richard, lived until Richard died in March 1623/24. Richard Couchman left a will probated in 1624 (PRC/17/65/443, Benenden). The will left a bequest to the children of \\"brother in lawe Stephen Everenden\\" (also Evernden). He married Richard and Roberts' sister, Sylvester Coucheman, in Rolvenden on 7 Nov 1593. Michael R. Paulick and Robert C. Cushman, \\"The 1625 Death of Pilgrim Robert Cushman in Benenden, Kent\\", The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol 172, Winter 2018, 25-29 Robert Cushman intended to sail to Plymouth Colony and was visiting his relatives before he left. William Bradford, in his book Of Plymouth Plantation, wrote that Cushman's \\"own purpose was to come over and spend his [last] days with them\\". The St. Georges, Benenden archdeacon's transcript, primary source, record was May 6, 1625 \\"The 6 day Roberte Couchman a stranger.\\" It was usual to identify a person as a \\"stranger\\" if they were from another parish. Robert lived in St. Botolph without Aldgate parish in northeast London. William Bradford, Governor of Plymouth for many years, wrote upon receiving notice of Robert Cushman's death in England, that he \\"was as their right hand with their friends the (Merchant) Adventurers (London investment group), and for divers (sic) years had done and agitated all their business with them, to their great advantage.\\"  Family  Robert Cushman's first marriage, in the parish of St Alphege, Canterbury, 11 July 1606, was to Sara Reder, who lived in the precincts of the cathedral and whose parentage has not been discovered. Sara Cushman died in Leiden, Holland, and was buried on 11 October 1616. Two of her three children died that year also. The children of Robert Cushman and his wife Sara: 1\\\\. Thomas Cushman (ca.1607/08-1691) was baptised at St Andrew's church, Canterbury. He died in Plymouth, Massachusetts, 11 December 1691. He married Mary Allerton, daughter of Isaac Allerton about 1636 in Plymouth. They had eight children. Mary died in Plymouth 28 November 1699, the last of the Mayflower passengers. Thomas Cushman at age fourteen, was left behind at New Plymouth in the charge of the governor, William Bradford, after his father, Robert, returned to England. Thomas Cushman became Ruling Elder of the Plymouth Church in 1649, and remained in that office forty-two years until his death in 1691. 2\\\\.

In 1617 Robert Cushman married secondly, Mary Clarke Shingleton in Leiden, widow of Thomas Shingleton, who had died there. Cushman was forty and Mary twenty-seven. Prior to 1610, before sailing for Leiden, the Shingeltons had also moved from Canterbury where they lived, to St. Peter's parish, Sandwich, Kent. They later joined the Pilgrim Church in Leiden.Robert Cushman, Mayflower Pilgrim in Canterbury, 1596‚Äì1607, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 79, no. 3, September 2013 p. 230  Cushman Monument on Burial Hill in Plymouth  Robert Cushman was buried in England in 1625. On 15 August 1855 a gathering of Cushman family members meeting on Burial Hill in Plymouth Massachusetts decided to erect a monument to him and his descendants. The family formed the Cushman Monument Association. with any person contributing to the Association receiving a certificate stating the amount contributed and a picture of the Monument. During the erection of the twenty-five-foot monument, the remains of Robert Cushman's son Elder Thomas Cushman, his wife Mary (Allerton) and other family members were found. These remains would later be buried within a space constructed beneath the monument, the completion of which was celebrated on 16 September 1858.150th Anniversary of Cushman Monument on Burial Hill, The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 75, no. 1, March 2009. p. 48Robert E.

It is located within the Pyrenees Shire. History=1850 - 1880 First settled in 1853 after a rush to a rich claim nearby, the town reached the height of its prosperity in the 1880s. But Homebush owed its existence entirely to the mines: when the gold ran out and the mines closed the town rapidly declined and died. All that remains of a once-flourishing community is a school building and some mullock heaps. Planned development began in June 1860 when, following a second rush to the diggings, Homebush was surveyed and its streets laid out. Homebush Post Office opened on 1 October 1863 (closing in 1944). Some miners and their families maintained a degree of elegance despite the challenging conditions. An Office of Lands and Survey map shows the Township of Homebush ( Coordinates ) as it was in January 1863. The map shows, the land subdivisions, some buildings and the location of the Star Hotel and the Wesleyan Chapel. Three churches were built, and within little more than a decade. The town opened its railway station, homebush railway station. By 1884 Homebush was firmly established as a business centre, with two agents, a bootmaker, a butcher, two carpenters, two contractors, nine farmers, a gardener, a registrar, a station master, a storekeeper, and a teacher. Lower Homebush, three miles away, where the commercial life of the town had moved closer to some deep-lead mines, had a blacksmith, two bootmakers, a carpenter, a draper, an engineer, two farmers, three hotels, two mining managers, and twelve stores. left The Methodist Church / Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1872. As the town declined, in 1928 the church was dismantled and moved 6 km to Rathscar West. 1880 - 1930 In 1883 Vale's Reef mine, one of the district's largest, closed for lack of capital, and over the next decade many other companies also ceased operations. In 1889 hopes revived when the Madame Hopkins Company was formed with a large investment of capital to work an untried deep-lead to the east of Homebush, but this new company was not successful. left In 1909 the Excelsior Company opened in Homebush and reputedly yielded rich returns from relatively small quantities of quartz, but by 1920 all large-scale gold mining activity in Avoca shire had ended. The combined population of Homebush and Homebush Lower had fallen to only 150, a huge decline from its peak of 14,000 during the rushes. Businesses closed and buildings were dismantled. Schools The rise and decline of Homebush and Lower Homebush can be seen in the history of its schools. In 1861 a Church of England school opened, with classes held in a rented building. Over the next two decades the number of students increased to more than two hundred and two more schools were built, one at Homebush, with another, even bigger, at Lower Homebush - the Lower Homebush Primary School. ( Coordinates ) But by 1903 the average attendance at the Lower Homebush school was only forty. Gold yields had dropped and mining companies had ceased operating. Homebush School closed permanently in 1908. Lower Homebush School had small enrolments from the 1930s, and by 1967 it too had closed. By then the Homebush School had long gone. The Pyrenees Shire Council has documented the history of the Lower Homebush Primary School, in the Avoca Heritage Study: 1864 - 1994 - Volume 3.

As approved by the United States Congress, the act required a stronger health warning on cigarette packages, saying \\"Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined that Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health\\". It also banned cigarette advertisements on American radio and television. Origins The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was one of the major bills resulting from the 1964 report by the Surgeon General, Luther Terry. The report found that lung cancer and chronic bronchitis are causally related to cigarette smoking. Congress previously passed the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in 1965; requiring that all cigarette packages sold in the United States carry a health warning. But after a recommendation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act amended the 1965 law so that the warnings are made in the name of the Surgeon General. One of the major advocates of the cigarette advertising ban was the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC argued that since the topic of smoking is controversial, numerous TV and radio stations continued to break the Fairness Doctrine when airing these commercials because they did not give equal time to the opposing viewpoint that smoking is dangerous. The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was introduced into Congress in 1969, but it was not until April 1, 1970, when U.S. President Richard Nixon signed it into law. The actual cigarette advertising ban did not come into force until January 2, 1971, as per a compromise that allowed broadcasters to air these commercials during their telecasts of college football bowl games on New Year's Day. The last cigarette ad on U.S. television, advertising Virginia Slims, was carried on the last possible legal minute at 11:59 p.m ET/PT, 10:59 p.m. CT/MT that evening on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Effects In 1981, the FTC reported that the health warning labels as mandated by the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act had little effect on American smoking habits. Congress therefore passed the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984, requiring more specific health warnings. The tobacco industry has begun to use a variety of other marketing tools and strategies to influence people and attract new customers. In particular, ads targeted to adolescents affect their perceptions on the image and function of smoking. In 1991, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study showing that more children aged 5 and 6 years old, could recognize Camel cigarettes' Joe Camel mascot than Mickey Mouse or Fred Flintstone. Camel increased its adolescent customer base dramatically, from less than 1% before 1988 to more than 13% in 1993. Tobacco sought protection from Congress so they could all leave broadcasting together without violating any anti-trust laws. The only lawsuit that followed was from a broadcaster in an effort to keep tobacco advertising on television and radio. The law also affected advertising revenues on television and radio stations, along with the current imposition of Financial Interest and Syndication Rules and the Prime Time Access Rule, which also both took effect in 1971. NBC responded by pushing its broadcast day later into the overnight, adding shows such as The Midnight Special and Snyder's Tomorrow to open up further advertising inventory.Tom Snyder on Later, 1994 References Category:1970 in law Category:United States federal health legislation Category:Tobacco advertising Category:Smoking in the United States Category:1970 in the United States Category:Advertising in the United States Category:Advertising regulation Category:Regulation in the United States ","title":"Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act"},{"id":"1499165","text":"In graph theory, a vertex subset S \\\\subset V is a vertex separator (or vertex cut, separating set) for nonadjacent vertices a and b if the removal of S from the graph separates a and b into distinct connected components. Examples A separator for a grid graph. Consider a grid graph with r rows and c columns; the total number n of vertices is r*c. For instance, in the illustration, r = 5, c = 8, and n = 40\\\\. If r is odd, there is a single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if c is odd, there is a single central column, and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing S to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing S from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs A and B, each of which has at most n/2 vertices. If r ‚â§ c (as in the illustration), then choosing a central column will give a separator S with r ‚â§ ‚àön vertices, and similarly if c ‚â§ r then choosing a central row will give a separator with at most ‚àön vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator S of size at most ‚àön, the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most n/2.. Instead of using a row or column of a grid graph, George partitions the graph into four pieces by using the union of a row and a column as a separator. rightframeOn the left a centered tree, on the right a bicentered one. The numbers show each node's eccentricity. To give another class of examples, every free tree T has a separator S consisting of a single vertex, the removal of which partitions T into two or more connected components, each of size at most n/2. More precisely, there is always exactly one or exactly two vertices, which amount to such a separator, depending on whether the tree is centered or bicentered. As opposed to these examples, not all vertex separators are balanced, but that property is most useful for applications in computer science, such as the planar separator theorem. Minimal separators Let S be an (a,b)-separator, that is, a vertex subset that separates two nonadjacent vertices a and b. Then S is a minimal (a,b)-separator if no proper subset of S separates a and b. More generally, S is called a minimal separator if it is a minimal separator for some pair (a,b) of nonadjacent vertices. Notice that this is different from minimal separating set which says that no proper subset of S is a minimal (u,v)-separator for any pair of vertices (u,v). The following is a well-known result characterizing the minimal separators:. Lemma. A vertex separator S in G is minimal if and only if the graph G-S, obtained by removing S from G, has two connected components C_1 and C_2 such that each vertex in S is both adjacent to some vertex in C_1 and to some vertex in C_2. The minimal \\"(a,b)\\"-separators also form an algebraic structure: For two fixed vertices a and b of a given graph G, an (a,b)-separator S can be regarded as a predecessor of another (a,b)-separator T, if every path from a to b meets S before it meets T. More rigorously, the predecessor relation is defined as follows: Let S and T be two (a,b)-separators in 'G'. Then S is a predecessor of T, in symbols S \\\\sqsubseteq_{a,b}^G T, if for each x \\\\in S \\\\setminus T, every path connecting x to b meets T. It follows from the definition that the predecessor relation yields a preorder on the set of all (a,b)-separators. Furthermore, proved that the predecessor relation gives rise to a complete lattice when restricted to the set of minimal (a,b)-separators in G.

They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but many consider themselves Arab. They claim that they descend from the Beni Hassan, an Arab tribe, who invaded the Western Saharan desert in the 14th century. The Sahrawis are Muslims of the Sunni sect and the Maliki law school. Their interpretation of Islam has traditionally being quite liberal and adapted to nomad life (i.e. generally functioning without mosques). The clan- and tribe-based society underwent a massive social upheaval in 1975, when a large portion of the population fled fighting in the country and settled in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, breaking up families and clans. The Polisario Front, which runs the camps, has attempted to modernize their society, placing a public emphasis on education, the eradication of tribalism and the emancipation of women. The role of women in camps was enhanced by their shouldering of the main responsibility for the camps and government bureaucracy during the war years, as virtually the entire male population was enrolled in the Polisario army. Education was also assisted by refugee life. While teaching materials are still scarce, the \\"urbanization\\" of the refugee camps and the abundance of free time for camp dwellers (after the situation normalized circa 1977) greatly increased the effectiveness of literacy classes. The Polisario Front claims presently that nearly 90% of refugees are literate, the number having been less than 10% in 1975, and several thousands have received university education in foreign countries as part of aid packages (mainly Algeria, Cuba, and Spain). The Moroccan government considerably invested in the social and economic development of Western Sahara with special emphasis on education, modernisation and infrastructure. El Aai√∫n in particular has been the target of heavy government investment, and has grown rapidly. Several thousands Sahrawis study in Moroccan universities. Literacy rates are estimated at some 50% of the population. To date, there have been few thorough studies of the culture due in part to the political situation. Some language and culture studies, mainly by French researchers, have been performed on Sahrawi communities in northern Mauritania.

Before marriage, girls intentionally overeat and perform limited physical activity for 40 days in order to be attractive for their soon-to-be husbands.

The company has offices in 20 countries, including Canada, the United States, Norway, Scotland, India, Brazil, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2019, Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 26% of the company's revenues, while Equinor accounted for 21% of the company's revenues, and Chevron accounted for 17% of the company's revenues.http://investor.deepwater.com/static- files/f51fd3e3-525d-47d6-90d1-bce780a1285c History Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies. In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. William C. O'Malley, an executive at Sonat's headquarters in Birmingham, was named the company's first Chief Executive Officer in 1992. In 1993, Sonat spun off the majority of its ownership in the company. Sonat sold its remaining 40% stake in the company during a secondary public offering in late 1995. In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was . The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships. In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean. Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations P√©troli√®res (Forex) founded in 1942 in German-occupied France for drilling in North Africa. Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B; Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B; Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. R&B; Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of . In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay US$13,440,000 to settle the matter. In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate. In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a well, the deepest well in history ‚Äì more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification. In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP. In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway. In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high- specification deepwater rigs. In 2013, the company was added to the S&P; 500 index. In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss. Effective on 30 March 2016, the company delisted its shares from the SIX Swiss Exchange, at which time its shares were removed from the Swiss Market Index. Effective on January 30, 2018, the company completed its acquisition of Songa Offshore.http://www.deepwater.com/news/detail?ID=2329262 In December 2018, the company acquired Ocean Rig. Controversies=Accidents and incidents Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's 2007 merger with GlobalSantaFe, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in \\"job quality\\" and \\"overall satisfaction.\\" In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for \\"job quality\\" and next to last in \\"overall satisfaction.\\" In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record. The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. \\"Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects,\\" said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank. =Transocean Leader accident (2002)= On 2 March 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland. =Galveston Bay explosion (2003)= On 17 June 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas. =Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)= On 24 August 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its \\"remote blowout preventor control panel ‚Ä¶ in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair.\\" On 21 November 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter. =Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)= On 12 April 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission's report found a series of \\"unfortunate circumstances\\" led to the accident \\"with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean.\\" =2008 fatalities= In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels. =Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)= On 20 April 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC‚àí5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew. Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank. As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day ‚Äì for 87 days. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on 29 April, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on 28 April that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig. Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million. During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a \\"heated argument\\" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well. On 14 May 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, \\"I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle‚Ä¶ executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't.\\" Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was \\"the best year in safety performance in our company‚Äôs history\\". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate.\\" They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses. In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families. =Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)= The offshore drilling facility \\"Sedco 706\\", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the \\"Frade\\" oil field. Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability. =Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)= In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore. The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions. Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch R√≤g. Environmental record In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.

Life As a young man, McGrath was a member of the Responsible Government League which opposed Newfoundland becoming a province of Canada. Nevertheless, upon the dominion's joining confederation in 1949, McGrath left to enlist with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He returned to Newfoundland in 1953 and became sales manager with radio station CJON. In 1955, he became secretary of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party association. In 1956, he ran unsuccessfully for the party in the provincial election. Federal politics He entered federal politics the next year, and won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1957 election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for St. John's East. In 1962, McGrath became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys, and served in that position until he was defeated along with the Diefenbaker government in the 1963 election. McGrath regained his seat in the 1968 election, and remained in parliament through five subsequent elections. When the Progressive Conservatives formed the government following the 1979 election, Prime Minister Joe Clark advised the Governor General to appoint McGrath Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. McGrath returned to the opposition bench when Clark's minority government was defeated in the 1980 election. McGrath was not included in the Cabinet when the Tories returned to power in the 1984 election under Brian Mulroney. Instead, McGrath was appointed chairman of the Special Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons. The report he authored led to a number of procedural changes, including the introduction of election by secret ballot for the position of Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons.

R√≠o de Oro (Spanish for \\"Gold River\\"; , wƒÅdƒ´-a√∞-√∞ahab, often transliterated as Oued Edhahab) was, with Saguia el-Hamra, one of the two territories that formed the Spanish province of Spanish Sahara after 1969; it had been taken as a Spanish colonial possession in the late 19th century. Its name seems to come from an east‚Äìwest river which was supposed to have run through it. The river was thought to have largely dried out ‚Äì a wadi, as the name indicates ‚Äì or have disappeared underground. The Spanish name is derived from its previous name Rio do Ouro, given to it by its Portuguese discoverer Afonso Gon√ßalves Baldaia in 1436. The Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator dispatched a mission in 1435, under Gil Eanes and Baldaia, to find the legendary River of Gold in western Africa. Going down the coast, they rounded the al-Dakhla peninsula in present-day Western Sahara and emerged into an inlet, which they excitedly believed to be the mouth of the River of Gold (see Senegal River). The name continued to be used for the inlet and the surrounding area although no gold was found there, neither in the water of the narrow gulf, probably mistaken for the river itself, nor in its neighborhood. Occupying the southern part of Western Sahara, the territory lies between 26¬∞ to the north and 21¬∞ 20' to the south. The area is roughly , making it approximately two thirds of the entire Western Sahara. The former provincial capital founded by the Spanish was Villa Cisneros, which was renamed under Moroccan administration in 1976 \\"ad-Dakhla\\". The Battle of R√≠o de Oro was a single-ship action fought in August 1914 during the First World War. A British protected cruiser attacked a German auxiliary cruiser off the small Spanish colony of R√≠o de Oro. In 1975, as Spain retreated from the territory, Western Sahara was split under the Madrid Accords between Mauritania and Morocco, even if this division was bitterly contested by the Polisario Front. The dividing line ran halfway through R√≠o de Oro, with Morocco taking the northern part plus Saguia el-Hamra, and Mauritania annexing the lower third of the colony as a northern province called Tiris al-Gharbiyya (Western Tiris). Its provincial capital was already called Dakhla. After a disastrous four-year war with the Polisario, Mauritania relinquished Tiris al-Gharbiyya, withdrew from Western Sahara, and left Morocco and the Polisario as the sole belligerents in the conflict, which is not yet resolved; a cease-fire has been in effect since 1991. This area is today divided by the Moroccan military berm, with Morocco occupying the parts to the west of it, and the Polisario Front-held Free Zone, under the control of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to the east. These zones are temporary divisions negotiated as a part of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) ceasefire.Military Agreement No. 1 References Category:Geography of Western Sahara Category:Former Spanish colonies Category:States and territories established in 1969 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1975 Category:Spanish words and phrases Category:Spanish Sahara ","title":"R√≠o de Oro"},{"id":"1499214","text":"Kenting National Park (), commonly known as Kenting (), is a national park located on the Hengchun Peninsula of Pingtung County, Taiwan, covering Hengchun, Checheng, and Manzhou Townships.

It is owned by Sound Publishing, Inc. The paper serves as a major news source for residents of Snohomish County. History Newsboys for the Everett Daily Herald, The Daily Herald was first published on February 11, 1901, by S. A. Perkins and S. E. Wharton. An earlier newspaper known as the Herald had been established in 1891 and ceased publication during the Panic of 1893. The second incarnation of the Herald, originally named the Everett Independent, was sold to James B. Best in 1905. The newspaper established a satellite news bureau for southern Snohomish County in May 1954, which later became the Western Sun edition in 1970. The Best family owned the newspaper until it was sold in 1978 to the Washington Post Company. The Daily Herald's website, HeraldNet.com, was launched on January 5, 1997. For years, The Daily Herald was an afternoon paper. It is now a morning paper. The newspaper also acquired a chain of weekly newspapers under The Enterprise in southern Snohomish County, which it operated from 1996 to 2012. On February 6, 2013, the Washington Post Company announced it was selling the paper to the Sound Publishing division, based in Everett, Washington, of Black Press, based in Victoria, British Columbia. Notable court cases In March 1983, The Daily Herald lost an appellate court case in the State of Washington in which it sought to quash a subpoena allowing a judicial review of confidential material gathered for articles it had published in 1979 on the cult activities of Theodore Rinaldo, who had since been convicted on charges of rape, indecent liberties and assault. The New York Times reported that the court had ruled that \\"criminal defendants could force reporters to reveal confidential sources if the information was crucial to the case\\" and characterized the loss as \\"a major defeat for the news media\\". The Daily Herald took the Appeals Court decision to the Washington Supreme Court in State v. Rinaldo 102 Wn.2d 749 (1984), which was heard en banc with the result that the subpoena itself was quashed on the basis that Rinaldo had not met the threshold requirements to compel such an inspection, while upholding the Court of Appeals ruling in general.

She is best known for her series of best-selling books that challenge the dominant free-market economic ideology of recent decades. Her books make the case for a more egalitarian distribution of power, income and wealth. The National Post newspaper has described McQuaig as \\"Canada's Michael Moore\\". In October 2016, one of McQuaig's books, Shooting the Hippo: Death by Deficit and other Canadian Myths, was named by the Literary Review of Canada as one of the 25 most influential Canadian books of the past 25 years. Early years and personal life McQuaig was born in September 1951 to a middle-class Toronto family that she has described as opinionated and interested in politics. Her father Jack, who she has called \\"politically conservative but with a strong sense of social justice\\", is founder of the McQuaig Institute of Executive Development and has written a half-dozen books on leadership and personal development. McQuaig's mother Audrey was also trained as a psychologist, but gave up her career to raise McQuaig, her sister Wendy and brothers Peter, Don and John. From the ages of seven to nine, McQuaig wrote and published the one-page DeVere Weekly, a newspaper named after the street in Toronto on which her family lived. From 1963 to 1970 McQuaig attended Branksome Hall, a Toronto private girls school where she became president of the debating society and twice led her school to victory at the Ridley invitational debating tournament, and from which she graduated with the Governor General's medal for academic achievement. Later she attended the University of Toronto, where she worked for the student newspaper The Varsity and served as co-editor in chief with Thomas Walkom. McQuaig graduated the University of Toronto in 1974 with a BA, specializing in History and Political Theory. In the 1970s McQuaig and four friends co-owned a house they called The Pit in Toronto's east end, where they hosted frequent house parties and dinners for friends in academia, media and the arts. In 1976 she lived for a year in Paris, where she learned French and wrote a never-published novel. In the mid-eighties McQuaig and two female friends created The Make-Out Game, a boardgame she has described as \\"a satire on the different ways men and women approach sex.\\" In the early nineties she married criminal defence lawyer Fred Fedorsen, with whom she has a daughter, Amy. The marriage ended in 1994. Career McQuaig first worked as a journalist while a student at University of Toronto, initially writing and then co-editing, The Varsity, a year in each role. In 1974 she was hired as a full-time reporter by The Globe and Mail newspaper. In 1977 she became a story producer for CBC Radio's As It Happens. In 1979 she went to Tehran to freelance for the CBC, The Globe and Mail and Maclean's magazine, covering the aftermath of the Iranian revolution that overthrew the Shah. In 1981 she joined Maclean's as a senior writer, and in 1982 took a leave of absence to cover the 1982 Lebanon War from Lebanon, Israel and the West Bank. In 1983 McQuaig wrote a two-part piece for Maclean's with its then-assistant business editor Ian Austen investigating whether Canadian financier Conrad Black had tried to inappropriately influence the Attorney General of Ontario to stop an investigation into his attempted takeover of Ohio-based Hanna Mining Company. Years later, Black described McQuaig in his Toronto Sun column as a \\"weedy and not very bright leftist reporter\\" who writes \\"sophomoric, soporiferous left-wing books\\", and told host Peter Gzowski on CBC Radio that McQuaig deserved to be \\"horsewhipped\\". Later McQuaig was retained as a freelance columnist for Black's National Post newspaper. In 1984, McQuaig returned to the Globe as a political reporter, where she first came to national prominence in 1989 for uncovering the Patti Starr affair, in which former Ontario Place CEO Patti Starr was found to have illegally used charitable funds to make political donations, and for which McQuaig was awarded a National Newspaper Award. In 1991, she was awarded an Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy to study the social welfare systems in Europe and North America. This resulted in the Atkinson Foundation publishing, in 1992, a 51-page special report by McQuaig called Canada's Social Programs: Under Attack. Since 1992 McQuaig has written an op-ed column in the Toronto Star and has supported herself through a combination of freelance writing, speaking engagements and royalties from her books. Federal politics On 6 August 2013, McQuaig announced that she would seek the nomination of the New Democratic Party to run in the pending Toronto Centre by-election. On 15 September she won the nomination on the first ballot. The election to replace Bob Rae was won by Liberal Chrystia Freeland. McQuaig ran again in the 2015 federal election losing to Liberal Bill Morneau. During that campaign, she was denounced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper after she stated on a CBC-TV program that much of the oil from the Athabasca oil sands would have to be left in the ground if Canada was to meet its climate change targets. Themes McQuaig is best known for her series of books and newspaper columns that describe how the corporate elite has managed to shape government economic and social policy in ways that have harmed the public interest. Her first book, Behind Closed Doors (1987), relates the history of the fight over tax policy in Canada, detailing how members of the financial elite have effectively maintained and extended control over the country‚Äôs tax policy, to their own benefit. The Quick and the Dead (1991) relates the story behind the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States, and its negative impact on Canada. Her best-selling 1993 book The Wealthy Banker's Wife compared the social welfare systems of Europe with those of the United States, and showed how Canada, traditionally in the middle between the two extremes, was increasingly veering towards the US model. Her 1995 book, Shooting the Hippo, topped The Globe and Mail national best-seller list for more than two months. It argued that politicians and the business community had misled the Canadian public with claims that rising social spending was driving up the national deficit, thereby requiring the government to slash social spending. The book disputed the seriousness of the deficit and argued that the deficit's prime cause was the Bank of Canada‚Äôs radical anti-inflation policy, which had dramatically pushed up interest rates and driven the country into recession.\\" The Cult of Impotence (1998) disputed the notion that countries had no alternative but to submit to corporate demands for deep tax cuts and reduced social spending‚Äîor wealth-holders would move their capital offshore. She noted that, in the postwar era, countries had created international financial rules that prevented excessive capital mobility, and that such restraints were still possible in the modern global economy. What had changed wasn‚Äôt so much the technology but the political insistence of corporate interests on getting their way. In All You Can Eat (2001), McQuaig looked at how the new international financial rules and trade deals were ensconcing a radical form of capitalism, leading to deep inequality and the disempowerment of the people. Drawing on the work of economic historian and anthropologist Karl Polanyi, McQuaig described how the new capitalism was not part of a natural evolution but rather a deliberately imposed redesign of society at odds with the basic human need for community. It's The Crude, Dude: War, Big Oil and the Fight for the Planet (2004) looked at how the quest for oil has long shaped US foreign policy, culminating in George W Bush‚Äôs invasion of Iraq, even as global warming was making it imperative for the world to curb oil consumption. It's the Crude, Dude: Greed, Gas, War and the American Way (2006) is a version of McQuaig's 2004 book with added information relating to the U.S. In Holding the Bully's Coat: Canada and the US Empire (2007), McQuaig argues that Canada should stop supporting the US in its role as an imperial power. In The Trouble with Billionaires (2010), McQuaig and co-author Neil Brooks, a professor of tax policy at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, examined the rise of the billionaire class and its negative impact on society, and argued for a much more progressive tax system. Billionaires' Ball: Gluttony and Hubris in an Age of Epic Inequality (2012) is a version of The Trouble with Billionaires with an emphasis on economic policies in the U.S. McQuaig's newspaper columns focus on issues like the importance of maintaining a strong social safety net, and on the detrimental effects of privatization, trade and globalization, and the influence of money in politics.

Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school is the recognized religious tradition of Tajikistan since 2009. According to a 2009 U.S. State Department release, the population of Tajikistan is 98% Muslim, (approximately 95% Sunni and 3% Shia), with some Sufi orders.  Demographics and early history  Islam, the predominant religion of all of Central Asia, was brought to the region by the Arabs in the seventh century. Since that time, Islam has become an integral part of Tajik culture. For instance, the Samanid state became a staunch patron of Islamic architecture and spread the Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. Also, Ismail Samani, who is considered the father of the Tajik nation, promoted Muslim missionary efforts around the region. The population within Central Asia began firmly accepting Islam in significant numbers, notably in Taraz, now in modern-day Kazakhstan. During the Soviet era, efforts to secularize society were largely unsuccessful and the post- Soviet era has seen a marked increase in religious practice. The number of Muslims who fast during the holy month of Ramadan is high; up to 99% of Muslims in the countryside and 70% in the cities fasted during the latest month of Ramadan (2004). Most Shia Muslims, particularly the Ismaili reside in the remote Gorno-Badakhshan region as well as certain districts of the southern Khatlon region and in Dushanbe. Among other religions, the Russian Orthodox faith is practiced only by the Russians living therein although the Russian community shrank significantly in the early 1990s. Some other small Christian groups now enjoy relative freedom of worship. There also is a very tiny Jewish community. Shi'a Islam The Sunni branch of Islam has a 1,200-year-old tradition among the sedentary population of Central Asia, including the Tajiks. A minority group, the Pamiris, are members of a much smaller denomination of Shia Islam, Nizari Ismailism, which first won adherents in Central Asia in the early tenth century. Despite persecution, Ismailism has survived in the remote Pamir Mountains and they are followers of the Aga Khan.  Soviet era  The traditional veil in Tajikistan worn before modern times was the faranji but during the Hujum, the Soviet Communists gave women civil rights equal to men, and prohibited the wearing of \\"oppressive clothing\\" like veils. During the course of seven decades of political control, Soviet policy makers were unable to eradicate the Islamic tradition. The harshest of the Soviet anti-Islamic campaigns occurred from the late 1920s to the late 1930s as part of a unionwide drive against religion in general. In this period, many Muslim functionaries were killed, and religious instruction and observance were curtailed sharply. After the German attack of the Soviet Union in 1941, official policy toward Islam moderated. One of the changes that ensued was the establishment in 1943 of an officially sanctioned Islamic hierarchy for Central Asia, the Muslim Board of Central Asia. Together with three similar organizations for other regions of the Soviet Union having large Muslim populations, this administration was controlled by the Kremlin, which required loyalty from religious officials. Although its administrative personnel and structure were inadequate to serve the needs of the Muslim population of the region, the administration made possible the legal existence of some Islamic institutions, as well as the activities of religious functionaries, a small number of mosques, and religious instruction at two seminaries in Uzbekistan. In the early 1960s, Nikita Khrushchev's regime escalated anti-Islamic propaganda. Then, on several occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, the Kremlin leadership called for renewed efforts to combat religion, including Islam. Typically, such campaigns included conversion of mosques to secular use; attempts to reidentify traditional Islamic-linked customs with nationalism rather than religion; and propaganda linking Islam to backwardness, superstition, and bigotry. Official hostility toward Islam grew in 1979 with Soviet military involvement in nearby Afghanistan and the increasing assertiveness of Islamic revivalists in several countries. From that time through the early post-Soviet era, some officials in Moscow and in Tajikistan warned of an extremist Islamic menace, often on the basis of limited or distorted evidence. Despite all these efforts, Islam remained an important part of the identity of the Tajiks and other Muslim peoples of Tajikistan through the end of the Soviet era and the first years of independence.  Since independence  A mosque in Isfara Identification with Islam as an integral part of life is shared by urban and rural, old and young, and educated and uneducated Tajiks. The role that the faith plays in the lives of individuals varies considerably, however. For some Tajiks, Islam is more important as an intrinsic part of their cultural heritage than as a religion in the usual sense, and a few Tajiks are not religious. In any case, Tajiks have disproved the standard Soviet assertion that the urbanized industrial labor force and the educated population had little to do with a \\"remnant of a bygone era\\" such as Islam. A noteworthy development in the late Soviet and early independence eras was increased interest, especially among young people, in the substance of Islamic doctrine. In the post-Soviet era, Islam became an important element in the nationalist arguments of certain Tajik intellectuals. Islam continued in Tajikistan in widely varied forms because of the strength of an indigenous folk Islam quite apart from the Soviet-sanctioned Islamic administration. Long before the Soviet era, rural Central Asians, including inhabitants of what became Tajikistan, had access to their own holy places. There were also small, local religious schools and individuals within their communities who were venerated for religious knowledge and piety. These elements sustained religion in the countryside, independent of outside events. Under Soviet regimes, Tajiks used the substantial remainder of this rural, popular Islam to continue at least some aspects of the teaching and practice of their faith after the activities of urban-based Islamic institutions were curtailed. Folk Islam also played an important role in the survival of Islam among the urban population. One form of this popular Islam is Sufism‚Äîoften described as Islamic mysticism and practiced by individuals in a variety of ways. The most important form of Sufism in Tajikistan is the Naqshbandiyya, a Sufi order with followers as far away as India and Malaysia. Besides Sufism, other forms of popular Islam are associated with local cults and holy places or with individuals whose knowledge or personal qualities have made them influential. By late 1989, the Mikhail Gorbachev regime's increased tolerance of religion began to affect the practices of Islam and Russian Orthodoxy. Religious instruction increased. New mosques opened. Religious observance became more open, and participation increased. New Islamic spokesmen emerged in Tajikistan and elsewhere in Central Asia. The authority of the official, Tashkent-based Muslim Board of Central Asia crumbled in Tajikistan. Tajikistan acquired its own seminary in Dushanbe, ending its reliance on the administration's two seminaries in Uzbekistan. By 1990 the Muslim Board's chief official in Dushanbe, the senior qadi, Hajji Akbar Turajonzoda (in office 1988-92), had become an independent public figure with a broad following. In the factional political battle that followed independence, Turajonzoda criticized the communist hard-liners and supported political reform and official recognition of the importance of Islam in Tajikistani society. At the same time, he repeatedly denied hard-liners' accusations that he sought the establishment of an Islamic government in Tajikistan. After the hard-liners' victory in the civil war at the end of 1992, Turajonzoda fled Dushanbe and was charged with treason. Ironically, however, after 1997 powershare between current administration and the former opposition groups, Turajonzoda has been appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister of Tajikistan, and unequivocally supports Emomalii Rahmon's regime. Muslims in Tajikistan also organized politically in the early 1990s. In 1990, as citizens in many parts of the Soviet Union were forming their own civic organizations, Muslims from various parts of the union organized the Islamic Rebirth Party. By the early 1990s, the growth of mass political involvement among Central Asian Muslims led all political parties‚Äîincluding the Communist Party of Tajikistan‚Äîto take into account the Muslim heritage of the vast majority of Tajikistan's inhabitants. Islam also played a key political role for the regime in power in the early 1990s. The communist old guard evoked domestic and international fears that fundamentalist Muslims would destabilize the Tajikistani government when that message was expedient in fortifying the hard-liners' position against opposition forces in the civil war. However, the Nabiyev regime also was willing to represent itself as an ally of Iran's Islamic republic while depicting the Tajik opposition as unfaithful Muslims.  Recent developments  A madrassa in Istarawshan. In October 2005, Tajikistan's Ministry of Education banned female students from wearing Islamic headscarves in secular schools. Wearing the hijab, or head scarf traditionally worn by Muslim women, and other religious symbols \\"is unacceptable in secular schools and violates the constitution and a new law on education,\\" Education Minister Abdudjabor Rahmonov said. He expressed concern that pupils spent too much time in mosques at the expense of their education. \\"Many spend evenings in mosques and do not do their homework,\\" Rahmonov said, adding that during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan many did not attend classes after Friday prayers. More recently, according to an unconfirmed report, the Tajik government has closed hundreds of unregistered Mosques drawing locals to believe that the crackdown is actually against the religion of Islam. According to reports, some Mosques have been destroyed while others have been converted into beauty parlors. Some have speculated that the crackdown is a result of governmental concerns of Mosques being \\"unsafe,\\" or that the Imams may not act \\"responsible.\\" Tajikistan marked 2009 as the year to commemorate the Sunni Muslim jurist Abu Hanifa, as the nation hosted an international symposium that drew scientific and religious leaders. The construction of one of the largest mosques in the world, funded by Qatar, was announced in October 2009. The mosque is planned to be built in Dushanbe and construction is said to be completed by 2014. In 2010, Tajikistan hosted a session of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference with delegations from 56 members states gathering at Dushanbe. Mosques are not permitted to allow women in, only state controlled religious education is approved for children and long beards are banned in Tajikistan.https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022955/http://www.stripes.com/news/middle- east/kerry-urges-tajikistan-not-to-go-overboard-in-its-crackdown-on- islam-1.376730 In Tajikistan, Mosques are banned from allowing Friday Prayers for younger than 18 year old children. The government has shut down Mosques and forbids foreign religious education. From the beginning of 2011 1,500 Mosques were shut down by the Tajik government, in addition to banning the hijab for children, banning the use of loudspeakers for the call of prayer, forbidding mosques from allowing women to enter, and monitoring Imams and students learning an Islamic education abroad, having sermons in the Mosque approved by the government and limiting the Mosque sermons to 15 minutes. Muslims experienced the most negative effects from the \\"Religion Law\\" enacted by the government of Tajikistan, curtailing sermons by Imams during weddings, making the \\"Cathedral mosques\\" the only legal place for sermons to be given by Imams with sermons not being allowed in five-fold mosques, the five-fold mosques are small mosques and serve a limited number of people while the medium and big mosques are categorized as Cathedral mosques, girls who wore the hijab have been expelled from schools and hijabs and beards are not permitted on passport photos. Mosques have been demolished and shut down by the Tajikistan government on the excuses that they were not registered and therefore not considered as mosques by the government. Tajikistan has targeted religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Christians, and Muslims who try to evade control by the government, synagogue, churches, and Mosques have been shut down and destroyed, only a certain amount of mosques are allowed to operate and the state must approve all \\"religious activity\\", in which younger than 18 year old children are not allowed to join in. Buildings for religious worhsip for Jehovah's Witnesses, Protestant Churches, the Jewish Synagogue, and Muslim mosques have been targeted, destroyed, and shut down and prayers are forbidden to take place in public halls, with severe restrictions placed on religion. Tajikistan forced religious communities to re-register with the government and shut Mosques and Churches down which refused re-registration in 2009. Churches, a synagogue, and mosques have been destroyed by the Tajikistan government. Government approval is required for Tajiks seeking to engage in religious studies in foreign countries and religious activities of Muslims in particular are subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government. State control has been implemented on Islamic madrasahs, Imams, and Mosques by Tajikistan. A list of sermon \\"topics\\" for Imams has been created by the Tajikistan government. Towns are only allowed to have a certain number of mosques and only religious buildings sanctioned by the government are allowed to host religious activities, schools have banned hijab, religious studies in private have been forbidden mosque religious services are not allowed to admit children and non registered mosques have been closed. Religious matters are banned for under 18 year old children, public buildings do not allow beards, schools ban hijabs, unregistered mosques are shut down, and sermons are subjected to government authority. Only if \\"provided the child expresses a desire to learn\\" can a family teach religion to their own children, while the Tajik government banned all non-family private education. Islam and Muslims have been subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government, the states decides what sermons the Imams give, the government discharges the salaries of Imams and there is only a single madrasah in Tajikistan. Jehovah's Witnesses have been declared illegal in Tajikistan. Abundant Life Christian Centre, Ehyo Protestant Church, and Jehovah's witnesses have accused Tajikistan of lying about them not being declared illegal at a Warsaw OSCE conference for human rights. Among increasingly religious Tajiks, Islamic-Arabic names have become more popular over Tajik names. The Tajik government has used the word \\"prostitute\\" to label hijab wearing women and enforced shaving of beards, in addition to considering the outlawing of Arabic-Islamic names for children and making people use Tajik names even though Imam Ali (Emomali) is an Arabic name and is the first name of the Tajikistan President. Tajikistan President Rakhmon (Rahmon) has said that the Persian epic Shahnameh should be used as a source for names, with his proposed law hinting that Muslim names would be forbidden after his anti hijab and anti beard laws. The black colored Islamic veil was attacked and criticized in public by Tajik President Emomali Rahmon. The Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan has been banned by the Tajik government and was labeled as a terrorist organization.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/tajikistan-poised-slide- war-160113160347274.html However, an Islamic Renaissance Party member subsequently visited Iran by the Iranian government, which was turned into an diplomatic protest by Tajikistan.http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan- condemns-iran-banned-islamic/27456013.html Tajikistan's restrictions on Islam has resulted in a drastic decrease of big beards and hijabs. Tajikistan bans Salafism under the name \\"Wahhabi\\", which is applied to forms of Islam not permitted by the government. To promote a better secular state, 160 Islamic clothing stores were shuttered and 13,000 men were forcibly shaved by the Tajik police and Arabic names were banned by the parliament of Tajikistan as part of a secularist campaign by President Emomali Rajmon.http://www.rferl.org/content/qishloq-ovozi-tajikistan-khatlon-police- beards-hijabs/27497194.htmlhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-35372754http://www.scoopwhoop.com/13000-Men-With-Beards-Were-Forcibly- Shaved-By-Police-In-Tajikistan/http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-ban- arabic-names-marriage-between-cousins/27486012.html In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, women wore veils which covered their entire face and body like the Paranja and faranji. The traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists but the Tajikistan President Emomali has misleadingly tried to claim that veils were not part of Tajik culture.

Douglas- Home was appointed editor of The Herald, a nationally circulated broadsheet newspaper in Scotland, in 2000. During his tenure the paper introduced new daily themed magazines, and continued to sell more than The Scotsman. It was announced on 1 December 2005 that he was leaving the paper. In the months before this, budget cuts imposed on the paper by owners Newsquest and he had been resistant to these. His first novel, The Sea Detective, was published by Sandstone Press in May 2011. A new edition was published by Penguin in November 2015. The Scotsman said it 'raises the bar' for Scottish crime fiction. The sequel, The Woman Who Walked into The Sea, was described as 'simply intoxicating' by the Library Journal in the USA. The third and fourth in the series, The Malice of Waves and The Driftwood Girls, were published respectively in May 2016 and January 2020. As a journalist, he is best known for having been the editor of The Herald newspaper in Scotland. The noble title, the Earl of Home in the Peerage of Scotland, belongs to his family, and his cousin, David Alexander Cospatrick Douglas-Home is the current holder. His uncle, the previous holder, was Alec Douglas-Home, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He is married to Colette Douglas-Home, a psychotherapeutic counselor, who was formerly a journalist and columnist. The couple have two children called Rebecca Douglas-Home and Rory Douglas-Home.

It was filmed in Mexico, directed by future Superman, The Goonies and Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner, and featured Jan-Michael Vincent as Lincoln 'Link' Simmons. The series comprises a six-hour adventure yarn broken down into 36 short chapters. Each chapter is roughly ten minutes long and includes a suspenseful cliffhanger ending that is resolved in the next installment. The live-action segment was created to cut production costs on the mostly-animated hour-long show. Plot Inspired by the animated Hanna- Barbera series Jonny Quest,The history of Danger Island Danger Island depicted the adventures of a trio of explorers in an unnamed tropical island group: Prof. Irwin Hayden, an archaeologist; Lincoln \\"Link\\" Simmons, the professor's youthful assistant; and Leslie, the professor's daughter, who serves as both a love interest for Link and the series' token damsel in distress. Several years earlier, the professor's brother (also an archaeologist) disappeared in the same island chain while searching for the mythical lost city of Tobanya. They are joined on their quest by Morgan, a shipwrecked merchant mariner, and his sidekick Chongo, who speaks only in a series of monkey-like chatters and birdcalls. They are pursued by a group of bumbling, but heavily armed, modern- day pirates led by the murderous Captain Mu-Tan, and by three tribes of cannibal natives known as \\"the Headhunters\\", \\"the Skeleton Men\\" and \\"the Ash Men\\". The show spawned a popularTV Tropes:Banana Splits catchphrase, \\"Uh-oh, Chongo!\\", among children of that time.

She was the second Navy ship to be named for Gunston Hall, the Mason Neck, Virginia estate of George Mason, one of Virginia's renowned Revolutionary figures, and \\"Father of the Bill of Rights\\". Gunston Hall was laid down on 26 May 1986, at the Avondale Shipyards, New Orleans, LA, launched on 27 June 1987, commissioned on 22 April 1989 and assigned to Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek. Gunston Hall is currently homeported at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia, and assigned to Amphibious Group 2 of the Atlantic Fleet. Ship history=1999 Gunston Hall deployed as part of the USS Kearsarge (KSG) amphibious ready group (ARG) on 14 April, 1999 and returned to Hampton Roads 14 October, 1999, following a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean. The other ships of the ARG were KSG (LHD 3), and USS Ponce (LPD 15) (PON), with 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Special Operations Capable (26 MEU(SOC)) and Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 6 embarked. On 15 April, 1999, Gunston Hall embarked K Company of 3/8 Marines with their Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAVs) in Morehead City, NC. Upon arrival on station in the Adriatic Sea to participate in OPERATION ALLIED FORCE and JOINT TASK FORCE (JTF) SHINING HOPE, the ARG deployed Marines from the 26 MEU(SOC) into Albania to construct a camp for refugees fleeing the fighting in Kosovo. Gunston Hall Sailors conducted a pre-landing survey of the proposed landing beaches to assist in selection of the best landing sites. As the Serbs withdrew from Kosovo, the ARG conducted a rapid withdrawal of the MEU(SOC), and conducted a high speed transit to Greece in order to again deploy the Marines ashore. An unopposed landing was conducted in Litokhoron, Greece to position the MEU(SOC) to enter Kosovo overland to provide an initial peacekeeping presence in the region, along with other NATO forces in OPERATION JOINT GUARDIAN. 26 MEU(SOC) spent 40 days in- country before the initial military technical agreements were finalized and more permanent security forces arrived. The ARG ships pulled into Thessaloniki, Greece, to backload the Marines and held a 'steel beach' cookout to celebrate their return. After enjoying liberty in several Mediterranean ports, the ARG/MEU team was once again called into action, this time to provide relief and assistance to Turkey in OPERATION AVID RESPONSE in the wake of a devastating earthquake. Gunston Hall Sailors participated in constructing a \\"tent city\\" to house thousands left homeless by the quake, and in the ARG/MEU deliveries of water and humanitarian supplies to many hard-to-reach sites within the country. Even after the heavy real world workload, Gunston Hall still participated in EXERCISE ATLAS HINGE to enhance at-sea and Marine interoperability with Tunisian forces. During the deployment Gunston Hall and K Co traveled more than 15 thousand miles, and visited ports such as Siracusa, Sicily; Haifa, Israel; Marmaris, Turkey; Ibiza, Spain; Taormina, Sicily; and Rota, Spain. 2006 It was announced on 9 October 2006 in the Halifax Herald in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada that the Canadian Navy will borrow the 186-meter amphibious assault ship for a brief period, and will pull it into CFB Halifax in early November, 2006. About 150 Canadian soldiers from CFB Valcartier, along with their light armored vehicles and G-wagons, will board the vessel and start training to storm beaches in landing craft, much like troops did in the Second World War. The U.S. military is providing mentoring and support during the operation.Thechronicleherald.ca 2008 While on deployment Gunston Hall engaged and gave chase to the tanker Golden Nori which had been hijacked by Somalian pirates. After days of chasing, Golden Nori was cornered in a Somali bay where USS Whidbey Island assisted with the extraction of the hostages. In July 2008, Gunston Hall underwent a midlife modernization availability at Metro Machine Corp. in Norfolk, VA, which included major upgrades to the ship's control system, local area network and machinery control system, propulsion systems, HVAC, as well as replacement of the ship's boilers and evaporators with an all-electric services system. The refit extended her expected service life which could be up until 2038. She completed subsequent sea trials 21 May 2009. 2010 Gunston Hall was deployed in January 2010, as part of rescue efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.Navy.mil On 18 January 2010, she anchored off Killick Navy Base and started relief operations. In August 2010, her Commanding Officer, Commander Fred R. Wilhelm, was relieved of his command by Rear Admiral Dave Thomas, commander of Naval Surface Force Atlantic, and reassigned to administrative duties ashore after allegations surfaced of sexual harassment and simple assault among the ship's crew. Wilhelm was replaced by Captain Mark H. Scovill. The ship's executive officer, Commander Kevin Rafferty, and former Command Master Chief Wayne Owings, were given non-judicial actions over the same incident.Lessig, Hugh, \\"USS Gunston Hall CO Is Relieved Of Command\\", Newport News Daily Press, 13 August 2010. 2011 In 2011 Gunston Hall participated in \\"Amphibious-Southern Partnership Station (A-SPS) 2011\\", during on a 2-month deployment to the SOUTHCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR), with stops in Belize, Colombia, Guatemala and Jamaica. Embarked with Gunston Hall was a USMC Theater Security Cooperation Task Force (TSCTF), composed of multiple Marine Corps units, and the staff element of Destroyer Squadron 40. The sailors and marines conducted subject matter expert exchanges (SMEEs) with partner nations and gave out gifts to needy children at their port visits. 2015 Gunston Hall experienced an onboard fire on 3 March 2015, while the ship was undergoing a maintenance availability at NASSCO/Earl Industries shipyard in Portsmouth, VA. The Portsmouth Fire Department responded and the fire was extinguished approximately 3 hours later. 2018 After completing the Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) in May, Gunston Hall departed Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek‚ÄìFort Story on 18 June 2018 to participate in naval exercises Southern Seas 2018 and UNITAS 2018. The ship completed multiple port calls to Naval Station Mayport, Florida, Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, Roat√°n, Honduras, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Santa Marta, Colombia and Cartagena, Colombia. After a brief return to Little Creek‚ÄìFort Story in order to resupply and embark the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, she departed for Reykjavik, Iceland to participate with and , to participate in Exercise Trident Juncture 2018. After a port call in Portsmouth, England, the ship returned on 4 December 2018.

He was mayor of Longueuil, Quebec, from 2001 until 2005 and is a former Member of Parliament. Background and early career A hospital worker in his youth, Olivier was elected president of the trade union local at Charles-LeMoyne Hospital and treasurer of Quebec's National Federation of Hospital Employees. In 1970, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Olivier as an aide to the Canadian Cabinet on labour relations. Election to Federal Parliament and Federal political role In the 1972 election, Olivier was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Member of Parliament for the riding of Longueuil. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1976 to 1978. Following the 1980 election, Olivier was elected chair of the Liberal Party's Quebec caucus. In January 1984, Trudeau appointed Olivier to the Cabinet as Minister of State for fitness and amateur sport. Olivier was dropped from Cabinet in June when John Turner became the new prime minister. He was defeated in the subsequent 1984 election. Business associations Following his defeat, Olivier established a Ford dealership in Saint-Hubert, Quebec, and soon joined the board of directors of the Corporation des concessionnaires automobiles du Grand Montr√©al et du Qu√©bec. Longueuil municipal politics In 1987, he ran to be mayor of Longueuil, but was defeated. He was elected mayor of the Montreal suburb in 2001, and serves as vice-chairman of the executive committee of the Montreal Metropolitan Community. During the Quebec municipal restructuring of 2002, Olivier became Mayor of the new Mega-city of Longueuil which merged the former cities of Longueuil, Boucherville, Brossard and Saint- Lambert; towns of Greenfield Park, LeMoyne, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville and Saint-Hubert. This merger was partially reversed after municipal referendums and was seen by many to be a failure on Olivier's part to sell the new Mega- City. Olivier led his own municipal political party, √©quipe Olivier, which held a large majority on Longueuil's city council. Olivier did not run in the 2005 municipal election and was succeeded as mayor by Claude Gladu.

His ideas played a significant role in the development of Ba'athism and its political movement. He published several books during his lifetime, most notably The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue (1943). Born into a middle-class family in Latakia, Syria, al-Arsuzi studied at the Sorbonne, where he became interested in nationalism. In 1930, he returned to Syria, where he became a member of the League of National Action (LNA) in 1933. In 1938, he moved to Damascus because of his disillusionment with party work, and in 1939, he left the LNA. In Damascus al- Arsuzi established and headed a group consisting of mostly secondary school pupils who would often discuss European history, nationalism and philosophy. Shortly after leaving the LNA, al-Arsuzi established the Arab National Party, an Arab nationalist party with a \\"defined creed\\". It was not a success and, on his return to Syria in November 1940 after a brief stay in Baghdad, al-Arsuzi established a new party, the Arab Ba'ath; by 1944, however, most of its members had left and joined Michel Aflaq's and Salah al-Din al-Bitar's Arab Ba'ath Movement, which subscribed to a nearly identical doctrine. In 1947, the two movements merged, forming a single Arab Ba'ath Party. Despite the merger, Al-Arsuzi neither attended its founding conference nor was given membership. During the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, al-Arsuzi stayed out of politics and worked as a teacher. He made a comeback during the 1960s power struggle in the Ba'ath Party between Aflaq and al-Bitar on one hand and Salah Jadid and Hafiz al-Assad on the other. When Aflaq and al-Bitar lost the power struggle and were forced to escape from Syria in 1966, al-Arsuzi replaced Aflaq as the main ideologue of the Syrian-led faction of the Ba'ath Party. Al-Arsuzi's theories about society, language and nationalism, which are collectively part of Ba'athist thought, hold that the Arab Nation will be unified when the Arab people reestablish the Arab identity they have lost over the past 1000 years. The key to Arab unification, according to al-Arsuzi, is through language. In contrast to the Latin language, al-Arsuzi argued, Arabic was far less arbitrary and far more intuitive. Despite his contributions to Ba'athist thought, al-Arsuzi is barely mentioned in Western or Arab scholarship. This omission may be linked to the fact that Sati' al-Husri, a contemporary Arab nationalist, had many of the same ideas as al-Arsuzi but was better able to articulate them. Biography=Childhood and early life: 1899‚Äì1930 Zaki al-Arsuzi was born in 1900 or 1901 to a middle-class familyHelms, 1984, pp. 64‚Äì65. of Alawi origins in Latakia on the Syrian coast of the Ottoman Empire. His mother, Maryam came from a prominent religious family, while his father, Najib was a lawyer. With his two brothers, one sister and his parents moved to Antioch in 1904. Arsuzi began his studies at a kuttab where he memorised the Quran. Four years later, his parents enrolled him into a r√º≈üdiye to give him a proper Ottoman education. His father was arrested by Ottoman authorities in 1915 for nationalist activities; Arsuzi later believed that this event triggered his interest in nationalist politics. His father was imprisoned for a short period before he and his family were sent to internal exile in the Anatolian city of Konya. After a year in exile, Najib and his family were allowed to move back to Antioch. According to Arsuzi, his father replaced the Ottoman flag with the Hashemite flag on the Antioch government house upon hearing the news that Faisal I of Iraq had entered Damascus. This however, was never independently verified. In the aftermath of World War I, Arsuzi began studying at Institut La√Øc in Lebanon. It was here that Arsuzi was introduced to philosophy. Also, during his stay, Arsuzi was able to perfect his French. During Arsuzi's studying at Institut La√Øc his atheism became notorious, and he was often caught saying \\"Sons of Earth are more capable of directing their affairs than sons of heaven.\\" After finishing his studies, Arsuzi got a job as a mathematics teacher in a local secondary school in Antioch. However, he later received the job of heading the school district of Arsuz ‚Äì a job he held from 1924‚Äì26. In 1927 Arsuzi received a scholarship from the French High Commission to study at the Sorbonne University in France. He studied there from 1927 to 1930, but never obtained a degree from the Sorbonne. During his stay at the Sorbonne, Arsuzi befriended former French colonial administrator Jean Gaulmier. At the Sorbonne, Arsuzi developed an interest in 19th-century European philosophy; he became attracted to the thoughts of Georges Dumas, Emile Brehier, Leon Brunschvig (his philosophy professor), Henri Bergson and Johann Gottlieb Fichte among others. The books which influenced Arsuzi most at the time were Bergson's L'Evolution cr√©atrice and Fichte's Reden an die deutsche Nation; of these, Fichte is the philosopher Arsuzi identified most with. Both Fichte and Bergson wrote of the importance of education and in the core there was the nation. The Alexandretta crisis and the founding of the Ba'ath: 1930‚Äì1939 Al-Arsuzi returned to Syria in 1930 and later worked as a teacher in Antioch in 1932. \\"The awakening was brutal,\\" according to historian Patrick Seale. The French authorities in Syria prohibited al-Arsuzi from teaching his students about European philosophy and the French Revolution among other topics. When he was caught teaching his students about the ideals of the French revolution‚Äîliberty, equality, fraternity‚Äîhe was forced out of the class. In 1934 al-Arsuzi founded a student club, the Club des Beaux Arts, with the ambition of spreading French culture; the club was frowned upon by the French authorities. Later that year al-Arsuzi began his political career in earnest and became a strident Arab nationalist. In August 1933, al-Arsuzi and fifty other Arab nationalists established the League of National Action (LNA) in the Lebanese city of Quarna'il. Most of the Arab parties at that time were dominated by the former Ottoman elite or had high levels of Ottoman membership. The LNA was one of the few exceptions; the majority of LNA members were young and had been educated in the West. While LNA initially proved popular with the people, its popularity shrank when its founder Abd al-Razzaq al-Dandashi died in 1935. Al-Arsuzi was the LNA's regional head in Antioch, from the founding of the party in 1933 until 1939.Moubayed, 2006, pp. 142‚Äì143. When Turkey first attempted to annex the province of Alexandretta in the early 1930s, al-Arsuzi became one of the most vocal critics of Turkey's policy towards Syria; he became a symbol of the Arab nationalist struggle.Choueiri, 2000, p. 144. In 1939 France, which controlled Syria, ceded the province to Turkey in order to establish an alliance with that state.Moubayed, 2006, p. 143. Al-Arsuzi left the LNA shortly thereafter.Schumann, 2008, p. 91. Al- Arsuzi moved to Damascus in 1938 and began working on his idea of Arabism and Arab nationalism. Disillusioned with party politics, he gathered several secondary school pupils to establish a learning group. At the group's meetings, al-Arsuzi would talk about, for instance, the French Revolution, the Meiji Restoration, German Unification and Italian Unification, or about the ideas of Fichte, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Oswald Spengler and Henri Bergson. Shortly after leaving the LNA, al- Arsuzi established the Arab National Party, an Arab nationalist party with a \\"defined creed\\". The party did not last long; al-Arsuzi left for Baghdad at the end of the year.Curtis, 1971, pp. 134‚Äì135. During his stay in Baghdad, al- Arsuzi tried, idealistically, to enlighten Iraqis with his thoughts of Arab nationalism, but returned to Syria disappointed in 1940.Curtis, 1971, p. 135. On 29 November 1940Rabinovich, 1972, p. 7. al-Arsuzi founded the Arab Ba'ath. The Arab Ba'ath: 1940‚Äì1947 Around the same time that al-Arsuzi founded the Arab Ba'ath another group, led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar, established the Arab Ihya Movement. Patrick Seale states that al-Arsuzi issued pamphlets under the name Al-Ba'ath, Al-'Arabi, while the Arab Ilhya Movement published pamphlets under the name al-Ihya, al-'Arabi.Seale, 1990, p. 30. While Aflaq and al-Bitar left work to focus on the party organisation, al- Arsuzi worked as a teacher until 1959. There were not many members in the party, and most of them used their time reading, writing and translating works. In June 1941 al-Arsuzi was exiled from Damascus, three members were arrested and the remaining members fled. The following year, in 1942, al- Arsuzi and his associates tried to revitalise the party, but the attempt failed. One of his associates claims that al-Arsuzi had become bitter and even paranoid during his one-year exile, exclaiming that the group \\"loved the people and hated the individual; [his group] held the whole sacred, but they despised the parts\\".Curtis, 1971, pp. 137‚Äì138. By 1944 the majority of Arab Ba'ath members had left the organisation for the more active Arab Ihya Movement (renamed to Arab Ba'ath Movement in 1943). Relations between Aflaq and al-Arsuzi were bitter at best; al-Arsuzi accused Aflaq of stealing his party's name. At the same time, al-Arsuzi's interest in politics was waning, and he spent an increasing amount of his time engaging in philology. In 1943 this work culminated in the publication of a book, The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue, an analysis of the roots and distinctive features of the Arabic language (see the Culture and language section). Despite this, al-Arsuzi appeared increasing unbalanced mentally. Several people noted that he became less social, and was more inclined to shun social contacts and friends. He would later suffer from delusions. He was forced to move on again in 1949, this time living in Lattakia and later moving to live with his mother in Tarsus. It was there that his mother would die, poverty-stricken.Curtis, 1971, p. 138. According to one of his associates, al-Arsuzi himself spent a great deal of time living in \\"extreme poverty\\", reduced \\"to a life of penury and persecution\\" by the French authorities.Seale, 1990, p. 28. Al-Arsuzi's popularity within his own ranks lessened after Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's coup in Iraq. While Aflaq and al-Bitar founded the Syrian Committee to Help Iraq to support Iraq during the Anglo‚ÄìIraqi War, al-Arsuzi opposed any involvement on the grounds that al-Gaylani's policies would fail. While several Arab Ba'ath members agreed with al-Arsuzi's conclusion, the majority were attracted to Aflaq's romanticism.Curtis, 1971, p. 139. Another reason for the Arab Ba'ath's failure was al-Arsuzi's deep mistrust of others; when a party member had written a manifesto entitled Arab Ba'ath, al-Arsuzi \\"saw in it an imperialist plot to block his way to the people\\".Curtis, 1971, pp. 138‚Äì139. The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, was merged into the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947. During negotiations Wahib al-Ghanim and Jalal al-Sayyid, not al-Arsuzi, represented the Arab Ba'ath, while Aflaq and al-Bitar represented the Arab Ba'ath Movement. The only policy issue which was discussed in great detail was how socialist the party was going to be. The groups came to an agreement; the Ba'ath movement became radicalised, and moved further to the left. Al-Arsuzi did not attend the founding congress, nor was he given membership in the new party.Seale, 1990, p. 34. Later life and death: 1948‚Äì1968 al-Arsuzi as seen in the early 1960s After his return from Baghdad in 1940, al-Arsuzi had gained a position teaching philosophy, but he was soon dismissed from it. From 1945 until 1952 he worked again as a secondary teacher, first in Hama and then in Aleppo, and from 1952 until his retirement in 1959, he taught in a teacher training college.Charif, 2000, p. 245. In 1963, in the wake of the Sixth National Congress of the Ba'ath Party and the party's gradual alienation from its founders Aflaq and Bitar, Hafiz al-Asad arranged for Arsuzi to help with Ba'athist ideological formation in the army,Commins, 2004, p. 47. and later ensured that he was granted a state pension.Seale, 1990, p. 89. Al-Arsuzi was elected to a seat in the National Command of the Ba'ath Party in 1965. Salah Jadid, the Ba'ath Party strongman at the time, opposed Aflaq's and al-Bitar's leadership of the party and, because of it, wanted al-Arsuzi to replace them as the original founder of Ba'athist thought.Choueiri, 2010, p. 113. Following the Ba'ath Party split of 1966 (the party split into two branches, one Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party and one Syrian-led Ba'ath Party) al-Arsuzi became the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party's main ideologue, while Aflaq was the de jure ideologue of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party.Bengio, 1998, p. 218. From 1966 to 1968 al-Arsuzi acted as al-Assad's and Jadid's personal ideological mentor.Moubayed, 2006, p. 144. Al-Arsuzi died in Damascus on 2 July 1968. Al-Arsuzi's thought=Arab Nation Al- Arsuzi's central thought was the unification of the Arab Nation. He believed that the Arab Nation could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The historical link to an Arab Nation was more important to al-Arsuzi than it was to other Arab nationalists and Ba'athists. The only way to create a new Arab Nation in the Modern Age was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language‚Äîthe only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the Arab Nation) and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non‚ÄìArabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics‚Äîthese laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.Suleiman, 2003, p. 148. Culture and language Al-Arsuzi paid considerable attention to cultural matters, and Batatu records that the only condition of membership in his organisation was \\"to write or translate a book contributing to the resurrection [ba'ath] of Arab heritage.\\"Batatu, 2000, p. 724. He has been described as a proponent of the \\"linguistic image of Arab nationalism\\", and in 1942 published one of his most important works, Abqariyyat al-'arabiyya fi lisaniha (The Genius of Arabic in its Tongue). His approach was distinguished by its emphasis on philology, but he did also pay attention to problems of the modern state and to questions of democracy and the locus of power.Batatu, 2000, p. 723. Batatu has also described al-Arsuzi as having a racist outlook, which proved in the end intellectually sterile and unsatisfactory to his followers, and as having been deeply influenced in his thought by the tenets of his Alawi religious background. Al-Arsuzi argued that unlike the Latin language, which is conventional and uses arbitrary signs to explain certain objects, the Arabic language formed words derived from the vocalism of its syllables and \\"in its expression of a direct representation of a natural object\\" ‚Äì unlike Latin, Arabic is essentially in conformity with nature. Arabic is, according to al-Arsuzi, an intuitive language; there is \\"a natural sympathy\\" between the pronunciation of Arabic words and their meaning: an Arabic word is united with its meaning by definition of a referent, which is absorbed in such an operation. For al-Arsuzi, the identity of the Arab Nation is embodied in the Arab language; it is the language that forms the source of the nationalist spirit. According to al-Arsuzi's theory, European nationalism is based on the principle of causality, while Arab nationalism is based on the principle of spontaneity.Choueiri, 2000, pp. 147‚Äì148. Al-Arsuzi's definition of language is in contrast to that of Socrates and other thinkers.Choueiri, 2000, p. 148. Nationalism Al-Arsuzi attributed the rise of European nationalism to revolutions in intellectual, social and economic domains. The first revolution came to being under the feudal system, which gave birth to human casual and relative relationships. The second revolution, the Scientific Revolution, led by Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei, ended the conception of nature developed during the Medieval Ages. These events created the foundations of modern rationality. On this subject al-Arsuzi said, \\"man was qualified to know the truth, since what is constructed by reason can be verified by experiment\\". Al-Arsuzi summed up this particular view of human behaviour and civilization with Ren√© Descartes's words: \\"Common sense or reason is naturally equal to man\\".Choueiri, 2000, p. 145. In al-Arsuzi's view, if humans were rational creatures, each would wish to organise themselves according to his or her own sense of reason, and hence would want to take over the affairs of state from oppressors (colonists). The colonists acted as a barrier to such \\"rational\\" change.Choueiri, 2000, pp. 145‚Äì146. Modern life existed because of two things‚Äîscience and industry. Science eliminated superstition, and replaced it with facts; and Industry enabled civilization to create a more strong, organised society where liberty, equality and democracy could become permanent. The experiences of the English and French Revolutions proved this; the revolutions gave the individual certain rights, so that the individual \\"could conduct his own affairs according to his will\\". The demand for liberty would eventually evolve into the demand for independence, literally nationalism. Nationalism had, according to al-Arsuzi, manifested itself in all walks of life, from the rule of law to the arts; everything in a nation was the manifestation of that particular nation's identity. Al-Arsuzi's thesis marked a dividing line between the Medieval Ages and the Modern Age.Choueiri, 2000, p. 146. Legacy Al-Arsuzi's work and thought is almost unknown and barely mentioned in Western scholarship on Arab nationalism. When he is actually mentioned in a text, it is predominantly on his irredentist views of the unified Arab Nation. Although his collected works have been published since the mid-1970s, al-Arsuzi's work on the Arabic language, which is central to al-Arsuzi's nationalist thought, are rarely mentioned at all. The study of al-Arsuzi's ideas in Arabic scholarship also lacking. Academic Yasir Suleiman gives the principal reason for this as the similarity of al- Arsuzi's works to those of Sati' al-Husri, a contemporary.Suleiman, 2003, pp. 146‚Äì147. Suleiman goes on to explain Al-Arsuzi's eclipsed legacy as the combination of a number of factors: firstly, in contrast to al-Husri's idea of language, al-Arsuzi's theory is self-defeating because it excluded other theories instead of including them. Secondly, his work was written with an elitist slant, rather than the populist one which al-Husri managed to convey. Thirdly, and in contrast to al-Husri's work, al-Arsuzi's work seemed old- fashioned, due to his use of old words and historical texts; moreover, while al-Arsuzi wrote about the symbolic need of an Arab Nation, al-Hustri wrote about the practical role of an Arab Nation‚Äîal-Arsuzi was obscure where al- Husri was transparent. Whereas Al-Husri was able to prove his arguments with empirical data, al-Arsuzi was unable. Thus, Suleiman writes, al-Husri appeared more informed then al-Arsuzi, when really he was not. The lack of empirical data in al-Arsuzi's work made it look parochial at times, while at other times his conclusions bordered on machoistic nationalism, which in turn could be interpreted as racism.Suleiman, 2003, p. 327. Another reason for his \\"negligible\\" impact, according to Suleiman, was al-Arsuzi's idea on the need to replace the traditional Arabic grammar system with a new one.Suleiman, 2003, p. 158. The Center for Research and Documentation on World Language Problems agrees with Suleiman's conclusion, but further claims that al- Arsuzi's work was \\"often far-fetched and 'airy-fairy'\\".CRDWLP, 2004, p. 287. Several Ba'athists, mostly from the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party, have denounced Aflaq as a \\"thief\\"; these critics claim that Aflaq had stolen the Ba'athist ideology from al-Arsuzi and proclaimed it as his own. Whatever the case may be, al-Arsuzi was hailed by Hafiz al-Assad, the Ba'athist leader of Syria, as the principal founder of Ba'athist thought, following the 1966 Ba'ath Party split. The Iraqi branch, however, still proclaims Aflaq as the founder of Ba'athism.Sluglett, 2001, p. 147. Al-Assad has referred to al-Arsuzi as the \\"greatest Syrian of his day\\" and claimed him to be the \\"first to conceive of the Ba'ath as a political movement.\\"Seale, 1990, p. 27. The Syrian Ba'athists have erected a statue in al-Arsuzi's honour; it was erected following the 1966 coup.Helms, 1984, p. 89. Even so, the majority of Ba'athists still agree that Aflaq, not al-Arsuzi, was the principal founder of the Ba'ath movement.Ayubi, 1996, p. 140. Despite this, Keith David Watenpaugh believes Ba'athism was conceived by the \\"trio\\" consisting of al-Arsuzi, Aflaq and Salah al-Din al- Bitar, and not one principal founder.Watenpaugh, 2006, pp. 228‚Äì229.

The Music of the Arabs, p.23. trans. Laurie Schwartz. Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press. . is a small musical interval of approximately 22.6415 cents, equal to one step of 53 equal temperament, or \\\\sqrt[53]{2} (). The name comma is misleading, since this interval is an irrational number and does not describe the compromise between intervals of any tuning system; it assumes this name because it is an approximation of the syntonic comma (21.51 cents)(), which was widely used as a measurement of tuning in William Holder's time. The origin of Holder's comma resides in the fact that the Ancient Greeks (or at least BoethiusA. M. S. Boethius, De institutione musica, Book 3, Chap. 8. According to Boethius, Pythagoras' disciple Philolaos would have said that the tone consisted in two diatonic semitones and a comma; the diatonic semitone consisted in two diaschismata, each formed of two commas. See J. Murray Barbour, Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey, 1951, p. 123) believed that in the Pythagorean tuning the tone could be divided in nine commas, four of which forming the diatonic semitone and five the chromatic semitone. If all these commas are exactly of the same size, there results an octave of 5 tones + 2 diatonic semitones, 5 √ó 9 + 2 √ó 4 = 53 equal commas. HolderW. Holder, A Treatise of the Natural Grounds, and Principles of Harmony, London, 3d edition, 1731, p. 79. attributes the division of the octave in 53 equal parts to Nicholas Mercator,\\"The late Nicholas Mercator, a Modest Person, and a Learned and Judicious Mathematician, in a Manuscript of his, of which I have had a Sight.\\" who would have named the 1/53 part of the octave the \\"artificial comma\\".  Mercator's comma and the Holdrian comma  Mercator's comma is a name often used for a closely related interval because of its association with Nicholas Mercator.W. Holder, A Treatise..., ibid., writes that Mersenne had calculated 58¬º commas in the octave; Mercator \\"working by the Logarithms, finds out but 55, and a little more.\\" One of these intervals was first described by Ching-Fang in 45 BCE. Mercator applied logarithms to determine that \\\\sqrt[55]{2} (‚âà 21.8182 cents) was nearly equivalent to a syntonic comma of ‚âà 21.5063 cents (a feature of the prevalent meantone temperament of the time). He also considered that an \\"artificial comma\\" of \\\\sqrt[53]{2} might be useful, because 31 octaves could be practically approximated by a cycle of 53 just fifths. William Holder, for whom the Holdrian comma is named, favored this latter unit because the intervals of 53 equal temperament are closer to just intonation than that of 55. Thus Mercator's comma and the Holdrian comma are two distinct but related intervals. Use in Ottoman music The Holdrian comma has been employed mainly in Turkish music theory by Kemal Ilerici, and by the Turkish composer Erol Sayan. The name of this comma is Holder komasƒ± in Turkish. For instance, the Rast makam (similar to the Western major scale, or more precisely to the justly-tuned major scale) may be considered in terms of Holdrian commas: 500px, where denotes a Holdrian comma flat, while in contrast, the Nihavend makam (similar to the Western minor scale): 500px, where denotes a five-comma flat, has medium seconds between d‚Äìe, e‚Äìf, g‚Äìa, a‚Äìb, and b‚Äìc', a medium second being somewhere in between 8 and 9 commas. ReferencesNotes In common Arabic and Turkish practice, the third note e and the seventh note b in Rast are even lower than in this theory, almost exactly halfway between western major and minor thirds above c and g, i.e. closer to 6.5 commas (three-quarter tone) above d or a and 6.5 below f or c, the thirds c‚Äìe and g‚Äìb often referred to as a \\"neutral thirds\\" by musicologists.

WagnerSee also , ) and other legislation. Such acts are investigated by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).Schlesinger Jr., Arthur M. The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal: 1933‚Äì1935. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1958, p. 400-406. Definition of \\"unfair labor practice\\" The NLRB has the authority to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices, which are defined in Section 8 of the Act. In broad terms, the NLRB makes it unlawful for an employer to: *interfere with two or more employees acting in concert to protect rights provided for in the Act, whether or not a union exists *to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of a labor organization *to discriminate against an employee from engaging in concerted or union activities or refraining from them *to discriminate against an employee for filing charges with the NLRB or taking part in any NLRB proceedings *to refuse to bargain with the union that is the lawful representative of its employees The Act similarly bars unions from: *restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights or an employer in the choice of its bargaining representative *causing an employer to discriminate against an employee *refusing to bargain with the employer of the employees it represents *engaging in certain types of secondary boycotts *requiring excessive dues *engaging in featherbedding (requiring an employer to pay for unneeded workers) *picketing for recognition for more than thirty days without petitioning for an election *entering into \\"hot cargo\\" agreements (refusing to handle goods from an anti-union employer) *striking or picketing a health care establishment without giving the required notice Applying this general language to the real world requires, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, \\"distinctions more nice than obvious\\". The substantive law applied by the NLRB is described elsewhere under specific headings devoted to particular topics. Not every unfair act amounts to an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an individual worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it. Filing of a charge While the employees of the NLRB may assist individuals in filing charges, the employees of the NLRB cannot file charges on their own. Under the Act, \\"any person\\" (except an employee of the Board) may file a charge with the NLRB. Such charges must be filed and served within six months of the events that constitute the basis of the charge. This deadline may be extended in some cases, e.g., if the party fraudulently conceals its violations of the law. Charges may also be amended if done so within six months of the alleged violation. Investigation and processing of the charge The General Counsel of the NLRB is responsible for investigating unfair labor practice charges and making the decision whether to issue a complaint. This job is delegated to the Regional Director of the region of the NLRB in which the charge has been filed; the Regional Director in turn assigns it to an employee of the region. It is the responsibility of the charging party to identify the witnesses who can support its charge; should it fail to do so the Regional Director will typically dismiss the charge. The Regional Director generally seeks to reach a decision as to whether to issue a complaint or to dismiss the charge within thirty days of the filing of the charge. The Region may also ask the charging party to amend its charge to eliminate unsupported claims in an otherwise meritorious charge or to add new claims uncovered by the Region in the course of its investigation. A party unsatisfied with the Regional Director's decision to dismiss its charge can appeal the dismissal to the office of the General Counsel. The General Counsel's decision to dismiss a charge is not subject to further appeal and cannot be challenged in court. If the issues raised by an unfair labor practice charge could also be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration. In those cases the General Counsel does not dismiss the charge, but holds it in abeyance while the parties to the contract arbitrate their contractual dispute. Issuance of complaint and settlement If the Region finds merit in the charge it will file a formal complaint setting out the violations of the law allegedly committed by the respondent. While the Act requires that the original unfair labor practice be filed within six months, there is no comparable statute of limitations for issuance of a complaint. The complaint may also be amended in some circumstances to include other alleged violations of the Act not specified in an unfair labor practice charge. The Region will usually renew its attempts to settle the matter after it has made the decision to issue complaint but before it has actually done so. It can settle unfair labor practice charges unilaterally, i.e., without the agreement of the charging party. The Board draws a distinction between formal and informal settlements, i.e., those that call for issuance of a formal Board order and those that do not. A party unhappy with the Regional Director's settlement of its unfair labor practice charges can appeal a formal settlement to the Board itself, which must approve any formal settlement in any case, but can only appeal an informal settlement to the General Counsel. The Board will set aside an informal settlement agreement if the employer violates the agreement or commits other violations of the Act after the agreement. The Board can, by contrast, enforce a formal settlement like any other Board order by petitioning the Court of Appeals for an order enforcing it. The Board will also accept non-Board settlements, in which the charging party withdraws its charge in return for promises from the other side. The Board is not, however, obliged to accept the parties' settlement agreement or to allow withdrawal of the charge. Interim injunctive relief If the General Counsel believes that there is cause to issue complaint, then he can seek injunctive relief from a federal district court under Section 10(j) of the Act. Injunctive relief is usually ordered when necessary to preserve the status quo pending the Board's decision on the complaint or to prevent employees from suffering irreparable harm. Any injunction lapses once the NLRB issues its decision. The General Counsel does not have to prove that the allegations in the complaint are well- founded, but only that he has some evidence, together with an arguable legal theory, to support his claims. Even so, the General Counsel rarely uses this power to seek relief while complaints are pending, other than in secondary boycott cases, in which the Act commands the General Counsel to seek injunctive relief. Hearing and decision If the case is not settled following issuance of a complaint, then the case will proceed to hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the NLRB. The Regional Director has the power to issue subpoenas for use by any party prior to the hearing; the Administrative Law Judge has that power once the hearing commences. The hearing is governed by the same rules of evidence that would apply in a federal court trial. The General Counsel functions as the prosecutor in these proceedings. Just as only the General Counsel can decide whether to issue a complaint, the General Counsel has exclusive authority to decide what charges to pursue. Interested parties may, however, intervene in these proceedings to present evidence or offer alternative theories in support of the charges that the General Counsel has alleged and to seek additional or different remedies than those that the General Counsel has proposed. The Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, which becomes final if not appealed to the NLRB. While the Administrative Law Judge's credibility determinations are ordinarily given great weight by the Board, they are not binding on it. The Board likewise is free to substitute its own view of the law for that of the Administrative Law Judge and frequently reverses its own precedents. Review by the courts A party that is aggrieved by a decision of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals. The Act gives parties a good deal of latitude as to which court they want to hear their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held. The NLRB's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders. The Court of Appeal reviews the Board's decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on a correct view of the law. While the courts are obligated in theory to give deference to the NLRB's interpretation of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it is convinced that the Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically in the choice of remedies to be applied. Any aggrieved party may also ask the Supreme Court to review a decision of the Court of Appeals. Such review by the Supreme Court is, however, discretionary and rarely granted. Compliance If the Court of Appeals enforces the Board's order then the case will return to the Region for it to monitor the respondent's compliance. In those cases in which the Board's order requires payment of backpay, the Region will commence compliance proceedings if it is not able to resolve all disputes over the amount of backpay. These compliance proceedings are also held before an Administrative Law Judge, based on the compliance specification filed by the Region. The same procedural rights apply in these proceedings as in the earlier proceedings on the merits of the charge.

Harald Bohr and Edmund Landau attribute the theorem to Jacques Hadamard, writing in 1896; Hadamard published no proof. Proof The three circles theorem follows from the fact that for any real a, the function Re log(zaf(z)) is harmonic between two circles, and therefore takes its maximum value on one of the circles. The theorem follows by choosing the constant a so that this harmonic function has the same maximum value on both circles. The theorem can also be deduced directly from Hadamard's three-lines theorem.

The team's top right-hander during its years in Milwaukee, he was the Most Valuable Player of the 1957 World Series, leading the franchise to its first championship in 43 years, and the only title in Milwaukee history. An outstanding control pitcher, his career average of 1.84 walks per nine innings pitched places him behind only Robin Roberts (1.73), Greg Maddux (1.80), Carl Hubbell, (1.82) and Juan Marichal (1.82) among pitchers with at least 3,000 innings since 1920. Major League career Born in Nitro, West Virginia, Burdette was signed by the New York Yankees in 1947, and after making two relief appearances for the team in September 1950, he was traded to the Braves in August 1951 for four-time 20-game winner Johnny Sain. Along with left-hander Warren Spahn and right- hander Bob Buhl, he gave the Braves one of the best starting rotations in the majors during the 1950s, winning 15 or more games eight times between 1953 and 1961. Burdette led National League pitchers in earned run average in . When Milwaukee won the 1957 World Series against the Yankees, Burdette became the first pitcher in 37 years to win three complete games in a series, and the first since Christy Mathewson in 1905 to pitch two shutouts (Games 5 and 7).Lew Burdette: His Moment of Glory Came in '57 Series, by Lou Chapman, Baseball Digest, October 1991, Vol. 50, No. 10, In the 1958 Series, however, the Yankees defeated Burdette twice in three starts. The final setback came in Game 7, which he started on only two days' rest, a decision for which manager Fred Haney was widely criticized. In addition to winning 20 games in and tying Spahn for the National League lead with 21 victories in , Burdette won 19 in 1956 and 1960, 18 in 1961, and 17 in 1957. Burdette was the winning pitcher on May 26, when the Pittsburgh Pirates' Harvey Haddix pitched a perfect game against the Braves for 12 innings, only to lose in the 13th. Burdette threw a 1‚Äì0 shutout, scattering 12 hits. In the ensuing offseason, he joked, \\"I'm the greatest pitcher that ever lived. The greatest game that was ever pitched in baseball wasn't good enough to beat me, so I've got to be the greatest!\\" On August 18 of the following year, facing the minimum 27 batters, Burdette no- hit the Philadelphia Phillies 1-0 at Milwaukee County Stadium. Tony Gonz√°lez, the only opposing batter to reach base after being hit by a pitch in the fifth inning, was retired on a double play. Burdette helped himself by scoring the only run of the game; after doubling to lead off the eighth inning, he scored on Bill Bruton's double one batter later. Following up his no-hitter, five days later he pitched his third shutout in a row. In 1963 Burdette was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals (1963‚Äì64), and was later sent to the Chicago Cubs (1964‚Äì65) and Phillies (1965). Signing with the California Angels, he pitched exclusively in relief for the team in 1966 and 1967 before retiring. Career statistics In an 18-year career, Burdette posted a 203‚Äì144 record with 1074 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA in 3067.1 innings, compiling 158 complete games and 33 shutouts. In two All-Star games, he allowed only one run in seven innings pitched, and in he topped National League pitchers with a 2.70 earned run average. He was twice a 20-game winner and twice led the National League in shutouts. He also led the National League in wins, earned run average, innings and complete games once each. His totals of wins, games and innings with the Braves ranked behind only Spahn and Kid Nichols in franchise history. He won his only NL Player of the Month award in August 1958 (7-1, 1.89 ERA, 38 SO); teammate pitcher Joey Jay had won the award the month previous. As a hitter, he compiled a .183 batting average (185-for-1011) with 75 RBI and 12 home runs; his first two home runs came in the same 1957 game, and he later had two more two-homer games. He also hit a home run in Game 2 of the 1958 World Series, being the first pitcher to do so since Bucky Walters in 1940. Pitching style Burdette was a very fidgety pitcher, constantly scratching himself and fussing with his uniform before pitches. Former manager Fred Haney once said, \\"Burdette would make coffee nervous.\\" Frequently repeated motions such as bringing his fingers to his lips and wiping sweat from his forehead lead to rumors of throwing spitballs.The Case of the Suspected Spitter, LIFE Magazine, September 10, 1956, Vol. 41, No. 11, After the second game of the 1957 season, Birdie Tebbetts, manager of the Cincinnati Reds, called Burdette a \\"cheating spitballer,\\" prompting Redlegs' GM Gabe Paul to lodge an official protest with the National League. NL President Warren Giles responded with a statement clarifying that it was okay for a pitcher to moisten his hands as long as he did not transfer the moisture to the baseball and said, \\"Until someone ‚Äî the umpires or someone ‚Äî presents evidence that Burdette is using the spitter, I'll do nothing about it.\\" Burdette himself said, \\"It's the best pitch I've got ‚Äî and I don't throw it.\\" The rumors persisted, though: Don Hoak said, \\"Only once did I ever see water fly off a spitball, and the man who threw me that pitch was Burdette.\\" The Sporting News wrote in 1967, \\"Perhaps no pitcher has engendered more controversy about the spitter than Lou Burdette.\\" New York Times sportswriter Red Smith wrote, \\"There should be 3 pitching statistics for Burdette: Wins, Losses, and Relative Humidity.\\" Burdette himself referenced this reputation, saying he retired because \\"they were starting to hit the dry side of the ball.\\" Personal life Burdette was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame.Lew Burdette at the Florida Sports Hall of Fame He died of lung cancer at age 80 in Winter Garden, Florida. In 1958, a reference to Burdette appeared in an episode of Leave It To Beaver. The text \\"Lew Burdette just hit a home run and Milwaukee leads seven to one in the series.\\" appears briefly in a few frames showing a letter from the principal to Beaver's parents. Burdette also cut a record in the 1950s entitled \\"Three Strikes and Then You're Out\\". Burdette's grandson, Nolan Fontana, is a professional baseball player.

Its boundaries are north of Spring Garden Street, west of Broad Street, south of Girard Avenue and east of The Schuylkill River. While this may be the most common demarcation, the area's boundaries fluctuate depending how the neighborhood is defined. Several subdivisions exist within and near these boundaries including: Spring Garden, Franklintown and Francisville. Fairmount is commonly referred to as the \\"Art Museum Area,\\" for its proximity to and association with the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Fairmount is also the location of the Eastern State Penitentiary. The name \\"Fairmount\\" derives from the prominent hill on which the Philadelphia Museum of Art now sits and where William Penn intended to build his manor house. Later, the name was applied to the street originally called Hickory Lane that runs from the foot of Fairmount Hill through the heart of the neighborhood. History A handful of European settlers farmed the area in the 17th, 18th, and early 19th century, when Fairmount was still outside Philadelphia's city limits. Prominent city families established countryseats there as well, including Bush Hill, White Hall, and Lemon Hill, the last of which still stands overlooking the Schuylkill River. Fairmount was originally in Penn Township, which was subsequently divided, putting the future neighborhood in the newly created Spring Garden District until 1854 when it was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia. During the American Revolution, British soldiers occupying Philadelphia built defensive works starting on the hill of Fairmount and continuing several miles along a line just south of present-day Fairmount Avenue to the Delaware River. Their purpose was to prevent American troops under George Washington from attacking them from the north - the only side of the city not protected by water. Signs of urban expansion appeared in the early 19th century, when three large, innovative, and internationally recognized institutions were located in the district. The first of these was the Fairmount Dam and Water Works at the foot of Fairmount Hill. Beginning in 1822, the Water Works used waterpower to pump water from the Schuylkill River into reservoirs on the top of Fairmount Hill, from where it flowed by gravity into city homes and businesses. An engineering wonder, it was also an architectural and scenic attraction. Its buildings, which included a restaurant, are among the earliest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the United States. Protection of the municipal drinking water that the Water Works pumped was the impetus for the purchase of lands along the Schuylkill that later became Fairmount Park, one of the world's largest municipal park systems. Charles Dickens listed the Water Works as one of the two things he particularly wanted to see while in Philadelphia. The other was Eastern State Penitentiary, less than half a mile away on Fairmount Avenue. The prison opened in 1829, the first prison in the country built specifically with the intention of reforming rather than simply punishing criminals. The prison's hub-and-spoke layout was also a first, and became the model for hundreds of prisons around the world (it was often called the \\"Pennsylvania Model\\"). Its unique system of solitary confinement for all prisoners did not, however. Intended to provide prisoners relief from the overcrowding and squalor of other prisons and give them time to reflect on their crimes, it led instead to intense despair and sometimes insanity among the inmates and was roundly condemned by Dickens when he visited. In 1831, these two innovative institutions were joined by a third: Girard College. This school was founded in accordance with the will of Stephen Girard, possibly the wealthiest man in America at the time of his death. Himself an orphan, he wanted to create a model institution for educating poor orphaned white boys at a time when universal public education did not yet exist. The executor of Girard's estate was another prominent and wealthy Philadelphian, Nicholas Biddle, former US Secretary of the Treasury, who commissioned the building of Founders Hall in honor of Girard. The Hall is the first example of true Greek Revival architecture in the United States and is, like both the Water Works and Eastern State Penitentiary, a National Historic Landmark. In 1968 Girard College entered the nation's awareness again when the United States Supreme Court altered Girard's will by striking the words \\"poor, male, white, orphan\\" and set a major precedent for equal access to education for all Americans. These three institutions were built when Fairmount was still a rural suburban district of Philadelphia. Beginning in the 1830s, the city itself began to grow beyond its original boundaries, and a mixture of homes and factories sprang up on the district's southern fringes. The Baldwin Locomotive Works, the nation's largest maker of locomotive engines, was located on the southeastern edge of the future Fairmount neighborhood and was a major factor in development of the neighborhood south of Fairmount Avenue in the 1840s, 50s, and 60s.Bergdoll Mansion on 22nd and Green Streets Fairmount‚Äôs homes were generally smaller row or town houses and the residents were generally working class. Row houses were interspersed with lumber yards, coal yards, lime yards, iron foundries, bakeries, dry goods stores, as well as several wagon works and stables. Many of these were built in the second half of the 19th century to support factories and breweries in the area. Fairmount has many large houses built for the managers of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, other professionals, and brewery owners which date back to the 1840s. Fairmount is near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, its famous ‚ÄúRocky Steps‚Äù (immortalized in the 1976 Academy Award film, Rocky and its new Perelman Annex). Fairmount is located at the end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a broad 1.5-mile tree- and flag- lined avenue that connects City Hall to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. This stretch is known as the ‚ÄúMuseum District‚Äù since most of the city‚Äôs cultural attractions and museums are located here. Along the Parkway are the Rodin Museum, Philadelphia‚Äôs Central Library, the Franklin Institute of Science, the Academy of Natural Sciences and the Barnes Museum. Based upon the famous Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris in its design and owing to its ability to hold vast numbers of people, the Benjamin Franklin Parkway is also where most of Philadelphia‚Äôs large outdoor events, parades, concerts, and races are held. Eastern State Penitentiary located on Fairmount Avenue has become another main draw for the neighborhood. Tours of this historic 1829 facility, now abandoned, are offered. It is also annually converted into a haunted house during the Halloween season and, because of its resemblance to the Bastille, it is part of Philadelphia‚Äôs Bastille Day celebration. Infrastructure and government The United States Postal Service operates the Fairmount Post Office at 900 North 19th Street.\\"Post Office Location - FAIRMOUNT.\\" United States Postal Service. Retrieved on December 4, 2008.  Demographics  Fairmount is a predominately white section of North Philadelphia. The neighborhood has become increasingly gentrified over the years, with newcomers to Philadelphia settling in the area for its proximity to Center City. As of the 2000 census, the racial makeup of Fairmount, Spring Garden, and Francisville is 65.23% White, 24.24% African American, 3.93% Asian, and 4.09% from other races. 7.63% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population of Fairmount grew by 3% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Education Fairmount is zoned to schools in the School District of Philadelphia. Fairmount is divided between two attendance zones for Kindergarten through 8th grade: * Bache-Martin Elementary Schoolhttp://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/b/bache-martin\\"Bache-Martin Elementary School .\\" Center City District. * Laura Wheeler Waring Elementary Schoolhttp://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/schools/w/waringLaura Wheeler Waring Elementary School .\\" Center City District. Parents in the Fairmount neighborhood no longer have the opportunity to send children to the Albert M. Greenfield School, as the school no longer accepts applications from outside the catchment. The neighborhood Catholic elementary school is St. Francis Xavier School. For High School, Fairmount residents are assigned to the Benjamin Franklin High School, but many residents attend Roman Catholic High School, J. W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School. Philadelphia Mennonite High School is a private Mennonite high school with about 100 students at 860 North 24th Street in Fairmount.

The group publishes position papers, organizes events, and runs campaigns in order to advocate for changes in U.S. immigration policy. The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies FAIR as a hate group with close ties to white supremacist groups. FAIR is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and was founded in 1979 by Michigan surgeon, eugenics supporter, and former president of Zero Population Growth John Tanton, former historian of labor movements and director of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions Otis L.

Retrieved 20 February 2017. Dan Stein has been president of FAIR since 1988. Mission According to their website, FAIR seeks a moratorium on net immigration by anyone other than refugees and the spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens, until it can be shown that higher immigration levels are needed. FAIR also believes that the economic and social growth in the United States are no longer sustainable at the current rate of the influx of immigrants into the country. Therefore, it argues that the country as a whole ought to devise policies which set limits on immigration and promote an environment for sustainable development. FAIR identifies itself as a \\"group whose membership runs the gamut from liberal to conservative, [whose] grassroots networks help concerned citizens use their voices to speak up for effective, sensible immigration policies that work for America‚Äôs best interests\\". Its Board of Advisors has included individuals such as former Congressman Brian Bilbray (R-CA) and former Governor Richard Lamm (D-CO). The group promotes policies to improve border security and stop illegal immigration, and to reduce legal immigration into the United States to around 300,000 people a year. FAIR's policy studies emphasize the environmental, economic, and social effects of mass immigration. FAIR's President Dan Stein serves on the 61-member board of the Citizens' Debate Commission, a nonpartisan American organization formed in 2004, which was established to sponsor future general election presidential debates. FAIR is a member of the Coalition for the Future American Worker, which describes itself as \\"an umbrella organization of professional trade groups, population/environment organizations, and immigration reform groups. CFAW was formed to represent the interests of American workers and students in the formulation of immigration policy.\\"  Principles  FAIR advocates \\"7 Principles of True Comprehensive Immigration Reform\\": : 1. End Illegal Immigration : 2. No Amnesty or Mass Guest-Worker Program : 3. Protect Wages and Standards of Living : 4. Major Upgrade in Interior Enforcement, Led by Strong Employers Penalties : 5. Stop Special Interest Asylum Abuse : 6. An Immigration Time Out : 7. Equal Under the Law : In 1994, Fair supported California Proposition 187. In 2004, the Federation for American Immigration Reform cooperated with the group called Protect Arizona Now in order to support the passage of Proposition 200, which shares similarities with California‚Äôs Proposition 187 as to which undocumented immigrants are restricted from public benefits and voting because they are most likely unable to provide the required proof of citizenship. It also made the crime of a public official not reporting illegal status a class 2 misdemeanor. History The \\"founder of the modern immigration reform movement\\"‚ÄîJohn Tanton‚Äîan ophthalmologist in Petoskey, Michigan‚Äî\\"saw a threat coming in the soaring rates of immigration\\" and that the \\"environment was threatened by overpopulation\\". Frustrated by the lack of interest of his \\"liberal colleagues in groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club where he was actively engaged, he helped establish \\"three major national groups\\"‚ÄîFAIR, Numbers USA and the Center for Immigration Studies‚Äîto fight to reduce [legal and illegal] immigration.\\" Tanton‚Äîalong with University of North Carolina professor Otis Graham and former Gulf Oil CEO, Sydney Swensrud‚Äîestablished FAIR in 1979. In 1982 Tanton also established U.S. Inc, a foundation chaired by Tanton with financial support from Cordelia Scaife May which would over the years, serve as a funding conduit for FAIR, Numbers USA, the Center for Immigration Studies, and many other groups. FAIR's first executive director was environmental lawyer Roger Conner. Other co-founders included feminist Sharon Barnes, philanthropists Jay Harris and Stewart Mott (of the Stewart R. Mott Foundation) and William Paddock, dean of Zamorano the Pan American School of Agriculture Dan Stein has been president of FAIR since 1988. In American Immigration: An Encyclopedia of Political, Social, and Cultural Change, Brian N. Fry described Tanton as the \\"leader of the drive to restrict immigration\\" starting in the mid-1970s. Fry described those who favored maintaining or increasing immigration numbers as \\"expansionists\\" and those who sought to reduce them as \\"\\"restrictionists.\\" Fry traced \\"restrictions roots\\" to a surprising surge in illegal and legal immigration‚Äîthe \\"new immigration\\"‚Äîfollowing the 1964 termination of the Bracero Program and the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Tanton as President of Zero Population Growth from 1975‚Äì77 attempted to get members to \\"support immigration restrictions.\\" When they were unwilling, he launched FAIR with seed money in 1979. Throughout the 1980s FAIR's lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill met with more success as did their direct mail campaigns. FAIR received funds from donors such as Cordelia Scaife May (1928‚Äì2005) through her Laurel Foundation(1928‚Äì2005) and the Pioneer Fund which contributed $1.2 million to FAIR in the 1980s and early 1990s. Following negative publicity about FAIR receiving funds from Pioneer Fund when they were revealed in a Los Angeles Times article, FAIR stopped \\"receiving grants\\" from Pioneer that required \\"public disclosure.\\" The SPLC claimed FAIR continued to \\"receive private financial support from Pioneer's leaders for several years.\\" Tanton had wanted FAIR to focus on issues related to Hispanics in the United States, such as \\"cultural division\\" and bilingualism. He was unable to convince FAIR's board of directors to shift their focus. However FAIR helped Tanton establish U.S. English as the umbrella organization for \\"projects pertaining to overpopulation, immigration, and the environment. Through the work of Senator Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa (R-CA) (1906‚Äì1992) and Tanton, U.S. English became a well-organized and well-funded official movement resulting in twenty-two states enacting official language laws to protect English between 1981‚Äì97. From 2007‚Äì15, Julie Kirchner was FAIR's executive director. In 1991 historian Eric Hobsbawm explained the rise of FAIR, US English and English first in the United States in the 1980s as part of a larger political phenomenon of xenophobia that \\"feeds on hostility towards the new mass migrations\\". He quoted a Czech historian, \\"Where old social relations become unstable, amid the rise of general insecurity, belonging to a common language and culture may become the only certainty in society, the only value beyond ambiguity and doubt.\\" Hobswan was citing another author FAIR became \\"the stuff of lore in 2007, with their successful campaign against Bush's proposed Immigration Reform which represented \\"a systemic overhaul including a path to citizenship for most illegal immigrants.\\" \\"FAIR rallied talk show hosts...The Center for Immigration Studies published \\"studies of the bill's perceived flaws\\" and \\"Numbers USA jammed the Capitol's phones.\\" FAIR had become the \\"most important organization [in the United States] fueling the backlash against immigration\\" and Tanton was perceived as the leader. As a result, liberal groups who opposed FAIR focused on Tanton who was at that time \\"in his 32nd year on the board.\\" Tanton was concerned that US birthrates had dropped \\"below replacement level. In 1986 Tanton wrote memos to FAIR colleagues‚Äîwhich became known as the WITAN memos‚Äîpredicting a \\"Latin onslaught\\" and worried that high Latino birth rates and low US birthrates would lead \\"the present majority to hand over its political power to a group that is simply more fertile\\". He was concerned Latinos would \\"bring with them the tradition of the mordida ['bribe'], the lack of involvement in public affairs.\\" He asked, \\"What are the differences in educability between Hispanics (with their 50% dropout rate) and Asiatics (with their excellent school records and long tradition of scholarship)?\\" The memos‚Äîwhich became known as the WITAN memos‚Äîwere leaked to the press in 1988. He warned that unless Latino immigration was restricted it would ultimately \\"lead to linguistic, economic, racial and religious \\"apartheid\\" in the United States.\\" He cautioned, \\"I've come to the point of view that for European- American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that.\\" When the WITAN memos were leaked to the press in 1988, Tanton eventually had to resign from U.S. English. although he denied the accusations. FAIR has created several affiliated groups, including the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) and the FAIR Congressional Task Force (FCTF) as a 501(c)(4). url has security warning The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) was spun off from FAIR in 1985. FAIR has held an annual \\"Hold Their Feet to the Fire\\" (F2F) event since 2007 in Washington, D.C. In 2008, Lou Dobbs, a regular (F2F) attendee, broadcast on live television from the event‚Äôs rally, commended FAIR. He was fired from CNN in 2009 and hired at Fox the next year, to run a similar show.Lou Dobbs' new Fox Business show gets a start date and a name, The Huffington Post, March 3, 2011. In September 2009 two divisive issues‚Äîimmigration and health care‚Äîbecame \\"politically linked\\" when partisan health reform opponents challenged what they perceived as subsidized health care for illegal immigrants. By early September the bipartisan Gang of Six negotiations on a compromise for the health care reform bill, had fallen apart. Senators who had previously \\"embraced the framework\\" were convinced by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell that they were being politically unwise. Their rhetoric turned \\"shrill\\" and \\"anti-reform\\" with one Senator talking about \\"death panels that would kill grandma.\\" The furor on immigration \\"escalated\\" into what The Washington Post called a \\"proxy war.\\" FAIR's annual \\"Hold their Feet to the Fire\\" event\\" in Washington on September 14 and 15, was described by The Post as a \\"Capitol Hill lobbying push..[with] 47 conservative radio hosts holding a 'town hall of the airwaves'... [highlighting] the costs of illegal immigration.\\" America's Voice's Director Frank Sharry said, \\"conservative activists\\" had attempted to \\"intimidate\\" Congress by \\"tapping into a thin but vocal vein of populist anger... We didn't call them out last time, we thought we were in a political debate. Now we realize it's part political debate and... part culture war. These talk-show guys and FAIR, this isn't about immigration policy, as much as they think there are way too many Latinos in this country and they want to get rid of a couple of million of them.\\" The SPLC strongly denounced FAIR and its founder. FAIR president Dan Stein stated in The Post article that the SPLC had \\"decided to engage in unsubstantiated, invidious name-calling, smearing millions of people in this movement who simply want to see the law enforced and, frankly, lower levels of immigration\\" and that \\"America's Voice and allied groups were 'juvenile mud throwers who seem unprepared to engage in serious public debate'. In a 2011 article in The New York Times, a former aide to President Ronald Reagan, Linda Chavez, was cited as saying that 77-year-old Tanton was \\"the most influential unknown man in America.\\" paywall In a 2011 interview published in The New York Times and The Houston Chronicle, FAIR's President Dan Stein said, \\"Is FAIR responsible for everything [John Tanton] said in his private correspondence? No, I love John, but he's had no significant control over FAIR for years.\\" By the end of 2016, FAIR's annual budget reached $11.2 million. In May 2017, Julie Kirchner, FAIR‚Äôs executive director since 2005, was named as ombudsman of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman reporting to the Department of Homeland Security. A 2017 FAIR report claimed that undocumented immigrants in the United States cost taxpayers approximately $134.9 billion. This report included the children of undocumented immigrants, even those who were U.S. citizens, in the cost calculation. According to the Associated Press, \\"the estimate was criticized for making broad generalizations and other major methodological flaws.\\" Controversy  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) currently classifies FAIR as a hate group, citing among other things the organization's anti-Latino and anti-Catholic attitudes, its acceptance of $1.2 million from a racist foundation, the Pioneer Fund, its hiring as key officials men who also joined white supremacist groups, having board members who also write regularly for hate publications, its promotion of racist conspiracy theories, and the white supremacist beliefs of its founder. In 1982, John Tanton wrote \\"As Whites see their power and control over their lives declining, will they simply go quietly into the night? Or will there be an explosion.\\" The SPLC issued an intelligence report in 2007, after which they added FAIR to its list of hate groups. FAIR responded to this charge by stating that there is no factual basis for the accusation; that FAIR has compiled a long record of mainstream credibility and respect on immigration issues and has always opposed discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion; and that the accusation is an \\"act of desperation, resulting from the SPLC's failure to convince the American people of their viewpoint.\\" In August 2018, FAIR's former press secretary, Joe Gomez, filed a complaint with the Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights, alleging racist, xenophobic, and ableist harassment at FAIR. Gomez‚Äôs Attorney Chris Bell, accused FAIR of misrepresenting the settlement to media outlets by wrongly saying the D.C. Office of Human Rights dismissed the complaint because it had no merit. Instead, the office dismissed the complaint because a settlement was reached, according to Bell. ‚ÄúIf they continue to misrepresent the truth, I‚Äôm going to set the record straight,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúThere was never an agreement [FAIR] could go out and misrepresent the truth.‚Äù See also *Center for Immigration Studies * NumbersUSA * You Don't Speak for Me ReferencesExternal links * Category:Anti-immigration politics in the United States Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

Brock's business card Seattle Computer Products (SCP) was a Tukwila, Washington, microcomputer hardware company which was one of the first manufacturers of computer systems based on the 16-bit Intel 8086 processor. SCP began shipping its first S-100 bus 8086 CPU boards to customers in November 1979, about 21 months before IBM introduced its Personal Computer which was based on the slower 8088 and introduced the 8-bit ISA bus. SCP shipped an operating system for that hardware about a year before the release of the PC, which was modified by Microsoft for the PC and renamed IBM PC DOS. SCP was staffed partly by high-school students from nearby communities who soldered and assembled the computers. Some of them would later work for Microsoft. Corporate history Twenty-two-year-old Tim Paterson was hired in June 1978 by SCP's owner Rod M. Brock (26 August 1930 ‚Äì 30 November 2018). At the time, SCP built memory boards for microcomputers, but after attending a local seminar on Intel's just-released 8086 in late summer 1978, Paterson convinced Brock that his company should design a CPU board for the new chip. Paterson had a prototype working by May 1979, and he took his \\"computer\\" over to Microsoft, who were working on an 8086 BASIC, which was working before the end of May. When the board began shipping in November, standalone Microsoft BASIC was offered as an option, but no operating system was available for it. Digital Research, whose 8-bit CP/M operating system was the industry standard, was working on an 8086-compatible version called CP/M-86, but the delay in its release was costing SCP sales. In order to fill this void, Paterson wrote QDOS (for Quick and Dirty Operating System) over a four-month period starting in April 1980. QDOS 0.11 was finished in August 1980, and SCP began shipping it in September 1980. The operating system was renamed to 86-DOS in December 1980. Microsoft, having worked with SCP before and seeking an operating system they could modify for the IBM PC, bought the rights to market the 86-DOS operating system to other manufacturers for that same month. On 27 July 1981, just prior to the launch of the IBM PC on the 12 August 1981, Microsoft bought the full rights to the operating system for an additional , giving SCP a perpetual royalty-free license to sell 86-DOS (including updated versions) with its computer hardware. Realizing that Microsoft was making significant profit on the 86-DOS operating system, SCP attempted to sell it along with a stand-alone inexpensive CPU (without any other circuitry). This was allowed as per SCP's license with Microsoft, which let SCP sell the operating system with their 8086-based computers; this operating system was marketed as \\"Seattle DOS\\", and a CPU was included in the box it shipped in. Thanks to the deal with Microsoft, additional capital allowed Seattle Computer to expand its memory business into providing additional memory for PC products. The company had its best year in 1982, reaping more than a million dollars in profit on about $4 million in sales. By 1985, however, SCP's business was having difficulty trying to compete with offshore products (Brock once said, \\"they were selling memory boards for less than his cost for parts\\"), and Brock decided to sell the company. The only major asset SCP had left was the license it received from Microsoft when it signed over ownership rights to 86-DOS. Brock planned to sell (via merger) the license to the highest bidder, with a company such as the Tandy Corporation in mind. After Microsoft objected to Brock's \\"exaggerated interpretation\\" of the agreement and informed Brock that his license was nontransferable, Brock sued for million. The ensuing lawsuit was highly technical and grew to fill hundreds of pages in the months leading up to trial. The trial began at the end of 1986 and lasted three weeks. An out- of-court settlement was reached while the jury was deliberating. Microsoft paid SCP and reclaimed its license for DOS. SCP went out of business in the late 1980s as the market for Intel 8086 systems became dominated by PC compatible computers.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Lucario first appeared as a Cameo in Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, then, a central character in the film Pok√©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, and later appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl and subsequent sequels, also appearing in various merchandise, spin-off titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Lucario is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa, Daisuke Sakaguchi, Rikako Aikawa and Kiyotaka Furushima in Japanese, and Bill Rogers and Sean Schemmel in English. Known as the Aura Pok√©mon, Lucario can sense and manipulate , a special kind of energy emitted by all living creatures. Since its debut, Lucario has received critical acclaim, and has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Lucario has also been featured as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series since Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  Concept and creation  The design and art direction for Lucario was provided by Ken Sugimori, a friend of the creator of the Pok√©mon games, Satoshi Tajiri. The species made its first non cameo appearance in the animated film Pok√©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, released in Japan in 2005. In an interview, Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl director Junichi Masuda noted Lucario's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences. Lucario is a canid-like Pok√©mon that is a bipedal digitigrade with finger-like digits on its forepaws. Its chest and the exterior of its wrists each feature a single, white spike. It also has a large snout and ears, red irises with vertical slit pupils, an \\"hourglass\\"-shaped figure with leering thighs significantly thicker than the rest of its body, iron rings incorporated into its shoulders and waist, and a raccoon's \\"mask\\" that loosely resembles a khakkhara with four small dreadlock-like appendages on the back of its head that are used to sense Aura. The coloration of Lucario's fur is predominantly blue and black, although its torso features buff-colored fur slightly shaggier than the rest of its body. When it opens its mouth wide enough, sharp fangs can be seen. Lucario can sense and manipulate aura, a form of energy emitted by all living things, and understand human speech. As a result, Lucario can read the thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit, to the point that it can even see otherwise invisible foes. Lucario is somewhat of an empath; when properly trained, it can accurately identify the feelings and emotions of others over half a mile away. Lucario has a pre-evolution called Riolu, which is a pure Fighting-type Pok√©mon rather than a Fighting/Steel-type Pok√©mon and cannot manipulate Aura as capably as Lucario due to its lack of experience. As Mega Lucario, its appearance undergoes a few noticeable changes. Its body gains rigid, black streaks on its arms, legs and face which are created by the energy generated by Mega Evolution intermingling with its Aura, the latter of which is significantly heightened. The buff-colored fur on its slender torso becomes shaggier and envelopes its tail, and its Aura-sensing appendages grow considerably longer. Lucario also gains additional spikes on its torso, forepaws, and hind paws. Lastly, its paws and Aura-sensing appendages are now colored crimson. Although Mega Lucario possesses significantly greater offense and speed, the energy of Mega Evolution also brings about a drastic change to its mentality, often causing it to face opponents with an aggressive, menacing fighting style.  Appearances = In the video games  Lucario's first video game appearance and debut is in Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon:Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, though only appears as a Statue Cameo when the player gets 15,000 points and the Lucario rank, then appeared in is Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, where its pre-evolved form, Riolu, can be obtained as an egg from Riley. Riolu evolves into Lucario when it reaches a sufficiently high level of happiness. Lucario is used by notable trainers Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader; a tag team partner known as Riley; Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion; and by Bruno, an Elite Four member of Johto. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon Lucario is perceived as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and his adventures have become legendary. After reaching a certain number of points, a Lucario statue will be displayed outside the rescue base. While the player never meets Lucario, Alakazam tells the player that his goal is to become closer to Lucario's greatness. Lucario can be found and befriended in Lost Wilderness dungeon in Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Time and Darkness, but it has no particular main role. However, in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky and Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, its pre-evolution form Riolu may be played as the main character or be chosen as the partner Pokemon. Lucaio appears as a boss Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, as the guardian of the Blue Gem. Lucario is one of the few Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon X and Y that can use the new Mega Evolution mechanic while holding Lucarionite, its Mega Stone; doing so results in it Mega Evolving into Mega Lucario in the process. Lucario also appears as an NPC in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok√©Park 2: Wonders Beyond. Due to an unintentional leak on Nintendo's official Super Smash Bros. website, which detailed how certain stickers could only be applied to certain characters, Lucario was indirectly confirmed as a playable character for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. In Brawl, Lucario is unlocked upon being encountered in the story mode at The Glacial Peak, or through other special means.Smash Bros. DOJO!! http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/hidden06.html Lucario's special moveset consists of Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, and Double Team, each of which it can learn within the Pok√©mon games. Its \\"Final Smash\\", Aura Storm, consists of launching a powerful beam of Aura, which the player can adjust in a slow, fanning motion.Lucario's All-Star Mode trophy information in Super Smash Bros Brawl. Lucario's fighting style revolves around a mixture of martial arts, predominately Shaolin Kung Fu, and Aura manipulation. Aura itself is also a game mechanic unique to Lucario: its attacks become stronger as it continues to receive damage. Lucario returned as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and again in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, now being voiced by Sean Schemmel as in Pok√©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Additionally, its Aura mechanic now affects the entirety of its moveset and has made Lucario's attacks riskier, yet more rewarding, due to the mechanic's damage multipliers being adjusted. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Lucario's Mega Evolution, Mega Lucario, replaced Aura Storm as its Final Smash, reflecting the form change introduced in Pok√©mon X and Y. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, its Final Smash consists of it Mega Evolving into Mega Lucario before performing Aura Storm. In addition to the Super Smash Bros. series, Lucario appears as a playable character in Pokk√©n Tournament. Lucario has also been a part of the third wave of amiibo, with its figure having been released on January 22, 2015 in Japan, and as a Toys \\"R\\" Us-exclusive beginning in February 2015 in North America.  In the anime  Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pok√©mon movie, Pok√©mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. In the movie, Lucario is a servant to a nobleman named Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend, although after Aaron traps him in a magic staff, Lucario begins questioning any Pok√©mon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, voiced in English by Sean Schemmel, can speak human languages with telepathy. Lucario sacrifices himself to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron in the afterlife, where they happily eat a chocolate bar. Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, has a Lucario and it was seen in four different episodes of the Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension series. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario uses Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pok√©mon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battles in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeats Dawn's Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battles in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeats Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but gets knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, resulting in a tie. Finally, Lucario was seen when it helps Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic. A different Lucario appears on Iron Island, owned by a trainer named Riley. Lucario protects Ash from Pok√©mon on the island that are fighting against each other. Lucario appeared in BW107 and BW108, under the ownership of Cameron. As a Riolu, it battles Ash's Snivy, Unfezant, and Pikachu, where it evolves while battling Snivy. It defeats all three, giving Cameron the victory. However, in Cameron's battle with Virgil, Virgil's Flareon defeats Lucario, eliminating Cameron from the tournament. Another Lucario later apppeared in XY030-034 and XY043-044, under the ownership of the Gym Leader Korrina. In XY031, Korrina and her Lucario attempt to retrieve a Lucarionite guarded by a Blaziken. Due to its type weakness, Lucario proved to be no match for Blaziken, but under the encouragement of Ash and his friends, it finally attempts to immobilize Blaziken. Before it gives the final blow, the Blaziken is revealed to be owned by Gurkinn, Korinna's father. They retrieve the Lucarionite, allowing it to Mega Evolve. In episode XY032, Korinna uses her Mega Lucario to battle Ash, but due to lack of control over its transformation, it soon runs out of control until Gurkinn's Lucario stops it. In XY034, Lucario finally gains full control of its Mega Evolution and successfully defeats Team Rocket, who were attacking Ash and his friends. It later participated in a gym battle against Ash in XY44, using it's newfound Mega Evolution to defeat Ash's Fletchinder and Hawlucha, though eventually losing to his Pikachu. This Lucario appeared again in the 25th episode of Pokemon Journeys, facing Ash's Gengar and Dragonite, defeating the former but losing to the latter. Ash's Riolu will evolve into a Lucario in a future episode of Pokemon Journeys.  In other media  In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pok√©mon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! the main character, Hareta, gains an egg from Riley which hatches into a Riolu; it later evolves into Lucario. Phantom Thief Pok√©mon 7 is centered on a boy and his Lucario who take back stolen items from thieves. The name Lucario itself appeared also in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team saga where, after the end of the main scenario, the player can talk to Alakazam who tells them the story of a Lucario being a legendary Pok√©mon rescuer.  Promotion and reception  Since it appeared in the Pok√©mon series, Lucario has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Lucario is featured on a collector's tin which contains one Lucario card as well as four booster packs from the Diamond and Pearl series. Beckett Pok√©mon Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. UGO described Lucario as \\"a new breed of Pok√©mon\\" citing its \\"cooler, more dangerous look\\". Due to its quick movement and powerful attacks, they called it an \\"attractive choice as an underdog fighter\\" for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. IGN called its presence in Super Smash Bros. Brawl \\"a bit on the head scratching side\\" in light of more familiar characters in the title, such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for Pok√©mon to be represented by a Fighting-type Pok√©mon, since Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as \\"the Bruce Lee of Pok√©mon\\". Game Informer stated that Lucario earned its spot in Super Smash Bros. from being one of the most popular Pok√©mon of the Diamond and Pearl generation.

The channel, which launched on December 18, 1995, provided 24-hour rolling news coverage focused primarily on the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and northwest Montana). The channel was headquartered out of the studio facilities of Tegna- owned NBC affiliate KING-TV (channel 5) in downtown Seattle. The channel was available to 2.9 million residents (through both cable television and over- the-air) within the region, and, to a lesser extent, Alaska, Northern California, and other areas of Montana. Some of the network's programming was carried on a sister broadcast station KTVB in Boise, during the overnight hours. From August 28, 2009 to January 20, 2015, it was also aired over the air on their DT3 subchannel, as well as Cable One. It was previously on Cable One until 2003; it was re-added on February 12, 2010. On January 20, 2015, a corporate mandate where Gannett became a charter carrier of the Justice Network meant that it was replaced on KTVB-DT3, and it was carried on Dish Network from April 26, 2011 to February 29, 2016, when it was removed per a mutual decision between the two parties. On October 28, 2016, Northwest Cable News announced that the channel would shut down on January 6, 2017. The closure arrived after the retirement or contract buyouts of several high- profile on- and off-screen talent the previous April. It came at a time when the channel's viewership had decreased in the face of increased news consumption on digital and other non-television platforms, along with the nationwide streaming availability of the newscasts live or delayed of the stations contributing content for the network via their websites, effectively making the entire operation superfluous and duplicative. In addition, the network did not broadcast in HD, which was nearly universal for television news in the U.S. by the time of the shut-down announcement. Approximately 20 employees were affected, and Tegna offered some of them positions at other Tegna stations. Programming The network incorporated news content purposed from four Tegna-owned stations in the northwestern United States ‚Äì NBC- affiliated stations KING-TV in Seattle, KGW in Portland, KTVB in Boise and CBS affiliate KREM in Spokane. In addition, the channel maintained content sharing agreements with several other stations. In addition to rolling news and weather coverage throughout the day, Northwest Cable News produced the nightly sports highlight and discussion program Northwest Sports Tonight (weeknights at 9:00 p.m.) and the call-in shows Gardening with Ciscoe LIVE (which aired Friday evenings at 6:00 p.m.) and Northwest Sports Tonight Game Day (which aired evenings after Seattle Seahawks games during the NFL season). The channel also aired rebroadcasts of sister station KING-TV's lifestyle program Evening each evening at 10:00 p.m. Three other KING-TV programs, Gardening with Ciscoe (a pre-recorded program which the live NWCN program was spun off from), Northwest Backroads and The 5th Quarter (which aired during the NFL season), were also rebroadcast on the channel on weekends. In addition, the channel aired the KGW-produced Sunday evening discussion program Straight Talk. In February 2011, NWCN switched their format from 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio. At the time of the channel's shutdown, NWCN was the last news station in the Tegna portfolio that did not air their newscasts in HD (although some of its content has been aired in HD digitally online).

Under the current territorial division of the Mexican Federal District, it is a part of the borough (delegaci√≥n) of Coyoac√°n. It is centred on the former Franciscan monastery (ex convento de Churubusco) at . The name \\"Churubusco\\" is the interpretation the Spanish conquistadors gave to the original Nahuatl name Huitzilopochco - meaning \\"place (or temple) of Huitzilopochtli\\". Earlier attested forms that the adapted name took include Huycholopuzco, Ocholopusco, Ochoroposco, Uchilubusco, and Chulibusco. Churubusco's monastery at the height of the 1847 Battle of Churubusco History=11th century The first settlers are believed to have arrived in the area, possibly fleeing the fall of the Toltec Empire. 15th century Aztec glyph for Huitzilopochco. Huitzilopochco existed as an independent lordship within Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Its first ruler was Huitzilatzin, a grandson of Huitzilihuitl, the second Tlatoani (\\"emperor\\"). Its population numbered some 15,000 dedicated to the cultivation of fruit and flowers and the extraction of salt from the neighboring Lake Texcoco. A temple (teocalli) dedicated to the worship of Huitzilopochtli stood at a location known as Teopanzolco. Within the Aztec Empire, this teocalli ranked second only to the one at the Templo Mayor in Mexico-Tenochtitlan (some 10 km to the north). Huitzilopochco was famous for the hummingbird feathers (sacred to Huitzilopochtli) that it sent in tribute to the capital. 16th century In 1503, Ahuitzotl, the eighth Tlatoani, connected a nearby spring to the Mexico-Tenochtitlan water supply. This is believed to have been the direct cause of the great flood of that year that devastated the city and claimed hundreds of lives - including that of Ahuitzotl. During Hern√°n Cort√©s's siege of Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1521, Huitzilopochco was razed to the ground. Some years later, Franciscan friars founded a small convent in the Teopanzolco district, using stones from the destroyed teocalli of Huitzilopochtli. The convent was dedicated to Mary, Queen of Angels. The Franciscans appear to have abandoned it shortly after; the church was transferred to the care of the regular clergy and, in 1580, responsibility for the convent was handed to a second group of Franciscan friars (discalced dieguinos). They rebuilt the monastery and added a novitiate and a school. 17th century In the second half of this century, thanks to the generosity of one Diego del Castillo and his wife, the monastery was completely rebuilt and much expanded. Rededicated in 1678, it now consisted of an oratory, dormitories, schoolrooms, a library, a refectory, upper and lower cloisters, a dispensary and an apothecary, and an Andalusian-style courtyard built around a well. 18th century A series of enhancements were made to the monastery and its church, including a churrigueresque altar dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1766 and the installation of an organ in 1791. In 1797 an independent chapel, dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, was erected. 19th century Battle of Churubusco. On 20 August 1847, during the U.S. invasion of Mexico, a bloody and decisive battle was fought in Churubusco ‚Äì specifically, in the vicinity of the monastery. In 1857, President Ignacio Comonfort had a monument commemorating the heroic defence of the monastery built in front of its main gates. The remains of Francisco Pe√±√∫√±uri and Luis Mart√≠nez de Castro, two army officers who led their men to perish in a desperate bayonet charge after running out of ammunition during the battle, were interred inside. In 1869, during the Reform period under President Benito Ju√°rez, the monastery was taken over by the state. It was converted into a military hospital specialising in contagious diseases. 20th century In 1917, the National University's Inspectorate of Artistic and Historic Monuments managed to convince the authorities that the former monastery would fare better as a museum: as a hospital, it had been more than a little neglected and was in danger of collapse. The museum was opened to the public in 1921. With the rapid expansion of Mexico City during the mid-20th century, Churubusco ceased to be a separate village and was swallowed up by the urban sprawl of the capital. The motion picture production facility of Estudios Churubusco - the nerve centre of the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema - opened in the district in 1945. Present day The former monastery of Churubusco now houses the state-run \\"Interventions Museum\\" (Museo de las Intervenciones), documenting the different assaults on its territorial integrity that Mexico has suffered since declaring its independence in 1810: 1829 (Spain), 1838 (France), 1846 (USA), 1862 (France), and 1916 (USA). It stands in a residential neighbourhood just outside the southernmost loop of the inner ring-road, in the middle of a pleasant, wooded plaza. Metro General Anaya (named for Pedro Mar√≠a Anaya) is located in the vicinity. Other nearby street names commemorating the area's history include \\"Calle H√©roes del 47\\", \\"Calle 20 de Agosto\\", and \\"Calle M√°rtires Irlandeses\\".

The Laune is well known for salmon and trout fishing. The river Laune is Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference) long and combined with the River Flesk ,Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference) which feeds Lough Leane, has a total length of . It has a mean flow rate of 43 m¬≥/s.Riverine Inputs and Direct Discharges to Convention Waters Annex V Statistical information on river catchment areas P. 70 (Convert 1,000m¬≥/d into m¬≥/s) The River Laune flows approximately 20 km to drain Killarney‚Äôs Lough Leane into the sea at Castlemaine Harbour. The Laune carries most of the rainfall from the MacGillycuddy Reeks, Ireland‚Äôs highest mountain range. Many streams on the south side of the Reeks drain into Killarney‚Äôs Upper Lake before filtering down to Lough Leane. As the River Laune drains Lough Leane to the sea, it is fed by two rivers running north from the Reeks, the River Loe from the Gap of Dunloe and the Gaddagh River from the heart of the Reeks. Another tributary, the Cottoners River, carries rainwater from the west of the Reeks. On the southern side of the bridge, a low embankment runs upstream for about 1 km towards Killarney. This is part of over 40 km of embankments that prevent the sea from flooding low-lying land around Castlemaine Harbour. These embankments exist due to Napoleon‚Äôs dominance in Europe around the year 1808. The British government were looking for alternative sources of hemp to make sailcloth for their navy to defend against a possible invasion. If the bogs of Ireland could be drained then they could be used to grow this raw material without affecting the existing agricultural output of the country. In 1811‚Äì1812 Alexander Nimmo surveyed and mapped over 76,000 acres (30,700 ha) of land on the Iveragh Peninsula for the Bogs Commission. Over 17,000 acres (7,000 ha) of this were on the sea shore area of the Laune River, Lower Maine River, and Castlemaine Harbour. These stone and earthen banks still prevent high tides flooding much of this land. The banks vary from 1 m to over 5 m in height. Sluice gates allow water drain out at low tide and prevent rising tides from flooding the land. The banks run from the townland of Tullig near Cromane, to Killorglin, part way up the Laune, around the area of Callinafercy, up both sides of the Maine River and along the north side of Castlemaine Harbour, part way to Inch. Various major repairs are evident where large rocks and concrete have replaced the stone and earth, although much of the original banks are still intact. The Killorglin river bank walk and the Astellas river bank walk downstream of the Metal Bridge are both part of these 200-year-old embankmenthttp://www.killorglintidytowns.com/the-county-bridge.html Killorglin County Bridge Killorglin County Bridge over the River Laune Killorglin‚Äôs County Bridge was built in 1885. It replaced an older wooden bridge that apparently got covered during high Spring tides. The current bridge is built from local limestone, moved by horse and cart from Steelroe Quarries approximately 1 km away on the Tralee Road. Stonecutters shaped each stone by hand to make up the piers, the eight stone arches and the side walls of the bridge. Each arch is 15.24 m long making a total length of 123 m. Art on the Laune In 2001 the Killorglin Millennium Committee built ‚Äú Faiche Ri Na Phoic‚Äù (The lawn of King of Puck) and erected the Puck Statue at the northern end of the bridge. The goat symbolises the tradition of Puck Fair held in the town on 10, 11, and 12 August every year since the early 17th century. thumb The Puck Poets Corner was added in 2010. This displays verses about Killorglin from various contributors dating back as far as the year 1876. Featuring poets such as Edso Crowley, Sigerson Clifford, Johnny Patterson and Peter Joy.

He has mastered such a wide variety of instruments that Acoustic Guitar magazine referred to Lindley not as a multi-instrumentalist, but instead as a \\"maxi- instrumentalist.\\" The majority of the instruments that Lindley plays are string instruments, including the acoustic and electric guitar, upright and electric bass, banjo, lap steel guitar, mandolin, hardingfele, bouzouki, cittern, baƒülama, gumbus, charango, c√ºmb√º≈ü, oud, and zither. Lindley was a founding member of the 1960s band Kaleidoscope, and has worked as musical director for several touring artists. In addition, he has occasionally scored and composed music for film. Early life and career When Lindley was growing up in Los Angeles, his father had an extensive collection of 78 rpm records that included Korean folk and Indian sitar music. Lindley took up the violin at age 3, but broke the bridge. He then moved on to the baritone ukelele in his early teens. Then Lindley took to playing the banjo and the fiddle. By his late teens, he was acknowledged as an award-winning player, having won the Topanga Banjo‚Ä¢Fiddle Contest five times. He began to frequent the folk music scene of the 60's, patronizing clubs like the Ash Grove and the Troubador, and encountering an eclectic assortment of music, including flamenco, Russian folk music, and Indian sitar music. He found that radio played a very open assortment of music. From 1966 to 1970, Lindley was a founding member of the all-styles psychedelic band Kaleidoscope which released four albums on Epic Records during that period. After Kaleidoscope broke up, he went to England and played in Terry Reid's band for a couple years. In 1972, he teamed up with Jackson Browne, and played in his band through 1980. During the 1970s, he also toured as a member of the bands of Crosby-Nash, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. In 1981, Lindley formed his own band, El Rayo-X. Jackson Browne produced their first album. Their last show before breaking up was December 31, 1989. Since that time, he has toured as a solo artist, and as half of a duo, first with Hani Naser, then with Wally Ingram. He also played on a multitude of studio sessions. Between his work in the studio as a session musician or on tour as a sideman or bandleader, Lindley has worked on learning new instruments. He is famous for having written the only song glorifying (a brand of) condoms, \\"Ram-a-Lamb-a-Man,\\" from his album \\"Win this Record!\\" Work with other artists Lindley with Ry Cooder, Brisbane, 1980 Lindley is known for his work as a session musician. He has contributed to recordings and live performances by Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, Linda Ronstadt, Curtis Mayfield, James Taylor, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Terry Reid, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Toto, Rod Stewart and Joe Walsh. He has also collaborated with fellow guitarists Ry Cooder and Henry Kaiser. Artist Ben Harper has credited Lindley's distinctive slide guitar style as a major influence on his own playing and in 2006 Lindley sat in on Harper's album Both Sides of the Gun. He is known in the guitar community for his use of \\"cheap\\" instruments sold at Sears department stores and intended for amateurs. He uses these for the unique sound they produce, especially with a slide. In the early 1990s, he toured and recorded with Hani Naser adding percussive instruments to his solo performances, and his instrumental repertoire which he uses in his session work. In recent years, Lindley has also toured extensively and recorded with reggae percussionist Wally Ingram. It is his touring around the world that has exposed him to part of his array of instruments that appear exotic to many Western audiences. Lindley's voice is heard in the version of \\"Stay\\" performed by Jackson Browne. Browne's version is a continuation of \\"The Load Out\\", and its refrain is sung in progressively higher vocal ranges. The refrain of \\"Oh won't you stay, just a little bit longer\\" is sung first by Browne, then by Rosemary Butler, then by Lindley in falsetto. Lindley joined Jackson Browne for a tour of Spain in 2006. Love Is Strange: En Vivo Con Tino, a 2-CD set of recordings from that tour, was released May 11, 2010, with Browne and Lindley touring together starting in June of that year.

Early years Lunna was born and raised by both her parents in Ponce, Puerto Rico. While in elementary school, she learned how to play the guitar and in 1972, her mother had her take private singing lessons. In the 1960s, while still in high school, she began to sing under the name \\"Sockey\\", which was short for her middle name Socorro.Music of Puerto RicoLunna In 1978, Lunna auditioned and was accepted in a group called Allegro 72, a locally popular group which included singer Tito Lara and Luis Antonio Cosme. Besides singing for Allegro 72, she also landed jobs singing radio and television commercials. Lunna eventually left the group to start singing solo. Her agent recommended that she change her artistic name, resulting in the \\"Lunna\\" name. She met and became romantically involved with Puerto Rican rock and roll teen idol, Charlie Robles. This romance was highly publicized in Puerto Rico and soon they were married. Sockey and Charlie had a daughter, Lisa Marie, from this marriage; however, things didn't go well in the marriage and the couple ended up in divorce. Singing career In 1982, Lunna traveled to Lima, Peru, to represent Puerto Rico at the OTI Festival, with the song \\"Sin tu m√∫sica\\" (Without your music). Her fame soared in Puerto Rico, but her career was interrupted because of personal reasons. After four years of absence from the world of music, Glenn Monroig, a fellow singer, convinced her to return. Together they recorded the album A Todo Dar (Everything Gives), the first digitally produced album in Puerto Rico. The album was renamed Motivos (Motives) and was produced by √Ångel \\"Cuco\\" Pe√±a, it became a big \\"hit\\" in Puerto Rico. Among the songs included in the album was the song \\"Yo Perd√≠\\" (I Lost). \\"Yo Perd√≠\\" was converted into a musical video, filmed in 35 mm. In 1987, Lunna was signed by A&M; Records and recorded the following successful songs, \\"No Digas Nada\\" (Don't Say Anything), \\"Ni Princesa, Ni Esclava\\" (Nor Princess, Nor Slave) and \\"Fugitiva Amante\\" (Fugitive Lover). That same year, she was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1988 and 1989, Lunna continued to score more \\"hits\\" with the recording of \\"Soledad\\" (Loneliness), \\"Quien No Ha Sentido...\\" (Who Hasn't Felt...) and with \\"C√≥mo Ser Amantes\\" (How to be Lovers) written by Michael Bolton. In 1992, Lunna reunited with Glen Monroig and they recorded the album Yo Que Te Ador√© (I, Who Have Adored You). In 2003, Lunna recorded Lunna de Bohemia, which included many classical boleros. That same year, she suffered a personal tragedy when her son died. Lunna, who is also a jazz lover, participated in the \\"Heineken Jazz Jam Session\\" and in the \\"Tropical Night at the Seaport\\". Personal life In 1983, Lunna married √Ångel \\"Cuco\\" Pe√±a, with whom she had three children, Gabriel, Juan and √Ångel (they later divorced). Her son Juan Sebasti√°n Pe√±a, tragically lost his life in a traffic accident. Lunna almost died while giving birth to her youngest child √Ångel‚Äò Cuquito ‚ÄôPe√±a. The child had his cord umbilical wrapped around his neck.Primera Hora - La muerte le enseno a vivir Lunna and her daughter. Lisa Marie Robles were among those present at the funeral home since the early hours of the day and stood next to the coffin of her first husband Charlie Robles, in 2011.

After it rises it passes the flowing areas, first Milford and down towards Belville bridge, then on to Castlemahon (Mahoonagh) and nearby Newcastle West, running parallel to the main Limerick-Killarney N21 road, to reach Rathkeale. After leaving Rathkeale, the river crosses the N21 and flows north to Askeaton. It then crosses the N69 before entering the Shannon Estuary a further 4km north. Name The Deel derives its name from daol, an Irish word for a beetle, insect or worm, because of its winding, bending shape.

Pre-Adamism is therefore distinct from the conventional Abrahamic belief that Adam was the first human. Advocates of this hypothesis are known as \\"pre-Adamites\\", along with the humans who they believe existed before Adam. Early development The first known debate about human antiquity took place in 170 AD between a Christian, Theophilus of Antioch, and an Egyptian pagan, Apollonius the Egyptian (probably Apollonius Dyscolus), who argued that the world was 153,075 years old. An early challenge to biblical Adamism came from the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, who, upon his rejection of Christianity and his return to paganism, accepted the idea that many pairs of original people had been created, a belief termed co-Adamism or multiple Adamism. St. Augustine's The City of God contains two chapters indicating a debate between Christians and pagans over human origins: Book XII, chapter 10 is titled Of the falseness of the history that the world hath continued many thousand years and the title of book XVIII, chapter 40 is The Egyptians' abominable lyings, to claim their wisdom the age of 100,000 years. These titles tend to indicate that Augustine saw pagan ideas concerning both the history of the world and the chronology of the human race as incompatible with the Genesis creation narrative. Augustine's explanation aligned with most rabbis and with the church fathers, who generally dismissed views on the antiquity of the world as myths and fables, whereas Jewish and Christian claims were based on revealed truth. Augustine did take a critical view of the young earth narrative in some aspects, arguing that everything in the universe had been created simultaneously by God, and not seven literal days. He was primarily concerned with arguing against the idea of humanity having existed eternally rather than a Bible-based chronology of human history. 900‚Äì1700 In early Islam, a common belief held that mankind is actually the successor of other intelligent creatures such as Jinn and Hinn. Medieval Muslim traditions referred to the Jinn as pre-Adamites, depicted as human-like in various ways. Although the notion of Jinn as pre-Adamites was generally accepted, the idea that other humans lived before the known Adam was controversial. From the mid- ninth century onward the idea appeared that God created several Adams, each of whom presides over an era lasting around 50,000 years. This concept was regarded as heretical, but was widely accepted by Ismailis and Sufis. A book titled Nabatean Agriculture, written or translated by Ibn Wahshiyya in 904, collated texts about the activities and beliefs of Arabic groups such as the Nabataeans, in defense of Babylonian culture against Islam. The book discussed the ideas that people lived before Adam, that he had parents, and that he came from India. It proposed that Adam was the father of an agricultural civilization, rather than the father of the entire human race. The Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi wrote his Kitab al Khazari between 1130 and 1140, featuring a discussion where the King of the Khazars questioned three theologians (a Jewish rabbi, a Christian, and a Muslim) which was the true religion, and raised the challenge that people in India said they had buildings and antiquities which were millions of years old. The rabbi responded that his faith was unshaken, as the Indians lacked \\"a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found.\\" The rabbi dismissed Indians as dissolute, unreliable people, whose claims could be ignored. Later in the book, Halevi rejected the Nabatean claims as these people did not know of the revelation in Scripture, and he dismissed Greek theories of an eternal world. In his conclusion, Halevi maintained that Adam was the first human in this world but left open other possibilities: \\"If, after all, a believer in the Law finds himself compelled to admit an eternal matter and the existence of many worlds prior to this one, this would not impair his belief that this world was created at a certain epoch, and that Adam and Noah were the first human beings.\\" The claims in Nabatean Agriculture were also disputed by Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204) in The Guide for the Perplexed. He attributed the concepts to the Sabians and said they were just legends and mythology which deviated from monotheism though drawing on Jewish sources, but in refuting the speculations, he circulated an outline of the ideas among other scholars: \\"They deem Adam to have been an individual born of male and female like any other human individuals, but they glorify him and say that he was a prophet, the envoy of the moon, who called people to worship the moon. and there are compilations of his on how to cultivate the soil.\\" He noted the claim that Adam came from India, and went on to Babylon. The presence of a belief in the existence of men before Adam among the Familists, a religious community in Friesland, was noted by John Rogers in 1578. In 1591, Giordano Bruno argued that, because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, God must have either created separate Adams or that Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamic races. The 17th-century French millenarian Isaac La Peyr√®re is usually credited with formulating the pre-Adamite theory because of his influence on subsequent thinkers and movements. In his Prae-Adamitae, published in Latin in 1655, La Peyr√®re argued that Paul's words in should be interpreted to mean that \\"if Adam sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people.\\" Thus, according to La Peyr√®re, there must have been two creations; first the creation of the Gentiles and then the creation of Adam, who was the father of the Hebrews. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyr√®re argued, explained Cain's taking of a wife and the building of a city after Abel's murder in the Book of Genesis. Lazslo Toth writing in Politica Hermetica states that \\"racial theory has as its official birthdate 24 April 1684,\\" when Fran√ßois Bernier distinguished four or five races in an article titled A new division of the Earth, according to the different species or races of men who inhabit it published in the Journal des s√ßavans. Because of widespread theological opposition to the pre-Adamite theories of his friend La Peyr√®re, Bernier published his paper anonymously. Age of Enlightenment During the Age of Enlightenment, pre-Adamism was adopted widely as a challenge to the biblical account of human origins. In the 19th century, the idea was welcomed by advocates of white superiority. A number of racist interpretive frameworks involving the early chapters of Genesis arose from pre-Adamism. Some pre- Adamite theorists held the view that Cain left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as \\"nonwhite Mongols\\" or that Cain took a wife from one of the inferior pre-Adamic peoples. 1800‚Äìpresent=Racist pre- Adamism In 19th-century Europe, pre-Adamism was attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, and in the United States, it appealed to those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-whites. Scientists such as Charles Caldwell, Josiah C. Nott and Samuel G. Morton rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with cranial measurements. As Michael Barkun explains: In 1860, Isabella Duncan wrote Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture & Science, a mixture of geology and scriptural interpretation. The book was popular among a number of geologists because it mixed biblical events with science. She suggested that the pre-Adamites are today's angels. Since they were without sin, for sin did not enter the world until Adam disobeyed God, there was no reason for them not to have been at least raptured into heaven, anticipating what would again occur with the second coming of Jesus Christ. Duncan also believed that some angels had sinned and fallen from Heaven, which caused them to become demons. Duncan supposed that such an upheaval would leave geological scars on the earth. The concept of ice ages, pioneered by Louis Agassiz, seemed to provide evidence of such events, drawing the line between the pre-Adamic era and the modern one, which she posited began about 6,000 years ago. (Originally published anonymously, but known subsequently that the author was the wife of George John C. Duncan, the son of Henry Duncan.) Buckner H. Payne, writing under the pen name Ariel, published a pamphlet in 1867 entitled The Negro: What is His Ethnological Status? He insisted that all the sons of Noah had been white. This created a problem then regarding non-white races if the Flood had been universal and the only survivors were white. Payne's solution was to suggest that the Negro is a pre-Adamic beast of the field (specifically, a higher order of monkey), which was preserved on Noah's Ark. According to Payne, they were a separate species without immortal souls. The Irish lawyer Dominick McCausland, a Biblical literalist and anti-Darwinian polemicist, maintained the theory to uphold the Mosaic timescale. He held that the Chinese were descended from Cain and that the \\"Caucasian\\" race would eventually exterminate all others. He maintained that only the \\"Caucasian\\" descendants of Adam were capable of creating civilisation, and he tried to explain away the numerous non-\\"Caucasian\\" civilisations by attributing them all to a vanished \\"Caucasian\\" race, the Hamites. A. Lester Hoyle wrote a book in 1875, The Pre- Adamite, or who tempted Eve? He claimed that there had been five distinct creations of races, and only the fifth, the white race, of which Adam was the father, had been made in God‚Äôs own image and likeness. Hoyle further suggested that Cain was the \\"mongrel offspring\\" of Eve's being seduced by \\"an enticing Mongolian\\" with whom she had repeated trysts, thus laying the foundation for the white supremacist bio-theology that miscegenation was \\"an abomination.\\" In an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre-Adamism, the Vanderbilt University theistic evolutionist and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 tract, Adamites and Preadamites, for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race, on the basis that the Negroes were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God. In 1891, William Campbell, under the pen name \\"Caucasian\\", wrote in Anthropology for the People: A Refutation of the Theory of the Adamic Origin of All Races that the non-white peoples were not descendants of Adam and therefore \\"not brothers in any proper sense of the term, but inferior creations\\" and that polygenism was the \\"only theory reconcilable with scripture.\\" Like Payne before him, Campbell viewed the Great Flood as a consequence of intermarriage between the white (Adamic) and nonwhite (pre-Adamic) peoples \\"the only union we can think of that is reasonable and sufficient to account for the corruption of the world and the consequent judgement.\\" In 1900, Charles Carroll wrote the first of his two books on pre-Adamism, The Negro a Beast; or, In the Image of God in which he sought to revive the ideas previously presented by Buckner H. Payne, describing the Negro as a literal ape rather than human. In a second book published in 1902, The Tempter of Eve, he put forth the idea that the serpent was actually a black female, and that miscegenation was the greatest of all sins. Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races, such as blacks, did not have souls. He believed that race mixing was an insult to God and spoiled God's racial plan of creation, and that the mixing of races had led to the errors of atheism and evolution. The Scottish millennialist George Dickison wrote The Mosaic Account of Creation, As Unfolded in Genesis, Verified by Science in 1902. The book mixed science with a scientifically enhanced reading of Genesis and lists geological discoveries that showed that men existed before Adam had been created and that Earth was much older than the 6000-year-old span of the Adamic race. Dickison welcomed scientific discoveries from fossil evidence and the palaontological record and used them as evidence for pre-Adamism. The doctrine known as British Israelism, which developed in England in the 19th century, also sometimes included a pre-Adamic worldview but that was a minority position. The model viewed pre-Adamites as a race of inferior bestial creatures apart from Adam, who was the first white man and consequently the first son of God. In the narrative, Satan seduces Eve, and the resulting offspring is a hybrid creature, Cain. Later, Cain flees to East Turkestan to establish a colony of followers intent on realizing the Devil‚Äôs plan for domination of the earth. A further elaboration of this myth involved the identification of the Jews with the Canaanites, the putative descendants of Cain, but the eponymous ancestor of the Canaanites is not Cain but Canaan. It followed that if the tribes of Judah were supposed to have intermarried with Cain‚Äôs descendants, the Jews were both the offspring of Satan and the descendants of sundry nonwhite pre-Adamic races. In the United States, philo- Semitic British Israelism developed into the anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement and the serpent seed doctrine. Identity preacher Conrad Gaard wrote that the serpent was a \\"beast of the field,\\" was the father of Cain, and since Cain married a pre-Adamite, his descendants were a \\"mongrel, hybrid race.\\" Non-racist pre-Adamism The occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph published Pre-Adamite Man: Demonstrating The Existence of the Human Race Upon the Earth 100,000 Thousand Years Ago! under the name Griffin Lee in 1863. The book took a primarily scientific view of pre-Adamism, relying on evidence from linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, and ancient history. Being a polygenist, Randolph argued that the color of races, particularly black, was not the result of climate and was proof of separate, pre-Adamite origins. Pre-Adamite theories have also been held by a number of mainstream Christians such as the Congregational evangelist R. A. Torrey (1856‚Äì1928), who believed in the Gap Theory. Torrey believed it was possible to accept both evolution and biblical infallibility, with the pre-Adamite as the bridge between religion and science. Gleason Archer, Jr. was a believer in pre- Adamism. In his 1985 book A Survey of Old Testament Introduction he wrote, Archer asserted that only Adam and his descendants were infused with the breath of God and a spiritual nature corresponding to God himself, and that all mankind subsequent to Adam‚Äôs time must have been literally descended from him. Regarding the concept of pre-Adamic races (such as the Cro-Magnon man), he says: \\"They may have been exterminated by God for unknown reasons prior to the creation of the original parent of the present human race.\\" More recently, such ideas have been promoted by Kathryn Kuhlman and Derek Prince among Pentecostals, John Stott among Anglicans, and Old Earth creationist Hugh Ross.

Historical Armenia There are historical records that attest the presence of Jews in pagan Armenia, before the spread of Christianity in the region by St. Gregory the Illuminator in 301 CE/AD. Early medieval Armenian historians, such as Moses Khorenatsi, held that during the conquest of Armenian King Tigranes the Great (95‚Äì55 BC), brought with him 10,000 Jewish captives to the ancient Kingdom of Armenia (which encompassed what is commonly known as Greater Armenia) when he retreated from Judea, because of the Roman attack on Armenia (69 B.C.). Tigranes II invaded Syria, and probably northern Israel as well.Jan Rets√∂, The Arabs in Antiquity: Their History from the Assyrians to the Umayyads, 2003. p. 347. A large Jewish population was settled in Armenia from the 1st century BC. One city in particular, Vartkesavan became an important commercial center.Movses Khorenatsi II, 65 Thus, Armenia's Jewish community was established. Like the rest of Armenia's population, they suffered the consequences of regional powers trying to divide and conquer the country.Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews By 360‚Äì370 AD, there was a massive increase in Jewish Hellenistic immigration into Armenia; many Armenian towns became predominately Jewish. During this period (4th century AD), after the conquest of Armenia by the Sassanid King Shapur II he deported thousands of Jewish families from Persian Armenia and resettled them at Isfahan (modern Iran). Jewish cemetery in Yeghegis, 13th century In 1912 the archaeologist Nikolai Marr announced the discovery in 1910 of a tombstone in the village of Yeghegis that carried a Hebrew inscription.Michael E. Stone, \\"Journal of Jewish Studies\\", 2006, page 108. In 1996 investigations at Yeghegis, in Armenia's province of Vayotz Dzor, discovered the remains of a medieval Jewish cemetery from a previously unknown Jewish community. In 2000, a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem excavated the southern side of the Yeghegis river, opposite the village a Jewish cemetery with 40 gravestones with Hebrew inscriptions dating between 1266 and 1497. One non-Hebrew word in the inscriptions may indicate the origin of the community. Michael Nosonovsky has stated that \\"The word khawajah is of Persian origin and it probably indicates that the Jews who settled in Yeghegis came from Persia and kept Persian as their spoken language. Biblical quotations and Talmudic formulas are evidence of a high learning standard in the community.\\"Yeghegis, International Jewish Cemetery Project ‚Äì International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies A group of Armenian and Israeli archaeologists and historians excavated the site in 2001 and 2002 and found 64 more tombstones. Some are decorated with motifs of the Orbelian kingdom. The archaeological team also found three mills, which the bishop says show that the community had a business because one mill could feed several families. Twenty of these tombstones had inscriptions, all in Hebrew except for two, which were in Aramaic. The oldest dated stone was from 1266 and the latest date was 1336/7. Modern period In 1828, the Russo-Persian War came to an end and Eastern Armenia (currently the Republic of Armenia) was annexed to the Russian Empire with the Treaty of Turkmenchai. Polish and Iranian Jews began arriving, as well as Sabbatarians (Subbotniki, Russian peasants who were banished to the outskirts of Imperial Russia during the reign of Catherine II. They were Judaizing Christians and mostly converted to mainstream Judaism or assimilated). Since 1840 they started creating Ashkenazi and Mizrahi communities respectively in Yerevan. Up to 1924, the Sephardic synagogue, Shiek Mordechai, was a leading institution among the Jewish community. According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, there were some 415 people in Alexandropol (Gyumri) and 204 in Erivan (Yerevan) whose native language was \\"Jewish\\" and significantly smaller numbers elsewhere 6 in Vagharshapat, 15 in Novo-Bayazet. The number of self-reported Jewish- speakers was the following in other Armenian-populated areas of the Russian Empire that now lie outside Armenia: 4 in Shusha (Karabakh), 93 in Elizavetpol (Ganja, Azerbaijan), 4 in Igdir (now Turkey), 424 in Kars (Turkey), 111 in Ardahan (Turkey), 189 in Akhalkalaki (Georgia), 438 in Akhaltsikhe (Georga), 72 in Shulaveri (Georgia). As for Western Armenia (Turkish Armenia), according to official Ottoman figures from 1914, 3,822 Jews lived in the \\"Six vilayets\\" that had significant Armenian population: 2,085 in Diyarbekir Vilayet, 1,383 in Van Vilayet, 344 in Sivas Vilayet, 10 in Erzurum Vilayet, and none in Bitlis and Mamuret-ul-Aziz (Harput). There were further 317 Jews in historical Cilicia: 66 in Adana Vilayet and 251 in Mara≈ü Sanjak. The Russian Jewish communities moved to Armenia on a larger scale during the Soviet period, looking for an atmosphere of tolerance in the area that was absent in the Russian SSR or Ukrainian SSR. Following World War II, the Jewish population rose to approximately 5,000. In 1959, the Jewish population peaked in Soviet Armenia at approximately 10,000 people. Another wave of Jewish immigrants arrived in the country between 1965 and 1972, mainly intelligentsia, military, and engineers. These Jews arrived from Russia and Ukraine, attracted to the more liberal society. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union many of them left due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Between 1992 and 1994, more than 6,000 Jews immigrated to Israel because of Armenia's political isolation and economic depression. Today the country's Jewish population has shrunk to around 750. In 1995, the Chabad House was established in Yerevan. Present day Jewish Holocaust Memorial in Yerevan There are about 300‚Äì500Vandals deface Holocaust memorial in Armenia.

A funnel cloud is usually visible as a cone-shaped or needle like protuberance from the main cloud base. Funnel clouds form most frequently in association with supercell thunderstorms, and are the precursor to tornadoes. Funnel clouds are visual phenomena, these are not the vortex of wind itself. \\"Classic\\" funnel clouds If a funnel cloud touches the surface the feature is considered a tornado, although ground level circulations begin before the visible condensation cloud appears. Most tornadoes begin as funnel clouds, but some funnel clouds do not make surface contact and these cannot be counted as tornadoes from the perspective of a naked eye observer, even as tornadic circulations of some intensity almost always are detectable when low-level radar observations are available. Also, tornadoes occur with some frequency without an associated condensation funnel. The term condensation funnel may refer to either a tornadic cloud or a funnel cloud aloft, but the term funnel cloud exclusively refers to a rotating condensation funnel not reaching the surface. If strong cyclonic winds are occurring at the surface and are connected to a cloud base, regardless of condensation, then the feature is a tornado. Debris swirls are usually evident prior to the condensation funnel reaching the surface. Some tornadoes may appear only as a debris swirl, with no obvious funnel cloud extending below the rotating cloud base at any time during the tornadic life cycle. The surface level vortex tends to strengthen over time following initial formation, making the debris swirls and the condensation more apparent. In cloud nomenclature, any funnel- or inverted- funnel-shaped cloud descending from cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds is technically described as an accessory feature called tuba. The terms tuba and funnel cloud are nearly but not exactly synonymous; a wall cloud, for example, is also a form of tuba. Funnel clouds associated with supercells usually form within and under wall clouds. Cold-air funnel clouds Cold-air funnel clouds (vortices) are generally much weaker than the vortices produced by supercells. Although cold-air funnels rarely make ground contact, surface level vortices sometimes become strong enough for condensation cloud to \\"touch down\\" briefly, becoming visible as weak tornadoes or waterspouts. A shear funnel extending from a cumulus humilis cloud, which was observed in northern Texas during the first VORTEX project. Unlike the related phenomenon associated with severe thunderstorms, cold-air funnels are generally associated with partly cloudy skies in the wake of cold fronts, especially associated with certain low pressure systems, or in association with atmospheric boundaries such as lake and sea breezes or outflow boundaries. The larger scale weather conditions are characterized by particularly cold air aloft over relatively warmer low level air, leading to high lapse rates, and often by high environmental vorticity yet relatively meager vertical wind shear. The funnels develop where atmospheric instability and moisture are sufficient to support towering cumulus clouds but typically limited to no or to little precipitation. Cold-air funnels, although weak, may persist for several minutes, and areas of intermittently forming funnel clouds may occur for tens of minutes. Multiple such areas of activity may form within the same region during afternoon heating. Cold-air funnels appears to be a diurnal phenomenon, weakening and eventually dissipating with loss of solar heating. When precipitation does develop, the associated downdraft tends to cause rapid demise of the cold-air funnels. The mixing of cooler air in the lower troposphere with air flowing in a different direction in the middle troposphere causes the rotation on a horizontal axis, which, when deflected and tightened vertically by convective updrafts, forms a vertical rotation that can cause condensation to form a funnel cloud.Cooley J. R., and M. E. Soderberg, 1973: Cold air funnel clouds. NOAA Tech. Memo. NWS CR-52, Scientific Services Division, NWS Central Region, Kansas City, MO, 29 pp. Cold-air funnel clouds are a common sight along the Pacific Coast of the United States, particularly in the spring or fall. On July 29, 2013, a cold- core funnel cloud touched down as an EF0 tornado in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, causing extensive damage in the form of downed trees on a golf course. No advance weather watches or warnings were issued by Environment Canada, and the tornado was spawned from one of the few non-severe storm clouds moving through the area.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2013/07/30/ottawa-funnel- clouds-storm-video.html Other funnel clouds Other funnel clouds include shear or \\"high based\\" funnels, which are ephemeral, small, and weak funnels associated with small cumulus clouds, often even those rooted aloft above the boundary or surface layer, and in \\"fair weather\\" conditions. Small funnel clouds, such as some occurring within vicinity of mountains, occur by unknown processes. Shear funnels might also occur with weak transient circulations at the cloud base of thunderstorms. Mesoanticyclones, which accompany mesocyclones, often exhibit these funnel clouds. Brief funnels also are observed with some rear flank downdrafts (RFDs) (within inflow or outflow areas, and especially within inflow-outflow interchange areas as RFDs interact with mesocyclones or flanking line updrafts) and streamwise vorticity currents (SVCs) feeding into mesocyclones. Although not considered a separate kind of funnel cloud, some funnel clouds form with mesovortices associated with squall lines, which also can become tornadoes but are often not visible as funnel clouds or tornadoes because they usually occur within obscuring precipitation. Other \\"fair weather\\" funnel clouds include horseshoe clouds which are a very transient phenomena associated with extremely weak vortices.

It is defined in dictionary as a building type found in Southeast Asia that is \\"a shop opening on to the pavement and also used as the owner's residence\\", and became a commonly used term since the 1950s. Variations of the shophouse may also be found in other parts of the world; in Southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau, it is found in a building type known as Tong lau, and in towns and cities in Sri Lanka. They stand in a terraced house configuration, often fronted with arcades or colonnades, which present a unique townscape in Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and south China.  Design and features  Shophouse prototype * Site and plan: Shophouses were a convenient design for urban settlers, providing both a residence and small business venue. Shophouses were often designed to be narrow and deep so that many businesses can be accommodated along a street. Each building's footprint was narrow in width and long in depth. The front area along the street was formal space for customers, while the rear areas were informal spaces for family members, toilets, bathrooms, kitchens, and infrastructure. * Veranda: Merchandise was displayed in front of the house, and was protected by a veranda from rain and sunshine. The veranda also served as reception for customers. The veranda along the street was an important area for the house owner and customers. Unless there was a communal arrangement, verandas may not connected to each other to form continuous colonnades. Where the colonnades are present by design, they form the five foot way. * Courtyard and upper floor: Traditional shophouses may have between one and three floors. The shophouse was usually built between parallel masonry party walls. The upper part of the house was used as living quarters. To ensure air circulation, an inner \\"courtyard\\" (air-well) was placed midway between the front and rear of the house. File:Shophouse- quanzhou.jpgShophouse, Quanzhou, China, 1992.

Covered walkways  A five-foot way in Singapore In 1822, instructions were issued by Sir Stamford Raffles for the Town Plan of Singapore which specified that each house had to provide a \\"verandah of a certain depth, open at all times as a continued and covered passage on each side of the street\\". Raffles' instructions created a regular and uniform townscape in Singapore with arcades or colonnades forming a continuous public pathways. Later in other Straits Settlements, the \\"continued covered passage\\" known as \\"five foot way\\" was also mandated, and it became a distinctive feature of the \\"Strait Settlement Style\\" buildings. This feature also spread to other South East Asian countries after the mid-19th century such as Thailand and the Philippines, as well as some East Asian countries. Covered walkways are found in a building type called qilou found in Southern China, Taiwan and Hong Kong that was developed under the influence of Singaporean shophouses. In Taipei at the end of the Qing dynasty period, Taiwan under the Taiwan under Japanese rule, and in Southern China under the Republic of China, similar regulations were applied, mandating a wider space. In 1876, the Hong Kong colonial authority allowed the lease holder to build overhangs above the verandah (public sidewalk in Hong Kong colony) to provide more living space with no intention of creating regular and uniform townscapes.

The facade ornamentation draws inspiration from the Chinese, European, and Malay traditions, but with the European elements dominant. European neo-classical motifs include egg-and-dart moldings, and Ionic or Corinthian capitals on decorative pilasters. The degree of a shophouse's ornamentation depended on the prosperity of its owner and the surrounding area; shophouse facades in cities and (former) boom towns are generally more elaborate than spartan rural shophouses. Masonry-heavy Art Deco and Streamline Moderne styles eventually prevailed between the 1930s and 1950s. Modern variations through the 1950s up to the 1980s were devoid of ornamental decorations, and tended to be designed with imposing geometrical and utilitarian forms inspired by International and Brutalist styles. Beginning in the 1990s, buildings began to adopt postmodern and revival styles.

The ground floor may serve as food and drink shops, offices, shops, or workshops. If the ground floor include living spaces (usually located at the back), it may be used as reception, guestrooms, and formal family rooms with ancestor altars. As the settlement prospered and population increased, some front shops were put to professional uses such as clinics, drugstores, law offices, pawnshops, travel agencies. Food and drink shops usually served economical selections, such as a variety of ready-cooked food of Chinese style, Padang style (Halal), or Siamese style. Cooking stalls rented a portion of space from the shop owner and served specific food such as fried noodles, fried rice, Indian pancakes, noodle soup. A variety of drinks was served by a different stall, sometimes by the shop owner. Such stalls have been replaced by food courts. Street corners were prized as the best location for food and drink shops. Street corner, Georgetown, Penang, 1990. Semarang- Pecinan-Shophouse5.jpgShophouse, Pecinan, Semarang, 1991.

The frame structure of the shophouses is clearly visible on the exposed right wall. The width of each shophouse is equal to the separation of two piers. Modern shophouses are made of reinforced concrete. Loads are carried by beams and piers, built on a grid system. The spacing of the piers is determined by economic factors: wider beams require larger amounts of steel. A plot of land that measures 40 m wide and 12 m deep, could be used to create 10 shophouses, each measuring 4 m x 12 m, or eight shophouses measuring 5 m x 12 m, or something in between. Walls are infill, which means that a row of shophouses can easily be reconfigured, to allow a business to occupy two or more shophouses, by simply removing the dividing walls. A row of shophouses can be built in stages by exposing around 50‚Äì60 cm of rebar in the left-right beams at each end of the row. When continuing construction, new rebar is tied to the existing rebar to allow the beam to be continued, thereby removing the need for new structural piers.  Singapore shophouses  The shophouses of Singapore evolved from the early-19th century during the colonial era. It was first introduced by Stamford Raffles who specified in his Town Plan for Singapore the uniformity and regularity of the building, the material used as well as features of the buildings such as a covered passageway. After the colonial era, shophouses became old and dilapidated, leading to a fraction of them abandoned or razed (by demolition work or, on occasion, fire). In Singapore, the Land Acquisition Act for urban development, passed during the early-1960s and amended in 1973, affected owners of shophouses and worked a significant compensatory unfairness upon them when their shophouses were seized to satisfy redevelopment efforts. Over the decades, entire blocks of historical shophouses in the urban centre were leveled for high-density developments or governmental facilities. Owners and occupants of colonial shophouses in Malaysia underwent different experiences involving a series of rent control legislation put in place between 1956 and 1966. Under the most recent 1966 Control of Rent Act, privately owned buildings constructed before 1948, including scores of shophouses, were subjected to rent price controls to alleviate housing shortages, Retrieved 2015-3-6 with the intent of providing the increasingly urbanised population with sufficient affordable housing. In the decades following the introduction of the act in 1966, development of sites that the shophouses rest on were often unprofitable due to poor rental takings, leading to historical urban districts stagnating but being effectively preserved, although entire blocks of shophouses were known to be demolished for a variety of reasons during the upsurge of the economy (from government acquisitions to destruction from fires). With the repeal of the act in 1997, landowners were eventually granted authority to determine rent levels and be enticed to develop or sell off pre-1948 shophouses; as a result, poorer tenants were priced out and many of the buildings were extensively altered or demolished for redevelopment over the course of the 2000s and 2010s. Shophouses have also been documented to be illegally sealed for use to cultivate and harvest edible bird's nests, leading to long-term internal damage of the buildings. Many shophouses in Singapore that escaped the effects of the Land Acquisition Act have now undergone a revival of sorts, with some restored and renovated as budget hotels, tea houses, and cinemas. Some shophouses are now considered architectural landmarks and have substantially increased in value. In 2011 in Singapore, two of every three shophouse units sold for between S$1.7‚Äì5.5 million (US$1.4‚Äì4.4 million), while larger units sold for between S$10‚Äì12.5 million (US$8‚Äì10 million), a sharp increase from 2010, while average per-square-foot prices increased 21% from 2010. The median price in Singapore in 2011 was 74% higher than in 2007. Pre-war shophouses in Bugis's Tan Quee Lan Street. February 2019.jpgPre-war shophouses in Bugis's Tan Quee Lan Street.

Heritage shophouses  While the preservation of historic shophouses has suffered substantially in heavily developed states like Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, and Selangor, shophouses in Malacca and Penang (which state capitals, Malacca Town and George Town, have been gazetted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2008) received more care and attention due to emerging historical preservation movements in both states, experiencing similar levels of rejuvenation as in Singapore. However, the gentrification of both cities has led to older tenants of shophouses being driven out by the rising costs of renting or buying properties within historical districts. In 2012, the cost of buying a pre- World War II shophouse in George Town reached RM2,000 per square foot (US$660), equivalent to the price of the most expensive Kuala Lumpur city centre condominium units.

PSA Corporation Limited (simplified Chinese: Êñ∞Âä†Âù°Ê∏ØÂä°ÈõÜÂõ¢) was thus corporatised on 1 October 1997. The company kept the initials ‚ÄúPSA‚Äù as its brand name but it is no longer an acronym. The regulatory functions of the former authority were transferred to Singapore's new maritime regulator, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). In order to focus on its core port business, PSA Corporation set up The HarbourFront Limited (present day Mapletree) on 7 December 2000 to spearhead development of its properties. Following a restructuring exercise in December 2003, PSA International Pte Ltd (simplified Chinese: PSAÂõΩÈôÖÊ∏ØÂä°ÈõÜÂõ¢) became the holding company for the PSA Group of companies with PSA Singapore as one of its flagship terminals.

The Man Who Had All the Luck follows protagonist David Beeves‚Äô existential exploration into the enigmatic question of how fate and the human will interact with each other. The play takes on a fantastical, parable-like architecture in its plot construction and character development as we follow Beeves into three and a half of the luckiest years of his life. The story begins during an evening in April at an undisclosed Midwestern town, evoking a feel of nostalgia and Americana in the process. The Man Who Had All the Luck failed on Broadway, lasting only four performances. Afterwards, Miller wrote All My Sons as a final attempt at writing a commercially successful play; he had vowed to \\"find some other line of work\\" if the play did not find an audience.  Plot  David Beeves is a young Midwestern automobile mechanic who discovers he is blessed with what appears to be almost supernatural good fortune that allows him to overcome every seemingly insurmountable obstacle that crosses his path while those around him fall in defeat. Like Midas, everything he touches is tinged with gold, leaving him to wonder if and when his luck will change and he too will be forced to deal with life's tragedies, until he eventually realizes that his good heart, hard work, and quick thought have been responsible for his success far more than luck. David Beeves works as a self- taught auto mechanic in a barn that doubles as a repair station ‚Äì this is where the entire first act takes place. The scene unfolds as David tells J.B., a local shop owner, that he plans to confront his girlfriend Hester‚Äôs father about their intention to marry. This, of course, is not as easy as it seems; her father, Andrew Falk, has resented David for over seven years and still controls every aspect of Hester‚Äôs life. After receiving conflicting advice on how to mediate the situation from J.B., Hester, his father Pat, and Shory (a disabled veteran who manages the feed and grain store adjacent to the barn), a rich farm owner named Dan Dibble brings his Marmon over for repair after a competing mechanic informs him that the engine will have to be taken apart. J.B. then notes to David in secrecy that getting the Marmon to run properly might cement his place in the tractor business, despite David‚Äôs lack of prowess in tractor repair. David agrees to the job with brisk charm, though is filled with doubt about his ability to diagnose the Marmon properly. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Falk arrives in a bitter frustration, ordering Hester to return home and confronting David Beeves directly. David, restraining himself from rash emotion and violence, bluntly tells Falk that he and Hester are marrying. Falk subsequently threatens to kill Beeves if he sees him again and pushes his stalled car away. Only moments later Dan Dibble returns with Hester, admitting in a stunned confession that he accidentally hit and killed her father with the front of his vehicle. David, feeling an ambivalent combination of sympathy for Hester, elation now that his obstacles have been removed, and a skeptical notion that what just happened was unreal, stays in the barn to work on the Marmon. As time presses on, Beeves gets progressively more tired and frustrated with his incompetence in diagnosing the Marmon‚Äôs mechanical issues. At the brink of his exhaustion, an Austrian mechanic named Gus enters the barn and offers to fix the Marmon at no charge while David rests. When he awakes in the morning, Gus has disappeared and Dibble has returned. Assuming that David was the one who repaired the automobile, Dibble promises to bring all of his tractors that need work done to David in the future, and guarantees the forming of other business connections along the way. In utter disbelief of his luck, David is unable to accept the money for restoring the Marmon. The play resumes following a three-year lapse at the farmhouse David and Hester have inherited after Andrew Falk‚Äôs death. David‚Äôs close friends and family have gathered at the house, eagerly awaiting his brother Amos‚Äôs baseball game. It is later revealed that Pat has received a telegram from Augie Belfast, a talent scout for the Detroit Tigers, notifying the family that he will be watching the game tonight specifically for Amos. After they return from the game, the crowd awaits Belfast‚Äôs arrival and verdict on whether Amos has the skill to be drafted into the Major Leagues at the Beeves‚Äô residence. During this brief interim, David decides to invest in a mink farm at the persuasion of Dan Dibble. Spirits are high within the group initially, but as time passes without any sign of Belfast, Beeves starts to doubt the value of man‚Äôs hard work and determination. When the man ultimately does show, he lauds Amos‚Äôs talent as a pitcher, but remarks that when the bases are loaded, he becomes panicky because he has been used to practicing in the cellar throughout his life. He leaves the house unwilling to make any sort of deal with Amos. Resentful and humiliated, Amos vows never to play baseball again, blames his father for his misfortunes, and discloses his envious feelings toward David‚Äôs fulfillment in life. Beeves tells him he is not fulfilled in life because of his perceived inability to have children, which spurs Hester to unexpectedly reveal that she is having a child. Several months pass, and Hester has begun to enter labor as David, J.B., Shory, and Gus wait downstairs for the child to be born. Beeves tries to convince Gus to take over sixty percent of his business ventures so he can raise enough money to purchase more mink. Gus refuses on the basis that David could lose everything he owns if his mink perish, to which he replies that he has already mortgaged most of his assets. As things escalate into quarrel, David divulges that Hester has fallen and that it is possible that the child could be delivered as a stillbirth or deformed. David is convinced that this catastrophe is his final payment for all of the luck that has pursued him throughout his recent life. Ironically, the child is born a healthy boy, and David continues to feel ashamed and guilty about his prosperity. A month later, Gus and Hester learn that Dan Dibble‚Äôs mink have all died after consuming contaminated feed ‚Äì David uses the same feed for his own mink. Both decide to hold off on telling him; Gus fearing that his psychological and emotional stability might come into jeopardy, and Hester believing that such a loss would eventually make him happy in the long run. Dibble eventually calls the house and informs David, who begins to chastise Hester. She makes the decision to leave him, the reasoning behind this misconstrued by David as Gus having an affair with his wife. Just as things come to an emotional climax, Dibble arrives and assuages their fears ‚Äì he and David both realize that the careful monitoring of the feed has saved his mink. David has an epiphany after Gus points out that only Beeves‚Äô hard work and meticulous care giving could have saved the mink, not luck. He then departs. Hester asks David to come up for bed, and as thunder roars in the distance, he stares out the window with apprehension.  Analysis  Christopher Bigsby states that this is a study of human freedom. Beyond offering an account of a man's decline into madness, and eventual redemption, it explores the degree to which many of the characters become complicit in their own irrelevance, the degree to which they collude in the idea of man as a victim, as a subject of cosmic ironies.\\"  Production History  Although written in 1940, the play did not reach New York City until four years later, Miller's first to be mounted on Broadway. Directed by Joseph Fields, it opened on November 23, 1944 at the Forrest Theatre, where it ran for only 4 performances. Karl Swenson starred as David Beeves. The play's failure nearly derailed Miller's career, and it remained one of his least known works until 1990, when the Bristol Old Vic staged The Man Who Had All The Luck with Iain Glen in the lead role. The production was directed by Paul Unwin. It later transferred to the Young Vic in London. In 2000 director Dan Fields mounted a production that ran for seven weeks at the Ivy Substation theater in Culver City, California. The following year, a production was staged by the Williamstown Theatre Festival, which had presented the American premiere of Miller's The Ride Down Mt. Morgan. After fifteen previews, a Broadway revival directed by Scott Ellis opened on May 1, 2002 at the American Airlines Theatre, where it ran for 62 performances. The cast included Chris O'Donnell as David Beeves, with Samantha Mathis, Mason Adams, James Rebhorn, Richard Riehle, David Wohl, and Sam Robards, whose performance garnered him Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 2006, it was announced Ellis was directing a feature film adaptation of the play. The play was revived at the Donmar Warehouse, London, in March 2008 in a production by Sean Holmes. The 25th of September 2012 saw the start of a UK wide tour by Sell A Door Theatre Company, in association with Mull Theatre. The tour is directed by David Hutchinson and designed by Richard Evans. The tour took in the whole of the UK from Orkney Arts Theatre to Greenwich Theatre, London.

A bootlegger and close associate of gambler Arnold Rothstein, Diamond survived a number of attempts on his life between 1916 and 1931, causing him to be known as the \\"clay pigeon of the underworld\\". In 1930, Diamond's nemesis Dutch Schultz remarked to his own gang, \\"Ain't there nobody that can shoot this guy so he don't bounce back?\\" Early life Diamond was born July 10, 1897, to Sara and John Diamond, who emigrated from Ireland in 1891 to Philadelphia, USA. In 1899, Jack's younger brother Eddie Diamond was born. Jack and Eddie both struggled through grade school, while Sara suffered from severe arthritis and other health problems. On December 24, 1913, Sara died from complications due to a bacterial infection and high fever. John Diamond, Sr. moved to Brooklyn shortly afterwards. Diamond soon joined a New York street gang called the Hudson Dusters. Diamond's first arrest for burglary occurred when he broke into a jewelry store on February 4, 1914, with numerous arrests following throughout the rest of his life. Diamond served in the U.S. Army during World War I, but deserted in 1918 or 1919, then was convicted and jailed for desertion. Once free of jail, Diamond became a thug and later personal bodyguard for Arnold Rothstein in 1919. On October 16, 1927 Diamond tried to stop the murder of \\"Little Augie\\" (Jacob Orgen). Diamond's brother Eddie was Orgen's bodyguard, but Legs Diamond substituted for Eddie that day. As Orgen and Diamond were walking down a street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, three young men approached them and started shooting. Orgen was fatally wounded and Diamond was shot two times below the heart. Diamond was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he eventually recovered. The police interviewed Diamond in the hospital, but he refused to identify any suspects or help the investigation in any way. The police initially suspected that Diamond was an accomplice and charged him with homicide, but the charge was later dropped. The assailants were supposedly hired by Louis Buchalter and Gurrah Shapiro, who were seeking to move in on Orgen's garment-district labor rackets. Lifestyle Diamond was known for leading a rather flamboyant lifestyle. He was a very energetic individual; his nickname \\"Legs\\" derived either from his being a good dancer or from how fast he could escape his enemies. His wife Alice was never supportive of his lifestyle, but did not do much to dissuade him from it. Diamond was a womanizer; his best known mistress was showgirl and dancer Marion \\"Kiki\\" Roberts. The public loved Diamond; he was Upstate New York's biggest celebrity at the time. Prohibition and the Manhattan Bootleg Wars During the late 1920s, Prohibition was in force, and the sale of beer and other alcohol was illegal in the United States. Diamond traveled to Europe to acquire beer and narcotics, but failed. He did obtain liquor, which was dumped overboard in partially full barrels, which floated onto Long Island, as ships entered New York. He paid the children a nickel for every barrel they brought to his trucks. Following Orgen's death, Diamond went to work overseeing bootleg alcohol sales in downtown Manhattan. That brought him into conflict with Dutch Schultz, who wanted to move beyond his base in Harlem. He also ran into trouble with other gangs in the city. In 1930, Diamond and two henchmen kidnapped Grover Parks, a truck driver in Cairo, New York, and demanded to know where he had obtained his load of hard cider. When Parks denied carrying anything, Diamond and his men beat and tortured Parks, eventually letting him go. A few months later, Diamond was charged with the kidnapping of James Duncan. He was sent to Catskill, New York, for his first trial, but was acquitted. However, he was convicted in a federal case on related charges, and sentenced to four years in jail. In a third trial, in Troy, New York, he was acquitted. Trip to Europe In late August, 1930, Diamond boarded the ocean liner Belgenland in New York for a voyage to Antwerp, Belgium. He told reporters that his final destination was Vichy in France, where he would take a \\"cure\\" of the mineral waters for his health. However, the real reason was to look for sources of rye whiskey in Germany to illegally import into the United States. During the trip, Diamond allegedly won several thousand dollars in poker games with other passengers, who treated him like a celebrity. However, as soon as Diamond left the Belgenland, he was taken by Antwerp police to their headquarters. At the end of the day, Diamond agreed to voluntarily leave the country and was put on a train to Germany. When Diamond's train reached the town of Aachen in Germany, agents of the German secret service arrested him. On September 6, the German government decided to deport Diamond. He was driven to Hamburg and placed on the freighter Hannover for passage to Philadelphia. On September 23, the Hannover arrived in Philadelphia and Diamond was immediately arrested by Philadelphia Police Department officers. At a court hearing that day, the judge said he would release Diamond if he left Philadelphia within the hour. Diamond agreed. Assassination and prosecution attempts On October 12, 1930, Diamond was shot and wounded at the Hotel Monticello on the west side of Manhattan. Two men forced their way into Diamond's room and shot him five times before fleeing. Still in his pajamas, Diamond staggered into the hallway and collapsed. When asked later by the New York Police Commissioner how he managed to walk out of the room, Diamond said he drank two shots of whiskey first. Diamond was rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan, where he eventually recovered. On December 30, 1930, Diamond was discharged from Polyclinic. On April 21, 1931, Diamond was arrested in Catskill, New York on assault charges for the Parks beating in 1930. Two days later, he was released from the county jail on $25,000 bond. On April 27, 1931, Diamond was again shot and wounded, this time at the Aratoga Inn, a road house near Cairo, New York. After eating in the dining room with three companions, Diamond walked out to the front door. He was shot three times, and collapsed by the door. A local resident drove Diamond to a hospital in Albany, New York, where he eventually recovered. On May 1, while Diamond was still in the hospital, New York State Troopers seized over $5,000 worth of illegal beer and alcohol from Diamond's hiding places in Cairo and at the Aratoga Inn. In August 1931, Diamond and Paul Quattrocchi went on trial for bootlegging. That same month, Diamond was convicted and sentenced to four years in state prison. In September 1931, Diamond appealed his conviction. Death alt=A narrow brick building with dark brown steps leading to the main entrance. Most of the upper two stories are obscured by a tree On December 18, 1931, Diamond's enemies finally caught up with him. Diamond had been staying in a rooming house in Albany, New York while on trial in Troy, New York, on kidnapping charges. On December 17, Diamond was acquitted. That night, Diamond, his family and friends were at a restaurant. At 1:00 a.m., Diamond went to visit his mistress, Marion \\"Kiki\\" Roberts. At 4:30 a.m., Diamond went back to the rooming house and passed out on his bed. Two gunmen entered his room around an hour later. One man held down Diamond while the other shot him three times in the back of the head. There has been much speculation as to who was responsible for the murder; likely candidates include Dutch Schultz, the Oley Brothers (local thugs), the Albany Police Department, and relatives of Red Cassidy, another Irish American gangster at the time. According to William Kennedy's O Albany, Democratic Party Chairman Dan O'Connell, who ran the local political machine, ordered Diamond's execution, which was carried out by the Albany Police. The following are Dan O'Connell's own words recorded during a 1974 interview by Kennedy and appear on pages 203 and 204: > In order for the Mafia to move in they had to have protection, and they know > they'll never get it in this town. We settled that years ago. Legs Diamond > [...] called up one day and said he wanted to go into the 'insurance' > business here. He was going to sell strong-arm 'protection' to the > merchants. I sent word to him that he wasn't going to do any business in > Albany and we didn't expect to see him in town the next morning. He never > started anything here. Prior brought him around here [...] but brought him > around once too often. Fitzpatrick finished Legs. O'Connell added that > William Fitzpatrick (a police sergeant at the time and later chief) and > Diamond were \\"sitting in the same room and (Fitzpatrick) followed him out. > Fitzpatrick told him he'd kill him if he didn't keep going. Given the power that the O'Connell machine held in Albany and their determination to prevent organized crime, other than their own, from establishing itself in the city and threatening their monopoly of vice, most people accept this account of the story. In addition, it has been confirmed by other former machine officials. Fitzpatrick's promotion to Chief of Police was believed to have been a reward for executing Diamond. In 1945, Chief Fitzpatrick himself was shot and killed in his own office by an Albany police detective, John McElveney. Detective McElveney was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He was released in 1957, when his sentence was commuted by Governor W. Averell Harriman. On December 23, 1931, Jack Diamond was buried at Mt Olivet Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens. There was no church service or graveside ceremony. Two hundred family and spectators attended Diamond's interment; no criminal figures were spotted. On July 1, 1933, Diamond's widow, Alice Kenny Diamond, was found shot to death in her Brooklyn apartment. It was speculated that she was shot by Diamond's enemies to keep her quiet.

Little Cornwallis Island was the home to Polaris Mine, the most poleward base-metal mine in the world. In 1960 a vast concentration of zinc and lead was discovered on the island during mapping for oil permits. Cominco acquired land in the area and a gravity survey in 1970 detected a large anomaly. By 1973 surface drilling and underground development had outlined the Polaris ore body and defined reserves of about 25 million tons grading approximately 14% zinc and 4% lead. A mining facility was constructed on a barge at Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec and towed to the island; arriving in mid August 1981. Production commenced in 1982. The mile-long gravel runway allowed aircraft as large as the Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 to service the mine. The mine was closed in August 2002 as forecast due to depletion of the ore body. From 1982-2002 the mine processed 21 million tons of ore grading 3.72% lead and 15.81% zinc, producing 733,800 tons of lead metal and 2.8 million tons of zinc metal in concentrate. A two-year, $53 million decommissioning and reclamation program was completed in September 2004.

Richmond Power Station was a Victorian era coal fired power station which operated on the banks of the Yarra River in Richmond, Victoria, Australia from its construction in 1891 until its closure in 1976.

It has since been converted into office space and is the headquarters of international fashion brand Country Road and advertising agency CHE Proximity.http://www.che.com.au The area in which it is located is now called Cremorne. The former power station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. History The Richmond Power Station was completed in 1891 by the New Australian Lighting and Traction Company. It was one of the first alternating current (AC) electricity generation plants in Victoria. The building was designed by Charles D'Ebro, one of Melbourne's premier architects of the time. Initially the station provided power to Melbourne and the suburbs of Richmond, Prahran and South Melbourne. The main competitor was A.U. Alcock's Electric Light and Motive Power Company. Early equipment was a 750 kW Elwell-Parker alternator. Power was supplied at 2 kV and 97 Hz. The set was driven by a Robey compound steam engine rated at . In 1899, the two companies were taken over by Brush Electrical and were combined to form the Electric Lighting and Traction Company of Australia. In 1901, two Brush-Universal 500 kW sets were added. As demand increased, the plant went through a series of upgrades, the first being an expansion to the engine house. In 1905, the first of two Parsons-Brush 1 MW single-phase turbo- alternators, with a terminal voltage of 4.2 kV, were added. A Curtis-Thompson 1.5 MW turbo alternator was bought in 1907. The company's name was changed in 1908 to The Melbourne Electric Supply Company Limited. In 1910, two Belliss and Morcom high-speed triple-expansion engines, coupled to Brush alternators, were added. Another four turbo alternators were installed from 1911 onwards, with the engine room extended to the east to accommodate the 10MW increase in power output. Also, several Babcock & Wilcox boilers were added in 1912, and a new chimney stack was built in 1913. In 1919, a second chimney stack was erected, and in 1922, a second floor was added to the office block. By 1924, installed capacity had increased to 17 MW. In 1929, the station was taken over by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which relegated Richmond to a peak-load facility. A 15 MW turbo-alternator was installed on the site of the older plant in 1930. That machine ran at 3000 RPM at 6.6 kV at 50 Hz. It was of great value to Melbourne during the power shortages of the 1950s and was still in service in the 1960s. After World War II, Melbourne experienced severe power shortages. There was no way of procuring steam plant from the usual English manufactures for several years, but a Swiss firm came to the rescue in 1950. A Brown Boveri three-cylinder steam turbo alternator, with a capacity of 38 MW, was installed. That plant was very cheap to run in the 1950s with of steam supplied by each of the two Velox oil-fired boilers, at and . Although obsolete by the 1970s, the station continued to operate very reliably as a peak-load plant until 1982, when its inefficiency, dilapidated condition and pollution led to its closure. Redevelopment The building lay derelict in a large pocket of SECV owned land for many years. Its chimney stacks were demolished soon after closure due to structural faults. It was a popular location for film and television makers during this time. Some scenes for Bangkok Hilton were shot there, some of which incongruously showed the Bryant and May Factory in the background, as were scenes for the police drama Phoenix. In the early 1990s, Victoria's electricity industry was privatised by the Kennett Liberal State Government. This saw this the sale of much of the SECV's surplus assets. The station and surrounding buildings were sold for development as an office park. All surrounding buildings, most of which dated from the 1930s and 1940s were demolished. Under architects Metier 3 the original station building and turbine hall, which is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register was restored with a modern extension added to the section which formerly housed the old Babcock + Wilcox water tube boilers. The building, designed for Country Road, won a merit award from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1997. The area around the station has also been fully developed.

In operator terms, if * F1 and F2 are the 1- and 2-dimensional Fourier transform operators mentioned above, * P1 is the projection operator (which projects a 2-D function onto a 1-D line), * S1 is a slice operator (which extracts a 1-D central slice from a function), then : F_1 P_1 = S_1 F_2. This idea can be extended to higher dimensions. This theorem is used, for example, in the analysis of medical CT scans where a \\"projection\\" is an x-ray image of an internal organ. The Fourier transforms of these images are seen to be slices through the Fourier transform of the 3-dimensional density of the internal organ, and these slices can be interpolated to build up a complete Fourier transform of that density. The inverse Fourier transform is then used to recover the 3-dimensional density of the object. This technique was first derived by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1956 for a radio-astronomy problem.  The projection-slice theorem in N dimensions  In N dimensions, the projection- slice theorem states that the Fourier transform of the projection of an N-dimensional function f(r) onto an m-dimensional linear submanifold is equal to an m-dimensional slice of the N-dimensional Fourier transform of that function consisting of an m-dimensional linear submanifold through the origin in the Fourier space which is parallel to the projection submanifold. In operator terms: :F_mP_m=S_mF_N.\\\\, The generalized Fourier-slice theorem In addition to generalizing to N dimensions, the projection-slice theorem can be further generalized with an arbitrary change of basis. For convenience of notation, we consider the change of basis to be represented as B, an N-by-N invertible matrix operating on N-dimensional column vectors. Then the generalized Fourier-slice theorem can be stated as : F_m P_m B = S_m \\\\frac{B^{-T}}{B^{-T}} F_N.  Proof in two dimensions  A graphical illustration of the projection slice theorem in two dimensions. f(r) and F(k) are 2-dimensional Fourier transform pairs. The projection of f(r) onto the x-axis is the integral of f(r) along lines of sight parallel to the y-axis and is labelled p(x). The slice through F(k) is on the kx axis, which is parallel to the x axis and labelled s(kx). The projection-slice theorem states that p(x) and s(kx) are 1-dimensional Fourier transform pairs. The projection-slice theorem is easily proven for the case of two dimensions. Without loss of generality, we can take the projection line to be the x-axis. There is no loss of generality because if we use a shifted and rotated line, the law still applies. Using a shifted line (in y) gives the same projection and therefore the same 1D Fourier transform results. The rotated function is the Fourier pair of the rotated Fourier transform, for which the theorem again holds. If f(x, y) is a two-dimensional function, then the projection of f(x, y) onto the x axis is p(x) where :p(x)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x,y)\\\\,dy. The Fourier transform of f(x,y) is : F(k_x,k_y)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x,y)\\\\,e^{-2\\\\pi i(xk_x+yk_y)}\\\\,dxdy. The slice is then s(k_x) :s(k_x)=F(k_x,0) =\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x,y)\\\\,e^{-2\\\\pi ixk_x}\\\\,dxdy :::=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left[\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\right]\\\\,e^{-2\\\\pi ixk_x} dx :::=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty p(x)\\\\,e^{-2\\\\pi ixk_x} dx which is just the Fourier transform of p(x). The proof for higher dimensions is easily generalized from the above example.  The FHA cycle  If the two-dimensional function f(r) is circularly symmetric, it may be represented as f(r), where r = r. In this case the projection onto any projection line will be the Abel transform of f(r). The two-dimensional Fourier transform of f(r) will be a circularly symmetric function given by the zeroth-order Hankel transform of f(r), which will therefore also represent any slice through the origin. The projection- slice theorem then states that the Fourier transform of the projection equals the slice or : F_1 A_1 = H, where A1 represents the Abel-transform operator, projecting a two-dimensional circularly symmetric function onto a one- dimensional line, F1 represents the 1-D Fourier-transform operator, and H represents the zeroth-order Hankel-transform operator.  Extension to fan beam or cone-beam CT  The projection-slice theorem is suitable for CT image reconstruction with parallel beam projections. It does not directly apply to fanbeam or conebeam CT. The theorem was extended to fan-beam and conebeam CT image reconstruction by Shuang-ren Zhao in 1995.

It is larger in surface area than Lake Tahoe, but it is much smaller in volume due to Tahoe's depth. Flathead Lake has a maximum depth of ,About Flathead Head, Flathead Lake Biological Station, The University of Montana and an average of . This makes Flathead Lake deeper than the average depths of the Yellow Sea or the Persian Gulf. Flathead Lake is in a scenic part of Montana, southwest of Glacier National Park and is flanked by two scenic highways, which wind along its curving shoreline. On the west side is U.S. Route 93, and on the east, is Route 35. alt= The lake is bordered on its eastern shore by the Mission Mountains and on the west by the Salish Mountains. The Flathead valley was formed by the glacial damming of the Flathead River and sustains a remarkably mild climate for a region located this far north and inland; the Pacific Ocean is almost to the west. The mild climate allows for cherry orchards on the east shore and vineyards for wine production on the west shore. There are also apple, pear and plum orchards around the lake as well as vegetables, hay, honey, nursery tree, Christmas tree, sod/turf, and wheat production bordering or near the lake. There are several islands in the lake. Wild Horse Island is the largest at . Melita Island is a island on Flathead Lake, located about one-half mile off the west lakeshore. At its highest point Melita is above water level.

The island is owned by the Boy Scouts of America, and is used as a summer camp and for other activities.[http://www.melitaisland.org/aboutmelita.htm About Melita Island. There a\\\\is also a bald eagle reaserve which is protected by the Native Americans. The island was bought for approximetaly 3 million dollars. Retrieved April 5, 2008. History Once known as \\"Salish Lake\\", this body of water was named for the Salish Indians. Early European Americans called them the Flathead Indians because of a misinterpretation of early Native American sign language. A common misconception is that the name is derived from a practice of head flattening more common among tribes such as the Chinook. There is no evidence to show that the Salish ever had this custom. Since the late 19th century, the Salish were mostly removed to the Flathead Indian Reservation, located at the southern end of the lake. Kerr Dam, built near Polson, regulates the lake's water level, generates hydroelectric power, and provides water for irrigation to support agriculture in the area. The lake has an irregularly shaped shoreline and a dozen small islands, the largest of which is a state park called Wild Horse Island. These islands cover . The Flathead River and the Swan River (known also as the Bigfork River where it enters the lake) are the lake's major tributaries. The lake is inhabited by the native bull trout and cutthroat trout, as well as the non-native lake trout, yellow perch, and lake whitefish. Local residents have reported sighting other aquatic fauna in the lake as well, such as sturgeon and the Flathead Lake Monster. The non-native opossum shrimp, (Mysis diluviana), were introduced by Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in the Flathead drainage basin to encourage production of larger kokanee salmon; they migrated into Flathead Lake and have altered the ecosystem. Fishermen had introduced lake trout 80 years prior but remained at low densities until the non-native Mysis became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids; this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery. The formerly abundant kokanee were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by Mysis has shifted zooplankton and phytoplankton community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant step increase of 55 mg C m‚àí2 d‚àí1 (i.e., 21% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading. Mysis facilitated predation by lake trout and indirectly caused the collapse of kokanee, redirecting energy flow through the ecosystem that would otherwise have been available to other top predators (bald eagles). Geology Flathead Lake lies at the southern end of a geological feature called the Rocky Mountain Trench. The trench, which formed with the Rocky Mountains, extends north into the southern Yukon as a straight, steep valley, which also holds the headwaters of the Columbia River. During the last ice age this trench was filled by an enormous glacier. As the glacier moved southward it carved out the trench. The Polson Moraine, near present-day Polson, Montana, marks the southernmost extent of the glacier during the last ice age and thus is the site of the glacier's terminal moraine. Some clouds over Flathead Lake in Polson, Montana, as the sun is setting The large size of the Polson Moraine indicates that the glacier stalled here for many years before retreating. As the climate warmed, a portion of the glacier in the Mission Valley receded more slowly than the main body, which kept the lake basin from being filled with sediment. Eventually this ice also melted, forming a lake behind the moraine. Once the water reached the top of this moraine dam, it began to cut a channel through it. Most moraine dammed lakes drain quickly because water cuts entirely through the moraine. However, Flathead Lake remains because a bedrock hill buried underneath the Polson Moraine prevented the moraine from being completely cut through so the meltwater never completely drained. At one time, probably when the valley was partially filled by a glacier, the level of Flathead Lake was about higher and drained through the valley west of Elmo, Montana, which is at the end of Big Arm Bay, bottom center in the aerial photo above. Water carved out a wide, flat-bottomed pass with a deeper, narrow channel at the south edge of the pass. The deeper channel and traces of the dry riverbed are still visible from Route 28. Fish of Flathead Lake Flathead Lake is home to a number of native and non-native fishes, and is managed cooperatively by both Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The lake is home to the semi-annual \\"Mack Days\\" Lake Trout fishing contest, which aims to reduce the non-native \\"Mackinaw trout\\" or lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations, as well as educate people about the Flathead Lake Fisheries Management Plan. Like the majority of other nonnative species, they became established in the lake from the late 1800s-early 1900s. The introduction of lake trout has placed increased pressure on the ecologically similar threatened native bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). Since the inception of this event in 2002, over 402,000 lake trout have been harvested. Another recent introduced non-native fish is the Dodd Fish, another name for yellow perch (Perca flavescens). *Native #Cutthroat Trout #Northern Pikeminnow #Bull Trout #Mountain Whitefish #Westslope Cutthroat Trout *Nonnative #Brown Trout #Lake Trout #Golden Trout #Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout #Brook Trout #Rainbow Trout #Kokanee Salmon #Northern Pike #Yellow Perch #Largemouth Bass #Smallmouth Bass #Sturgeon (sp) In addition to these commonly-pursued game fish, the lake is also home to other native species that currently are not actively managed by government fish and wildlife agencies, including the longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus).

H. Abel, Journal f√ºr die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 1, pp. 153‚Äì157 (1826). named for Niels Henrik Abel, is an integral transform often used in the analysis of spherically symmetric or axially symmetric functions. The Abel transform of a function f(r) is given by : F(y) = 2 \\\\int_y^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f(r)r}{\\\\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}} \\\\,dr. Assuming that f(r) drops to zero more quickly than 1/r, the inverse Abel transform is given by : f(r) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_r^\\\\infty \\\\frac{dF}{dy} \\\\,\\\\frac{dy}{\\\\sqrt{y^2 - r^2}}. In image analysis, the forward Abel transform is used to project an optically thin, axially symmetric emission function onto a plane, and the reverse Abel transform is used to calculate the emission function given a projection (i.e. a scan or a photograph) of that emission function. In absorption spectroscopy of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated absorbance along a ray with closest distance y from the center of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local absorption coefficient at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with axially symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM), filtered back-brojection (FBP) algorithms should be employed. In recent years, the inverse Abel transform (and its variants) has become the cornerstone of data analysis in photofragment-ion imaging and photoelectron imaging. Among recent most notable extensions of inverse Abel transform are the \\"onion peeling\\" and \\"basis set expansion\\" (BASEX) methods of photoelectron and photoion image analysis.  Geometrical interpretation  A geometrical interpretation of the Abel transform in two dimensions. An observer (I) looks along a line parallel to the x axis a distance y above the origin. What the observer sees is the projection (i.e. the integral) of the circularly symmetric function f(r) along the line of sight. The function f(r) is represented in gray in this figure. The observer is assumed to be located infinitely far from the origin so that the limits of integration are ¬±‚àû. In two dimensions, the Abel transform F(y) can be interpreted as the projection of a circularly symmetric function f(r) along a set of parallel lines of sight at a distance y from the origin. Referring to the figure on the right, the observer (I) will see : F(y) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\right) \\\\,dx, where f(r) is the circularly symmetric function represented by the gray color in the figure. It is assumed that the observer is actually at x = ‚àû, so that the limits of integration are ¬±‚àû, and all lines of sight are parallel to the x axis. Realizing that the radius r is related to x and y as r2 = x2 + y2, it follows that : dx = \\\\frac{r\\\\,dr}{\\\\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}} for x > 0. Since f(r) is an even function in x, we may write : F(y) = 2 \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\\\right) \\\\,dx = 2 \\\\int_{y}^\\\\infty f(r)\\\\,\\\\frac{r\\\\,dr}{\\\\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}}, which yields the Abel transform of f(r). The Abel transform may be extended to higher dimensions. Of particular interest is the extension to three dimensions. If we have an axially symmetric function f(œÅ, z), where œÅ2 = x2 + y2 is the cylindrical radius, then we may want to know the projection of that function onto a plane parallel to the z axis. Without loss of generality, we can take that plane to be the yz plane, so that : F(y, z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(\\\\rho, z) \\\\,dx = 2 \\\\int_y^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f(\\\\rho, z) \\\\rho \\\\,d\\\\rho}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho^2 - y^2}}, which is just the Abel transform of f(œÅ, z) in œÅ and y. A particular type of axial symmetry is spherical symmetry. In this case, we have a function f(r), where r2 = x2 + y2 + z2. The projection onto, say, the yz plane will then be circularly symmetric and expressible as F(s), where s2 = y2 + z2. Carrying out the integration, we have : F(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(r) \\\\,dx = 2 \\\\int_s^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f(r) r \\\\,dr}{\\\\sqrt{r^2 - s^2}}, which is again, the Abel transform of f(r) in r and s.  Verification of the inverse Abel transform  Assuming f is continuously differentiable and f, f' drop to zero faster than 1/r, we can set u=f(r) and v=\\\\sqrt{r^2-y^2} . Integration by parts then yields :F(y) = -2 \\\\int_y^\\\\infty f'(r) \\\\sqrt{r^2-y^2} \\\\, dr. Differentiating formally, :F'(y) = 2 y \\\\int_y^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f'(r)}{\\\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}} \\\\, dr. Now substitute this into the inverse Abel transform formula: :-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_r^\\\\infty \\\\frac{F'(y)}{\\\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}} \\\\, dy = \\\\int_r^\\\\infty \\\\int_y^\\\\infty \\\\frac{-2 y}{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{(y^2-r^2) (s^2-y^2)}} f'(s) \\\\, ds dy. By Fubini's theorem, the last integral equals :\\\\int_r^\\\\infty \\\\int_r^s \\\\frac{-2 y}{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{(y^2-r^2) (s^2-y^2)}} \\\\, dy f'(s) \\\\,ds = \\\\int_r^\\\\infty (-1) f'(s) \\\\, ds = f(r).  Generalization of the Abel transform to discontinuous F(y)  Consider the case where F(y) is discontinuous at y=y_\\\\Delta, where it abruptly changes its value by a finite amount \\\\Delta F. That is, y_\\\\Delta and \\\\Delta F are defined by \\\\Delta F \\\\equiv \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\rightarrow 0} [ F(y_\\\\Delta-\\\\epsilon) - F(y_\\\\Delta+\\\\epsilon) ]. Such a situation is encountered in tethered polymers (Polymer brush) exhibiting a vertical phase separation, where F(y) stands for the polymer density profile and f(r) is related to the spatial distribution of terminal, non-tethered monomers of the polymers. The Abel transform of a function f(r) is under these circumstances again given by: :F(y)=2\\\\int_y^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f(r)r\\\\,dr}{\\\\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}. Assuming f(r) drops to zero more quickly than 1/r, the inverse Abel transform is however given by : f(r)=\\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\delta(r-y_\\\\Delta)\\\\sqrt{1-(y_\\\\Delta/r)^2} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{H(y_\\\\Delta-r)}{\\\\sqrt{y_\\\\Delta^2-r^2}} \\\\right] \\\\Delta F-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_r^\\\\infty\\\\frac{d F}{dy}\\\\frac{dy}{\\\\sqrt{y^2-r^2}}. where \\\\delta is the Dirac delta function and H(x) the Heaviside step function. The extended version of the Abel transform for discontinuous F is proven upon applying the Abel transform to shifted, continuous F(y), and it reduces to the classical Abel transform when \\\\Delta F=0. If F(y) has more than a single discontinuity, one has to introduce shifts for any of them to come up with a generalized version of the inverse Abel transform which contains n additional terms, each of them corresponding to one of the n discontinuities.  Relationship to other integral transforms = Relationship to the Fourier and Hankel transforms  The Abel transform is one member of the FHA cycle of integral operators. For example, in two dimensions, if we define A as the Abel transform operator, F as the Fourier transform operator and H as the zeroth- order Hankel transform operator, then the special case of the projection-slice theorem for circularly symmetric functions states that : FA = H. In other words, applying the Abel transform to a 1-dimensional function and then applying the Fourier transform to that result is the same as applying the Hankel transform to that function. This concept can be extended to higher dimensions.  Relationship to the Radon transform  Abel transform can be viewed as the Radon transform of an isotropic 2D function f(r). As f(r) is isotropic, its Radon transform is the same at different angles of the viewing axis. Thus, the Abel transform is a function of the distance along the viewing axis only.

Each hyperbola is defined by x=\\\\pm c^2/\\\\alpha and \\\\eta=\\\\alpha\\\\tau/c (with c=1, \\\\alpha=1) in equation (). Hyperbolic motion is the motion of an object with constant proper acceleration in special relativity. It is called hyperbolic motion because the equation describing the path of the object through spacetime is a hyperbola, as can be seen when graphed on a Minkowski diagram whose coordinates represent a suitable inertial (non-accelerated) frame. This motion has several interesting features, among them that it is possible to outrun a photon if given a sufficient head start, as may be concluded from the diagram. History Hermann Minkowski (1908) showed the relation between a point on a worldline and the magnitude of four-acceleration and a \\"curvature hyperbola\\" (). In the context of Born rigidity, Max Born (1909) subsequently coined the term \\"hyperbolic motion\\" () for the case of constant magnitude of four- acceleration, then provided a detailed description for charged particles in hyperbolic motion, and introduced the corresponding \\"hyperbolically accelerated reference system\\" (). Born's formulas were simplified and extended by Arnold Sommerfeld (1910). For early reviews see the textbooks by Max von Laue (1911, 1921) or Wolfgang Pauli (1921). See also Galeriu (2015) or Gourgoulhon (2013), and Acceleration (special relativity)#History. Worldline The proper acceleration \\\\alpha of a particle is defined as the acceleration that a particle \\"feels\\" as it accelerates from one inertial reference frame to another. If the proper acceleration is directed parallel to the line of motion, it is related to the ordinary three-acceleration in special relativity a=du/dT by :\\\\alpha=\\\\gamma^3 a=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(1-u^2/c^2\\\\right)^{3/2}}\\\\frac{du}{dT}, where u is the instantaneous speed of the particle, \\\\gamma the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and T is the coordinate time. Solving for the equation of motion gives the desired formulas, which can be expressed in terms of coordinate time T as well as proper time \\\\tau. For simplification, all initial values for time, location, and velocity can be set to 0, thus:; First edition 1911, second expanded edition 1913, third expanded edition 1919.

For instance, the expression :X=\\\\frac{c^{2}}{\\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\tau}{c}-1\\\\right) can be subjected to a spatial shift of amount c^2/\\\\alpha, thus :X=\\\\frac{c^{2}}{\\\\alpha}\\\\cosh\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\tau}{c},Pauli (1921), p. 628, used the notation x^{4}=a\\\\operatorname{ch}\\\\frac{ct}{a} where a=\\\\frac{c^{2}}{b} by which the observer is at position X=c^2/\\\\alpha at time T=0. Furthermore, by setting x=c^2/\\\\alpha and introducing the rapidity \\\\eta=\\\\operatorname{artanh}\\\\frac{u}{c}=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\tau}{c}, the equations for hyperbolic motion reduce toSommerfeld (1910), pp. 670-671 used the form x=r\\\\cos(\\\\varphi) and l=r\\\\sin(\\\\varphi) with the imaginary angle i\\\\psi and imaginary time l=ict. with the hyperbola X^{2}-c^{2}T^{2}=x^{2}. Charged particles in hyperbolic motion Born (1909), Sommerfeld (1910), von Laue (1911), Pauli (1921) also formulated the equations for the electromagnetic field of charged particles in hyperbolic motion. This was extended by Hermann Bondi & Thomas Gold (1955) and Fulton & Rohrlich (1960) :\\\\begin{align}E_{\\\\rho'}'= & \\\\frac{\\\\left(8e/\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)\\\\rho'z'}{\\\\xi^{\\\\prime3}}\\\\ E_{z'}'= & \\\\frac{-\\\\left(4e/\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)1/\\\\alpha^{2}+t^{\\\\prime2}+\\\\rho^{\\\\prime2}-z^{\\\\prime2}}{\\\\xi^{\\\\prime3}}\\\\ E_{\\\\varphi'}'= & H_{\\\\varphi'}'=H_{z'}'=0\\\\ H_{\\\\varphi'}'= & \\\\frac{\\\\left(8e/\\\\alpha^{2}\\\\right)\\\\rho't'}{\\\\xi^{\\\\prime3}}\\\\ \\\\xi'= & \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(1/\\\\alpha^{2}+t^{\\\\prime2}-\\\\rho^{\\\\prime2}-z^{\\\\prime2}\\\\right)^{2}+\\\\left(2\\\\rho'/\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{2}} \\\\end{align} This is related to the controversially discussed question, whether charges in perpetual hyperbolic motion do radiate or not, and whether this is consistent with the equivalence principle ‚Äì even though it's about an ideal situation, because perpetual hyperbolic motion is not possible. While early authors such as Born (1909) or Pauli (1921) argued that no radiation arises, later authors such as Bondi & Gold and Fulton & Rohrlich showed that radiation does indeed arise. Proper reference frame The light path through E marks the apparent event horizon of an observer P in hyperbolic motion. In equation () for hyperbolic motion, the expression x was constant, whereas the rapidity \\\\eta was variable. However, as pointed out by Sommerfeld, one can define x as a variable, while making \\\\eta constant. This means, that the equations become transformations indicating the simultaneous rest shape of an accelerated body with hyperbolic coordinates (x,y,z,\\\\eta) as seen by a comoving observer :cT=x\\\\sinh\\\\eta,\\\\quad X=x\\\\cosh\\\\eta,\\\\quad Y=y,\\\\quad Z=z By means of this transformation, the proper time becomes the time of the hyperbolically accelerated frame. These coordinates, which are commonly called Rindler coordinates (similar variants are called Kottler-M√∏ller coordinates or Lass coordinates), can be seen as a special case of Fermi coordinates or Proper coordinates, and are often used in connection with the Unruh effect. Using these coordinates, it turns out that observers in hyperbolic motion possesses an apparent event horizon, beyond which no signal can reach them. Special conformal transformation A lesser known method for defining a reference frame in hyperbolic motion is the employment of the special conformal transformation, consisting of an inversion, a translation, and another inversion. It is commonly interpreted as a gauge transformation in Minkowski space, though some authors alternatively use it as an acceleration transformation (see Kastrup for a critical historical survey). It has the form :X^{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{x^{\\\\mu}-a^{\\\\mu}x^{2}}{1-2ax+a^{2}x^{2}} Using only one spatial dimension by x^{\\\\mu}=(t,x), and further simplifying by setting x=0, and using the acceleration a^{\\\\mu}=(0,-\\\\alpha/2), it follows :T=\\\\frac{t}{1-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\alpha{}^{2}t^{2}},\\\\quad X=\\\\frac{-\\\\alpha t^{2}}{2\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\alpha{}^{2}t^{2}\\\\right)} with the hyperbola \\\\left(X-1/\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{2}-T^{2}=1/\\\\alpha^{2}. It turns out that at t=\\\\pm(x+2/\\\\alpha) the time becomes singular, to which Fulton & Rohrlich & Witten remark that one has to stay away from this limit, while Kastrup (who is very critical of the acceleration interpretation) remarks that this is one of the strange results of this interpretation.

It belongs to the Church of Ireland and was completed in 1879. The cathedral is located on the south side of the River Lee, on ground that has been a place of worship since the 7th century, and is dedicated to Finbarr of Cork, patron saint of the city. It was once in the Diocese of Cork; it is now one of the three cathedrals in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin. Christian use of the site dates back to a 7th-century AD monastery, which according to legend was founded by Finbarr of Cork. The original building survived until the 12th century, by when it had either fallen into disuse or been destroyed by the Normans. Around 1536, during the Protestant Reformation, the cathedral became part of the established church, later known as the Church of Ireland. The previous building was constructed in the 1730s, but was widely regarded as plain and featureless. The cathedral's demolition and rebuild was commissioned in the mid-19th century by an Anglican church intent on strengthening its hand after the reforms of penal law. Work began in 1863, and resulted in the first major commissioned project for the Victorian architect William Burges, who designed most of the cathedral's architecture, sculpture, stained glass, mosaics and interior furniture. Saint Fin Barre's foundation stone was laid in 1865. The cathedral was consecrated in 1870 and the limestone spires completed by October 1879. The cathedral is mostly built from local stone sourced from Little Island and Fermoy. The exterior is capped by three spires: two on the west front and above where the transept crosses the nave. Many of the external sculptures, including the gargoyles, were modelled by Thomas Nicholls. The entrances contain the figures of over a dozen biblical figures, capped by a tympanum showing a Resurrection scene. History=Finbarr of Cork Modern church at Gougane Barra The church grounds are located south of the River Lee on Holy Island, on one of the many inlets forming the Great Marsh of Munster (Corcach Mor na Mumhan). Saint Fin Barre's is on the site of at least two previous church buildings, each dedicated to Fin Barre of Cork, patron saint of Cork city, and the founder of the monastic hermitage at Gougane Barra. Finbarr was born in about 550. He was, by legend, given Gougane Barra as a place of contemplation, and visited Cork city to lay the foundation stones for the \\"one true Christian faith\\". By legend, after Finbarr died his remains were brought to Cork to be enclosed in a shrine located on the site of today's cathedral. Archaeological evidence suggests the first site at Fin Barre's probably dates from the 7th century, and consisted of a church and round tower which survived until the 12th century, after which it fell into neglect, or was destroyed during the Norman invasions. Medieval and 18th-century churches Photograph of the early stage of the construction, A 1644 reference to the site notes that \\"in one of the suburbs of Korq [Cork] there is an old tower ten or twelve feet [3.3 m] in circumference, and more than one hundred feet [30 m] high ... believ[ed] to have been built by St. Baril [Finbarr]\\". The building was badly damaged in 1690 during the Siege of Cork, after which only the steeple remained intact, due to an outbreak of fire and the impact of a 24-pound (11 kg) shot from Elizabeth Fort in nearby Barrack Street. The cannonball was rediscovered during the 1865 demolition and is now on display in the cathedral. The church was demolished in 1735 and replaced the same year by a smaller building, as part of a wider phase of citywide construction and renovation. Only the earlier spire was retained for the new building. The older part of this church was described in 1862 as Doric in style, attached to a featureless modern tower with an \\"ill-formed\\" spire. The building was widely considered to be poorly designed. The Dublin Builder described it as \\"a shabby apology for a cathedral which has long disgraced Cork\\", while The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland judged it \\"a plain, massive, dull, tasteless, oblong pile, totally destitute of what is usually regarded as cathedral character, and possessing hardly a claim to any sort of architectural consideration\\". It was demolished in 1865. 19th-century building In April 1862, the Church of Ireland, in pursuit of a larger, more attractive cathedral, and determined to reassert its authority in response to a resurgent Catholicism, initiated a competition for a replacement building, which became the commission for the first cathedral to be built in the British Isles since London's St Paul's. The following February, the designs of the architect William Burges, then 35, were declared the winner of the competition to build the new cathedral. Burges disregarded the ¬£15,000 budget, and produced a design that he estimated would cost twice as much. Despite the protestations of fellow competitors, it won. His diary records his reaction ‚Äì \\"Got Cork!\\" ‚Äì while cathedral accounts mention a payment of ¬£100 as prize money. The foundation stone was laid on 12 January 1865, the unfinished cathedral was consecrated in 1870, and the spires topped out in 1879. Gargoyle Gargoyle Gargoyle Burges used a number of his earlier unrealised designs for the exterior, including those intended for the Crimea Memorial Church, Istanbul, St John's Cathedral, Brisbane and elevations for Lille Cathedral. The main obstacle was economics. Despite the efforts of fundraisers, Cork was unable to afford a large cathedral. Burges partially alleviated this by designing a three-spired exterior which enhanced the size of the building to viewers. He realised early on the build would vastly exceed the money the city had raised. The superiority of his design was recognised by the Bishop of Cork, John Gregg, who supported Burges and lobbied for additional funding. Gregg was instrumental in sourcing additional money, including local merchants such as William Crawford of the Crawford brewing family and Francis Wise, a local distiller. The final total was significantly over ¬£100,000. Burges, assured by the efforts of Gregg, was unconcerned. Gregg died before the completion of the project. In his place, his son Robert continued his father's support, and in 1879 ceremoniously placed the final stone on the eastern spire. By then the contractors estimated that the build was nearing its completion, with only a number of pre-designed stained glass fittings left to be installed. The cathedral holds the book of estimates prepared for the decoration of the west front. Nicholls was paid ¬£1,769 for the modelling, and Robert McLeod ¬£5,153 for the carving. Burges took 10 per cent for the design, more than his usual 5 per cent, apparently due to his high level of personal involvement. Its construction took seven years before the first service was held in 1870. During the first building phase, three firms of contractors were employed, owned by, chronologically, Robert Walker, Gilbert Cockburn and John Delany who eventually completed the construction of the spires in 1879. Building, carving and decoration continued into the 20th century, long after Burges' death in 1881, including the marble panelling of the aisles, the installation of the reredos and side choir walls, and the 1915 construction of the chapter house. Saint Fin Barre's is described by the architectural historians David Lawrence and Ann Wilson as \\"undoubtedly [Burges'] greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture\\", with an interior that is \\"overwhelming and intoxicating\\". Through his ability, careful leadership of his team, artistic control, and by vastly exceeding the intended budget, Burges produced a building which ‚Äì though not much larger than a parish church ‚Äì has been described as \\"a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to the Almighty's praise\\". 20th and 21st centuries Southern side Mindful that the cathedral was unlikely to be finished in his lifetime, Burges produced comprehensive plans for its decoration and furnishing; recorded in his Book of Furniture and Book of Designs. At the end of the 20th century, a major restoration of the cathedral, costing ¬£5 million, was undertaken. This included the reinstatement and restoration of the twin trumpets held by the resurrection angel which had been vandalised in 1999. The restoration programme also saw the cleaning, repointing and repair of the exterior of the building, including the re- carving of some of Burges' gargoyles, where repair proved impracticable. The cathedral's heating system was also replaced, when it was found to be damaging the intricate mosaic floor. In 2006, Lawrence and Wilson published the first detailed study of the cathedral's history and architecture, The Cathedral of Saint Fin Barre at Cork: William Burges in Ireland. The building is also covered in Frank Keohane's volume, Cork: City and County, in the Buildings of Ireland series, published in 2020. The cathedral is one of the three cathedrals of the Anglican Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. Notable interments in the graveyard include those of archbishop William Lyon (died 1617), Richard Boyle (died 1644),Ware, James. \\"The Antiquities and History of Ireland\\". Dublin: A. Crook, 1705. p. 36 and in a family vault, the first \\"Lady Freemason\\", Elizabeth Aldworth (died ). Exterior=Architecture The cathedral's style is Gothic Revival, Burges' preferred period which he used for his own home, The Tower House, in London. He reused elements of the unsuccessful designs he had earlier produced for competitions for cathedrals at Lille and Brisbane. The shell of the building is mostly limestone, sourced from near Cork, with the interior walls formed from stone brought from Bath. The red marble came from Little Island, the purple-brown stone from Fermoy. Each of the three spires supports a Celtic cross, a reference to Saint Patrick, seen as a foundational ancestor by both Irish Catholics and Protestants. This inclusion was an implicit statement of national identity, but was against Burges' wishes. His initial design included weather vanes, a choice rejected by the building committee, who, according to the historian Ant√≥in O'Callaghan, wanted the church to \\"retain the continuity with the one true faith of the ancient past\\". The spires had a troubled construction: it was a difficult build from a technical point of view and thus expensive to fund. The cost reached ¬£40,000 early in the build, with a further ¬£60,000 spent by the time the spires were in place. Along the way, a number of sub- contractors were hired and dismissed; the contract was eventually completed by the Cork builder John Delaney, hired in May 1876. By the end of the following year the main and two ancillary spires were complete. Sculpture copper- gilt \\"Resurrection Angel\\", placed over the sanctuary roofalt=Robed figure of a standing winged angel with two straight trumpets, gazing down An 1881 estimate by the local stonemason McLeod suggests that Burges provided around 844 sculptures, of which around 412 were for the interior. The total of some 1,260 sculptures include 32 gargoyles, each with different animal heads. Burges oversaw nearly all aspects of the design, headquartered in his office in Buckingham Street and on numerous site visits. Most modern scholars agree that his overarching control over the design of the architecture, statuary, stained glass and internal decorations, led to the cathedral's unity of style. He considered sculpture as an \\"indispensable attribute of architectural effect\\" and, at Saint Fin Barre's, believed he was engaged upon \\"a work which has not been attempted since the West front of Wells Cathedral\\". In the designs for the pieces decorating the cathedral, Burges worked closely with Thomas Nicholls, who constructed each figure in plaster, and with McLeod and local stonemasons, who carved almost all of the sculptures in situ. Burges' designs for the western fa√ßade were based on medieval French iconography. He considered this front to be the most important exterior feature as it would be lit by the setting sun and thus the most dramatic. The theme is The Last Judgement, with representations of the twelve Apostles bearing instruments of their martyrdom, the Wise and the Foolish Virgins, the Resurrection of the Dead and the Beasts of The Evangelists. The gilded copper \\"resurrection angel\\" facing eastwards on the main spire is locally the cathedral's most iconic feature, and colloquially known as the \\"goldie angel\\". It was designed by Burges and erected in 1870 free of charge as his gift to the city, in recognition of Cork's willingness to fund his original design, and positioned in place of an intended wrought-iron cross. Tympanum: The Last Judgement The imagery of the tympanum is taken from the Book of Revelation, with the divine on the upper register, and mortals below. It shows an angel, accompanied by John the Evangelist, measuring the temple in Jerusalem, while beneath them the dead rise from their graves. Of these sculptures, the Victorian critic Charles Eastlake, writing in A History of the Gothic Revival, considered that \\"no finer examples of decorative sculpture have been produced during the Revival\\". Burges found it difficult to realise some of his original images for the sculptures and stained glass panels; a number of them contained frontal nudes, including the designs for the creation of the planets, the figures of Adam and Eve, Christ in Glory, Our Lord as King Crucified, the dead rising from their graves, and the welcoming angels. In August 1868, some Protestant committee members, led by the chancellor, George Webster, rejected the use of images of the naked human body in ecclesiastical iconography, especially in images of Christ, and forced Burges to provide clothed designs, modesty-providing loin cloths, or strategically placed foliage or books. In frustration Burges wrote, \\"I am sorry to see Puritanism so rampant in Cork ... I wish we could transplant the building to England\\". His revised designs were reviewed in April and May 1869, but were again rejected. Both Gregg and the dean, Arthur Edwards supported Burges, and moved the decision from the general committee to a select vestry sub-committee. Although Webster continued to object, the modified designs were finally approved. Interior=Plan and elevation Apse and sanctuary ceiling The cathedral's plan is conventional; the west front is opened by three entrance doors leading to the nave, with internal vaulting, arcade, triforium and clerestory, rising to a timber roof. Beyond the nave, the pulpit, choir, bishop's throne and altar end in an ambulatory. The small floor-plan drew criticism both at the time and in later years. The building is relatively short at 180 feet length, but contains all of the traditional elements of a cathedral of much greater size. A contemporary critic, Robert Rolt Brash, wrote; \\"the effect of this is to make the building look exceedingly short, and disproportionately high\\". Although modest in size, the compact design makes the most of the small footprint. The three spires allow the illusion of greater interior space. Main features Burges designed the majority of the interior, including the mosaic pavement, the altar, the pulpit and bishop's throne. The narrow and unusually high marble nave, from red and puce stone, is supported by large columns supporting the central tower and spire. The exterior gives the impression of a large structure, which is at odds with the reduced size of the interior, where the choir, sanctuary and ambulatory take up almost half of the floor-space. The interior is filled with colour, most especially from the stained glass windows. This aspect of the interior is in marked contrast to the uniform and austere grey of the exterior. View from the gallery The cylindrical pulpit is located near the entrance and was completed in 1874, but not painted until 1935. Like the baptismal font, it is placed on four sculpted legs. It contains five stone relief figures, assumed to be the four evangelists, and Paul the Apostle sitting on an upturned \\"pagan\\" altar, and a winged dragon below the reading stand. The baptismal font is located near the entrance. Its ledge is decorated with a carving of the head of John the Baptist. The font's bowl is of Cork red marble, and supported by a stem, also red marble, a marble shaft of sculpted capitals, and an octagonal base. Brass lettering reads \\"We are buried with Him by baptism into death\\". The lectern (reading desk) is made of solid brass, from a design Burges had originally intended for Lille Cathedral. It is decorated with the heads of Moses and King David. There is a \\"Heroes Column\\" (War Memorial) by the Choir, at the Dean's chapel. It contains the names of 400 men from the dioceses killed in battle during the First World War. A processional cross, completed in 1974 by Patrick Pye, is located in front of the Dean's chapel. The 46-foot 'Great Oak Throne' of the Cork Dioceses Bishop was installed in 1878, alongside a statue of Fin Barre of Cork and a kneeling angel. Stained glass West front rose window, also known as the Creation Window Left: Cain and Abel sacrificing, Right: Cain kills Abel Burges conceived the iconographical scheme for the stained glass windows, designed the individual panels for the each of the 74 windows, and oversaw every stage of their production. According to Maurice Carey, \\"in consequence, the windows have a consistent cohesive style and follow a logical sequence in subject matter\\". The panels were cartooned by H. W. Lonsdale and manufactured in London between 1868 and 1869 by William Gualbert Saunders, who worked in Burges' office before forming his own firm of stained glass makers. Doctrinal objections to some of the figures, particularly of Christ, lead to a delay of four years, with their eventual installation between 1873 and 1881. Four windows remain incomplete. Lonsdale's cartoons are kept at the cathedral. Many of the figures relate to Christian iconography, and echo those in the tympanum, including, in the ambulatory a window showing God as the King of Heaven overlooking the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In the panel, Matthew takes human form, Mark is depicted as a lion, Luke as an ox, while John takes the form of an eagle. As elsewhere in the cathedral, the illustrations can be divided between the divine, wise and foolish. The scheme begins and ends with two rose windows, at the west front and south transept respectively. The west rose window shows God as the creator resting on a rainbow and in the act of blessing. He is surrounded by eight compartments, each inspired by the scenes from Book of Genesis, beginning with the creation of light, and ending with the birth of Eve, and Adam naming the animals. The south transept rose window, known as the \\"Heavenly Hierarchies\\", places Christ the King in the centre, with the compartments containing a series of angels, archangels and cherubim. Separate glass sheets containing building tools are placed between each angelic compartment. The nave windows contain signs of the Zodiac. Each lancet by the arcade contains a grisaille panel. These scenes are mostly from the Old Testament, while those from the transepts onward are of prophets who foretold Christ's coming, or from the New Testament. The clerestory panels above the high altar depict Christ reigning from his cross alongside His Mother, John, the Three Marys and various disciples. The windows around the ambulatory include scenes from the Life of Christ, culminating in a representation of heaven at worship from the Book of Revelation. Pipe organ Saint Fin Barre's organ pipes The organ was built in 1870 by William Hill & Sons. It consisted of three manuals, over 4,500 pipes and 40 stops. The main organ utilised a tubular-pneumatic action, with tracker action for the other two manuals. It was in place for the cathedral's grand opening on Saint Andrew's Day, 1870, and positioned in the west gallery, but moved to the north transept in 1889, to improve acoustics, maximise space, and avoid its interference with the view of the windows. That year, a 14-foot pit was dug in the floor beside the nave, as the new location for the organ. Its maintenance has been one of the most expensive part of the cathedral's upkeep. It was overhauled in 1889 by the Cork firm, T.W. Magahy, who added three new stops. The organ was moved from the west gallery (balcony) down to a pit in the north transept, where it sits today. Most of the choir organ is housed in an enclosure attached to the console, the lid of which can be raised or lowered electrically by the organist. The next major overhaul was in 1906 by Hele & Company of Plymouth, who added a fourth manual (the Solo). By this stage, the action of the organ was entirely pneumatic. In 1965‚Äì1966 J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London overhauled the soundboards, installed a new console with electropneumatic action, and lowered the pitch. By 2010 the organ's electrics were unreliable. Trevor Crowe was employed to reconstruct and increase the number of pipes, and make tonal enhancements, including a 32‚Ä≤ extension to the pedal trombone. The project cost ‚Ç¨1.2m and took three years to complete.

It is surrounded by smaller islands: Taravai in the southwest, Aukena and Akamaru in the southeast, and islands in the north. Mangareva has a permanent population of 1,239 (2012) and the largest village on the island, Rikitea, is the chief town of the Gambier Islands. The island is approximately long and, at , it comprises about 56% of the land area of the whole Gambier group. Mangareva has a high central ridge which runs the length of the island. The highest point in the Gambiers is Mt. Duff, on Mangareva, rising to along the island's south coast. The island has a large lagoon in diameter containing reefs whose fish and shellfish helped ancient islanders survive much more successfully than on nearby islands with no reefs. History Mangareva was once heavily forested and supported a large population that traded with other islands via canoes. However, excessive logging by the islanders during the 10th to the 15th centuries resulted in deforestation of the island, with disastrous results for its environment and economy (see Gambier Islands for more details). The first European to arrive at Mangareva was British Captain James Wilson in 1797 on the ship Duff. Wilson named the island group in honour of Admiral James Gambier, who had helped him to equip his vessel. Mangareva along with its dependencies in the Gambier Islands were ruled by a line of kings and later regents until the French formally annexed the islands. A French protectorate was requested on 16 February 1844 by King Maputeoa but was never ratified by the French government. On 4 February 1870, Prince Regent Arone Teikatoara and the Mangarevan government formally withdrew the protectorate request and asked the French not to intervene in the kingdom's affairs. After Father Honor√© Laval was removed to Tahiti, the native government changed its stance and an agreement between Prince Regent Arone and the French colonial authority in Tahiti was signed reaffirming the protectorate status on 30 November 1871. The Gambier Islands were finally annexed on 21 February 1881 under Prince Regent Bernardo Putairi and approved by the President of France on 30 January 1882. Transportation Mangareva is reached by boat from the nearby airport across the lagoon. Mangareva is an important travel link to Pitcairn Island. Practically the only way a traveler can reach Pitcairn Island is to fly to Tahiti, then to Mangareva. From there, a 32-hour boat ride will take the traveler to the island. Some reach Pitcairn by commercial shipping traffic, but that is less and less common as shipping lanes do not typically pass close to Pitcairn. Culture and fiction Painter and author Robert Lee Eskridge's book Manga Reva: The Forgotten Islands (Bobbs Merrill; 1931) offers first-hand observations of the environment, peoples, and traditions of Mangareva. It includes original illustrations and photographs by the author. In 1962, adventure-fiction writer Garland Roark acknowledged Eskridge's work in a foreword to his novel The Witch of Manga Reva. Eskridge also wrote and illustrated a children's book about his visit to Mangareva: South Sea Playmates (Bobbs Merrill; 1933). Binary system The Mangarevan people developed a binary number system centuries ahead of Europeans. In 2013, the islanders were discovered to have developed a novel binary system that allowed them to reduce the number of digits involved in binary counting: for example, representing 150 requires eight digits in binary (10010111) but only four in the Mangarevan system (VTPK, where V (varu) means 80, T (tataua) is 40, P (paua) is 20, and K (takau) is 10). As binary counting is unknown in other Polynesian societies, it most likely formed after Mangareva was settled between 1060 and 1360 AD. Since Gottfried Leibniz would not invent the modern binary number system until 1689, the Mangarevan binary steps prefigured the European invention of binary by as many as 300 to 600 years. In 2020, Mangarevan binary counting was shown to be an extension of a traditional Polynesian method of counting. Polynesian societies are known to count specific types of objects differently, and they count objects both singly (one by one) and collectively (by twos, fours, or eights). In each case, counting remains decimal (one, two, three‚Ä¶), though the unit counted varies (one, two, four, or eight). In Mangareva, counting collective items decimally produced productive terms for ten (takau or ten singles), twenty (paua or ten pairs), forty (tataua or ten groups of four), and eighty (varu or ten groups of eight). Given the availability of these terms and their associated numerical values, binary counting was then a simple adaptation of traditional Polynesian counting, which set aside every tenth item to mark ten of the items being counted (in New Zealand, this method was misunderstood by Europeans as undecimal or base-11 counting). In the traditional method, the pile of set- asides would then be counted the same way, with every tenth item marking a hundred (second round), thousand (third round), ten thousand items (fourth round), and so on. In Mangarevan binary, in the first round items were counted as before, but in the second round and thereafter they were grouped into eights (varu) and then fours (tataua), twos (paua), and singles (takau). Once counting had shifted to binary units in the second and subsequent rounds, the method was no longer decimal, suggesting an explanation for the upper limit of 800 (for items counted singly) observed for the counting system.

They cover an area of , and are the remnants of a caldera along with islets on the surrounding fringing reef. They are generally considered a separate island group from Tuamotu both because their culture and language (Mangarevan) are much more closely related to those of the Marquesas Islands, and because, while the Tuamotus comprise several chains of coral atolls, the Gambiers are of volcanic origin with central high islands. The population of the archipelago is 1319 people. Geography Gambier Islands (Mangareva) The Gambier Islands include the Mangareva Islands (the Gambier Islands proper), which have an enclosing coral reef which is broken by only three passages to the open sea. Besides Mangareva, the other notable high islands of the group are Akamaru, Angakauitai, Aukena, Kamaka, Kouaku, Makapu, Makaroa, Manui, Mekiro and Taravai. These are primarily of volcanic origin. A number of others are actually coral islands, hence of secondary volcanic origin, including Papuri, Puaumu, Totengengie and the Tokorua group. The Mangareva Islands are approximately 26.6 km2 in area, with a population in 2016 of 1319. The primary town is Rikitea, located on Mangareva, as is the highest point in the Gambiers, Mt. Duff, rising to along that island's south coast.

History From the 10th to the 15th centuries, the Gambiers hosted a population of several thousand people and traded with other island groups including the Marquesas, the Society Islands and Pitcairn Islands. However, excessive logging by the islanders resulted in almost complete deforestation on Mangareva, with disastrous results for the islands' environment and economy. The folklore of the islands records a slide into civil war and even cannibalism as trade links with the outside world broke down, and archaeological studies have confirmed this. Today, the islands can support a population of only a few hundred. In 1834, the French Picpus priests Honor√© Laval and Fran√ßois Caret with their assistant Columba Murphy founded a Roman Catholic mission in the Gambiers. After their success here, they moved to Tahiti in 1836. Mangareva along with its dependencies in the Gambier Islands were ruled by a line of kings and later regents that ruled until the French formally annexed the islands in 1881. A French protectorate was requested on 16 February 1844 by King Maputeoa but was never ratified by the French government. On 4 February 1870, Prince Regent Arone Teikatoara and the Mangarevan government formally withdrew the protectorate request and asked the French to not intervene in the kingdom's affairs.

The Gambier Islands were finally annexed on 21 February 1881 under Prince Regent Bernardo Putairi and approved by the President of France on 30 January 1882. Effects of French nuclear testing The Gambiers served as a logistical staging base for French nuclear testing activity in Mururoa, approximately 400 kilometers away. During this time, the French military dragged a chain through some of the coral reef beds to cut a wider and deeper channel for deep draft vessels. Higher rate of infections by ciguatera were subsequently recorded.

More ambiguous terms for a privately held company are closely held corporation, unquoted company, and unlisted company. Though less visible than their publicly traded counterparts, private companies have major importance in the world's economy. In 2008, the 441 largest private companies in the United States accounted for ($1.8 trillion) in revenues and employed 6.2 million people, according to Forbes. In 2005, using a substantially smaller pool size (22.7%) for comparison, the 339 companies on Forbes survey of closely held U.S. businesses sold a trillion dollars' worth of goods and services (44%) and employed four million people. In 2004, the Forbes count of privately held U.S. businesses with at least $1 billion in revenue was 305. State ownership vs. private ownership vs. cooperative ownership Private ownership of productive assets differs from state ownership or collective ownership (as in worker- owned companies). This usage is often found in former communist countries to differentiate from former state-owned enterprises, but it may be used anywhere when contrasting to a state-owned or a collectively owned company. In the United States, the term privately held company is more often used to describe for-profit enterprises whose shares are not traded on the stock market.  Ownership of stock  In countries with public trading markets, a privately held business is generally taken to mean one whose ownership shares or interests are not publicly traded. Often, privately held companies are owned by the company founders or their families and heirs or by a small group of investors. Sometimes employees also hold shares of private companies. Most small businesses are privately held. Subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies (for example, General Motors' Saturn Corporation), unless shares in the subsidiary itself are traded directly, have characteristics of both privately held companies and publicly traded companies. Such companies are usually subject to the same reporting requirements as privately held companies, but their assets, liabilities, and activities are also included in the reports of their parent companies, as required by the accountancy and securities industry rules relating to groups of companies.  Form of organization  Private companies may be called corporations, limited companies, limited liability companies, unlimited companies, or other names, depending on where and how they are organized and structured. In the United States, but not generally in the United Kingdom, the term is also extended to partnerships, sole proprietorships or business trusts. Each of these categories may have additional requirements and restrictions that may impact reporting requirements, income tax liabilities, governmental obligations, employee relations, marketing opportunities, and other business obligations and decisions. In many countries, there are forms of organization which are restricted to and are commonly used by private companies, for example, the private company limited by shares in the United Kingdom (abbreviated Ltd) or unlimited company and the proprietary limited company (abbreviated Pty Ltd) or unlimited proprietary company (abbreviated Pty) in South Africa and Australia.  Reporting obligations and restrictions  Privately held companies generally have fewer or less comprehensive reporting requirements and obligations for transparency, via annual reports, etc. than publicly traded companies do. For example, in the United States, unlike in Europe, privately held companies are not generally required to publish their financial statements. By not being required to disclose details about their operations and financial outlook, private companies are not forced to disclose information that may potentially be valuable to competitors and can avoid the immediate erosion of customer and stakeholder confidence in the event of financial duress. Further, with limited reporting requirements and shareholder expectations, private firms are afforded a greater operational flexibility by being able to focus on long-term growth rather than quarterly earnings. In addition, private company executives may steer their ships without shareholder approval, allowing them to take significant action without delays. In Australia, Part 2E of the Corporations Act 2001 requires that publicly traded companies file certain documents relating to their annual general meeting with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. There is a similar requirement for large proprietary companies, which are required to lodge Form 388H to the ASIC containing their financial report. In the United States, private companies are held to different accounting auditing standards than are public companies, overseen by the Private Company Counsel division of FASB.(see external links) Researching private companies and private companies' financials in the United States can involve contacting the Secretary of State for the state of incorporation (or for LLC or partnership, state of formation), or using specialized private company databases such as Dun & Bradstreet. Other companies, like Sageworks, provide aggregated data on privately held companies, segmented by industry code. Privately held companies also sometimes have restrictions on how many shareholders they may have. For example, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, section 12(g), limits a privately held company, generally, to fewer than 2000 shareholders, and the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, requires registration of investment companies that have more than 100 holders. In Australia, section 113 of the Corporations Act 2001 limits a privately held company to fifty non-employee shareholders.  Privately owned enterprise  A privately owned enterprise is a commercial enterprise that is owned by private investors, shareholders or owners (usually collectively, but they can be owned by a single individual), and is in contrast to state institutions, such as publicly owned enterprises and government agencies. Private enterprises comprise the private sector of an economy. An economic system that 1) contains a large private sector where privately run businesses are the backbone of the economy, and 2) business surplus is controlled by the owners, is referred to as capitalism. This contrasts with socialism, where industry is owned by the state or by all of the community in common. The act of taking assets into the private sector is referred to as privatization. A privately owned enterprise is one form that private property may take. Types of privately owned business * Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one person. The owner may operate on his or her own or may employ others. The owner of the business has total and unlimited personal liability of the debts incurred by the business. This form is usually relegated to small businesses. * Partnership: A partnership is a form of business in which two or more people operate for the common goal of making profit. Each partner has total and unlimited personal liability of the debts incurred by the partnership. There are three typical different types of classifications for partnerships: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships. * Corporation: A business corporation is a for-profit, limited liability or unlimited liability entity that has a separate legal personality from its members. A corporation is owned by one or more shareholders and is overseen by a board of directors, which hires the business's managerial staff. Corporate models have also been applied to the state sector in the form of government- owned corporations. A corporation may be privately held (\\"close\\", or closely held‚Äîthat is, held by a few people) or publicly traded.

A slungshot is a maritime tool consisting of a weight, or \\"shot\\", affixed to the end of a long cord often by being wound into the center of a knot called a \\"monkey's fist\\". It is used to cast line from one location to another, often mooring line. The cord end is tied to the heavier line and the weighted end of the slungshot is thrown across the intervening space where a person picks it up and pulls the line across. As a weapon The slungshot was often used as a civilian or improvised weapon; however, the rope was much shorter for use as a weapon. The cord is tied around the wrist, and the weight is carried in the hand or the pocket of the user. A slungshot may be swung in a manner similar to that of a flail. ;China and Japan Slungshots were also used in China and Japan, under other names and were sometimes weighted on both ends, such as with Kusari-fundo, manrikigusari, and other variants. A variant called \\"loaded sleeves,\\" consisted of weights concealed in long, flowing sleeves. Robert van Gulik stated in the postscript of his book The Willow Pattern A Judge Dee Mystery, that in 1935 when he was in Peking, he was told how \\"loaded sleeves\\" facilitated an unexpected escape for a group of foreign nuns threatened by a mob during an anti-Western uprising in China. The cornered nuns, believing they were going to be killed, reportedly raised their hands to pray. The people standing nearest incorrectly identified the bulky objects in the upraised folds of cloth, interpreting them to be dangerous \\"loaded sleeves\\". They backed away, opening a path through the crowd, and the nuns escaped. The bulky objects were their breviaries, which the nuns habitually carried in the sleeves of their robes.

This gave them a dubious reputation, similar to that of switchblade knives in the 1950s, and they were outlawed in many jurisdictions. The use as a criminal weapon continued at least up until the early 1920s.

Features and history Located at 79¬∞59'N 99¬∞30'W, it measures in size and is topped with an ice cap. The island is permanently icebound, and its northwestern coast faces onto the open Arctic Ocean. Unlike many Canadian Arctic islands, no traces of Inuit or Thule camps have been found, suggesting the island has never been inhabited, likely due to its extreme northern latitude. In 1909, two Inuit who had participated in Frederick Cook's polar expedition provided a map to Robert Peary that showed they had traveled and spent a night on a then unknown island with the position of Meighen Island. The map and testimony of the Inuit in question were published in an article by Peary in the Chicago Daily Tribune. In 1916, Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Canadian Arctic Expedition sighted and landed on Meighen Island. Stefansson at first believed that he had been the first to discover Meighen Island, but later read Peary's article on the Cook expedition and surmised that Cook had in fact discovered Meighen Island prior to himself. Naming The island was later named after Arthur Meighen, Canadian prime minister 1920-21 and 1926. Neighbouring islands Meighen Island has few neighbours. It is about west of the next nearest major island, Axel Heiberg Island. About to Meighen's north, across the Hose Strait, lies small crescent- shaped Perley Island. The Fay Islands lie between Meighen Island and Axel Heiberg Island within the Sverdrup Channel.

One of the oldest versions of this story is the creation myth of Babylon (the En√ªma Elish) from around 1250 B.C. Walter Wink coined the term as part of an analysis of its impact on modern culture and its role in maintaining oppressive power structures in his book The Powers That Be. Narrative and effect While contrasting the En√ªma Elish with the Genesis creation myth found in the Book of Genesis, Wink examines the psychological effects of each phase of the story. He asserts that every phase of the narrative serves to reinforce the ideology of the status quo and convince us to perpetuate the ruling power structure: Primal chaos The primacy of Tiamat suggests that chaos and evil are the original and natural state of the universe. This can be used to convince us to fear and oppose any threat to the current order, under the assumption that things can only get worse. Superheroes especially have dark origins (for example, the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents and the destruction of planet Krypton), and the pervasiveness of evil is depicted by the resurrection of villains in horror movies and cartoons, the exaggerated presence of violent crime in news coverage, and the overwhelming number and variety of bad creatures in The Lord of the Rings. Tammuz Tiamat and her allies oppress the other gods, who, at first, seem powerless to resist. This acknowledges the effectiveness of alternative systems, and gives us the guilty pleasure of vicariously harming our \\"betters\\" and breaking their rules. However, all this is constrained by the exaggerated flaws of the antagonists, which foreshadow their failure and make us ashamed to identify with them. Horror films tend to emphasize this part of the narrative to the extreme, whereas superhero stories often marginalize it. Heroism Marduk offers to defeat Tiamat in exchange for absolute rule over the remaining gods, and they all agree. This elevates \\"might makes right\\" to a contract made at the beginning of the universe. People are inclined to identify with the hero because of his privileges and his good attributes, and to sympathize with any subsequent oppression. Modern examples include James Bond's license to kill, the gold mine given to Doc Savage's father, Friday's loyalty to Robinson Crusoe, the brazen dishonesty of Jedi knights, the extremes of Jack Bauer, etc. Triumph Marduk slays his enemies in creative, gory, and intricate ways, then goes on to enslave their underlings. This shows that good prevails and evil suffers; the corollary to this is that those who prevail are good. This gives us the catharsis of vengeance and indignation. Once again we can sadistically enjoy a character's suffering, but this time in a sanctioned, acceptable context. The spectacular downfall and glorious victory prompt us to reject the antagonist and reaffirm our commitment to the winning party, respectively. Action movies and video games tend to have a decisive final battle. An opposition leader's death scene often includes ridiculously thorough destruction of his or her body, property, and/or organization, such as Dr. No drowning in the core of his nuclear reactor, which then melts down. Redemption Marduk makes the world from Tiamat's corpse and humanity from the blood of Kingu. This leaves us with the message that our prosperity and even our very existence required past violence and destruction; as Wink puts it, \\"We are the outcome of deicide.\\" This helps justify recent and ongoing violence by appealing to our self-interest. The death or defeat of the antagonist tends to be immediately followed by an idyllic happy ending in simple, violent plots of all stripes. Current examples include the Ewok percussion instrument made from Storm Trooper and other Imperial helmets (or heads) at the end of Return of the Jedi, and the brain surgery Doc Savage uses to turn criminals into productive citizens.  The Two Brothers  The Tale of Two Brothers is an ancient Egyptian story from around the 13th century BCE. The narrative is preserved on the Papyrus D'Orbiney. [Tale of Two Brothers] which had belonged to Seti II (1209-1205 B.C.) of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty when he was crown prince [William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Egyptian Tales: Translated from the Papyri, 1895, p. 66 ] and may have been a political satire based in part on his own difficulties with his half brother, the usurper Amenmesse[J. H. Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Three, ¬ß¬ß 239ff. ], but the historical facts concerning this period are so uncertain as to render such a conclusion speculative. The text has similarities to the story of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, in Genesis 39:1-20, however the relation between the two texts is unclear, if, indeed, there is one.[Shaw, Ian. & Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p. 54\\\\. The British Museum Press, 1995] Further elements of the story seem to be derived from the myths concerning Osiris' death and resurrection.[Erman, Adolph. Life in Ancient Egypt. p. 379\\\\. Dover Publications, 1971. ] The protagonists Anpu and Bata both bear names of gods of the 17th nome of Upper Egypt. Synopsis Bata lives with his married brother Anpu. One day, when Anpu is not at home, his wife tries to seduce Bata, and, having been repelled, accuses Bata of having made advances towards her. Anpu grows angry and wants to kill his younger brother who flees. Pre-Harakhte saves him by creating a body of water full of crocodiles between him and his brother. Bata tells his brother what has occurred and, as proof of his sincerity, cuts off his genitals which are swallowed by a fish. Anpu returns home and kills his wife. Bata lives alone in the wilderness until the gods create a wife for him. Bata loves her very much and reveals to her that his heart is hidden in a pine. Pharaoh, on learning of her existence has her brought to his court. She tells him Bata's secret and he has the pine cut down, killing Bata. Anpu goes to look for his brother, and after finding his body he searches for his heart and finds it after years of searching. Bata is revived and wants to take revenge on his wife. He changes himself into a beautiful bull and his brother takes him to Pharaoh. Bata reveals himself to his wife who has him killed. Two drops of his blood are spilled and from them grow two persea trees, incarnations of Bata. His wife has them felled, but a splinter of their wood enters her mouth, she swallows it and becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, a reincarnation of Bata, who is acknowledged as the Pharaoh's heir. When Pharaoh dies and he becomes king, he has the queen tried and killed. ‚Ä¢ P. D'Orbiney (P. Brit. Mus. 10183), written towards the end of the 19th dynasty by the scribe Ennana.[Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol.2, 1980, p. 203 ] It was acquired by the British Museum in 1857.

The video, having already been shown live, is replayed in order for viewers to see again and analyze what had just taken place. Some sports allow officiating calls to be overturned after the review of a play. Instant replay is most commonly used in sports, but is also used in other fields of live TV. While the first near- instant replay system was developed and used in Canada, the first instant replay was developed and deployed in the United States. History During a 1955 Hockey Night in Canada broadcast on CBC Television, producer George Retzlaff used a \\"wet-film\\" (kinescope) replay, which aired several minutes later. Videotape was introduced in 1956 with the Ampex Quadruplex system. However, it was incapable of displaying slow motion, instant replay, or freeze-frames, and it was difficult to rewind and set index points. The end of the March 24, 1962 boxing match between Benny Paret and Emile Griffith was reviewed a few minutes after the bout ended, in slow motion, by Griffith and commentator Don Dunphy. In hindsight it has been cited as the first known use of slow motion replay in television history. CBS Sports Director Tony Verna utilized a system to enable a standard videotape machine to instantly replay on December 7, 1963, for the network's coverage of the US military's Army‚ÄìNavy Game. The instant replay machine weighed . After technical hitches, the only replay broadcast was Rollie Stichweh's touchdown. It was replayed at the original speed, with commentator Lindsey Nelson advising viewers \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Army did not score again!\\" The problem with older technology was the difficulty of finding the desired starting point; Verna's system used audio tones activated as an interesting event unfolded, which technicians could hear during the rewinding process. Replay from analog disk storage was tried out by CBS in 1965, and commercialized in 1967 by the Ampex HS-100, which had a 30-second capacity and freeze frame capability. Instant replay has been credited as a primary factor in the rise of televised American football, although it was popular on television even before then. While one camera was set up to show the overall \\"live\\" action, other cameras, which were linked to a separate videotape machine, framed close-ups of key players. Within a few seconds of a crucial play, the videotape machine would replay the action from various, close-up angles, in slow motion.Barnouw, E. (1990). Tube of plenty : the evolution of American television / Erik Barnouw. New York : Oxford University Press, 1990. Prior to instant replay, it was almost impossible to portray the essence of an American football game on television. Viewers struggled to assimilate the action from a wide shot of the field, on a small black-and-white television screen. However, as Erik Barnouw says in his book, \\"Tube of Plenty: The Evolution of American Television\\", with replay technology, \\"brutal collisions became ballets, and end runs and forward passes became miracles of human coordination\\". Thanks in large part to instant replay, televised football became evening entertainment, perfected by ABC-TV's Monday Night Football, and enjoyed by a wide audience. Marshall McLuhan, the noted communication theorist, famously said that any new medium contains all prior media within it. McLuhan gave Tony Verna's invention of instant replay as a good example. \\"Until the advent of the instant replay, televised football had served simply as a substitute for physically attending the game; the advent of instant replay ‚Äì which is possible only with the television ‚Äì marks a post-convergent moment in the medium of television\\". In television During the live television transmission of sports events, instant replay is often used to show again a passage of play which was especially important or remarkable, or which was unclear at first viewing. Replays are typically shown during a break or lull in the action; in modern broadcasts, it will be at the next break in play, although older systems were sometimes less instant. The replay may be in slow motion or feature shots from multiple camera angles. Video servers, with their advanced technology, have allowed for more complex replays, such as freeze frame, frame-by-frame review, replay at variable speeds, overlaying of virtual graphics, instant analysis tools such as ball speed or immediate distance calculation. Sports commentators analyze the replay footage when it is being played, rather than describing the concurrent live action. Instant replays are used today in broadcasting extreme sports, where the speed of the action is too high to be easily interpreted by the naked eye, using combinations of advanced technologies such as video servers and high-speed cameras recording at up to several thousand frames per second. EVS Broadcast Equipment is the industry leader in Replay Production Servers https://evs.com/en/collection/production-servers and is the preferred system of major broadcasters for large events such as the Olympics, Super Bowl, MLB Playoffs, and NBA Playoffs. Evertz Microsystem's DreamCatcher DreamCatcher Replay Systems, Evertz Microsystems Ltd. replay system is also widely used for lower level productions by College and Pro Sports clubs including the NBA, MLB. Variant Systems Group's Envivo Replay https://variantsystems.tv/Products/productsindex.html, is also used for lower- level productions by College and Pro Sports including University Of Oregon, Western Michigan University, and the Portland Trail Blazers. Use by officials Some sports organizations allow referees or other officials to consult replay footage before making or revising a decision about an unclear or dubious play. This is variously called video referee, video umpire, instant replay official, television match official, third umpire or challenge. Other organizations allow video evidence only after the end of the contest, for example to penalize a player for misconduct not noticed by the officials during play. The role of the video referee differs varies; often they can only be called upon to adjudicate on specific events. When instant replay does not provide conclusive proof, rules may say whether the original call stands, or whether a specific call must be done (most usually no score). Leagues using instant replay in official decision making include the National Hockey League, National Football League, Canadian Football League, National Basketball Association, and Major League Baseball. It is used international in field hockey and rugby union as well. Since 2017, some association football competitions have employed the use of a \\"Video Assistant Referee\\" (aka \\"VAR\\"). Due to the cost of television cameras and other equipment needed for a video referee to function, most sports only employ them at a professional or top- class level. Baseball Umpires in St.Louis await the ruling. In Major League Baseball, instant replay has been introduced to address \\"boundary calls\\", which include questions on whether or not a hit should be considered a home run (HR). Among reviewable plays are: Fair Ball-HR; Foul Ball, Ball Clearing Wall-HR; Ball Staying in Play-Live Ball; Ball Leaving Field of Play- HR; and, Ball or Player interfered with by spectators (called Spectator Interference). The latest MLB collective bargaining agreement, pending agreement by the umpires' union, expands instant replay to include: Fair Ball; Foul Ball along foul lines, or Ball Caught for Out; Ball Trapped Against Ground or Wall; as well as expanding Interference calls to all walls regardless of whether it is a \\"boundary call\\" or not. In Little League Baseball, Instant Replay was initially adopted for the Little League World Series only but later was expanded to include the qualifying regional tournaments as well. It includes all \\"boundary call\\" plays reviewable at the Major League Level, in addition to adding review to plays involving force outs, tag plays on the basepaths, hit batters, and for defensive appeals regarding whether a runner missed touching a base. Basketball NBA referees reviewing a play In NBA basketball, the officials must watch an instant replay of a potential buzzer beater to determine if the shot was released before time expired. Since 2002, the NBA has mandated installation of LED light strips on both the backboard and the scorer's table that illuminate when time expires, to assist with any potential review. Instant replay first came to NBA in the 2002‚Äì03 season. In Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals, Los Angeles Lakers forward Samaki Walker made a three-point field goal from the half court at the end of the second quarter. However, the replay showed that Walker's shot was late and that the ball was still in his hand when the clock expired. The use of instant replay was instituted afterward. Beginning with the 2007‚Äì08 season, replay also can be used in determining players being ejected from contests involving brawls or flagrant fouls. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, replay may also be used to correctly determine whether a scored field goal is worth two or three points. It may also be used to determine the correct number of free throws awarded for a missed field goal. It may also be used in cases where the game clock malfunctions and play continues to decide how much time to take off the clock. In 2014, the NBA consolidated its replay work in remote instant replay center to support officials in multiple games. In college basketball, the same procedure may also be used to determine if a shot was released before time expired in either half or an overtime period. In addition, NCAA rules allow the officials to use instant replay to determine if a field goal is worth two or three points, who is to take a free throw, whether a fight occurred and who participated in a fight. The officials may also check if the shot was made before the expiration of the shot clock, but only when such a situation occurs at the end of a half or an overtime period. Such rules have required the NCAA to write new rules stating that, when looking at instant replay video, the zeros on the clock, not the horn or red light, determine the end of the game. In Italy, host broadcaster Sky agreed with Serie A to the adoption of instant replay for special tournaments and playoff games, and in 2005, for the entire season. Instant replay would be used automatically in situations similar to the NCAA, but coaches may, like the NFL, have one coach's challenge to challenge a two or three point shot. Officials may determine who last touched the ball in an out-of-bounds situation or back-court violations. The adoption of instant replay was crucial in the 2005 Serie A championship between Armani Jeans Milano and Climamio Bologna. Bologna led the best-of-five series, 2‚Äì1, with Game 4 in Milan, and the home team leading 65‚Äì64, as Climamio's Ruben Douglas connected on a three-point basket at the end of the game to apparently win the Serie A championship. Officials, knowing the 12,000 fans on both sides would learn the fate of the series on their call, watched replays of the shot before determining it was valid. The Euroleague Basketball (company) adopted instant replay for the 2006 Euroleague Final Four and made a rule change determining the lights on the backboard, not the horn, will end a period, thus assisting with instant replay.League officials work with Sky TV for technical progress On April 6, 2006, FIBA announced instant replay for last-second shots would be legal for their competitions. \\"The referee may use technical equipment to determine on a last shot made at the end of each period or extra period, whether the ball has or has not left the player's hand(s) within the playing time\\".FIBA accepts video proof for last second shots Before the beginning of the 2013-2014 NBA season, new instant replay rules were put into effect, saying that it can be used for: block/charge plays; to determine if an off- ball foul occurred before or after a shooting motion began in a successful shot attempt, or if the ball is released on a throw in. They also began to use instant reply to determine correct penalties for flagrant fouls.NBA approves of five new rules changes for 2013-14 season Cricket Cricket also uses an instant replay. It is used in the areas of run outs, stumpings, doubtful catches and whether the ball has crossed the boundary for a six or short of a four. The International Cricket CouncilTrial Playing Condition - Review of Umpiring Decisions decided to trial a referral system during the Indian tour of Sri Lanka through late July and August 2008. This new referral system allows players to seek reviews, by the third umpire, of decisions by the on- field umpires on whether or not a batsman has been dismissed. Each team can make two unsuccessful requests per innings, which must be made within a few seconds of the ball becoming dead; once made, the requests cannot be withdrawn. Only the batsman involved in a dismissal can ask for a review of an \\"out\\" decision; in a \\"not out\\", only the captain or acting captain of the fielding team. In both cases players can consult on-field teammates but signals from off the field are not permitted. A review request can be made by the player with a 'T' sign; the umpire will consult the TV umpire, who will review TV coverage of the incident before relaying back fact-based information. The field umpire can then either reverse his decision or stand by it; he indicates \\"out\\" with a raised finger and \\"not out\\" by crossing his hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his waist three times. The TV umpire can use regular slow-motion, or high-speed camera angles usually called ultra-motion or super-slow replays, the mat, sound from the stump mics and approved ball tracking technology, which refers to Hawk-Eye technology that would only show the TV umpire where the ball pitched and where it hit the batsman's leg and it is not to be used for predicting the height or the direction of the ball. Snicko and Hot Spot can also be used.  Fencing  Video-refereeing is compulsory at World Championships, Grand Prix competitions and at the Olympic Games, and is used when the referee cannot decide if a touch is to be awarded, at request of a player (although only two incorrect video appeals are allowed per player in individual competitions) or if the score is tied in the last point and both lights turn on. There is an assistant official, called \\"video-referee\\", who is watching the live match and helps the referee on the decision through a slow motion replay on a monitor close to the piste. It is specially used to decide the right of way in foil and sabre. To appeal, a player must make a gesture in the form of a rectangle (monitor) to the referee. In individual matches, if the player has appealed twice incorrectly, they can no longer appeal again. Association football VAR monitor at the Estadio Monumental David Arellano Assistant video assistant referees in action during a Saudi Professional League match A Major League Soccer referee reviewing a play using a sideline monitor A VAR decision during an FA Cup match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester. In association football, FIFA did not formally permit video evidence during matches until the 2018 FIFA World Cup, although it had been on trial in various competitions beforehand, and it was permitted for subsequent disciplinary sanctions. The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board \\"agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee\\". In 2005, Urs Linsi, general secretary of FIFA, said: :Players, coaches and referees all make mistakes. It's part of the game. It's what I would call the \\"first match\\". What you see after the fact on video simply doesn't come into it; that's the \\"second match\\", if you like. Video evidence is useful for disciplinary sanctions, but that's all. As we've always emphasised at FIFA, football's human element must be retained. It mirrors life itself and we have to protect it. There have been allegations that referees had made or changed decisions on the advice of a fourth official who had seen the in-stadium replay of an incident. This was denied by FIFA in relation to the Zidane headbutt of Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final, and in relation to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup match between Brazil and Egypt, in which Howard Webb signalled initially for a corner kick but then a penalty kick. It has been said that instant replay is needed given the difficulty of tracking the activities of 22 players on such a large field, FIFA officials approached researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland for help, but came up with nothing that could satisfy the league's stringent requirements. Opponents of instant replay like former FIFA President Sepp Blatter argue that refereeing mistakes add to the \\"fascination and popularity of football.\\" It has been proposed that instant replay be limited to use in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line, since those events are more likely than others to be game-changing. In 2007, FIFA authorized tests of two systems, one involving an implanted chip in the ball and the other using a modified version of Tennis's Hawk-Eye system, to assist referees in deciding whether a ball had crossed over the goal line. The following year, however, the IFAB and FIFA halted testing of all goal-line technology, fearing that its success would lead to its possible expansion to other parts of the game. Sepp Blatter claimed the technologies were flawed and too expensive to be implemented on a widespread basis, adding, \\"Let it be as it is and let's leave (soccer) with errors. The television companies will have the right to say (the referee) was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision ‚Äî a man, not a machine\\". This sudden change of course surprised and angered Paul Hawkins, as the inventor of the Hawk-Eye system had invested a great deal of money into adapting the Hawk-Eye technology to football. In 2009, Hawkins sent an open letter to Blatter refuting the FIFA president's assertion that the Hawk-Eye goal line technology was flawed and arguing that Hawk-Eye met all of the criteria established by the IFAB for a suitable goal line technology system. The controversy over goal line technology was re-ignited in 2009 after Brazil had a potential equalizing goal disallowed during the 2009 Confederations Cup Final; and during the 2010 FIFA World Cup after England's Frank Lampard's shot off the underside of the crossbar during a 4‚Äì1 defeat against Germany was not ruled a goal, despite replays clearly showing it was 60 centimetres over the line. In July 2012, International Football Association Board voted unanimously to officially amend the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) goal-line technology. The technology was used at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In April 2016, it was announced that Serie A was selected by the International Football Association Board to test video replays, which were initially private for the 2016‚Äì17 season, allowing them to become a live pilot phase, with replay assistance implemented in the 2017‚Äì18 season. On the decision, FIGC President Carlo Tavecchio said, \\"We were among the first supporters of using technology on the pitch and we believe we have everything required to offer our contribution to this important experiment\\". In September 2016, the video review system known as Video Assistant Referees (VAR), was first used in an international friendly between Italy and France. The system was implemented at a FIFA World Cup for the first time at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Major League Soccer in the United States introduced VAR in competitive matches during its 2017 season after the 2017 MLS All-Star Game on 2 August 2017. Gridiron football codes Instant Replay booth at Raymond James Stadium Referee (left) talking with the replay official In American and Canadian football, instant replay can take place in the event of a close or otherwise controversial call, either at the request of a team's head coach (with limitations) or the officials themselves. There are restrictions on what types of plays can be reviewed. In general, most penalty calls or lack thereof cannot be reviewed, nor can a play that is whistled dead by the officials before the play could come to its rightful end. American and Canadian football leagues vary in their application and use of instant replay review. In the National Football League, each coach is allowed two opportunities per game to make a coach's challenge, and get a third challenge if both of the original two challenges were successful. A challenge can only be made on certain reviewable calls on plays that begin before the two-minute warning and only when a team has at least one time-out remaining in the half. The Canadian Football League uses similar rules as the NFL, except the game has a three-minute warning near the end of each half instead of two. In NCAA football, each team only has one challenge per game, and gets a second challenge if the first one is successful. U.S. high school rules prohibited the use of replay review, even if the venue had equipment that allows the practice, before 2019, when the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) gave its member associations the option to allow its use in postseason games only. In Texas, where high schools have always based their rules on those of the NCAA, the University Interscholastic League, which governs public-school sports, allows its use only in state championship finals. The main governing body for Texas private schools, the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, follows pre-2019 NFHS practice by banning replay review. Field hockey In field hockey, the International Hockey Federation allows the match umpire to request the opinion of a video umpire as to whether or not a goal has been validly scored, and whether there was a violation in the build-up to a goal. The video umpire can advise on whether the ball crossed the line there was a violation. Ordinarily, teams are not allowed to make such a request or to press the match umpire to do so. On a trial basis, the 2009 Men's Champions Trophy allows for \\"team referral\\" by each team captain, to query a goal, penalty stroke, or penalty corner decision. The team retains the right to a referral if its previous referrals were upheld. FIH Tournament Regulations, p.30: Appendix 6, ¬ß2.2 Ice hockey The video goal judge reviews replays of disputed goals. As the referee does not have access to television monitors, the video goal judge's decision in disputed goals is taken as final. In the NHL, goals may only be reviewed in the following situations: puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired, puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged, puck being directed into the net by hand or foot, puck deflected into the net off an official, and puck deflected into the goal by a high stick (stick above the goal) by an attacking player. The video goal judge also reviews replays to establish the correct time on the game clock. All NHL goals and time remaining on the game clock are subject to review, and although most arenas have a video goal judge, often officials in the Situation Room (also known as the \\"War Room\\") at the NHL office in Toronto make the final decision. = Review challenges= Beginning in the 2015-16 NHL season, instant replay reviews have been expanded to include a coach's challenge. Each coach receives one challenge per game, which requires the use of a timeout. Coaches may only challenge over situations whether the goal should have been disallowed because of goaltender interference or an offside, or whether a goal disallowed because of goaltender interference should be allowed instead. The challenging team retains its timeout and its challenge after every goaltender interference call that has been overturned. There are two situations that happen when a challenge is upheld: *If an offside review is upheld, the challenging team receives a minor penalty for delay of game. *If a goaltender interference review is upheld, the challenging team loses its timeout. Challenges are not allowed during the final minute of regulation, as well as at any point during overtime. In this situation, officials in the Situation Room reviews all instances where the puck entered the net, and then determines the final ruling. However, for reviews that take place during coach's challenges, the on-ice officials determine the final ruling. Motor sports In international motorsport championships, race stewards often use instant replay to decide whether to penalize competitors for avoidable contact or pitlane infractions. NASCAR utilizes instant replay to supplement their electronic scoring system. Video replays are used to review rules infractions and scoring disputes. *Video replay supplements electronic scoring at the finish line (particularly the race winner) in \\"photo finish\\" situations. *Video replay supplements electronic scoring to determine the final positions when a race ends with a caution flag on the last lap or under a green-white-checker finish. *Video replay is used to determine if a car has crossed the pit entrance before the pit was closed for a yellow flag. It also determines if drivers are following pit road speed limits. *Video replay supplements electronic scoring to determine the positions in which cars exit the pits (during cautions). IndyCar also utilizes instant replay for similar reasons. *The most notable use of replay in recent years occurred during the 2008 Peak 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. On the final lap, Scott Dixon and H√©lio Castroneves crossed the finish line side by side, with computer scoring showing Dixon the winner by a margin of 0.0010 seconds. However, video replay evidence clearly showed that the nose of Castroneves' car touched the line first. Castroneves was declared the winner officially by 0.0033 seconds or 12‚Öõ inches, in the second closest finish in the twelve-year history of the series. It was later determined that the deliberate improper installation of Dixon's scoring transponder was the source of the scoring error. *Video replay was also used extensively in the aftermath of the controversial 2002 Indianapolis 500. However, fully conclusive evidence was lacking. Broadcast stations utilize replays to show viewers a crash in greater detail.NASCAR replays with EVS servers Rodeo The Professional Bull Riders, beginning with the 2006‚Äì07 season, has instituted an instant replay review system. A bull rider, a fellow competitor, or a judge may request a replay review by filing a protest to the replay official within 30 seconds of any decision. Any competitor (it does not have to be the rider who is riding the bull in question, as fellow riders can observe the action and spot fouls by bull or rider) may file the complaint to the replay official by sounding a signal at the arena and explaining to the replay official why he is filing the request. The designated replay official (one of the four officials in the arena) may request different angles and/or slow motion, as well as freeze particular frames. The replay judge will use all available technology to assess the call in question and supply his ruling. This includes using his own hand-held stopwatch to time bull rides in case of a clock malfunction, as well as a graphic overlay of the official eight-second clock used in PBR competition that starts when the bull exits the bucking chute. The replay will be used to evaluate timing issues, fouls against the rider for touching the bull or ground with his free hand or using the fence to stay on the bull, or fouls by the bull, such as dragging the rider across the fence. If an appeal is successful, the decision will be overturned and there will be no charge to the individual filing the protest. If the appeal is unsuccessful, a $500 charge is levied against the protester which is donated to PBR charities such as the Western Sports Foundation to assist injured bull riders and western sports athletes. Rugby league Australia vs Great Britain match in the 2006 Rugby League Tri-Nations Since being introduced by the Super League in 1996, video referees have been adopted in Australasia's National Rugby League and international competition as well. In rugby league the video referee can be called upon by the match official to determine the outcome of a possible try. The \\"video ref\\" can make judgements on knock-ons, offside, obstructions, hold- ups and whether or not a player has gone dead, but cannot rule on a forward pass. If a forward pass has gone un-noticed by the on-field officials it must be disregarded by the video ref, as such judgements cannot reliably be made due to camera angle effects. Rugby union Use of video referee by referees was introduced to rugby union in 2001. The laws of the game allow for \\"an official who uses technological devices\\" to be consulted by the referee in decisions relating to scoring a try or a kick at goal. The decision to call on the video referee (now called \\"Television Match Official (TMO)\\") is made by the referee, then the call is made by the replay referee, who takes his place near the press box, the Television Outside Broadcast van, or in more recent years, a centralised office by the organising league. He either tells the pitch referee by radio link-up or by the use of a big screen during televised matches. Unlike in the NFL, a coach cannot challenge a call made by the pitch referee. Tennis Hawk-Eye in use at Wimbledon. In tennis, systems such as Hawk-Eye and MacCAM calculate the trajectory of the ball by processing the input of several video cameras. They can play a computer rendering of the path and determine whether the ball landed in or out. Players can appeal to have the system's calculation used to override a disputed call by the umpire. In March 2008, the International Tennis Federation, Association of Tennis Professionals, Women's Tennis Association and Grand Slam Committee agreed unified challenge rules: a player can make up to three unsuccessful challenges per set, and a fourth in a tie-break. Television broadcasts may use the footage to replay points even when not challenged by a player.

The town of Coen is inland on the Peninsula Developmental Road, the main road on the Cape York Peninsula in far northern Queensland. In the , Coen had a population of 364 people. Geography The locality of Coen is on the eastern side of Cape York Peninsula with the Coral Sea forming its eastern boundary. Part of the northern boundary follows the Archer River, while the Coen River forms part of its western boundary. The Peninsula Developmental Road runs roughly north to south through the locality. History Kaanju (also known as Kaanju and Kandju) is a language of Cape York. The Kaanju language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cook Shire Council. In 1623, Jan Carstensz, the navigator of the ship Pera of the Dutch East India Company named a river on Cape York Peninsula after Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Today that river is known as the Archer River and the name Coen River is given to one of its tributaries. Gold was discovered on the Coen River in 1876. Coen came into being first as a small fort built by gold miners and prospectors in May 1877 but this first gold rush quickly came to an end, and the settlement did not recover until 1883. It became a centre for several small goldmines in the region but, in 1893, the rich Great Northern mine boomed and the town became a more substantial place. Coen Post Office opened on 20 June 1893 (a receiving office had been open from 1888). The Great Northern mine continued operations until 1916 and produced some 52,000 troy ounces (1,617 kg) of gold before it closed. On 3 July 2014, Barry Port retired from the Queensland Police. He was Australia's last Aboriginal police tracker. In his 36 years working for the police, he has tracked criminals, missing people and stowaways. In the 2011 census, Coen had a population of 416 people. Facilities Today Coen provides services to the region, and is an important supply point on the long unpaved road leading to Weipa and other northern communities. It is a popular stopping point for tourists driving to the tip of Cape York - the northernmost part of the Australian mainland. It has an airstrip at Coen Airport ( north of the town), public library, hotel/motel, guest house, two general stores and fuel outlets, hospital, post office, police station, camping grounds, primary school kindergarten, ranger base and more. There is a scheduled air service to Lockhart and Cairns four times a week. Attractions Small gold mine near Coen. 1990 Coen is an ideal destination for birdwatchers: there are good accommodations and a large and varied bird fauna with representatives from rain forest, monsoon forest and coastal forests.

It builds aerial paper nests often in shrubs or trees, and occasionally under the eaves of buildings. It is most common to see this wasp between May and October during its 3.3 month colony cycle. Behaviours of this wasp include nest defense, curling which is believed to function in brood incubation, and gastral vibration which is involved in larval feeding. The median wasp has a halplodiploid sex determination system that results in a high level of relatedness within the colony. This species is not usually aggressive but will sting if they feel their nest is threatened. Most foraging in the nest is done by the workers once the first ones reach adulthood. These workers forage for insects, nectar, and wood for nest construction in temperatures as low as . The median wasp is known to be occasionally affected by the fungus Cordyceps sphecocephala and the Cricket paralysis virus. Taxonomy and phylogeny The median wasp was first classified by Anders Jahan Retzius in 1783. It is part of the genus Dolichovespula, a small genus of only 18 social wasp species including species such as the tree wasp (D. sylvestris), the Saxon wasp (D. saxonica), and the parasitic hornet (D. adulterina). This wasp is part of the subfamily Vespinae which include social wasps, social hornets, and yellow jackets. Description and identification D. media is a medium to large species of wasp around in length with yellow and black stripes on its abdomen. It can be identified by its yellow clypeus with a thin black central line and large areas of yellow behind the eyes and on the ocular sinus. The median wasp also has a shiny black thorax with four yellow spots that are tinted orange or red. Queens are often mistaken for hornets due to their reddish colouration, but can be distinguished by their thoracic spots and deep black color. Distribution and habitat The median wasp has a Palearctic distribution and is found throughout Europe and temperate regions of Asia all the way east to Japan. It prefers temperate climates and high humidity. This species was identified in the United Kingdom for the first time in 1980 after having spread there from continental Europe. It has also been sighted in New Zealand, but it is not known if the wasp is widespread in the area or if this was an isolated occurrence. D. media builds aerial paper nests above ground. These nests are typically found in shrubs, trees, and sometimes under the eaves of buildings. Nests are made of paper that comes from the digestion of wood and are generally wide and tall. Colonies are often found in both urban and rural areas. These wasps prefer to build nests close to the ground where humidity levels are higher as well as in open areas where the nest is subject to large amounts of sunlight. Colony cycle The colony cycle of D. media is about 3.3 months and occurs between early May and the end of August. The nests are initiated in early May when a single queen emerges from her overwintering hibernation site. All queens in the same region tend to emerge from hibernation and initiate nests at about the same time and do not disperse over weeks or months as in some other species. Queen The queen rears about 10 workers by herself and it takes about 30 days for these workers to mature to adults from eggs. The first workers emerge around early June and start small cell building, where males and workers will be reared, and begin foraging for the colony. The colony continues to grow and large cell construction begins in early July which is where the new queens and some males will be raised. A mature median wasp nest will have about 1000 total cells. Around 320 will be small cells, 680 large cells, with an average of 800 wasps reaching adulthood. The first queens will emerge in early August and disperse to find hibernation sites. The rest of the workers, the old queen, and the males will begin to die off with the colony terminating by the end of August. However, workers are sometimes seen as late as early November. Nest structure Nest The median wasp like many other species of wasps builds its nest out of pulp that comes from the digestion of wood. Their nests have been reported to be light yellow or light to dark grey in color depending on the material used to build the nest. These nests are about tall and wide with a thick roof. Mature nests have 2-4 circular or oval shaped combs that are surrounded by a thick envelope. There are two types of elements connecting combs. One is a rigid column down the center of the nest and the other is thin ribbon like pieces between the combs. Both are made of pulp and help to give the nest support. The entrance hole is at the bottom of the nest and often has spiraled sheets of paper surrounding it. The entrance of young nests sometimes consists of a long vestibule, or entry compartment, whose function is unknown. This long vestibule has only been observed in D. media and D. maculata species and tends to disappear as the nest matures. It may function in thermoregulation or defense. This species lives in cooler temperate climates and nests in the open so thermoregulation is a plausible explanation, but so far no other vestibule of this length have been observed in species that live in similar climates. A mature nest will house about 800 mature adults between May and October. Come October the males and workers being to die off and the queen hibernates until next spring when she will begin a new nest. Behaviour Worker rasping wood fibers Foraging In the median wasp foraging activities take place throughout the day and can be done in temperatures as low as . The queen is responsible for all nest construction and foraging until after the first workers emerge from the nest as adults. This means the queen does all of the foraging for about 30 days before workers take over. At the beginning she mainly focuses on collecting fiber for envelope construction, but as the colony begins to develop she allots more time for foraging for food including both flesh and liquid. Workers begin helping with larval feeding and nest development when just a few days old and take their orientation flight at about 5 days old. At this point they begin to take over food and material collection for the nest. These foraging trips can last between a few minutes to one hour, but most are less than 10 minutes in length. As D. media searches for prey it stops for a moment over each flower in contrast to other species such as V. flaviceps which quickly fly up and down each plant. They will fly up to a couple hundred meters to forage for food. Defence This species of wasp is not particularly aggressive. When a young nest is disturbed the foundress will first place her head at the entrance in an alert position. Then she flies quickly around the nest and may fall suddenly to the ground. This falling to the ground has only been observed in Dolichovespula species and its purpose is unclear. When small insects such as ants or spiders crawl on the nest the wasp responds by grabbing them in her mandibles and dropping to the ground. It is usually not necessary for her to try to keep these insects out of the nest as they are rarely seen to try and enter. Once there are some workers in a young nest the queen and workers cooperate to defend it. Curling Curling is one behaviour that is known only in the subfamily Vespinae and has been observed in nine species among three separate genera including the species D. media. Curling is an act of the queen where she curls her body around the pedicel of the nest when resting. The pedicel is the vertical part of the nest that gives it structure and what the combs are built around. This behaviour is almost always preceded by the queen turning around the pedicel before starting to curl. The queen most often curls at the pedicel for several minutes at a time. It is thought that this behaviour functions in brood incubation. This idea is supported by the evidence that the behaviour is present while there are only eggs and larvae in the nest but stops after many of the larvae have pupated. In addition, one study involving Vespa simillima showed that cell wall temperature rose by an average of 2.5-4.0C¬∞ (4.5-7.2 F¬∞) and remained constant during curling. The rise in temperature and timing of the behaviour suggest that it is important in incubation for the offspring while they are eggs and larvae. Heat for later eggs and larvae is believed to be generated by pupa and other larvae as the colony size increases. Gastral vibration and tapping Another behaviour observed in D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly up and down onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behaviour typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae a small amount of flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behaviour that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last from a few seconds to a couple of minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function in the same way as gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding. Genetic relatedness within colonies=Haplodiploidy The median wasp, as in all other Hymenoptera species, produces females from fertilised diploid eggs, but males are produced from unfertilised haploid eggs. This means that although workers are unable to mate they can still produce male offspring. This type of sex determination is known as haplodiploidy. The result is that brothers have a relatedness of 0.5 as expected of full siblings, but sisters have a higher relatedness of 0.75. Sisters receive half of their mother‚Äôs genes as well as all their father‚Äôs genes because all of the sperm he produces are identical. Mothers have a relatedness of 0.5 to both their sons and daughters. Worker-worker relatedness Most Dolichovespula species including D. media mate only once or fertilise most eggs with sperm from a single male. In addition, there are only 1-2 queens per colony. These specific characteristics result in a high level of worker-worker relatedness within the colony. One study estimated this relatedness to be as high as 0.71. This was determined by analysing 20 workers from each of 10 nests at 3 DNA microsatellite locuses. The DNA analysis allowed the researchers to determine if males were queen‚Äôs or workers‚Äô sons and from there calculate an estimated relatedness. There is evidence that workers in this species attempt to reproduce with about 4 reproducing workers per colony that sometimes lay eggs, however, only 7.4% of the male population are produced by the workers. It has been observed that the median wasp participates in worker policing where the queen or other workers throw worker laid eggs out of the nest or otherwise destroy them. All of this information helps to explain the high level of relatedness in the colony and that relatedness helps to explain the eusocial behaviour of these wasps. Worker- queen conflict Conflict often develops between queens and workers of haplodiploid species because workers are more related to their sisters than their brothers or their parental queens. This results in them trying to push the sex ratio so that there are more females produced by the queen than males. At the same time, however, it is best for the queen to keep a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring because she is equally related to both. D. media workers and queens have been observed policing worker laid eggs which helps to push the ratio more towards the females. This may help to keep worker-queen conflict from getting worse since workers do not produce many offspring in the nest. Parasites and pathogens Ophiocordyceps sphecocephala is a type of fungus that is known to attack wasps including D. media. It produces red- yellow fruiting bodies on long white or yellow stalks. It is not known if this fungus kills living wasps or if it simply attacks dead insects, but there is some evidence to suggest that overwintering queens can be infected. Either way this fungus is not a major threat to a wasp colony. A pathogen that has been found to infect the median wasp is the Cricket paralysis virus. This virus causes insects to become paralyzed and die with a nearly 100% mortality rate once infected. Once a nest is infected this virus could quickly destroy the entire colony, however, there is little data documenting how widespread this virus is among D. media. Human importance Median wasps may be considered a pest by some because its nests are usually built in shrubs or on houses where they are easily disturbed. These nests are typically built out in the open and are often destroyed by people. Despite this the species is not very aggressive and tends to fly away instead of attack if disturbed. However, it may sting if it feels its nest is threatened. The sting of the median wasp is comparable to many other wasp species and should be treated with a cold compress and an antihistamine to reduce swelling unless a more serious allergic reaction occurs. D. media is attracted to sweet foods and as such may fly near food when people are eating. Median wasps are easily scared off and do not usually become aggressive. This species is more likely to be seen as a pest when it invades a new area due to its impact on the environment. One example is a median wasp that has been spotted in New Zealand. If the wasp becomes widespread and feeds on native flies, moths, and nectar it will compete for resources with other species. Its large size may also cause alarm in new areas.

Jurong Port, which operates the only multi-purpose port in Singapore, handles bulk, break-bulk and containerised cargo. The port welcomes over 40,000 vessel-calls annually. The port owns and operates its own subzone located in the town of Jurong East in Singapore. History Corporate In 1963, Jurong Port was set up by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) to support the growth of Singapore's first and biggest industrial estate, Jurong Industrial Estate. In 1965, the port officially commenced operations. In 1968, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was set up to drive the industrial estate development in Singapore and Jurong Port became a business division under JTC. On 1 January 2001, Jurong Port was corporatised and became a fully owned subsidiary of JTC Corporation. Infrastructure Jurong Port commenced operations with only two berths. Growing in tandem with the rapid growth of industries in JTC, cargo traffic in Jurong Port passed the million ton mark for the first time in 1970. In 1971, Jurong Port embarked on an expansion programme that provided for four additional deep water general purpose berths, the extension of an existing berth and the addition of warehouses and transit sheds. Further extensions on the five berths were carried out again in 1971. As the Company continued to grow, additional capacity was required and Jurong Port announced the construction and reclamation of Pulau Damar Laut (PDL) in 1989. PDL provided additional land area and created more deepwater multi-purpose berths. In 1996, Singapore went through a land intensification program to increase land utilisation. Resulting from the program was the Jurong Port Cement Terminal, a dedicated common-user cement facility. In 2001, Jurong Port started its Container Terminal on PDL becoming a full-fledged multi-purpose port. In 2008, Jurong Port started the Penjuru Terminal to handle lighterage and shipchandling businesses. It is bounded by Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, Jurong Pier Road, Jurong Island Highway, Seraya Avenue and Sugnei Jurong, including Pulau Damar Laut.

The 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under Kim Jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to Kim Jong-il and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-Korean relations and for the fulfillment of the October 4 Declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do Kim Jong-il's 2012 mission of Strong and Prosperous Nation, continue his and his father Kim Il-sung's legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs. This practice ended in 2013 when Kim Jong- un delivered the first New Year speech on television in 19 years. In June 2018, Rodong Sinmun devoted a four-page feature to the North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, welcoming its results. The article carried the text of the declaration in full. In addition, it mentioned security guarantees and Donald Trump's pledge to cease the joint military exercises with South Korea.

Description To prevent an adversary from using a brute-force attack to find the key used to encrypt a message, the key space is usually designed to be large enough to make such a search infeasible. On average, half the key space must be searched to find the solution. Another desirable attribute is that the key must be selected truly randomly from all possible key permutations. Should this not be the case, and the attacker is able to determine some factor that may influence how the key was selected, the search space (and hence also the search time) can be significantly reduced. Humans do not select passwords randomly, therefore attackers frequently try a dictionary attack before a brute force attack, as this approach can often produce the correct answer in far less time than a systematic brute force search of all possible character combinations. Examples If a key were eight bits (one byte) long, the keyspace would consist of 28 or 256 possible keys. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) can use a symmetric key of 256 bits, resulting in a key space containing 2256 (or 1.1579 √ó 1077) possible keys. In the DES block cipher, 56-bit key is used, resulting in a relatively small key space of size 256 (or 7.2058 x 1016), which, as was demonstrated in 1998, can be searched exhaustively in 56 hours with a desktop computer.

Cornelis van Vollenhoven began his university studies at Leiden at the age of 17, where he would earn many degrees, including: a master's in law (1895), a bachelor's degree in Semitic languages (1896), a master's in political science (1897), and finally his PhD in law and political science (1898). He received a cum laude for his thesis, ‚ÄúScope and content of international law‚Äù (Omtrek en inhoud van het internationale recht), which foreshadows his later focus on the laws of Southeast Asia. After finishing his studies, Van Vollenhoven became the private secretary of J.Th. Cremer, a colonial captain of industry and minister of Colonial Affairs. In 1901 Van Vollenhoven became professor of the Adat Law of the Dutch East Indies at Leiden University. As legal scholar he had enormous influence on his students and colleagues. Several of his students would go on to become prominent scholars in the field of Adat law, including Frederik David Holleman, whose doctorate was supervised by Van Vollenhoven. The University of Amsterdam granted him an honorary doctorate in 1932. Most of his life, Van Vollenhoven focused on the traditional legal system of Indonesia, the Adat. He campaigned for its preservation and dispelled myths of its being quackery and inefficient. He wrote numerous pamphlets on the subject, including \\"The Adat-law of the Netherlands-Indies‚Äù (Het adatrecht van Nederlandsch-Indi√´), which documented the adat traditions of 19 different regions, plus the adat traditions of the Foreign Orientals (vreemde oosterlingen, i.e. Arabs, Chinese, Indians, and the like). Most remarkably, all of his work was done in Leiden, as Van Vollenhoven visited the East Indies only twice‚Äîonce in 1907 and again in 1923. During his life, he was adat's greatest champion, and is still revered by many of the older generations in Indonesia. ‚ÄúThe Man for Adat Law‚Äù, as he was called, died in Leiden in 1933. The Van Vollenhoven Institute for Law, Governance and Society, part of the Leiden Law School, is named after Cornelis van Vollenhoven. References *F.D.E. van Ossenbruggen, 'Prof.mr.

A majority of the islanders live in Rikitea. The island was a protectorate of France in 1871 and was annexed in 1881. History The town's history dates to the era when the island was first settled with people from the Marquesas Islands in 1100 AD. Captain James Wilson of the London Missionary Society arrived in 1797 on Duff, naming the islands after the English Admiral James Gambier who had facilitated his expedition. Before the Catholic missionaries' arrival, cannibalism was practiced under the rule of the local kings. French Picpus priests Father Fran√ßois Caret and Father Honor√© Laval, of the Congregation for the Sacred Hearts, landed here in 1834. They arrived from Chile. Father Hippolyte Roussel, who had arrived at Rikitea with more than 100 Rapa Nui people on 4 July 1871, assumed charge of Laval's Rikitea mission, and served there till he died in 1898. The figure of 9,000, mentioned by some, when Laval arrived is regarded as being hugely exaggerated. In 1825, the population was estimated at 1500. When the missionaries arrived in 1834 they counted 2,124 souls. Increasing contact with the outside world brought contagious diseases to Mangareva savagely decimating the population. There had already been several major epidemics before 1863, including one which is said have killed half the population. The story about Laval driving the population to their deaths was spread by a French judge, Louis Jacolliot, who dabbled in the occult and had a grudge against Laval and wanted to discredit him. For 9,000 people to have lived on the islands, many would have to live on the hillsides due to the small amount of flat ground, but there is no evidence of houses ever being built there. Also, if 8,500 people died because of Laval, there would be that number of graves, or at least mass graves, but there is not. Geography Mont Duff in the background Rikitea is a port town and tourist center situated on Mangareva Lagoon, which contains a number of motu. It is about southeast of Tahiti, to the North of the Tropic of Capricorn. The average elevation of the town is . The total population of the island was 1100 and most of them lived in Rikitea. Two mountains, Mt. Duff () and Mt. Mokoto (), which are approachable by trails, are north of the town. The climb to Duff's peak takes about 90 minutes. The stones found on the hill were used by the ethnic Mangarevans to predict weather and to look for boats headed for the island. The mountain is covered with tall aeho grass. Economy Black pearls are cultured on numerous platforms on both sides of the Mangareva lagoon. The lagoon is full of corals and black-lipped oysters are harvested by the people. The inhabitants are also involved in agriculture and fishing to the minimum level. The church is involved in technical school (CED, \\"Center for Educational Development) to train people in skill trades such as carpentry, mechanics, electricity, and mother-of-pearl shell engraving. Landmarks St. Michael's Cathedral Meteorological station Father Honor√© Laval built 116 stone buildings and arches, and roads were laid. Buildings included a fortified palace with follies as well as St. Michael's Cathedral which has also been characterized as a folly. The structures were built with shaped coral stone blocks. Several of the structures dating to Laval's time still remain, such as the watch towers on the coast and a turret, the remains of the palace built for Maputeoa, the last king of the island. King Maputeoa's crypt is located in the St. Pierre's Chapel behind the neo- Gothic St. Michael's Cathedral. The Couvent Rouru (Rouru Convent), near the southern end of the cemetery, is now in ruins, but housed 60 nuns at one time. There is a carving school near the cathedral at Camika CED which features mother of pearl carvings. Here training is provided in the art of shell engraving. Pendants and barrettes created here can be purchased at the centre‚Äôs sales outlet. Riktea has a large nuclear fall-out shelter which was built at the time of the French atmospheric testing at Moruroa. The town also has post office, a few shops, a military establishment, a medical room, and schools. Accommodation of note includes Chez Pierre et Mariette near the wharf, with three rooms, and Pension Bianca et Benoit, in the southern part of the town. Transportation The town is accessed by air and by ship. The airport is located on Mou Totegegie, NorthEast. From the airport, boats provide the only access to Rikitea. Flights operate from Pape'ete and take four and half hours. Travel by ship originates only from Pape'ete, a journey of 21 days, with stops at four other islands before arriving at the Rikitea. A road circles the entire island.

They have also been retconned into the histories of Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld, Doctor Fate, Kid Eternity, the Phantom Stranger, Shazam, Hawk and Dove and The Sandman. The first Lord of Order to appear in comics was Nabu in More Fun Comics #67 (May 1941) created by Gardner Fox and Howard Sherman. Nabu's first appearance was later retconned to be in More Fun Comics #55 (May, 1940), where he was inside the helmet, though not explicitly stated in the story. However, the concept of the Lords of Chaos and Order was introduced years later. The term never appears in Golden Age stories. The war between Order and Chaos Chaos and Order have been fighting a never-ending battle for aeons, characterized by an endless cycle of reversals for domination back and forth between the two sides. Originally, the struggle was depicted between Good (Order) and Evil (Chaos). However, later interpretations cast it as a struggle between stagnation (Order) and anarchy (Chaos). The two opposing forces are bundles of mystical energy who usually depend on servants to accomplish their goals. They can take physical form by possessing a living being, as in the case of Nabu or Mordru, or empower humans to act as their agents, as in the case of Terataya and T'Charr (a Lord of Order and a Lord of Chaos respectively), who empowered Hawk and Dove to act in their stead. Both sides have otherwise maintained a tenuous balance of power concerning their involvement in outside conflicts. For instance, when the Spectre appealed to the Lords of Order to allow their followers on Earth to join the defense of Earth from a massive invasion orchestrated by the Dominators, he was turned down. They argued that intervening in this conflict would mean that the Lords of Chaos would retaliate by aiding the invaders, thus escalating the battle to a monumentally disastrous scale that would devastate all concerned. A Lord of Order and a Lord of Chaos were also sent to the Dreaming as representatives of their realms. Kilderkin of Order manifested as a lidless box with a servant djinn holding it, and Shivering Jemmy of the Shallow Brigade of Chaos as a young blonde girl with a balloon. Infinite Crisis During the events of Day of Vengeance, Eclipso seduced the Spectre into slaughtering most of Earth's magic users after she claimed that magic was the source of all of Earth's evil. The Spectre's rampage on magic users resulted in the death of the wizard Shazam, the destruction of the Rock of Eternity, and the release of the forces contained within it, which included the Seven Deadly Sins and numerous other demons. In the Day of Vengeance Special, Nabu called together a team of magical beings to stop the Spectre and seal the Seven Deadly Sins. Nabu confronted the Spectre, whose anger grew so great that the Presence took notice and sent the Spectre to his new host. In the process, Nabu died, and with him, the Ninth Age of Magic. Before his death, he gave the helmet of Doctor Fate to Detective Chimp to give to the new Doctor Fate. Although Nabu and his spirit would no longer be a part of the helmet, it would still have significant powers. After a failed attempt by Detective Chimp to put the helmet on, he asked Captain Marvel to throw the helmet down to Earth and let it land where it will, allowing fate to pick the next Doctor Fate. The deaths of the Lords of Order and Chaos caused magic to break down into its basic raw state, triggering the end of the Ninth Age of Magic and the beginning of the Tenth. Amethyst and Mordru are the only known Lords to have survived into the Tenth Age. Members of the Lords of Order and the Lords of Chaos=Lords of Order The most prominent Lord of Order is Nabu, who empowered and occasionally possessed various humans through the Helmet of Nabu who acted as Doctor Fate. Originally, Doctor Fate was depicted as an agent for Order, or the forces of good. When the standings of the sides were revised, Fate's role was changed so that he was now a balancing force between Order and Chaos. The god Tynan from Darkworld was also an agent of balance.

Video games * In Injustice 2, the Lords of Order have decided that humanity is capable of only chaos and aid Brainiac in his campaign to conquer Earth, forcing Doctor Fate to do his bidding. As a result, Kent Nelson finds himself being controlled by Nabu forcing his friends Black Canary and Green Arrow to defeat Doctor Fate and remove his helmet, though Kent is freed from Nabu's influence for the time being he leaves to speak to his masters, warning the pair of the coming threat. Kent tries to reason with Nabu when he forbids him from aiding innocent people, causing Nabu to reveal that the Lords of Order support Brainiac's attack on Earth due to the chaos caused by the conflicts between the Regime and the Insurgency. Batman and Superman later free Kent Nelson after defeating Doctor Fate on Brainiac's ship and Superman destroys his helmet, freeing Kent who is killed by Brainiac. In Doctor Fate's ending, he defies the Lords of Order and defeats Brainiac, however he is forced to go into hiding with the help of his Justice League Dark teammates and is happily reunited with his wife. In Raiden's ending, Raiden assists Batman in defeating Brainiac but after the battle he finds he is unable to save Kent's life. However before dying, Kent reveals that the Lords of Order are responsible for the impending Armageddon conflict as they intent to use it to create a more orderly multiverse. To oppose the Lords of Order and restore balance, Raiden joins forces with Justice League Dark to combat them.

September 29, 2005 \\"For their accomplishments, all three schools this month earned the status of Blue Ribbon School, the highest honor the U.S. Education Department can bestow upon a school.\\" The school plays its football games at Keith Ritchie Field, an open-air stadium located in Calabasas, California, with a capacity of approximately 3,000. The stadium is the home of the Coyotes ‚Äì Calabasas High School's football, track and field and soccer teams. It was also formerly the home field for the USL Premier Development League club, the San Fernando Valley Quakes. The Calabasas High School Theater Program performs in the Performing Arts Education Center. The center opened in 2013. The $18 million building was funded through Measure G, which passed in 2006. The Performing Arts Education Center was designed by architect John Sergio Fisher. The mainstage theater seats 680 people. There is a black box theater in the facility that seats 100 people. The Performing Arts Education Center has won numerous design awards, including a 2012 AIA / SFV Award for Design Excellence and a 2011 Los Angeles Business Council Architectural Award. In 2013 students chose a same-sex couple for homecoming queen and queen.

S. salivarius colonizes (usually in chains) the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans just a few hours after birth, making further exposure to the bacteria harmless in most circumstances. The bacteria is considered an opportunistic pathogen, rarely finding its way into the bloodstream, where it has been implicated in cases of sepsis in people with neutropenia, (a deficiency in white blood cells). S. salivarius has distinct characteristics when exposed to different environmental nutrients. For example, in the laboratory, if a growth medium is used that includes sucrose then S. salivarius is able to use the sucrose to produce a capsule around itself. However, if sucrose is replaced by glucose as on a GYC (glucose, yeast extract, calcium carbonate) plate, S. salivarius is unable to make a capsule from the glucose. More importantly, in the laboratory, S. salivarius can show a distinct clearing on GYC plates. This is because S. salivarius can ferment the glucose yielding lactic acid. Next, the lactic acid actually reacts with the calcium carbonate in the GYC plate, resulting in zones of clearings on the plate. Role as a probiotic Some strains of S. salivarius are being trialed for their use as a probiotic in the prevention of oral infections. Some strains of S. salivarius are found to produce BLIS (Bacteriocin-like Inhibitory Substances) which are antimicrobial peptides. These peptides display interspecies inhibition, and inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes (which causes Strep throat infections). Lozenges containing S. salivarius are marketed to support immunity against more virulent Streptococcus strains. People with this strain of naturally occurring S. salivarius on their tongue have been shown to have fewer Strep throat infections. This is also being investigated for its potential to prevent rheumatic heart disease which is also caused by S. pyogenes. Agglutination of Streptococcus salivarius is often used in the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae  Subspecies  Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, also known as Streptococcus thermophilus, is a subspecies of S. salivarius.

During the early/mid-1930s, it was one of the two airfields (with Liverpool Speke) handling scheduled services for the Merseyside region. Hooton Park was home to No. 610 (County of Chester) Squadron and, post Second World War, to No. 611 (West Lancashire) and No. 663 (AOP) Squadron.Halley (1988) The airfield closed in 1957 after the disbandment of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, but the three pairs of Belfast Truss hangars erected in 1917 survived the closure. The site was bought by Vauxhall Motors, who built their Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant there, which today produces the Vauxhall Astra. A small remaining section of the airfield site is now owned and managed by The Hooton Park Trust. The hangars are also home to The Griffin Trust and an aircraft preservation society named The Aeroplane Collection. Another part of the old airfield, including a length of the old paved runway, perimeter track and the apron used to park Meteor jet fighters, remains in the ownership of The Naylor Trust. A Second World War B1 hangar is also on this site.Smith D.(1981) History=Site background In 1070 William the Conqueror granted the lands of Hooton to Adam de Aldithly. Eventually they passed to the Stanley family through a series of marriages. After the Battle of Bosworth, Hooton had a new hall and the first Lord Derby in Lancashire. A second half-timbered hall was built in 1488. A third, Italianate, hall was constructed circa 1778, but this later sold to cover the Stanley family's gambling debts in 1850. The hall and adjoining land was bought by a Mr. Naylor, a wealthy Liverpool banker, for 82,000 guineas. He spent a further 50,000 guineas on the addition of a 100-foot tower, an art gallery, and a large dining hall. He also built a racecourse, polo ground, heronry, stud farm and a church in Childer Thornton in memory of his first wife. His yacht was moored on the River Mersey, but in the 1890s the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal cut off his access to the river, so he moved to another of his properties in Nottinghamshire. To avoid paying rates the hall was emptied of contents and staff, but the estate continued to be farmed and the racecourse and polo ground remained in use. First World War War was declared on 4 August 1914, and Hooton Park's racecourse was used for the last time some ten days later. The British War Department then requisitioned the estate for use as an army training ground. The hall became a headquarters, hospital, and officers' mess. Lord Derby recruited the first Pals regiments and Hooton became the training ground for the 18th Battalion of the Kings Liverpool Rifles. They left for France, and fought in the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. The War Department built one single and three double aircraft hangars, which were completed in 1917. These hangars had a unique latticed timber roof construction ‚Äì Belfast Trusses - which were originally used in the Belfast shipyards to cover large working areas, and which provided strength at low cost. Hooton Park then became the No. 4 Training Depot Station. The Royal Flying Corps moved in to form the fighter squadrons so badly needed in France, using Sopwith Scouts, Sopwith Dolphins and Avro 504s. Some of the pilots killed in training accidents were buried in the local churchyard at nearby Eastham. Large numbers of American and Canadian pilots were also trained at Hooton Park. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force. By the end of the First World War, the 37 aircraft on charge were moved to RAF Sealand and RAF Hooton Park was closed. During the following years the airfield reverted to farmland. The hangars were empty and the hall was so damaged by military use that it was sold as a redevelopment opportunity. and subsequently demolished (although the racecourse and polo ground remained). Civil aviation between the Wars The airfield site was purchased by Mr. G.H. Dawson, an aviation enthusiast. In the summer of 1927, the Liverpool Corporation held an air pageant at Hooton as part of its civic week. This show was such a success that the Liverpool and District Aero Club was formed. Dawson allowed the new club to use his aerodrome for a fee. After only twelve months the club became one of the most successful in the country, and along with Barton and Woodford Aerodromes was one of the centres for aviation in the north of England. For three years the aerodrome served as Merseyside's Airport. Dawson persuaded two former RAF engineering officers to set up companies at Hooton: Nicholas Comper, whose Comper Aircraft Company designed and built the Comper Swift single-engined sporting monoplane; and Douglas Pobjoy, who designed and manufactured Pobjoy radial engines. Dawson ran into financial trouble, and died in 1933. In the same year, Liverpool Corporation opened Speke airfield across the Mersey as its permanent airport. The flying club subsequently moved there for cheaper hangarage and clubhouse facilities. In March 1933, Comper moved his company to Heston Aerodrome.Smith (2002) In 1934, William Fettis 'Frank' Davison (1899-1949), and his pilot- engineer wife Elsie Joy Muntz (1910-1940) bought Hooton Aerodrome. They set up their own company at Hooton, Utility Airways, which offered joy-riding, air- taxis and some short-distance scheduled flights. When WW2 came, the airfield was returned to military use and all of Davison's aircraft were stored under the old Hooton racecourse grandstand where they were destroyed by an accidental fire. Pobjoy went to work for Short Brothers at Rochester, Kent, but was killed in a mid-air collision in 1946. Despite these setbacks, Hooton was still an important aerodrome, with many private owners and several small airlines continuing to operate out of it. Second World War In 1935, Martin Hearn, an ex-pilot and -ground engineer and who had previously worked for Alan Cobham's Flying Circus as a wing walker and aerial trapeze artist, created Martin Hearn Ltd., employing a few mechanics to service the aircraft using the aerodrome. In 1936 No. 610 (County of Chester) Squadron Auxiliary Air Force was formed at Hooton Park. Most of the pilots took private flying lessons to qualify. One person said, \\"Never have I seen so many Rolls-Royce cars in one spot at the same time\\" ‚Äì an indication of the pilots' typical social status. The unit was initially a bomber squadron equipped with Hawker Hind and Hawker Hart bombers and Avro Tutor trainers. In 1939, the squadron took charge of a number of Fairey Battles, then a flight of Hawker Hurricanes that were quickly replaced by Supermarine Spitfire I's. At the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 the Squadron was mobilised and sent to RAF Wittering. 610 later moved to RAF Biggin Hill, where it took part in the Battle of Britain, becoming one of the most successful fighter squadrons to take part in that action. By the end of the war 610 Squadron had destroyed 132 enemy aircraft and 50 flying bombs. One of its pilots (Sgt. Ray Hamlyn) accounted for five enemy aircraft in one day. In February 1945, another 610 pilot (F/Lt Tony Gaze) flying a Spitfire XIV destroyed a Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter-bomber over Germany. At this time, Martin Hearn obtained a contract from the Ministry of Aircraft Production to repair large numbers of Avro Ansons, and later de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers. As No. 7 Aircraft Assembly Unit, the company's work also included the assembly of various types of US-built aircraft that arrived by ship at the Mersey docks. Aircraft included the North American Mustang, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, plus Douglas Boston and Canadian-built Handley Page Hampden bombers, and North American Harvard trainers. The first Sikorsky helicopters used by the RAF were also assembled and tested at Hooton towards the end of the war. During the war years, Hooton assembled and repaired thousands of aircraft. The RAF operated a flight of Coastal Command Avro Ansons, de Havilland Tiger Moths and de Havilland Hornet Moths on anti- submarine patrols during 1939 and 1940. No. 11 Radio School and No. 3 General Reconnaissance School flew from the airfield. In 1941 the grass airfield was transformed to include a 6,000-foot concrete runway ‚Äì one of the longest in Europe at that time. As aircraft became redundant, they were sent from all over the country to No. 100 Sub Storage Site at Hooton to be scrapped. The end of the Second World War brought a decline in work to Martin Hearn. The company then had to seek peacetime work. To this end, buses were repaired, armoured cars overhauled and Slingsby gliders manufactured. Post-war operations In 1947 Martin Hearn's company was renamed Aero-Engineering and Marine (Merseyside), and Martin Hearn was no longer connected to it. Martin Hearn went into partnership with Lily Belcher, and ran the Glider Club, adjacent to the airfield at its north western corner, as a successful and popular hotel for 25 years. The engineering company survived until 1955, latterly servicing Canadair Sabre jet fighters for the RAF and RCAF. Wing Commander 'Wilbur' Wright opened a flying school at Hooton, and later a gliding club was operated from the northern end of the airfield. The gliding club survived as a local wining and dining venue until 1986. In 1946 No. 610 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force returned to Hooton Park after valiant war service, flying Spitfires in the European theatre. No. 663 (AOP) Squadron was reformed at Hooton Park in 1949, using Auster spotting aircraft. In 1951 No. 610 Squadron received Meteor twin jet fighters, and No. 611 Squadron (West Lancashire) relocated from Woodvale to use the longer Hooton runway required for this type of aircraft. The three squadrons operated as R.Aux.AF units from the airfield until all Auxiliary flying squadrons were disbanded in March 1957. At this point, the station was closed and all flying ceased at RAF Hooton Park. After closure by the RAF The closure of the aerodrome was not the end of the story for Hooton Park ‚Äì it became the site of the north's biggest agricultural show (the Cheshire Show) until 1977, and the runways continued to be used by Shell Research for testing cars at high speed. In 1960 part of the site was purchased by Vauxhall Motors for the construction of a vehicle production plant at Ellesmere Port ‚Äì the first car to roll off the production line being the Vauxhall Viva. Hooton Park Trust In the summer of 1986 Hooton opened its gates for two days to host the 'Wheels 86 Transport Extravaganza'. This event was so successful that four other 'Wheels Shows (1988, 1992, 1994 and 1996) were held. Over 80,000 people attended these events, and many thousands of pounds were donated to charities from the proceeds. For the first time since 1957 the runways were used. Harrier jets thrilled the crowd, and for a few precious hours, cutting edge aviation technology paid homage to this pioneering aviation site. Early in the 1980s, the group of four people organising these events successfully approached the local authority to obtain a preservation order on the three historic World War I hangars. English Heritage bestowed on the three hangars grade II Listed building status in 1985 because of their rarity as a group of three double-bay hangars utilising the Belfast truss form of construction. In the late 1980s this group of four formed themselves into an alliance called The Griffin Trust, and Vauxhall Motors granted them a peppercorn lease on two of the hangars. The third hangar continued to be used to service Vauxhall motor cars. After a great deal of work, the buildings were brought into some semblance of order. Despite many attempts to raise capital for the repair and maintenance of the buildings The Griffin Trust failed to secure any substantial grant funding. On 9 October 2000, The Hooton Park Trust obtained the freehold of the three World War I aircraft hangars, with associated ancillary accommodation and land at Hooton Park. The sale of the freehold concluded twelve months of intensive negotiations between The Hooton Park Trust and Vauxhall Motors. These were entered into in response to Vauxhall Motor's application in September 1998 to the local planning authority (Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council), for Listed Building Consent to demolish the hangars. This created an enormous protest from aircraft enthusiasts and local people, who were determined that the buildings should be saved in recognition of their role in the development of military and civilian aviation. The campaign was also supported by people concerned with the architectural value contained within the site's buildings. Vauxhall Motors and their parent company General Motors, met with representatives of The Hooton Park Trust. The Trust persuaded the car giant of the value of the heritage asset they owned, and as a gesture in recognition of this the freehold was passed to The Hooton Park Trust. The motor giant provided substantial financial support to supplement planned applications for public sector funding as well as support expenses to aid the Trust in the first three years of operation. English Heritage commissioned a thematic review of military aviation sites throughout the United Kingdom in 1998. In that review, Hooton Park was recommended for upgrade to grade II* (two star) listing. Belfast truss hangars were now exceedingly rare, and Hooton Park was in the fortunate position of having three double bay examples set in context with their original ancillary buildings. In March 2003, grade II* (two star) listing was achieved and a scheme of emergency repairs was devised by consultant engineers working on behalf of the buildings owner's. The Hooton Park Trust have secured initial grants from English Heritage, Heritage Lottery Fund and WREN (landfill tax credits), and work was due to begin on restoring the hangars and ancillary accommodation in September 2007. Since that date, there has been a major roof collapse in one of the hangars, potentially endangering its future. Parts of the site remain open to the public, and the Trust offers guided tours to groups and individuals interested in Hooton Park's rich architectural and aviation history. Surviving airfield facilities A section of the main runway, together with a taxi track and apron, survives at the western end of the airfield owned by the Naylor Trust. A private Eurostar light aircraft landed on and later departed from this runway in 2011. The adjacent large World War II B1 type hangar, which was last used for servicing Meteor jet fighters, is now in industrial use. Kart circuit In January 2007, the Hooton Park kart circuit opened after 12 months of construction. The circuit is officially licensed by the Motor Sports Association and race meetings are held on the second Sunday of each month. The races are organised by the Cheshire Kart Racing Club. Since its opening, the circuit has proven to be popular to karters in the North West Region and has played host to several major meetings including the last round of the Motors TV UK Karting Challenge in October 2007. The Circuit is due to host the NKRA Grande Finals in August 2009. the aeroplane collection (tac) tac is one of the oldest aircraft restoration groups in England and has been based at hooton park for quite some time.

The club was given this on the proviso the land be tended to and looked after by the members. In 2018 trees were cut back, grass mown and rubbish removed. A small pool was then built on the land. This pool also acts as an emergency water supply in case of fire. The club are hoping to remain at Hooton for the foreseeable future.

The most common application of ion-selective glass electrodes is for the measurement of pH. The pH electrode is an example of a glass electrode that is sensitive to hydrogen ions. Glass electrodes play an important part in the instrumentation for chemical analysis and physico-chemical studies. The voltage of the glass electrode, relative to some reference value, is sensitive to changes in the activity of certain type of ions.  History  The first studies of glass electrodes (GE) found different sensitivities of different glasses to change of the medium's acidity (pH), due to effects of the alkali metal ions. In 1906, M. Cremer, the father of Erika Cremer, determined that the electric potential that arises between parts of the fluid, located on opposite sides of the glass membrane is proportional to the concentration of acid (hydrogen ion concentration).Cremer, M. √úber die Ursache der elektromotorischen Eigenschaften der Gewebe, zugleich ein Beitrag zur Lehre von Polyphasischen Elektrolytketten. ‚Äî Z.

Lond., 491, 2860. 1928 In 1925, P.M. Tookey Kerridge developed the first glass electrode for analysis of blood samples and highlighted some of the practical problems with the equipment such as the high resistance of glass (50‚Äì150 megohms). During her PhD, Kerridge developed the miniature glass electrode, maximizing the surface area of the tool by heat treating the platinum with platinum chloride at red heat, thus enabling a much larger signal; her design was the predecessor of many of the glass electrodes used today.  Applications  Glass electrodes are commonly used for pH measurements. There are also specialized ion sensitive glass electrodes used for determination of the concentration of lithium, sodium, ammonium, and other ions. Glass electrodes have been utilized in a wide range of applications including pure research, control of industrial processes, analysis of foods and cosmetics, measurement of environmental indicators, and microelectrode measurements such as cell membrane electrical potential and soil acidity.  Types  Almost all commercial electrodes respond to single- charged ions, like H+, Na+, Ag+. The most common glass electrode is the pH- electrode. Only a few chalcogenide glass electrodes are sensitive to double- charged ions, like Pb2+, Cd2+ and some others. There are two main glass- forming systems: silicate matrix based on molecular network of silicon dioxide (SiO2) with additions of other metal oxides, such as Na, K, Li, Al, B, Ca, etc. and chalcogenide matrix based on molecular network of AsS, AsSe, AsTe.  Interfering ions  A silver chloride reference electrode (left) and glass pH electrode (right) Because of the ion-exchange nature of the glass membrane, it is possible for some other ions to concurrently interact with ion-exchange centers of the glass and to distort the linear dependence of the measured electrode potential on pH or other electrode function. In some cases it is possible to change the electrode function from one ion to another. For example, some silicate pNa electrodes can be changed to pAg function by soaking in a silver salt solution. Interference effects are commonly described by the semiempirical Nicolsky-Eisenman equation (also known as Nikolsky- Eisenman equation),D. G.

It is given by :E=E^0 + \\\\frac{RT}{z_iF} \\\\ln \\\\left [ a_i + \\\\sum_{j} \\\\left ( k_{ij}a_j^{z_i/z_j} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] where E is the emf, E0 the standard electrode potential, z the ionic valency including the sign, a the activity, i the ion of interest, j the interfering ions and kij is the selectivity coefficient. The smaller the selectivity coefficient, the less is the interference by j. To see the interfering effect of Na+ to a pH-electrode: :E=E^0 + \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln \\\\left ( a_{\\\\text{H}^+} + k_{\\\\text{H}^+,\\\\text{Na}^+}a_{\\\\text{Na}^+} \\\\right )  Range of a pH glass electrode  The pH range at constant concentration can be divided into 3 parts: Scheme of the typical dependence E (Volt) ‚Äì pH for ion- selective electrode. * Complete realization of general electrode function, where potential depends linearly on pH, realizing an ion-selective electrode for hydronium. :E=E^0 + \\\\frac{2.303RT}{F} \\\\text{pH} where F is Faraday's constant (see Nernst equation). * Alkali error range - at low concentration of hydrogen ions (high values of pH) contributions of interfering alkali metals (like Li, Na, K) are comparable with the one of hydrogen ions. In this situation dependence of the potential on pH become non-linear. The effect is usually noticeable at pH > 12, and concentrations of lithium or sodium ions of 0.1 moles per litre or more. Potassium ions usually cause less error than sodium ions. * Acidic error range ‚Äì at very high concentration of hydrogen ions (low values of pH) the dependence of the electrode on pH becomes non- linear and the influence of the anions in the solution also becomes noticeable. These effects usually become noticeable at pH < -1. Specialized electrodes exist for working in extreme pH ranges. Construction Scheme of typical pH glass electrode. A typical modern pH probe is a combination electrode, which combines both the glass and reference electrodes into one body. The combination electrode consists of the following parts (see the drawing): # a sensing part of electrode, a bulb made from a specific glass # internal electrode, usually silver chloride electrode or calomel electrode # internal solution, usually a pH=7 buffered solution of 0.1 mol/L KCl for pH electrodes or 0.1 mol/L MCl for pM electrodes # when using the silver chloride electrode, a small amount of AgCl can precipitate inside the glass electrode # reference electrode, usually the same type as 2 # reference internal solution, usually 0.1 mol/L KCl # junction with studied solution, usually made from ceramics or capillary with asbestos or quartz fiber. # body of electrode, made from non-conductive glass or plastics. The bottom of a pH electrode balloons out into a round thin glass bulb. The pH electrode is best thought of as a tube within a tube. The inner tube contains an unchanging 1√ó10‚àí7 mol/L HCl solution. Also inside the inner tube is the cathode terminus of the reference probe. The anodic terminus wraps itself around the outside of the inner tube and ends with the same sort of reference probe as was on the inside of the inner tube. It is filled with a reference solution of KCl and has contact with the solution on the outside of the pH probe by way of a porous plug that serves as a salt bridge. Galvanic cell schematic representation This section describes the functioning of two distinct types of electrodes as one unit which combines both the glass electrode and the reference electrode into one body. It deserves some explanation. This device is essentially a galvanic cell that can be schematically represented as: :Glass electrode  Reference Solution  Test Solution  Glass electrode :Ag(s)  AgCl(s)  KCl(aq)  1√ó10‚àí7M H+ solution  glass membrane  Test Solution  junction  KCl(aq)  AgCl(s)  Ag(s) In this schematic representation of the galvanic cell, one will note the symmetry between the left and the right members as seen from the center of the row occupied by the \\"Test Solution\\" (the solution whose pH must be measured). In other words, the glass membrane and the ceramic junction occupies both the same relative place in each respective electrode (indicative (sensing) electrode or reference electrode). The double \\"pipe symbol\\" () indicates a diffusive barrier that prevents (glass membrane), or slowing down (ceramic junction), the mixing of the different solutions. By using the same electrodes on the left and right, any potentials generated at the interfaces cancel each other (in principle), resulting in the system voltage being dependent only on the interaction of the glass membrane and the test solution. The measuring part of the electrode, the glass bulb on the bottom, is coated both inside and out with a ~10 nm layer of a hydrated gel. These two layers are separated by a layer of dry glass. The silica glass structure (that is, the conformation of its atomic structure) is shaped in such a way that it allows Na+ ions some mobility. The metal cations (Na+) in the hydrated gel diffuse out of the glass and into solution while H+ from solution can diffuse into the hydrated gel. It is the hydrated gel, which makes the pH electrode an ion-selective electrode. H+ does not cross through the glass membrane of the pH electrode, it is the Na+ which crosses and leads to a change in free energy. When an ion diffuses from a region of activity to another region of activity, there is a free energy change and this is what the pH meter actually measures. The hydrated gel membrane is connected by Na+ transport and thus the concentration of H+ on the outside of the membrane is 'relayed' to the inside of the membrane by Na+. All glass pH electrodes have extremely high electric resistance from 50 to 500 MŒ©. Therefore, the glass electrode can be used only with a high input-impedance measuring device like a pH meter, or, more generically, a high input-impedance voltmeter which is called an electrometer. Limitations The glass electrode has some inherent limitations due to the nature of its construction. Acid and alkaline errors are discussed above. An important limitation results from the existence of asymmetry potentials that are present at glass/liquid interfaces. The existence of these phenomena means that glass electrodes must always be calibrated before use; a common method of calibration involves the use of standard buffer solutions. Also, there is a slow deterioration due to diffusion into and out of the internal solution. These effects are masked when the electrode is calibrated against buffer solution but deviations from ideal response are easily observed by means of a Gran plot. Typically, the slope of the electrode response decreases over a period of months. Storage Between measurements any glass and membrane electrodes should be kept in a solution of its own ion. It is necessary to prevent the glass membrane from drying out because the performance is dependent on the existence of a hydrated layer, which forms slowly.

The school is at the intersection of West First Street and North Beaudry Avenue. On March 25, 2008, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education voted to name the school as Edward R. Roybal Learning Center for former Congressman Edward R. Roybal, who represented this area in Congress and whose daughter, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, is representing the area. The attached park, named Vista Hermosa Park, opened on July 19, 2008. The first new public park in the downtown Los Angeles area since 1895, it was funded and developed in part by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and is operated by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. The park contains a soccer field that is shared by the school and the surrounding community.New park a sight for sore eyesConservancy Opens New Park Near Downtown Los Angeles The school is part of LAUSD, and opened after years of controversy on Tuesday, September 2, 2008.Central LA HS #11, 55.98107 School Name: Edward R.

BFA is more about involving students with the business atmosphere, ISOL helps students that usually are new to this country and need help with the English language, CSA is more about involving students with the computer atmosphere, and lastly AEE provides their students with a sense of empowerment and helps them get involved. History The project to build the school began in 1997. The northern part of the site had been within the Los Angeles City Oil Field, an industrial area which contained over 1,000 active oil wells around 1900, and a concern of soil contamination‚Äîspecifically, methane and hydrogen sulfide‚Äîwas confirmed during development in 1999. This resulted in a temporary halt to construction. In December 2000 Superintendent Roy RomerLA Times (2006) Generally Speaking, It's Right to Honor Romer saved the project and began reviewing private bids to address the additional issues at the site. In 2002, the \\"Alliance for a Better Community\\" was selected to finish the project.Alliance for a Better Community - History Further complicating the development, in September 2002 an earthquake fault was detected on the northeast portion of the plot. The project was again temporarily suspended.LA Downtown News (2005) Generation Next: Glenn Gritzner In May 2003 the LAUSD voted to finish the school using funds from voter initiative bond Measure K but with certain modifications: inclusion of a park; a 500-seat learning academy; a library; an auditorium; and a parent center. The total project cost was then estimated to be around US$300 million.LAUSD Board Votes to Complete Belmont In December 2004, approximately one third of the buildings were demolished because of the earthquake fault and then construction continued.

History Putney was probably settled during the Roman occupation. Lower Richmond Road was probably a Roman Road, and the Lower Common was probably an open pasture and farmland. Land was apparently lost in the 19th century when Elm Lodge was built. Putney Hospital Funded by legacies from Sir Henry Chester and Sir William Lancaster, Elm Lodge was rebuilt in 1912 as Putney Hospital. Putney Hospital was closed in 1998 and has remained vacant. Wandsworth council has now purchased the hospital and its Children's Services department has intended to build a new primary school on the site since July 2010. 24 flats are being built at the northern end of the site (the nurse's quarters were demolished) to help fund the project. Planning permission for the development of the proposed school and flats was overturned by the High Court in early 2013 over a technicality. Planning permission was subsequently re-granted. The access to the hospital site is proving to be problematic, and an application by a local resident for a judicial review of the sale of the access by the Commons Conservators took place in the High Court in early October, 2013. The Conservators of the Common agreed to sell the access to Wandsworth Council by way of an easement, which, under the 1871 Act that created the Common's legal framework, the resident felt was not legal. The resident lost his case but has appealed. Following the grant of the easement, a strip of common land is to be tarmacked with a new private road to provide access to the school and the luxury flats. In addition, new footpaths, bollards, a remotely controlled barrier and street lighting will be installed, effectively suburbanising the common. As part of the same development, a more substantial portion of common land, currently tarmacked to provide parking for the old hospital, will be returned to grass. Wandsworth Council confirmed to the Commons Conservators that they intended to compulsorily purchase the Common in the event that the Conservators lost the case. The community group Friends of Putney Common continues to oppose the actions of Wandsworth Council, which are opposed by some local residents. In April 2014, Lord Justice Rimer granted an application for the case to proceed to the Court of Appeal; the date for the hearing was set for 30 June 2014. The case raises important points of principle; the protection by an Act of Parliament of Metropolitan Open Land, whether the Conservators may permit the effective appropriation and urbanisation of part of Putney Common and the Conservators duties to preserve the common in its \\"natural state\\". In August 2016 the Charity Commission opened a Statutory Inquiry in the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators, citing mismanagement, misconduct and the undersale of land. A valuation of the access indicated a ¬£1,550,000 loss on the sale which completed in August 2014. As at the end of April 2017, the Statutory Inquiry was ongoing.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-charity-investigation- wimbledon-and-putney-commons-conservators In July 2020, nearly four years after the Inquiry commenced, the Charity Commission published the results of their Statutory Inquiry, concluding that the easement may have been transferred at an undervalue. Charity Commission's Statutory Inquiry Conclusion On 4 August 2020, The Times newspaper published an article suggesting that the Charity Commission‚Äôs Statutory Inquiry was a whitewash, as criticism of the deal and trustees was removed when the report was challenged by lawyers acting for Sir Ian Andrews. In the article the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge questioned whether the Commission was 'fit for purpose', due to the changes. Putney's MP, Fleur Anderson described the report as a 'whitewash'.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/charity-commission-whitewashed- land-sale-inquiry-after-legal-threats- xxvhvbdgm?shareToken=fe6e315188ab3395e4d7dc3605300bf2 Putney Common The common also includes Putney Lower Common Cemetery which was established in 1858. In 1871 the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Act was passed which prevented further building. The Common still provides traditional activities associated with commons before they were overtaken by urbanisation and enclosure - cricket is played in the summer and there is a fairground on bank holidays. In the south-east corner lies All Saints' Church, built in 1874. The number 22 bus route begins at the Spencer Arms, at the North East corner of the common.

The average elevation is . Attractions Chamundi Hills seen from J.P.Nagar Library, Mysore The Chamundeshwari Temple is located atop the Chamundi Hills. Patronised for centuries by Mysore rulers, it was renovated during the time of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1827).  Temple  Chamundeshwari Temple Demon Mahishasura Mysuru from Chamundi Hills Named after the goddess Chamundi, the Chamundeshwari Temple sits atop the main hill. The main hill itself features an ancient stone stairway of 1,008 steps leading to its summit. Approximately halfway to the summit is statue of bull Nandi, the vahana, or \\"vehicle\\" of Lord Shiva, which is 4.9 m tall and 7.6 m long and carved out of a single piece of black granite. Around this point, the steps become significantly less steep and eventually the climber is rewarded with a panoramic view of the city. The Temple has a quadrangular structure. A key feature is the statue of Mahishasura bearing a sword in his right hand and a cobra in the left. Within the temple's sanctum stands a sculpted depiction of Chamundeshwari. She is seated with her right heel pressed against the lowest of the seven chakras. This cross-legged yogic posture echoes the posture of Lord Shiva. Worshipers believe that this powerful yogic posture, if mastered, provides an added dimensional view of the universe. Since the early days of the Maharajahs of Mysore, the idol of goddess Chamundi has been carried on a decorated elephant as part of the celebrations in the annual Dusshera festival. From the peak of the Chamundi hills, the Mysore Palace, the Karanji Lake and several smaller temples are visible. Legend According to a legend, the asura Mahishasura (king of the city that is currently known as Mysore) was killed by goddess Chamundeswari (also called Chamundi) after a fierce battle. The goddess is also called Mahishasura Mardini.Chamundi Hills According to mythology, this rocky hill was known as Mahabalachala. Two ancient temples occupy the hill, the Mahabaleshvara and the Chamundeshvari; the Mahabaleshvara Temple on the hill is the older of the two and is a place of pilgrimage. The car festival and 'Teppotsava' are held there. The influence on the name of Mysuru The name of Mysuru comes from the old Kannada word \\"Mahishooru\\". Mahishooru literally means 'the village of Mahishasura.' The British then modified this name to 'Mysore'. Then, on 1 November 2014, the government of Karnataka changed the name to 'Mysuru'. The hill thus has an indirect influence on the name of the city  Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev  Indian yogi Sadhguru claims to have experienced Spiritual Enlightenment in Chamundi Hill. He claims that, when he was about 25 years old, he was sitting on a rock in Chamundi Hill, and there he experienced a life changing experience in which he experienced everything as himself.

History  A blister pack sold by the piece (ting√≠-ting√¨). The company began on March 1, 1945 with a single drugstore owned by Mariano Que ( ). He named it after Mercury, the messenger of the gods in Roman mythology, whose caduceus is sometimes used as a symbol of medicine. The logo of the drugstore was made by Alfredo Medinaceli Cabrera. The store began cutting packaged, bulk items into single pieces and selling them individually; this practice is colloquially called ting√≠-ting√¨ in Filipino. During its foundation, it is the second oldest established drugstore chain in the country (after South Star Drug, which established in 1937 - eight years earlier). Upon the invitation of Ayala Corporation, Mercury Drug opened its second branch in May 1963 at a developing commercial center in Makati now known as the Ayala Center. In 1965, Mercury Drug established its landmark branch at Plaza Miranda, Quiapo, Manila, which is notable for its large outdoor LED screen. In 2001, then trade secretary Mar Roxas described Mercury drug as a \\"near monopoly\\" and said it has 70 percent share of the domestic market (hence, it is now facing competition from mentioned-above South Star Drug - which the latter eventually acquired by Robinsons Retail in 2012 - and SM-owned Watsons Philippine franchise). As of 2017, Mercury Drug has reportedly over 1000 branches across the country. Recently, it opened a new building, MDC100, located in Eastwood City, Quezon City.

Its main function is the inhibition of the complement system to prevent spontaneous activation but also as the major regulator of the contact system. C1-inhibitor is an acute-phase protein that circulates in blood at levels of around 0.25 g/L. The levels rise ~2-fold during inflammation. C1-inhibitor irreversibly binds to and inactivates C1r and C1s proteases in the C1 complex of classical pathway of complement. MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteases in MBL complexes of the lectin pathway are also inactivated. This way, C1-inhibitor prevents the proteolytic cleavage of later complement components C4 and C2 by C1 and MBL. Although named after its complement inhibitory activity, C1-inhibitor also inhibits proteases of the fibrinolytic, clotting, and kinin pathways. Note that C1-inhibitor is the most important physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, fXIa, and fXIIa.  Proteomics  C1-inhibitor is the largest member among the serpin superfamily of proteins. It can be noted that, unlike most family members, C1-inhibitor has a 2-domain structure. The C-terminal serpin domain is similar to other serpins, which is the part of C1-inhibitor that provides the inhibitory activity. The N-terminal domain (also some times referred to as the N-terminal tail) is not essential for C1-inhibitor to inhibit proteases. This domain has no similarity to other proteins. C1-inhibitor is highly glycosylated, bearing both N- and O-glycans. N-terminal domain is especially heavily glycosylated.  Genetics  The human C1-inhibitor gene (SERPING1) is located on the eleventh chromosome (11q11-q13.1).  Role in disease  Deficiency of this protein is associated with hereditary angioedema (\\"hereditary angioneurotic edema\\"), or swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Also, C4 and C2 cleavage goes unchecked, resulting in auto- activation of the complement system. In its most common form, it presents as marked swelling of the face, mouth and/or airway that occurs spontaneously or to minimal triggers (such as mild trauma), but such swelling can occur in any part of the body. In 85% of the cases, the levels of C1-inhibitor are low, while in 15% the protein circulates in normal amounts but it is dysfunctional. In addition to the episodes of facial swelling and/or abdominal pain, it also predisposes to autoimmune diseases, most markedly lupus erythematosus, due to its consumptive effect on complement factors 3 and 4. Mutations in the gene that codes for C1-inhibitor, SERPING1, may also play a role in the development of age-related macular degeneration. Despite uncontrolled auto-activation, it is important to note that levels of key complement components are low during an acute attack because they are being consumed - indeed, low levels of C4 are a key diagnostic test for hereditary angioedema. This situation is analogous to the low levels of clotting factors found in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).  Medical use = Hereditary angioedema  Blood- derived C1-inhibitor is effective but does carry the risk associated with the use of any human blood product. Cinryze, a pharmaceutical-grade C1-inhibitor, was approved for the use of HAE in 2008. It is a highly purified, pasteurized and nanofiltered plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor product; it has been approved for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. A recombinant C1-inhibitor obtained from the milk of transgenic rabbits, conestat alfa (trade name Ruconest), is approved for the treatment of acute HAE attacks in adults.Drugs.com: Ruconest 2100 U powder for solution for injectionSummary of product characteristics for Ruconest While C1-inhibitor therapy has been used acutely for more than 35 years in Europe in patients with C1-inhibitor deficiency, new methods of treating acute attacks have emerged: a plasma kallikrein inhibitor and the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant. Other products also have been introduced including plasma-derived products such as Berinert and HAEgarda autoinjector.  For other conditions  The activation of the complement cascade can cause damage to cells, therefore the inhibition of the complement cascade can work as a medicine in certain conditions. When someone has a heart attack, for instance, the lack of oxygen in heart cells causes necrosis in heart cells: Dying heart cells spill their contents in the extracellular environment, which triggers the complement cascade. Activation of the complement cascade attracts phagocytes that leak peroxide and other reagents, which may increase the damage for the surviving heart cells. Inhibition of the complement cascade can decrease this damage.  Synthesis  C1-inhibitor is contained in the human blood; it can, therefore, be isolated from donated blood. Risks of infectious disease transmission (viruses, prions, etc.) and relative expense of isolation prevented widespread use. It is also possible to produce it by recombinant technology, but Escherichia coli (the most commonly used organism for this purpose) lacks the eukaryotic ability to glycosylate proteins; as C1-inhibitor is particularly heavily glycosylated, this sialylated recombinant form would have a short circulatory life (the carbohydrates are not relevant to the inhibitor function). Therefore, C1-inhibitor has also been produced in glycosylated form using transgenic rabbits. This form of recombinant C1-inhibitor also has been given orphan drug status for delayed graft function following organ transplantation and for capillary leakage syndrome.

The division of Rh√¥ne-et-Loire was a response to counterrevolutionary activities in Lyon which, by population, was the country's second largest city. By splitting Rh√¥ne-et-Loire, which was the natural economic and, potentially, military hinterland of Lyon, the government sought to protect the French Revolution from the potential power and influence of the counterrevolutionary revolt in the Lyon region. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Rh√¥ne department was enlarged several times by incorporating into it areas from neighboring departments, so that today the two departments of Rh√¥ne and Loire combined are larger than the former Rh√¥ne-et-Loire department. If Rh√¥ne-et-Loire still existed, its population at the 1999 French census would have been 1,799,812 inhabitants, whereas in 1999 the Rh√¥ne department had 1,578,869 inhabitants, and the Loire department had 728,524 inhabitants.

Carter entered the limelight as a child when she lived in the White House during the Carter presidency.  Early life and education Amy Carter was born on October 19, 1967, in Plains, Georgia. In 1970 her father was elected Governor of Georgia, and then in 1976, President of the United States. Amy was raised in Plains until her father was elected governor, whereupon she moved with her family into the Georgia Governor's Mansion and the White House when her father was elected president. Carter attended majority black public schools in Washington during her four years in Washington; first Stevens Elementary School and then Rose Hardy Middle School.Baltimore Sun: \\"Jimmy Carter's first decisions as president-elect...\\" By THEO LIPPMAN JR. January 07, 1993 Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was her nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended. After her father's presidency, Amy Carter moved to Atlanta; her senior year of high school was at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia. Carter attended Brown University but was academically dismissed in 1987, \\"for failing to keep up with her course work\\".\\"Amy Carter ouster by Brown U. told\\", Chicago Sun-Times, July 19, 1987. She later earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (BFA) from the Memphis College of Art and received a master's degree in art history from Tulane University in New Orleans in 1996.  Life in the White House  In January 1977, at the age of nine, Carter entered the White House, where she lived for four years. She was the subject of much media attention during this period, as young children had not lived in the White House since the early 1960s presidency of John F. Kennedy (and would not again do so after the Carter presidency until the inauguration of Bill Clinton, in January 1993, when Chelsea moved in.) left While Carter was in the White House, she had a Siamese cat named Misty Malarky Ying Yang, which was the last cat to occupy the White House until Socks, owned by Bill Clinton. Carter also was given an elephant from Sri Lanka from an immigrant; the animal was given to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Carter attended public schools, including Stevens Elementary School and Hardy Middle School.First choice: why Chelsea Clinton should attend a public school - President-elect Bill Clinton's daughter Carter roller-skated through the White House's East Room and had a treehouse on the South Lawn. When she invited friends over for slumber parties in her treehouse, Secret Service agents monitored the event from the ground. 228x228px Carter did not receive the \\"hands off\\" treatment that most of the media later afforded to Chelsea Clinton. President Carter mentioned his daughter during a 1980 debate with Ronald Reagan, when he said he had asked her what the most important issue in that election was and she said, \\"the control of nuclear arms\\". Once, when asked whether she had any message for the children of America, Amy replied with a simple \\"no\\".Miller, Danny (January 25, 2006). \\"I Heart Amy Carter\\". The Huffington Post Controversy resulted when Carter was seen reading a book during a state dinner at the White House, which was seen as being offensive to foreign guests.  Activism  Carter later became known for her political activism. She participated in a number of sit- ins and protests during the 1980s and early 1990s that were aimed at changing U.S. foreign policy towards South African apartheid and Central America. Along with activist Abbie Hoffman and 13 others, she was arrested during a 1986 demonstration at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for protesting CIA recruitment there. She was acquitted of all charges in a well-publicized trial in Northampton, Massachusetts. Attorney Leonard Weinglass, who defended Abbie Hoffman in the Chicago Seven trial in the 1960s, utilized the necessity defense, successfully arguing that because the CIA was involved in criminal activity in Central America and other hotspots, preventing it from recruiting on campus was equivalent to trespassing in a burning building.  Personal life  Carter illustrated The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer, her father's book for children, published in 1995. In September 1996, Carter married computer consultant James Gregory Wentzel, whom she had met while attending Tulane; Wentzel was a manager at Chapter Eleven, an Atlanta bookstore, where Carter worked part-time. Carter kept her own family name and the couple moved to the Atlanta area, where they focused on raising their son, Hugo James Wentzel (b. 1999). Since the late 1990s, Carter has maintained a low profile, neither participating in public protests nor granting interviews. She is a member of the board of counselors of the Carter Center that advocates human rights and diplomacy as established by her father.

The permit is issued by the Bureau of Exit and Entry Administration of the Ministry of Public Security through China Travel Service sub-branches in Hong Kong and Macau and allows holders to travel freely to Mainland China. The name \\"Home Return Permit\\" was chosen because it was used by Chinese √©migr√©s in Hong Kong and Macau for visits to their families in Mainland China. Most holders of this permit are people with permanent residence status in Hong Kong and/or Macau, and the permit served as a de facto identification card for Hong Kong and Macau residents in mainland China until the Residence Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents was issued in September 2018. Eligibility The Home Return Permit, under the guideline of the China Travel Service which serves as the authorized agent as the receiver of application in Hong Kong and Macau, is issued to:È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ±ÖÊ∞ëÁî≥È†ò„ÄäÊ∏ØÊæ≥Â±ÖÊ∞ë‰æÜÂæÄÂÖßÂú∞ÈÄöË°åË≠â„Äã(ÂõûÈÑâË≠â) È†àÁü•„ÄäÊ∏ØÊæ≥Â±ÖÊ∞ë‰æÜÂæÄÂÖßÂú∞ÈÄöË°åË≠â„ÄãËæ¶Ë≠âÈ†àÁü• *Permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macau possessing Chinese Nationality by birth or naturalization in one of these regions; *Mainland residents who have been approved by mainland authorities to immigrate to Hong Kong or Macau and have already established residency in one of these regions (also known as one-way permit holders); *Permanent residents of Hong Kong and Macau born in a country or region other than Hong Kong or Macau and possess Chinese nationality by birth, descent or naturalization. The permit is only issued by the Exit and Entry Administration of the Ministry of Public Security, and all applications must be made in either Hong Kong, Macau or mainland China. Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can be issued Chinese Travel Documents when abroad, albeit with a shorter validity period. History From left to right: HKSAR passport, Home Return Permit (Cancelled), and the 1999 version of the certificate Back of the previous version, the lack of English descriptions can cause difficulties when travelling by air outside the Greater China Region. Before the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong and Macau, \\"home-return permits\\" were issued to any ethnic Chinese person in those territories. Prior to 1999, those permits were named Home-visiting Certificate for Compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau and was a passport-like booklet. These booklets were considered inconvenient, because they were relatively cumbersome to carry around. Furthermore, the booklets were also found to be inefficient because they could only be used at manned border crossing checkpoints where an entry stamp would be placed by an immigration official. Frequent border crossing residents, such as lorry drivers, were required to replace the booklet every few months due to the lack of pages for entry and exit stamps. The booklets were eventually phased out. In 1999, the permit was changed into its current credit-card-like form and the official name has also changed to its current name, following the handover of sovereignty of both territories. A new version came to circulation in 2013 with enhanced security features and an embedded biometric chip. Appearance The current and older permits are credit card- sized which makes it more efficient to carry in one's wallet. The older permit is also machine readable, which facilitates entry into Mainland China at any manned immigration checkpoint or through self-service immigration gates (currently available at Hong Kong-Shenzhen, Macau-Zhuhai crossings, Beijing West Railway Station, and international airports throughout Mainland China). These gates scan the permits with an optical reader and use the software to verify one's biometric informations, such as thumb prints and facial scans, with the database. After the inspection is completed, the person is released. Starting from 2 January 2013, the current version of the permit came to circulation. The design of newer permits has been changed. A biometric chip, like the one used on biometric passports, was added to the permit. The numbering scheme of the permit has been revamped: the previous 11-digit permit number has been separated to a 9-digit permit number and a 2-digit issuing sequence number. The permits now also have an English description which reads \\"This card is intended for its holder to travel to the mainland of China\\", and it was added because holders of the older version may have difficulties to board flights outside the Greater China Region as no English description was given on the older permit. The Simplified Chinese name of holder on his or her Hong Kong or Macau Identity Card appears on the front of the permit, whereas the original Traditional Chinese name of holder appears on the back of the permit. The issuing authority of this permit have been changed from Public Security Bureau of Guangdong to the Bureau of Exit and Entry Administration of the Ministry of Public Security. Validity Most permits for adults are valid for 10 years; minors under 18 years old are issued permits valid for five years. Temporary permits are given for certain reasons, such as when a person's permit has expired and the replacement has not arrived. There have been instances of limited single and double entry home visit permits issued due to political reasons. Requirements when staying in Mainland China Holders of the Home Return Permit are able to freely enter Mainland China for all purposes within the validity of their travel document, regardless whether the point of origin is Hong Kong, Macau, or overseas. However, they must register with the local Public Security Bureau within 24 hours -- or within 72 hours in the countryside -- if they are staying overnight in a friend or relative's home.Ê∏ØÊæ≥Â±ÖÊ∞ëËµ¥ÂÜÖÂú∞ÊâãÁª≠ÂäûÁêÜÊåáÂçó (Information page from the Central People's Government in Chinese) Retrieved on 2008-10-20. Those residing in the Mainland for more than six months may apply for the Residence Permit for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Residents. Applying for a Home Return Permit The China Travel Service (CTS) is the sole authorized agency by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) to provide services to help accept applications in Hong Kong and Macau. However, the PSB of Guangdong processes all applications and issues the permit on behalf of the Ministry of Public Security. Holders who have lost their Home Return Permit in Mainland can apply for a temporary replacement at the CTS branch in Huanggang. They will, however, need to apply for a new Home Return Permit on return to Hong Kong or Macau with the CTS. Hong Kong and Macau Chinese Nationals in foreign countries, who do not already have a Home Return Permit, can apply to their local Chinese foreign mission for a passport-like Chinese Travel Document to visit Mainland China.È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ±ÖÊ∞ëÊóÖË°åËØÅ‰ª∂ (Information page from the Chinese Embassy in London in Chinese) Retrieved on 2008-10-20.Êæ≥Èó®Â±ÖÊ∞ëÊóÖË°åËØÅ‰ª∂ (Information page from the Chinese Embassy in London in Chinese) Retrieved on 2008-10-20. Nationality of holders A home return permit constitutes proof of Chinese nationality in Mainland China. Its status in Hong Kong law is less clear, due to the principle of one country, two systems and the designation of the Hong Kong Immigration Department as the competent authority to determine matters under the Chinese Nationality Law relating to Hong Kong permanent residents. As Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Wally Yeung wrote:; the applicant was found on appeal to be a Chinese national, but in overturning Yeung's judgment the court did not disturb this point. :Mr. Pun has also emphasized that the fact that Yiu Hon holds a Home Visit Permit shows that the Chinese Government recognizes Yiu Hon has the status as a Chinese national. I do not understand the principle on which the Chinese Government issued Yiu Hon a Home Visit Permit. However, under the principle of one country, two systems, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will not be subject to the decision of the Chinese Government on the above question. The Court shall decide whether or not Yiu Hon is still a 'Chinese national' in accordance with the Chinese Nationality Law and related provisions. The fact that Yiu Hon holds a Home Visit Permit has no direct bearing or significance on the matter in question. Furthermore, not all Chinese nationals in Hong Kong or Macau have a Home Return Permit. Unlike the compulsory Hong Kong Identity Card, application for a Home Return Permit is voluntary. Those who do not apply for the Permit are still eligible for an HKSAR passport issued by the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, or an MSAR passport by the Identification Services Bureau of Macau. The SAR passports are only issued to Chinese nationals with the right of abode in Hong Kong or Macau. The HKSAR passport allows the holder to travel to other countries and regions, but it may not be used for travelling to Macau. The HKSAR passport is also used as a travel document for travel to Taiwan in conjunction with the Exit and Entry Permit issued by the government of Republic of China. Chinese nationals holding an HKSAR passport cannot use it to enter Mainland China, and the HKSAR Government has stated that \\"in line with the one country principle, it was considered inappropriate to adopt HKSAR passport as a travel document to enter the Mainland.\\"HK Gov. \\" Legco.\\" LegCo Panel on Security. Retrieved on 2007-04-03. Likewise, the Home Return Permit cannot be used to enter Hong Kong or Macau, and residents are required to use their Hong Kong Identity Card or a Macau Resident Identity Card. Issues faced by British passport holders Many, but not all, residents of Hong Kong are dual Chinese nationals and British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)s). The PRC Government does not recognise BN(O) passports issued to Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent. They cannot use their BN(O) passports to enter Mainland China before or after the handover. If a person in Hong Kong is a British citizen but not a Chinese national, they can only enter the mainland with a British passport affixed with a Chinese visa, although they may be eligible for brief group tourist trips to the Pearl River Delta and Hainan Province, or visits to mainland cities while in transit to and from other countries or regions (including Hong Kong). Issues faced by other foreign passport holders Besides BN(O) status, British citizenship and Chinese nationality, many residents of Hong Kong have obtained citizenship in countries such as Australia, Canada, or the United States. Officially speaking, if they have not made a \\"declaration of change of nationality\\" at the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, they are regarded by the Chinese authorities as Chinese nationals. In this case, they can use their Home Return Permits to enter Mainland China instead of their foreign passports. Under the master nationality rule, persons entering Mainland China with a Home Return Permit are Chinese nationals and are accordingly not entitled to foreign consular protection. Incidents=Ching Cheong In 2005, Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based journalist of the Singapore-based newspaper The Straits Times, was arrested by the Chinese Ministry of State Security and was accused of stealing \\"state secrets\\". The correspondent entered Mainland with his Home Return Permit while holding a BN(O) passport. Since he is both a Chinese national, a British National (Overseas), as well as a permanent resident of Singapore, organisations like the Hong Kong Journalists' Association and Reporters Without Borders, urged the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to intervene. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it had no plans to comment on the case. British officials have indicated that if there were any representations to be made, they would take place behind the scenes. A London spokesperson confirmed: \\"We can offer consular assistance but we cannot interfere in the legal affairs of another country.\\" The Chinese Central People's Government never recognized any British National (Overseas) status, and stated that its nationals from Hong Kong cannot enjoy foreign consular protection on Chinese soil on the basis of holding foreign passports. The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom stated that \\"Mr Ching is a British National (Overseas) passport holder and we have pressed the central authorities for information on the circumstances of his arrest and will continue to seek consular access as a matter of urgency, which so far has been denied.\\" There were other cases that the British Government was asked to assist BN(O) passport holders detained in Mainland China.HKhrc. \\" HKhrc.\\" Local Human Rights Issues.

During the election campaign, Henry Tang pledged that if he became the next Chief Executive, he would talk to Beijing to secure a new permit for Ho.\\"ÂîêËã±Âπ¥‰Ωï‰øä‰ªÅÂ§æÊìäÂØ∏ÁàÜÊ¢ÅÊåØËã±\\".

Archived from the original on 23 March 2012 Leung Chun-ying gave a more generic response that did not answer to Ho specifically, and said if he became the next Chief Executive, he welcomes anyone to seek his help.  Umbrella movement  Three members of the Hong Kong Federation of Students led by Alex Chow, who had booked air tickets to Beijing to put their case in front of the national leadership during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, found out through airline agents that Chinese authorities had revoked their Home Return Permit, effectively banning them from travelling to Mainland. No official notification of the revocation or explanation of the grounds for their cancellation were ever made to the holders.  Lee Bo  In 2016, issues regarding the disappearances of Lee Bo, the owner of Causeway Bay Books, were raised by British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as Lee is a British citizen with a Home Return Permit who was later confirmed to be kidnapped from Hong Kong by Chinese law enforcement officials. Hammond demanded the Chinese government to launch a thorough investigation regarding the breach of independent jurisdiction rights enjoyed by Hong Kong. The Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi responded by saying that China would refuse to do so because Lee is, \\"first and foremost, a Chinese citizen (national)\\" under the Chinese nationality law and the Basic Law of Hong Kong, therefore the British government would have no say on internal affairs of China. This case came under international attention because, unlike Ching Cheong, Lee was neither arrested or had any charges against him in Mainland China, and his British citizen status, unlike Ching's BN(O), was recognized by the Chinese government.

Natterer was the zoologist on the expedition and was accompanied by other naturalists including Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. Johann Natterer remained in South America for 18 years, until 1835, returning to Vienna with a large collection of specimens, including new species such as the South American lungfish, which he gave to the Imperial Natural-Science Cabinet (K.k. Naturaliencabinet), the predecessor of the Naturhistorisches Museum. Natterer did not publish an account of his travels, and his notebooks and diary were destroyed in the Hofburg fire of 1848 during the Vienna Revolution; however, his specimen collections of 60,000 insects were a part of the \\"Brazilian museum\\" in the \\"Harrach' house\\" and escaped the fire. A number of animals are named after Johann Natterer, including Natterer's slaty antshrike and Natterer's bat. Three species of reptiles are named in his honor: Lystrophis nattereri, Philodryas nattereri, and Tropiocolotes nattereri.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Natterer\\", p. 187).  Family and early life  Natterer's birthplace in Laxenburg Johann Natterer was born on 9 November 1787, the son of the animal-zoologist Joseph Natterer Sr. and Maria Anna Theresia Schober (his mother), the daughter of a master baker from Laxenburg. He had a brother (Joseph Natterer, 1776‚Äì1852). Joseph Natterer Sr. was the last mounted falconer of Austria. When Emperor Franz I dissolved the falconry (Falknerei) in Laxenburg, he bought the collection of Joseph Natterer Sr. This contained numerous domestic birds, mammals, and insects, and Franz I assigned it the further support and the development of the collection. \\"Johann Natterer - Wikipedia\\" (German article), German Wikipedia, 2006, De.Wikipedia.org webpage: DeWikipedia-Johann-Natterer. The collection was brought in 1794 to Vienna and incorporated in the Tiercabinet with the k.k physical-astronomical as well as the Kunstcabinet. The collection was soon made accessible to the public, however without scientific or didactic value. Joseph Natterer Sr. introduced both his sons to the collection and brought to the art of preparing Ausbalgens and chase. His oldest son, Joseph, began his career as a volunteer aide and terminated as first Kustos, Johann became in 1808 freiwilliger coworkers. Johann Natterer initially attended a Piarist school; however in 1794, he transferred to a normal school and completed high school (gymnasium) there. From 1802 to 1803, Johann Natterer attended the material academy and heard scientific lectures at the university.

Located at 9 45' south latitude and 139 W longitude, it is the largest island of the southern Marquesas group. Around 2,200 people reside on the island. A volcano, Temetiu, is Hiva Oa's highest point with . According to local religion, the gods created the Marquesas as their home. Therefore, all islands have names that are related with the building of a house - Hiva Oa means long ridgepole. Overview Hiva Oa. View of Ta'a Oa Bay from the road between Atuona and Puamau. Administratively, Hiva Oa is part of the commune (municipality) of Hiva-Oa, itself in the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands. Atuona, on the coast of Hiva Oa island, is the administrative centre of the commune. Atuona was formerly the seat of government for all of the Marquesas Islands, but it has been replaced by Taiohae on Nuku Hiva island. The island is famous as the final home of French painter Paul Gauguin and Belgian singer Jacques Brel, both of whom are buried in Calvary Cemetery, overlooking Atuona. It is also home to the largest tiki sculptures in French Polynesia. In late pre-European times, the island was nearly evenly divided into two provinces‚ÄîNuku in the west, and Pepane in the east. Geography Hiva Oa is the largest and most fertile of the southern Marquesas islands and second only to Nuku Hiva in size. Similar to all the larger Marquesas, Hiva Oa features steep cliffs abruptly rising from the ocean to a rugged interior spine of volcanic mountains, ridges, and deep, isolated valleys. Unlike most other Polynesian islands near the equator, no fringing coral reefs protect Hiva Oa from the pounding of the ocean and only a few sheltered anchorages and sandy beaches are scattered around the coast. Travel along the shoreline is by boat as most of the coastal terrain is too rugged for roads. A few dirt roads traverse the interior and link seacoast villages and settlements.Gillespie, Thomas W. \\"Marquesas Islands: Tropical Dry Forests of the Pacific\\" http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/geog/tdfpacific/marquesas_islands.html, accessed 4 Dec2013; Google Earth Atuona Airport is located at an elevation of on a plateau near the center of the island and has an asphalt-surfaced runway long with daily flights to other Marquesas islands and Tahiti.http://www.airgorilla.com/airports/pacific/french-polynesia/hiva-oa- marquesas-hix.html, accessed 4 Dec 2013 The outstanding geologic characteristic of Hiva Oa is the collapsed volcano Temetiu. Semi-circular Ta'a Oa bay, also called the Bay of Traitors, is in the crater of the volcano whose walls rise sharply above the bay. Within Ta'a Oa are Atuona Bay and adjacent Taha Uku which are the best anchorages on the island.

Climate  Temperatures in the Marquesas are stable year around, but precipitation is highly variable. Precipitation is much greater on the north and east (windward) parts of the islands and much less on the western (leeward) parts.

It measures the change in the cost of a representative sample of retail goods and services. As the RPI was held not to meet international statistical standards, since 2013 the Office for National Statistics no longer classifies it as a \\"national statistic\\", emphasising the Consumer Price Index instead. However, as of 2018 the UK Treasury still uses the RPI measure of inflation for various index-linked tax rises. History RPI was first calculated for June 1947, largely replacing the previous Interim Index of Retail Prices. It was once the principal official measure of inflation. It has been superseded in that regard by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).National Statistics Online . 2008-10-14. Retrieved 2008-10-22 The RPI is still used by the government as a base for various purposes, such as the amounts payable on index-linked securities including index-linked gilts, and social housing rent increases. Many employers also use it as a starting point in wage negotiation. Since 2003, it is no longer used by the government for the inflation target for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee nor, from April 2011, as the basis for the indexation of pensions of former public sector employees. , the UK state pension is indexed by the highest of the increase in average earnings, CPI or 2.5% (\\"the triple lock\\"). The highest annual inflation since the introduction of the RPI came in June 1975, with an increase in retail prices of 26.9% from a year earlier. By 1978 this had fallen to less than 10%, but it rose again towards 20% over the following two years before falling again. By 1982, it had fallen below 10% and a year later was down to 4%, remaining low for several years until approaching double figures again by 1990. Aided by a recession in the early 1990s, increased interest rates brought inflation down again to an even lower level. From March to October 2009, the change in RPI measured over a 12-month period was negative, indicating an overall annual reduction in prices, for the first time since 1960.Inflation measure turns negative , BBC News, 21 April 2009 The change in RPI in the 12 months ending in April 2009, at ‚àí1.2%, was the lowest since the index started in 1948.Threat of deflation as retail price index falls to lowest-ever level , The Times, 20 May 2009 Housing associations lobbied the government to allow them to freeze rents at current levels rather than reduce them in line with the RPI, but the Treasury concluded that rents should follow RPI down as far as ‚àí2% per annum, leading to savings in housing benefit.Landlords lose rent cuts battle, Inside Housing, 10 July 2009 In February 2011, annual RPI inflation jumped to 5.1% putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates despite disappointing projected GDP growth of only 1.6% in 2011. The September 2011 figure of 5.6%, the highest for 20 years, was described by the Daily Telegraph as \\"shockingly bad\\". After a thorough review, in 2012 the National Statistician's Consumer Prices Advisory Committee (CPAC) determined that due to the use of the Carli formula in certain subcomponents, the RPI is biased upwards compared to other indices by a \\"formula effect\\" of roughly one percentage point. CPAC concluded that \\"the use of the Carli formula is no longer appropriate\\" due to the weak axiomatic properties of the Carli method. (The weak property is the fact that after a price bounce and a subsequent full return to original prices, the Carli method shows positive aggregate inflation.). In 2013, following a consultation on options for improving the RPI, the National Statistician concluded that the formula used to produce the RPI does not meet international standards and recommended that a new index known as RPIJ be published. Subsequently ONS decided to no longer classify RPI as a \\"national statistic\\".RPI no longer an official national statistic ‚Äì UKSA, John Greenwood, MoneyMarketing, 18 March 2013 However, ONS will continue to calculate RPI, among several versions of the inflation index, in order to provide a consistent historic inflation time series. The index factors continue to be used to adjust for inflation in the calculation of chargeable (capital) gains for inclusion in the tax computation for entities subject to corporation tax in the UK. In January 2018, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, said that RPI should be abandoned. Calculation CPI with the Average Earnings Index also included The annual rate of change of the three indexes shows the volatility of the RPI measure, which is one of its disadvantages The United Kingdom RPI is constructed as follows: #A base year or starting point is chosen. This becomes the standard against which price changes are measured. #A list of items bought by an average family is drawn up. This is facilitated by the Living Costs and Food Survey. #A set of weights are calculated, showing the relative importance of the items in the average family budget ‚Äì the greater the share of the average household bill, the greater the weight. #The price of each item is multiplied by the weight given to the item, so that the contribution of the item's price is in proportion to its importance. #The price of each item must be found in both the base year and the year of comparison (or month). This enables the percentage change to be calculated over the desired time period. The RPI calculation employs a variation of the Carli method rather than the Jevons method employed in the calculation of RPIJ and CPI. The unweighted Carli method overstates inflation rates. However as stated above, the RPI calculation employs weights, which remove this overstatement. In practice the comparison is made over shorter periods, and the weights are frequently reassessed. Detailed information is published on the Office for National Statistics website. The RPI includes an element of housing costs, whereas the following items are not included in the CPI: Council tax, mortgage interest payments, house depreciation, buildings insurance, ground rent, solar PV feed in tariffs and other house purchase cost such as estate agents' and conveyancing fees. A further index, CPIH, has been published which includes housing costs but CPIH does not meet current international standards. The Office for National Statistics states that: > The Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) is > the most comprehensive measure of inflation. It extends the Consumer Prices > Index (CPI) to include a measure of the costs associated with owning, > maintaining and living in one's own home, known as owner occupiers'. CPI is usually lower, though this is due more to the differences in the calculation formulas for the indices than to the differences in coverage. The UK Government announced in the June 2010 budget that CPI would be used in place of RPI for uprating of some benefits with effect from April 2011. Regarding state pensions, the UK government confirmed in their autumn statement in 2011 that these would go up by the greater of the CPI, average earnings, or 2.5%. The variability of the change in RPI, due to fluctuations in mortgage interest rates, is shown in the graph on the right. This was one of the arguments used in favour of changing to RPIX. Variations Variations on the RPI include the RPIX, which removes the cost of mortgage interest payments, the RPIY, which excludes indirect taxes (VAT) and local authority taxes as well as mortgage interest payments, and the RPIJ which uses the Jevons (geometric) rather than the Carli (arithmetic) method of averaging.

The work is influential in feminism, women's studies, and lesbian and gay studies, and has also enjoyed widespread popularity outside of traditional academic circles. Butler's ideas about gender came to be seen as foundational to queer theory and the advancing of dissident sexual practices during the 1990s. Summary Butler criticizes one of the central assumptions of feminist theory: that there exists an identity and a subject that requires representation in politics and language. For Butler, \\"women\\" and \\"woman\\" are categories complicated by factors such as class, ethnicity, and sexuality. Moreover, the universality presumed by these terms parallels the assumed universality of the patriarchy, and erases the particularity of oppression in distinct times and places. Butler thus eschews identity politics in favor of a new, coalitional feminism that critiques the basis of identity and gender. She challenges assumptions about the distinction often made between sex and gender, according to which sex is biological while gender is culturally constructed. Butler argues that this false distinction introduces a split into the supposedly unified subject of feminism. Sexed bodies cannot signify without gender, and the apparent existence of sex prior to discourse and cultural imposition is only an effect of the functioning of gender. Sex and gender are both constructed. Examining the work of the philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray, Butler explores the relationship between power and categories of sex and gender. For de Beauvoir, women constitute a lack against which men establish their identity; for Irigaray, this dialectic belongs to a \\"signifying economy\\" that excludes the representation of women altogether because it employs phallocentric language. Both assume that there exists a female \\"self-identical being\\" in need of representation, and their arguments hide the impossibility of \\"being\\" a gender at all. Butler argues instead that gender is performative: no identity exists behind the acts that supposedly \\"express\\" gender, and these acts constitute, rather than express, the illusion of the stable gender identity. If the appearance of ‚Äúbeing‚Äù a gender is thus an effect of culturally influenced acts, then there exists no solid, universal gender: constituted through the practice of performance, the gender \\"woman\\" (like the gender \\"man\\") remains contingent and open to interpretation and \\"resignification\\". In this way, Butler provides an opening for subversive action. She calls for people to trouble the categories of gender through performance. Discussing the patriarchy, Butler notes that feminists have frequently made recourse to the supposed pre-patriarchal state of culture as a model upon which to base a new, non-oppressive society. For this reason, accounts of the original transformation of sex into gender by means of the incest taboo have proven particularly useful to feminists. Butler revisits three of the most popular: the anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss's anthropological structuralism, in which the incest taboo necessitates a kinship structure governed by the exchange of women; Joan Riviere's psychoanalytic description of \\"womanliness as a masquerade\\" that hides masculine identification and therefore also conceals a desire for another woman; and Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic explanation of mourning and melancholia, in which loss prompts the ego to incorporate attributes of the lost loved one, in which cathexis becomes identification. Butler extends these accounts of gender identification in order to emphasize the productive or performative aspects of gender. With L√©vi-Strauss, she suggests that incest is \\"a pervasive cultural fantasy\\" and that the presence of the taboo generates these desires; with Riviere, she states that mimicry and masquerade form the \\"essence\\" of gender; with Freud, she asserts that \\"gender identification is a kind of melancholia in which the sex of the prohibited object is internalized as a prohibition\\" (63) and therefore that \\"same-sexed gender identification\\" depends on an unresolved (but simultaneously forgotten) homosexual cathexis (with the father, not the mother, of the Oedipal myth). For Butler, \\"heterosexual melancholy is culturally instituted as the price of stable gender identities\\" (70) and for heterosexuality to remain stable, it demands the notion of homosexuality, which remains prohibited but necessarily within the bounds of culture. Finally, she points again to the productivity of the incest taboo, a law which generates and regulates approved heterosexuality and subversive homosexuality, neither of which exists before the law. In response to the work of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan that posited a paternal Symbolic order and a repression of the \\"feminine\\" required for language and culture, Julia Kristeva added women back into the narrative by claiming that poetic language‚Äîthe \\"semiotic\\"‚Äîwas a surfacing of the maternal body in writing, uncontrolled by the paternal logos. For Kristeva, poetic writing and maternity are the sole culturally permissible ways for women to return to the maternal body that bore them, and female homosexuality is an impossibility, a near psychosis. Butler criticizes Kristeva, claiming that her insistence on a \\"maternal\\" that precedes culture and on poetry as a return to the maternal body is essentialist: \\"Kristeva conceptualizes this maternal instinct as having an ontological status prior to the paternal law, but she fails to consider the way in which that very law might well be the cause of the very desire it is said to repress\\" (90). Butler argues the notion of \\"maternity\\" as the long- lost haven for females is a social construction, and invokes Michel Foucault's arguments in The History of Sexuality (1976) to posit that the notion that maternity precedes or defines women is itself a product of discourse. Butler dismantles part of Foucault's critical introduction to the journals he published of Herculine Barbin, an intersex person who lived in France during the 19th century and eventually committed suicide when she was forced to live as a man by the authorities. In his introduction to the journals, Foucault writes of Herculine's early days, when she was able to live her gender or \\"sex\\" as she saw fit as a \\"happy limbo of nonidentity\\" (94). Butler accuses Foucault of romanticism, claiming that his proclamation of a blissful identity \\"prior\\" to cultural inscription contradicts his work in The History of Sexuality, in which he posits that the idea of a \\"real\\" or \\"true\\" or \\"originary\\" sexual identity is an illusion, in other words that \\"sex\\" is not the solution to the repressive system of power but part of that system itself. Butler instead places Barbin's early days not in a \\"happy limbo\\" but along a larger trajectory, always part of a larger network of social control. She suggests finally that Foucault's surprising deviation from his ideas on repression in the introduction might be a sort of \\"confessional moment\\", or vindication of Foucault's own homosexuality of which he rarely spoke and on which he permitted himself only once to be interviewed. Butler traces the feminist theorist Monique Wittig's thinking about lesbianism as the one recourse to the constructed notion of sex. The notion of \\"sex\\" is always coded as female, according to Wittig, a way to designate the non-male through an absence. Women, thus reduced to \\"sex\\", cannot escape carrying sex as a burden. Wittig argues that even the naming of the body parts creates a fiction and constructs the features themselves, fragmenting what was really once \\"whole\\". Language, repeated over time, \\"produces reality-effects that are eventually misperceived as 'facts'\\" (115). Butler questions the notion that \\"the body\\" itself is a natural entity that \\"admits no genealogy\\", a usual given without explanation: \\"How are the contours of the body clearly marked as the taken- for-granted ground or surface upon which gender signification are inscribed, a mere facticity devoid of value, prior to significance?\\" (129). Building on the thinking of the anthropologist Mary Douglas, outlined in her Purity and Danger (1966), Butler claims that the boundaries of the body have been drawn to instate certain taboos about limits and possibilities of exchange. Thus the hegemonic and homophobic press has read the pollution of the body that AIDS brings about as corresponding to the pollution of the homosexual's sexual activity, in particular his crossing the forbidden bodily boundary of the perineum. In other words, Butler's claim is that \\"the body is itself a consequence of taboos that render that body discrete by virtue of its stable boundaries\\" (133). Butler proposes the practice of drag as a way to destabilize the exteriority/interiority binary, finally to poke fun at the notion that there is an \\"original\\" gender, and to demonstrate playfully to the audience, through an exaggeration, that all gender is in fact scripted, rehearsed, and performed. Butler attempts to construct a feminism (via the politics of jurido-discursive power) from which the gendered pronoun has been removed or not presumed to be a reasonable category. She claims that even the binary of subject/object, which forms the basic assumption for feminist practices‚Äî\\"we, 'women,' must become subjects and not objects\\"‚Äîis a hegemonic and artificial division. The notion of a subject is for her formed through repetition, through a \\"practice of signification\\" (144). Butler offers parody (for example, the practice of drag) as a way to destabilize and make apparent the invisible assumptions about gender identity and the inhabitability of such \\"ontological locales\\" (146) as gender. By redeploying those practices of identity and exposing as always failed the attempts to \\"become\\" one's gender, she believes that a positive, transformative politics can emerge.

Publication history Gender Trouble was first published by Routledge in 1990. Later that year, a second edition was published by Routledge. In 2006, a Routledge Classics edition was published. Reception Gender Trouble was reviewed by Shane Phelan in Women & Politics. The work has enjoyed widespread popularity outside of traditional academic circles, even inspiring an intellectual fanzine, Judy!MacFarquhar, Larissa, \\"Putting the Camp Back into Campus,\\" Lingua Franca (September/October 1993); see also Judith Butler, \\"Decamping,\\" Lingua Franca (November‚ÄìDecember 1993). Butler, in a preface to the second edition of the book, writes that she was surprised by the size of the book's audience and its eventual status as a founding text of queer theory. Anthony Elliott writes that with the publication of Gender Trouble, Butler established herself at the forefront of feminism, women's studies, lesbian and gay studies, and queer theory. According to Elliott, the core idea expounded in Gender Trouble, that \\"gender is a kind of improvised performance, a form of theatricality that constitutes a sense of identity\\", came to be seen as \\"foundational to the project of queer theory and the advancing of dissident sexual practices during the 1990s.\\" On November 23, 2018, the playwright Jordan Tannahill read the entirety of Gender Trouble outside the Hungarian Parliament Building in protest of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's decision to revoke accreditation and funding for gender studies programs in the country.\\"No problem: a Canadian writer protested against the abolition of gender studies at Parliament\\". Merce, November 24, 2018.\\"On a Friday for seven hours, a Canadian writer in Parliament was reading one of the most well-known books of gender studies\\". 444, November 24, 2018.

The Disappointment Islands () are a subgroup of the Tuamotu Archipelago in French Polynesia. They are located towards the northeast, away from the main Tuamotu group. The Disappointment Islands are a small group of coral islands, which includes the island of Tepoto and the atoll of Napuka. Puka-Puka, to their southeast, is often included in this subgroup.Photo satellite des √éles du D√©sappointement (Archipel des Tuamotu) These islands are arid, and are not especially conducive to human habitation.  Demographics  The Disappointment Islands are sparsely populated. The inhabitants are overwhelmingly native Polynesians. According to the 2002 census, the population of the islands is as follows: * Tepoto: 54 * Napuka: 257 * Puka- Puka: 197  Administration  Administratively Tepoto Island belongs to the commune of Napuka, while Puka-Puka has its own commune. History The western Disappointment Islands, Tepoto and Napuka, were colonized by voyagers from the neighboring Tuamotus, but Puka-Puka was colonized by settlers from the Marquesas Islands, several hundred kilometres to the northeast. The first European to see these islands was Ferdinand Magellan in his 1520 expedition to the Philippines and the Spice Islands. He called them the \\"Unfortunate Islands\\" (Islas Infortunadas) because his sailors could not find a water source there from which to replenish, while en route to the Philippine Islands.Origin of the name (in German) Further European contact with Napuka Atoll only took place again two centuries later, in 1765, with British explorer John Byron. He named Napuka and Tepoto \\"Disappointment Islands\\" because he found the natives to be hostile toward him. The islands were also visited by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1839.

Common examples are mail order catalogues, direct marketing, report generation, price lists and telephone directories. The database content can be in the form of text and pictures but can also contain metadata related to formatting and special rules that may apply to the document generation process. Database publishing can be incorporated into larger workflows as a component, where documents are created, approved, revised and released. The basic idea is using database contents like article and price information to fill out pre-formatted template documents. Templates are typically created in a normal desktop layout application where certain boxes or text are designated as placeholders. These placeholders are then targeted with new content which flows in from the database. This allows for quick generation of final output and, in case of changes to the database, quickly perform updates, with limited or no manual intervention. Another model of database publishing is found in many web-to- print sites where users browse templates from an online catalog (such as business cards or brochures), personalize the selected template by filling in a form and then view the rendered result. In this case the initial source of data is from user input, but it is captured in a database so that if the same user revisits the site later, they can resume editing where they left off. The form is then pre-filled from the database-stored variables the user entered before. The main layout applications for this workflow are: Datalogics Pager, Adobe FrameMaker / InDesign, QuarkXPress, Xyvision, Arbortext Advanced Print Publisher (formerly 3B2) and priint:suite. Generally, these layout applications have a corresponding server version, which receives commands via web interfaces rather than desktop interaction. QuarkXPress Server and Adobe InDesign Server both take full advantage of the design features available in their respective desktop versions. These applications make their broad spectrum of features available for extension and integration with vertical products, that can be developed either internally, through some form of scripting (e.g. JavaScript or AppleScript for InDesign), or externally, through some API and corresponding developer kits. Other variants of database publishing are the rendering of content for direct PDF output. This approach prevents manual intervention on the final output, since PDF is not (comfortably) editable. This may not be perceived as a limitation in situations like report generation where manual editability is not needed or not desired.

Queer Pulp: Perverted Passions from the Golden Age of the Paperback (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2001), p. 104. The book focuses on the events in the life of an American man living in Paris and his feelings and frustrations with his relationships with other men in his life, particularly an Italian bartender named Giovanni whom he meets at a Parisian gay bar. Giovanni's Room is noteworthy for bringing complex representations of homosexuality and bisexuality to a reading public with empathy and artistry, thereby fostering a broader public discourse of issues regarding same-sex desire.Bronski, Michael, ed. Pulp Friction: Uncovering the Golden Age of Gay Male Pulps. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2003, pp. 10‚Äì11. Inspiration An argument can be made that David resembles Baldwin in Paris as he left America after being exposed to excessive racism. David, though not a victim of racism like Baldwin himself, is an American who escapes to Paris. However, when asked if the book was autobiographical in an interview in 1980, Baldwin explains he was influenced by his observations in Paris, but the novel wasn't necessarily shaped by his own experiences: \\"No, it is more of a study of how it might have been or how I feel it might have been. I mean, for example, some of the people I have met. We all met in a bar, there was a blond French guy sitting at a table, he bought us drinks. And, two or three days later, I saw his face in the headlines of a Paris paper. He had been arrested and was later guillotined. That stuck in my mind.\\"Baldwin, James, and Fred L. Standley. Conversations with James Baldwin, University of Mississippi, 1996, p. 205. Plot David, a young American man whose girlfriend has gone off to Spain to contemplate marriage, is left alone in Paris and begins an affair with an Italian man, Giovanni. The entire story is narrated by David during \\"the night which is leading me to the most terrible morning of my life,\\" when Giovanni will be executed. Baldwin tackles social isolation, gender and sexual identity crisis, as well as conflicts of masculinity within this story of a young bisexual man navigating the public sphere in a society that rejects a core aspect of his sexuality. Part one summary David, in the South of France, is about to board a train back to Paris. His girlfriend Hella, to whom he had proposed before she went to Spain, has returned to the United States. As for Giovanni, he is about to be guillotined. David remembers his first experience with a boy, Joey, who lived in Brooklyn. The two bonded and eventually had a sexual encounter during a sleepover. The two boys began kissing and making love. The next day, David left, and a little later he took to bullying Joey in order to feel like a real man. David now lives with his father, who is prone to drinking, and his aunt, Ellen. The latter upbraids the father for not being a good example to his son. David's father says that all he wants is for David to become a real man. Later, David begins drinking, too, and drinks and drives once, ending up in an accident. Back home, the two men talk, and David convinces his father to let him skip college and get a job instead. He then decides to move to France to find himself. After a year in Paris, penniless, he calls Jacques, an older homosexual acquaintance, to meet him for supper so he can ask for money. (In a prolepsis, Jacques and David meet again and discuss Giovanni's fall.) The two men go to Guillaume's gay bar. They meet Giovanni, the new bartender, at whom Jacques tries to make a pass, until he gets talking with Guillaume. Meanwhile, David and Giovanni become friends. Later, they all go to a restaurant in Les Halles. Jacques enjoins David not to be ashamed to feel love; they eat oysters and drink white wine. Giovanni recounts how he met Guillaume in a cinema, how the two men had dinner together because Giovanni wanted a free meal. He also explains that Guillaume is prone to making trouble. Later, the two men go back to Giovanni's room and they have sex. Flashing forward again to the day of Giovanni's execution, David is in his house in the South of France. The caretaker comes round for the inventory, as he is moving out the next day. She encourages him to get married, have children, and pray. Part two summary David moves into Giovanni's small room. They broach the subject of Hella, about whom Giovanni is not worried, but who reveals the Italian's misogynistic prejudices about women and the need for men to dominate them. David then briefly describes Giovanni's room, which is always in the dark because there are no curtains and they need their own privacy. He goes on to read a letter from his father, asking him to go back to America, but he does not want to do that. The young man walks into a sailor; David believes the sailor is a gay man, though it is unclear whether this is true or the sailor is just staring back at David. A subsequent letter from Hella announces that she is returning in a few days, and David realizes he has to part with Giovanni soon. Setting off to prove to himself that he is not gay, David searches for a woman with whom he can have sex. He meets a slight acquaintance, Sue, in a bar and they go back to her place and have sex; he does not want to see her again and has only just had her to feel better about himself. When he returns to the room, David finds a hysterical Giovanni, who has been fired from Guillaume's bar. Hella eventually comes back and David leaves Giovanni's room with no notice for three days. He sends a letter to his father asking for money for their marriage. The couple then runs into Jacques and Giovanni in a bookshop, which makes Hella uncomfortable because she does not like Jacques's mannerisms. After walking Hella back to her hotel room, David goes to Giovanni's room to talk; the Italian man is distressed. David thinks that they cannot have a life together and feels that he would be sacrificing his manhood if he stays with Giovanni. He leaves, but runs into Giovanni several times and is upset by the \\"fairy\\" mannerisms that he is developing and his new relationship with Jacques, who is an older and richer man. Sometime later, David runs into Yves and finds out Giovanni is no longer with Jacques and that he might be able to get a job at Guillaume's bar again. The news of Guillaume's murder suddenly comes out, and Giovanni is castigated in all the newspapers. David fancies that Giovanni went back into the bar to ask for a job, going so far as to sacrifice his dignity and agree to sleep with Guillaume. He imagines that after Giovanni has compromised himself, Guillaume makes excuses for why he cannot rehire him as a bartender; in reality they both know that Giovanni is no longer of interest to Guillaume's bar's clientele since so much of his life has been played out in public. Giovanni responds by killing Guillaume in rage. Giovanni attempts to hide, but he is discovered by the police and sentenced to death for murder. Hella and David then move to the South of France, where they discuss gender roles and Hella expresses her desire to live under a man as a woman. David, wracked with guilt over Giovanni's impending execution, leaves her and goes to Nice for a few days, where he spends his time with a sailor. Hella finds him and discovers his bisexuality, which she says she suspected all along. She bitterly decides to go back to America. The book ends with David's mental pictures of Giovanni's execution and his own guilt. Characters *David, a blond American and the protagonist. His mother died when he was five years old. *Hella, David's girlfriend. They met in a bar in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. She is from Minneapolis and moved to Paris to study painting, until she threw in the towel and met David by serendipity. Throughout the novel David intends to marry her. *Giovanni, a young Italian man who left his village after his girlfriend gave birth to a dead child. He works as a waiter in Guillaume's gay bar. Giovanni is the titular character whose romantic relationship with David leads them to spend a large amount of the story in his apartment. Giovanni's room itself is very dirty with rotten potatoes and wine spilled across the place. *Jacques, an old American businessman, born in Belgium. *Guillaume, the owner of a gay bar in Paris. *The Flaming Princess, an older man who tells David inside the gay bar that Giovanni is very dangerous. *Madame Clothilde, the owner of the restaurant in Les Halles. *Pierre, a young man at the restaurant. *Yves, a tall, pockmarked young man playing the pinball machine in the restaurant. *The Caretaker in the South of France. She was born in Italy and moved to France as a child. Her husband's name is Mario; they lost all their money in the Second World War, and two of their three sons died. Their living son has a son, also named Mario. *Sue, a blonde girl from Philadelphia who comes from a rich family and with whom David has a brief and regretful sexual encounter. *David's father. His relationship with David is masked by artificial heartiness; he cannot bear to acknowledge that they are not close and he might have failed in raising his son. He married for the second time after David was grown but before the action in the novel takes place. Throughout the novel David's father sends David money to sustain himself in Paris and begs David to return to America. *Ellen, David's paternal aunt. She would read books and knit; at parties she would dress skimpily, with too much make-up on. She worried that David's father was an inappropriate influence on David's development. *Joey, a neighbor in Coney Island, Brooklyn. David's first same-sex experience was with him. *Beatrice, a woman David's father sees. *The Fairy, whom David met in the army, and who was later discharged for being gay. Major themes= Social Alienation  One theme of Giovanni's Room is social alienation. Susan Stryker notes that prior to writing Giovanni's Room, James Baldwin had recently emigrated to Europe and \\"felt that the effects of racism in the United States would never allow him to be seen simply as a writer, and he feared that being tagged as gay would mean he couldn't be a writer at all.\\" In Giovanni's Room, David is faced with the same type of decision; on the surface he faces a choice between his American fianc√©e (and value set) and his European boyfriend, but ultimately, like Baldwin, he must grapple with \\"being alienated by the culture that produced him.\\"  Identity  In keeping with the theme of social alienation, this novel also explores the topics of origin and identity. As English Professor Valerie Rohy of the University of Vermont argues, \\"Questions of origin and identity are central to James Baldwin‚Äôs Giovanni‚Äôs Room, a text which not only participates in the tradition of the American expatriate novel exemplified by Stein and, especially, by Henry James but which does so in relation to the African-American idiom of passing and the genre of the passing novel. As such, Giovanni‚Äôs Room poses questions of nationalism, nostalgia, and the constitution of racial and sexual subjects in terms that are especially resonant for contemporary identity politics.Rohy, Valerie, \\"Displacing Desire: Passing, Nostalgia, and Giovanni‚Äôs Room.\\" In Elaine K. Ginsberg (ed.), Passing and the Fictions of Identity, Durham: Duke University Press, 1996, pp. 218‚Äì32.  Masculinity  David grapples with insecurities pertaining to his masculinity throughout the novel. He spends much of his time comparing himself to every man he meets, ensuring that his performative masculine allows him to \\"pass\\" while negotiating the public sphere. For David, masculinity is intertwined with sexual identity, and thus he believes that his same-sex desires act against his masculinity. Baldwin seems to direct the source of his toxic masculinity towards David's father, as he takes on many of his father's problematic traits. David craves an authority figure and blames his father's lack of authority and responsibility for many of his struggles throughout the novel. This comes to a head when David drunk-drives (a habit he assigns to his father) and is involved in an accident. When his father arrives all he can say is: \\"I haven't done anything wrong have I?\\". This ends his relationship with his father and cements his toxic masculine behaviours.  Manhood  The phrase 'manhood' repeats throughout the book, in much the same ways that we find masculinity manifesting itself. The difference between the two themes, in this case, is that David's manhood seems to be more to do with his sexual relationships, whereas his masculinity is guided by learned public behaviours he claims to inherit from his father. The self-loathing and projecting that ensues seems to depict the final blow to a man who was already a great amount of dysphoria. Baldwin's positioning of manhood within the narrative align it also with nationhood, sexuality and all facets of performance within the public sphere. Josep Armengol linked Baldwin's description of manhood as a way of him navigating his experiences of blackness in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly when David describes his earliest same-sex encounter with a man called Joey. In this description \\"black\\" becomes a motif for experience and his dark thoughts surrounding Joey and his body.  LGBTQ+ spaces and movement in the public sphere  Much of the integral plot of Giovanni's Room occurs within queer spaces, with the gay bar David frequents being the catalyst that not only drives the plot, but allows it to occur. The bar acts as a mediator for David, Baldwin uses this setting to bring up much of the conflict of the novel, however, it remains a place that David returns to. Baldwin's novel is one of the most accurate portrayals of LGBTQ+ people navigating the public and private sphere of its time. It negotiates the behaviour of publicly LGBTQ+ people alongside those who are still \\"closeted\\", like David, and how these differing perspectives have an effect on the individual as well as the community that they navigate.  Homosexuality/Bisexuality  Sexuality is the singular, major theme of Baldwin's novel. However, he layers this reading of sexuality by making David's internal conflict not only between homosexuality and heteronormativity but also, between homosexuality and bisexuality. This layered experience reinforces the notion that David's experience of sexuality are tied to his experience of gender norms. He struggles with the idea that he can be attracted to people of either gender because he sees it as proof of his fragile masculinity. In creating this manifestation, Baldwin fairly accurately describes the male bisexual experience of the time, the feeling of indecisiveness and insecurity. It is this portrayal of bisexuality and the experience of bi-erasure that make Baldwin's novel particularly unique. Question of bisexuality Ian Young argues that the novel portrays homosexual and bisexual life in western society as uncomfortable and uncertain, respectively. Young also points out that despite the novel's \\"tenderness and positive qualities\\" it still ends with a murder.Young, Ian, The Male Homosexual in Literature: A Bibliography, Metuchen, NJ: The Scarecrow Press, 1975, p. 155. Recent scholarship has focused on the more precise designation of bisexuality within the novel. Several scholars have claimed that the characters can be more accurately seen as bisexual, namely David and Giovanni. As Maiken Solli claims, though most people read the characters as gay/homosexual, \\". . . a bisexual perspective could be just as valuable and enlightening in understanding the book, as well as exposing the bisexual experience.\\"Solli, Maiken, \\"Reading Bisexually: Acknowledging a Bisexual Perspective in Giovanni's Room, The Color Purple and Brokeback Mountain. MA thesis. University of Oslo, 2012. Though the novel is considered a homosexual and bisexual novel, Baldwin has on occasion stated that it was \\"not so much about homosexuality, it is what happens if you are so afraid that you finally cannot love anybody\\". The novel's protagonist, David, seems incapable of deciding between Hella and Giovanni and expresses both hatred and love for the two, though he often questions if his feelings are authentic or superficial. Literary significance and criticism Even though Baldwin states that \\"the sexual question and the racial question have always been entwined\\", in Giovanni's Room, all of the characters are white. This was a surprise for his readers, since Baldwin was primarily known by his novel Go Tell It On The Mountain, which puts emphasis on the African-American experience.T√≥ib√≠n, Colm. \\"The Unsparing Confessions of 'Giovanni‚Äôs Room'\\", New Yorker. February 26, 2016. Highlighting the impossibility of tackling two major issues at once in America, Baldwin stated: > I certainly could not possibly have‚Äînot at that point in my life‚Äîhandled the > other great weight, the ‚ÄòNegro problem.‚Äô The sexual-moral light was a hard > thing to deal with. I could not handle both propositions in the same book. > There was no room for it. Nathan A. Scott Jr., for example, stated that Go Tell It On the Mountain showed Baldwin's \\"passionate identification\\" with his people whereas Giovanni's Room could be considered \\"as a deflection, as a kind of detour.\\"Scott, Nathan A., Jr. 1967. \\"Judgment Marked by a Cellar: The American Negro Writer and the Dialectic of Despair\\", Denver Quarterly 2(2):5‚Äì35. Baldwin's identity as a gay and black man was questioned by both black and white people. His masculinity was called into question, due to his apparent homosexual desire for white men - this caused him to be labelled as similar to a white woman. He was considered to be \\"not black enough\\" by his fellow race because of this, and labeled subversive by the Civil Rights Movement leaders. Baldwin's American publisher, Knopf, suggested that he \\"burn\\" the book because the theme of homosexuality would alienate him from his readership among black people.Eckman, Fern Marja, The Furious Passage of James Baldwin, New York: M. Evans & Co., 1966, p. 137. He was told, \\"You cannot afford to alienate that audience. This new book will ruin your career, because you‚Äôre not writing about the same things and in the same manner as you were before, and we won‚Äôt publish this book as a favor to you.\\" However, upon publication critics tended not to be so harsh thanks to Baldwin's standing as a writer.Levin, James, The Gay Novel in America, New York:Garland Publishing, 1991, p. 143. Giovanni's Room was ranked number 2 on a list of the best 100 gay and lesbian novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.The Publishing Triangle's list of the 100 best lesbian and gay novels On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Giovanni's Room on its list of the 100 most influential novels. The 2020 novel Swimming in the Dark by Tomasz Jedrowski presents a fictionalized depiction of LGBTQ life in the Polish People's Republic. Citing Giovanni's Room as a major influence in his writing, Jedrowski pays an homage to Baldwin by incorporating the novel into his narrative, the two main characters beginning an affair after one lends a copy of Giovanni's Room to the other.

Rock Macbeth or ) is a recurrent major character in most of Osamu Tezuka's manga series, and he is an important part of Osamu Tezuka's Star System. As all of Tezuka's main characters he is seen repeatedly in different works but differs as the character with the most various and changing roles from both hero and antihero. He is 17 years old. Appearance and Role Rock (sometimes spelled Roc) mainly appears as a young man with shiny dark hair and blue eyes. His appearance stays relatively the same, with hair that retains its style across works, but that often changes colour. He first appeared in the manga The Moony Man and later in the series Detective Boy Rock Holmes, as a child detective. (His name and traits where then based on Sherlock Holmes). Developing later into a more villainous character, his name changed into Rock Macbeth (Makube) as both his character and backstory where based on the famous antagonist of the Tragedy of Macbeth. He is later seen wearing dark sunglasses which, together with his ability to be a master of disguise, became one of his main trademarks. Appearing often as both a hero and antihero he is mainly portrayed as a strong, determined and charismatic leader whose both personality and beliefs stand as opposition to Tezuka's main protagonists Black Jack and Astro Boy. Already during his early roles as a good character his approach and ideas where more dark and harsh than the optimistic views of his friends Kenichi, Astro Boy and Black Jack. But in Tezuka's original works (such as Adventures of Rock and Phoenix) his solutions were also portrayed as the more realistic and effective ones, while Astro Boy's striving towards an idealistic approach could never give an ultimate solution to the main problem of all Tezuka's works: war between two races or types (mostly humans vs. robots, other creatures or ugly vs. the beautiful). Character development Rock appears as the most complex and round of all Tezuka's characters, undergoing major transformations and development through most of his works, while the other major other characters generally retained their original personalities and roles. While most of other Tezuka child characters (such as Kenichi) stayed the same age, Rock grew up throughout the years and his character was reused for more mature \\"roles\\" in Tezuka's manga, where he gradually developed a darker personality. Often cold and brutal, his character tends to be used as an antagonist, who later, in works such as Vampires, kidnapped and murdered people for the sake of achieving his goals. In this older form, Rock is often wearing a three-piece suit, a striped tie and dark sunglasses, the last of which became something of a trademark for him. Rock's dark persona appeared for the first time in the uncompleted Vampire manga, which was the first time Rock went by the name \\"Makube Rokuro\\", based on MacBeth for Makube and Kuro (\\"black\\" in Japanese) for Rokuro (mixed with \\"Rock\\"). He is often presented as a considerably more complex antagonist than many of Tezuka's other villains (who are usually bad people simply because that's what they've always been and always will be), and his actions are sometimes explained by a rough past (in the manga Nextworld, Metropolis and the newest Astro Boy series, for example). Rock often appears as either a heroic major or protagonist character, such as in Adventures of Rock and Princess Knight TV Series (as Prince Frank, Sapphire's love interest), or as an antagonist whose brutal means often have justified motives through the storyline (such as in Phoenix and other works). One of the very few instances in which he's been given a lighter and more comedic role was in 1985's Say Hello to Bookila, in which he was a hack writer investigating the truth behind a series of mysterious occurrences at a TV station. He is also the hero in the 1980 film Marine Express where he is again cast in a romantic lead with Sapphire, throughout which he is usually seen without his trademark sunglasses. Rock's role eventually developed from a sympathetic antihero to a notorious villain who will do almost anything for his personal causes (in Vampires and Alabaster). Through his evil role in the story Vampires he develops a further demonic nature in the manga Alabaster where he is seen as having no qualms about torturing, raping and killing to achieve his ends. Though in Alabaster his ambition develops to the point of narcissism he never becomes the most evil of Tezuka's characters (a role developed in the character of Yuki). His role gradually transferred from an orphaned boy with bitter experiences (Nextworld manga), to a passionate leader or agent of ruthless means who still acts upon some causes and values (Phoenix), a spoiled rich man's son (in most works Duke Red is his father) with villainous tendencies, to a royal figure (in Buddha and Princess Knight). Such was his role as King Bimbisara who retains Makube Rock's ambitious and self-preserving nature but also appears in a positive light as the only character wise and clearsighted enough to immediately recognise Siddhartha's greatness and grants him his name Buddha - The Enlightened One. In the adaptations after Tezuka's death Rock appears in works such as the 2001 Metropolis movie and the 2005 Black Jack: The Two Doctors of Darkness as a mixture of all of his roles. Setting off as an antagonist who ruthlessly strives to achieve his goal he is eventually pictured redeeming himself after dying for his fiancee Midori in Black Jack while he dies trying to save his father in Metropolis. This trait was never seen in Tezuka's works where he only repents and faces death bravely but never finds redemption by willingly sacrificing his life. Prominent roles and appearances Rock was most recently seen in the animated version of Tezuka's Metropolis (the manga for which he did not appear in) and in the recent Astro Boy series (as the secret identity of villain Deadcross). He also appeared in the 2005 Black Jack: Two Doctors of Darkness movie. A character named Rock (but of a different appearance and personality) also appeared in the 1980 animated Phoenix 2772. In addition, Rock's character (sans sunglasses) was used to portray the young King Bimbisara in Tezuka's sprawling Buddha. Rock has appeared in more than 60 different manga and animated works, in the live action Vampire TV series, and in the Astro Boy: Omega Factor video game. *\\"Rock Holmes\\" in Detective boy Rock Holmes - 1949 *\\"Rock\\" in Nextworld - 1951 *\\"Rock\\" in The Adventure of Rock - 1952 *\\"Rock\\" in X-Point on the South Pacific - 1953 *\\"Rovel\\" in Astro Boy /F√ºhrer ZZZ - 1954 *\\"Kenta\\" in Astro Boy /Duel on the Alps - 1956 *\\"Vassanio\\" in Merchant of Venice - 1959 *\\"Mamoru Hoshino\\" in Captain Ken - 1960 *\\"Rob\\" in Galaxy Boy Troop - 1963 (both as an animated character and a marionette) *\\"Makube Rock\\" in The Vampires - 1966-69 *\\"Prince Frank\\" in Princess Knight TV series - 1967-1968 *\\"Rock\\" in Phoenix \\"Future\\" - 1967 *\\"Rock Holmes\\" in Alabaster - 1970 *\\"King Bimbisara\\" in Buddha - 1972-1982 *\\"Akudo\\" in Black Jack: Where is a Doctor! - 1973 (son of Duke Red) *\\"Rock\\" in Black Jack/Finger - 1974 (sealed - rewritten as \\"Print Proof\\" 1978) *\\"Dr. Ohedo\\" in Black Jack /Nadare the Deer - 1974 *\\"Thomas Waterman\\" in The Story of Stone - 1975 *\\"Satoru\\" in The Story of Bis Bis Bis Planet - 1975 *\\"Baron Rockbelt\\" in Metamorphose /Woobbit - 1976 (appears as both human and werewolf) *\\"Rock\\" in Black Jack /The Last Train - 1978 (as the husband of the Black Queen) *\\"Rokku Homura\\" in Black Jack /Tenacious Black Jack - 1978 *\\"Makube Rock\\" in Black Jack /Print Proof - 1978 (Black Jack's childhood friend) *\\"Rock\\" in Undersea Super Train: Marine Express - 1979 anime *\\"Rock\\" in Fumoon - 1980 anime *\\"Rock\\" in Phoenix 2772 - 1980 anime *\\"Rock\\" in Metropolis - 2001 anime (but not in the original manga) *\\"Makube Rock\\" in Black Jack online Flash animation episode 9 - 2001/2 (retelling of Print Proof) *\\"Rock\\" in Astro Boy TV Series episodes 34 - 35 - 2003 anime *\\"Rock/Lord Deadcross\\" in Astro Boy GBA game \\"Omega Factor\\" - 2004 two different manifestations ‚Äì human and robot (President Rag) *\\"Akudo\\" in Black Jack \\"Four Miracles of Life\\" animated special 1 - 2004 *\\"Dr. Daigo Oeda\\" in Black Jack TV episode 24, \\"Nadare the Deer\\" - 2004-6 *\\"Rock\\" in Phoenix TV, episodes 12-13 - 2005 *\\"Rock\\" in Black Jack Movie \\"Two Dark Doctors\\" - 2005 *\\"Rock\\" in Black Jack: Phoenix Version game for Nintendo DS - 2006 *\\"Leader Ratoh/Ratom\\" in Ravex in Tezuka World - 2009 (appears as both a human and a robot fusion with Astro Boy) See also *List of Osamu Tezuka anime *List of Osamu Tezuka manga ReferencesExternal links *Rock Homes at TezukaOsamu@World Category:Fictional detectives Category:Osamu Tezuka characters Category:Male characters in anime and manga ","title":"Rock (manga)"},{"id":"1500131","text":"Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit is a novel by Jeanette Winterson published in 1985 by Pandora Press. It is a coming-of-age story about a lesbian girl who grows up in an English Pentecostal community. Key themes of the book include transition from youth to adulthood, complex family relationships, same-sex relationships, organised religion and the concept of faith. It has been included on both GCSE and A-Level reading lists for education in England and Wales, 68995-unit-f662-literature-post-1900-coursework-guidance and was adapted by Winterson into a BAFTA-winning 1990 BBC television drama serial of the same name. Background The book is semi-autobiographical and is based on Winterson's life growing up in Accrington, Lancashire. \\"I wrote about some of these things in Oranges, and when it was published, my mother sent me a furious note\\".Jeanette Winterson.'Why be Happy When You could be normal.' A parallel non-fictional account of her life at this time is given in her 2011 memoir, Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? Although the protagonist of Oranges bears the author's first name, John Mullan has argued that it is neither an autobiography nor a memoir, but a K√ºnstlerroman.'True stories', John Mullan, The Guardian, 27 October 2007. Premise The main character is a young girl named Jeanette, who is adopted by evangelists from the Elim Pentecostal Church. She believes she is destined to become a missionary. The book depicts religious enthusiasm as an exploration of the power of love. As an adolescent, Jeanette finds herself attracted to another girl, and her mother's group of religious friends subject her and her partner to exorcisms. Allusions to other works The novel is divided into eight sections, each of which are named after the first eight books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges and Ruth.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/20/jeanettewinterson As a result, each chapter often contains references and allusions to their corresponding book in the Bible. The novel also contains references to numerous other literary works, historical figures and aspects of popular culture: *Jeanette's mother frequently lauds the good and moral behaviour of the titular character in Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. *Jeanette compares her mother to William Blake. *Jeanette's great-uncle is described as a stage- actor, who at least once performed as Hamlet to favourable reviews. *The owner of the local pest-control shop, Mrs. Arkwright, shares the same name with the similarly miserly owner of the local grocery shop in Open All Hours, a popular BBC sitcom that originally ran from 1976-1985. *Jeanette's mother is subscribed to the religious magazine The Plain Truth, which was issued monthly by The Worldwide Church of God from 1934 to 1986. In the novel the family receive a weekly subscription. *Whilst visiting Jeanette in hospital, Elsie reads \\"Goblin Market\\" by Christina Rossetti, and poems by William Butler Yeats, including 'Lapis Lapuzi'. *Jeanette and her mother see The Ten Commandments, starring Charlton Heston, at the cinema. *For her Easter-Egg painting competition entry, Jeanette paints her eggs as characters from Wagner's opera-cycle The Ring of the Nibelung, including the Germanic heroine Brunhilda. *She also creates artworks based on the 1942 film Now, Voyager, and the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. *At her local library, Jeanette reads a version of the French fairy tale Beauty and the Beast. *Jeannette's mother is shown to be a fan of country and gospel singer Johnny Cash. *In her new oversized raincoat Jeannette is reminded of seeing The Man in the Iron Mask - although which film version remains unspecified. *Feelings of misery remind Jeanette of the poet John Keats. *The short, abstract section entitled 'Deuteronomy' alludes to The Legend of Atlantis, the mythical city of El Dorado, Saint George and the Second World War. *Later in the novel, a confused Jeanette dreams of a library where a number of young women are shown to be translating the epic Old-English poem Beowulf. *Toward the close of the novel, Jeanette is depicted on a train reading George Eliot's Middlemarch. The novel is also interspersed with short stories that bear many resemblances to (and draw influences from) traditional Biblical stories of the Old Testament, tales of Arthurian Legend (specifically related to Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) and other popular fairy-tales. Reception The novel won Winterson the Whitbread Award for a First Novel in 1985. Although it is sometimes referred to as a \\"lesbian novel\\", Winterson has objected to this label, arguing, \\"I've never understood why straight fiction is supposed to be for everyone, but anything with a gay character or that includes gay experience is only for queers\\". Adaptations A television adaptation of the book was made and aired by the BBC in 1990, starring Charlotte Coleman and Geraldine McEwan, which won the Prix Italia in 1991.Prix Italia, Winners 1949 - 2010, RAI The book was released on cassette by BBC Audiobooks in 1990, also read by Coleman.

This atoll is quite isolated, the nearest land being Fakahina, located 182 km to the southwest. Puka-Puka Atoll has an elliptical shape. Its length is 6 km and its maximum width 3.3 km. Its land area is about 5 km2. The lagoon is filled with silt and has become very small. The low coral islands are dry and sparsely populated.

Unlike the rest of the Tuamotus, the language of the islands, Pukapukan, is Marquesic. History Puka-Puka was the first of the Tuamotus sighted by the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on 21 January 1521, and charted as San Pablo because it was discovered on the day on which Paul of Tarsus is traditionally said to have become a Christian. Together with Flint Island (named Tiburones) they were named Islas Infortunadas (Unfortunate Islands in Spanish). Dutch explorers Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten arrived at Puka-Puka on April 10, 1616 during their Pacific journey. They called this atoll \\"Honden Eiland\\" (\\"Dog Island\\").

After beginning a career as a concert pianist as a child, Arnaud acted in musical comedies. She switched to non- musical comedy and drama around 1920 and was one of the players in the second of the Aldwych farces, A Cuckoo in the Nest, a hit in 1925. She also had dramatic roles and made films in the 1930s and 1940s, and continued to act into the 1950s. She occasionally performed as a pianist later in her career. The Yvonne Arnaud Theatre was named in her memory in Guildford, Surrey. Life and career Arnaud was the daughter of Charles Leon Arnaud and his wife Antoinette (n√©e Montegut). She was brought up in Paris and entered the Paris Conservatoire aged 9, studying piano under Alphonse Duvernoy and other teachers. In 1905, she won the conservatory's Premier Prix for piano. Beginning that year, aged 14, until 1911, she performed with leading orchestras throughout Europe and the US, under conductors such as √âdouard Colonne, Arthur Nikisch, Willem Mengelberg, Vasily Safonov, Gustav Mahler and Alexander Siloti.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom, ed.

She next played the leading role of Suzanne in the musical The Girl in the Taxi (1912), earning popularity with her vivacity and charming French accent.Gillan, Don. \\"Yvonne Arnaud\\", StageBeauty.net, accessed 4 June 2012 One reviewer wrote: \\"Arnaud is as clever as her ways are charming, and her voice is beautiful\\".\\"The Girl in the Taxi Produced at The Lyric Theatre, London\\", Lloyds Weekly News, London, 12 September 1908 This was followed by roles in more musical comedies, farces and operettas, including as Noisette in Mam'selle Tralala in 1914 (revived the following year as Oh! Be Careful), two revivals of \\"The Girl in the Taxi\\" (in 1913 and 1915), in Harry Grattan's Odds and Ends (1914), Excuse Me!

She also had a lead in Kissing Time (1919). The Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford is named in her honour After this, an operation damaged her vocal cords, and so she switched from musicals to plays, beginning with the role of Louise Allington in the farce Tons of Money, which ran for nearly two years at the Shaftesbury Theatre from 1922. Her success in this play led to her appearance in the second of the Aldwych farces as Marguerite in A Cuckoo in the Nest, by Ben Travers, which was a hit in 1925. Other comic roles included Mrs. Pepys in J.B. Fagan's And So to Bed (1926) and the title Role in Fagan's The Improper Duchess (1931). In 1927 she travelled to New York where she repeated the Mrs. Pepys on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre. She also appeared in British films, beginning with the role of Pauline in Desire, in 1920, opposite Dennis Neilson-Terry. In 1929‚Äì30, she played the role of Elma Melton in the stage version (both London and New York) and then the film version of Frederick Lonsdale's Canaries Sometimes Sing. She also appeared in some dramatic roles in the 1930s and 1940s, including some Shakespearean roles. Among these were several productions of Love for Love during the Second World War. Arnaud made more films during the 1930s and 1940s, including film versions of some of the successful plays in which she had starred.Archive: \\"Tom Walls (1883‚Äì1949)\\" , British Pictures.com, accessed 2 June 2012 Arnaud's likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi's, the New York City theatre district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library.The New York Public Library Inventory of Sardi's Caricatures She continued to act on stage well into the 1950s. In 1958 she appeared in the West End with Jack Hulbert in Ronald Millar's The Big Tickle. She still occasionally performed as a pianist later in her career, for example, with the Hall√© Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli in Manchester in 1948. She was also the soloist at the premiere of Franz Reizenstein's pastiche Concerto Popolare at the 1956 Hoffnung Festival (having been chosen after Eileen Joyce declined). Personal life  Yvonne Arnaud's memorial in the churchyard of St. Martha's on the Hill In 1920, Arnaud married the actor Hugh McLellan, son of C. M. S. McLellan. She was a president of the League Against Cruel Sports from 1948 to 1951. She was also godmother to the writer Oriel Malet, and was the subject of Malet's book Marraine: a portrait of my godmother (1961).Oriel Malet, Marraine: a portrait of my Godmother, (Heinemann, 1961) For many years she lived in Guildford, Surrey, where she died. Her ashes were scattered in St. Martha's churchyard on St. Martha's Hill just south-east of Guildford, and there is a memorial to her on the church grounds. In 1965 the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre was opened in the town.

It was released in Japan in January 2004, and in North America in August 2004. Gameplay After customizing a character's gender and name, the player helps the Maboo Tribe of the Amazing Island remove a possessing spirit known as the \\"Black Evil\\".http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/23/amazing-island Amazing Island is a minigame collection with an avatar creator. The player chooses either a boy or girl avatar, along with a monster companion. By completing courses, the player gains Vision Orbs, which drives off the Black Evil, restores portions of the Island, and earns them new abilities and items to customize their monster partner. Upon purging the whole Island of Evil, the villagers and the player hold a celebration. Any time the player visits the Hall of Life, they can customize an existing monster or create a new monster. Creating a new monster costs nothing and will grant the player an additional Chance Star to use during minigames. If players' creature loses all of its Chance Stars, their creature will go back to the start and return players back to the village. To create a new monster, the player is to choose a Frame which acts as a skeleton for various body types, such as a dragon or a giant. Then the player can draw limbs and body parts on their creature, and choose how thick or thin they are to be. New frames are gathered from completed Courses and more advanced drawing tools such as a Stamp or Resize are gained from Vision Orbs. Monsters can be further customized, once built. Patterns are textures that drawn on the body that can range from materials e.g. Glass, Rock, Lava; skins e.g. Dog, Cow, Parrot; or outfits e.g. Ninja, Santa, Cute Robot. Eyes, voices, and accessories such as clothing or weapons can be added. More component variations and tools can be gained from Vision Orbs. New monster components can be bought from Shops or found in silver chests from Courses and imported from Monster Cards. Finally the player names their monster and takes their photo, which is a card that links the monster to the human world from Amazing Island. Preset monsters are fully predesigned monsters that can be acquired by finding their monster cards in gold chests. The player cannot modify these monsters at all, but they do not take space on the Nintendo GameCube memory card. The player can also take a five-question personality quiz to have a monster randomly generated. Every aspect of a monster‚Äîframe, accessories, actual drawn body shape and thickness‚Äîaffects its stats: Speed, Mental, Power, Stamina, Weight, Element, and Class. Various events rely on different stats; for example, races will use Speed while fights rely on Power. Monsters in their element, such as a Fire monster in a Spin (lava) stage, will gain an advantage. The Class stat denotes the overall skill level of the monster. Multiplayer Amazing Island offers multiplayer options, where two to four players can compete on the Courses or link up in the Monster Cards minigame. In the main game, players can complete an entire Course or specific event. They also have the option to use multiple memory cards to import their own monsters and cross-reference high scores between save files. In Monster Cards, up to four Game Boy Advances can link up to battle each other. If arranged close together, all four screens form an entire battle view. The last survivor of a Monster Cards battle will be awarded a chest. Reception The game received mostly mixed reviews. IGN gave it a 6.7 \\"passable\\" rating.

It is located at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and 14th Street, underneath Union Square in Manhattan, and is served by the: *, , , , and trains at all times * and trains at all times except late nights *W train on weekdays *<6> train weekdays in the peak direction In 2016, over 34 million passengers entered this station, making it the fourth-busiest station in the system. The complex is located on the border of several neighborhoods with popular business, residential and nightlife destination spots, including the East Village to the southeast, Greenwich Village to the south and southwest, Chelsea to the northwest, and both the Flatiron District and Gramercy Park to the north and northeast. The station complex consists of three originally separate stations, which were combined on July 1, 1948. They now share a mezzanine, common entrance points, and unified signage. This complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  History  In the 1990s, this station underwent a major station renovation. On July 9, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $2,993,948. As part of the contract, the consultant investigated whether it was feasible to reconfigure the IRT passageway, to reframe the exit structure on the Lexington Avenue platforms to accommodate the relocation and widening of stairs, the construction of a new fan room, the removal of stairs on the Broadway Line platforms, the reframing of the existing structure, and the construction of a new staircase between the intermediate and IRT mezzanines. These were all deemed feasible, and in May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $984,998 was reached to allow the consultant to prepare the design for this work.

It opened on October 27, 1904. The uptown and downtown platforms are offset from each other and slightly curved. Gap-filling movable platforms on the downtown side are automatically operated via proximity sensors when trains arrive. The station's mezzanines are located over the platforms. The station has two abandoned local side platforms; the northbound platform is visible through windows, bordered with wide, bright red frames, which is part of a larger, station-wide art installation entitled Framing Union Square, by Mary Miss. From the north end of the downtown platform's mezzanine, the adjacent side platform can be seen through a hole in the plywood. The abandoned platform edges are also visible from the current platforms. 1991 accident On August 28, 1991, an accident just north of the station killed five riders and injured 215 others in one of the worst wrecks since a crash at Times Square‚Äì42nd Street on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line in 1928 that killed 16 people. The train operator, Robert Ray, was intoxicated and had been overshooting platforms during the entire run from Woodlawn in the Bronx. Just north of this station, his Utica Avenue-bound 4 train was to be shifted to the local track due to repair work on the express one. He was running at in a zone and took the switch so fast that only the first car made it through the crossover. The rest of the train derailed, leading to a massive pile-up. Cars 1435, 1436, 1437, 1439, and 1440 were essentially scrapped on the site, and the track infrastructure suffered heavy structural damage as a result. Service was disrupted for six days, with trains terminating at 59th Street for the duration, as the wreckage was removed. The entire infrastructure, including signals, switches, track, roadbed, cabling, and 23 support columns needed to be replaced. Ray was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released in April 2002 for good behavior. The derailment occurred at the entry to a former pocket track. Similar to 72nd Street on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, this station was built with extra tracks on the approach to the station. These were between the local and express tracks and were approximately long. The idea was to have a \\"stacking\\" track where a train could be held momentarily until the platform cleared for it to enter the station. The tracks here and at 72nd Street were rendered useless when train lengths grew beyond these tracks' capacity. When the damage from the 1991 wreck was repaired, the stacking track was removed. A similar track still exists between the northbound tracks south of the 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square station's northbound platform.

It is the southernmost station in Manhattan with a cross-platform interchange between all four Broadway services. A mosaic on the platform side walls is a depiction of \\"the junction of Broadway and ... Bowery Road, 1828,\\" as the area was once known. The mezzanine and crossover level has been reconstructed as well. Some former passageways and stairways have been closed off, including one immediately adjacent to the southernmost staircase on the northbound side. This station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The MTA replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with the 1970s wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. They also fixed staircases and platform edges. In 2002, the station was upgraded for ADA-accessibility and its original late 1910s tiling was restored. As part of the upgrade, the MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled for the walls and floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installed yellow safety treads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. The station now has an elevator on both platforms as well as connection to the station entrances and passageway to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. In 2005, an artwork called City Glow by Chiho Aoshima was installed here.

The station has two tracks and one island platform with numerous stairways and exits leading from it. There is one mezzanine attached to this station with entrances on the south side of 14th Street between Broadway and University Place. Other entrances in the complex serve the other services that stop here. The original mosaic band of sky blue, sea green, lime green and yellow ochre stands clearly visible above new green-bordered tile panels. The station has been renovated and is now ADA- accessible with a single elevator going up from the platform to the mezzanine. As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Program and the L Project, several modifications were implemented on the platform to improve circulation and to reduce crowding. The stairs from the Broadway Line platforms were rebuilt in March 2019; the stair from the downtown Broadway Line platform was reconfigured entirely. Additionally, a new escalator was installed from the east mezzanine to the platform; it cost around $15 million and opened on September 10, 2020.

It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei. Kamen Rider Hibiki first aired on January 30, 2005 and aired its final episode on January 22, 2006. Synopsis An 8 Hours of Suzuka Honda Bike with Kamen Rider Hibiki sponsorship The Kamen Riders, known as Oni, battle man-eating beasts called Makamou with \\"pure sound\\". One of the Oni, a man named Hibiki, ends up having a \\"teacher-and-apprentice\\"-like relationship with Asumu Adachi, a young boy unsure of himself and is at a crossroads in his life as he transitions to high school. Asumu learns to be an adult through watching Hibiki and the other Oni as they all train together to hone their skills in fighting the Makamou and the homunculi aiding them. However, the sudden rise of Makamou numbers proves to be a prelude to an upcoming calamity. Staff changes Kamen Rider Hibiki began with Shigenori Takatera as the Toei producer, however, Shinichiro Shirakura, who though having participated in other Heisei Kamen Rider series, had no involvement whatsoever in the Hibiki production, was appointed producer of the film Kamen Rider Hibiki & the Seven Senki, eventually replacing Takatera in the TV production from episode 30. The writing staff also changed; Tsuyoshi Kida and Shinji ≈åishi were replaced by Toshiki Inoue and Sh≈çji Yonemura, who had worked with Shirakura on Sh15uya and other Heisei Kamen Rider series. In addition, personalities such as Sensha Yoshida, a renowned manga artist; Hiroshi Yamamoto, a video game designer; Masao Higashi, a seasoned television and movie critic; and many others published severe criticisms in their personal blogs because of this. Even the show's star, Shigeki Hosokawa, who portrayed Hibiki, stated in his personal website that Inoue's scripts \\"needed adjustments\\" and that this whole staff change was \\"fraudulent\\". With the first production staff, Hosokawa would join the writers' meetings and give suggestions, however Hosokawa could not give his opinion in the second production staff meetings due to time restraints. In an interview published on TV Asahi's main website, Hosokawa stated that the script for the final episode was rewritten on the final day of filming. He later said that the script was sent in so late that it arrived on set as the final battle was being filmed. This finale was scrapped and then a new ending that, according to Hosokawa, was nothing like the intended ending, was filmed. Later in the interview, Hosokawa said that the Oni suit used by Kyosuke was a kitbash of two new suits made especially for the characters of Asumu and Kyosuke. Hosokawa said that this was the most upsetting change to him as the final script had been rewritten six times at that point and all but the filmed version contained both Asumu and Kyosuke becoming Oni. In January 2006, at the Kamen Rider Super Live, Hosokawa stated that the series was \\"essentially an incomplete process\\" and that \\"it should not have ended that way\\". Mitsu Murata, who portrayed the Douji characters, declared on his blog: \\"I cannot forgive them, I want to continue his idea\\", complaining about the removal of Takatera as producer. These declarations caused an unprecedented storm within the professional tokusatsu market and many of Toei's executives were berated for allowing a series to be handled in such a manner. There has never been any official statement from Toei, but many critics point out several facts might have caused it, the main reason being the low toy sales. It is not usual for a Toei production to have two different producers for the TV series and the movie. It is likely that a different producer was appointed for the movie because Toei was suffering from schedule problems with Takatera. Changes *Asumu's opening narration at the start of every episode was removed starting with episode 30. *A new opening was introduced in episode 34 and following. *The use of kanji being flashed on screen during scenes was removed altogether by episode 30. *The ending sequence was removed altogether. *The characters of Kyosuke Kiriya and Shuki were introduced to the series. *Originally Eiki and Shouki were both supposed to be the main cast members, but had their parts completely removed. *The fire-breathing (Onibi) and the clawed Oni (Onizume) abilities' sequences were completely removed along with Ibuki opening his mouth for his attack. The Makamou that opened their mouths too wide or spurted liquids were also removed. There had been complaints about these sequences from parent advocacy groups who claimed that they scared children. *Things as complicated-to-animate CG Makamou and shooting in mountains were almost entirely reduced probably due to cost issues, leading critics to believe that Takatera was forcefully removed from the project due to his unwillingness to change his script to adapt to these changes. Characters=Takeshi is a secret organization based in Yoshino, Nara, having been established two centuries ago as a partnership between the Oni and a select group of humans to defend Japan from the Makamou. In the present day, Takeshi has offices across Japan composed of Oni and a backup team that provided intelligence and support. The combatant agents of Takeshi are known as Oni, who have long protected humans from the Makamou for centuries. The title of every Oni bears the -ki suffix (È¨º), which is semantically identical to \\"Oni\\" in Japanese language. It also has some resemblance with the real name of the Oni. ; : Real name , Hibiki is among the most seasoned Oni with a strong sense of ethics and believes in constantly training oneself to keep up with their strength while being somewhat of a mentor figure. He takes Asumu under his wing, helping in anyway that includes giving him needed advice. Using the , he transforms into and use his drumsticks as bludgeoning weapons. He later acquires the ability to become from his summoning training, and then with a modified ancient weapon known as the . ; : Real name , he is a composed member of an Oni family that oversee Takeshi's Yoshino headquarters and takes that position of protecting others and taking extremely dangerous missions with pride. But Ibuki gradually begins fearing death while realizing he was not as strong as he assumed himself to be, though he musters the courage to help Hibiki during the Orochi event. Using the , he can transform into and use his trumpet gun as a weapon. ; : Ibuki's apprentice, who wanted to become an Oni out of revenge after her parents were killed by Makamou. While able to become an Oni, she eventually gives up her goal of being an Oni following her time with Shuki and resumes a normal life. ; : Real name , he was originally an apprentice to Zanki who resolved to make a name for himself as the present-day rather than inherit his master's title. To transform, Todoroki uses the bracelet. After becoming an official Oni, Todoroki is given his mentor's guitar for his own. ; : Real name , he is among the most seasoned of the Oni with Todoroki as his apprentice. Using the bracelet, he can transform into and uses his guitar as his weapon. Due to an injury he suffered from mentor Shuki during his days as her apprentice, Zanki resolves to serve as Todoroki's support while his apprentice takes over his duties as an Oni. While he ended up dead when forced to transform again, he uses a forbidden spell Shuki taught him to remain among the living until Todoroki is able to stand on his own two feet. ; : The current head official of Takeshi's Kant≈ç branch and father of the Tachibana sisters, a cheerful man who gives the Oni under him thoughtful advice while sending them out on their missions while having a personal library where he researches the Makamou. ;: : The eldest Tachibana sister, a very intelligent individual who usually acts aa a field support by providing the Oni supplies and extra Disc Animals. ;: : The youngest Tachibana sister, a cheerful girl who usually hangs around Takeshi Headquarters to track the Makamou and rarely goes out into the field. ; : Takeshi's equipment and weapons designer. She is responsible for creating the sound weapons for the Oni and the Disc Animals. She is an old friend of Hitoshi, who has been friends since childhood and joined Takeshi to aid him once he became the current Hibiki. ; : The head of Takeshi's weapon design section and Midori's mentor, a former Oni who is said to have defeated twenty Makamou single-handedly. He is also a singer in his spare time. Much of Takeshi, including Ichiro, fears him because of his strict disciplinary personality (with the exception of a few people). When he is angered, he chases his \\"victim\\" and hits them with a paddle. He also travels using a motorcycle with the newly improved Armed Saber which he made and was almost too powerful for any Oni to control, causing them to lose their transformation abilities for a month. When Torodoki and Hibiki were affected by the Armed Saber, Konosuke trained the two with his special training to improve their powers. The training, utilizing energy from the gut while singing, paid off for Hibiki because it enabled him to wield the Armed Saber. After that, Konosuke left for Yoshino. Others ; : A high school student who Hibiki took under his wing for advice and decides to become his apprentice before resolving to live a normal life and support Hibiki instead. ; : Asumu's classmate and Todoroki's cousin. ; : A high school student who becomes Asumu's rival after becoming an apprentice to Hibiki. After Asumu stepped down from becoming an Oni, Kyosuke became both Hibiki's only apprentice and a full- fledged Oni a year after the events of Orochi. ; : Asumu's mother who works as a taxi driver. ; : Real name unknown, Shuki is a former Oni with a knowledge of Oni lore who uses ancient Oni techniques that include the Firebird shikigami and means to appear in her early 30s. Unlike the other Oni who fight the Makamou to protect humans, Shuki's motivation was to track down and kill the Makamou Notsugo after it slaughtered her family years ago. Because of her personal vendetta, and inflicting her former apprentice Zanki with a crippling injury when her chance to kill Notsugo presented itself, Shuki was stripped of her Oni title as she was being gradually consumed by her Oni power. Shuki resurfaced years later in a suit of before stealing Todoroki's Onjo to resume her form as , taking Akira as her apprentice due to their similarities. Shuki succeeds in exacting her revenge on Natsugo by sacrificing herself so Zanki can kill it, and Shuki requesting Zanki to bury her under flowers to conceal her true face. : Among making many changes to the Kamen Rider look, Kamen Rider Hibiki introduced Kamen Rider Shuki, the third officially recognized female Heisei Kamen Rider in a Kamen Rider series after Kamen Rider Femme from Kamen Rider Ryuki and Kamen Rider Larc from Kamen Rider Blade. Douji and Hime The term used for a pair of homunculi servants that aid a Makamou, revealed to be clones created by a couple known as the , who are the antagonists of most of the series despite preferring to act from behind the scenes. It is assumed they were humans who achieved a means of immortality long ago and have been modifying the Makamou to wipe out the Oni and destroy humanity. The are the clones of the Man while the are clones of the Woman, the Parent clones who care for the Makamou having swapped voices and the ability to transform into humanoid versions of their \\"children\\". The Parents are created by clones, the ones in black trench coats creating the Giant-Type Makamou Parents with the black Kugutsu Hime providing them with armor modification, while the ones in white robes create the Summer-Type Makamou Parents. The Kugutsu were executed by Super Douji and Super Hime. Eventually, the Man and Woman are forced into a ceasefire with the Oni as the Makamou were becoming too uncontrollable during the Orochi Phenomenon. A year after the Orochi Phenomenon was stopped, they created the Makamou Satori to abduct an ideal human (Hitomi) so they can use her to create more stable clones. At the end of the series, they are revealed to be the clones of the , who still need them to carry on their work. ; and : The \\"perfected\\" version of the Douji and Hime clones that replace the obsolete clones in supporting Makamou, originally childish in personality before they \\"matured\\" into homicidal psychopaths wanting to taste Oni blood. But they need to eat a special \\"armor orb\\" at a regular basis to prolong their lives. During the Orochi Phenomenon, the clones started to develop a sense of self as they begin, with Super Hime starting to question their existence and their creators' intent, to Super Douji's annoyance. After being told to protect the Oni, they attempted a rebellion against their creators' will which resulted in them dying from losing the method that prolonged their short lives. Makamou The regular antagonists of the series; the are an assortment of monstrous creatures that usually dwell in the rural areas and consume human beings as food. Chimerical in appearance with their size and shape depending on the environment they are born in, and serving as the basis of the y≈çkai myths, the Makamo are a naturally created phenomena though some have been modified by the Man and Woman to be stronger and unpredictable. But the Makamou can destabilize and explode when exposed to pure sound produced by the Oni's attacks. In the final arc, a chain of events called the occurs. Marked by the appearance of Kodama's Forest, every known Makamou appears at the same time, increasing in massive numbers to the point where not even the Man and Woman can control them.

It is shaped roughly like a Greek final sigma (œÇ), with a well-protected central bay, surrounded by a ring of relatively high mountains. The whole island appears very much to be the peak of a sinking volcano, with the bay as the caldera. The area of the main island is 38.5 km2. Little Rapa Tauturau is an offshore island. Its main town, Ahur√©i (or Ha'ur√©i), lies on the southern shore of that bay, which is called the Baie d'Ahur√©i. A smaller village, 'Area, is located on the northern shore of the bay.

Although sometimes considered part of the Austral Islands, Rapa Iti and the Bass Islands have a different geological, linguistic and cultural history.F. Allan Hanson, Rapan Lifeways (1970) History Rapa Iti was first settled by Polynesians, most likely in the 13th century. Their Polynesian dialect developed into what is today the Rapa language over the centuries.CDNN It is believed that the depletion of natural resources on the island resulted in warfare, and the inhabitants lived in up to 14 fortified settlements (\\"pa\\" or \\"pare\\", a type of fort) on peaks and clifftops. It is considered that the oldest of these is Morongo Uta, which was developed . The first European to visit Rapa Iti was George Vancouver on 22 December 1791; he named the island Oparo. Contact with Europeans brought liquor and disease, and between 1824 and 1830 over three quarters of the natives died. Peruvian slavers raided the island as well. When a handful of their victims were returned to the island, they brought with them smallpox, which caused an epidemic. In 1826, there were almost 2000 inhabitants; forty years later, there were fewer than 120. The independent island kingdom was declared a French protectorate in 1867. The British established a coaling station on the island, which prompted France to formally annex it on 6 March 1881. Subsequently, the native monarchy was abolished and the last queen, the daughter or Parima, was deposed on 18 June 1887. Thor Heyerdahl, notably, made excavations in Morongo Uta, seeking links between Rapa Iti and Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Climate As Rapa is well south of the Tropic of Capricorn, it doesn't have a tropical climate. Rather, its climate is closer to the oceanic and humid subtropical classifications. The island is devoid of coconuts due to the cool temperatures in winter, during which time, the temperature can drop below 9 ¬∞C (48 ¬∞F) at night. The summer is very mild but seldom very hot. Overall, Rapa is very windy, characteristic of the oceanic and subtropical influence. It receives about 2,500 mm of annual rainfall. Environment The Manatau French Polynesian Reserve is a special French Polynesian Reserve to protect the animals and ridgetop forts of an area of southern Rapa. It is located near South Ahur√©i. The island is home to the endemic and vulnerable Rapa fruit dove which is threatened by habitat loss, predation by feral cats and hunting. Its population was estimated in 1989‚Äì90 at 274 individual birds. Other birds include the near threatened Murphy's petrel, the endangered Newell's shearwater, both of which nest there in small numbers, and the vulnerable bristle-thighed curlew which is a non-breeding visitor while migrating. Because of its significance for these species the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. Administration The commune of Rapa consists of the island of Rapa Iti and the four uninhabited Marotiri rocks.

Plants grow on trees or rocks in habitats that are generally shady with high humidity, and can be quite different in appearance from their desert-dwelling cousins. Most species of Schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf-like pads joined one to the other and flowers which appear from areoles at the joints and tips of the stems. Two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti. Recent phylogenetic studies using DNA have led to three species of the related genus Hatiora being transferred into Schlumbergera, though this change is not universally accepted. Common names for these cacti generally refer to their flowering season. In the Northern Hemisphere, they are called Christmas cactus, Thanksgiving cactus, crab cactus and holiday cactus. In Brazil, the genus is referred to as (May flower), reflecting the period in which they flower in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the popular houseplants are cultivars of Schlumbergera, rather than species, with flowers in white, pink, yellow, orange, red or purple. The Easter cactus or Whitsun cactus, until recently placed in the genus Hatiora, is also called a holiday cactus and has flowers in red, orange, pink and white. The cultivars of the Christmas cactus fall into two main groups: * The Truncata Group contains all cultivars with features derived mainly from the species S. truncata: stem segments with pointed teeth; flowers held more or less horizontally, usually above the horizontal, whose upper side is differently shaped from the lower side (zygomorphic); and pollen which is yellow. They generally flower earlier than members of the Buckleyi Group and, although common names are not applied consistently, may be distinguished as Thanksgiving cactus, crab cactus or claw cactus. * The Buckleyi Group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth; more or less symmetrical (regular) flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. They generally flower later than members of the Truncata Group and are more likely to be called Christmas cactus. Description alt=Flower cut in half vertically with the base to the left; the bases of the tepals form a kind of tube, the upper parts bending away from the tube; the stamens run the full length of the flower from left to right and emerge from the end; some start at the very base of the flower, others start from further along to the right, being joined to a tepal. In the wild, the species of Schlumbergera grow either on trees (epiphytic) or on rocks (epilithic) and can form sizeable shrubs with woody bases; a height of up to has been reported for one species (S. opuntioides). They are leafless, the green stems acting as photosynthetic organs. The stems are composed of segments, which take one of two forms. In most species the segments are strongly flattened (cladodes), being made up of a central core with two (or more rarely three) \\"wings\\". Special structures characteristic of cacti, called \\"areoles\\", then occur at the ends of the segments of the stem. In two species the stems are less flattened, more cylinder-shaped, and the areoles are arranged in a more or less spiral pattern all over the segments. In both cases, the areoles, which may have wool and bristles, are where the flower buds appear., particularly pp. 18‚Äì19 The flowers either hang downwards and are almost regular (radially symmetrical or actinomorphic) or, as in most species, are held more or less horizontally with the higher side of the flower different from the lower side (radially asymmetrical or zygomorphic). In those species whose flowers are held up, their angle with the horizontal is relatively constant and is characteristic of the species. Each flower has 20‚Äì30 tepals. The outer tepals ‚Äì those closer to the base of the flower ‚Äì are short and unconnected, and spread out or curve backwards. The inner tepals ‚Äì those towards the tip of the flower ‚Äì are longer and in most species become progressively more fused together at the base to form a floral tube. In some species the difference between the outer and inner tepals creates the appearance of a \\"flower within a flower\\". The flowers produce nectar in a chamber at the base of the floral tube. In most species, the many stamens are arranged in two series, with the inner stamens being fused at the base to form a short tubular structure and the outer stamens arising from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6‚Äì8 lobes; the style plus stigma is roughly the same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1 mm in diameter. Taxonomy Drawing of S. russelliana, the alt=Drawing is probably of a pressed specimen as it appears flat; the base is at the bottom and the plant then branches repeatedly ‚Äì about six times in the longest branch. Most branches end in either buds or regular flowers which are pinkish. The genus is one of a small number belonging to a group of cacti classified as the tribe Rhipsalideae. Species of cacti belonging to this group are quite distinct in appearance and habit from most other cacti since they grow on trees or rocks as epiphytes or lithophytes. Although the species are easy to identify as members of the Rhipsalideae, for many years there was confusion as to how they should be divided into genera. This confusion extended to Schlumbergera, whose complicated taxonomic history has been detailed by McMillan and Horobin. The modern genus Schlumbergera was created by Charles Lemaire in 1858. The name commemorates Fr√©d√©ric Schlumberger, who had a collection of cacti at his chateau near Rouen. Lemaire placed only one species in his new genus ‚Äì a plant discovered in Brazil in 1837 which had been named Epiphyllum russellianum by William J. Hooker. Lemaire renamed it Schlumbergera epiphylloides (under the current rules of botanical nomenclature it should have been called Schlumbergera russelliana, which is its current name). Lemaire noted the similarity of his Schlumbergera epiphylloides to a species first described as Epiphyllum truncatum by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1819, but did not accept that the two species should be included in the same genus. In 1890, Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus, transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus. Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum, abandoning Zygocactus, the generic name Zygocactus continued to be widely used. In 1913, Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Rose followed Lemaire in keeping Schlumbergera russelliana and Zygocactus truncatus in separate genera. They also transferred the Easter cactus to Schlumbergera as S. gaertneri, initiating a lasting confusion between these two genera. In 1953, Reid Venable Moran placed both Schlumbergera russelliana and Zygocactus truncatus in the genus Schlumbergera. Other species were added later by David Hunt, including those formerly placed in Epiphyllanthus, to form the modern total of six full species and a number of hybrids. Schlumbergera and Hatiora have long been confused. Species in the former genus generally have flowers that are zygomorphic with a distinct floral tube, while those in the latter have actinomorphic flowers with inconspicuous tubes. DNA data shows that as previously circumscribed the two genera are not monophyletic and the three species in Hatiora subgenus Rhipsalidopsis have been transferred into Schlumbergera, although this change has not been universally adopted. Synonymy The following genera are now synonyms of Schlumbergera (i.e. they have no species not moved into Schlumbergera): * Epiphyllanthus A.Berger * Opuntiopsis Knebel (nom. inval.) * Zygocactus K.Schum. * Zygocereus Friƒç & Kreuz. (orth. var.) * Epiphyllum Pfeiff. but not Epiphyllum Haw. The case of Epiphyllum is complex. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the genus Cactus. As more species were discovered this proved too broad, and new genera were set up to subdivide the cacti. The genus Epiphyllum was created in 1812 by Haworth, based on Linnaeus's Cactus phyllanthus. In 1831 Johann Link created the genus Phyllocactus based on the same species. Following Ludwig Pfeiffer in 1837, the European tradition was to use Phyllocactus for epiphytic cacti with large regular flowers and Epiphyllum for the irregular-flowered species now called Schlumbergera truncata. Under modern rules, Phyllocactus is an illegitimate name, as is Epiphyllum in the sense of Pfeiffer; thus Epiphyllum Pfeiff. is a synonym of Schlumbergera. The true genus Epiphyllum Haw. now has around 19 species. Species Between six and nine species are currently recognized. In the narrowest circumscription, Schlumbergera sensu stricto, six species are accepted. Only synonyms which have been widely used (and their basionyms) are given in the list below. * Schlumbergera kautskyi (Horobin & McMillan) N.P.Taylor : syn.

The International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants recommends that cultivated plants should be named under its rules, not those appropriate for natural species and hybrids. The Group names given below were provided by McMillan and Horobin. * Schlumbergera √ó buckleyi (T.Moore) Tjaden = S. russelliana √ó S. truncata; S. Buckleyi Group *: syn.

A strip running roughly south-west to north- east along part of this coastline is coloured red. The red strip is about five times as long as wide and extends either side of Rio de Janeiro. Schlumbergera occurs only in the coastal mountains of south-east Brazil, in the states of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo. Sites where it has been found range from close to the Tropic of Capricorn northwards to 20¬∞S, i.e. in the southernmost part of the tropics. Plants grow at altitudes from in the case of S. truncata to in the case of S. microsphaerica, either in the coastal moist forests or in rocky areas. The natural distribution of Schlumbergera species has become confused because European cultivars were deliberately introduced into some areas, including the Serra dos √ìrg√£os National Park, by the Brazilian Agricultural Department, to compensate for over-collecting of wild plants. Because of their height and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the coastal mountains produce high altitude moist forests ‚Äì warm moist air is forced upwards into higher, colder locations where it condenses. Schlumbergera species grow in habitats which are generally relatively cool, shaded and of high humidity. David Hunt describes collecting specimens in conditions of cloud, drizzle and overnight temperatures down to . Plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on moss-covered tree branches or in rock crevices, often in small pockets of substrate formed from decayed leaves and other vegetation. S. microsphaerica is found at higher altitudes, above , in barren rocky habitats, and tolerates higher light levels. The flowers of Schlumbergera have adaptations for pollination by hummingbirds: tubular flowers with abundant nectar, and colours towards the red end of the spectrum. Most species require cross-pollination to set seed. The exceptions are S. kautskyi and S. microsphaerica; as noted above, the latter is found at higher altitudes where hummingbirds may be absent or less common. The fruits of Schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe, and appear to be adapted for distribution by birds, which eat the seeds and pulp contained in the fruit. Birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on tree branches, where the seeds might be able to germinate. Segments may also break off from the stems and take root, thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively. Cultivation of Christmas cacti=History alt=A small portion of green stem is to the left. A yellow flower seen from the side extends to the right. Stamens and a style extend out of the flower. Running from left to right the flower tilts upwards. At the end of the flower the upper petals are only bent back a short way, whereas the lower petals are bent almost back on themselves. Schlumbergera truncata was in cultivation in Europe by 1818, and S. russelliana was introduced in 1839. The two species were deliberately crossed in England by W. Buckley resulting in the hybrid now called S. √ó buckleyi, first recorded in 1852. By the 1860s, a substantial number of cultivars (cultivated varieties) were available in a range of colours and habits, and were used as ornamental plants in \\"stoves\\" (heated greenhouses) and in houses, where they were popular for their autumn and winter flowering. Many cultivars were selected seedlings of S. truncata, but at least three S. √ó buckleyi hybrids were available, of which one, now called S. 'Buckleyi', is thought to be the original Christmas cactus. By the early part of the 20th century, the genus had become less popular, and many of the early cultivars were lost., particularly pp. 56‚Äì63 From around the 1950s onwards, breeding resumed in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. New plants were produced by crossing among the species and existing cultivars of S. truncata, S. russelliana and the hybrid S. √ó buckleyi. Treatments which induced mutations were also used. The result was a wide range of flower colours which had not been available before, including the first true yellow to be sold commercially, S. 'Gold Charm' (which was a sterile triploid). Breeders aimed for plants which grew strongly, were upright at the point of sale rather than pendulous, had many flowers or buds, and were adapted to living as house plants. In the 1980s the species S. orssichiana was also used in crosses. The hybrid of S. truncata and S. orssichiana has been named S. √ó reginae or S. Reginae Group; one of the first cultivars was S. 'Bristol Queen'. S. opuntioides crosses have also been made, but have not resulted in commercially available cultivars. Modern cultivars alt=The picture shows a flower from more or less below. The tepals radiate outwards from the centre, more or less symmetrically. The petals nearest the viewer bend outwards less than those further away. McMillan and Horobin have listed hundreds of modern European, North American and Australian cultivars of the Christmas cactus, which they put into a number of cultivar groups: * The Truncata Group contains all cultivars with mainly S. truncata characteristics: stem segments with pointed teeth (dentate); zygomorphic flowers held more or less horizontally, usually above the horizontal; and pollen which is yellow. * The Buckleyi Group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth (crenate); more regular flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. There is considerable variation within this Group; McMillan and Horobin introduced subcategories: \\"TB\\" for those more like S. truncata and \\"BT\\" for those more like the classic S. √ó buckleyi, with \\"B\\" reserved for the first generation (F1) S. √ó buckleyi hybrids. * The Reginae Group contains cultivars known to be derived from hybrids with S. orssichiana. * The Exotica Group is used for the small number of hybrids involving S. opuntioides. Attempts have also been made to classify cultivars by colour. A difficulty is that the flowers of many cultivars exhibit different colours depending on the temperature during bud formation and growth. In particular, temperatures below produce pink tones in otherwise white and yellow cultivars, and deepen the colour in pink and red cultivars. The availability of iron to the plant has also been suggested to affect flower colour. In the United States, cultivars are propagated in large numbers for sale before Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in November). In Europe, plants are mainly sold later in the year, in the period before Christmas. A single Dutch grower (de Vries of Aalsmeer, the Netherlands) was reported in 1989 as producing 2,000,000 plants per year. Common names Plants are offered for sale under a variety of common names. The earliest English common name was \\"Christmas cactus\\". In Europe, where plants are largely produced for sale in the period before Christmas, this remains the most widely used common name in many languages for cultivars of all groups (e.g. in German, in French, and in Spanish). This is also the name used in Canada. In the United States, where plants are produced for the Thanksgiving holiday in November, the name \\"Thanksgiving cactus\\" is used; \\"Christmas cactus\\" may then be restricted to cultivars of the Buckleyi Group, particularly the very old cultivars such as 'Buckleyi'. The name \\"crab cactus\\" (referring to the clawed ends of the stems) is also used for the Truncata Group. \\"Link cactus\\" is another common name, describing the way that the stems of the genus as a whole are made up of linked segments. The name \\"chain cactus\\" is common in New Zealand, and may also refer to Hatiora species. The Easter cactus or Whitsun cactus is now placed in the genus Hatiora, but was at one time included in Schlumbergera (or one of its synonyms). The name \\"holiday cactus\\" has been used to include both Schlumbergera and Hatiora cultivars. Care of cultivars When grown as house plants, Schlumbergera cultivars are said to be relatively easy to care for. McMillan and Horobin describe in detail their cultivation in both commercial and domestic conditions. Their specific recommendations include: * Growing medium: Free-draining, humus-rich, somewhat acid growing media are used for commercial production, such as a mixture of peat or leafmould and an inert material such as grit, sharp sand or polystyrene beads. It is recommended that plants should be grown in relatively small pots; half-height pots are suitable. * Watering: They are more tolerant of drought than many house plants, but can be damaged by both under- and over-watering. Keeping the growing medium just moist throughout the year avoids either extreme. * Light: They can be damaged by exposure to more than small amounts of sunlight. Members of the Buckleyi Group, such as the old-fashioned Christmas cactus with pendant flowers, are more tolerant of high light levels than members of the Truncata Group, such as most of the modern cultivars. Too much light causes stems to take on a reddish colouration; however, very low light levels will prevent flowering. Day length is important in controlling flowering; continuous darkness for at least 12 hours is necessary to induce bud formation. A period of about 8 days with 16 hours of darkness at has been shown to cause flower buds to form. Lower temperatures slow this process. The advice sometimes given to withhold water to produce flower buds has been shown to be incorrect. * Propagation: Both commercially and in the home, propagation can be achieved by using short pieces of stem, one to three segments long, twisted off rather than cut. Cuttings are allowed to dry for 1‚Äì7 days, forming a callus at the broken end, and then rooted in an open growing medium. Temperatures above and up to in long day/short night conditions speed rooting. File:Schlumbergera IP.jpgalt=A plant with green upright stems is growing in a blue pot.

The upper view shows bright red new cladodes forming, the centre shows maturing growth, the lower view shows two aerial roots extending down Pests and diseases In cultivation, these plants have been described as \\"remarkably free from pests and diseases\\". Two significant insect pests are aphids on young shoots, buds and flowers, and root mealybugs which attack below soil level. Stems and roots can be rotted by diseases caused by fungi and similar organisms; these include infections by species of Fusarium (a fungus), and Phytophthora and Pythium (both water moulds). Approved chemical treatments can be used in the case of insect attack or these diseases. Aphids, mealybugs and other invertebrate pests can spread viruses. Symptoms vary with the species, but a loss of vigour is usual. Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata. There is no treatment for virus diseases; it is recommended that infected plants be destroyed.

Common names include gnemon, melinjo, belinjo, kuliat/culiat, bago, bigo and padi oats or paddy oats.  Description  Gnetum gnemon It is a small to medium-size tree (unlike most other Gnetum species, which are lianas), growing to 15‚Äì20 m tall. The leaves are evergreen, opposite, 8‚Äì20 cm long and 3‚Äì10 cm broad, entire, emerging bronze-coloured, maturing glossy dark green. The fruit-like female strobilus consist of little but skin and a large nut-like seed 2‚Äì4 cm long inside. Male strobili are small, arranged in long stalks, and are often mistaken for flowers. Fleshy strobili weigh about 5.5 g, the seed alone 3.8 g. Strobili mature mainly from June to September in NE Philippines. The red (ripe) strobili are eaten by birds, mammals and reptiles.  Uses  Emping melinjo chips, made from smashed Gnetum gnemon seed Melinjo is native to Indonesia and widely used in Indonesian cuisine. The seeds are used for sayur asem (sour vegetable soup) and also, made into raw chips that later need to be deep-fried as crackers (emping, a type of krupuk). The crackers have a slightly bitter taste and are frequently served as a snack or accompaniment to Indonesian dishes. The leaves are also commonly used for vegetable dishes in Indonesia and southern Thailand. This plant is commonly cultivated throughout the Aceh region and is regarded as a vegetable of high status. Its male strobili, young leaves and female strobilus are used as ingredients in traditional vegetable curry called kuah pliek. This dish is served on all important traditional occasions, such as khanduri and keureudja. In the Pidie district, the women pick the red-skinned ripe fruit and make keureupuk muling from it. In Java, the young leaves and unpeeled seeds are used for ingredients in a dish called sayur asem.  Phytochemicals  Dimer Resveratrol Structure Recently, it has been discovered that melinjo strobili are rich in a stilbenoid composed of resveratrol and identified as a dimer. This result was published in XXIII International Conference on Polyphenols, Canada, in 2006.http://umanitoba.ca/polyphenols_conference/misc/topic4.pdf Melinjo resveratrol, having antibacterial and antioxidative activity,Hisada, H., et al.

This species may have applications in food industries which do not use any synthetic chemicals in their processes. Four new stilbene oligomers, gnemonol G, H, I and J, were isolated from acetone extract of the root of Gnetum gnemon along with five known stilbenoids, ampelopsin E, cis-ampelopsin E, gnetin C, D and E. The extraction of dried leaf of Gnetum gnemon with acetone water (1:1) gave C-glycosylflavones (isovitexin, vicenin II, isoswertisin, swertisin, swertiajaponin, isoswertiajaponin). The separation of a 50% ethanol extract of the dried endosperms yielded gnetin C, gnetin L (new stilbenoid), gnemonosides A, C and D, and resveratrol which were tested for DPPH radical scavenging action, antimicrobial activity and inhibition of lipase and Œ±-amylase from porcine pancreas. Gnetin C showed the best effect among these stilbenoids. Oral administration of the 50% ethanol extract of melinjo fruit at 100 mg/kg/day significantly enhanced the production of the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-Œ≥ irrespective of concanavalin-A stimulation, whereas the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 was not affected. New stilbene glucosides gnemonoside L and gnemonoside M, and known stilbenoids resveratrol, isorhapontigenin, gnemonoside D, gnetins C and E were isolated from the extract.

It is the headquarters of Purba Bardhaman district, having become a district capital during the period of British rule. Burdwan, an alternative name for the city, has remained in use since that period. The history of Burdwan is known from about 5000 BC (the Mesolithic or Late Stone Age). The origin of this name dates back to the 6th century BCE and is ascribed to Vardhaman Swami or Mahavira (599-527 BCE), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, who spent some time in Astikagrama, according to the Jain scripture of Kalpasutra. This place was renamed as Vardhamana in his honour. History During the period of Jahangir this place was named Badh-e-dewan (district capital). The city owes its historical importance to being the headquarters of the Maharajas of Burdwan, the premier noblemen of lower Bengal, whose rent- roll was upwards of 300,000. Bardhaman Raj was founded in 1657 by Sangam Rai, of a Hindu Khatri family of Kotli in Lahore, Punjab, whose descendants served in turn the Mughal Emperors and the British government. The East Indian Railway from Howrah was opened in 1855. The great prosperity of the raj was due to the excellent management of Maharaja Mahtab Chand (died 1879), whose loyalty to the government especially during the \\"Hul\\" (Santhal rebellion) of 1855-56 and the Indian rebellion of 1857 was rewarded with the grant of a coat of arms in 1868 and the right to a personal salute of 13 guns in 1877. Maharaja Bijaychand Mahtab (born 1881), who succeeded his adoptive father in 1888, earned great distinction by the courage with which he risked his life to save that of Sir Andrew Fraser, the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, on the occasion of the attempt to assassinate him made by freedom fighters of Bengal on 7 November 1908. Mahtab Chand Bahadur and later Bijoy Chand Mahtab struggled their best to make this region culturally, economically and ecologically healthier. The chief educational institution was the Burdwan Raj College, which was entirely supported out of the maharaja's estate. Sadhak Kamalakanta as composer of devotional songs and Kashiram Das as a poet and translator of the great Mahabharata were possibly the best products of such an endeavour. Pratap Chandra Roy was the publisher of the first translation in the world to translate Mahabharata in English (1883‚Äì1896). The society at large also continued to gain the fruits. We find, among others, the great rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and Kala-azar-famed U. N. Brahmachari as the relatively recent illustrious sons of this soil. Batukeshwar Dutt an Indian revolutionary and independence fighter in the early 1900s was born on 18 November 1910 in a village Oari in Burdwan district. He is best known for having exploded a few bombs, along with Bhagat Singh, in the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi on 8 April 1929. The city became an important centre of North-Indian classical music as well. Geography=Location The region has an average elevation of 40 metres (131 ft). The city is situated 1100 km from New Delhi and a little less than 100 km north- west of Kolkata on the Grand Trunk Road (National Highway 19) and Eastern Railway. The chief rivers are the Damodar and the Banka. The first epigraphic reference to the name of this place occurs in a 6th-century AD copper plate found in Mallasarul village under Galsi Police Station. Archeological evidences suggest that this region, forming a major part of Radh Bengal, could be traced even back to 4000 BCE. Map of purba bardhaman district Police stations Burdwan police station has jurisdiction over Bardhaman municipal area and Burdwan I and Burdwan II CD Blocks. The area covered is 192.15 km2.

Effective literacy rate for the 7+ population was 88.62%. Climate The K√∂ppen Climate Classification sub-type for this climate is \\"Aw\\" (tropical savanna climate). Culture Burdwan has a multi-cultural heritage. The deuls (temples of rekha type) found here are reminiscent of Bengali Hindu architecture. The old temples bear signs of Hinduism, mostly belonging to the Sakta and Vaishnava followers. The Kankaleswari Kali is also located in the city of Burdwan. Burdwan experienced and survived numerous violent conflicts, mainly due to Mughal, Pashtun and Maratha invaders. The city of Bardhaman was visited by notables of the Delhi Sultanate from Raja Todarmal to Daud Karnani, from Sher Afghan and Kutub-ud-din to Ajimuswan to the future Mughal emperor Shah Jahan while he was still a rebel. Bardhaman also has a number of Bengali Christians, and although they are a minority, there are many churches in the city.

Education=University The University of Burdwan was formally inaugurated on 15 June 1960 by Sukumar Sen, its first Vice-chancellor. It was after the abolition of the Zamindari system in the fifties that Uday Chand Mahtab, the last representative of the Burdwan Raj, left almost his entire property in Burdwan to the state government. This, coupled with the initiative of the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Roy, facilitated the establishment of this university. Presently, the administrative works are mostly done at the Rajbati (the palace of Barddhamana Maharaja) campus; on the other hand, academic activities centre on the Golapbag campus. With social responsibilities in mind, the university actively patronised the construction of a science centre and the Meghnad Saha Planetarium.

The former royal palace is located 1 km from the gate. The pomp and grandeur of Lord Curzon's visit to Bardhaman in 1904 established the name of the gate as Curzon Gate. It is also known as Bijay Toran.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol II, pages 565-576, Radical Impression. * Tombs of Sher Afgan and Qutbuddin Khan Koka - Mehr-un-Nissa, then wife of Sher Afgan, jagirdar of Bardhaman, was once a resident of Bardhaman. It is said that the Mughal emperor Jahangir had fallen in love with her and was determined to marry her. He tried to get her with the help of his foster-brother and subahdar of Bengal, Qutbuddin Khan Koka. Sher Afgan died during a fight with Qutbuddin Khan Koka, who also was killed. Both were buried side by side at Bardhaman in 1607 (or 1610 according to some sources), in the same place as Pir Baharam Sikka, a Persian Sufi saint.

It is located at East 149th Street and Grand Concourse in Mott Haven and Melrose in the Bronx. The complex is served by the 2 and 4 trains at all times, and by the 5 train at all times except late nights. Station layout=Exits There are two exit stairs each to the southwest and southeast corners of 149th Street and Grand Concourse. Elevators When the station was first opened, the only way to exit the station was through two elevators. The elevators had four levels: one at the northbound lower level platform, one at the level of a pedestrian overpass connecting the two lower level platforms at their southern ends, one at the mezzanine of the upper level platforms (added when those platforms were opened), and one at a street-level headhouse. When the elevators were opened up for service, they were considered state-of-the-art at the time, holding up to 20 people. However, the elevators and areas near the elevators were closed in 1975 due to security reasons. The MTA initially stated in February 2014 that there were no plans to reopen them as the station itself \\"was not a main station\\". In 2013, several local institutions and groups of riders protested in support of restoring elevator access to the station. All platforms are planned to receive full ADA accessibility as part of the MTA's 2015-2019 Capital Program. In December 2015, the MTA initially agreed to repair both elevators in addition to installing another one across the street. It was estimated that $45 million would go towards this previous elevator installation and repair plan. The MTA currently plans to rebuild one of the two original elevators so that it operates from the headhouse to the pedestrian overpass above the lower level platforms, and build two new elevators with three stops: either upper level platform, the overpass, and either lower level platform. A new fare control area will be built somewhere in the overpass level. It is estimated that \\"over $50 million\\" will go towards the current installation and repair plan. Additionally, construction on new elevators and the refurbishment of the existing elevator is expected to start as early as late October 2020, three months after a \\"preliminary design stage.\\"http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-announces- accelerated-accessibility-projects-bronx-subway-complex-and  Unbuilt New York Central Railroad station  There are some remaining signs on the walls that point to a never-built station of the New York Central Railroad lines (now part of Metro-North Railroad). The station had been approved in 1908 and would have been located at 149th Street and Park Avenue, one block east.  IRT Jerome Avenue Line platforms  149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse is an express station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line that has three tracks and two island platforms, with the center track used during rush hours in the peak direction. This station is on the upper level of the two-level station complex, with a free transfer to the IRT White Plains Road Line on the lower level. The station was opened on June 2, 1917, and was the southern terminus of the Jerome Avenue Line until it was extended through Mott Haven Avenue into the Upper East Side extension of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.  IRT White Plains Road Line platforms  149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse on the IRT White Plains Road Line has two tracks and two side platforms. There is a high rounded ceiling that is visible at the west end of the station and is similar in design to those of 168th Street and 181st Street stations on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line. The IRT White Plains Road Line platforms are located on the lower level of this two level complex. Originally opened as Mott Avenue on July 10, 1905, 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse was the first subway station to be opened in the Bronx. The original headhouse is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Today, all of the original mosaic \\"Mott Avenue\\" name tablets have been covered over with metal \\"149 St‚ÄìGrand Concourse\\" signs. Only one name tablet, located on the downtown platform between the last two staircases at the northern end, remained uncovered and survived intact until a few years into the 21st century when a serious water leak after very heavy rainfall caused individual tiles to separate from the wall and fall off. There were no known plans by the MTA to repair or restore this name tablet. In the fall of 2011, the MTA covered this name tablet with a metal \\"149 St‚ÄìGrand Concourse\\" sign. South of the station, there are track connections to the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. The line splits and makes a sharp turn to merge with the Jerome Avenue Line just south of the upper level station. Due to high usage levels and the sharp turn of the connection, it often causes delays on the 5 train. The White Plains Road Line continues straight under the Harlem River and merges with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line at 142nd Street Junction. From the time of the opening of the station in 1905 until 2002, there were no columns between the northbound and southbound tracks, allowing an unobstructed view across the station. Thin supports for a communications conduit have since been installed.

A member of the Greek resistance to Axis rule during WWII, he later became a prominent anti-war activist. His assassination by right-wing zealots provoked mass protests and led to a political crisis. Early life Lambrakis was born in the village of Kerasitsa in the district of Tegea (Arcadia, the Peloponnese). After finishing high school in his home town, he moved to Athens to enter the School of Medicine at the University of Athens. Lambrakis was a champion athlete throughout his life. He held the Greek record for long jump for twenty-three years (1936-1959). He also earned several gold medals in the Balkan Games, which took place annually, featuring competitors from Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. He competed in the men's long jump and the men's triple jump at the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II (1941-44), Lambrakis participated actively in the Greek Resistance. In 1943 he set up the Union of Greek Athletes (ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ œÑœâŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑœéŒΩ, Enosi ton Ell√≠non Athlit√≥n) and organized regular competitions. He used the revenue from these games to fund public food-banks for the starving population.  Postwar activism After World War II, Lambrakis completed his medical studies and worked as a lecturer in the Department of gynaecology. He continued to help the poor by running a small private clinic for patients who were unable to afford medical care. While not a Communist, Lambrakis' political and ideological orientation leaned towards the left. He was actively involved in the pacifist movement of his time, which voiced strong opposition to the Vietnam War. Lambrakis acted politically from within the United Democratic Left (', ŒïŒîŒë/Eni√©a Dimokratik√≠ Arister√°, EDA), the only legal left-wing political party in the country after the Greek Civil War of 1946-1949 and until the fall of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974. He was elected to the Hellenic Parliament in the 1961 Greek legislative election as a Piraeus MP. That same year (1961), under his initiative, the Commission for International D√©tente and Peace (EœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒîŒπŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒÆ ŒéœÜŒµœÉŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒïŒπœÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑ -- Epitrop√≠ gia ti Diethn√≠ √ùfesi ke Ir√≠ni -- EDYE) was established in Greece. In his capacity as Vice President of EDYE, Lambrakis participated in international pacifist meetings and demonstrations despite frequent threats against his life. EDYE was an organization set up by EDA which while not officially aligned to the World Council of Peace broadly supported its anti- capitalist and anti-imperialist position. EDA had ceded Lambrakis full freedom to represent the Commission and he soon emerged as its most articulate and determined leader. On , the pacifist movement in Greece organized the First Pacifist Rally from Marathon to Athens. The police intervened, banned the rally and arrested many demonstrators (Mikis Theodorakis among them). Lambrakis, protected by his parliamentary immunity, marched alone and arrived at the end of the rally holding the banner with the peace symbol (photo), the one that he had previously held up during the Aldermaston rally in the United Kingdom while he was protesting near the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE). Soon afterward, he too was arrested by the police. Assassination On , shortly after he had delivered the keynote speech at an anti-war meeting in Thessaloniki, two far-right extremists, Emannouel Emannouilides and Spyros Gotzamanis, driving a three-wheeled vehicle, struck Lambrakis with a club over the head in plain view of a large number of people and (allegedly) some police officers. He suffered brain injuries and died in the hospital five days later, on . The two men were arrested because of the reaction of a by-stander (Manolis Hatziapostolou, nicknamed Tiger) who jumped on their vehicle and fought with them. Events following his assassination The next day, in Athens, his funeral became a massive demonstration. More than 500,000 people rallied to protest against the right-wing government and the Royal Court, seen by many to support the activities of the right-wing extremists. The assassination of Lambrakis initiated an enormous popular reaction, and soon after, investigator Christos Sartzetakis, district attorney Nikos Athanasopoulos and attorney general P. Delaportas uncovered connections of the police and army, including the Gendarmerie commander for Northern Greece, Konstantinos Mitsou, and various local police officers, like Kapelonis and Katsoulis, to far-right extremists.Gkotzaridis, Evi (December 2017) \\"Who Really Rules this Country!' Collusion between State and Deep State in post- Civil War Greece and the Murder of Independent MP Grigorios Lambrakis. 1958-1963,\\" DIPLOMACY & STATECRAFT, 28 (4): 646-673. The judges lost their jobs during the military dictatorship of 1967. Christos Sartzetakis was also imprisoned for a year during the dictatorship. The two murderers were released, while members of the conspiracy were favored. Sartzetakis, although a royalist himself, became a symbol of integrity for his handling of the investigation. The events that followed the assassination of Lambrakis led to rapid political developments. Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis resigned and left for Paris in July 1963. Soon thereafter, thousands of Greek youth founded a new political organisation called the Lambrakis Democratic Youth (, Dimokratik√≠ Neol√©a Lambr√°ki). Mikis Theodorakis, one of Lambrakis' friends and fellow activists, was elected its first president. This leftist political organisation played a decisive role in Greece's progressive movement of the 1960s. In 1966 a 'Greek Demokratic Youth of Australia Lambrakis' was formed in all capitals of the States of Australia by young Greek workers and students. Legacy The life and death of Grigoris Lambrakis inspired the author Vassilis Vassilikos to write the political novel \\"Z\\". The title stands for the first letter of the Greek word \\"Zi\\" (\\"[He] Lives!\\"), a popular graffito which began to appear on the walls of the buildings of the Greek cities in the 1960s, illustrating the growing protest against the conditions that led to the assassination of Lambrakis. In 1969, the Greek-French film director Costa- Gavras (ŒöœéœÉœÑŒ±œÇ ŒìŒ±Œ≤œÅŒ¨œÇ) made the film Z, which was a great success. Yves Montand starred as Lambrakis, Jean-Louis Trintignant as investigator Sartzetakis and Irene Papas as Lambrakis' widow. Mikis Theodorakis in 1962 presented his work Omiros (Hostage), a music score for a Greek performance of The Hostage (play) by Brendan Behan. The piece To Yelasto Pedi (The Smiling Kid) was considered to be a tribute to Lambrakis, and as such was also used in the film Z. Lambrakis remained in the hearts of the Greek people as a national symbol of democracy, representing the struggle against political repression, Royal Court scandal, and international dependence. After the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974, numerous places, including a football stadium in Kallithea and streets and squares throughout the country, have been named in honor of Grigoris Lambrakis. The Marathon Peace Rally became an annual event in Lambrakis' memory. Also, the Athens Classic Marathon is run in memory of Grigoris Lambrakis every November.

It is the only member of the genus Parascalops. The species epithet breweri refers to Thomas Mayo Brewer, an American naturalist.  Appearance  This animal has dark grey fur with lighter underparts, a pointed nose and a short, hairy tail. It is about in length, including a tail, and weighs about . Its front paws are broad and spade-shaped, specialized for digging. It has 44 teeth. Its eyes are covered by fur and its ears are not external. Its feet and snout are pinkish, but become white in older animals. Several adaptations to living primarily underground can be seen in the hairy-tailed mole. Its pelage is very dense and silky, and its feet are broad, flat, and heavy. Moles rely very little on their eyesight and have very small optic nerves. To accommodate its lack of vision, the hairy-tailed mole has sensitive whiskers and hairs on the tip of its nose and feet to feel its surroundings.  Habitat  It is found in forested and open areas with dry loose soils in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Since it is a fossorial mammal, it needs moist but well-drained soil so that it can dig easily. The hairy-tailed mole prefers deciduous and coniferous woods, oldfields, and roadsides.  Behavior  The hairy-tailed mole is cathemeral. Since it lives primarily underground in shallow tunnels it can forage throughout the day and will also forage on the ground's surface at night. The hairy-tailed mole is more active near the surface during warmer summer months and digs deeper underground in the cooler fall and winter months. This mole spends most of its time underground, foraging in shallow burrows for insects and their larvae and earthworms. It emerges at night to feed. It is active year-round. Predators include owls, foxes and large snakes. This animal is mainly solitary except during mating in early spring. The female has a litter of 4 to 5 young in a deep burrow. This mole may live 3 to 4 years. Diet Hairy-tailed moles are insectivores and have been shown to starve if vegetable matter is the only food source available. The hairy-tailed mole's diet is mostly grubs, earthworms, beetle larvae, slugs, and ants, particularly when other food sources are not available.

Biography Isaiah Horowitz was born in Prague around 1555. Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: His first teacher was his father, Avraham ben Shabtai Sheftel Horowitz, a notable scholar and author, and a disciple of Moses Isserles (Rema). Horowitz studied under Meir Lublin and Joshua Falk. He married Chaya, daughter of Abraham Moul, of Vienna, and was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting Torah study, especially in Jerusalem. In 1590, in Lublin, he participated in a meeting of the Council of Four Lands, and his signature appears on a decree that condemns the purchase of rabbinic positions. In 1602, Isaiah Horowitz was appointed Av Beit Din in Austria, and in 1606 was appointed Rabbi of Frankfurt. In 1614, after serving as rabbi in prominent cities in Europe, he left following the Fettmilch Uprising and assumed the prestigious position of chief rabbi of Prague. In 1621, after the death of his wife, he moved to Israel, was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem, and married Hava, daughter of Eleazer. In 1625, he was kidnapped and imprisoned, together with 15 other Jewish rabbis and scholars, by the Pasha (Ibn Faruh) and held for ransom. After 1626, Horowitz moved to Safed, erstwhile home of Kabbalah, and later died in Tiberias on March 24, 1630 (Nisan 11, 5390 on the Hebrew calendar). In his many kabbalistic, homiletic and halachic works, he stressed the joy in every action, and how one should convert the evil inclination into good, two concepts that influenced Jewish thought through to the eighteenth-century, and greatly influenced the development of Hasidic Judaism. Famous descendants of Isaiah Horowitz included Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin (known as \\"The Seer of Lublin\\"), the prominent Billiczer rabbinical family of Szerencs, Hungary and the Dym family of rabbis and communal leaders in Galicia, Aaron HaLevi ben Moses of Staroselye (a prominent student of Shneur Zalman of Liadi), the Fruchter-Langer families and Rabbi Meir Zelig Mann of Memel, Lithuania (b. 1921, d. 2008). Works His most important work Shenei Lu·∏•ot HaBerit (, Two Tablets of the Covenant, abbreviated Shelah ), is an encyclopedic compilation of ritual, ethics, and mysticism. It was originally intended as an ethical will - written as a compendium of the Jewish religion. The title page of the first edition states that the work is \\"compiled from both Torahs, Written and Oral, handed down from Sinai\\". The work has had a profound influence on Jewish life - notably, on the early Hasidic movement, including the Baal Shem Tov; Shneur Zalman of Liadi was described as a \\"Shelah Yid\\", and Shelah clearly echoes in his work, Tanya. The work was first published in 1648 by his son, Shabbethai Horowitz, and has been often reprinted, especially in an abbreviated form. (See also ◊©◊†◊ô ◊ú◊ï◊ó◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ article in the Hebrew Wikipedia). Horowitz also wrote the Sha'ar ha-Shamayim siddur (prayer book) which had an influence on the later Ashkenazi nusach. Tefillat HaShlah - The Shelah's Prayer Rabbi Horowitz wrote that the eve of the first day of the month of Sivan is the most auspicious time to pray for the physical and spiritual welfare of one's children and grandchildren, since Sivan was the month that the Torah was given to the Jewish people. He composed a special prayer to be said on this day, known as the Tefillat HaShlah \\"the Shelah's Prayer\\". In modern times, the custom of saying this prayer on the appointed day has become very popular among Orthodox parents.

Its summit, on the western edge of Gloucestershire and its northern slopes in Herefordshire, is readily distinguishable by a clump of trees on its summit, which forms an official Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is reached by three public footpaths, two forming parts of the Gloucestershire Way and Wysis Way. Toponymy There is an unverified story that May Hill was named after a certain Captain May who used it as a landmark when navigating the Severn estuary, but documents from a couple of hundred years ago relate that the hill was known as Yartleton Hill and was renamed because of the May Day events held there. Page 39. Each May Day, morris dancers dance in the new dawn on the top of May Hill and hundreds of observers join in the celebration. A ceremony on May Day morning has been carried out for several centuries; originally it included a mock battle between youths. Geography The Severn from May Hill May Hill forms part of a low range of hills separating the River Severn from the River Wye. The summit is above sea level. Among the trees there are several benches from which the views in all directions can be seen. They include views to the Welsh borders, and the lower reaches of the River Severn, bypassed for shipping by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. Geology May Hill is formed of sandstones and siltstones known as the May Hill sandstone, consisting of the Huntley Hill and Yartleton formations. These rocks date from the Early Silurian period and are formed into a dome, cut through by several faults. The most significant of these is the Blaisdon Fault, which forms the eastern boundary of May Hill and separates it from the younger rocks of the Severn Vale. Ecology and SSSI status The top of May Hill () is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1954.Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Sites of Special Scientific Interest The site is listed in the Forest of Dean Local Plan Review as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Key Wildlife Sites Much of the Hill is wooded, both coniferous and deciduous, though the summit area is grassland and heath, with a small amount of heather and gorse. The immediate summit is topped with mature Corsican pines, which were planted in 1887 to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and one very old Scots Pine which is a generation older, but which regrettably suffered badly in an ice storm in early 2012. These trees make May Hill an easily identifiable landmark from many miles away. The younger trees around were planted to mark Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee. Early maps and accounts show a clump of trees on the top before these plantings. Birds to be seen on the hill include meadow pipit, tree pipit, redstart and raven, whilst the woods below have a good population of woodcock. History The hill includes a circular trench 100 metres in diameter said to be an Iron Age earthwork, surrounding a mound that is probably a round barrow. There are records of a clump of trees on the summit of May Hill dating back to the later 18th century. The hill was enclosed by an Act of Parliament in 1873. The dwindling clump was replenished in time for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, when most of the trees that give the hill its distinctive character today were planted. Pages 22-24. An area of 30 ha of the hill passed into the care of the National Trust in 1935, although the summit has remained vested with Longhope Parish Council and registered as a village green. There was further replenishment of the trees in 1977 for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. A plaque on the summit commemorating this reads: The site boundary was amended in 1983. May Hill in cultural life May Hill is associated with the poets Edward Thomas and Robert Frost. John Masefield describes May Hill in his poem \\"The Everlasting Mercy\\". Ivor Gurney eulogised \\"May Hill that Gloucester dwellers 'gainst every sunset see.\\" Composer Gerald Finzi's ashes were scattered on the top in 1973.McVeagh, Diana M. _Gerald Finzi: His Life and Music_ (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell Press, 2005), p. 251. One of the benches on the summit is dedicated to the Forest of Dean chronicler Winifred Foley and her husband, who moved in the 1970s to the nearby village of Cliffords Mesne. A charming book of paintings and drawings of May Hill has been published by the artist Valerie McLean.

It includes the hamlets of Zgornje Dom≈æale (; ), Spodnje Dom≈æale (; ), and ≈†tuda. Dom≈æale is known today for its small businesses, agriculture, and light industry. Name Dom≈æale was attested in written sources circa 1200‚Äì1230 as Domsselsdorf (and as Vnheilden dorf in 1260, Vnsselsdorf in 1302, Vnsersdorf in 1322, Dumsel in 1490, and Damschale in 1558, among other variations.) The medieval German name Unser(s)dorf is derived from (D)unselsdorf, which was presumably borrowed from the Slovene name and from which the initial D- was lost because it was reanalyzed as a definite article. The Slovene name could be reconstructed as *Dom≈æaƒæe, based on a Slavic personal name such as *Domo≈æal—ä and referring to an early inhabitant of the place.

In the , Greenvale had a population of 232 people. Geography Greenvale is a nickel mining area, approximately northwest of Townsville. Other metal ores are also extracted there. It lies on the banks of the Burdekin River and on the Gregory Developmental Road. A good sealed road crosses the hills over to Townsville. An ore-carrying railway line ran between Greenvale and Queensland Nickel Industries (QNI) processing plant at Yabulu, approximately north of Townsville from 1974 to 1993.  History  Gugu Badhun (also known as Koko-Badun and Kokopatun) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Charters Towers Region, particularly the localities of Greenvale and the Valley of Lagoons, and in the Upper Burdekin River area and in Abergowrie. The town was named by the Queensland Place Names Board on 16 December 1972. The town takes its name from a pastoral run operated by John Langton in 1860s. Greenvale Project No 2 State School opened on 22 May 1972 and closed on 18 October 1974. This is most likely to have been a school serving a construction camp. Greenvale Project No 1 State School opened 18 February 1974. It closed on 29 March 1974. Greenvale State School opened on 18 September 1972. Greenvale Post Office opened on 1 November 1973. Some of the longest trains in Australia were pulled along the railway line. The railway line tracks were removed in mid-2000; however the bridges, cuttings, blue metal and easement remain. Occasionally people walk from Yabulu to Greenvale along it, as a form of fundraising. Despite the fact that the mine itself has since concluded operations, more mining operations around the area have since commenced and homes are all fully occupied with workers supporting the regional mining and exploration. When the nickel mine was in operation, its population was estimated to be 650 people. The 2006 Census Data states that 255 people were living in the Greenvale within the Dalrymple Shire.  Education  Greenvale State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at Cassia Court (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 31 students with 3 teachers and 8 non-teaching staff (4 full-time equivalent).  Attractions  There are no real sights at Greenvale; the nearest site of interest would be Undara Volcanic National Park approximately to the north. The Three Rivers Hotel, made famous by Slim Dusty in a song by the same name, is now located at Greenvale. This is not the actual hotel where the song was penned by Stan Coster. The hotel reference is actually to the \\"Mess Hall\\" at the construction camp where Stan Coster penned the song. Stan worked as Grader operator for Thiess Brothers on the construction of the railway line. The origin of the name \\"Three Rivers Hotel\\" is not because the \\"hotel\\" was ever at the junction of the three rivers - Burdekin, Star and Clarke as stated on numerous web sites. The lyrics mentions the camp at the Star River. This was one of 6 camps that existed on the length of the Greenvale line . During 1974 North Queensland was severely drenched by a very active wet season and work on the railway line ceased for days, even weeks, on end. The workers in the camps had nothing better to do than spend the day in the camp \\"boozer\\". Each camp had a boozer which was a basic demountable building with outdoor covered seating. During one of these wet days the water started to enter the confines of the boozer and immediately some of the men started digging some improvised drainage around the boozer to channel away the water. As they built the channels, some wags named them after the 3 main rivers (Burdekin, Star and Clarke). These were joined up roughly as they do in real life and the boozer named \\"the Three Rivers Hotel\\". One of the drinkers that day was Stan Coster who penned the song on the spot in the bar and performed it for the drinkers. The three rivers referred in the song do not join up at one point but the Star and the Clarke join the Burdekin at completely separate locations and therefore there could be no hotel on the \\"junction\\" of the three rivers the song refers to. There is a 9-hole golf course, caravan park and general store/mini supermarket. The hotel serves meals and has a number of self-contained units once used by the mine to house staff and contractors. Transport Greenvale is on the Gregory Highway and has an airport. Scandium deposits The Greenvale mining lease has undergone extensive exploration work by Straits Resources and Metallica Minerals for the purpose of reopening the nickel and cobalt operations. The surrounding areas have extensive nickel and cobalt mineralisation. During this most recent exploration work, the Lucknow ridge south of the mine has been found to contain one of the largest known reserves of scandium oxide in the Lateritic nickel ore deposits. According to the managing director of Metallica Minerals, Andrew Gillies, the deposit's quality and purity are remarkably high.Edwina Farley (Friday 14 October 2011) \\"National Rural News week ending 14/10/2011 - One of the world's largest scandium deposits found in Queensland\\".

Taxonomy Two subspecies are recognized: the nominate, S. o. orarius, and Scheffer's coast mole, S. o. schefferi. The nominate has a shorter skull and less enlarged maxillary region. The patterns of teeth shearing on dirt and earthworms (their main diet) set both subspecies apart from similar species.  Description  The coast mole is generally less than 200 mm long, with the tail being one-fourth of its total length. The fur is uniformly black. The skull is relatively narrow and long, with a sublacrimal-maxillary ridge that is underdeveloped. Teeth are uncrowned and evenly spaced.  Distribution and habitat  The coast mole has a disjunct distribution, occurring from the western end of British Columbia, Canada through the western regions of Oregon and Washington, and in some parts of Northern California (coastal regions). The most extreme divergence of range for the coast mole has been seen to reach some parts of west-central Idaho. The species has a primarily fossorial lifestyle, but is not restricted solely to underground habitats. Like many other species of moles, it is capable of surfacing for scavenging purposes and juvenile dispersals, especially in the summer months. It may inhabit, but is not restricted to, agricultural land, sand dunes, grassy-meadows, sage brush, deciduous forest, and pine forests (woodpine, hemlock, and redwood). Ecology= Diet  Coast moles are insectivores, harvesting earthworms in the soil in moderately moist environments. Coast moles will increase their digging activity when they sense shifting densities of earthworms. Food items found in coast mole stomachs included earthworms (the majority by mass), slugs, earthworm eggs, and larval and adult insects.  Behavior  The coast mole is primarily solitary and only become social during mating season. Coast mole populations and their corresponding tunnel systems seem to be larger in areas with damp soil and high earthworm densities. Coast moles are primarily nocturnal, but do not confine their activities to any specific part of the night. It has been found that an individual mole's activities tend to be asynchronous to those of neighboring moles.  Mating and Reproduction  Mating usually occurs in period from late January and early March. During this time, coast moles will diverge from their normal solitary lifestyles and begin expanding their tunnel systems, even venturing into other coast mole tunnel systems in attempts to find a mating partner. Little is known about their gestation and nursing behavior. Females produce a single litter per year, and maternal care is limited. Coast mole offspring can become reproductively active within nine to ten months of birth.  Adaptation to burrowing lifestyle  Coast moles primarily use their noses for sensing their surroundings underground. Eimer's organ is a small, densely innervated sensory structure found in the nose of most talpid moles, including the coast mole, which seems to play a critical role in tactile discrimination and enables it to differentiate between prey items in an environment with little to no visual input. Moles and monotremes appear to have developed this as a convergent structure, using common components of mammalian skin to maximize tactile sensitivity. Air supply in coast mole tunnels may be short on oxygen, but enriched with carbon dioxide from respiration. One adaptation to these environmental challenges is an increased blood volume for oxygen storage. Another is a modified hemoglobin, found in the coast mole and the eastern mole, that allows for heightened Cl- ion binding activity that is not affected by the relatively cold temperatures of mole tunnels. Conservation The species has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, since it appears to be common in a wide variety of habitats throughout its range.

This patent was made by Verona Pearl Amoth, who also invented other tools of the field like replaceable erasers for pencils.

Herodas (Greek: ), or Herondas (the name is spelt differently in the few places where he is mentioned), was a Greek poet and the author of short humorous dramatic scenes in verse, probably written in Alexandria during the 3rd century BC.Headlam, Herodas (Cambridge, 1922) ix. Apart from the intrinsic merit of these pieces, they are interesting in the history of Greek literature as being a new species, illustrating Alexandrian methods. They are called Mimiamboi (Greek: ŒºŒπŒºŒØŒ±ŒºŒ≤ŒøŒπ, \\"Mime-iambics\\"), or mimes. Mimes were the Dorian product of South Italy and Sicily, and the most famous of them ‚Äì from which Plato is said to have studied the drawing of character ‚Äì were the work of Sophron. These were scenes in popular life, written in the language of the people, vigorous with sexual proverbs such as we get in other reflections of that region ‚Äì in Petronius and the Pentamerone. Two of the best known and the most vital among the Idylls of Theocritus, the 2nd and the 15th, we know to have been derived from mimes of Sophron. What Theocritus is doing there, Herodas, his younger contemporary, is doing in another manner ‚Äì casting old material into novel form, upon a small scale, under strict conditions of technique. The method is entirely Alexandrian: Sophron had written in a peculiar kind of rhythmical prose; Theocritus uses the hexameter and Doric, Herodas the scazon or \\"lame\\" iambic (with a dragging spondee at the end) and the old Ionic dialect with which that curious metre was associated. That, however, hardly goes beyond the choice and form of words; the structure of the sentences is close-knit Attic. Herodas did not write his mimiambics in the contemporary Greek koine of his period. Rather, he affected a quaint style that imitated the Greek spoken in the 6th century BC. (Cunningham 14) But the grumbling metre and quaint language suit the tone of common life that Herodas aims at realizing; for, as Theocritus may be called idealist, Herodas is an unflinching realist. His persons talk in vehement exclamations and emphatic turns of speech, with proverbs and fixed phrases; and occasionally, where it is designed as proper to the part, with the most naked coarseness of expression. The scene of the second and the fourth is laid at Cos, and the speaking characters in each are never more than three. Herodas' mimes=Mime I In Mime I the old nurse, now the professional go-between or bawd, calls on Metriche, whose husband has been long away in Egypt, and endeavours to excite her interest in a most desirable young man, fallen deeply in love with her at first sight. After hearing all the arguments Metriche declines with dignity, but consoles the old woman with an ample glass of wine, this kind being always represented with the taste of Mrs Gamp. Mime II This is a monologue by the \\"whoremonger\\" prosecuting a merchant-trader for breaking into his establishment at night and attempting to carry off one of the inmates, who is produced in court. The vulgar blackguard, who is a stranger to any sort of shame, remarking that he has no evidence to call, proceeds to a peroration in the regular oratorical style, appealing to the Coan judges not to be unworthy of their traditional glories. In fact, the whole oration is also a burlesque in every detail of an Attic speech at law; and in this case we have the material from which to estimate the excellence of the parody. Mime III Metrotim√©, a desperate mother, brings to the schoolmaster Lampriscos her truant son, Cottalos, with whom neither she nor his incapable old father can do anything. In a voluble stream of interminable sentences she narrates his misdeeds and implores the schoolmaster to flog him. The boy accordingly is hoisted on another's back and flogged; but his spirit does not appear to be subdued, and the mother resorts to the old man after all. Mime IV This is a visit of two poor women with an offering to the temple of Asclepius at Cos. While the humble cock is being sacrificed, they turn, like the women in the Ion of Euripides, to admire the works of art; among them a small boy strangling a vulpanser ‚Äì doubtless the work of Boethus that we know and a sacrificial procession by Apelles, \\"the Ephesian,\\" of whom we have an interesting piece of contemporary eulogy. The oily sacristan is admirably painted in a few slight strokes. Mime V The jealous woman accuses one of her slaves, whom she has made her favourite, of infidelity; has him bound and sent degraded through the town to receive 2000 lashes; no sooner is he out of sight than she recalls him to be branded \\"at one job.\\" The only pleasing person in the piece is the little maidservant permitted liberties as a verna brought up in the house whose ready tact suggests to her mistress an excuse for postponing execution of a threat made in ungovernable fury. Mime VI A friendly chat or a private conversation. The subject is a domestic one; Metro has arrived at Koritto's house to ask her where she acquired a dildo, but the dialogue is as clever and amusing as the rest, with some delightful touches. Our interest is engaged here in a certain Kerdon, the maker of the dildo and who hides this trade by the front of being a cobbler. On acquiring the information she desired, Metro leaves to seek him out. Mime VII The same Kerdon and Metro whom we see in VI appear, Metro bringing some friends to Kerdon's shoe shop, (his name, which means \\"profiteer\\", had already become generic for the shoemaker as the typical representative of retail trade) he is a little bald man with a fluent tongue, complaining of hard times, who bluffs and wheedles by turns. The sexual undertones which we have come to expect from his involvement in VI are only realised at the end when Metro's friends have left the shop. Mime VIII Opens with the poet waking up his servants to listen to his dream; but we have only the beginning, and the other fragments are very short. Within the limits of 100 lines or less Herodas presents us with a highly entertaining scene and with characters definitely drawn. Discussion Some of these had been perfected no doubt upon the Attic stage, where the tendency in the 4th century had been gradually to evolve accepted types‚Äînot individuals, but generalizations from a class, an art in which Menander's was esteemed the master-hand. Their effect is achieved by true dramatic means, with touches never wasted and the more delightful often because they do not clamour for attention. The execution has the qualities of first-rate Alexandrian work in miniature, such as the epigrams of Asclepiades possess, the finish and firm outlines; and these little pictures bear the test of all artistic work ‚Äì they do not lose their freshness with familiarity, and gain in interest as one learns to appreciate their subtle points.

Cut and voided silk velvet Detail of crochet tablecloth A tablecloth is a cloth used to cover a table. Some are mainly ornamental coverings, which may also help protect the table from scratches and stains. Other tablecloths are designed to be spread on a dining table before laying out tableware and food. Some tablecloths are designed as part of an overall table setting, with coordinating napkins, placemats, or other decorative pieces. Special kinds of tablecloth include \\"runners\\" which overhang the table at two ends only and \\"table protectors\\" which provide a padded layer under a normal tablecloth. Shapes and sizes The most common shapes for tablecloths are round, square, oval, and oblong, or rectangular, corresponding to the most common table shapes. Tablecloths usually have an overhang, referred to as the \\"drop.\\" The drop is generally 6 to 15 inches on each side of the table, with a shorter drop for casual dining and a longer drop for more formal occasions. Sometimes a floor-length cloth is used. Custom-made tablecloths are also available, and some people choose to make their own. Fabrics and care Today, dining tablecloths are typically made of cotton, a poly-cotton blend, or a PVC-coated material that can be wiped clean, but they can be made of almost any material, including delicate fabrics like embroidered silk. Ease of laundering is an important consideration for tablecloths used for dining, as they are easily soiled. History In many European cultures a white, or mainly white, tablecloth used to be the standard covering for a dinner table. In the later medieval period, spreading a high quality white linen or cotton cloth on the table was an important part of preparing for a feast in a wealthy household. Over time, the custom of arranging tableware on a cloth became common for most social classes except the very poorest. As eating habits changed in the 20th century, a much greater range of table-setting styles developed. Some formal dinners still use white tablecloths, often with a damask weave, but other colours and patterns are also common. Special cases Perugia tablecloths and napkins have been made since medieval times. These cloths are white with characteristic woven blue stripes and patterns. This style is also associated with church linen. Victorian interiors were full of thick, fringed draperies in deep colours, including tablecloths reaching the floor.Bott and Clephane, Our Mothers, Gollancz 1932, p60 Cultural references A popular \\"magic trick\\" involves pulling a loaded tablecloth away from a table but leaving the plates behind.

The archetypal unfinished symphony is Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (sometimes called Schubert's Unfinished Symphony), written in 1822, six years before his death. It features two fully orchestrated movements. While it seems clear from sketches that Schubert set out to create a traditional four- movement symphony, this has been the subject of endless debate. Schubert wrote the symphony for the Graz Musical Society, and gave the manuscript to his friend Anselm H√ºttenbrenner, in his capacity as its representative. However, H√ºttenbrenner did not show the score to the society at that time, nor did he reveal the existence of the manuscript after Schubert died in 1828, but kept it a secret for another 37 years. In 1865, when he was 76 (three years before his death), H√ºttenbrenner finally showed it to the conductor Johann von Herbeck, who conducted the extant two movements on 17 December 1865 in Vienna, adding the last movement of Schubert's third symphony as the finale. Music historians and scholars then toiled to \\"prove\\" the composition was complete in its two-movement form, and indeed, in that form it became one of the most popular pieces in the late 19th century classical music repertoire, and remains one of Schubert's most popular compositions. Other unfinished symphonies The unfinished symphony may also refer to: *Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 10, a hypothetical work assembled by Barry Cooper from fragmentary sketches left by Beethoven. *Georges Bizet's Roma Symphony, sometimes described as \\"unfinished\\", but this is misleading. After eleven years of tinkering (1860‚Äì1871), with a partial performance in 1869, Bizet could still not produce a version that truly satisfied him. However, the latest version of the symphony was published posthumously in 1880, and is a complete work in the sense that all the movements are fully scored. *Alexander Borodin's Symphony No. 3, which only contains two drafted movements, and was later completed for publication by Alexander Glazunov. *Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 9, which only contains three complete movements and a draft of the fourth movement. There have been a number of completions made of the fourth movement, but most conductors opt to perform and record only the first three. *Boudewijn Buckinx's symphonies. In the years 1991‚Äì1992 this postmodern Belgian composer composed nine unfinished symphonies (which premiered in 1993).Boudewijn Buckinx: composers website ‚Äì list of compositions *Norbert Burgm√ºller Symphony No. 2, which only contains two complete movements. The third movement, a scherzo, was finished and orchestrated by Robert Schumann. *Edward Elgar's Symphony No. 3 in C minor, op. 88 (1932‚Äì34), which Elgar left with a mass of sketches for the four movements of this potentially major work, with a few passages fully scored. A highly creative performing version was achieved in 1997 by Anthony Payne. *Charles Ives's Universe Symphony, a composition which Ives worked on periodically between 1911 and 1928. During the 1980s and 1990s, there were three separate performing versions assembled, including a version by David Gray Porter (1993), Larry Austin (1994), and Johnny Reinhard (1996). *Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 10, which Mahler left with a continuous draft of this five-movement work, with the first and third movements more or less fully scored. These two movements (Adagio and Purgatorio) were prepared for publication by Franz Schalk and Ernst Krenek in 1924. Various orchestrations and performing editions of the entire symphony have been made since the 1960s, including that of Deryck Cooke (1960‚Äì64), subsequently revised with input from Berthold Goldschmidt, Colin Matthews and David Matthews and a sparer, brass-prominent version by Joseph Wheeler. *Carl Nielsen's Symphony in F major (1888), which only contains the completed first movement, which later got the title Symphonic Rhapsody FS 7. It was performed twice, but Nielsen never composed the rest of it. Instead he started composing what would become his first symphony in G minor, which is famous for being the first symphony in history that changes key and ends in C major. *Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 7, which only contains a completed first movement and a single instrument part for the remaining symphony. Completions were made by John Francis Barnett, Felix Weingartner and Brian Newbould, among others. *Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 10, a symphonic sketch from 1828 reconstructed as a three-movement work often referred to as his Tenth or Last symphony. (Scholars believe it is the work meant by a reference to the 'Last Symphony' (Letzte Symphonie) in a contemporary obituary of Schubert.) *Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8, which was announced during his life several times, but was probably destroyed by the composer. *Wilhelm Stenhammar's Symphony No. 3, which contains a draft of a first movement (including a seven-page fragment in full score) and sketches of three other movements. The full-score fragment of the first movement was edited with a concert ending by Tommy B. Andersson and first performed in 1991. *Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 7, which Tchaikovsky abandoned; he reused the sketches for his third piano concerto and Andante and Finale. Semyon Bogatyrev produced the symphony version, now sometimes called \\"Symphony No.7\\". *Eduard Tubin's Symphony No. 11, which contains a partially orchestrated first movement and the opening ten bars of a second movement. The orchestration of the first movement was completed by Kaljo Raid in 1987 and this movement has been performed and recorded several times. *Ernest John Moeran's Symphony No. 2 in E flat major, which Moeran left with advanced sketches for the four movements at the time of his death, in 1950. The manuscript of that work and various others were donated by his widow Peers Coetmore to the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. Conductor Martin Yates has recently realised and completed the Symphony No. 2 from sketches and the recording of the work with Yates conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra was released on the Dutton Epoch label (together with the early Overture and also with Martin Yates' own orchestration of Sarnia by John Ireland in October 2011). *Richard Arnell's Symphony No. 7 \\"Mandela\\", op. 201.

It is located in the Sulu Archipelago, between Borneo and Mindanao, and has a population of approximately 500,000 people. The island is the location of the Jolo Group of Volcanoes, and contains numerous volcanic cones and craters, including the active Bud Dajo cinder cone. The island is also the headquarters of Abu Sayyaf terrorists. History Location within Sulu province After a series of less-than-successful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces captured the city of Jolo, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876. On that year, the Spanish launched a massive campaign to occupy Jolo. Spurred by the need to curb slave raiding once and for all and worried about the presence of other Western powers in the south (the British had established trading centers in Jolo by the 19th century and the French were offering to purchase Basilan Island from the cash strapped government in Madrid, Spain), the Spanish made a final bid to consolidate their rule in this southern frontier. On 21 February of that year, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent against Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers, in 11 transports, 11 gunboats, and 11 steamboats. Headed by Admiral Jose Malcampo, the contingent captured Jolo and established a Spanish settlement with Capt. Pascual Cervera appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor; he served from March 1876 to December 1876 followed by Brig. Gen. Jose Paulin (December 1876 ‚Äì April 1877), Col. Carlos Martinez (Sept 1877 ‚Äì Feb 1880), Col. Rafael de Rivera (1880‚Äì1881), Col. Isidro G. Soto (1881‚Äì1882), Col. Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Col. Julian Parrado (1882‚Äì1884), Col. Francisco Castilla (1884‚Äì1886), Col. Juan Arolas (1886‚Äì1893), Col. Caesar Mattos (1893), Gen. Venancio Hernandez (1893‚Äì1896) and Col. Luis Huerta (1896‚Äì1899). French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visiting the Sultan of Jolo By 1878 the Spaniards had fortified Jolo with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta Espa√±a, and Puerta Alfonso XII; and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina. Troops, including a cavalry with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective confine of the walls. From Jolo, in 1880 Col. Rafael Gonzales de Rivera who was appointed the governor dispatched the 6th Regiment to Siasi and Bongao islands. The Spaniards were not secure in their stronghold because it would be sporadically attacked. On 22 July 1883, it is reported that three unnamed juramentado succeeded in penetrating the Jolo town plaza and killed three Spaniards.; The word \\"Ajuramentado\\" was coined by Spanish colonel Juan Arolas after witnessing several such acts while serving duty in Jolo garrison. The Spanish and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878.Spanish text of treaty can be viewed in Coleccion de los tratados, convenios y documentos internationales, text also published in the Gaceta de Manila, A√±o XVlll, Tomo II, numero 0052 (August 21, 1878) The Americans arrived in 1899, and by the turn of the century, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War was raging in Luzon. So as not to spread out their forces, the Americans employed the classic divide-and-rule tactic. The four- day Battle of Bud Bagsak in 1913 Initially, Sultan Kiram was disappointed by the hand-over of control to the Americans and had expected to regain sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago after the defeat of the Spanish. Brig. General John C. Bates's main goal though, was to guarantee the Sultanate's neutrality in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and to establish order in Mindanao. After some negotiations, the Bates Treaty was signed. This treaty was based on the earlier Spanish treaty, and it retained the translation discrepancy: the English version described a complete dependency, while the Tausug version described a protectorate. Although the Bates Treaty granted more powers to the Americans than the original Spanish treaty, the treaty was still criticized in America for granting too much autonomy to the Sultan. One particular clause, which recognized the Moro practice of slavery, also raised eyebrows in Washington, D.C. Bates later admitted that the treaty was merely a stop-gap measure, signed only to buy time until the war in the north was ended and more forces could be brought to bear in the south. The peace created by the Bates Treaty did not last, however. This became evident when the Muslims repudiated the Moro province, a politico-military government in Mindanao lasting from 1903 to 1914, and the Moro Rebellion soon broke out. It is important to note that barely two months before the creation of the Moro province, the American colonial government declared and classified all unoccupied lands as public lands. Immediately after the declaration, American investments entered Mindanao and mass migration of Christians was encouraged.Rodil 1985:4. Severina Luna de Orosa and her husband Sixto Orosa were the first Christian doctors to work in Jolo, bringing western medicine to the region. Tulay Central Mosque in Jolo Jolo was occupied by the Japanese during World War II. On April 2, 1945, the 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 163rd Regiment, 41st Division (formerly the Montana National Guard) landed at Sanga Sanga and Bongao in the Sulu Archipelago, halfway between the island of Borneo and the Philippines. A week later, the other two battalions of the regiment left Mindanao and landed at Jolo, where they began fighting their way up heavily defended Mount Daho, the highest point on the island. The Sultan of Jolo, Muhammad Janail Abirin the 2nd, leader of the archipelago's 300,000 Moslems, welcomed Col. William J. Moroney, commander of the 163rd, and promised to help rid the island of Japanese. In three weeks of combat the 163rd suffered 37 dead and 191 wounded. Approximately 2,600 Japanese troops were killed, and only 87 Japanese soldiers were captured or surrendered in Jolo. Local fighters killed many Japanese stragglers hiding in the jungle after the Imperial Army surrendered in August, 1945.Glynn, Gary. Montana's Home Front During World War II, 2nd ed. Big Elk Books. 2012. Fighting on the island flared up again in February 2005 when between 4,000 and 5,000 Philippine troops clashed with around 800 Islamist militants from the Abu Sayyaf group, along with followers of Nur Misuari. Up to 12,000 people were thought to have fled the fighting. Fighting is still continuing today. On 27 January 2019 the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Jolo was bombed.  Kidnappings  On 22 September 2015, Kjartan Sekkingstad, age 56, from Sotra, Norway, was abducted by Abu Sayyaf Islamist guerrillas from a high-end tourist resort on Samal Island, along with 2 Canadian men, John Ridsdel, age 68, and Robert Hall, age 67, and a Filipina woman, Marites Flor, Hall‚Äôs girlfriend. In April and June 2016, the Canadians were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, and in June 2016 Flor was released. On 17 September 2016, Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island, about 600 miles south of Manila, after Islamist captor Aby Sayyaf received $638,000 in ransom for his release. He was handed over to the rebel group Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The MNLF is in peace talks with the government and had been working with authorities to secure his release. It is not known who has paid the ransom, but it is not Norwegian authorities.

According to the , it has a population of people. History=Pre-Colonial period In the 14th century, Arab traders landed on the island to introduce and convert its inhabitants to Islam. The native inhabitants on the island are the Taus≈´g people. The Tausugs are part of the larger Moro group which dominates the Sulu Archipelago. The Moro had an independent state known as the Sultanate of Sulu, which was politically and economically centered on Jolo, the residence for Sulu Sultanates. The Seat of the Royal Sultanate of Sulu was in Astana Putih, which is Tausug for ‚ÄòWhite Palace‚Äô in Umbul Duwa in the municipality of Indanan on Jolo Island, later on, the capital was moved in Maimbung during the 1800s. Spanish Colonial Period The Spanish failed to conquer and convert the Muslim areas in Mindanao. After colonising the islands in the north, they failed to take over the well-organized sultanates in the south. =Trading center= The Sulu economy relied on the network of nearby trading partners. The Sultanate benefited from importing rice from northern Philippines, as the Sulu region had a chronic rice shortage. The Sultanate was unable to bring agriculture to its full potential because the area was prone to erratic rainfall and drought. =Chinese immigration= Since the 15th century, the Sulu Sultanate traded local produce with neighbors and with countries as far as China by sea. Most of the import and export trade was done with Singapore which was estimated to be worth half a million dollars annually. In 1870, the Tausug lost much of their redistributive trade to the Chinese because of the Spanish cruising system and Chinese immigration from Singapore. Mostly originating from the Fujian province, most of the Chinese in Jolo worked as craftsmen, skilled and unskilled laborers and domestic servants for wealthy Tausugs and Chinese. Singapore served as a training ground from which they learned the Malay language and became experienced in dealing with Southeast Asians. It was these Chinese who eventually dominated trade in Jolo and benefited greatly from Jolo's status as an entrepot, and exercised profound influence over the Sulu Sultanate. However, the Sultanate was not keen on the Chinese monopoly. By 1875, Sultan Jamal ul-Azam wanted an English merchant to establish himself in order to break the monopoly at Jolo. Chinese who lived in Sulu ran guns across a Spanish blockade to supply the Moro Datus and Sultanates with weapons to fight the Spanish, who were engaging in a campaign to subjugate the Moro sultantes on Mindanao. A trade involving the Moros selling slaves and other goods in exchange for guns developed. The Chinese had entered the economy of the sultante, taking control of nearly the entire Sultanate's economy in Mindanao and dominating the markets. Though the Sultans did not like their economic monopoly, they did business with them. The Chinese set up a trading network between Singapore, Zamboanga, Jolo and Sulu. The Chinese sold small arms like Enfield and Spencer rifles to the Buayan Datu Uto. They were used to battle the Spanish invasion of Buayan. The Datu paid for the weapons in slaves. The population of Chinese in Mindanao in the 1880s was 1,000. The Chinese ran guns across a Spanish blockade to sell to Mindanao Moros. The purchases of these weapons were paid for by the Moros in slaves in addition to other goods. The main group of people selling guns were the Chinese in Sulu. The Chinese took control of the economy and used steamers to ship goods for exporting and importing. Opium, ivory, textiles, and crockery were among the other goods which the Chinese sold. The Chinese on Maimbung sent the weapons to the Sulu Sultanate, who used them to battle the Spanish and resist their attacks. A Chinese-Mestizo was one of the Sultan's brothers- in-law, the Sultan was married to his sister. He and the Sultan both owned shares in the ship (named the Far East) which helped smuggled the weapons. The Spanish launched a surprise offensive under Colonel Juan Arolas in April 1887 by attacking the Sultanate's capital at Maimbung in an effort to crush resistance. Weapons were captured and the property of the Chinese was destroyed and the Chinese were deported to Jolo. =Spanish control= In 1876, the Spanish attempted to gain control of the Muslims by burning Jolo and were successful.Ang, Josiah C. \\"Historical Timeline of the Royal Sultanate of Sulu Including Related Events of Neighboring Peoples\\". Center for Southeast Asian Studies Northern Illinois University. In March 1877, The Sulu Protocol was signed between Spain, England and Germany which recognized Spain's rights over Sulu and eased European tensions in the area. The Spanish built the smallest walled city in the world in Jolo. =Trading decline= Trade suffered heavily in 1892 when three steamers used for trade were lost in a series of storms on the trade route between Singapore and Jolo. The traders in Singapore lost so heavily as a result that they refused to accept trade unless it was paid for in cash. Along with the fear of increased taxation, many Chinese left to other parts of the Archipelago as Jolo lost its role as the regional entrepot. The Tausug had already abandoned trading when the Chinese arrived. Thus, Jolo never fully gained its previous trading status. However, the Chinese continued to dominate trade throughout the Archipelago and Mindanao. Gates of Jolo, circa 1899 American Colonial Period In 1899 following the Treaty of Paris of 1898, sovereignty over the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States who attempted to forcibly incorporate the Muslim areas into the Philippine state. The American colonizers eventually took over the southern regions with force (see Moro Rebellion). The Sultanate of Sulu was abolished in 1936. Geography The town of Jolo is located on the north-west side of the Jolo Island, which is located south-west of the tip of Zamboanga Peninsula on Mindanao island. The island is situated between the provinces of Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, bounded by Sulu Sea to the north and Celebes Sea to the south. Jolo is a volcanic island, which lies at the center of the Sulu Archipelago covering . The Sulu Archipelago is an island chain in the Southwest Philippines between Mindanao and Borneo, which is made up of 900 islands of volcanic and coral origin covering an area of . There are numerous volcanoes and craters around Jolo with the last known activity (an earthquake assumed resulting from a submarine eruption from an undetermined location) taking place on September 21, 1897 causing devastating tsunamis in the archipelago and western Mindanao.\\"Eruption history of Jolo\\". Global Volcanism Program.U.S. Bureau of Census. \\"Census of the Philippine Islands, 1903\\", pp.217‚Äì218. Government Printing Office, 1905. Barangays Jolo is politically subdivided into eight barangays. * Alat * Asturias * Bus-Bus * Takut Takut * Tulay * San Ray Mundo * Chinese Pier * Walled City Climate=Demographics=Languages The majority of people who live in Jolo speak Tausug. English is also used, especially in schools and different offices. Hokkien and Malay are also spoken by some traders. Other languages include Sama and Yakan. According to the 2000 Philippine census by the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Tausug language ranks number 14 with 1,022,000 speakers all over the country, the speakers mainly in the Western Mindanao area to which Sulu belongs. Religion Tulay Central Mosque, the largest mosque in Sulu About 99% of the people living in Jolo practice Islam, but there is also a significant Christian minority consisting of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Tausugs were the first Filipinos to adopt Islam when the Muslim missionary Karim ul-Makhdum came to Sulu in 1380. Other missionaries included Rajah Baguinda and the Muslim Arabian scholar Sayid Abu Bakr, who became the first Sultan of Sulu. The family and community relations are based on their understanding of Islamic law. The Tausug are also heavily influenced by their pre-Islamic traditions. Tulay Central Mosque is the largest mosque in town and in the province. There are also numerous mosques located in different areas and barangays around Jolo. Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in the town center and is the biggest church in town. \\"Jolo Alliance Evangelical Church\\" (formerly known as Jolo Evangelical Church) of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Churches of the Philippines (CAMACOP) also co-exist along with the Catholic Church since the 1900s, making it the first Protestant church in the archipelago. Culture Tausug woman in traditional garb, performing the Pangalay Bangsamoro or Moroland is the homeland of the Moro, which is a Spanish term used for Muslims. The majority of Jolo's people are Tausugs ‚Äì the ethnic group that dominates the Sulu Archipelago. Tausug derives from the words tau meaning ‚Äúman‚Äù and sug meaning ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù, which translates to ‚Äú people of the current‚Äù, because they were known to be seafarers with military and merchant skills. The Tausugs are known as the warrior tribe with excellent fighting skills.\\"People, Culture and the Arts\\" . Province of Sulu Official Web Site. Before the Tausugs adopted Islam, the Tausugs were organized into kauman and were governed by a patriarchal form of government with the individual datus as heads of their own communities. The source of law was the Adat which the Tausugs followed strictly.Kamlian, Jamail A.. \\"Islam, Women and Gender Justice: A Discourse on the Traditional Islamic Practices among the Tausug in Southern Philippines\\" . Emory University School of Law, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. The Tausug arts and handicrafts have a mix of Islamic and Indonesian influences. Pangalay is a popular celebratory dance at Tausug weddings, which can last weeks depending on the financial status and agreement of the families. They dance to the music of kulintangan, gabbang, and agong. Another traditional dance of courtship is the Pangalay ha Agong. In this dance, two Tausug warriors compete for the attention of a woman using an agong (large, deep, brass gong) to demonstrate their competence and skill. A large portion of the population in Jolo is of Chinese descent. Between 1770 and 1800, 18,000 Chinese came from South China to trade and many of them stayed. In 1803, Portuguese Captain Juan Carvalho reported that there were 1,200 Chinese living in the town. The reorientation of the Sulu trade patterns caused an influx of Chinese immigrants from Singapore.James Francis Warren, \\"The Sulu Zone, 1768‚Äì1898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State\\". National University of Singapore Press, Singapore. Economy=Industry In Jolo, most of the residents are in the agriculture industry. Agricultural products include coconut, cassava, abaca, coffee, lanzones, jackfruit, durian, mangosteen and marang. Jolo is the only municipality in Sulu that does not farm seaweed. Fishing is the most important industry; otherwise people engage in the industries of boat building, mat weaving, coffee processing, and fruit preservation.\\"Tourism\\" . Province of Sulu Official Web Site. Banking There were different banks operating in Jolo and serving the people of Jolo for their needs. These included the Philippine National Bank, Metrobank, Allied Bank, Al-Amanah Islamic Bank, Land Bank and Development Bank of the Philippines. Automated teller machines (ATMs) are also available in selected bank branches. Economic growth USNS Mercy in the background. Economic development in Jolo has been hampered by instability, violence and unrest caused by the presence of several Islamist separatist groups in the Bangsamoro. The long-running separatist insurgency has made these Muslim- dominated islands some of the poorest regions in the nation. Jolo has faced a large degree of lawlessness and poverty.Crossette, Barbara (1987-09-11). \\"In Filipino Port, Lawlessness Grows\\". New York Times. Jolo is a main stronghold for the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf group, and these conditions are ideal for militant recruitment. However, the situation has improved since the US has invested in developing the region. In 2007, United States Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Karen Hughes and US Ambassador Kristie Kenney visited Jolo to learn about US government-sponsored projects for ‚Äòdevelopment, peace and prosperity‚Äô in the region. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has funded a ‚Äòfarm-to-market‚Äô road between Maimbung and Jolo to help farmers transport agricultural produce to the market. On her visit, Kenney announced the $3 million plan to improve the Jolo Airport.http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb;=21_T5667574747&format;=GNBFI&sort;=DATE,A,H&startDocNo;=1&resultsUrlKey;=29_T5666963374&cisb;=22_T5667573664&treeMax;=true&treeWidth;=0&csi;=173384&docNo;=2 Since 1997, USAID has spent $4 million a year in the region.http://www.sulu.gov.ph/latestinsulu.asp?id=37&hide;_id=5&tabid;=1&scode;#t2WKj77QX60XM5ALuh8R=jeDXxt0Fn60Lc5FSq11YycJfnr2MDo Other institutions involved are the World Bank, JICA and AusAID.

Local Water Utilities Administration. Peace and order=Clan feud In present-day Sulu, there is a degree of lawlessness and clan-based politics. These clan lines are based along family ties, which started after Arthur Amaral proposed marriage to a woman from a rival clan. The rejected proposal caused a family feud which forced families to take sides. There are 100,000 rifles circling the Sulu archipelago. Almost every household owns a gun, and the clans often settle disputes with violence. Most of the disputes between clans revolve around land. The clan-based society makes it extremely difficult for police to impose law. There are several gun shootings and the Filipino Army is often called in to settle disputes.AlJazeeraEnglish (2008-07-29). \\"People and Power - Gun culture - 29 July 08 Part 1\\". YouTube. In April 2008, the Jolo Zone of Peace, which was supported by the Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (CHD), was established where firearms were restricted in mediating conflicts between clans. The Sulu government is attempting to spread this zone of peace into the countryside.AlJazeeraEnglish (2008-07-29). \\"People and Power - Gun culture - 29 July 08 Part 2\\". YouTube. Abu Sayyaf The island was considered dangerous for foreigners, especially Americans, as militants threatened to shoot or abduct them on the spot. Much of the anger comes from when American colonizers killed 1000 men, women and children, who had retreated up Mount Dajo in 1906 after refusing to pay taxes, in the First Battle of Bud Dajo during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War.http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb;=21_T5667574747&format;=GNBFI&sort;=DATE,A,H&startDocNo;=1&resultsUrlKey;=29_T5666963374&cisb;=22_T5667573664&treeMax;=true&treeWidth;=0&csi;=11314&docNo;=3 However, the American image has improved since American development plans for the region were carried out. The most radical separatist Islamic group Abu Sayyaf claims to be fighting for an Islamic state independent of the Roman Catholic Philippine government. The group has strongholds in Jolo and Basilan. Driven by poverty and high rewards, a significant number of local residents are suspected to work for them. The Abu Sayyaf has committed a series of kidnappings. On April 23, 2000, the Abu Sayyaf raided the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan and kidnapped 21 tourists from Germany, France, Finland and South Africa and brought them back to Jolo, asking for $25 million in ransom money. The Abu Sayyaf has also kidnapped several journalists and photographers in Jolo. The US has already spent millions of dollars for information leading to the arrest of militants; and offered up to $5 million in bounty with Manila as much as P10 million reward for information leading to the capture of Abu Sayyaf leaders. Sulu governor Benjamin Loong supported the US Special Forces projects ‚ÄúOperation Smiles‚Äù of providing medical care, and building roads and schools. The US Special Forces and Governor Loong hopes that winning respect and alleviating poverty from the people will stop terrorist recruitment. Governor Loong claimed that many residents have turned away Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah members. War on Terror The damage of the cathedral on January 28, 2019. Three months after the September 11 attacks, George W. Bush announced the US was opening a second front in the War on Terror in the Philippines. The Archipelago became the testing grounds for the Philippine anti-terror plan ‚ÄúClear, Hold and Develop‚Äù. In August 2006, Operation Ultimatum was launched and 5,000 Philippine marines and soldiers, supported by the US Special Forces began clearing the island of Jolo, fighting against a force of 400 guerillas. By February 2007, the town of Jolo was deemed cleared of terrorists.  2019 cathedral bombings  On 27 January 2019, two bombings took place at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The bombings led by an unknown bandit but not exactly group Abu Sayyaf were widely condemned by local people in Jolo, The bombing caused at least few people killed or wounded during that day.  2020 town plaza bombings  On 24 August 2020, at around 12:00 pm, a bomb exploded in front of the Paradise Food Plaza in Barangay Walled City. At least five civilians and four soldiers were killed, while several others were wounded. A second bomb exploded at around 1:00 pm near the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which was the same site of two bombings last year. One civilian was killed while two others were injured. Philippine Red Cross Chief Richard Gordon said that a motorcycle loaded with an improvised explosive device exploded near a military truck. Political and societal significance The Moros are geographically concentrated in the Southwest of the Philippines. Moros identify mostly with the majority Muslim nations of Indonesia and Malaysia because of their geographic proximity, and linguistic and cultural similarities. Moros have faced encroachments from the Spanish, Americans and now face the national Philippine government. Thus, the struggle for the Moro independent state has existed for over 400 years. Jolo has been the center of this conflict. Between 1972 and 1976, Jolo was the center of the Muslim Separatist Rebellion between the Muslim militants and the Marcos regime which killed 120,000 people. In 1974, fighting broke out when the government troops stopped the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) from taking over the town.Garrido, Marco C. (2005-01-20). \\"Tribulation Islands, Part 2\\". Asia Times. Currently, the Moro National Liberation Front is the ruling party of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). In 1996, the MNLF was granted leadership of the ARMM in response to the calls for Muslim autonomy. Abdusakur Tan is the governor of Sulu and Husin Amin is the mayor of Jolo. Politicians in these regions rose to power with the help of clan connections.

He printed the Journals of the House of Commons from 1774 until his death. His son Thomas Curson Hansard took over the business, and added the name \\"Hansard\\" to the title of the official reports of parliamentary debates and proceedings in 1829. This led to such reports in the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries being customarily known as Hansard. Early life and education Born in St Mary's Parish, Norwich, Hansard was the son of a Norwich manufacturer. He was educated at Kirton Grammar School in Kirton, Lincolnshire,George S. Bagley (1986). Boston Its Story and People. The History of Boston Project. . and was apprenticed to Stephen White, a Norwich printer. Career As soon as Hansard's apprenticeship expired, he started for London with only a guinea in his pocket, and became a compositor in the office of John Hughs (1703‚Äì1771), printer to the British House of Commons. In 1774 he was made a partner, and undertook almost the entire conduct of the business, which in 1800 came completely into his hands. On the admission of his sons the firm became Luke Hansard & Sons, based on Parker Street, off Drury Lane. Among those whose friendship Hansard won in the exercise of his profession were Edmund Burke, Samuel Johnson and Robert Orme, while Richard Porson praised him as the most accurate printer of Greek. Harriet Martineau wrote: Parliamentary records Hansard printed the Journals of the House of Commons from 1774 till his death. The promptitude and accuracy with which he printed parliamentary papers were often of the greatest service to government‚Äîon one occasion the proof-sheets of the report of the Secret Committee on the French Revolution were submitted to Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger 24 hours after the draft had left Pitt's hands. On the union between Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, the increase of parliamentary printing compelled Hansard to give up all private printing except when Parliament was not sitting. He devised numerous expedients for reducing the expense of publishing the reports; and in 1805, when his workmen went on strike at a time of great pressure, he and his sons themselves set to work as compositors. Hansard's company became the Hansard Publishing Union. From 1809 the company, then run by his son Thomas Curson Hansard, printed the official reports of debates and proceedings in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and owned the publication from 1812. In 1829 T. C. Hansard added the family's name to the title of the reports, which led to such reports in the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries becoming known as Hansard.

In the same year, William Cobbett, a newspaperman, began to print the Parliamentary Debates. At first, these were not independent reports, but were taken from newspapers' accounts of parliamentary debate. In 1809, Hansard started to print Cobbett's reports. Together, they also published a pamphlet describing an incident in which German mercenaries had flogged British soldiers for mutiny; as a result Hansard was imprisoned on 9 July 1810 in King's Bench Prison for libel. In 1812, facing bankruptcy, Cobbett sold the publication to Hansard, who continued to publish it for the rest of his life. In 1829, he added his own name to the parliamentary proceedings, giving it the title Hansard that it bears to this day.

After moving to Belgrade, at the age of 30 he began his music studies as the only student of the composer Petar Bingulac. (He himself was a student of the French composer Vincent d'Indy.) Years later (1953), he took composition lessons with the Viennese composer Alfred Uhl, at the Vienna Music Academy . A crucial moment in his work was winning first prize at the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition for composers in Brussels in 1965 with his symphony Lesta. This prize was won in competition with 250 other composers from 26 countries. In the 1970s Brucci did a lot to improve Academy of Arts in Novi Sad, where he was the first dean, an Academy with best Music Department in ex-Yugoslavia.

Typically, rich pictures follow no commonly agreed syntax, usually consist of symbols, sketches or \\"doodles\\" and can contain as much (pictorial) information as is deemed necessary. The finished picture may be of value to other stakeholders of the problem being described since it is likely to capture many different facets of the situation, but the real value of this technique is the way it forces the creator to think deeply about the problem and understand it well enough to express it pictorially (a process known as action learning). Rich pictures are a diagrammatic way of relating your own experiences and perceptions to a given problem situation through the identification and linking of a series of concepts. The creation of a rich picture provides a forum in which to think about a given situation. Rich pictures should concentrate on both the structure and the processes of a given situation. Rich pictures are a part of the understanding process, not just a way of recording what you know of a given situation or creating a work of art. The use of metaphor in rich pictures means that their interpretation by others can often be difficult. This is of little consequence as it is the personal learning aspects that are important to this method. It is also possible to produce rich pictures as part of a group. By having everybody contribute to a rich picture they can be used to help develop a shared understanding of a given situation. Mind maps are often considered to be rich pictures, but since these tend to be mainly text-based and do dictate a degree of formality with respect to their structure, clear distinctions can be drawn. Generally, the two notations serve different purposes (for example, in the field of systems engineering).

Biography The scientist Samuel Haughton was born in Carlow, the son of another Samuel Haughton (1786-1874) and grandson (by his second wife Jane Boake) of the three-times-married Samuel Pearson Haughton (1748-1828), a Quaker. Samuel Pearson Haughton was also father, by his third wife Mary Pim, of James \\"Vegetable\\" Haughton (1795‚Äì1873), a Unitarian, an active philanthropist, a strong supporter of Father Theobald Mathew, a vegetarian, and an anti-slavery worker and writer. The scientist Samuel Haughton had a distinguished career in Trinity College, Dublin and in 1844 he was elected a fellow. Working on mathematical models under James MacCullagh, he was awarded in 1848 the Cunningham Medal by the Royal Irish Academy. In 1847 he had his ordination to the priesthood but he was not someone who preached. He was appointed as professor of geology in Trinity College in 1851. He held the position for thirty years. Haughton began to study medicine in 1859. He earned his MD degree in 1862 from the University of Dublin. Haughton became registrar of the Medical School. He focused on improving the status of the school and representing the university on the General Medical Council from 1878 to 1896. In 1858 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society,. He gained honorary degrees from Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh. In Trinity College Dublin he moved the first-ever motion at the Academic Council to admit women to the University on 10 March 1880. He proposed that 'In the opinion of the Council, the time has come when the Degrees in Arts of the University should be opened to women, by examination, on the same terms as men' (Thomson, 2004). Haughton, through his work as Professor of Geology, and his involvement with the Royal Zoological Society had witnessed the enthusiasm and contribution of women in the natural sciences. Although thwarted by opponents on the Council he continued to campaign for the admission of women to TCD until his death in 1897. It was 1902 before his motion was finally passed, 5 years after his death. In 1866, Haughton developed the original equations for hanging as a humane method of execution, whereby the neck was broken at the time of the drop, so that the condemned person did not slowly strangle to death. \\"On hanging considered from a Mechanical and Physiological point of view\\" was published in the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, Vol. 32 No. 213 (July 1866), calling for a drop energy of 2,240 ft-lbs. From 1886 to 1888, he served as a member of the Capital Sentences Committee, the report of which suggested a Table of Drops based on 1,260 ft-lbs of energy. Haughton wrote papers on many subjects for journals in London and Dublin. His topics included the laws of equilibrium, the motion of solid and fluid bodies, sun-heat, radiation, climates and tides. His papers covered the granites of Leinster and Donegal and the cleavage and joint-planes of the Old Red Sandstone of Waterford. Haughton was president of the Royal Irish Academy from 1886 to 1891, and secretary of the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland for twenty years. In 1880 he gave the Croonian Lecture on animal mechanics to the Royal Society. Samuel Haughton was also involved in the Dublin and Kingstown Railway company, in which he looked after the building of the first locomotives. It was the first railway company in the world to build its own locomotives.Quakers history, Monkstown Quakers and the Railways Criticism of Darwin \\"Haughton has the dubious honour of being the first person to comment on Darwin's theory when the joint papers of Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were read to the Linnaean Society of London in 1858. They were presented by Darwin's close allies, the geologist Charles Lyell and the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker. Haughton presumably saw the printed version of the papers and attacked the theory briefly in remarks made to the Geological Society of Dublin on 9 February 1859. These were reported in the society's journal, and a clipping of this found its way into Darwin's possession. Haughton wrote: > This speculation of Mess. Darwin and Wallace would not be worthy of note > were it not for the weight of authority of the names under whose auspices it > has been brought forward. If it means what it says, it is a truism; if it > means anything more, it is contrary to fact. Darwin later commented in his autobiography that this was the only response to the papers, summarising Haughton‚Äôs verdict as ‚Äòall that [was] new in there was false, and what was true was old'.\\"Charles Darwin and his Dublin critics: Samuel Haughton and William Henry Harvey, by Peter J. Bowler In an anonymous article written in 1860 in the Natural History Review Haughton set out his opinion that Darwin's theory was founded almost entirely upon speculation but also that this speculative theory belonged originally to Lamarck and that the differences between the two men's work was negligible. > to establish a character for subtlety and skill, in drawing large > conclusions on this subject from slender premises, the first requisite is, > ignorance of what other speculators have attempted before us in the same > field: and the second is, a firm confidence in our own special theory. > Neither of these requisites can be considered wanting in those who are > engaged in the task of reproducing Lamarck‚Äôs theory of organic life, either > as altogether new, or with but a tattered threadbare cloak, thrown over its > original nakedness.Natural History Review, ii (Dublin, 1860) p.23. Theistic evolution Haughton's work on animal mechanics led him to believe that the structure of species was designed by an intelligent creator. In his book Animal Mechanics (1873, page 238) he commented that the \\"Framer of the Universe\\" had designed all muscles so they could perform the maximum work possible under given external conditions.Bowler, Peter J. (2009). In Retrospect: Charles Darwin and his Dublin critics: Samuel Haughton and William Henry Harvey. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature 109C: 409-420. In the preface to his book he was open to the possibility of \\"teleological evolution\\". Evolution was governed by a \\"Divine mind\\" and nothing was left to chance. Publications *Manual of Geology (1865) *Principles of Animal Mechanics (1873)Trotter, C. (1873).

The idea is to ease conflicts of interest and agency costs between the holders of the initial components, bond and stockholders. In deals that are strip financed, returns to investors are generally derived from their equity positions (seen through how investors from time to time take losses on the debt components of the strip). Therefore, in a situation where a company is acquired through a strip- financed deal, and that company begins to default on loans, investors are more willing to renegotiate lending terms, thus avoiding the hold-up problem often seen in prior to and during bankruptcy. Also, repackaging can raise a securities' liquidity. One popular form developed in Canada was the Income Trust, which combined income from a high yield bond with a stock dividend. Beginning in 2003 this concept was expanded to the U.S. when \\"Income Deposit Securities\\" (also known as Enhanced Income Securities) were first offered on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). These consist of a high yield bond and a class of common stock committed to pay a high dividend from free cash flows combined as a single unit.

During their performance, the 6th string snapped and severed the tip of David Cluney's 5th finger, making it stiff.

He was born in Hamilton, Ontario with roots in Nova Scotia. He began his professional career working with his brother, folk musician Stan Rogers, and arranging Stan's music. Career Despite and ever since Stan Rogers' death on June 2, 1983 (just a few weeks before Stan, Garnet and bass player Jim Morison were to tour America), Garnet Rogers has pursued his own career. At first, Garnet had difficulty getting a permit from the U.S. Immigration Service, which only granted one after a campaign on his behalf was launched by Odetta, The Boston Globe, and a PBS TV station in New York. While his brother's style of writing was more traditional and often based on Canadian Maritime styles, Garnet's style is more modern, utilizing influences from blues, rock, country/bluegrass, and classical. Rogers' instruments include the guitar, mandolin, violin, and flute. In live performances, he usually sits beside a guitar rack that includes three vintage Gibson acoustic guitars, a National guitar, a Fender Stratocaster, and sometimes a Hammertone Octave 12 (half-scale electric 12-string guitar). His songs include The Outside Track, All That Is, Sleeping Buffalo, Night Drive, Under The Summer Moonlight, Summer Lightning, Small Victory, and Frankie and Johnny. They range from slices of life to mild social commentary and humour. His humour is also seen in his on-stage banter between songs, mostly unrecorded, except for a couple of interludes on his brother's posthumous album, \\"Home in Halifax\\". In addition, Garnet has covered other folk artists' work, including Roy Forbes' (Bim's) Woh Me, and Archie Fisher's The Final Trawl. His collaborators include Doug McArthur and Doug Long. Garnet has also written \\"Night Drive\\" a memoir of his travels with his brother Stan Rogers, who died in a fire aboard an Air Canada Flight in 1983. Personal life Garnet lives on a farm in Brantford, Ontario, where his wife Gail raises champion thoroughbreds. They also own a house in Nova Scotia.

An all-rounder, he captained Australia in ten Test matches between 1920 and 1921, and was undefeated, winning eight Tests and drawing two. Armstrong was captain of the 1920‚Äì21 Australian team which defeated the touring English 5‚Äì0: one of only three teams to win an Ashes series in a whitewash. In a Test career interrupted by the First World War, he scored 2,863 runs at an average of 38.68, including six centuries, and took 87 wickets. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000. Armstrong was a large man (6 foot 3 inches ‚Äì 1.9 m tall and 21 stone ‚Äì 133 kg or 294 lb) and was known as the \\"Big Ship\\". He was not a stylish batsman but his strokeplay was effective, with a sound defence and temperament. He bowled leg spin with a gentle action and while not a big turner of the ball, he relied on accuracy to dismiss opponents. He made his Test debut in 1902 against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and was selected to tour England later that year where he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. That was the first of four tours of England. He was involved in several altercations with cricket administrators and was one of the \\"Big Six\\" who boycotted the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England after a dispute with the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket. A talented Australian rules footballer, Armstrong briefly represented South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League before playing Test cricket. For much of his cricket career he was employed as a pavilion clerk by the Melbourne Cricket Club, who allowed him time off to play cricket. Following his retirement from Test and first-class cricket after the successful 1921 tour of England, Armstrong took a position as an agent for a scotch whisky distributor and wrote on cricket for the Sydney Evening News. Early life Armstrong was born in the rural Victorian town of Kyneton in 1879, the eldest son of John and his wife Amelia (n√©e Flynn). The marriage was across the sectarian divide, then strong in Australia: John was an Anglican; Amelia was a Catholic.Haigh, pp. 7‚Äì14. The Armstrong family moved to Melbourne in 1880, settling in the inner suburb of Emerald Hill, Victoria. An inheritance enabled the family to move to a larger house, \\"Arra Glen\\" in North Caulfield, Victoria in 1888.Haigh, p. 17. Armstrong attended Cumloden School, a respected sporting member of the Schools Association, a group of smaller private schools in Melbourne. By 1893, he had found himself a spot in the school XI and came to the attention of the press, catching the eye of journalists Reginald Wilmot and Tom Horan.Haigh, p. 21. Armstrong joined the nearby Caulfield Cricket Club and played in a senior premiership with the club at the age of 15. The next year the St Kilda Cricket Club, one of the leading clubs in Melbourne's pennant competition, gave the youthful Armstrong a trial. In the 1896‚Äì97 season, Armstrong fell out with St Kilda and returned to Caulfield.Haigh, pp. 23‚Äì26. His last years of school were at University College.Haigh, p. 26. Leaving school at 19, Armstrong joined his father's former club, South Melbourne, captained by Australian Test captain Harry Trott.Haigh, p. 29. Armstrong was an immediate success, scoring 101 runs against University and 173 against his former club, St Kilda.Haigh, p. 30. He was selected to represent Victoria against Tasmania in Hobart in January 1899, as one of seven in the squad making their first-class cricket d√©buts. Armstrong's performance was promising, scoring six and 33 and taking four for 78 in 27 overs.Haigh, pp. 30‚Äì31. Armstrong began regular Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1899‚Äì1900 season. In his first match against New South Wales in January 1900, he dismissed Syd Gregory with his second delivery and scored 45 runs in the second innings.Haigh, p. 35. In the Pennant season for South Melbourne, Armstrong scored 665 runs at an average of 95; this included 145 and six for nineteen against the Melbourne Cricket Club, the largest club in Melbourne whose team included many Test and first-class cricketers.Haigh, p. 36. Representative cricket=Early career Following his feats against it in 1899‚Äì1900, Armstrong was recruited for the next season by the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC). For the next twenty years, on and off the pitch, Armstrong's fortunes were tied to the club, a leading cricketing light in Australia and a bastion of the city's rich and powerful.Haigh, pp. 37‚Äì39. He scored his maiden first-class century, 118, against South Australia, facing the very fast and physically dangerous bowling of Ernie Jones, and by the end of the 1900‚Äì01 season he was a permanent member of the Victorian team.Haigh, p. 40. The England cricket team, organised and captained by Archie MacLaren, toured Australia to compete for the Ashes in the summer of 1901‚Äì02. The English were considered a poor and undermanned team, but it surprised all by winning the first Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground by an innings and 124 runs.Wynne-Thomas, p. 52. Before the second Test, Armstrong had an excellent all-round performance against New South Wales, dismissing Test players Victor Trumper and Syd Gregory, and then scoring 137 in reply. When the team for the Melbourne Test was announced, Armstrong was selected, making his d√©but with Reggie Duff from New South Wales.Haigh, p. 43. Armstrong made a steady start to Test cricket. Batting at No. 9 on a sticky wicket, he made four not out in the first innings, in an Australian total of 116. In reply, England could only score 61. With the wicket still treacherous, Australia rearranged their batting order to save the better batsmen until conditions improved. The two debutants, Duff and Armstrong, were positioned at 10 and 11, and shared a 120-run partnership for the last wicket, Duff scoring 104 and Armstrong 45 not out. Australia won the Test by 229 runs. Armstrong played in the remaining Tests in the series, narrowly heading the averages with 159 runs at an average of 53, and Australia went on to win comfortably by four matches to one.Haigh, p. 46. Armstrong was selected as part of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1902.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 232‚Äì233. He started the tour well, taking eight for 47 in the second innings against Nottinghamshire, his best bowling figures to that date. The first Test, at Edgbaston was rain-affected and the Australians were lucky to come away with a draw, being dismissed for 36 in their first innings. The rest of the close-fought series was followed with interest by the English public. The second Test at Lord's was rained off, and Australia won the third at Bramall Lane by 143 runs. The final two Tests were nail-biters‚ÄîAustralia winning the fourth at Old Trafford by only three runs and England earning a consolation victory in the fifth Test at the Oval by one wicket, when last-wicket pair George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes eked out the final runs.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 233‚Äì234. Armstrong had a good tour, making 1,075 runs at 27.56 and taking 72 wickets at an average of 17.90, but the star for the Australians was Victor Trumper, who made 2,570 runs at an average of 48.49 including eleven centuries. On the return trip to Australia, the touring team stopped in South Africa to play three Tests, the first between the two nations. In the second Test at Johannesburg, Armstrong scored 159, just over half the Australian score of 309 and carried his bat through the innings as Australia won the Test by 159 runs. Australia won the Test series two‚Äìnil. On return to Australia for the 1902‚Äì03 season, he made 580 runs at an average of 58 and 23 wickets at an average of just over 19. The highlights of his season included 145 against Queensland and a hat-trick against New South Wales.Haigh, p. 76. Plum Warner's English team toured Australia in 1903‚Äì04, the first to do so under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club. The strong English team defeated Australia three‚Äìtwo, retrieving the Ashes.Wynne-Thomas, p. 56. Armstrong did not have a good series. He was tormented by Rhodes, who dismissed him eight times in ten meetings for Victoria and Australia that summer. As a result, he was dropped from the Australian XI after the Third Test.Haigh, p. 81. Returning to club cricket, Armstrong found form, scoring 438 in only 455 minutes for Melbourne against University, from a total score of 699 for eight.Haigh, p. 83. In the 1904‚Äì05 season, Armstrong scored 460 runs at 57.5 for Victoria to secure selection for the 1905 tour of England. Consolidation and conflict The 1905 Australians left for England, leaving behind the beginnings of a conflict between players and administrators over control of cricket that would poison the sport in Australia for the next ten years. While previous tours of England had been underwritten by the Melbourne Cricket Club and organised by the players, the new Australian Board of Control was asserting its right to control Australian cricket.Pollard, pp.172‚Äì174. Armstrong's stance at the wicket Armstrong, finding himself promoted to number five in the batting order, started the tour well with 112 against Nottinghamshire and 248 against Gentlemen of England at Lord's.Haigh, pp. 101‚Äì102. In the first Test at Trent Bridge, Australia's lack of effective bowling options had Armstrong forced to bowl wide outside the leg stump in an early form of leg theory bowling to prevent the England batsmen from scoring quickly. Bumbling and taciturn, Armstrong maintained an accurate line and length, and put a strangle on both England's run-scoring and the crowd's entertainment. It was a recurrent pattern for the rest of the series, and lead to what was seen by spectators and the press as dull cricket. Batsmen like the imperial Archie MacLaren would kick the ball away contemptuously, but lissome Johnny Tyldesley proved that runs could still made if a batsman employed more enterprise. Hopping away to leg to make room for himself, Tyldesley cut and drove the leg-spinner to great effect in a strategy later used by Don Bradman against the bodyline menace. Armstrong's tactics were ultimately futile, a Stanley Jackson-inspired England winning the series by two Tests to none.Wynne-Thomas, p. 237. For the season, he scored 1,902 runs at an average of fifty. Regarding his batting, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said, \\"The great batsman of the eleven was Armstrong. In form nearly all through the tour, he struck the happy medium, being brilliant without recklessness.\\" The highlight of his tour was a triple century (303 not out) at the Recreation Ground in Bath against Somerset. When the team returned to Australia, the rift between the players and the Board of Control widened. The dispute saw the English postpone their tour, scheduled for 1906‚Äì07.Wynne-Thomas, p. 60. In the midst of all this turmoil, Armstrong continued to impress: on tour with Melbourne Cricket Club in New Zealand, he was described by that country's Herald newspaper as a \\"team almost in himself\\".Haigh, p. 139. He made 868 runs at an average of 124 to complement his 83 wickets at under ten. He was elected captain of Victoria by his teammates for the match against New South Wales, commencing on New Year's Eve, responding with six for 68 with the ball and then scoring 168 in the second innings as part of a sturdy rearguard effort.Haigh, pp. 140‚Äì143. Armstrong found employment with the Department of Home Affairs and, as a result, declared himself unavailable for the next match against South Australia. He was mortified when he found that he had been included in the team and that the Victorian Cricket Association (VCA) had approached his employer to ask for leave on his behalf, despite his having explicitly instructed the VCA secretary otherwise. Armstrong refused to play and was called to face a disciplinary hearing at the Young and Jackson Hotel. Rightly indignant, he was left unpunished. The scheduled tour postponed from the previous season kicked off with the arrival of an English team weakened by the withdrawals of a number of leading players.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 62‚Äì63. The first Test saw an Australian victory, Armstrong bowling 53 overs and taking four for 92. More squabbling, this time over expenses, followed between Armstrong and the VCA, and the former withdrew from the Boxing Day match against New South Wales. Armstrong sought a ¬£1 per diem, but the VCA held fast at ten shillings. It then mounted a campaign in the Melbourne press, attempting to portray Armstrong as avaricious and once again called him to front a disciplinary commission. Following threats of suspension, Armstrong was forced to apologise to the VCA.Haigh, pp. 151‚Äì156. The fracas did not affect his form, however: the second Test, starting on New Year's Day, saw Armstrong score 31 and 77 and take five wickets for 89. Despite his efforts, England won a hard-fought Test by one wicket. Australia took the third Test in Adelaide, and a patient 133 in 289 minutes from Armstrong in the fourth saw Australia clinch the series and win back the Ashes. The margin was four‚Äìone, but both teams were criticised by reporters for slow scoring and negative cricket. Armstrong fielding Once again, the selection and management of the Australian team to tour England in 1909 caused friction between leading players and the Board of Control.Pollard, p. 175. Clem Hill, unwilling to tour on the terms offered by the Board, withdrew his name from consideration.Wynne- Thomas, p. 243. Regardless, the tour was a success, both for the Australians, who won the series two-one, and for Armstrong, who made 1,451 runs at an average of just under 44 and took 133 wickets at an average of 16.40Wynne- Thomas, pp. 242‚Äì244. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his role in the tour as \\"to keep the side together by means of his impregnable defence, and he did exactly what was required, only on rare occasions giving free play to his hitting power. When he likes to let himself loose there is no harder driver in the world\\". Armstrong, along with Monty Noble, Tibby Cotter and Bert Hopkins returned home via Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), Penang and Singapore, where they were lavishly entertained and comfortably billeted by the elite of the Colony. Their hosts took the cricketers on a trip to the British protectorate of Perak for a shooting expedition where Armstrong contracted malaria. He would suffer relapses throughout the rest of his life.Haigh, pp. 184‚Äì188. Rebellion Armstrong (left) and Trumper during the tour of England in 1905 Armstrong was appointed captain of an Australian team touring New Zealand in 1909‚Äì10, partly as recognition of his accomplishments and partly due to the unavailability of other candidates, such as Trumper. Suspicions still ran high between the Board and the players and Trumper, tiring of what he perceived as persecution, retired from first-class cricket. The tour did not include any Test matches, although a match was played against a representative New Zealand team. Australia won every game, save a draw against Canterbury. Armstrong, more diplomatic as captain than some commenters had been expecting, turned down a lucrative offer to coach the Auckland team.Haigh, pp. 189‚Äì193. The Melbourne Cricket Club found Armstrong a job as \\"pavilion clerk\\". His duties were broadly defined in order to allow him to meet his representative cricket obligations.Haigh, pp. 196‚Äì197. These included matches against the touring South Africans, scheduled to play five Tests in 1910‚Äì11. The first Test saw Australia win by an innings and 114 runs thanks mainly to an innings on 191 from Hill and eight wickets to Bill Whitty. Armstrong nearly missed the second Test in Melbourne with a case of mumps. He recovered, and although still unwell managed to score 75 and take 4‚Äì134 from 48 overs.Haigh, p. 203. In the fourth Test, Armstrong compiled another century, 132 including a partnership of 154 with Hill. Australia won the series comfortably, winning four of the five Test matches with their only loss at Adelaide by 38 runs. Returning to cricket after his self-imposed exile, Victor Trumper was the leading player for the Australians during the series scoring 661 runs at an average of 94. Armstrong as captain of the Australian team in Leicester in 1921 The English team returned to Australia the following season to compete for the Ashes with Pelham Warner once again captain of a very strong English team that included bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster. Warner suffered from an illness early in the tour and handed the captaincy to Johnny Douglas. After losing the first Test, England won the remaining four Tests comfortably.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 66‚Äì68. In the second Test at Melbourne, Armstrong played one of his best Test innings. Facing exceptional bowling from Foster and Barnes, he made a nerveless 90, including 14 boundaries, before being dismissed by Foster.Haigh, p. 212. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted rights of the players to appoint a manager when touring England.Pollard, p. 183. The hostility between the players and the board saw a fist fight break out between Clem Hill and Peter McAlister at a selection meeting.Robinson, p. 124. When the Board announced that George Crouch would be manager of the Australian team for the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, rather than the player's choice, Frank Laver, outright rebellion ensued. Armstrong, Hill and Trumper, along with Hanson Carter, Tibby Cotter and Vernon Ransford (known as the \\"Big Six\\") announced that they would be unavailable to join the touring party. The team, under the captaincy of Syd Gregory, left without these players. The tour was not a success on any front: the Australians winning only eight games and losing nine in a wet season and Crouch on return to Australia reported to the Board that \\"some of the players had conducted themselves so badly in England as to lead to the team being socially ostracised.\\" International cricket was placed on hold as a result of the outbreak of the Great War. Armstrong had been named captain of the Australian team to tour South Africa in 1914‚Äì15, however the tour was unable to take place.Haigh, p. 251. Armstrong chose not to enlist in the military during the war and kept his own counsel on the subject. He continued to work and play cricket for Melbourne Cricket Club, participating in the occasional fund-raising fixture.Haigh, pp. 253‚Äì255. Captain Armstrong (centre, middle row) with his 1920‚Äì21 team, considered one of the great Test teams of all time. When international cricket resumed after the Great War, Armstrong, now over forty years of age, was appointed captain of a strong Australian team boosted by the inclusion of players such as Jack Gregory and Herbie Collins who had starred in the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team. Armstrong was much older than many of his teammates and was the subject of some awe; Gregory describing him as \\"my ideal cricketer\\".Haigh, pp. 267‚Äì268. The English team, captained once again by Johnny Douglas was no match for the Australians, who won all five Tests in the 1920‚Äì21 series, completing the first and only Ashes whitewash for 86 years on 1 March. Armstrong was masterful throughout the Test series. He scored 474 runs at an average of over 77 including three centuries; 158 in Sydney, 121 in Adelaide and 123 not out in Melbourne. Before going out to bat in the second innings at Sydney, he was seen, \\"padded up, [drinking] whisky with his mates at the members' bar\\".Robinson, p. 139. Armstrong remained unpopular with the Board of Control. Despite Armstrong's triumphs, it was reported that he was only appointed captain of the 1921 Australian team to tour England by \\"the narrowest possible margin\\".Pollard, p. 209. On the voyage to England, Armstrong attempted to lose some weight by spending some time each day in the stokehold of the ship. On arrival, however, he weighed in heavier.Haigh, p. 332. Against English teams badly affected by the Great War, the Australians dominated the series. Armstrong marshalled his troops well, utilising Gregory and Ted McDonald to devastating effect. Australia won the first Test in two days, the second Test by lunch on the third day and the third Test and the Ashes by 5.00 pm on the third day.Pollard, p. 210. Throughout the tour, Armstrong fought a series of running battles against the Board appointed manager, Syd Smith, on behalf of his men. Smith, looking to cut overheads, had suggested boarding with wealthy cricket devotees; Armstrong dismissed the idea.Haigh, p. 334. The fourth Test at Old Trafford was famous for two events, both involving Armstrong. The first day's play was washed out and England commenced their innings the following day, the match now a two-day affair. Lionel Tennyson, the English captain, declared his innings closed with twenty minutes of play left in the day. The Australian wicket-keeper, Sammy Carter pointed out to Armstrong that a declaration at that time in a two-day match was against the laws of cricket as they stood at that time. Armstrong protested to the umpires and England were forced to continue batting. In the commotion, Armstrong managed to bowl two overs in succession, an action also against the laws of cricket.Robinson, pp. 143‚Äì144. By the fifth Test, the Australian team was in sight of being the first Australian team to remain unbeaten throughout a tour of England. Once again, much of the first day was lost to rain. Determined not to lose, Armstrong attempted to delay commencement after the rain and was heckled by English supporters.Haigh p.354. He told his three main bowlers, \\"I won't ask you not to get a man out, but as long as Mead (a notoriously slow scoring batsman) remains at the wicket we can't be beaten\\".Robinson, p. 144. In the last three hours of the Test, Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part-time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves. During this time, Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field and began to read. When asked about this later, Armstrong was said to have replied, \\"I wanted to see who we were playing\\", although this is claimed to be apocryphal.Haigh, p. 355 The Australians drew the Test and won the series three‚Äìnil, however they could not maintain their unbeaten record, losing by 28 runs to an English XI at Eastbourne and again to C. I. Thornton's XI at Scarborough.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 250‚Äì251. Despite the two losses, the tour was a triumph for Armstrong. Personally, he achieved the 1,000 runs and 100 wickets milestone for the third time in an English summer. About his captaincy, former rival Frank Foster said, \\"I honestly think that Australia have got to thank one man, one man only for their success. That man is Warwick Armstrong, probably one of the best captains ever sent to England from Australia\\".Haigh, p. 362. On return to Australia, Armstrong was greeted by large enthusiastic crowds and acclaimed at many public receptions.Haigh, p. 368. At one reception, he was presented with a ¬£2,500 cheque by the Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. Outside cricket The 1921 tour was Armstrong's swan song in first-class cricket. On the journey back to Australia, he suffered a relapse of the malaria that had plagued him since his earlier visit to Malaya. This kept him from taking part in any of the matches in South Africa, allowing Herbie Collins to captain Australia for the first time. Armstrong resigned from his job with Melbourne Cricket Club and drawing on contacts he had made while on tour took a role as an agent for Dawson's Scotch Whisky.Haigh, pp. 374‚Äì379. He remained in the liquor trade until his retirement in 1946.Haigh, p. 408. Armstrong also applied his cricket background acting as a cricket journalist for the Sydney Evening News. His copy was promoted as \\"frank and fearless\\" and was generally contemptuous of much of the cricket and cricketers he saw, especially of what he saw as dull cricket.Haigh, pp. 388‚Äì390. In 1922 he wrote a primer on cricket titled The Art of Cricket published by Methuen & Co, London. In July 1913 he married Aileen O'Donnell, the daughter of a wealthy Irish Australian pastoralist with large land holdings in the Riverina region of New South Wales.Haigh, p. 246. The couple met while Armstrong was representing the Melbourne Cricket Club in a match against a Wagga Wagga XV.Haigh, pp. 204‚Äì206. Armstrong and his new wife settled in Melbourne, moving to the Sydney suburb of Edgecliff for business reasons in 1935.Haigh, p. 406. Aileen died of a thrombosis in 1940. Armstrong, following illness that saw him lose much of the weight that he was known for, died on 13 July 1947, leaving an estate to the value of ¬£90,000.Fingleton, Jack: Masters of Cricket (Heinemann, 1958), p. 72. His funeral was held at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Edgecliff and proceeded to the South Head Cemetery. He was survived by his son, Warwick Geoffrey.Warwick Wndridge ‚Äì Billion Graves. Retrieved 10 August 2016. Armstrong was an all-round sportsman, playing Australian rules football in the winter for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL), the premier competition in the state, from 1898 to 1900. A slim utility, he played 16 games for the club, scoring 18 goals. He played in South Melbourne's losing 1899 VFL Grand Final team defeated by Fitzroy by one point.Main, pp. 9‚Äì10. Style and personality An innings-by-innings breakdown of Armstrong's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last 10 innings (blue line). Although slim as a young man, Armstrong grew into a big man, weighing and being 190 centimetres (6 foot 3 inches) tall.Robinson, p. 136. As a result, he acquired the nickname \\"The Big Ship\\".Robinson, p. 138. His oversize shirt, measuring by and his shoes, long by wide are on display at the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.Haigh, p. 20. A story told of Armstrong had a young boy following him around at a tour match in Southampton. Armstrong, thinking it a manifestation of hero worship, offered to sign the boy's autograph book. The boy turned to Armstrong and said, \\"Please, sir, you are the only bit of decent shade in the place.\\"Robinson, p. 137. As a batsman, Armstrong was not a stylist. The Times, in describing Armstrong's batting after he scored his maiden century against Sussex in 1902 said, \\"Mr. Armstrong's methods were not attractive\\".Haigh, pp. 92‚Äì93. Armstrong lumbers up to the crease to bowl. Armstrong was tireless as a leg break bowler and was known for his ability to land the ball on any point of the pitch he liked. His action imparted as much topspin as leg spin, making it difficult for batsman to detect his \\"straight-breaks\\". Early in his career, he bowled negative leg theory but later used his accuracy to great effect, bowling an over or two of leg breaks and then the straight one in the hope of bowling the batsman or receiving a leg before wicket dismissal. His action consisted of an easy amble and a gentle arc and was described in the Sporting Life as \\"rather like a fat uncle, not altogether unlike a fat aunt.\\"Haigh, p. 339. It was effective, however, with the Daily Telegraph stating after the first Test in 1921, \\"there is not a single batsman in England who faces with any appearance of confidence his innocuous slows.\\" Armstrong was renowned for his gamesmanship and was willing to push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable behaviour in order to obtain an advantage for his team. In 1909, the English all-rounder Frank Woolley was making his Test d√©but against the Australians at the Oval. Taking advantage of a rule that allowed bowlers to bowl trial balls or \\"looseners\\", Armstrong kept Woolley waiting nervously for more than fifteen minutes while he bowled trial balls alongside the pitch.Haigh, pp. 180‚Äì181. In a club game against St Kilda, Armstrong claimed a catch in the slips, only to have the umpire refuse the dismissal. It was the last ball of the over and as the field changed, Armstrong brusquely inquired why this was so. Informed that the ball had struck the batsman's pads, Armstrong then appealed for a leg before wicket dismissal, which the umpire then upheld.Haigh, pp. 319‚Äì320. Armstrong was not a \\"walker\\"; he believed in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, \\"The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa\\".Haigh, p. 321. English professional cricketers took a dim view of Armstrong's approach to the game. Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, > The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and > unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I > did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence > that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it > bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.Haigh, pp. > 179‚Äì180.; from Hobbs, Jack, My Cricket Memories, Heinemann, London, 1924.

It can refer to government welfare or a charitable gift, and it may take the form of money, food, or other necessities. During the Great Depression, many people lived entirely on handouts of one kind or another when they could not afford to buy food. The term became especially popular among hobos, who developed a system of signs and symbols to describe the nature, quantity, and availability of handouts. The term \\"handout\\" is used specifically in sociology and welfare analysis to identify direct payments or provision of goods, and to distinguish them from other forms of welfare support such as low-interest loans, subsidized housing, or medical care. However, some people feel it has a negative connotation, with the implication that a handout is unearned and undeserved. \\"Give a hand up, not a handout\\" is a common remark among proponents of workfare or other welfare-to-work systems. Another dichotomy characterization is \\"to be lifted up by a rope\\" vs stepping up onto a \\"ladder of opportunity\\". A well-known saying along this line is \\"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\\". The term \\"government handout\\" is often applied to both welfare systems as well as corporate welfare or pork. The biography of Star Parker (disclosed in detail in her books) is of a person who has lived on both sides of the dichotomy.

He was a leading representative of the historical or Romantic school in Belgian art and became a pioneer of the Realist movement in Belgium. His history and genre paintings and portraits earned him a European-wide reputation and his style was influential on artists in and outside Belgium. Life Henri Leys was born in Antwerp as the son of Hendrik-Jozef-Martinus Leys and Maria-Theresia Craen. His father ran a printing business specializing in religious images printed from old copper plates. The first etching by Henri Leys was a funeral image made for his father's shop in 1831. Henry Leys was not very interested in school but was very keen on drawing. His parents supported his proclivity and let him study under a furniture painter who lived next door. The Mass of Berthal de Haze Leys subsequently studied at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts: from 1829 to 1832 he studied from the Antique and from 1832 to 1833 he studied drawing from life. During this period he started to work in the studio of his brother-in-law, the genre painter Ferdinand de Braekeleer.Max Rooses, 'Joseph Lies' in: Max Rooses, 'Oude en Nieuwe Kunst', Boekhandel J. Vuylsteke, Ghent, 1896, pp. 99‚Äì125 One of Leys' teachers at the Academy was Mattheus Ignatius van Bree (1773-1839), the director of the Academy. According to a widely circulated story, during a lecture by van Bree on the draping of the gown and peplos of figures from antiquity Leys made a remark about van Bree's old- fashioned breeches. Van Bree did not appreciate the joke. But as the young hothead refused to apologize, the director expelled him from the Academy. Leys never returned to the Academy, not even as a teacher after he had achieved international success.Jan Lampo, De eerste burgerlijke uitvaart in Antwerpen, Schilder Lies reist naar het Eeuwige Oosten, in: EOS - Memo, 15-03-2014 Lucie Leys, daughter of the painter From the start of his career Leys painted history and genre subjects. During this period Leys often collaborated with the Belgian Romantic painter Gustaf Wappers (1803-1874). Both artists were interested in nationalistic subjects painted in styles that owe much to the example of 16th- and 17th-century Flemish painting. In 1835 Leys went to Paris where he visited the studio of Eug√®ne Delacroix and met Paul Delaroche. The influence of Delaroche's Romanticism is evident in Leys' early work.Sibylle Valcke. \\"Leys, Henri.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 June 2016 His precocious talent was manifested at the Brussels Salon of 1836 where he exhibited his Massacre of the magistrates of Louvain for which he received high praise.A. Cornette, Henri Leys G. Vanzijpe, Henri Leys. Nouvelle Soci√©t√© d'Editions, Bruxelles, in: De Gids. Jaargang 99, P.N. van Kampen & zoon, Amsterdam 1935, pp. 219‚Äì225 Leys married Adela√Øde van Haren in 1841. The couple had two daughters and a son. The family Leys initially lived in the Hobokenstraat.Christiaan Kramm, De levens en werken der Hollandsche en Vlaamsche kunstschilders, beeldhouwers, graveurs en bouwmeesters, van den vroegsten tot op onzen tijd, Gebroeders Diederichs, Amsterdam 1857-1864, pp. 976‚Äì979 In 1855 Leys had a more spacious house built in the street, which now bears his name, and was then called the Statiestraat. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on murals to decorate the dining room of his house. Leys became in 1852 member of the Kunstverbond or Cercle Artistique, Lit√©raire et Scientifique d‚ÄôAnvers ('Art Association'), a mainly French- speaking society of intellectuals and artists. Its honorary chairman was the liberal mayor of Antwerp Jan Frans Loos. In the same year a heated discussion had started about the reform of the Antwerp Academy after its director Gustaf Wappers had resigned from his post following political pressure. The Kunstverbond championed profound changes to the organisation of the Antwerp Academy. Leys' friend and fellow member of the Kunstverbond Joseph Lies authored a plan that called for the separation of the artistic and administrative functions in the Academy and for ending the practice of appointing the director for life. Leys, who was also member of the city council, defended the plan in the city council, but it was defeated. The vow Leys gained a considerable reputation at home and abroad and worked for an international clientele from Germany, France, England and Russia. He was made a knight in the French Legion of Honour and was awarded the Order of St. Michael by the king of Bavaria. Leys won a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1855 for his historical painting The Mass of Berthal de Haze (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). Critics praised the high quality of his reconstruction of the past through costumes and architecture, the realistic poses and facial expressions, the rigorous drawing and the brightness of the colours.James Tissot, Faust and Marguerite, at Mus√©e d'Orsay Leys won another gold medal in Paris in 1867. In 1862 Leys was created a baron by the Belgian King Leopold I.Jean F. Buyck, Henri Leys - Margareta van Parma overhandigt de stadssleutels aan de Antwerpse magistraat in OKV 1969 At the request of the Belgian government, which supported the development of history painting in the country, the Antwerp city administration gave Leys in 1861 a commission to decorate the interior of the restored Antwerp Town Hall. He was asked to paint over a period of 10 years 10 monumental murals depicting key events in the city's history. Four of the murals along with 11 portraits of historical rulers of Belgium were completed between 1863 and 1869, the year in which Leys died. Leys had also received a commission from the Brussels city administration for a similar program of murals in its town hall but this commission was never commenced due to the untimely death of Leys in 1869 in Antwerp. Leys had a number of pupils. Among these the best-known internationally is Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema who assisted Leys with the murals in the Antwerp Town Hall. Another well-known pupil was his nephew Henri De Braekeleer (1840-1888). Other pupils were Thomas Simon Cool, Charles Napier Hemy, Willem Linnig the Elder, Petrus Marius Molijn, Hendrik Albert van Trigt and Alexis Van Hamme.Henri Leys at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Soldiers playing cards Work Henry Leys initially worked in the Romantic style he had learned from Gustaf Wappers with whom he collaborated in the early phase of his career. He treated the typically Romantic subjects, ranging from heroic scenes of war and brigandage to scenes of daily life such as weddings and country festivals. Some of his works show the influence of Paul Delaroche, whom he had met in Paris in 1835. From about 1839, Leys distanced himself from the pathos and historical anecdotes of the Romantic school. He began painting scenes set in 16th-century Antwerp, combining details studied from life with a deliberately archaising style reminiscent of 15th and 16th- century Flemish and German painting. He abandoned the bravura technique inspired by Rubens in favour of line, shape and local colour.Jean F. Buyck, Henri Leys - Lucie Leys, dochter van de schilder in OKV 1966 Albrecht D√ºrer visiting Antwerp in 1520 Many of the paintings from this period depict specific historical subjects, while others were genre scenes or portraits. This development towards Realism made him one of the pioneers of this artistic movement in Belgium. The painting ‚Äô'Wedding in Flanders in the 17th century (1839; Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) was the first to herald this more sober style. His works from the 1640s attest to Leys' search for historical and psychological truthfulness, which replaced the emphasis on pathos and sentimental anecdote of his earlier work. An example of his works that abandoned historical legend in favour of a realistic depiction of historical events is the composition Albrecht D√ºrer visiting Antwerp in 1520. Leys based this picture on the account given by D√ºrer in his own journal of the event.Hugh Dunthorne, Michael Wintle, 'The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Britain and the Low Countries', Brill, 1 November 2012, pp. 192‚Äì193 In his scenes of 16th and 17th-century Antwerp, Leys sought to reflect the spirit and atmosphere of that time. His compositions of historical events and of everyday life were realistic and may have been inspired by contemporary French Realists Gustave Courbet and Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. The singer Leys' study of 16th-century Flemish and German painters also contributed to the development of a personal style, which mingled archaistic rigidity with realistic observation. With these works, he earned a following among many younger artists in Belgium as well as a considerable reputation in France, where he won a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1855 for his historical painting The Mass of Berthal de Haze (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels). Leys was a gifted portrait painter as shown by his self-portrait, and the portraits of his wife and daughter and of his fellow artists such as the portrait of the architect Alphonse Balat. Leys influenced many young Belgian artists. Some, such as Joseph Lies, Franz Vinck and Karel Ooms followed his work very closely. Leys' work also exerted a strong influence on his compatriots Jean Pierre Fran√ßois Lamorini√®re and Victor Lagye. James Tissot was influenced by Leys in his early work.Willard E. Misfeldt. \\"Tissot, James.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 August 2014 Other artists such as Henri De Braekeleer and Jan Stobbaerts were able to transform Leys' teachings in a new and original language.

All of his series and standalone works that are set in a universe evidently including the Gaean Reach, perhaps set inside it or outside it, have been catalogued as the Gaean Reach series or super-series. The Gaean Reach includes all worlds colonized by humans, among which trade and travel flow freely for the most part. Its name apparently means \\"the range (reach) of [the people from] Earth (Gaea)\\"; it could also be derived from Old English 'rice' (pronounced reech-e), meaning 'realm' (cf. German Reich). Some of these worlds are advanced and cosmopolitan, such as Alphanor; others, like Thamber, are inhabited by shipwrecked and forgotten people, who have reverted to feudalism. Some, like the world of Wyst in the Alastor Cluster, are undeniably strange in their culture and customs. The period of the Gaean Reach spans several centuries, if not millennia, at an indeterminate but very distant time in the future. Specific dates are given in the early books of the Demon Princes series, but not in the others. The human civilization in the Demon Princes is the Oikumene, which can be seen as a precursor to or variant of the Gaean Reach. The Reach is mentioned in the three Alastor books, the Cadwal Chronicles, Ports of Call and Lurulu.

His work is generally considered to be Flemish and he signed his work with the Flemish form of his name, Gustaf Wappers.Note: The painter is known by one or by several forenames, in English mainly in their French language versions: Gustave or less frequently in full Egide Charles Gustave ‚Äì though born in the Flemish city of Antwerp as Egidius Karel Gustaaf Wappers, and internationally also known as such though more often as Gustaaf Wappers. The more rare spelling as 'Gustaf' rather approaches a usual pronunciation in the dialect of Antwerp, and occurs in signatures at the back of paintings. The baronial title he was granted, belongs between forename(s) and surname. See e.g.: www.artfact.com Biography Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 (1834), Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels. He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and during 1826 in Paris. The Romantic movement with its new ideas about art and politics was astir in France. Wappers was the first Belgian artist to take advantage of this state of affairs, and his first exhibited painting, \\"The Devotion of the Burgomaster of Leiden,\\" appeared at the appropriate moment and had great success in the in 1830, the year of the Belgian Revolution. While political, this remarkable work revolutionized the direction of Flemish painters. Wappers was invited to the court at Brussels, and was favoured with commissions. In 1832 the city of Antwerp appointed him Professor of Painting.Note: Another source states 1833 (instead of 1832) for becoming a professor at the Antwerp Academy, and 1845 (instead of 1844) for the baronial title: He exhibited his masterpiece, \\"Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830\\" or rather \\"Episode of the September Days of 1830 on the Grand Place of Brussels\\", (Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) at the Antwerp Salon in 1834. He was subsequently appointed painter to Leopold, King of the Belgians. At the death of Matthieu- Ignace Van Br√©e in 1839 he was elevated to director of the Antwerp Academy. As a teacher at the Antwerp Academy he trained a great number of pupils including Ford Madox Brown, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, William Duffield, Emil H√ºnten, the Czech history painter Karel Jav≈Ørek, Jaroslav ƒåerm√°k, Ludwig von Hagn, Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans, Eugene van Maldeghem, Ferdinand Pauwels and Jacob Jacobs. His works are numerous. Some of them depict traditional devotional subjects (\\"Christ Entombed\\"), while others illustrate the Romantic view of history: \\"Charles I taking leave of his Children\\", \\"Charles IX\\", \\"Camoens\\", \\"Peter the Great at Saardam\\", and \\"Boccaccio at the Court of Joanna of Naples\\". Louis Philippe gave him a commission to paint a large painting for the gallery at Versailles, \\"The Defence of Rhodes by the Knights of St John of Jerusalem\\".

Aircraft view of cross sea near Lisbon. A cross sea (also referred to as a squared sea or square waves) is a sea state of wind- generated ocean waves that form nonparallel wave systems. Cross seas have a large amount of directional spreading. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old. Two weather systems that are far from each other may create a cross sea when the waves from the systems meet at a place far from either weather system. Until the older waves have dissipated, they can present a perilous sea hazard. This sea state is fairly common and a large percentage of ship accidents have been found to occur in this state. Vessels fare better against large waves when perpendicular to the waves. In a cross sea, vessels are more likely to be struck in a dangerous way. A cross swell is generated when the wave systems are longer-period swells, rather than short-period wind-generated waves.

A flying bridge is an open area on top of a surface ship that provides unobstructed views of the fore, aft, and the sides of a vessel, and that serves as an operating station for the ship's officers, such as the captain or officer of the watch.Thompson, Mark L. Queen of the Lakes. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1994, p. 123. Surface vessels Prior to World War II, virtually every sailing ship, steamship, monitor, paddle steamer, or large pleasure ship had a flying bridge above the pilot house or main bridge. Flying bridges were generally not enclosed at all (although sometimes they were partially enclosed), and often had little equipment‚Äîusually just a speaking tube or telephone to allow communication with the helmsman or wheelman on the main bridge. On military warships after 1914, the flying bridge was usually the station for the air defense officer and the gunnery officer. The amount of equipment on a flying bridge varies widely with the need of the captain. During World War II, for example, American submarine chaser surface ships had a well-outfitted flying bridge which usually contained a pelorus, signal lamps, telescope, and voice tube to permit the captain to command the ship.Jones.

The Sailor's Illustrated Dictionary. New York: Lyons Press, 2001, p. 173. Some flying bridges have \\"bridge wings\\", open areas which thrust outward from the flying bridge over the sides of the vessel by approximately to allow an officer to see the side of his ship while docking or working with smaller vessels. Since the 1980s, large pleasure craft may have a flying bridge toward the stern that is used as additional outdoor seating space and a place to store a tender. On the smallest surface vessels, such as a sport fishing boat, the flying bridge may have controls permitting the ship to be piloted from the flying bridge, but will lack the full range of controls of the pilot house. On larger small vessels, the flying bridge may actually be enclosed, in which case it is more properly called an \\"upper pilot house\\" or \\"upper bridge\\". Submarines On a submarine, the flying bridge is usually called \\"the bridge\\". It is the highest point on the conning tower, to provide for better visual navigation when on the surface. They became standard on United States Navy submarines after 1917, and greatly improved the function of the ships while at the surface.Friedman, Norman.

In this case the jackline runs from the aft starboard cleat to the bow in front of the first legs of the bow rail and back to the aft port cleat.''' A jackline is a rope or wire strung from a ship's bow to stern to which a safety harness can be clipped, allowing a crewmember to move about the deck safely when there is risk of falling or being swept overboard. At sea, falling overboard is one of the leading causes of death in boating; fastening oneself to the ship with a safety harness reduces this risk. Generally the jacklines are run from the bow to the stern on both starboard and the port side of a ship. Jack lines are used in heavy weather and in periods of reduced visibility, i.e. fog or at night. Jacklines may be rigged temporarily when bad weather is expected, or, especially on sailboats heading offshore, they may be left in place all the time and used as necessary. They are usually attached to strong padeye or cleat fittings at both ends of the boat, allowing the crewmember to move fore and aft by sliding their harness' clip along the line. Jacklines may be made of wire or low-stretch rope. More recently, sailors are using high strength nylon webbing. The reason is that flat webbing does not roll under foot while working on deck and there is less chance to confuse it with other lines in difficult conditions. This reduces the hazard that can be created by using rope. Blue safety line tied off to the red jackline with clip A jackline is also a rope installed in the luff of a mainsail to allow the luff slides to migrate horizontally away from the mast when the sail is reefed. By allowing the slides to migrate, more space is left in the mast track for the upper luff slides to descend, making the operation easier.

Dotted ƒ∞i and dotless Iƒ± are separate letters in Turkish, Azerbaijani, Kazakh and other Latin alphabets of several Turkic languages. It is also part of the common Turkic Alphabet. The dotless I, I ƒ±, usually denotes the close back unrounded vowel sound (). Neither the upper nor the lower case version has a dot. The dotted ƒ∞, ƒ∞ i, usually denotes the close front unrounded vowel sound (). Both the upper and lower case versions have a dot. Examples: * is the Turkish spelling for Istanbul. It starts with an i sound in standard dialect of Turkish, not an ƒ±. * is the Turkish spelling for Diyarbakƒ±r. In Turkish the first and last vowels are spelled and pronounced differently. * is the Azerbaijani spelling for Baku. In contrast, the letter j does not have this distinction in these languages, with a dot only on the lower case character: J j, but the dotless j does exist in Unicode: »∑. That letter is sometimes used in mathematics with a combining hat to indicate a unit vector. In scholarly writing on Turkic languages, √Ø is sometimes used for .Marcel Erdal, A Grammar of Old Turkic, Handbook of Oriental Studies 3, , 2004, p. 52 Implications for ligature use right In some fonts, if the lowercase letters fi are placed adjacently, the dot-like upper end of the f would fall inconveniently close to the dot of the i, and therefore a ligature glyph is provided with the top of the f extended to serve as the dot of the i. A similar ligature for ffi is also possible. Since the forms without ligatures are unattractive and the ligatures make the i dotless, such fonts are not appropriate for use in a Turkish setting. However, the fi ligatures of some fonts do not merge the letters and instead space them next to each other, with the dot on the i remaining. Such fonts are appropriate for Turkish, but the writer must be careful to be consistent in the use of ligatures. In computing In normal typography, when lower case i is combined with other diacritics, the dot is generally removed before the diacritic is added; however, Unicode still lists the equivalent combining sequences as including the dotted i, since logically it is the normal dotted i character that is being modified. Most Unicode software uppercases ƒ± to I and lowercases ƒ∞ to i, but, unless specifically configured for Turkish, it lowercases I to i and uppercases i to I. Thus uppercasing then lowercasing, or vice versa, changes the letters. In the Microsoft Windows SDK, beginning with Windows Vista, several relevant functions have a NORM_LINGUISTIC_CASING flag, to indicate that for Turkish and Azerbaijani locales, I should map to ƒ± and i to ƒ∞. In the LaTeX typesetting language the dotless ƒ± can be written with the backslash-i command: \`\\\\i\`. The ƒ∞ can be written using the normal accenting method (i.e. \`\\\\.{I}\`). Dotless ƒ± (and dotted capital ƒ∞) is handled problematically in the Turkish locales of several software packages, including Oracle DBMS, PHP, Java (software platform),The Policeman‚Äôs Horror: Default Locales, Default Charsets, and Default Timezones and Unixware 7, where implicit capitalization of names of keywords, variables, and tables has effects not foreseen by the application developers. The C or US English locales do not have these problems. The .NET Framework has special provisions to handle the 'Turkish i'.MSDN: Writing Culture-Safe Managed Code: The Turkish Example Many cellphones available in Turkey (as of 2008) lacked a proper localization, which led to replacing ƒ± by i in SMS, sometimes severely distorting the sense of a text. In one instance, a miscommunication played a role in the deaths of Emine and Ramazan √áal√ßoban in 2008. The use of \\"i\\" resulted in an SMS with a completely twisted meaning: instead of writing the word \\"sƒ±kƒ±≈üƒ±nca\\" it looked like he wrote \\"siki≈üince\\". Ramazan wanted to write \\"You change the topic every time you run out of arguments\\" (sounds familiar enough) but what Emine read was, \\"You change the topic every time they are fucking you\\" (sounds familiar too.) A common substitution is to use the character 1 for dotless ƒ±. This is also common in Azerbaijan (see also translit), but the meaning of words is generally understood. John Cowan proposed disunification of plain Ii and capital letter dotless I and small letter I with dot above to make the casing more consistent. The Unicode Technical Committee had previously rejected a similar proposal because it would corrupt mapping from character sets with dotted and dotless I and corrupt data in these languages. Error when displaying dotted ƒ∞ as a dotless I while translating from Turkish to Polish In some Ectaco translators, the letter ƒ∞ was also treated as I (e.g. TRAFIK , when it is normally TRAFƒ∞K). Usage in other languages Crimean Tatar Latin script in Bakhchisaray with both dotted and dotless i. Dotted and dotless i are used in several other writing systems for Turkic languages: * Azerbaijani: The Azerbaijani Latin alphabet used in Azerbaijan is modeled after Turkish since 1991. * Karakalpak: The official Karakalpak alphabet approved in 2016 uses as the lowercase form of . * Kazakh: The 2018 Latin orthography uses dotless I to represent and also to represent in Russian loanwords, contrary to the letter's use in other Turkic languages. A Turkish-style alphabet, however, is used by linguists, the Kazakh Wikipedia (in addition to Cyrillic and Arabic) and the Kazakh diaspora in the West and Turkey. Dotted I in the Kazakh orthography represents in native Kazakh words - its capital form was still dotless until 2019. In the original 2017 proposal, /j/ and (in Russian loanwords) /i/ were represented by the sequence i'. , represented by dotless I in most Turkic orthographies, is instead represented by y. In 2019, under president Tokayev's suggestion, the upper-case ƒ∞ was also introduced, to finalize replacing of upper-case Cyrillic –Ü which mostly represents . * Volga Tatar: The Tatar alphabet in Russia is officially Cyrillic due to the requirements of Russian federal law. Several Romanization schemes exist, which are used on the Internet and some printed publication. Most of them are modelled in different ways on Turkish and employ dotted and dotless I, while some also use I with acute (√ç), although for different phonemes. The only Latin alphabet that ever had official status in Tatarstan, Ya√±alif, used the character –¨ instead of dotless i. * Crimean Tatar: Cyrillic script is officially used for Crimean Tatar in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Latin alphabet, which includes both dotted and dotless I, is still used, but is not the official script for the language. The dotless ƒ± may also be used as a stylistic variant of the dotted i, without there being any meaningful difference between them. This is common in Irish, for example. See Tittle. Both the dotted and dotless I can be used in transcriptions of Rusyn to allow distinguishing between the letters –´ and –ò, which would otherwise be both transcribed as \\"y\\", despite representing different phonemes. Under such transcription the dotted ƒ∞ would represent the Cyrillic –Ü, and the dotless I would represent either –´ or –ò, with the other being represented by \\"Y\\".

A legionary helmet was found in Bosham harbour and is now in Lewes museum. The helmet is of late Claudian date, the time of the invasion. Tradition holds that Emperor Vespasian maintained a residence in Bosham, although there is no evidence of this. There are also said to be remains of a building popularly thought to be a villa belonging to Vespasian, at the Stone Wall in the parish. Pottery and tile fragments, of both Roman and early British period, have been discovered in the area, confirming pre-Anglo- Saxon activity. The possible Roman harbour here was part of the natural harbours between Portsmouth and Chichester known as Magnus PortusRoman Britain, Magnvs Portvs: http://roman-britain.co.uk/names/magnus_portus.htm and its position, as latitude and longitude, was plotted as part of Ptolemy's Geography. Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods The mill-stream where King Canute's daughter is reputed to have drowned. Much of Bosham's history during the Early Middle Ages is ecclesiastical. Bede mentions Bosham in his book The Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, speaking of Wilfrid's visit here in 681 when he encountered a Celtic monk, Dicul, and five disciples in a small monastery. The village is one of only five places that appear on the map attached to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of around this time. In 850, the original village church was built possibly on the site of a Roman building, and in the tenth century was replaced with Holy Trinity Church, situated beside Bosham Quay, that still serves as the local place of worship. There is a tradition that a daughter of Canute the Great drowned in a nearby brook and was buried here, although there seems to be little evidence for this. The tradition was originally linked to a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century effigy.Discussed in 'Bosham', A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4: \\"The Rape of Chichester\\" (1953). In 1865 a coffin containing a child's skeleton was discovered, buried in the nave in front of what is now the chancel of Holy Trinity Church. This was thought to be Canute's daughter.Account of discovery in The Gentleman's Magazine, 1865 (page 435 onwards).Poem about the death of Canute's daughter. poetrymagazines.org.uk. There is also a tradition that Canute had a palace in the village, perhaps where the Manor House now stands, or possibly at the harbour's edge, but no evidence has emerged. Legend has it that Bosham was the site at which he commanded the waves to \\"go back\\", so as to demonstrate to his overly deferential courtiers the limits of a King's powers. There is also a legend that around this time Bosham Church was plundered by Danish pirates, who stole the tenor bell. As the pirate ship sailed away, the remaining church bells were rung. The tenor bell miraculously joined in, destroying the ship. The bell is still said to ring beneath the waters whenever the other bells are rung. =Harold Godwinson= In the Bayeux Tapestry's second scene, \\"Where Harold, Earl of the English, and his knights ride to Bosham Church.\\" Bosham is mentioned by name in the Bayeux Tapestry, referring to the 1064 meeting of Harold and Edward the Confessor on the way to meet William of Normandy to discuss who would succeed Edward to the throne: :\\"Ubi Harold Dux Anglorum et sui milites equitant ad Bosham ecclesia[m]\\" :(Where Harold, Earl of the English, and his army ride to Bosham church) Harold's strong association with Bosham and the recent discovery of an Anglo-Saxon grave in the church has led some historians to speculate that King Harold was buried here following his death at the Battle of Hastings, rather than Waltham Abbey as is often reported. The speculation began in 1954, when the nave was re-paved, and the body of King Canute's reputed daughter was re-examined. It was discovered that the body of a richly dressed man was buried beside the child's. A request to exhume the grave in Bosham church was refused by the Diocese of Chichester in December 2004, the Chancellor ruling that the chances of establishing the identity of the body as that of Harold Godwinson were too slim to justify disturbing a burial place.In re Holy Trinity, Bosham [2004] Fam 124 ‚Äì decision of the Chichester Consistory Court regarding opening King Harold's supposed grave. =Domesday Book= The Domesday Book (1086) lists Bosham as one of the wealthiest manors in England.

This design originated to meet the navigational demands on lake freighters on the U.S./Canadian Great Lakes routes. The term \\"Straight Decker\\" is commonly used upon the Great Lakes to denote a bulk/ore freighter which has not been equipped with self-unloading machinery.Steamboats and Sailors of the Great Lakes, Mark L. Thompson, 1991, p. 198 Straight Deckers are mainly owned by the Canadian fleets, such as Upper Lakes Shipping (ULS). One exception is the 730-foot U.S. lake freighter Edward L. Ryerson (nicknamed 'Fast Eddie' because of her 19-mph speed). Originally launched in 1960, she had a short layup from 1986 to 1988 due to a downturn in the industry. She went into long term layup in 1998 and joined the fleet once again in 2006, but has been laid up since 2009 at Lake Superior's Fraser Shipyard.Edward L. Ryerson (Fast Eddy on Ice) February 15, 2013 The Edward L. Ryerson is one of only two remaining straight- deck bulk carriers still part of the American fleet on the Great Lakes, the other being the John Sherwin.Great Lakes Fleet Page Vessel Feature -- Edward L. Ryerson The Ryerson was the last U.S. laker to be built as a steamer (with a GE 9,900 shp cross-compound steam turbine engine), the last to be built without a self-unloader, the last lake boat to be constructed at the Manitowoc, Wisc. shipyards, and the last and only one to be built with such aesthetically pleasing lines. Straight deckers without self-unloading gear are loaded and unloaded by gantry cranes or Hulett Unloaders. These giants use a clamshell bucket and counterweight system to scoop the cargo out of the holds, one scoop load at a time. Hulett bucket unloaders at work Self-unloading equipment is usually in the form of a boom on deck. The boom is usually positioned on the back half of the vessel, pointing forward. The boom is swung out to either side of the vessel, a conveyor system is started, and the offloading process begins. The boom is a much more efficient method of unloading and allows the boat to serve a wider variety of ports which have no shore-side unloading gear. This also allows a greater variety of cargoes to be hauled and, therefore, the opportunity to run more trips each season. Many historic straight deckers have been converted to self-unloaders or retired from service. For instance, the steam-powered straight decker James Norris was converted to a self-unloader in 1980 but, by 2008, still had not been converted from steam to diesel. The largest straight-decker, the 806-foot John Sherwin has not sailed under its own power since 1981, and its conversion to a diesel self-unloader in 2008 was suspended because of the world economic downturn. Some self unloaders can have a rather straight decker look. For example, the 1000-foot Stewart J. Cort has a shuttle boom inside the aft deckhouse. The shuttle boom can be extended to reach hoppers on the docks, specially designed for the purpose.

He is known in particular for his work on the economies of synthetic worlds. Biography Edward Castronova obtained a BS in International Affairs from Georgetown University in 1985 and a PhD in Economics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1991. In between, he spent 18 months studying German postwar reconstruction and social policy at universities and research institutes in Mannheim, Frankfurt, and Berlin. From 1991 to 2000, he worked as an Assistant and then Associate Professor of Public Policy and Political Science at University of Rochester, after which he became an Associate Professor of Economics in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Fullerton. In the fall 2004, he joined the faculty of Indiana University Bloomington as an associate professor of Telecommunication and Cognitive Science, later becoming a full professor and also the Director of Graduate Studies in the department .Biography at 2007 NMC Summer Conference Edward Castronova homepage His works on synthetic worlds and their economies, and on EverQuest in particular, have attracted considerable attention. His paper on Norrath, a fictional planet in the EverQuest universe, Virtual Worlds: A First-Hand Account of Market and Society on the Cyberian Frontier (2001) is available on SSRN. It claims, for example, that Norrath has a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria, higher than that of China and India, and that a unit of EverQuest currency is worth more than the Yen or Lira. He is one of four founders (along with Julian Dibbell, Dan Hunter and Greg Lastowka) of the game research blog Terra Nova. He also created the Indiana University Ludium game conferences which were built on the structure of a collaborative game environment. In 2008, he and his team finished work on the MacArthur Foundation supported academic experiment massively multiplayer online gaming, Arden: The World of Shakespeare. They documented that people in fantasy games act in an economically normal way, purchasing less of a product when prices are higher, all other things being equal. This finding may open the way for future study in synthetic worlds of real economic behavior.

An extended version of the second movement of Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1939) is included, as well as a piece called \\"Will o' the Wisp\\", from Manuel de Falla's ballet El amor brujo (1914‚Äì1915). Sketches of Spain is regarded as an exemplary recording of Third Stream, a musical fusion of jazz, European classical, and styles from world music. Background Davis' wife Frances Davis insisted he accompany her to a performance by flamenco dancer Roberto Iglesias. Inspired by the performance, Davis bought every flamenco album he could get at Colony Records shop in New York City. The album pairs Davis with arranger and composer Gil Evans, with whom he had collaborated on several other projects, on a program of compositions largely derived from the Spanish folk tradition. Evans explained: > [We] hadn't intended to make a Spanish album. We were just going to do the > Concierto de Aranjuez. A friend of Miles gave him the only album in > existence with that piece. He brought it back to New York and I copied the > music off the record because there was no score. By the time we did that, we > began to listen to other folk music, music played in clubs in Spain... So we > learned a lot from that and it ended up being a Spanish album. The Rodrigo, > the melody is so beautiful. It's such a strong song. I was so thrilled with > that. The folk songs in the album were inspired by recordings made by Alan Lomax in Galicia and Andalusia, which were released in 1955 by Columbia Masterworks.Lomax, Alan (Ed.). (1955). The Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music ‚Äì Volume XIII: Spain. Columbia Masterworks. Concierto de Aranjuez The opening piece, taking up almost half the record, is an arrangement by Evans and Davis of the adagio movement of Concierto de Aranjuez, a concerto for guitar by the contemporary Spanish composer Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo. Following the faithful introduction of the concerto's guitar melody on flugelhorn, Evans' arrangement turns into a \\"quasi-symphonic, quasi-jazz world of sound\\", according to his biographer. The middle of the piece contains a \\"chorus\\" by Evans unrelated to the concerto but \\"echoed\\" in the other pieces on the album.Crease, Stephanie Stein (2003). Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music. Chicago Review Press; p. 207. The original melody then reappears in a darker mode. Davis plays flugelhorn and later trumpet, attempting to connect the various settings musically. Davis commented at rehearsal, \\"The thing I have to do now is make things connect, make them mean something in what I play around it\\".Chambers, Jack (1998). Milestones: The Music And Times Of Miles Davis. Da Capo Press; pp. 10-11. Davis thought the concerto's adagio melody was \\"so strong\\" that \\"the softer you play it, the stronger it gets, and the stronger you play it, the weaker it gets\\", and Evans concurred. According to Davis' biographer Chambers, the contemporary critical response to the arrangement was not surprising, especially given the scarcity of anything resembling a jazz rhythm in most of the piece. Martin Williams wrote that \\"the recording is something of a curiosity and a failure, as I think a comparison with any good performance of the movement by a classical guitarist would confirm\\". The composer Rodrigo was also not impressed, but royalties from the arrangement brought him \\"a lot of money\\", according to Evans. Critical reception In a contemporary review for Down Beat, Bill Mathieu hailed Sketches of Spain as one of the 20th century's most important musical works so far and a highly intellectual yet passionate record. He found Evans's compositions extremely well crafted and Davis's playing intelligently devised, concluding in his review, \\"if there is to be a new jazz, a shape of things to come, then this is the beginning.\\" Replying to suggestions that Sketches of Spain was something other than jazz, Davis said \\"it's music, and I like it\\". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), J. D. Considine called it \\"a work of unparalleled grace and lyricism\\", while Q magazine said it \\"took orchestral jazz in a new direction\\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic about the record and recalled being a young listener when it was released: \\"In 1960 [it] catapulted Davis into the favor of the kind of man who reads Playboy and initiated in me one phase of the disillusionment with jazz that resulted in my return to rock and roll\\". For Sketches of Spain, Evans and Davis won the 1961 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Composition of More Than Five Minutes Duration. The album was ranked number 358 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 393rd most frequently ranked record on critics' all-time lists.

Founded in 1925 as a public-service organization, it is Denmark's oldest and largest electronic media enterprise. DR is a founding member of the European Broadcasting Union. DR is funded by a media licence which is charged to all Danish households with television sets, computers, smartphones and other devices with internet access. Today, DR operates six television channels, all of which are distributed free-to-air via a nationwide DVB-T network. DR also operates eight radio channels. All are available nationally on DAB+ radio and online, with the four original stations also available on FM radio. History DR was founded on 1 April 1925 under the name of Radioordningen, which was changed to Statsradiofonien in 1926, then to Danmarks Radio in 1959, and to DR in 1996. During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, radio broadcasts were censored ‚Äì under particularly harsh conditions from August 1943 ‚Äì leading many Danes to turn to Danish-language broadcasts from the BBC or the illegal press, as well as Swedish radio in 1944‚Äì1945. Statsradiofonien's second FM radio station, Program 2 (P2), was added in 1951, followed by P3 in 1963. Experimental television broadcasts started in 1949, with regular programming beginning on 2 October 1951 with the launch of Denmark's first television channel. Daily programming began in 1954. Colour television test broadcasts were started in March 1967, with the first large-scale colour broadcasting occurring for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.40 √•r med farve-tv fra DR Danmarks Radio officially ended its \\"test\\" transmissions of colour television on 1 April 1970, although it wasn't until 1978 that the organisation's last black-and-white television programme (TV Avisen‚ÄîThe News) went over to colour. At 14.00 local time on 16 May 1983 DR launched its first teletext information service, which is still available on all DR channels. Danmarks Radio's monopoly on national television lasted until 1988, when TV 2 started broadcasting. 8 years later DR launched their second television channel, DR2, on 30 August 1996.Om DR (About DR), Danmarks Radio corporate website, Undated. Retrieved January 12, 2012. It was sometimes called den hemmelige kanal (\\"the secret channel\\") in its early years because it could not be seen nationwide at its launch. The first trials of DAB were carried out in 1995, with eight channels officially launching in October 2002. On 7 June 2007 DR launched an online-only news channel DR Update. It was later added as a traditional channel. With the switch to over-the-air digital signals on 1 November 2009, DR added three new channels to its lineup; * DR K - an intercultural, documentary and \\"odd-film\\" channel. * DR HD ‚Äì Denmark's first free-to-air high-definition channel intended to air successful shows from the other DR channels in true HD only, with no upscaling. * DR Ramasjang, a children's channel. In 2013 a new logo in which the letters \\"DR\\" featured in a white sans-serif font on a black background was introduced, and the line-up of television channels was changed once again. A new channel targeting young people, DR3 replaced DR HD. Another channel for children, DR Ultra replaced DR Update. The closure of DR Update was the start of a revamping of DR 2 as a channel for news and society. A nationwide switch from DAB to the newer DAB+ format took place on 1 October 2017. All of DR's stations plus the privately owned, public service channel - Radio24Syv, moved to the second national DAB+ multiplex (DAB-blok 2).

Financing  The principal means of funding DR is through the media licence, costing 2,492 DKK per year per household since 2017. Traditionally it was the owners of radio and television receiving sets who were obliged to pay the licence fee. The increased availability of online streaming, however, led to the replacement on 1 January 2007 of the television licence by a more widely payable \\"media licence\\". This licence is mandatory not just for those with television sets but also for all those who own a computer, smartphone, or any other device enabling access to the internet. In 2007 approximately 180,000 households did not pay media licence. Additional revenue comes from such commercial activities as the mounting of DR-organized concerts and other events in the Koncerthuset, the sale of books, CDs, and DVDs, as well as overseas sales from the catalogue of DR-made programmes. Over a period of four years starting in 2019 through 2022 the media licence will be replaced by general taxation, as announced on 16 March 2018 by a majority in the Danish Parliament consisting of Venstre, Conservatives, Liberal Alliance, and Danish People's Party.

Geographical terrestrial coverage  Denmark All of Denmark is covered by digital terrestrial reception through a nationwide DVB-T and MPEG-4 network comprising six multiplexes (MUX). DR owns MUXes 1 and 2 in a joint-venture between DR and TV 2. MUXes 1 and 2 broadcast all six DR channels unencrypted. Given the low topography of the Danish mainland and islands, so-called signal overspill is inevitable if every part of the country is to receive coverage. Hence, all DRs' channels are available in northernmost Germany, and Scania the southernmost part of Sweden. Greenland Every city in Greenland can receive DR1, DR2 and DR Ultra free-to-air via a public DVB-T network.

The prizewinner commits to hold a number of radio lectures. The prize is named after Jens Rosenkj√¶r (1883‚Äì1976), Head of State Broadcasting 1937‚Äì53. The prize is now DKK 50,000, up from 25,000 in 2008, and 40,000 in 2009Rosenkjaer Prize Board of directors DR's board of directors comprises 11 members appointed for a four-year period. Three members, including the chair, are appointed by the Minister of Culture, and six by Parliament, while the employees of DR elect two members. The board has overall responsibility for DR programs and for the hiring of DR's chief executive, the director general, and the remaining management positions.  Relocation of DR and funding crisis  The former headquarters of DR, Radiohuset on Rosen√∏rns All√© DR moved in 2006-2007 all its activities from Radiohuset in Frederiksberg and TV-Byen in S√∏borg to a new complex in the √òrestad area of Copenhagen. The new building, called DR Byen (the DR city), covers an area of approximately . The project became more expensive than planned, forcing DR to make drastic budget cuts. In April 2007 it was announced that 300 employees would be laid off, meaning that most of the sports department would be closed down as well as most of the educational department, several programmes and the radio channel DR X. DR would also give up its rights to the Olympic Games and attempt to sell the rights to a number of other sports events including football. As the major recipient of license funds, DR operates under a public service contract with the government which it was unable to fulfil in the wake of the budget crisis related to the move. The budget overspends caused a major scandal which saw senior management of DR replaced, and was followed by a heated political debate over whether the service should receive additional emergency funding. Various measures to mitigate the impact on the public service obligations of the institution were contemplated by the Danish Parliament, and a compromise was agreed to limit the impact of the deficit. Accusations of bias For over a decade, the Danish People's Party, a nativist and anti-immigrant political party, has criticised DR for alleged bias in its political news coverage, citing the process for appointment to DR's board of directors. In response, DR set up a \\"watchdog committee\\" intended to detect and report upon any bias. The first large-scale scientific content analysis of political news coverage on DR published by the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, studying election news coverage in the years 1994‚Äì2007, documented no persistent political bias towards either the left or the right. News coverage of political actors and parties was found to be largely similar to the news coverage on DR's competitor TV 2. The study concluded that political news coverage on both broadcasters was guided by journalistic professional criteria as to the newsworthiness of political actors and political issues, not by partisan considerations. In 2008, Mikael Rothstein, author and professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, was highly critical of DR when it issued a Christian values policy, declaring that Muslims would feel excluded.New edict forcing DR to convey ChristianityDanish Radio Embraces Christian Values, Hurriyet Daily News, Turkey  See also  * List of television stations in Denmark * NORMOB References External links  * Official site * About DR * Information on the media licence Category:1925 establishments in Denmark Category:Commercial-free television networks Category:European Broadcasting Union members Category:Mass media companies established in 1925 Category:Publicly funded broadcasters Category:Radio in Denmark Category:Radio stations established in 1925 Category:State media Category:Television channels and stations established in 1951 Category:Television in Denmark ","title":"DR (broadcaster)"},{"id":"1500566","title":"Jeroen Tel"},{"id":"1500568","text":"Esk is a town and locality in the Somerset Region in South East Queensland, Australia. In the , Esk had a population of 1,698 people. Geography Esk Post Office, 2010 Aerial view of Esk with flooded Wivenhoe Dam in the background, photographed a week after the devastating floods of January 2011 Esk is approximately northwest of Ipswich on the Brisbane Valley Highway. It was named after the River Esk in Scotland and England. It is the administrative centre of the Somerset Region. The town of Esk is contained in the Queensland electoral district of Nanango. History Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, Yugarabul, Yuggera and Yuggerabul) is one of the Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland. There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. Esk formed part of the southern border of the Garumga clan of the Dalla tribe. The land around Esk was first explored by Captain Patrick Logan in 1830. The town was established to service the short- lived copper mines of Eskdale and Cressbrook Creek. Settlers moved into the region during the 1840s. Mount Esk Post Office opened on 1 February 1874 (a receiving office had been open from 1873) and was renamed Esk by February 1881. Mount Esk State School was opened on 1 November 1875 and was renamed Esk State School in 1887. In 1886, the Brisbane Valley railway line reached Esk from Lowood. Several sawmills were built and in 1904 a butter factory opened. The timber industry declined in the 1920s. St Agnes' Anglican Church was dedicated on Monday 28 October 1889 by Bishop William Webber. In July 1941, a Lutheran church was opened. Dairying slowed from the 1960s onwards, which has eventually led to the decline of the town's importance as a major rural centre.

It was the first document in American history that severed both political and religious ties with England. History The document was written and signed by a group of Christian dissidents who were seeking religious freedom from the governmental oversight of the Massachusetts Bay Colony by moving to Aquidneck Island to set up a new colony. Among this group was Anne Hutchinson, who had been banished from Massachusetts Bay following the Antinomian Controversy there. The purpose of the Portsmouth Compact was to set up a new, independent colony that was Christian in character but non-sectarian in governance. It has been called \\"the first instrument for governing as a true democracy.\\" Text The text of the Portsmouth Compact: :The 7th Day of the First Month, 1638. :We whose names are underwritten do hereby solemnly in the presence of Jehovah incorporate ourselves into a Bodie Politick and as He shall help, will submit our persons, lives and estates unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and to all those perfect and most absolute laws of His given in His Holy Word of truth, to be guided and judged thereby.

He was a gentleman essayist who was a biographer of his own privileged aristocratic family, a historian of the Ming Dynasty, and a biographer of notable virtuous figures. He wrote his own obituary which included the lines : He loved pretty maidservants, he loved handsome serving boys . . . he loved perfect food . . . he loved paintings of flowers and birds. Zhang was a prolific writer, having penned more than thirty books covering literature and history; however only a few of Zang's numerous works remain extant today. Zhang Dai's most famous books are: * Tao An Meng Yi (Èô∂Â∫µÂ§¢ÊÜ∂ Reminiscences in Dreams of Tao An), written ca. 1665. * Xi Hu Meng Xun (Ë•øÊπñÂ§¢Â∞ã Search The West Lake in Dreams)  Life  Zhang Dai was born in Ming Dynasty Wanli 25th year (1597 AD) in Shanyin (Â±±Èô∞), now Shaoxing of Zhejiang province, China. His ancestors came from Sichuan Zhang Dai never passed the Imperial examinations which led to the Ming civil service, instead he became a private scholar and aesthete. His family's wealth allowed him to develop his aesthetic tastes in such pursuits as Moon watching festivals, Chinese lantern design, the sponsorship of dramatic troupes, appreciation of tea, and garden and landscape aesthetics. His writing tries to convey the sensuality and subtlety of these pursuits. His inwardly focused mind did not see the coming collapse of the Ming in 1644‚Äì1645. When anarchy and war broke over his beloved landscape in the Yangtze delta he was forced to flee to the mountains where he hid as a Buddhist monk. When he returned in 1649 all his property was gone and he lived as a tenant in the ruins of one of his beloved gardens. It was here he completed his history of the Ming Dynasty, in part to explain its collapse. For a period of time, he was the sole source of income for more than 20 of his family members. Hard physical works became a part of his daily routine. However, this time period and his culmination of literary production overlapped. He died in 1684 around the age of 88.  Works by Zhang Dai  Zhang Dai was a prolific writer/author. By the age of 50, he had completed more than ten literary works. During his later years, nothing prevented him from writing more on what he found to be a worthy subject.

With a population of 11,730, the municipality of Sant'Antioco it is the island's largest community. It is also the site of ancient Sulci, considered the second city of Sardinia in antiquity. Island of Sant'Antioco Satellite image of Sant'Antioco Sant'Antioco is the second largest island of the Sardinian region, after Sardinia itself, with a surface of ; it is also the fourth largest in Italy after Sicily, Sardinia and Elba. It is located some from Cagliari, to which is connected through the SS126 state road, using a modern bridge. The island is divided between the two municipalities of Sant'Antioco and Calasetta. Other settlements are the small tourist resort of Maladroxia (a frazione of Sant'Antioco municipality) and Cussorgia, part of Calasetta. The coast of the island is in part sandy and in part rocky. The main beaches in the island are Maladroxia and Coaquaddus, in the municipality of Sant'Antioco, and Sotto Torre, Le Saline and Spiaggia Grande in the municipality of Calasetta. History The island of Sant'Antioco was settled at least from the 5th millennium BC (the so-called culture of San Michele of Ozieri), which was based mainly on fishing and agriculture. Typical tombs (called domus de janas) and menhirs belonging to this culture have been found. The island also housed nuraghe civilizations: findings include the nuraghe of Su Niu de su Crobu (\\"Crow's Nest\\"). Mosaic pavement depicting two panthers drinking from a krater In the 8th century BC the Phoenicians founded a new settlement, with the name of Sulky (Punic:). or Solki, of which a tophet (children) necropolis has been excavated. Later (6th century BC) it became a Carthaginian colony, to which another necropolis belongs. The Punic domination ended in the 2nd century BC, when Sulky was conquered by the Romans, who connected it to the mainland through an artificial isthmus. During the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey it sided with the latter, being severely punished after his defeat. During Roman times, it was called Plumbaria, after its lead deposits.Sant' Antioco di Sulcis. The current city name derives from St. Antiochus, evangelizer of the area, who was martyred in 125 AD. After the decline and the end of the Western Roman Empire, Sant'Antioco was a fortified strong point of the Byzantines. It was repeatedly attacked by the Saracens starting from the early 8th century, and gradually abandoned by the inhabitants who fled to the more protected inner area; the island mainly remained important as the end of pilgrimages devoted to St. Antiochus. A new settlement (bidda in Sardinian) was established around 935 by the judge (the local title for lord) of Cagliari, but this also was abandoned after the end of the giudicato. The island was a territory of the Kingdom of Sardinia (created in 1324) and later was acquired by archbishopric of Cagliari (1503) and, in 1758, by the religious Order of SS. Maurizio and Lazzaro. In the 18th century the area began to be repopulated and toward the mid of the century there were 38 houses, 15 workshops, and 164 huts, with some 450 inhabitants. In January‚ÄìMay 1793 the island was occupied by French troops under admiral Laurent Jean Fran√ßois Truguet, and the citizens freed from ecclesiastical taxes.

Although depressed individuals are thought to have a negative cognitive bias that results in recurrent, negative automatic thoughts, maladaptive behaviors, and dysfunctional world beliefs, depressive realism argues not only that this negativity may reflect a more accurate appraisal of the world but also that non-depressed individuals' appraisals are positively biased. Evidence for When participants were asked to press a button and rate the control they perceived they had over whether or not a light turned on, depressed individuals made more accurate ratings of control than non-depressed individuals. Among participants asked to complete a task and rate their performance without any feedback, depressed individuals made more accurate self-ratings than non-depressed individuals. For participants asked to complete a series of tasks, given feedback on their performance after each task, and who self-rated their overall performance after completing all the tasks, depressed individuals were again more likely to give an accurate self-rating than non-depressed individuals. When asked to evaluate their performance both immediately and some time after completing a task, depressed individuals made accurate appraisals both immediately before and after time had passed. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain, depressed patients were shown to be more accurate in their causal attributions of positive and negative social events than non-depressed participants who demonstrated a positive bias. This difference was also reflected in the differential activation of the fronto-temporal network, higher activation for non self-serving attributions in non-depressed participants and for self- serving attributions in depressed patients, and reduced coupling of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex seed region and the limbic areas when depressed patients made self-serving attributions. Evidence against When asked to rate both their performance and the performance of others, non-depressed individuals demonstrated positive bias when rating themselves but no bias when rating others. Depressed individuals conversely showed no bias when rating themselves but a positive bias when rating others. When assessing participant thoughts in public versus private settings, the thoughts of non-depressed individuals were more optimistic in public than private, while depressed individuals were less optimistic in public. When asked to rate their performance immediately after a task and after some time had passed, depressed individuals were more accurate when they rated themselves immediately after the task but were more negative after time had passed whereas non-depressed individuals were positive immediately after and some time after. Although depressed individuals make accurate judgments about having no control in situations where they in fact have no control, this appraisal also carries over to situations where they do have control, suggesting that the depressed perspective is not more accurate overall. One study suggested that in real- world settings, depressed individuals are actually less accurate and more overconfident in their predictions about the future than their non-depressed peers. Participants' attributional accuracy may also be more related to their overall attributional style rather than the presence and severity of their depressive symptoms. Criticism of the evidence Some have argued that the evidence is not more conclusive because no standard for reality exists, the diagnoses are dubious, and the results may not apply to the real world. Because many studies rely on self-report of depressive symptoms and self- reports are known to be biased, the diagnosis of depression in these studies may not be valid, necessitating the use of other objective measures. Due to most of these studies using designs that do not necessarily approximate real- world phenomena, the external validity of the depressive realism hypothesis is unclear. There is also concern that the depressive realism effect is merely a byproduct of the depressed person being in a situation that agrees with their negative bias.

He is notable for making one of only two life masks of United States President Abraham Lincoln. In 1867 he helped establish the Chicago Academy of Design and served as its president until 1878. He made several large monumental sculptures, including the tomb of the politician Stephen A. Douglas, and statues of American Civil War figures. Biography Life mask of Abraham Lincoln. Volk was born at Wellstown (now Wells), Hamilton County, New York to Garrett and Elizabeth (Gesner) Volk. He first followed the trade of a marble cutter with his father in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the family moved. Marriage and family Before 1855 Volk married Emily Clarissa King Barlow, daughter of Honor (Douglas) and Dr. Jonathan King Barlow of Bethany, New York. Her maternal cousin, Stephen A. Douglas, a nationally known politician who ran against Republican Abraham Lincoln as the Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1860. Their son Stephen A. Douglas Volk (1856‚Äì1935) as an adult became notable as a figure and portrait painter. He studied under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me in Paris. Later he helped establish the Minneapolis School of Design. Career Bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln by Leonard Volk, 1860, El Paso Museum of Art In 1848 Volk moved west and opened an artist's studio in St Louis, Missouri. From 1855-1857, Stephen A. Douglas, his wife's cousin, supported the family's travel to Rome so that Volk could pursue additional study. Returning to the United States in 1857, Volk and his family settled in the booming city of Chicago, where he helped to establish the Chicago Academy of Design, precursor to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. For eight years, he served as its director and taught numerous students, including Elbridge Ayer Burbank, who became noted for his more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans. In 1860 Volk made a life mask of Abraham Lincoln. Only one other was made, by Clark Mills in 1865. In the early part of spring 1860, during Lincoln's visit to Chicago, Volk asked him to sit for a bust. The artist decided to start by doing a life mask. Lincoln found the process of letting wet plaster dry on his face, followed by a skin-stretching removal process, \\"anything but agreeable\\". But he maintained good humor, and was pleased with the final bust. He declared it \\"the animal himself\\". Volk later used the life mask and bust of 1860 as the basis for other versions of Lincoln, including a full-size statue. The life mask was also studied by other artists, such as Daniel Chester French. In mid-May 1860, Volk went to Springfield to present the Lincolns with the completed cabinet bust. He had just received the nomination as presidential candidate for the Republican Party. The following day Volk asked Lincoln to allow a casting of both his hands, for use in other sculptural works. Volk wanted Lincoln to hold something to simulate grasping a document in his right hand. Lincoln came back from his tool shed with a whittled piece of broom handle. The casting for Lincoln's right hand was made as he held the broom handle. Lincoln's left hand was cast slightly closed but empty. Stephen A.

He was perhaps the first Western explorer of the region which is now encompassed by the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas. Delavay was born in Les Gets, Haute-Savoie, in 1834. As a missionary for Missions Etrang√®res de Paris (Foreign Missions of Paris) he was sent to China in 1867, serving first in Guangdong, then moving to north- western Yunnan. While in France in 1881, on a break from his duties, Delavay met the natural history collector and fellow missionary P√®re Armand David, who had made his final collecting expedition in China in the 1870s. David encouraged Delavay to continue his collecting work and send specimens to the Paris Museum of Natural History. In 1888 he contracted bubonic plague; he survived the initial onslaught of the disease, but never fully recovered. This did not stop his explorations, however, eventually he travelled to Hong Kong to recuperate, collecting plants all the way. It was while in Hong Kong that he discovered what is now the territories emblem, the Hong Kong orchid tree Bauhinia √ó blakeana. By 1891 it was clear that a more drastic cure was needed, so Delavay returned to France in hopes of gaining a full recovery. Unable to stay away, he returned to China in 1893 and continued his collections, adding another 1550 plants to his already impressive total, but in 1895 he finally succumbed to his illness, and died in Yunnan province aged 61. Legacy Delavay was an avid plant collector, sending over 200,000 herbarium specimens back to France, from which numerous new genera and over 1,500 new species were described, many by Adrien Ren√© Franchet of the Paris Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle. Eponymy Delavay is commemorated in the names of several plants, including Delavay's Fir Abies delavayi, Delavay's Magnolia Magnolia delavayi and Delavay's Peony Paeonia delavayi.

It was published anonymously in 1797, and did not appear under the author's real name until 1856, 16 years after Foster's death. It was one of the best-selling novels of its time and was reprinted eight times between 1824 and 1828. A fictionalized account of the much-publicized death of a socially elite Connecticut woman after giving birth to a stillborn, illegitimate child at a roadside tavern, Foster's novel highlights the social conditions that lead to the downfall of an otherwise well-educated and socially adept woman. List of characters * Eliza Wharton‚Äî the protagonist of the novel who, following the death of her fianc√© is pursued by two men: Reverend J. Boyer and Major Peter Sanford. Her free spirit and lack of commitment to the male sex bestow her the term \\"coquette.\\" Her coquettish nature eventually leads to her demise. * Rev. J. Boyer ‚Äî the first of Eliza's suitors. He is a safe and modest man who wishes to have Eliza's hand in marriage, yet his predictable nature is not appealing enough. Ultimately, Eliza's lack of sincerity and commitment causes him to end his pursuit of her. * Major Peter Sanford ‚Äî the second of Eliza's suitors. He is a womanizer who provides excitement for Eliza yet shows no signs of future commitment. However, he eventually marries another woman; this does not prevent Eliza from further continuing her relationship with him. * Lucy Freeman ‚Äî Eliza's best friend, from whom she often seeks advice. Lucy's disapproval of Eliza's decisions is evident in her letters. During the novel, she gets married; thus, her name is changed to Lucy Sumner. * Charles Deighton-Sanford's primary confidant. Sanford expresses his thoughts in his letters to Charles. * Mr. T. Selby ‚Äî Reverend Boyer's primary confidant. He expresses his blatant disapproval of Eliza in his responses. * Nancy Sanford‚Äî Major Peter Sanford's wife. Although not as attractive as Eliza, her wealth compensates. She is briefly mentioned in Major Sanford's letters. * Gen. and Mrs. Richman ‚Äî Relatives of Eliza (Mrs. Richman is Eliza's cousin). The couple provides her with a place to stay upon the loss of her fianc√©. While they truly look out for her best interests, their advice is often overlooked. * Julia Granby ‚Äî a free-spirit and one of Eliza's closest friends. She comes to comfort Eliza during her time of despair. * Mrs. Wharton ‚Äî Eliza's widowed mother. Coping with the loss of her husband, she is happy when Eliza returns home but distressed to see her in such a disdainful state. Plot summary The story is about Eliza Wharton, the daughter of a clergyman. At the beginning of the novel she has just been released from an unwanted marriage by the death of her betrothed, the Rev. Haly, also a clergyman, whom Eliza nursed during his final days in her own home. After this experience, she decides she wants friendship and independence. After a short period of time living with friends, she is courted by two men. One, Boyer, is a respected but rather boring clergyman, whom all of her friends and her mother recommend she accept in marriage. The other, Sanford, is an aristocratic libertine, who has no intention to marry but determines not to let another man have Eliza. Because of her indecision and her apparent preference for the libertine Sanford, Boyer eventually gives up on her, deciding that she will not make a suitable wife. Sanford also disappears from her life and marries another woman, Nancy, for her fortune. Eliza eventually decides that she really loved Boyer and wants him back. Unfortunately for Eliza, Boyer has already decided to marry Maria Selby, a relation of Boyer's friend. Sanford later reappears married, but is able to seduce the depressed Eliza. They have a hidden affair for some time until, overcome by guilt and unwilling to face her family and friends, Eliza arranges to escape from her home. Like the real-life Elizabeth Whitman, she dies due to childbirth complications and is buried by strangers. Mrs. Wharton (Eliza's mother) and all of Eliza's friends are deeply saddened by her death. Sanford, too, is devastated by her death. In a letter to his friend, Charles Deighton, he expresses his regret at his wretched behavior. Genre and narrative form Together, The Coquette and Charlotte Temple by Susanna Rowson (1791) have been called \\"the canonical representations of seduction novels by women\\". Written in epistolary form, this novel allows the reader to directly engage with the events central to the plot by entering the minds of the characters. The letters serve as windows into the thoughts of the writers, creating an intimate connection. The reader also benefits from an unbiased perspective, since it is the culmination of different character's input that creates the story. The epistolary form is also an intriguing way to captivate an audience. Reading letters addressed to others has a feeling akin to eavesdropping; it exposes thoughts otherwise not publicly known. Sources Foster's tale was loosely based on the biography of Elizabeth Whitman (1752‚Äì88), whose death at 37 in a roadside tavern after giving birth to a stillborn child was widely publicized in the New England papers nine years before the novel's publication. Like her fictional counterpart, Whitman was accomplished, vivacious, and widely admired. She is known to have been engaged to the Rev. Joseph Howe (prototype for Foster's Rev. Hale), and then later to the Rev. Joseph Buckminster (fictionalized as Rev. Boyer), but she married neither. Whitman attracted the attention of the poet Joel Barlow (1754‚Äì1812), who wrote flirtatious letters to Whitman while also courting another woman, Ruth Baldwin, whom he eventually married. Whitman, under the name \\"Mrs. Walker,\\" died at the Bell Tavern in Danvers, Massachusetts, after giving birth to a stillborn baby. Biographers are still not certain of the identity of her lover, who is referred to only as \\"Fidelio\\" in her letters. Her death notices, published in a variety of New England newspapers in 1788, quickly provoked moral lectures for young women. Whitman's life was turned into a moral allegory, ministers and journalists blaming her demise on her reading of romance novels,Massachusetts Centinel. 20 September 1788. which gave her improper ideas and turned her into a coquette. Foster responded with The Coquette, which offered a more sympathetic portrayal of Whitman and the restrictions placed on middle-class women in early American society. The title page to The Coquette announces the tale as \\"A Novel Founded on Fact,\\" testifying both to the novel's basis on newspaper accounts of Whitman's death, as well as the prevailing suspicion of novelistic fiction in the early Republic as potentially corrupting, especially to the female mind.Cherniavsky, Eva. \\"Foster, Hannah Webster,\\" American National Biography Feb. 2000. (American National Biography access needed) However, the novel can be argued to dignify Elizabeth's character by playing down the sensationalism of the many newspaper accounts of her death, which Cathy N. Davidson has argued were \\"the stuff of good rumor, of gossip, of sentimental novels.\\" Elizabeth Whitman's graveElizabeth Whitman's grave, after her widely publicized death, became a tourist attraction in Peabody, Massachusetts where it still remains. The original tombstone has been chipped away by tourists seeking souvenirs. To the right of the remnants of this stone is a replication of the tombstone described in Foster's novel on which the inscription reads: :This humble stone, in memory of ELIZABETH WHITMAN, :Is inscribed by her weeping friends, :To whom she endeared herself :By uncommon tenderness and affection. :Endowed with superior genius and accomplishments, :She was still more distinguished by humility and benevolence. :Let Candour throw a veil over her frailties, :For great was her charity to others. :She lived an example of calm resignation, :And sustained the last painful scene, :Far from every friend. :Her departure was on the 25th of July, A.D. 1788. :In the 37th year of her age; :The tears of strangers watered her grave. The new tombstone was erected in attempts to revive the community's interest in the tale of Elizabeth Whitman and Foster's novel. It is now included on the Literacy Trail of Massachusetts. With the growing popularity of Foster's novel, the true Elizabeth Whitman and the fictional Eliza Wharton became melded into one and are barely differentiable by most readers today.http://www.common-place.org/vol-09/no-03/waterman Interpretation and criticism The Coquette received a revival of critical attention during the late twentieth century. It is often praised for its intelligent portrayal of the contrast between individualism vs. social conformity and passion vs. reason. It has also been studied for its relationship to political ideologies of the early American republic and its portrayal of the emerging middle class. Foster's tale has been read on the one hand as a \\"novel for providing a subversive message about the ways in which the lives of women even of the elite are subject to narrow cultural constraints\\" and, on the other hand, as an instructive novel that \\"comes down on the side of the ideology of Republican motherhood and the women's sphere, a sphere that celebrated those women who with appropriate sentiment and rationality accepted their \\"place\\" in the world. Foster's epistolary narrative allows for the development of multiple points of view and for a variety of readings. Rather than being presented as a one-sided coquette, the development of Eliza's character through her letter writing allows for a reading of Eliza as both \\"victim\\" and \\"transgressor\\" of society's norms. Cathy N. Davidson argues that The Coquette is not merely a novel about the evils of sin and seduction, but rather \\"a remarkably detailed assessment of the marital possibilities facing late-eighteenth-century women of the middle or upper- middle classes.\\" Davidson notes the centrality of Foster's novel in \\"countering received ideas on women's circumscribed power and authority,\\" positioning The Coquette as \\"an important voice in the debate on women's role in the Republic.\\" In her exploration of the early American novel, Davidson uses the contradictions between Foster's novel and the moral accounts of Elizabeth Whitman's death to explore the emergence of the early American sentimental novel: > Eliza Wharton sins and dies. Her death can convey the conservative moral > that many critics of the time demanded. Yet the circumstances of that death > seem designed to tease the reader into thought. It is in precisely these > interstices‚Äîthe distjunctions between the conventional and the radical > readings of the plot ‚Äì that the early American sentimental novel flourishes. > It is in the irresolution of Eliza Wharton's dilemma that the novel, as a > genre, differentiates itself from the tract stories of Elizabeth Whitman in > which the novel is grounded and which it ultimately transcends. In Redefining the Political Novel, Sharon M. Harris responds to Cathy Davidson's work by arguing that The Coquette can be understood as a political novel; she writes, \\"By recognizing and satirizing, first, the political systems that create women's social realisms and, second, the language used to convey those systems to the broader culture, Foster exposes the sexist bases of the new nation's political ideologies.\\" Countering Davidson and Harris, Thomas Joudrey has argued that the novel fortifies obedience to a patriarchal conception of marriage. In its sustained denigration of fancy and passion, The Coquette \\"deprives the imagined readers not merely of actualized resistance but also of the very mental capacities that perceive injury and formulate alternatives to their oppression.\\"Joudrey, Thomas. \\"Maintaining Stability: Fancy and Passion in The Coquette. The New England Quarterly 36.1 (2013): 60-88. One aspect of The Coquette that has garnered significant critical attention is the role of female friendship within the text. In Perfecting Friendship: Politics and Affiliation in Early American Literature, Ivy Schweitzer discusses the \\"affective failures\\" of Eliza Wharton's female friends and argues that while Eliza can be understood as \\"the champion of an inclusive, even feminist 'civic republicanism,'\\" her friends belong to \\"the female 'chorus' [that] presages the more rigid separation of the sexes and women's exile from the social to the domestic sphere ushered in by liberalism.\\" Claire C. Pettengill reads female friendship within The Coquette in terms of sisterhood, which she argues \\"[involved] a kind of support network that helped a woman establish her identity in opposition to both social and parental authority in an era where both were increasingly challenged.\\" At the same time, Pettengill insists that the \\"emotional-disciplinary circuit that reinforces sisterhood is not operating at full (theoretical) capacity.\\" That is, even though Eliza discusses her life with her friends, they do not fully reciprocate; instead, they respond primarily by criticizing her actions and warning her against further wrongdoing. Pettengill ultimately arrives at the conclusion that \\"The novel's bifurcated view of sisterhood, then, reveals some of the ways in which the new nation's uneasiness over changing economic and social relations, in particular the tension between individual and group interests, spelled itself out in terms of the function of women.\\" Other critical studies of The Coquette include Dorothy Z. Baker's work, which argues that \\"Eliza's struggle to control her life begins with the struggle to control language, the language of society that dictates her identity and conscribes her life.\\" Additionally, C. Leiren Mower makes the case that Eliza \\"reworks Lockean theories of labor and ownership as a means of authorizing proprietary control over her body's commerce in the social marketplace. Instead of accepting her social and legal status as another's personal property, Eliza publicly performs her dissent as visible evidence of the legitimacy of her proprietary claims.\\" In 1798, Foster published her second novel, The Boarding School, which was never reprinted and not nearly as popular as The Coquette.

An otherworldly woman may invite the hero into the Otherworld by offering an apple or a silver apple branch, or a ball of thread to follow as it unwinds.Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii. The Otherworld is usually called Annwn in Welsh mythology and Avalon in Arthurian legend. In Irish mythology it has several names, including T√≠r na n√ìg, Mag Mell and Emain Ablach. In Irish myth there is also Tech Duinn, where the souls of the dead gather. Irish mythology Ois√≠n and Niamh approaching a palace in T√≠r na n√ìg, illustration by Stephen Reid in T. W. Rolleston's The High Deeds of Finn (1910) In Irish mythology, the Otherworld has various names. Names of the Otherworld, or places within it, include T√≠r nAill (\\"the other land\\"),MacCulloch, J. A. (1911). The Religion of the Ancient Celts. p.362.

Otherworlds: Fantasy and History in Medieval Literature. Oxford University Press, 2015. p.34 Mag Argatn√©l (\\"the silver-cloud plain\\"), Mag Ildathach (\\"the multicoloured plain\\"), Mag C√≠uin (\\"the gentle plain\\"), and Emain Ablach (possibly \\"isle of apples\\"). It is described as a supernatural realm where there is everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy, and where time moves differently. It is the dwelling place of the gods (the Tuatha D√© Danann) as well as certain heroes and ancestors. It was probably similar to the Elysium of Greek mythology and both may have a shared origin in ancient Proto-Indo-European religion. The Otherworld is elusive, but various mythical heroes‚Äîsuch as C√∫chulainn, Fionn and Bran‚Äîvisit it either through chance or after being invited by one of its residents. In Irish myth and later folklore, the festivals of Samhain and Beltane are liminal times, when contact with the Otherworld was more likely. In the tales, the Otherworld is often reached by entering ancient burial mounds, such as those at Br√∫ na B√≥inne and Cnoc Meadha. These were known as s√≠dhe (\\"Otherworld dwellings\\") and were the dwellings of the gods, later called the aos s√≠ or daoine s√≠ (\\"Otherworld folk\\"). Irish mythology says that the gods retreated into the s√≠dhe when the Gaels (Milesians) took Ireland from them. In some tales, the Otherworld is reached by going under the waters of pools, lakes, or the sea, or else by crossing the western sea. In Irish Immrama (\\"voyage\\") tales, a beautiful young Otherworld woman often approaches the hero and sings to him of this happy land. Sometimes she offers him an apple, or the promise of her love in exchange for his help in battle. He follows her, and they journey over the sea together and are seen no more. Their journey may be in a boat of glass, in a chariot, or on horseback (usually upon a white horse, as in the case of the goddess Niamh of the Golden Hair). Sometimes the hero returns after what he believes is a short time, only to find that all his companions are dead and he has actually been away for hundreds of years. Sometimes the hero sets out on a quest, and a magic mist descends upon him. He may find himself before an unusual palace and enter to find a warrior or a beautiful woman who makes him welcome. The woman may be the goddess Fand, the warrior may be Manann√°n mac Lir or Lugh, and after strange adventures the hero may return successfully. However, even when the mortal manages to return to his own time and place, he is forever changed by his contact with the Otherworld. The Otherworld was also seen as a source of authority. In the tale Baile in Sc√°il (\\"the phantom's ecstatic vision\\"), Conn of the Hundred Battles visits an Otherworld hall, where the god Lugh legitimises his kingship and that of his successors. In Irish myth there is another otherworldly realm called Tech Duinn (the \\"House of Donn\\" or \\"House of the Dark One\\").Freitag, Barbara. Hy Brasil: The Metamorphosis of an Island. Rodopi, 2013. pp.98-99, 101 It was believed that the souls of the dead travelled to Tech Duinn; perhaps to remain there forever, or perhaps before reaching their final destination in the Otherworld,MacKillop 1998, pp.147‚Äì9 or before being reincarnated. Donn is portrayed as a god of the dead and ancestor of the Gaels. Tech Duinn is commonly identified with Bull Rock, an islet off the west coast of Ireland which resembles a portal tomb.√ì h√ìg√°in, D√°ith√≠. The Lore of Ireland.

Welsh mythology In Welsh mythology, the Otherworld is usually called Annwn or Annwfn. The Welsh tale of Branwen, daughter of Llyr ends with the survivors of the great battle feasting in the Otherworld, in the presence of the severed head of Bran the Blessed, having forgotten all their suffering and sorrow, and having become unaware of the passage of time.Patrick K. Ford (ed/trans), The Mabinogi and other Medieval Welsh Tales, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1977. Annwn is ruled by the Otherworld kings Arawn and Gwyn ap Nudd.MacKillop 1998, pp.19‚Äì20 In the First Branch of the Welsh tales known as The Mabinogion, entitled Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed, the eponymous prince offends Arawn, ruler of Annwn, by baiting his hunting hounds on a stag that Arawn's dogs had brought down. In recompense, Pwyll swaps places with Arawn for a year and defeats Arawn's enemy Hafgan. Meanwhile, Arawn rules Dyfed. During this year, Pwyll does not sleep with Arawn's wife, earning himself gratitude from Arawn. On his return, Pwyll becomes known by the title Pen Annwn, \\"Head (or Ruler) of Annwn\\". Continental Celtic mythology The Gauls divided the universe into three parts: Albios (\\"heaven, white-world, upper-world\\"), Bitu (\\"world of the living beings\\"), and Dubnos (\\"hell, lower-world, dark-world\\").;; According to Lucan, the Gaulish druids believed that the soul went to an Otherworld, which he calls by the Latin name Orbis alius, before being reincarnated. Graeco- Roman geographers tell us about Celtic belief in islands consecrated to gods and heroes. Among them were Anglesey (M√¥n), off the north coast of Wales, which was the sacred island of the druids of Britain; the Scilly islands, where archaeological remains of proto-historical temples have been found; and some of the Hebrides, which were, in the Gaelic tradition, home of ghosts and demons: on one of them, Skye, the Irish hero C√∫chulainn was taught by the warrior woman Scathach. Byzantine scholar Procopius of Caesarea described the Otherworld of the ancient Gauls. He said it was thought that the land of the dead lay west of Great Britain. The Continental Celtic myths told that once the souls of the dead had left their bodies, they travelled to the northwestern coast of Gaul and took a boat towards Britain. When they crossed the Channel, the souls went to the homes of the fishermen, and knocked desperately at their doors. The fishermen then went out of their houses and led the souls to their destination in ghostly ships. There are still remains of those beliefs in the Breton and Galician traditions. In Brittany, the name Bag an Noz is used to denote those ships who carry the dead to their goal: Anatole Le Braz describes in his book La l√©gende de la mort chez les Bretons armoricains the existence of souls' processions which make their way toward coastal places like Laoual, to start their last travel from there. In Asturian mythology, there are many stories which describe human encounters with xanas, fairies which are dancing around a chief fairy, the Xana Mega, or the \\"Queen of Fairies\\", known as in Galicia. The castro of Altamira is said to hide an enormous underground realm which is ruled by a royal couple, and whose entrance is found some place on the hill.

Sonbhadra is the only district in India which borders four states namely Madhya Pradesh in west, Chhattishgarh in south, Jharkhand in south east and Bihar in the northeast. The district has an area of 6788 km¬≤ and a population of 1,862,559 (2011 census), with a population density of 270 persons per km¬≤. It lies in the extreme southeast of the state, and is bounded by Mirzapur District to the northwest, Chandauli District to the north, Kaimur and Rohtas districts of Bihar state to the northeast, Garhwa district of Jharkhand state to the east, Balrampur District of Chhattisgarh state to the south, and Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh state to the west. The district headquarters is in the town of Robertsganj. Sonbhadra district is an industrial zone and it has much bauxite, limestone, coal, gold, etc. Sonbhadra is called as \\"Energy Capital of India\\" because there are so many power plants. Sonbhadra lies between vindhya and Kaimur hills, and its topology and natural environment prompted First Prime minister of India Pt. Jawarharlal Nehru to refer to Sonbhadra as The Switzerland of India. Jawaharlal Nehru at inauguration of Rihand Dam In 2017 Uttar Pradesh's chief minister Yogi Adityanath recognised Sonbhadra as a tourist mecca in Purvanchal region and further promoted by Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department. In February 2020, a PTI news report incorrectly claimed that Geological Survey of India has found 3,000 tonnes of gold deposits in Sonbhadra district. PTI later clarified on Twitter that the GSI had told PTI that there had been no such discovery of large gold deposits in the district. History The Valley of Son and Belan Rivers abounds in caves which were the earliest dwellings of the primeval inhabitants. This area had been the centre of activities of pre-historic man which is evident from the rock paintings (pre-historic cave art) found in abundance in this region. These paintings are of the periods ranging from Mesolithic to Paleolithic ages. Panchmukhi Hill, Robertsganj in Sonbhadra Based on evidence from religious and cultural perspectives of Ramayana and the Mahabharat, Huyen found here is the cultural symbol. By Jarasandh many rulers in the Mahabharat were maintained prisoner here. Sonbhadra, whose ancient name was Gramputra or Gupt Kashi, was built by the ancient king Putrak for his queen Paatali. It is said that 'Bhars' had settlements along with Chero, Searis and Kharwar communities in the district up to 5th century there was the rule of Chandel Rajput kings on Vijaygarh Fort. This district was famous as second Kashi during 11th to 13th centuries. In the 9th century B.C., the Brahmadutt dynasty was subdivided by Nagas. Kushan and Nagas also held supremacy over this region before the advent of the Gupta period. After the death of Harshvardhan in the latter half of the 7th century, it remained under the control of the Gurjara-Pratihars till 1025 before they were driven out by Mahmud of Ghazni. This area was under the administration of various Governors of Mughal emperors. Some of the forts such as Agori Fort were under the control of Madan Shah. During the 18th century, the district came under the control of the Narayan rulers of Benares State, who built or occupied several fortresses in the district. In the decade after 1775, the British took over administrative control of most of the territory of the rajas of Benares. The British district of Mirzapur included present-day Mirzapur and Sonbhadra districts, with all of present-day Sonbhadra district included in Robertsganj tehsil. On 4 March 1989, Sonbhadra district was divided from Mirzapur district.

Paragnas of Sonbhadra Agori Barhar a impartible estate, it originally comprised the present districts of Sonbhadra and part of Mirzapur district. It was divided into two parganas of Agori, which was 18,477 km2 and Barhar, which was 11,290 km2 in area, thus making it the largest estate in area in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Chandel Rajput Raja Paramardideva of Mahoba, ancestor of the family and contemporary of Raja Prithviraj III of Delhi, who attacked Mahoba as the Raja was the ally of Raja Jaichand of Kannauj, and occupied it for a time. Raja Paramardi Deva fled for his life with his friends and family, and though Mahoba was re-occupied by the Raja with the help of Jaichand of Kannauj, the glory of the capital never returned. During this time one of the sons of Raja Paramardi Deva, called Ashajit, fled eastwards in the turmoil that followed. His sons or grand sons called Barimal and Bharimal, captured Agori from the Kaharwar Raja and made them selves the independent rulers of Agori and Barhar. The elder brother Barimal took the kingdom of Agori and Barhar, and the younger brother Bharimal became the independent ruler of Bardi( Princely state ruled by Chandel -Rajput ruler). Within this zamindari, sixteen taluqas have been assigned for the maintenance of the Babus (collateral agnates).

(April 24, 2017). Autopsy: 'Happy Days' actress Erin Moran likely died of cancer. usatoday.com. Retrieved April 27, 2017. \\"Erin Moran-Fleischmann, who was best known for playing Joanie Cunningham ...\\" (October 18, 1960 ‚Äì April 22, 2017) was an American actress, best known for playing Joanie Cunningham on the television sitcom Happy Days and its spin-off Joanie Loves Chachi. Early life Erin Marie Moran was born on October 18, 1960, in Burbank, California in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and raised in nearby Los Angeles in the North Hollywood district. She was the second youngest of six children born to Sharon and Edward Moran. Her father was a finance manager, and her interest in acting was supported by her mother, who signed her with a talent agent when she was 5 years old. Two of her brothers are also actors, John Moran and Tony Moran, the latter of whom played Michael Myers in the movie Halloween (1978). Career Moran as Joanie Cunningham in 1976 Moran's first acting role was at the age of 5, in a television commercial for First Federal Bank. At the age of 6, she was cast as Jenny Jones in the television series Daktari, which ran from 1966 to 1969. She made her feature-film debut in How Sweet It Is! (1968) with Debbie Reynolds, and made regular appearances on The Don Rickles Show in 1972, and guest appearances in The Courtship of Eddie's Father, My Three Sons, Bearcats!, Family Affair and in The Waltons, in an episode titled \\"The Song\\", in 1975. She also appeared in the television series Gunsmoke. In 1974, at the age of 13, Moran was cast to play her best-known role, Joanie Cunningham on the sitcom Happy Days, the feisty younger sister of Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard). Moran continued the role in 1982, in the short-lived spin-off series Joanie Loves Chachi, alongside Scott Baio, although she later stated that she had only reluctantly agreed to star in the series; she would have preferred to remain with Happy Days. She won the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actress in a New Television Series for her role. After Joanie Loves Chachi cancellation in 1983, she returned to Happy Days for its final season. In 1983, Moran said in an interview that the Happy Days producers had pressured her to change from about the age of 15: they had \\"suddenly wanted me to lose weight and become this sexy thing.‚Äù In the following years, Moran made several other television guest appearances, including The Love Boat, Murder, She Wrote, and Diagnosis: Murder, and starred opposite Edward Albert in the cult sci-fi horror film Galaxy of Terror (1981). In 2008, she was a contestant on VH1's reality show Celebrity Fit Club, two years later, she made an appearance in the independent comedy feature Not Another B Movie (2010). In 2013, despite reports that she would be reunited with Happy Days co-stars Henry Winkler, Ron Howard, and Scott Baio in the fourth season of Arrested Development, she did not appear in the revamped Netflix series. Happy Days lawsuit On April 19, 2011, Moran, three of her Happy Days co-stars‚ÄîDon Most, Anson Williams, and Marion Ross‚Äîand the estate of Tom Bosley, who died in 2010, filed a $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS, which owns the show. The suit claimed that cast members had not been paid merchandising revenues owed under their contracts. Revenues included those from show-related items such as comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunch boxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards, and DVDs with cast members' likenesses on the box covers. Their contracts entitled the actors to be paid five percent of the net proceeds of merchandising in the event that a single actor's likeness was used, and half that amount in the event that the cast members were pictured in a group. CBS said it owed the actors between $8,500 and $9,000 each, most of it from slot machine revenues, but the group said they were owed millions. The lawsuit was initiated after Ross was informed by a friend playing slots at a casino of a Happy Days machine on which players won the jackpot when five Marion Rosses were rolled. In October 2011, a judge rejected the group's claim of fraud, thereby eliminating the possibility of recouping millions of dollars in damages. On June 5, 2012, a judge denied a motion to dismiss filed by CBS, which meant the case would go to trial on July 17 if not settled by then. In July 2012, the actors settled their lawsuit with CBS; each received a payment of $65,000 and a promise from CBS to continue honoring the terms of their contracts. Personal life and death In 1987, Moran married Rocky Ferguson; they divorced in 1993. Later that year, she married Steven Fleischmann. After Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi were canceled, Moran moved from Los Angeles to the California mountains. She said in 1988 that she suffered from depression and was unable to gain acting roles. Moran confirmed news reports that her California home was foreclosed in 2010, following media claims that she had been served eviction papers and moved into her mother-in-law's trailer home in Indiana. In 2017, Variety magazine said she \\"had fallen on hard times in recent years. She was reportedly kicked out of her trailer park home in Indiana because of her hard-partying ways.\\" On April 22, 2017, authorities in Corydon, Indiana, were alerted about an unresponsive female, later identified as Moran. She was later pronounced dead at the age of 56. An autopsy report from the Harrison County coroner indicated the cause of death to be complications of stage four squamous cell carcinoma of the throat; toxicology testing showed that no illegal narcotics were involved in her death, and no illegal substances were found in Moran's home. Moran's husband, in an open letter released through her co-star Scott Baio, confirmed that she had first experienced symptoms of throat cancer around Thanksgiving 2016 and deteriorated rapidly from that point, and that the facilities that had unsuccessfully attempted to treat her cancer had not made anyone aware of how badly the cancer had metastasized.

Criticism In 2013, a 20-year-old Indian student studying in the US, Debarghya Das, claimed in his personal blog to have downloaded the ICSE scores for over 100,000 students by scraping. His analysis of the data showed interesting patterns in the marking system, suggesting that the marks were rounded off with no student getting under 33 marks out of a possible 100. The reason for this was reportedly attributed to moderation; a practice also followed by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), it involved tweaking candidates' marks to account for paper variances.

Devaney (April 13, 1915 ‚Äì May 9, 1997) was a college football coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Wyoming from 1957 to 1961 and at the University of Nebraska from 1962 to 1972, compiling a career record of . Devaney's Nebraska Cornhuskers won consecutive national championships in 1970 and 1971 and three consecutive Orange Bowls. Devaney also served as the athletic director at Nebraska from 1967 to 1993, and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1981. He died of a heart attack at age 82 and is buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Lincoln. Playing and early coaching career Devaney graduated from Alma College in 1939, where he played end on the football team. Devaney coached high school football in Michigan at Big Beaver, Keego Harbor, Saginaw, and Alpena, before joining the Michigan State Spartans staff as an assistant coach under Biggie Munn and continuing under Duffy Daugherty. Head coach=Wyoming Devaney's first college head coaching job was at the University of Wyoming, where he went in five seasons (1957‚Äì1961). The Cowboys won the Sun Bowl in his second season and won or shared the Skyline Conference title in his final four seasons in Laramie. Devaney was released from his contract by the university's board of trustees in and was hired at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln at an annual salary of $17,000. Nebraska Devaney was the fourth choice of Nebraska's athletic director, Tippy Dye. Utah's Ray Nagel and Utah State's John Ralston had turned down the job. Michigan State coach Duffy Daugherty also turned down Dye, but recommended Devaney, his former assistant, for the Cornhuskers. When Devaney balked at leaving Wyoming for Nebraska, it was Daugherty who convinced him to accept the position because he could potentially win a national title at Nebraska, a goal that Wyoming was very unlikely to obtain. Devaney joined Nebraska in 1962 and immediately reestablished the program as a force in the Big Eight Conference. Prior to Devaney's arrival, Nebraska football had fallen on hard times with seven consecutive losing seasons. The 1961 team under Bill Jennings went 3‚Äì6‚Äì1 overall and 2‚Äì5 in conference. After a winning tradition up until the early 1940s, Nebraska had only two winning seasons in the two decades preceding Devaney's arrival.Nebraska Yearly Totals , cfbdatawarehouse.com; accessed June 28, 2015. Devaney engineered an immediate turnaround with a record in 1962 that included a victory in the Gotham Bowl at Yankee Stadium over the Miami Hurricanes. It was the first of forty consecutive winning seasons for Nebraska. Devaney followed this up with an even better season the next year, including a perfect 7‚Äì0 record in the Big Eight to claim the conference title and an Orange Bowl victory over Auburn. His success continued through 1966, with records of 9‚Äì2, 10‚Äì1, and 9‚Äì2, bringing his record at Nebraska to in his first five seasons. This had so revived Nebraska football that Memorial Stadium was enlarged significantly by enclosing both ends. For the first time, Nebraska was on television once or twice a year and fans all over the state sat down to watch the Bob Devaney TV show each week, in which he used his folksy manner to review the tape of the game for all of the fans who hadn't seen it in person.https://hailvarsity.com/s/8130/two-platoon-football-one-way-or-another- ushered-in-the-blackshirts Consecutive 6‚Äì4 seasons followed in 1967 and 1968; allegedly known as a drinker, Devaney became subject to a whispering campaign about whether he had peaked. However, he had brought in an innovative offensive thinker as an assistant coach, Tom Osborne. Devaney and Osborne revamped the offensive scheme, an I formation with an unbalanced line, and upgraded the recruiting effort. Nebraska began the 1969 season at 2‚Äì2 start and in its fifth game needed a last-minute comeback at home to beat a Kansas team that finished the season with only one win. But the Huskers kept winning and concluded the regular season then routed Georgia in the Sun Bowl. This set the stage for the highlight of Devaney's coaching career. =National championships= The 1970 Nebraska team returned most of the key offensive starters from the previous year, and added sophomore Johnny Rodgers, an explosive punt returner and wide receiver, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1972 as a senior. Nebraska tied USC in Los Angeles early in the season and was ranked #3 going into the Orange Bowl against LSU. A late touchdown by quarterback Jerry Tagge gave the Huskers a 17‚Äì12 victory to finish the season This secured a share of the national championship, after the other two undefeated teams in the nation, Texas and Ohio State, lost their bowl games earlier in the day. The final AP Poll, conducted after the bowl games were played, picked Nebraska while the final UPI Poll, released in early December before the bowl games, had Texas first with With most of its key players back and its defense vastly improved in 1971, Nebraska rolled through the first ten games. The top-ranked Huskers met unbeaten #2 Oklahoma in Norman on Thanksgiving Day in the Game of the Century, one of the most celebrated games in college football history. A late touchdown by tailback Jeff Kinney gave the Huskers a hard-fought victory. When Nebraska crushed unbeaten Alabama in the Orange Bowl to finish the Cornhuskers were said by many to be the greatest team in college football In fact, the Huskers defeated the teams ranked second, third, and fourth in the final AP Poll: Oklahoma, Colorado, and Alabama.1970 College AP Poll cfbdatawarehouse.com =Final season= Devaney coached one more year in 1972 and expectations were high for a third straight national title. Although a disappointing loss to UCLA at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum opened the season, the Huskers finished with a 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 record. The loss to UCLA ended Nebraska's 32-game unbeaten streak, which dated back nearly three years to October 11, 1969, when they lost at Missouri. Although the Cornhuskers tied Iowa State and lost by three points to Oklahoma in Lincoln in November, the season ended with a 40‚Äì6 victory over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, the Huskers' third consecutive victory in that bowl game. Nebraska finished the 1972 season ranked #4 in the AP Poll. In addition, Johnny Rodgers was selected as the winner of the Heisman Trophy. The UPI Coaches' Poll, released before the bowls, had Nebraska at #9. Following the 1972 season, Devaney stepped down as head coach at age 57 and hired his prot√©g√© to succeed him, offensive coordinator Tom Osborne. Devaney's overall record at Nebraska was 101‚Äì20‚Äì2 () in 11 seasons, with nine bowl appearances and two national championships. His teams won or shared eight Big Eight Conference titles. His record in his final three seasons was 32‚Äì2‚Äì2 (), and his career college head coaching record at Wyoming and Nebraska was 136‚Äì30‚Äì7 () in 16 seasons. Nebraska athletic director Devaney served as athletic director at Nebraska from 1967 to 1993 and as athletic director emeritus until 1996.

(2007). He was the father of the graphic artist M. C. Escher and the geologist Berend George Escher. Career Escher was hired by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor from September 1873 to July 1878, along with fellow Dutch civil engineers Johannis de Rijke and Cornelis Johannes van Doorn. During his stay in Japan, he designed and supervised the restoration of the Yodo river (Osaka), and built a harbour in Mikuni in Fukui prefecture. After returning to the Netherlands, he worked in Maastricht. During this time, he recorded in his diary his difficulty as a Protestant in finding a suitable marriage partner in Roman Catholic Maastricht who would also be able to satisfy his equation v = 1/2m + 10, where v was the age of the woman, and m the age of the husband. In 1882, Escher married Charlotte Marie Hartitzsch, with whom he had two sons. He became a widower in 1885, and in 1892 married Sara Gleichman, with whom he had three more sons. Escher worked as a hydraulic engineer in Leeuwarden. In 1903 the family moved to Arnhem.

This semiaquatic creature is found in and near freshwater streams and lakes from Mexico through Central and South America to Argentina and is the most aquatic living marsupial (the lutrine opossum also has semiaquatic habits). It is also the only living marsupial in which both sexes have a pouch. The thylacine, commonly referred to as the Tasmanian tiger, also exhibited this trait, but it is now believed to be extinct. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows, emerging after dusk to swim and search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank. Origin of the name The local name for the water opossum, \\"yapok\\", probably comes from the name of the Oyapok River in French Guiana. Physical appearance Skull of a water opossum The water opossum is a small opossum, 27-32.5 cm long, with a 36‚Äì40 cm long tail. The fur is in a marbled grey and black pattern, while the muzzle, eyestripe, and crown are all black. A light band runs across the forehead anterior to the ears, which are rounded and naked. There are sensory facial bristles in tufts above each eye, as well as whiskers. The water opossum's tail, furred and black at the base, is yellow or white at its end. The hindfeet of the water opossum are webbed, while the forefeet (\\"hands\\") are not. The forefeet can be used to feel for and grab prey as the animal swims, propelled by its tail and webbed back feet.Fernandez, Fernando Antonio dos Santos, et al. \\"Natural history of the water opossum Chironectes minimus: a review.\\" Oecologia Australis 19.1 (2015). Unlike other didelphids, the water opossum does not have a cloaca.Nogueira, Jos√© Carlos, et al. \\"Morphology of the male genital system of Chironectes minimus and comparison to other didelphid marsupials.\\" Journal of mammalogy 85.5 (2004): 834-841. Aquatic adaptations The water opossum has several adaptations for its watery lifestyle. It has short, dense fur, which is water-repellent. The broad hindfeet are webbed and are used for propulsion through water, moving with alternate strokes. They are symmetrical as well, which distributes force equally along both borders of the webbing; this increases the efficiency of the water opossum's movement through the water. The water opossum's long tail also aids in swimming. Being a marsupial and at the same time an aquatic animal, the water opossum has evolved a way to protect its young while swimming. A strong ring of muscle makes the pouch (which opens to the rear) watertight, so the young remain dry, even when the mother is totally immersed in water. The male also has a pouch (although not as watertight as the female's), where he places his genitalia before swimming. This is thought to prevent them from becoming tangled in aquatic vegetation and is probably helpful in streamlining the animal as well. Reproduction Water opossums mate in December and a litter of 1-5 young is born 12 to 14 days later in the nest. By 22 days the offspring are beginning to show some fur, and by 40 days or so their eyes are open, their bodies protruding from the mother's pouch. At 48 days of age, the young opossums detach from the nipples, but they still nurse and sleep with the mother. Fossil record The water opossum seems to have a history dating as far back as to the Pliocene Epoch. Holocene subfossil fragments of Chironectes have been discovered in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Also, there are fossil specimens from the late Pleistocene-Recent cave deposits in Minas Gerais, Brazil, as well as from the late Pliocene in Entre R√≠os Province, Argentina.

Simmons is originally from Newfoundland and Labrador where he was an active politician for many years. He was later based at the Vancouver, British Columbia office of the Gowlings law firm. The son of Willis Simmons and Ida Williams, he was born in Lewisporte, Newfoundland. After studying at the Salvation Army College for Officers, the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Boston University, Simmons became a teacher in Newfoundland's Salvation Army school system. (At the time, the Salvation Army, along with other denominations, ran its own publicly funded schools.) He subsequently moved to Springdale to become principal of Grant Collegiate and superintendent of the Green Bay Integrated School Board. Simmons married Miriam Jean Torgerson. He became president of the Newfoundland Teachers' Association in 1968 but resigned to run unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Newfoundland Liberal party. In 1973, he was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly as the Liberal Member of the House of Assembly (MHA) for Hermitage. He was re-elected in 1975 as MHA for Burgeo- Bay D'Espoir. In 1979, he resigned his provincial seat and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1979 federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Burin‚ÄîSt. George's. Following the 1980 election, he became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of the Environment, and then parliamentary secretary to the Minister of State for Science and Technology. On August 12, 1983, he was named to the Cabinet of Pierre Trudeau as Minister of State for Mines. He resigned eleven days later after learning that he was being investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for failing to file an income tax return. Simmons thereby set the record for the shortest federal Cabinet career in Canadian history. Simmons lost his seat in the 1984 election. In 1985, he returned to the Newfoundland House of Assembly as the provincial Liberal MHA for Fortune-Hermitage, and briefly served as interim Leader of the Opposition. Simmons returned to the federal House of Commons in the 1988 federal election. He represented Canada at the Rio Summit in 1992. Simmons was re-elected in the 1993 election, and defeated in the 1997 election by Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Matthews.

They are marsupial carnivores, closely related to the Tasmanian devil and the quolls, that live in deserts and spinifex grasslands of arid Australia. They are nocturnal, but occasionally \\"sunbathe\\" in the entrance of the burrow in which they dwell. Their kidneys are highly developed to excrete extremely concentrated urine to preserve water, as the animals rarely drink. They feed mostly on insects, but also eat reptiles and small mammals. They are seasonal breeders breed from June‚ÄìSeptember. The pouch comprises two lateral folds of skin. Recent research has shown two distinct species, which are very similar. The brush-tailed mulgara (D. blythi), (previously classified as D.cristicauda), has an uncrested tail, two upper premolars, and six nipples. The crest-tailed mulgara (previously D. hillieri but now reclassified as D. cristicauda) has a crested tail, three upper premolars, and eight nipples. The generic name Dasycercus means \\"hairy tail\\". Species identification Mulgara in its natural habitat. A long history of confusion exists when classifying mulgaras, and only recently has confidence in the taxonomy of the two species been gained. Identification of the species has been greatly assisted by detailed genetic and morphological studies of museum specimens. The most distinguishing feature in identifying the two species is the crest of hair on the tail. The crest- tailed mulgara has a crest of long black hairs on the upper side of the distal end of the tail, while the brush-tailed mulgara has a brush of black hairs along the final two-thirds of the tail. The two species also have a slightly different dental formation, which is difficult to observe in live animals, and the brush-tailed mulgara has six nipples while the crest-tailed Mulgara has eight. Mulgaras are distributed through the arid regions of Australia where they live in short burrows. The crest-tailed mulgara, previously referred to as the Ampurta, is listed as vulnerable.http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/collections/mammals/mammalogy- mammals-collection/mulgaras Torpor Both species of mulgaras use torpor daily. Studies have shown they use torpor in the wild and in the lab setting. In contrast to most other mammals, mulgaras increase their use of torpor during pregnancy. By conserving energy with torpor, pregnant females can increase their body mass, but it seems they use it to increase fat storage, for lactation later. Pregnant females and breeding males both use torpor during the winter. Free-ranging males, however, only display torpor briefly during the reproductive season, and instead increase their use of torpor after the breeding season is over.

She is India's first and only World Champion in Athletics IAAF World Athletics Final. Anju Bobby George made history when she won the bronze medal in long jump at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris. With this achievement, she became the first Indian athlete ever to win a medal in a World Championships in Athletics jumping 6.70 m. She went on to win the gold medal at the IAAF World Athletics Final (a competition between best eight athletes in the world based on the world ranking) in 2005, a performance she considers her best. Anju was upgraded to the gold status from silver in the 2005 World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo following the disqualification of Tatyana Kotova of Russia by the International Association of Athletics Federations, following the recent re-testing of the latter's sample collected at the 2005 World Championship in Helsinki. She was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2002. She had got 5th position with personal best score of 6.83 at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Early life Anju was born in Kochuparambil family in Cheeranchira village of Changanassery taluk, Kottayam, Kerala, in a Syrian Orthodox family, to K. T. Markose. She was initiated into athletics by her father and her interest was further developed by her trainer in Koruthode school. She did her schooling in CKM Koruthode School and graduated from Vimala College. In the school athletic meet in 1991‚Äì92, she won the 100 m hurdles and relay and stood second in long jump and high jump events, thus becoming the women's champion. Anju's talent was noticed in the national schools games where she won third place in 100 m hurdles and 4 √ó 100 m relay. Professional career Although she started with Heptathlon, she later began to concentrate on her jump events and went on to win long jump medal in the 1996 Delhi junior Asian championship. In 1999 Anju set the national record for triple jump in the Bangalore Federation Cup and silver medal at the South Asian Federation Games in Nepal. In 2001 Anju bettered her own record in long jump to 6.74 m in the National Circuit Meet at Thiruvananthapuram. In the same year she also won gold for triple jump and long jump in the Ludhiana National games. Anju reigned supreme in her events in the Hyderabad National games also. She won the bronze medal clearing 6.49 m at the 2002 Commonwealth Games at Manchester. She also won the gold medal at the Asian Games in Busan. Anju made history when she won the bronze medal clearing 6.70 m in Long Jump at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris, becoming the first Indian athlete ever to win a medal in a World Championships in Athletics. She also won a gold medal at the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. She achieved her personal best of 6.83 m at the 2004 Olympic Games at Athens that brought her the fifth position. This is the current Indian national record. In September 2005, Anju won the gold medal in the women's long jump at the 16th Asian Athletics Championship in Incheon City of South Korea with a leap of 6.65 metres. She went on to win the gold medal at the IAAF World Athletics Final in 2005 with a leap of 6.75 m, a performance she considers her best. She won silver medal in women's long jump in 15th Asian Games, 2006 held at Doha. In 2007, Anju won silver medal in 17th Asian Athletics Championship at Amman (Jordan) with a jump of 6.65m and this qualified her for Osaka World Championship in August 2007 where she finished 9th. Anju start her 2008 season with silver medal in 3rd Asian Indoor Championship in athletics at Doha (Qatar) with a jump of 6.38m and she improved her distance to 6.50m by winning gold in the 3rd South Asian Athletics Championship at Kochi ( Kerala, India). She received the prestigious Arjuna award in 2002‚Äì2003 for eminent sports persons from the government of India and the country's highest sporting honour, Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2003‚Äì2004 after her success in the World Athletic meet. She was conferred Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award in 2004. Anju was ranked 28th on 12 February 2007 rankings of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)(She was once ranked World No. 4). Anju's journey to success from rank 61 in 2001 to rank 6 in 2003 within a short span of two years, was one of sheer hard work and intensive planning. The credit for her success goes to her husband and coach Robert Bobby George, who, according to her, was the biggest influence who helped her in realising her potential and achieving the goal. Bobby, who is a mechanical engineer and a former national champion in triple jump himself, gave up his career to become a full-time coach to Anju in 1998. He belongs to a prestigious sports family and is the younger brother of the famous volleyball player. Anju and Bobby, realising that international exposure is essential for competing in world-class events, made necessary arrangements and trained with Mike Powell, a world record holder, before the World Athletics meet, which gave her valuable exposure in technique. She contested at the 2004 Athens Olympics but remained on 5th position with her personal best score of 6.83. She also contested at the 2008 Beijing Olympics but failed to qualify for the women's long jump event, fouling in all her three attempts. Anju Bobby George pulled out of the 52nd national inter-state athletics in Hyderabad, due to an upper respiratory tract infection. Personal life Anju is married to Robert Bobby George, who is a former national champion in triple jump and her coach too. She is employed with the Customs department in Chennai . The couple have a son Aaron and a daughter Andrea. Involvement with sports association The ace athlete was appointed as president of the Kerala State Sports Council (KSSC).

Valentine took temporary leave from Neighbours in 2010 due to ill health. A few months later, Valentine took indefinite leave from Neighbours to focus on her health and Libby made an off-screen departure on 26 May 2011. Valentine reprised the role for a three-week guest appearance in June 2014. Creation and casting In 1994, Neighbours' storyliners decided to introduce the \\"solid\\" Kennedy family. They felt that they needed to take the show back to its roots when it seemed that all the houses on Ramsay Street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. The show was also suffering from low ratings, and the Kennedys were brought in to \\"bring a fresh burst of energy\\". Alan Fletcher and Jackie Woodburne were cast as Karl Kennedy and Susan Kennedy, with Benjamin McNair and Jesse Spencer cast as brothers Malcolm Kennedy and Billy Kennedy. The role of the Kennedy's daughter went to actress Kym Valentine. She first auditioned for the role of Libby when she was 15 in her home town of Sydney. She recalled: \\"I'd been in Home and Away, and in a sitcom called My Two Wives, but Neighbours was a much bigger thing. For starters, it is filmed in Melbourne, so getting the part meant that I had to move there. I didn't know anyone at all, so it was pretty terrifying.\\" Valentine began working on Neighbours when she was 17. She admitted that leaving her family behind in Sydney was the hardest part about joining the show, but she \\"seized\\" the role of Libby and was determined to be a success. The Kennedys were described as a believable family, and Valentine thought it down to the actors' close bond off-screen. She said they were \\"like a surrogate family to me, and still are.\\" Discussing her longevity in 2000, Valentine explained that she stayed with Neighbours as it provided her with work, and she felt she was still learning and being challenged by the role. Character development=Characterisation Upon her introduction to Neighbours, Libby was described as an opinionated girl who makes a stand on \\"any and every issue.\\" She is as a communist and her political views frustrate her father. She initially wants to go into a government job, but she studies journalism at university instead. The teenage Libby was said to be bright, inquisitive and \\"prim and proper.\\" Her \\"wise beyond her years\\" side has followed her into adulthood and Libby is now a \\"passionate and idealistic\\" woman. She is hard working, honest, headstong and focused on her career and life goals. Libby has a humorous and quirky side, which Valentine loves acting out. The BBC said \\"there's no keeping that irrepressible sense of humour down. She loves a good laugh.\\" On Valentine's return to the Neighbours set in January 2011, she decided to cut her long hair off in favour of a short hairstyle. It was also revealed that Libby would return with a new attitude to life. She has spent time at a health retreat, learnt the \\"art of Zen\\" and now refuses to judge anyone. Valentine said that Libby wants \\"to detach from negativity.\\" She added \\"She looks at her situation ‚Äì single mum, still living with her parents ‚Äì and starts to focus on her career at the school.\\" Departure and return Valentine decided to depart Neighbours in 2004, so she could pursue other acting roles and spend time with her daughter. However, she did make a brief return in 2005 for the show's 20th anniversary episode, \\"Friends for Twenty Years\\". In 2007, Neighbours suffered a decline in ratings and plans were made to take storylines \\"back to basics\\", so they would be less controversial and focus more on relationships and family dynamics. It was then announced that Valentine would be reprising her role of Libby. Of her comeback Valentine said \\"I really felt like I was coming home and it was very easy to slip back into the role of Libby, she's like an old friend. Plus she was older and the writers were able to do a lot more with her so it was a great time to return.\\" Valentine initially intended to return to Neighbours for a brief time. Temporary recast On 4 July 2008, Valentine collapsed on a flight home from New York and was diagnosed with pneumonia and a collapsed lung. Valentine was told that she needed to rest for a month and that she could not return to work on Neighbours. news.com.au initially reported that Libby would be written out of scenes for a week. However, as the character was involved in too many storylines, executive producer Susan Bower, realised that she could not be suddenly written out of the show and she took the decision to temporarily recast the role of Libby. Bower called McLeod's Daughters actress Michala Banas and asked her to take over the role. Banas only had four days to research Libby's history on the show and learn the scripts before she began filming. Banas told the Herald Sun \\"It was crazy, a whirlwind. I spent the first week of filming really stressing about it ‚Äì am I doing this right, is this what Libby would do, am I making the right choices? I felt this real sense of responsibility to Kym and to the character and to the show. I just wanted to do the best job I could for everyone.\\" Banas explained that Libby is a strong woman with a lot of energy and she tried to keep the essence of the character in her portrayal. However, she said that the only way she could \\"tackle\\" the role was to make Libby her own. She added \\"I came to the realisation that I can't be the same Libby as Kym is ‚Äì it's impossible.\\" Banas was reunited with Brett Tucker, her co-star from McLeod's Daughters, for Libby's storylines. Of her character being recast, Valentine said \\"It is like handing over a child to be looked after by somebody else\\". She later returned to the set on 15 September 2008. In May 2009, a short video was created which made light of the recast. The clip, featuring Valentine, Fletcher and Woodburne, saw Susan and Karl questioning Libby over why she changed her head. Marriage to Daniel Fitzgerald and surrogacy Libby's relationship with Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald) comes to an abrupt end after he kisses Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor-Cotter), but Libby soon finds romance again with Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker). Valentine told TV Week that Libby decides that she has had enough of Darren and their relationship is over for good. Then over the next few months there is a hint of romance for Libby and Dan. Tucker said that there is \\"an immediate attraction\\" for Dan when it comes to Libby. Dan hides some secrets from Libby and when she discovers them, there is \\"an emotional upset.\\" Valentine explained \\"Libby will begin to feel like she's being constantly let down by men. She can't seem to take a trick. Guys just keep disappointing her.\\" Tucker added that it was never planned for Libby and Dan to have a trouble free relationship, although he previously thought otherwise. When she was asked to choose between Dan and Drew, Valentine chose Dan and she explained \\"I do honestly think that Dan is more her match. [...] I just think Dan and Libby are very similar like with their careers ‚Äì they've got a lot more in common, they're both teachers and they're both very articulate and educated. I think maybe Libby and Dan can entertain each other a little bit more, in many different ways, than Libby and Drew could.\\" Libby and Dan's relationship does not run smoothly and Dan's ex-wife Samantha (Simone Buchanan) causes problems for them. Sam lies to Dan that she is pregnant with his child and when the lie is exposed, Libby sees Dan is upset that he does not have a child. Valentine told Digital Spy; \\"when Libby sees how upset Dan is about it all, she desperately wants him to have his own child. So for the next few months, we've got this long-term storyline based around Libby wanting to have a baby with Dan which we all know is incredibly risky because she could die if she has another baby.\\" Libby and Dan later marry. During an interview, Susan Bower said that there is nothing interesting in watching an on-screen marriage that is working and she highlighted her plans for the couple; \\"It's a very, very slow, long burn and there's some wonderful humour and the fact there's the Brady Bunch a bit. We are making stories about what happens in people's lives and there's the good and the bad.\\" Libby and Dan decide to have a child via surrogacy. Libby's mother, Susan offers to become the surrogate after Libby is unable have any more children. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan becomes pregnant. However, this causes friction between her and Dan. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Alan Fletcher said he was pleased at the way the surrogacy scenes were handled and he added \\"The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family\\". The show's timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline and the writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. The surrogacy saga puts pressure on Libby and Dan's marriage and it falls apart. Valentine drew on her own experience of going through a divorce to film the scenes. She revealed that she was \\"really really proud\\" of how they portrayed the end of Libby and Dan's marriage and she said that she put her \\"heart and soul\\" into the storyline. She added \\"It was the most intimate storyline I've ever done in my life. I got the chance to really exorcise some demons.\\" Second departure and return In 2010, Valentine took three months off from Neighbours due to ill health. In July of that year, she spent a week in hospital with a lung problem and in December she checked herself into a clinic as she was suffering from exhaustion. Valentine said \\"I'm very grateful to the producers for allowing me time off to get healthy again and this year is already looking fantastic.\\" Valentine returned to the set in January 2011. A few months after her return to filming, Valentine took indefinite leave from Neighbours. Fiona Byrne of the Herald Sun reported the actress was undergoing treatment in hospital for a depressive illness. Susan Bower said Valentine had the support of the production team and her character would be written out of the show in a \\"nice and neat way.\\" Byrne added \\"It has been done so when she is ready to return she (Libby) can walk straight back into the show.\\" Byrne's colleague, Luke Dennehy reported Valentine's contract was up for renewal at the end of 2011. In September 2011, Byrne said Valentine was unlikely to return to Neighbours, though this was not confirmed by the show. On 11 March 2014, it was announced that Valentine would be returning to Neighbours as part of a storyline to celebrate 20 years of Karl and Susan Kennedy. The actress will film a three-week guest appearance. Valentine's return comes a few months after she filed a complaint against FremantleMedia. She told Sarah Thomas from The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"I'm really looking forward to catching up with old friends at Neighbours as well as getting to know many of the new cast. Playing Libby was a very important part of my life and I can't wait to reintroduce audiences to her.\\" Libby returned on 11 June 2014.

Other appearances In 2005, four novellas based on characters from Neighbours were released. The books were available to buy at some Australia Post outlets and on the internet. Libby and Darren Stark were the focus of one of the books entitled Facing Tomorrow. It explains what happened after the couple left Erinsborough in 2004 and followed their new life together. Of the books, a spokeswoman said \\"It's different to what happens in the show; it's more like a fantasy of what happens, might have happened, in the show, they would take about an hour to read if you're a quick reader\\". Reception For her portrayal of Libby, Valentine has earned various awards nominations. In 2008, she was nominated for Sexiest Female at the Inside Soap Awards. The following year she received a nomination for Best Actress and in 2010 was nominated for Best Daytime Star. Libby and Susan's surrogacy storyline was nominated for Best Baby Drama at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. In June 2002, Libby came third in a poll run by Newsround to find viewer's favourite Neighbours character. She received 19.33% of the vote. In January 2009, Ruth Deller, of television website Lowculture included Libby in her monthly list of best and worst soap characters. Libby was placed at number ten on the worst characters list. Deller said \\"Libby's always had the tendency to be a bit smug and self-absorbed, but she's taking it to ridiculous levels at the moment. And her and Fitzy (or her and Lucas) is clearly a wrong thing indeed\\". Virgin Media compiled a list of their sexiest soap couples, Libby and Dan were featured and they stated that they believed the couple were a \\"match made in soap heaven\\" and that \\"nothing can stand in the way of their love apart from Sam\\". Soap opera reporting website Holy Soap opined that Libby's most memorable moment was collapsing at her wedding, finding out she was pregnant and subsequently losing the baby. To celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Libby is in the list and describing her they state: \\"When Libby first joined the programme, she seemed to spend most of her time trying to out-do Ruth Wilkinson in the ugly short-wearing stakes. Then she got all curvy sexy, and as an adult Libby has seen three of the hottest Ds in the Greater Erinsborough area: Darren, Drew and Dan. Her feisty newshound days are long behind her too as she's become a teacher, which apparently in Australia requires no formal training. Interesting.\\" British newspaper, The Guardian, included Libby in a feature called \\"Soaps' most bizarre recasts\\". Of the character's temporary recast, they said \\"A staple of Neighbours since 1994, we've watched Libby Kennedy get married, get widowed, get married again, get divorced and ‚Äì for one confusing month ‚Äì turn into a completely different person. They added that the recast was the \\"most confusing Neighbours moment since that time Bouncer got married in his dreams\\". British weekly magazine NOW compiled a special gallery to decide whether Libby was best played by Valentine or Banas. They describe Libby has never having any luck in her love life and since Drew's death has been doomed it's got worse. In June 2014, Kerry Barrett from All About Soap was pleased to see Libby return, saying \\"We were just as thrilled as the Kennedys were to see lovely Lib back in Erinsborough. And when Karl asked if she had anything to go home to, we thought how brilliant it would be if she stayed.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Libby Kennedy on the Official AU Neighbours website * Libby Kennedy on the Official UK Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Kennedy family (Neighbours) Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Libby Kennedy"},{"id":"1500819","text":"Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero (14 November 1943 ‚Äì 4 April 2020) was the President of Honduras from 27 January 1990 to 27 January 1994, representing the National Party of Honduras (PNH).Muere el expresidente de Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejas Published by La Tribuna, 4 April 2020 and consulted the same day Early life and education Callejas was born on 14 November 1943 in Tegucigalpa in Honduras. He studied agricultural economics at Mississippi State University becoming an expert on financial and economic issues connected to agronomy. At Mississippi State University, Callejas earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1965 and a Masters of Science degree in 1966. Also in 1966, Mississippi State University's Department of Agricultural Economics published Callejas' thesis titled Hog Production Opportunities in Mississippi. In 1990, Callejas was named Mississippi State University's Alumni of the Year and was invited along with U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle to deliver the university's commencement address. Career Between 1967 and 1971 Callejas worked at the Council for Economic Planning (CONSUPLANE). In 1968, Callejas was made the Director of Economic Planning by the then President Oswaldo L√≥pez. in 1975 another General and President, Juan Alberto Melgar, named Callejas Minister for Agriculture and Natural Resources. When another general and President Policarpo Paz took over in a coup in 1978, Callejas remained in this post. During the transition to democracy culminating in November 1981 elections, which were won by the Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH), he rose within the ranks of the National Party of Honduras (PNH), and in 1982 presided over their central committee. He supported former President Ricardo Maduro's Unidad y Cambio (Unity and Change) movement within the PNH that brought the party more towards the center, and a liberal economic path. Callejas then created his own faction, the Movimiento Nacional Callejista (National Callejista Movement), to advance his candidature in the 1985 presidential elections. At the time both main political parties allowed various candidates to stand, and while Callejas gained the highest vote of any candidate with 42.6%, the PLH candidates gained 51.5% of the total vote, and therefore it was their most voted for candidate, Jos√© Azcona del Hoyo, with 27.5% of the vote, who became president. Football Until 2015, Callejas was President of the Federaci√≥n Nacional Aut√≥noma de F√∫tbol de Honduras (FENAFUTH).https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-fifa/story/2992886/former- honduras-president-rafael-callejas-faces-life-ban-from-football Under his tenure, Honduras qualified for the FIFA World Cups in 2010 and 2014, the first time Honduras qualified for two consecutive World Cups. During his tenure, Honduras qualified for all major football soccer competitions in all age brackets, including the Summer Olympics. President (1990-1994) His election in 1989 marked the first time since 1932 that power was transferred peacefully between Honduras' two major parties. Callejas was once again the PNH candidate in the 1989 elections where a reported 200,000 identifications from deceased Honduran citizens were used. Callejas won with 52.3% of the votes, becoming the first PNH President since 1972. He had to confront severe economic problems, and he followed the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by cutting public spending, resulting in many public servants being laid off, and by devaluing the Lempira. At the time of the devaluation of the Lempira, the Honduran Central Bank, presided over at the time by Ricardo Maduro Joest, did not have any dollars available to the general public. Instead, people were given back devalued Lempiras causing a great deal of hardship in what was already one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere. Gasoline supplies were non-existent when he took office and long lines of cars were seen at the gas stations trying to obtain fuel. This led to many strikes and a lot of social agitation, until his government successfully negotiated with the United States the write-off of a $US430 million debt, in September 1991. He presided over a liberal reformist government, opened the Honduran economy to local and foreign investment and managed steady growth during the last three years of his presidency, although during the fourth year of his term fiscal indiscipline led to a new set of economic measures being imposed by the following government. Poverty was reduced by 8% under his tenure. Infrastructure was a priority and large investments in the rich Sula Valley area were made resultung in more than 90 kilometers of four-lane highways. His government had some important accomplishments in the social area, such as the creation of the Family Assistance Program (PRAF) and the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS). Expatriates of the previous Military and Liberal governments were allowed to return to Honduras, with no risk to their lives, and the irregular forces of the Nicaraguan counter- revolutionaries, the Contras, were required to leave Honduras in April 1990 after intense negotiations. Accusations Callejas was accused of 7 counts of corruption during his term. He was also accused by an aide in the George H W Bush administration, resulting in a Bush executive order denying him U.S. visa status. In 2005, the Honduran Congress revoked the law by which ex- Presidents, among other former officials, had legal immunity. Mr. Callejas voluntarily presented himself to court (first person to do so after the law was revoked). Mr. Callejas then faced trial. He was acquitted by the Honduran Judiciary of all of the counts which were presented against him. On 3 December 2015, Mr. Callejas was indicted in U.S. Federal Court in connection with the ongoing 2015 FIFA Corruption Case. 12 days later, he flew to the United States and was taken into custody. A few days later, he was released on bond.Associated Press: \\"Honduran Ex-President Ordered Freed on $4M Bond in FIFA Case.

Dowiyogo then supported the DPN in the Parliament. Goals and influence The most important goal of the DPN was to prevent an expansion of power by DeRoburt and to force the role of the Parliament. In 1989 DeRoburt had been ousted in a vote of no confidence by Kenos Aroi who had been supported by Adeang and his entourage but only for four months. Bernard Dowiyogo is the last DPN member to have been President of Nauru (2003). Afterwards, the DPN increasingly lost influence; considering it hasn't attained a seat in the Parliament since Dowiyogo's death in 2003. In 2003 the son of Kennan Adeang, David Adeang, founded the Nauru First party.

It was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War in 1953. The name originates from the final ultimatum that was given to prisoners of war brought to the bridge for repatriation: they could either remain in the country of their captivity or cross the bridge to return to their homeland. However, once they chose to cross the bridge, they would never be allowed to return, even if they later changed their minds. The last time the bridge was used for prisoner exchanges was in 1968, when the crew of was released and ordered to cross into South Korea via the bridge. The bridge was actively used by the North Koreans up until the Korean axe murder incident in August 1976, at which time the United Nations Command (UNC) demanded that the Military Demarcation Line within the Joint Security Area be enforced and clearly marked. Within 72 hours, the North Koreans had built a new bridge (dubbed \\"The 72-Hour Bridge\\") on the northern half of the JSA and the original Bridge of No Return was no longer used. The Military Demarcation Line runs through the middle of the bridge. At the end of either side of the bridge are guard houses of the respective countries. The North Korean building is called KPA#4 while the United Nations Command checkpoint was called CP#3 (it was abandoned in the mid-1980s). CP#3, which is surrounded by trees, was only visible from one other UNC site during the winter months, OP#5 (now renamed to CP#3). The North's Korean People's Army (KPA) had made numerous attempts to grab UNC personnel from the old CP#3 and drag them across the bridge into North Korean territory. Because of this proximity to North Korean territory, being surrounded on all access routes by North Korean checkpoints, and repeated attempts to kidnap the UNC personnel working there, CP#3 was often referred to as \\"The Loneliest Outpost in the World\\". As of 2003, the bridge is considered in need of repair. According to a report on CNN, the US government has offered to fix the bridge or even replace it, but North Korea has denied permission. Major events *Operation Little Switch, April 1953. This operation was a test case for prisoner repatriation, one of the four main issues of contention during two years of negotiation. 605 sick, wounded, and/or injured UNC prisoners were exchanged for 6,030 sick or injured North Korean prisoners.Bernstein, Barton. \\"The Struggle over the Korean Armistice: Prisoners of Repatriation?\\" in Child of Conflict: The Korean-American Relationship 1943‚Äì1953, ed.

Based on the success of the repatriations undertaken earlier, a general exchange of prisoners began in late April. During Operation Big Switch, prisoners were brought to Panmunjom, on the banks of the Sachong River. Each prisoner was then asked if he wished to cross the river and return to his countrymen or remain with his captors. Once the choice was made there was no turning back‚Äîhence the name Bridge of No Return. During this time 13,444 UNC prisoners returned to UNC countries, and 89,493 KPA and CPV prisoners returned to their countries. In March 1953, a further 25,000 KPA soldiers held in ROKA camps had been released into South Korea on President Syngman Rhee's orders in an attempt to wreck the armistice negotiations.\\"Syngman Rhee Biography: Rhee Attacks Peace Proceedings\\" *Release of the crew of the USS Pueblo, December 23, 1968. On January 23, 1968, the USS Pueblo was captured by North Korean naval forces in international waters off the coast of North Korea. After being held prisoner for 11 months, the crew was released and allowed to walk across the Bridge while a forced confession by the Captain of the vessel was broadcast over loudspeakers.FC Schumacher and GC Wilson (1971). Bridge of No Return: The Ordeal of the USS Pueblo, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York. This action was the first in a series of events that escalated tensions between North Korea and the United States and its allies. *Korean axe murder incident, August 18, 1976. This was the killing of two United States Army officers by North Korean soldiers in the Joint Security Area, near the Bridge of No Return, over the attempt to trim a poplar that obstructed vision between checkpoints, and heightened tensions on the border. This was followed by Operation Paul Bunyan, which ended in the felling of the tree by Task Force Vierra. Ceremonies on the bridge U.S. Army Soldier posing during a 2003 ceremony at the middle of the bridge, in front of the flags of the UN, the US, and South Korea, while two guards are facing toward North Korea. U.S. Army soldiers who are stationed at Camp Bonifas or Camp Liberty Bell in the Joint Security Area are offered the opportunity to have their promotion or reenlistment ceremonies held in the center of the Bridge of No Return. The bridge is split in half by the Military Demarcation Line which separates North Korean territory from South Korean territory. During a U.S. or ROK (Republic of Korea) ceremony, two guards are posted at the Demarcation Line facing west (toward North Korea).

It is one of three surviving bandicoot species in the genus Perameles. It is distinguishable from its partially-sympatric congener ‚Äì the long-nosed bandicoot ‚Äì via three or four dark horizontal bars found on its rump. It is the only species of bandicoot found on Tasmania, where it is relatively abundant. The mainland population in Victoria is struggling and is subject to ongoing conservation endeavors. This species is the basis for the popular video game character Crash Bandicoot. Description The eastern barred bandicoot weighs less than and has a short tail and three to four whitish bars across the rump. The Eastern barred bandicoot has two separated populations, one on the mainland of Australia and one on the island of Tasmania. The Tasmanian form is somewhat larger than the mainland form as the average adult mass is 750 g in Victoria and 1,000 g in Tasmania. It lives for just two to three years and is not gregarious. Males occupy large home ranges compared to females and only consort with females for mating. This species is nocturnal. It emerges from its nest at dusk to forage for a variety of invertebrates including crickets, beetles and earthworms. During the day it rests in a grass-lined nest. When foraging, it uses its long nose to probe deep into the soil and then digs eagerly when it locates food. Females have 8 nipples and can produce a maximum of 5 young in one litter with an average of 2 to 3 young. Gestation lasts just 12 days‚Äîthis is one of the shortest gestation periods of any mammal. Young are weaned at 55 days and emerged juveniles remain dependent upon the mother and forage with her until day 86. Given ideal conditions, females can have up to five litters per year although reproduction becomes depressed in summer and ceases altogether in times of drought. Distribution and conservation status The eastern barred bandicoot was once distributed across the Basalt Plains of south west Victoria, and in Tasmania. Due to predation by introduced foxes and cats, along with land-clearing for farming practices, the Victorian subspecies is critically endangered. Since 1989, eight reintroduction sites have been established across the bandicoot's former range. The conservation of Eastern barred bandicoots in Victoria now depends upon the success of captive breeding and reintroduction programs. Keys to this conservation plan include maintaining an insurance population in captivity, conducting research to improve breeding and reintroduction success and increasing community awareness and support for this rare marsupial.Hill, R., Winnard, A. and Watson, M. (2010). National Recovery Plan for the Eastern Barred Bandicoot (mainland) Perameles gunnii unnamed subspecies. Department of Sustainability and Environment, Melbourne. A management plan, developed in 1987 and revised in 1989, recommended the first reintroduction of the eastern barred bandicoot in Victoria at Woodlands Historic Park, 20 km northwest of Melbourne. Animals were translocated from the last remaining free-ranging mainland population in Hamilton, Western Victoria to captive breeding facilities at Woodlands to establish a population in 1988. The captive-bred offspring formed the basis for reintroductions into the Nature Reserve, known as the Back Paddock, a 400-ha section of the park with a predator-resistant fence to keep out feral predators. Unfortunately, populations at four sites are now extinct (Floating Islands Nature Reserve, Lanark, Cobra Killuc Wildlife Reserve and Lake Goldsmith Nature Reserve), functionally extinct at Woodlands Historic park, declining at Mooramong and increasing at Hamilton Community Parklands and Mount Rothwell. The last remaining wild population, which was once found along the Grange Burn (a creek) in Hamilton, has also been declared extinct. The estimated population size for the Victorian Eastern Barred bandicoot is 150 individuals. The Tasmanian subspecies (P. g. gunni) is vulnerable to extinction. Listed as Vulnerable (VU A1b v2.3) This species is more widespread than its mainland cousin because Tasmania provides large areas of suitable habitat and because the island lacks the bandicoot's main predator, the red fox. Recovery efforts In the state of Victoria, a Recovery Team oversees actions aimed at conserving the Victorian subspecies. Representatives of government agencies, NGOs and private conservation groups collaborate to develop and implement actions to improve the species' outlook. Groups include Conservation Volunteers, Zoos Victoria, Parks Victoria www.parkweb.vic.gov.au, Mount Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre, University of Melbourne, Conservation Enterprises Unlimited, National Trust of Australia (Victoria) and Department of Sustainability and Environment. Volunteers are encouraged to participate in recovery efforts arranged by Conservation Volunteers as part of the Wild Futures program. An effective recovery tactic currently in use is the exclusion of invasive predators from populations of threatened eastern barred bandicoots through the extensive use of conservation fences. Non-native predator species that are fenced out from endangered populations include feral cats and red foxes. Another important feature of conservation fences are that they restrict the spread of infectious diseases among the few remaining animals. Phylogeny and evolutionary relationships The eastern barred bandicoot is most closely related to the other species of bandicoot in its genus, of which only two species are still extant today. These surviving relatives are the western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville) and the long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta). It is also closely related to the desert bandicoot of the same genus, but this species has become extinct. There are about 20 other bandicoots in the same family, Peramelidae. They share similar features of long pointed snouts, and small ears. The bandicoots are closely related to the bilbies, which share the same order, Peramelemorphia. These are all from the infraclass Marsupialia, shared of course with other species such as koalas and kangaroos, which means they diverged from the other placental mammals about 100 million years ago. All the species of this order are native to Australia and New Guinea; however it is unclear how closely related this order is to the rest of the marsupials. The bandicoots have two features that suggest separate and quite opposite ideas of their evolution. They have three pairs of lower front incisors, which would usually suggest evolution from the order Dasyuromorphia, which consists of carnivorous marsupials; however, the bandicoot's middle two digits are syndactylous, meaning they are joined together except for the claw. This would suggest they share the common ancestor of the Diprotodontia which includes the kangaroos and koalas. There are, of course, theories using these features to describe their evolution. The incisors could, in fact, be analogous features shared between the bandicoot and the order Dasyuromorphia. They share the same function, after all, and though they are structurally similar the incisors of the carnivorous marsupials are a lot sharper than the flatter versions in the Bandicoot. The Bandicoot may have evolved the third tooth separately. If this was the case, it would seem logical that the syndactyl feet were homologous features shared between the Bandicoots and the kangaroos, wombats, possums and other species. This would make sense as syndactyly is so rare it is unlikely that it would evolve twice in two separate populations. The feet of the bandicoot when compared to, say, the kangaroo are structurally quite similar. This similarity suggests that the bandicoots share a more recent ancestor with them. Nevertheless, though this idea is more likely, simply because of the rarity of syndactyly, it is possible that syndactyly evolved in the two different populations, and that bandicoots are actually more closely related to species such as the Tasmanian devil and the numbat. This would mean the incisors were homologous features, structurally the same but with a slightly different function (as the carnivorous marsupials use them to rip through flesh), and the syndactyl hind feet are analogous features, as they are used for the same basic function but are not evidence of divergent evolution. Current molecular evidence does not support or disprove any of these theories, or any other related theories that are not suggested here. It is not quite definitive where the bandicoot sits exactly in the tree of life, but whatever the case, it seems that the relationship between the bandicoots and bilbies with the other orders is a distant one.

The River Nene runs north of the village separating it from Oundle. Demographics The 2001 census showed there were 362 people living in the village, 171 male, 191 female, with average age 40.54 years in 150 households. The population shown at the 2011 census was 369. Governance The village has its own Parish Council and is part of East Northamptonshire District Council, where it is in Barnwell Ward, and Northamptonshire County Council where it is in Thrapston division. Barnwell is part of the parliamentary Constituency of Corby. Facilities and other buildings The village has two Church of England churches reflecting the fact that the village is formed from two separate ones. St Andrew's is externally mostly 13th century including a tower. There are monuments to Christopher Freeman (d.1610) and Rev Nicholas Latham (d.1620). All Saints' is also 13th century but only the chancel remains after the rest was demolished in 1825 and that retains the Montagu monuments: Henry Montagu (d.1625), Dame Letice Montagu (d.1611). South-east of the church are Latham's Almshouses (founded 1601, rebuilt 1874). Barnwell railway station on the Northampton to Peterborough line closed in 1964. The building remains preserved as a private residence on the corner of Well Lane and the A605. There is a traditional English pub The Montagu arms in a thatched building. Barnwell St Andrew Church of England Primary School was closed by the county council in 2005 in spite of protests.Anger at loss of heart of village - Peterborough Telegraph, 25 March 2004, accessed 23 March 2010 Children are now bussed to the primary school at Oundle. Local attractions=Barnwell Country Park Like many similar areas on the River Nene, the Barnwell Country Park was developed from abandoned sand and gravel workings on the flood plain of the river just south of Oundle in the part of the area known as Rockingham Forest. The park is bounded on the north-west and south-west by a flood channel loop of the River Nene, known as 'the Backwater', and on the east by the A605 Barnwell Road. It consists of a series of willow-fringed lakes, short mown grass, coarser vegetation, conservation grassland and small wooded areas. The lakes, picnic meadows, river and the resident water birds make the park very attractive to visitors and in particular young families. The irregular shapes of the lakes provide different views around each corner and give a sense of \\"progressive revelation\\" to visitors. The park is flat and very accessible with a network of stone paths suitable for prams and wheelchairs. There is a Ranger Service, on hand to answer visitors' queries and to provide general assistance. In 2007 to 2008, 191,874 visits were made to the park (electronic car counter, assuming 3.5 people per car). From the 2007 visitor surveys, picnicking, dog walking, leisurely strolls, feeding the water birds, fishing and watching the wildlife are the main reason for visits. There is a hard standing car park for 50 cars and the recreational meadows are used for overflow parking. The park, totalling , is owned by Northamptonshire County Council. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TL 036874. Barnwell Castle Barnwell Castle is in the northern part of the village and believed to have been built around 1266. It is described as 'the first example in Britain of the most monumental type of castle architecture. The site is private property but can be seen from the road. Barnwell Manor Barnwell Manor is the historic former home of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and is part of the Barnwell Castle Estate. The manor was granted to the Montagu family in 1540 by King Henry VIII. In 1938 Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, bought the house and estate and the family still retain it but now live in an apartment in Kensington Palace, London.

Peary was a Liberty ship which gained fame during World War II for being built in a shorter time than any other such vessel. Named after Robert Peary, an American explorer who claimed to have been the first person to reach the geographic North Pole, she was launched on November 12, 1942 just 4 days, 15 hours and 29 minutes after the keel was laid down.Sawyer, L. A. and Mitchell, W. H. The Liberty Ships: The History of the \\"Emergency\\" Type Cargo Ships Constructed in the United States During the Second World War, Second Edition, pp. 8, 9, 140, 145, Lloyd's of London Press Ltd., London, England, 1985. . Construction The SS Robert E. Peary was built at the Permanente Metals Corporation No. 2 Yard in Richmond, California and was the 47th ship built at the yard. The record set in her construction was the result of a competition between shipyards to see which could build a Liberty ship the fastest. The Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation had built another Liberty ship, the SS Joseph N. Teal, in only ten days between September 13 and September 23, 1942. The yard's owner, Henry J. Kaiser (who also owned the Richmond Shipyards), was asked by a reporter if it could have been done quicker. He replied that it could have been constructed in eight days but had been delayed to allow President Franklin D. Roosevelt to attend. Roosevelt agreed to a proposal to build a ship in half the time. To meet the deadline, the Richmond Shipyard prefabricated as much of the vessel as possible at its No. 2 Yard and pre-positioned the sections to enable the workers to assemble it with maximum efficiency. The keel was laid at 12:01 am on November 8, 1942. The rest of the ship was built from prefabricated 250-ton sections with the engines already in place. The bottom shell unit was installed first, followed by the inner-bottom unit to support the boiler, engine and pump. The boilers were put in place by mid-morning, followed by transverse bulkheads and the shaft tunnel. The upper deck was completed on the second day, with the installation of the lower forepeak, more bulkheads and the fantail. The masts, derricks and superstructure were installed on the third day. During the final day the wiring, welding and painting was completed along with the installation of the forward gun platform and the inner stack. She was launched at 3:27 pm on November 12 after around 250,000 individual parts weighing had been assembled. After 26 minutes of speeches, Mrs. James F. Byrnes, the wife of the head of Roosevelt's Economic Stabilization Office, christened the ship and it was sent down the slipway into San Francisco Bay. It was delivered for service on November 15, setting an additional record of 7 days, 14 hours and 32 minutes from laying the keel to delivery. The record speed of the construction was a propaganda effort intended to show that the United States could produce ships faster than they could be sunk. Normally, the Permanente yard took an average of about 50 days to build a Liberty ship. In fact, though, it could not realistically be done much faster as there was not enough steel or capacity to build them at such a pace. The ship was referred to as a \\"stunt ship\\", though Henry Kaiser referred to it as an \\"incentive ship\\" because of the boost that it provided to his workers' morale. Nonetheless, the extreme rapidity of the Robert E. Peary construction illustrated how successfully US shipyards had adopted methods of mass production that had been pioneered in the motor industry; at the start of the Liberty ship program, the ships took an average of 1.4 million man-hours and 355 days to build, but by 1943 the figures had come down to under 500,000 man-hours (or 57 man years) and an average of 41 days. Service career The SS Robert E. Peary sailed on her maiden voyage on November 22. She was operated by the Weyerhauser Steamship Company and first served in the Pacific Theatre, sailing to Noumea, New Caledonia before heading onwards to Guadalcanal. She sailed to the Atlantic Ocean in April 1943 and operated there for the remainder of the war on the convoy routes to Europe, ferrying prisoners of war from North Africa and serving off Omaha Beach on D-Day. She was withdrawn to the Wilmington Reserve Fleet in December 1946 and was scrapped in June 1963 at Baltimore, Maryland.Veronico (2007), p. 37Sawyer, L. A. and Mitchell, W. H.

They're playing you.\\" The series first aired on January 13, 2005, and is the second original drama series from ESPN, following Playmakers. It was created by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, who co-wrote the poker-themed feature film Rounders. The series title refers to being \\"on tilt\\", which is poker jargon for letting frustration or other emotional stress interfere with one's poker-playing judgment. While that term is applicable to any form of poker, only one form of the game--no-limit Texas hold'em--is featured in the series. This was presumably meant to capitalize on the growing popularity of no-limit hold'em in the mid-2000s (decade), which was due in part to ESPN's own coverage of the annual World Series of Poker (WSOP), the event upon which the \\"World Championship of Poker\\" (WCOP) depicted in Tilt is presumably based. Tilt is a nine-episode mini-series and was not renewed beyond that. A DVD set of the entire nine-episode run of the series was released on June 14, 2005, about three months after \\"The Last Hand\\" ran on ESPN. Plot Most of the series takes place within the confines of the fictitious Colorado Casino in Las Vegas. There, a group of professional poker players has banded together to take down legendary gambler Don \\"The Matador\\" Everest (Michael Madsen) in a cash game. Each player has his own reason for wanting to hurt Everest, including a cop, Lee Nickel (Chris Bauer), who wants to see him in prison for killing Nickel's brother. Everest, as it turns out, is a sophisticated poker cheat. His preferred cheating method is collusion with hired partners (Everest calls them his \\"horses\\") at the same table, who signal their hole cards to Everest by flashing subtle hand signs. Toward the end of the series, during the \\"World Championship of Poker\\" tournament, Everest's horses also help him advance in the tournament by accumulating chips during their own play, then \\"dumping\\" them to Everest by intentionally losing to him and passing them during breaks. Everest runs his cheating racket in much the same manner as a Mafia boss, treating his loyal partners lavishly but also coming down brutally on those who violate his trust (up to and including murder, thus giving his \\"Matador\\" nickname a whole new literal meaning), and bribing Colorado Casino officials and even local law enforcement to turn a blind eye toward his illegal activities. One member of the group arrayed against Everest, Eddie Towne (Eddie Cibrian), manages to gain the Matador's trust and is offered a role as one of his horses. This enables Towne to learn firsthand how Everest operates, and eventually to set up a high-stakes game involving himself, his partners and Everest, in which he and his partners plan to use the Matador's own signaling system against him. Unfortunately for them, they learn the hard way that Everest was onto them from the beginning. Towne is brutally cast out of Everest's stable, and his partners are forced to abandon their stake money to Everest (as the price for not having charges pressed against them for their own attempt at cheating). No longer able to break Everest at the poker table, Towne's group decides to take a different approach: Join forces with Nickel to try and turn Everest's associates against him. Nickel has also gained another ally: erstwhile Colorado Casino President Bart \\"Lowball\\" Rogers, recently ousted for crossing Everest one too many times. Lowball stakes Towne and his partners the $10,000 buy-in for the WCOP tournament, so that they can keep Everest preoccupied while he and Nickel put the heat on his henchmen. Meanwhile, one of Towne's partners, Clark Marcellin (Todd Williams), brings Everest's cheating racket and attendant murders to the attention of an undercover FBI agent. In between WCOP playing sessions, Towne and his partners help the agent build a federal case against Everest. Ultimately Everest and Towne become the last two players left in the WCOP tournament. Towne wins the heads-up battle, only to learn later that Everest had deliberately thrown the hand‚Äîand had his daughter bet enough money on Towne to more than cover the prize difference between first and second place. Everest is then arrested by the FBI, but in the closing moments of the final episode a key witness against Everest is found hanged in a shower tub, as an apparent suicide.

Most arbitrageurs who employ this strategy trade globally. In pursuit of their goal of both steady returns and low volatility, the arbitrageurs can focus upon interest rate swaps, US non-US government bond arbitrage, US Treasury securities, forward yield curves, and/or mortgage-backed securities. The practice of fixed-income arbitrage in general has been compared to \\"picking up nickels in front of a steamroller\\". However, despite this notion, some research has shown that consistent excess returns may be earned with this approach, and as more hedge fund capital is allocated towards these strategies, excess returns will begin to diminish.Risk and Return in Fixed Income Arbitrage: Nickels in Front of a Steamroller?

Located in the Lower Laurentians on Lake of Two Mountains, where the Ottawa has its confluence with the St. Lawrence River, the town has a main thoroughfare that is now part of Quebec Route 344. It's located 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Montreal. This area was colonized by French settlers as a mission to First Nations in 1721 by brothers of the Sulpician Order branch of the Roman Catholic Church. Traditional owners are Mohawk (Kanienkaha), Algonquin, and Nipissing, who had a village known as Kanesatake, now a reserve within the boundaries of Oka. History=17th and 18th centuries Oka is historically connected to the first Amerindian mission established by the Sulpicians in Montreal. It was in 1718, moreover, that the Sulpicians obtained from the King of France the concession of the seigneury of Deux-Montagnes which corresponded to the present territories of the parishes of Oka, Saint- Placide, Saint-Beno√Æt, Saint-Joseph The lake and the surrounding area. =Original influx of inhabitants = The mission of La Montagne was transferred in 1696 to Sault-au-R√©collet in Montreal and from there to Lac des Deux-Montagnes in 1721. This last movement was facilitated by the fact that in 1717 the Seigneurie du Lac Of the Deux-Montagnes was conceded to the Sulpicians by the King of France on the express condition of transferring the Indian mission there. Final concession was given in 1718 after the transfer of the mission proper. In 1720 Catholic Iroquois who were previously at the Sault au R√©collet mission were moved to the new location. In 1721, under the direction of Quere de Tr√©guron, Sulpician, a group of Algonquins and Iroquois emigrated on the shores of Lake Deux-Montagnes. By 1722 the transfer was almost completed. The proposed site was advantageous for the conversion of the Indians and for their defense and that of the colony. To prepare their installation, another Sulpician, Mr. Gay (who was the superior), made some clearing and build various buildings including a chapel, the missionary's house, a school intended for the Sisters of the Congregation Notre-Dame as well as cabins for the Indians. The Indian population increased considerably around 1727 when the Nipissingues and the Algonquins of the √éle-aux-Tourtes mission also came to the Lake with their missionary Pierre-√âlie D√©peret. = Building of Oratories = It is impossible to speak of the Lordship of the Lake without recalling that between 1740 and 1742, there was the setting up of the seven oratories that constitute the famous Calvary of Oka, work of the Sulpicians. Francois dit Belleville (who arrived in Nouvelle-France in 1754) was the author of the bas-reliefs of the chapels of this pilgrimage site, which is the oldest in America. The missionary Louis-Urgel Lafontaine (1895-1930) was the last to preach in Iroquois [language] at the location. The Calvary was built by the Indians and only for them in order to evangelize them. 19th and 20th centuries In the 19th century, as a result of the conquest of 1760, there was unrest among the various communities. The Mohawks allied with the British and turned against the French while the Algonquins had taken the side of the French. The church, the presbytery and the outbuildings of Oka were set on fire on 15 June 1877. The present church was built between 1878 and 1883 according to the plans of the architects Perrault and Mesnard. =Oka crisis= In 1990, the small community gained international attention in what became known as the Oka Crisis. It had approved development of a private golf course, to add nine holes and nearby luxury housing. The Mohawk of Kanesatake opposed this. Several years before the crisis the Mohawks had initiated and lost a land claim court case in which they tried to gain control of what they termed \\"historic land\\". Land known from the early mission settlement as the \\"pine forest\\". The claim was rejected by the Provincial courts. Much of the anger over this court loss and other non Oka related issues, as witnessed by the congregation of other tribes which had unresolved land claim issues resulting from the British conquests was unleashed during the crisis. The Mohawk of Kanesatake barricaded a dirt road leading to the land. During a 78-day confrontation, the Quebec Police Force (SQ) (and later Canadian Army units) confronted members of the Mohawk nation of the adjacent community of Kanesatake. The latter were joined by other Mohawk and First Nations and Native American tribes. In addition, for several weeks, Mohawk at Kahnawake blockaded the approach to the Mercier Bridge, a route that ran through their land. Negotiations finally led to the Mohawk re-opening the road. An SQ officer Corporal Lemay was shot and killed at a period of heightened tensions. Numerous people were arrested. The disputed area was acquired by the Canadian Federal Government to appease the developers. Development was stopped. Some in the media reported the Mohawk's opposition to be based on the expansion of the golf course over what the Mohawks considered sacred land. This however was never the premise of contention. Instead the dispute laid over persistent claims dating back to land right issues between the Sulpicians and Mohawks that related not to burial grounds or cemeteries, but to what was known as the \\"pine forest\\" and that commenced at the onset of the British conquests, the Mohawks allegiance to them and the definite change of attitude of the Mohawks towards the French. The Oka crisis garnered a great deal of media attention, and brought forth dozens of articles and books. The death of Corporal Lemay remains unsolved however, and the ongoing land claims to the pine forest have all, as of January 16, 2017, been dismissed in Federal courts. Despite promises to the contrary much of the disputed land obtained by the Federal Government remains unceded to traditional owners.

Founded by Joe Born in 2001 as a division of Digital Innovations, it previously operated under the name Neuros Audio. Like Digital Innovations, Neuros distinguished itself by its use of open-innovation and crowdsourcing techniques to bring products to market, as well as by its prominent use of open-source software and open- source hardware.Neuros and open-source article on Neuros' Wiki http://wiki.neurostechnology.com/index.php/The_Neuros_and_Open_Source In its development model, end users were involved throughout the product development process from reviewing initial concepts to beta testing initial product releases.  Products = Neuros LINK  The Neuros LINK is an open set- top device designed to bring Internet television and other video to the television, it comes pre-installed with XBMC Media Center. The Neuros LINK supports the web's open standards allows Internet television sites to be viewed directly on a television set. The Neuros LINK is positioned between three categories, a HTPC (Home Theater PC), digital media receiver (a.k.a. media extender), and the standard Internet-to-television devices or set-top- boxes. It is open and allows access to all content sources using software and hardware components from a PC, but positioned as a lower cost, smaller consumer electronics device designed to be connected to a television set.Neuros LINK technical specs http://www.neurostechnology.com/neuros-link- technical-specs  Neuros OSD  The Neuros OSD is a device to archive, organize, and play video content. It can record from any source with composite output including DVD players, VCRs and others. The video input is converted to MP4 format and then output to a user-installed device, either a memory card, a USB flash drive or USB hard drive, or to a network-connected PC.http://www.arsgeek.com/2007/11/01/arsgeek-reviews-the-neuros-osd/ The resulting MP4 files can then be played back by the OSD on a TV, or by other devices with MP4 playback capability such as Sony's PlayStation Portable, Apple's iPod, Neuros 442 and other portable devices. OSD stands for \\"open- source device\\", because the device runs Linux and a variety of open-source software, as well as to reflect the vision that the device will become a general purpose device for linking computer and electronic devices. The successor to the Neuros MPEG 4 Recorder, the Neuros OSD was released to initial production on September 20, 2006. The development platform uses a Texas Instruments DM320 system on chip, comprising an ARM926EJ core and a TI C54x DSP core. This design will support the DM320's High Performance mode of operation. The maximum ARM clock is then specified as 203 MHz. The DSP is rated in excess of 120 MHz. In addition, the SoC also contains dedicated hardware acceleration for video encoding and decoding, making it capable of achieving DVD-like quality playback as well as high quality, D1 resolution video encoding using MPEG-4.  Neuros digital audio computer  The Neuros Digital Audio Computer (Neuros DAC) is a portable audio unit designed for playback and recording of audio in MP3, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and DRM-free WMA formats. Neuros DACs feature a two-piece design, separating the unit into a player and a \\"backpack\\". The player unit is upgradeable by firmware upgrade from the website. The intended purpose of these design decisions are that you can upgrade your player/backpack without paying for an entirely new model. There are currently two types of backpacks. The smaller backpack contains just a pair of NiMH batteries, so the player depends on the internal flash memory to store music. The larger backpack contains a LiIon battery and a 2.5-inch hard drive. The main difference between Neuros1 and Neuros2 players is the backpack on Neuros2 has a USB 2.0 connector allowing it to be used, independently of the player unit, as a stand-alone USB hard drive. The Neuros DAC is not currently in production, but a third version of the product has been rumored.  Neuros MPEG 4 recorder  The Neuros MPEG 4 Recorder is a flash-based digital recorder that works like a miniature VCR (sans TV tuner card), allowing users to record live TV from an analog video sources (for example a DVD player or camcorder), have it encoded in real-time and stored onto a flash memory card. It is capable of recording and playing back MPEG-4 and has several unique consumer benefits like ignoring Macrovision's automatic gain control copy protection. The Recorder was first released to the public on February 9, 2005 in woot.com's first product launch. That launch was part of Neuros Technology's gamma test program and consisted of 850 units sold at $119.99 (US) each. The Neuros MPEG4 Recorder was revised as version 2 with an enhanced processor and higher resolution recording (480p) for use with devices such as the iPod, PlayStation Portable, smartphones and other handhelds.  Open development methods = Open innovation  Neuros uses many of the tools of the open-source world to not only collaborate on building the software but to get user feedback on features and implementation as well. Products are typically launched explicitly before the software is complete under Beta and Gamma programs. As community members develop new features, often in response to posted bounties, Neuros promotes that work to other users and gauges reaction.Neuros Bounties Blog Posting http://open.neurostechnology.com/node/562 This crowdsourced process has been viewed by some as a hybrid between traditional market research and open-source collaboration.  Open-source software and hardware  A distinguishing feature of the Neuros devices is that they use open-source software and use open-source methods in the development of their devices; open-source software is regularly used as well as the release of documentation surrounding the hardware. This also allows the devices to be adapted for other purposes than the advertised uses, such as including home and auto-security recording. In addition the company advocates consumers digital rights by making products that assert those rights, allowing unfettered recording from a variety of sources. In December 2007, Neuros developed an \\"Unlocked Media\\" name and logo for DRM-free media to allow companies to brand their products in such a way that consumers know they're getting a fully portable file.

Since the regression line does not miss any of the points by very much, the R2 of the regression is relatively high. Comparison of the Theil‚ÄìSen estimator (black) and simple linear regression (blue) for a set of points with outliers. Because of the many outliers, neither of the regression lines fits the data well, as measured by the fact that neither gives a very high R2. In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted R2 or r2 and pronounced \\"R squared\\", is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is a statistic used in the context of statistical models whose main purpose is either the prediction of future outcomes or the testing of hypotheses, on the basis of other related information. It provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model. There are several definitions of R2 that are only sometimes equivalent. One class of such cases includes that of simple linear regression where r2 is used instead of R2. When an intercept is included, then r2 is simply the square of the sample correlation coefficient (i.e., r) between the observed outcomes and the observed predictor values. If additional regressors are included, R2 is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. In both such cases, the coefficient of determination normally ranges from 0 to 1. There are cases where the computational definition of R2 can yield negative values, depending on the definition used. This can arise when the predictions that are being compared to the corresponding outcomes have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure using those data. Even if a model-fitting procedure has been used, R2 may still be negative, for example when linear regression is conducted without including an intercept, or when a non-linear function is used to fit the data. In cases where negative values arise, the mean of the data provides a better fit to the outcomes than do the fitted function values, according to this particular criterion. Since the most general definition of the coefficient of determination is also known as the Nash‚ÄìSutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, this last notation is preferred in many fields, because denoting a goodness-of-fit indicator that can vary from ‚àí‚àû to 1 (i.e., it can yield negative values) with a squared letter is confusing. When evaluating the goodness-of-fit of simulated (Ypred) vs. measured (Yobs) values, it is not appropriate to base this on the R2 of the linear regression (i.e., Yobs= m¬∑Ypred \\\\+ b). The R2 quantifies the degree of any linear correlation between Yobs and Ypred, while for the goodness-of-fit evaluation only one specific linear correlation should be taken into consideration: Yobs = 1¬∑Ypred \\\\+ 0 (i.e., the 1:1 line). Definitions thumb400pxR^2 = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\color{blue}{SS_\\\\text{res}}}{\\\\color{red}{SS_\\\\text{tot}}} The better the linear regression (on the right) fits the data in comparison to the simple average (on the left graph), the closer the value of R^2 is to 1. The areas of the blue squares represent the squared residuals with respect to the linear regression. The areas of the red squares represent the squared residuals with respect to the average value. A data set has n values marked y1,...,yn (collectively known as yi or as a vector y = [y1,...,yn]T), each associated with a fitted (or modeled, or predicted) value f1,...,fn (known as fi, or sometimes ≈∑i, as a vector f). Define the residuals as ei = yi ‚àí fi (forming a vector e). If \\\\bar{y} is the mean of the observed data: :\\\\bar{y}=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i then the variability of the data set can be measured with two sums of squares formulas: * The total sum of squares (proportional to the variance of the data): :: SS_\\\\text{tot}=\\\\sum_i (y_i-\\\\bar{y})^2 * The sum of squares of residuals, also called the residual sum of squares: :: SS_\\\\text{res}=\\\\sum_i (y_i - f_i)^2=\\\\sum_i e_i^2\\\\, The most general definition of the coefficient of determination is :R^2 = 1 - {SS_{\\\\rm res}\\\\over SS_{\\\\rm tot}} \\\\, In the best case, the modeled values exactly match the observed values, which results in SS_\\\\text{res}=0 and R^2=1. A baseline model, which always predicts \\\\bar{y}, will have R^2=0. Models that have worse predictions than this baseline will have a negative R^2. Relation to unexplained variance In a general form, R2 can be seen to be related to the fraction of variance unexplained (FVU), since the second term compares the unexplained variance (variance of the model's errors) with the total variance (of the data): : R^2 = 1 - \\\\text{FVU} As explained variance Suppose R2 = 0.49. This implies that 49% of the variability of the dependent variable has been accounted for, and the remaining 51% of the variability is still unaccounted for. In some cases the total sum of squares equals the sum of the two other sums of squares defined above, If the regression sum of squares, also called the explained sum of squares, is given by: : SS_\\\\text{reg}=\\\\sum_i (f_i -\\\\bar{y})^2 then :SS_\\\\text{res}+SS_\\\\text{reg}=SS_\\\\text{tot} See Partitioning in the general OLS model for a derivation of this result for one case where the relation holds. When this relation does hold, the above definition of R2 is equivalent to :R^2 = \\\\frac{SS_\\\\text{reg}}{SS_\\\\text{tot}} = \\\\frac{SS_\\\\text{reg}/n}{SS_\\\\text{tot}/n} where n is the number of observations (cases) on the variables. In this form R2 is expressed as the ratio of the explained variance (variance of the model's predictions, which is SSreg / n) to the total variance (sample variance of the dependent variable, which is SStot / n). This partition of the sum of squares holds for instance when the model values ∆íi have been obtained by linear regression. A milder sufficient condition reads as follows: The model has the form :f_i=\\\\widehat\\\\alpha+\\\\widehat\\\\beta q_i \\\\, where the qi are arbitrary values that may or may not depend on i or on other free parameters (the common choice qi = xi is just one special case), and the coefficient estimates \\\\widehat\\\\alpha and \\\\widehat\\\\beta are obtained by minimizing the residual sum of squares. This set of conditions is an important one and it has a number of implications for the properties of the fitted residuals and the modelled values. In particular, under these conditions: :\\\\bar{f}=\\\\bar{y}.\\\\, As squared correlation coefficient In linear least squares multiple regression with an estimated intercept term, R2 equals the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed y and modeled (predicted) f data values of the dependent variable. In a linear least squares regression with an intercept term and a single explanator, this is also equal to the squared Pearson correlation coefficient of the dependent variable y and explanatory variable x. It should not be confused with the correlation coefficient between two estimates, defined as :\\\\rho_{\\\\widehat\\\\alpha,\\\\widehat\\\\beta} = {\\\\operatorname{cov}\\\\left(\\\\widehat\\\\alpha,\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\over \\\\sigma_{\\\\widehat\\\\alpha} \\\\sigma_{\\\\widehat\\\\beta}}, where the covariance between two coefficient estimates, as well as their standard deviations, are obtained from the covariance matrix of the coefficient estimates. Under more general modeling conditions, where the predicted values might be generated from a model different from linear least squares regression, an R2 value can be calculated as the square of the correlation coefficient between the original y and modeled f data values. In this case, the value is not directly a measure of how good the modeled values are, but rather a measure of how good a predictor might be constructed from the modeled values (by creating a revised predictor of the form Œ± + Œ≤∆íi). According to Everitt (p. 78), this usage is specifically the definition of the term \\"coefficient of determination\\": the square of the correlation between two (general) variables. Interpretation R2 is a statistic that will give some information about the goodness of fit of a model. In regression, the R2 coefficient of determination is a statistical measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points. An R2 of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data. Values of R2 outside the range 0 to 1 can occur when the model fits the data worse than a horizontal hyperplane. This would occur when the wrong model was chosen, or nonsensical constraints were applied by mistake. If equation 1 of Kv√•lseth is used (this is the equation used most often), R2 can be less than zero. If equation 2 of Kv√•lseth is used, R2 can be greater than one. In all instances where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we increase the number of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included‚Äîi.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone. This leads to the alternative approach of looking at the adjusted R2. The explanation of this statistic is almost the same as R2 but it penalizes the statistic as extra variables are included in the model. For cases other than fitting by ordinary least squares, the R2 statistic can be calculated as above and may still be a useful measure. If fitting is by weighted least squares or generalized least squares, alternative versions of R2 can be calculated appropriate to those statistical frameworks, while the \\"raw\\" R2 may still be useful if it is more easily interpreted. Values for R2 can be calculated for any type of predictive model, which need not have a statistical basis. In a multivariate linear model Consider a linear model with more than a single explanatory variable, of the form :Y_i = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^p \\\\beta_j X_{i,j} + \\\\varepsilon_i, where, for the ith case, {Y_i} is the response variable, X_{i,1},\\\\dots,X_{i,p} are p regressors, and \\\\varepsilon_i is a mean zero error term. The quantities \\\\beta_0,\\\\dots,\\\\beta_p are unknown coefficients, whose values are estimated by least squares. The coefficient of determination R2 is a measure of the global fit of the model. Specifically, R2 is an element of [0, 1] and represents the proportion of variability in Yi that may be attributed to some linear combination of the regressors (explanatory variables) in X.Computing Adjusted R2 for Polynomial Regressions R2 is often interpreted as the proportion of response variation \\"explained\\" by the regressors in the model. Thus, R2 = 1 indicates that the fitted model explains all variability in y, while R2 = 0 indicates no 'linear' relationship (for straight line regression, this means that the straight line model is a constant line (slope = 0, intercept = \\\\bar{y}) between the response variable and regressors). An interior value such as R2 = 0.7 may be interpreted as follows: \\"Seventy percent of the variance in the response variable can be explained by the explanatory variables. The remaining thirty percent can be attributed to unknown, lurking variables or inherent variability.\\" A caution that applies to R2, as to other statistical descriptions of correlation and association is that \\"correlation does not imply causation.\\" In other words, while correlations may sometimes provide valuable clues in uncovering causal relationships among variables, a non-zero estimated correlation between two variables is not, on its own, evidence that changing the value of one variable would result in changes in the values of other variables. For example, the practice of carrying matches (or a lighter) is correlated with incidence of lung cancer, but carrying matches does not cause cancer (in the standard sense of \\"cause\\"). In case of a single regressor, fitted by least squares, R2 is the square of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient relating the regressor and the response variable. More generally, R2 is the square of the correlation between the constructed predictor and the response variable. With more than one regressor, the R2 can be referred to as the coefficient of multiple determination. Inflation of R2 In least squares regression using typical data, R2 is at least weakly increasing with increases in the number of regressors in the model. Because increases in the number of regressors increase the value of R2, R2 alone cannot be used as a meaningful comparison of models with very different numbers of independent variables. For a meaningful comparison between two models, an F-test can be performed on the residual sum of squares, similar to the F-tests in Granger causality, though this is not always appropriate. As a reminder of this, some authors denote R2 by Rq2, where q is the number of columns in X (the number of explanators including the constant). To demonstrate this property, first recall that the objective of least squares linear regression is :\\\\min_b SS_\\\\text{res}(b) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\min_b \\\\sum_i (y_i - X_ib)^2\\\\, where Xi is a row vector of values of explanatory variables for case i and b is a column vector of coefficients of the respective elements of Xi. The optimal value of the objective is weakly smaller as more explanatory variables are added and hence additional columns of X (the explanatory data matrix whose ith row is Xi) are added, by the fact that less constrained minimization leads to an optimal cost which is weakly smaller than more constrained minimization does. Given the previous conclusion and noting that SS_{tot} depends only on y, the non-decreasing property of R2 follows directly from the definition above. The intuitive reason that using an additional explanatory variable cannot lower the R2 is this: Minimizing SS_\\\\text{res} is equivalent to maximizing R2. When the extra variable is included, the data always have the option of giving it an estimated coefficient of zero, leaving the predicted values and the R2 unchanged. The only way that the optimization problem will give a non-zero coefficient is if doing so improves the R2. Caveats R2 does not indicate whether: * the independent variables are a cause of the changes in the dependent variable; * omitted-variable bias exists; * the correct regression was used; * the most appropriate set of independent variables has been chosen; * there is collinearity present in the data on the explanatory variables; * the model might be improved by using transformed versions of the existing set of independent variables; * there are enough data points to make a solid conclusion. Extensions=Adjusted R2 The use of an adjusted R2 (one common notation is \\\\bar R^2, pronounced \\"R bar squared\\"; another is R^2_{\\\\text{adj}}) is an attempt to account for the phenomenon of the R2 automatically and spuriously increasing when extra explanatory variables are added to the model. Originated by Henri Theil, it is a modification of R2 that adjusts for the number of explanatory terms in a model (p) relative to the number of data points (n). The adjusted R2 is defined as :\\\\bar R^2 = 1-(1-R^2){n-1 \\\\over n-p-1} where p is the total number of explanatory variables in the model (not including the constant term), and n is the sample size. It can also be written as: :\\\\bar R^2 = {1-{SS_\\\\text{res}/\\\\text{df}_e \\\\over SS_\\\\text{tot}/\\\\text{df}_t}} where dft is the degrees of freedom n ‚Äì 1 of the estimate of the population variance of the dependent variable, and dfe is the degrees of freedom n ‚Äì p ‚Äì 1 of the estimate of the underlying population error variance. The adjusted R2 can be negative, and its value will always be less than or equal to that of R2. Unlike R2, the adjusted R2 increases only when the increase in R2 (due to the inclusion of a new explanatory variable) is more than one would expect to see by chance. If a set of explanatory variables with a predetermined hierarchy of importance are introduced into a regression one at a time, with the adjusted R2 computed each time, the level at which adjusted R2 reaches a maximum, and decreases afterward, would be the regression with the ideal combination of having the best fit without excess/unnecessary terms. Adjusted R2 can be interpreted as an unbiased (or less biased) estimator of the population R2, whereas the observed sample R2 is a positively biased estimate of the population value. Adjusted R2 is more appropriate when evaluating model fit (the variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables) and in comparing alternative models in the feature selection stage of model building. The principle behind the adjusted R2 statistic can be seen by rewriting the ordinary R2 as :R^2 = {1-{\\\\textit{VAR}_\\\\text{res} \\\\over \\\\textit{VAR}_\\\\text{tot}}} where \\\\text{VAR}_\\\\text{res} = SS_\\\\text{res}/n and \\\\text{VAR}_\\\\text{tot} = SS_\\\\text{tot}/n are the sample variances of the estimated residuals and the dependent variable respectively, which can be seen as biased estimates of the population variances of the errors and of the dependent variable. These estimates are replaced by statistically unbiased versions: \\\\text{VAR}_\\\\text{res} = SS_\\\\text{res}/(n-p-1) and \\\\text{VAR}_\\\\text{tot} = SS_\\\\text{tot}/(n-1). Coefficient of partial determination The coefficient of partial determination can be defined as the proportion of variation that cannot be explained in a reduced model, but can be explained by the predictors specified in a full(er) model.Richard Anderson-Sprecher, \\"Model Comparisons and R2\\", The American Statistician, Volume 48, Issue 2, 1994, pp. 113‚Äì117.(generalized to Maximum Likelihood) N. J. D. Nagelkerke, \\"A Note on a General Definition of the Coefficient of Determination\\", Biometrika, Vol. 78, No. 3. (Sep., 1991), pp. 691‚Äì692.\\"R implementation of coefficient of partial determination\\" This coefficient is used to provide insight into whether or not one or more additional predictors may be useful in a more fully specified regression model. The calculation for the partial R2 is relatively straightforward after estimating two models and generating the ANOVA tables for them. The calculation for the partial R2 is :\\\\frac{SS_\\\\text{ res, reduced} - SS_\\\\text{ res, full}}{SS_\\\\text{ res, reduced}}, which is analogous to the usual coefficient of determination: :\\\\frac{SS_\\\\text{tot} - SS_\\\\text{res}}{SS_\\\\text{tot}}.  Generalizing and decomposing R2  As explained above, model selection heuristics such as the Adjusted R^2 criterion and the F-test examine whether the total R^2 sufficiently increases to determine if a new regressor should be added to the model. If a regressor is added to the model that is highly correlated with other regressors which have already been included, then the total R^2 will hardly increase, even if the new regressor is of relevance. As a result, the above-mentioned heuristics will ignore relevant regressors when cross-correlations are high. Geometric representation of r^2. Alternatively, one can decompose a generalized version of R^2 to quantify the relevance of deviating from a hypothesis. As Hoornweg (2018) shows, several shrinkage estimators ‚Äì such as Bayesian linear regression, ridge regression, and the (adaptive) lasso ‚Äì make use of this decomposition of R^2 when they gradually shrink parameters from the unrestricted OLS solutions towards the hypothesized values. Let us first define the linear regression model as : y=X\\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon. It is assumed that the matrix X is standardized with Z-scores and that the column vector y is centered to have a mean of zero. Let the column vector \\\\beta_0 refer to the hypothesized regression parameters and let the column vector b denote the estimated parameters. We can then define : R^2=1-\\\\frac{(y-Xb)'(y-Xb)}{(y-X\\\\beta_0)'(y-X\\\\beta_0)}. An R^2 of 75% means that the in-sample accuracy improves by 75% if the data-optimized b solutions are used instead of the hypothesized \\\\beta_0 values. In the special case that \\\\beta_0 is a vector of zeros, we obtain the traditional R^2 again. The individual effect on R^2 of deviating from a hypothesis can be computed with R^\\\\otimes ('R-outer'). This p times p matrix is given by : R^{\\\\otimes}=(X'\\\\tilde y_0)(X'\\\\tilde y_0)' (X'X)^{-1}(\\\\tilde y_0'\\\\tilde y_0)^{-1}, where \\\\tilde y_0=y-X\\\\beta_0. The diagonal elements of R^\\\\otimes exactly add up to R^2. If regressors are uncorrelated and \\\\beta_0 is a vector of zeros, then the j^\\\\text{th} diagonal element of R^{\\\\otimes} simply corresponds to the r^2 value between x_j and y. When regressors x_i and x_j are correlated, R^\\\\otimes_{ii} might increase at the cost of a decrease in R^{\\\\otimes}_{jj}. As a result, the diagonal elements of R^{\\\\otimes} may be smaller than 0 and, in more exceptional cases, larger than 1. To deal with such uncertainties, several shrinkage estimators implicitly take a weighted average of the diagonal elements of R^{\\\\otimes} to quantify the relevance of deviating from a hypothesized value. Click on the lasso for an example.  R2 in logistic regression  In the case of logistic regression, usually fit by maximum likelihood, there are several choices of pseudo-R2. One is the generalized R2 originally proposed by Cox & Snell, and independently by Magee: : R^2 = 1 - \\\\left({ \\\\mathcal{L}(0) \\\\over \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\widehat{\\\\theta}) }\\\\right)^{2/n} where \\\\mathcal{L}(0) is the likelihood of the model with only the intercept, {\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\widehat{\\\\theta})} is the likelihood of the estimated model (i.e., the model with a given set of parameter estimates) and n is the sample size. It is easily rewritten to: : R^2 = 1 - e^{\\\\frac{2}{n} (\\\\ln(\\\\mathcal{L}(0)) - \\\\ln(\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\widehat{\\\\theta}))} = 1 - e^{-D/n} where D is the test statistic of the likelihood ratio test. Nagelkerke noted that it had the following properties: # It is consistent with the classical coefficient of determination when both can be computed; # Its value is maximised by the maximum likelihood estimation of a model; # It is asymptotically independent of the sample size; # The interpretation is the proportion of the variation explained by the model; # The values are between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting that model does not explain any variation and 1 denoting that it perfectly explains the observed variation; # It does not have any unit. However, in the case of a logistic model, where \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\widehat{\\\\theta}) cannot be greater than 1, R2 is between 0 and R^2_\\\\max = 1- (\\\\mathcal{L}(0))^{2/n} : thus, Nagelkerke suggested the possibility to define a scaled R2 as R2/R2max. Comparison with norm of residuals Occasionally, the norm of residuals is used for indicating goodness of fit. This term is calculated as the square-root of the sum of squares of residuals: :\\\\text{norm of residuals} = \\\\sqrt{SS_\\\\text{res}} = \\\\ e \\\\. Both R2 and the norm of residuals have their relative merits. For least squares analysis R2 varies between 0 and 1, with larger numbers indicating better fits and 1 representing a perfect fit. The norm of residuals varies from 0 to infinity with smaller numbers indicating better fits and zero indicating a perfect fit. One advantage and disadvantage of R2 is the SS_\\\\text{tot} term acts to normalize the value. If the yi values are all multiplied by a constant, the norm of residuals will also change by that constant but R2 will stay the same. As a basic example, for the linear least squares fit to the set of data: : \\\\begin{array}{rcrrrrr} x & = & 1, & 2, & 3, & 4, & 5 \\\\ y & = & 1.9, & 3.7, & 5.8, & 8.0, & 9.6 \\\\end{array} R2 = 0.998, and norm of residuals = 0.302. If all values of y are multiplied by 1000 (for example, in an SI prefix change), then R2 remains the same, but norm of residuals = 302. Another single-parameter indicator of fit is the RMSE of the residuals, or standard deviation of the residuals. This would have a value of 0.135 for the above example given that the fit was linear with an unforced intercept.OriginLab webpage, http://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/LR- Algorithm.

She was the second Navy ship to be named for the Dry Tortugas, a group of desert coral islets west of Key West, Florida. Tortuga was laid down on 23 March 1987, by the Avondale Shipyards, New Orleans, Louisiana. The threat of Hurricane Gilbert in the Gulf of Mexico forced an early launching of the ship, as a precautionary measure, on 15 September 1988. On 19 November 1988, Mrs. Rosemary Parker Schoultz, the ship's sponsor, presided over the christening ceremony, breaking the traditional bottle of champagne over the bow of the ship. Tortuga was commissioned on 17 November 1990. History New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. In 1997, Tortuga was commanded by CDR Kenneth M. Rome, and made a Mediterranean deployment from 1 July 1998 until 8 December 1998. In 1999, CDR J.M. Burdon assumed command and commanded the ship until his retirement in late 2000. He was succeeded by CDR James P. Driscoll, and in October 2000, the ship was ordered on an emergency deployment to support UNITAS 2000 in the South Pacific after had run aground on an underwater mountain off the coast of Valparaiso, Chile suffering catastrophic damage. After successfully finishing the UNITAS deployment, Tortuga returned to Little Creek. In January 2001, Tortuga was assigned as flagship to the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic a NATO peacekeeping/quick reaction force. In August 2002, USS Tortuga departed North Carolina with Marines and sailors from BLT 2/2. During this time she was the home to Echo Company, CAAT Red and a section of CAAT Green, as well as LAR and AmTracks. The group was on what was supposed to be a 6-month deployment. In September and October 2002, Tortuga was in Thessaloniki, Greece in support of BLT 2/2 operations in Kosovo. In November Tortuga transited the Suez Canal with the rest of her ARG. They were then assigned to the U.S. Fifth Fleet. In mid-November, Tortuga put Marines from BLT 2/2 ashore in Djibouti. She then proceeded south of the equator to the Seychelle Islands. In March 2003, Tortuga proceeded to the Persian Gulf to deploy her Marines and sailors in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Marines and sailors returned to Tortuga in April and returned to the United States on 27 May 2003 after a 9-month deployment. In 2005, Tortuga was commanded by CDR Mark H. Scovill, homeported at NAB Little Creek, Virginia, and assigned to Amphibious Group 2 of the Atlantic Fleet. On 25 August 2005 Tortuga and her crew were pulled from a training exercise and sent to New Orleans to become part of Joint Task Force Katrina. She was the first Navy ship to sail up the Mississippi River following the hurricane and berthed on the West Bank of New Orleans Naval Station. The ship instantly became a major rally point for the scattered military and civilian forces across New Orleans. Tortuga's crew conducted rescue missions in the flooded Ninth Ward and assisted local officials from St. Bernard Parish. Crew members employed combat rubber raiding craft (CRRCs) which allowed them to search flooded areas with many underwater obstacles. As the crew rescued people from neighborhoods they were brought back to Tortuga with 7 and 11 meter RHIBs. Evacuees were processed, received medical attention, and were forwarded to their next destination at the earliest possible time. As water receded in New Orleans and the CRRCs became useless, the ship served as the headquarters for the 618th ESC \\"Nasty\\", and the 307th Eng Bn, 82nd Airborne Division U.S. Army camped out on the Naval Station, while they worked in conjunction with U.S. Navy units to conduct rescue and clean up missions. On 14 October 2005, the U.S. Navy announced that Tortuga would be forward-deployed to Sasebo, Japan to replace Fort McHenry (LSD-43). Tortuga arrived in Sasebo 31 March 2006 for turnover and assignment as part of the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF). On 12 April the crews of the two ships completed an exchange-of-command process. Conducted in 12 days, the hull swap between Fort McHenry and Tortuga was the quickest in the history of the U.S. Navy. Tortuga's former crew departed Sasebo 13 April 2006 to return to Little Creek on board Fort McHenry. On 15 May, only a month following the swap, Tortuga departed for a three-month deployment. The deployment was centered around an annual exercise called Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2006. Tortuga joined a newly established task group (TG 73.5) reporting directly to Commander, Logistics Group WESTPAC out of Singapore. The group consisted of five ships, Tortuga, , , , and . The group visited and operated with the navies of Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Philippines. USS Tortuga visited the island of Iwo Jima in March 2008 and March 2010 to celebrate the anniversary of the World War II battle fought there.

Considered an extension of the Appalachian mountain chain, the Highlands comprise the northern portions of Inverness and Victoria counties. The Highlands are surrounded by water with the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the Cabot Strait to the north and east, the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the north and west, and Bras d'Or Lake to the south. Elevations average 350 metres at the edges of the plateau (i.e. at the above- mentioned water bodies), and rise to more than 500 metres at the centre, including the highest elevation point in the province at White Hill. The plateau consists of numerous broad, gently rolling hills bisected with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons. The southern and western edges of the plateau give way to broad valleys with soils resulting from glaciation, providing some of Cape Breton's best agricultural lands. Most of the interior and southern edges of the plateau are covered with damp, cool deciduous forests which makes for spectacular colours during autumn foliage. Southward facing slopes above 300 metres in elevation generally only support Balsam Fir, as a result of the short growing season and harsh winter climate. The northern and western edges of the plateau, particularly at high elevations, resemble arctic tundra. The west coast of the Highlands meets the Gulf of St. Lawrence in steep cliffs whereas the east coast borders the Atlantic Ocean with a gently sloping coastal plain, low headlands, and several beaches. In 1936 the federal government established the Cape Breton Highlands National Park covering 950 km¬≤ across the northern third of the Highlands. The Cabot Trail scenic highway also encircles the coastal perimeter of the plateau. While the coastal areas of Inverness and Victoria counties along the plateau are home to several dozen small fishing and tourism-related communities, the interior of the plateau has no public roads and very little human presence, making it one of Nova Scotia's largest wilderness areas. Wreck Cove Hydroelectric System is the largest hydroelectric plant in Nova Scotia with a generating capacity of 215.8 MW.

Several examples were built for this role, as well as a small batch to be used in the long-range reconnaissance role. Development and design The design started in response to a 1936 request by Lufthansa, which planned a route over the Pamir Mountains in Afghanistan. This was the primary difficulty in producing an aircraft able to meet the range requirements, because the aircraft would have to lift its large fuel load to to clear the mountains. At the time there were simply no engines available with that sort of altitude performance, although Hirth was working on one in the class. The G√ºnter brothers proposed to adapt their basic He 70 Blitz airframe to carry four of these engines to provide enough power for the massive fuel load. The He 116 would use a modified version of the He 70's two-spar elliptical planform, skinned (like the He 70) with plywood. The fuselage was all-new, consisting of a semi-monocoque duralumin body with watertight bulkheads in case the aircraft were forced down over water. The design shared enough construction with the He 70 that the first prototype He 116 V1 was completed in early 1937. The new engines were not ready at this point, so the prototype was instead fitted with the much smaller Hirth HM 508C of .

Six additional aircraft based on the V7 pattern were then ordered, designated He 116B-0, although they also received prototype numbers V9 to V14. The B-0 s were intended to operate at extremely long range, outside the range of enemy fighters, and therefore had no defensive armament fitted. All eight (V7 through V14) were issued to reconnaissance units prior to the war, but by that time the idea of a slow-moving unarmed plane providing any useful information seemed unlikely. Instead they were used over German territory providing mapping services. ;He 116R:V3 was removed from the line to be converted into a record-breaking prototype. The modifications included a larger wing with a span, and increased fuel tankage in the fuselage. The Hirth HM 508H engines provided a better fuel economy through operation at lower rpm. For take-offs with maximum fuel the He 116R, Rostock, was fitted with four RATO units. On its first record flight attempt one of the rockets tore loose and hit the wing, requiring extensive repairs.

The population in 2011 was 8,866,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 16.96 km2.Eurostat It is the most populous and most densely populated parish in the municipality. It contains the localities Charco, Cust√≥dio, Labardas, Nogueira, Pico da Madeira, Pico da Varanda, Pico do Bode, Pico do Refugio, Rebent√£o, Santana, S√£o Sebasti√£o, Senhora da Concei√ß√£o and Tulha. History It is uncertain when the territory was settled, although it is assumed that the settlement of Ribeira Grande may have directly affected colonization of the area. Local sources put the colonization at around the 15th century, by Flemish and Moorish settlers. Its toponomy was first defined by Father Gaspar Frutuoso during the 16th century, who reflected on the fact that the area received its name owing to the physical topography. As he indicated, the terrestrial physiography, and specifically the land around one of its bays resembled a fish tail, or in Portuguese rabo de peixe (literally tail of the fish). Similarly, another reference by the priest and chronicler indicated that the area was also known for the discovery of the tail of a large unknown species of fish, and may have received its name from this legendary account. The Church of Senhor Bom Jesus was constructed in the 18th century: the project was started in 1690 and concluded in 1735 in the Baroque style typical of the islands. In the locality of Santana, a fertile plain that extends from Rabo de Peixe until the edge of the town of Ribeira Grande was used during the era of the Second World War as a military airfield. Following 1946, it was transformed into the islands first civilian airport, before being abandoned in favour of the Ponta Delgada-Nordela air strip along the southern coast. Rabo de Peixe was elevated to the status of town on 25 April 2004. Owing to the importance of the port the economy and life of the civil parish, on the 19 August 2012, then-president Carlos Cesar announced the remodelling and extension of the port facility, which includes two new wings: a southern dock, and the a northern dock, that runs perpendicular. The project who allow the shelter of ships and equipment within a area. In addition, the port facility would include a floating dock and three piers, in addition to expansion of port facilities to include ramps and docks for the repair of boats, fish-houses and a new roadway that would circle the complex (linked to the main roadway). Economy Essentially, the parish's economy is driven by primary resource production that includes fishing and agriculture, with secondary industries associated with these sectors, including civil construction, fish-processing and some milk-processing facilities. Culture Owing to its history, Rabo de Peixe is an area of strong heritage and cultural traditions, that includes traditional festivals, folklore, music and a large architectural patrimony. The religious festivals are valued by the local population, and attract many visitors throughout the year. The begin immediately on the first day of the New Year, with the ‚Äò‚ÄôFesta do Senhor Bom Jesus‚Äô‚Äô, the patron saint, but also include the devotional celebrations associated with the Holy Spirit throughout the summer after Pentecosts. The ‚Äò‚ÄôFesta da Bandeiras‚Äô‚Äô (literally ‚Äò‚ÄôFestival of the Flags‚Äô‚Äô) is one of the more expressive celebrations and includes both the commemorations of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFestas da Benefic√™ncia‚Äô‚Äô (associated with the ‚Äò‚ÄôFlag of Charity‚Äô‚Äô) and the ‚Äò‚ÄôFestas da Caridade‚Äô‚Äô (analogous with the ‚Äò‚ÄôFlag of the Holy Trinity‚Äô‚Äô). Accompanying these flags are the ‚Äò‚ÄôDespensas‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôBailinhos‚Äô‚Äô, two dances typical of the historical Rabo de Peixe. There are six coronations associated with the celebrations to the Holy Spirit in Rabo de Peixe: S√£o Sebasti√£o, S√£o Jo√£o, S√£o Pedro, Dos Inocentes, Sant√≠ssima Trindade and Ros√°rio. On the first Sunday in October is the celebration of the Feast of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio (‚Äò‚ÄôOur Lady of the Rosary‚Äô‚Äô), marked by a ceremonial procession through the town. The following day, there is also procession which winds through the main roads, which is comparable to the procession through the streets of Ponta Delgada during the festival of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres. Celebrations in honour of Santa Cec√≠lia and Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o, patron saints of the local philharmonic bands also result in processions, as well as the processions celebrating S√£o Sebasti√£o (on the second-to-last Sunday of January), Senhor dos Passos (third Sunday after Easter), Ramos (Sunday following Easter), Senhor Morto (evening of Good Friday), Senhor Ressuscitado (Easter Sunday), Enfermos (first Sunday after Easter) and S√£o Pedro Gon√ßalves (on the sixth Sunday after Easter). The feasts of the Holy Spirit () include the folkloric ‚Äò‚ÄôDespensas‚Äô‚Äô (a local dance) that is different then the traditional dances on the island, that include the ‚Äò‚ÄôBalho dos Homens da Terra‚Äô‚Äô and the ‚Äò‚ÄôBalho dos Homens do Mar‚Äô‚Äô, which are danced solely by men, accompanied by castanhetas. Throughout the dance women do participate, but they never begin the dance with the men. The two philharmonic bands of Rabo de Peixe both have a century of existence: the ‚Äò‚ÄôSociedade Filarm√≥nica Lira do Norte‚Äô‚Äô (founded in 1867) and the ‚Äò‚ÄôFilarm√≥nica Progresso do Norte‚Äô‚Äô (established in 1888).

It is surrounded by the Little Dolomites (Italian Prealps) and Mount Pasubio. History Its name comes from Latin: escletum was a wood of oaks and it was first used in a document of some Benedictines from Vicenza. The first settlements were around two old hills, where now there are respectively the ruins of an old castle and a majestic neoclassical cathedral. By the 12th century Schio had become an important centre of prosperous wool manufacturing. The city was ruled by the Venetian Maltraversi family until 1311. Schio is now an industrial town thanks to Alessandro Rossi, who founded the biggest Italian wool firm (Lanerossi) in the 19th century. Rossi also arranged the building of houses, nurseries, schools, theatres and gardens for his workers. The most important textile factories in Schio were Lanerossi, Conte and Cazzola. Schio was called \\"Manchester of Italy\\", because it was the focal point of the northern wool trade like the British city. After World War II, the Italian resistance movement committed the Schio massacre in a temporary prison building in July 1945, killing 54 inmates. Main sights *The Weaver‚Äôs Monument, erected in 1879 by Alessandro Rossi who dedicated it to his workers. The inhabitants of Schio call it L‚ÄôOmo (a dialect word for \\"man\\").

The church is now part of a complex of buildings, superimposed in time, which were used formerly by the Monastery dei Frati Minori (1437-1806) and then by Schio's civil hospital (the Baratto Institute 1807-1959) and now a home for the elderly. *The little church of St Mary in the Valley, originally a column erected in 1511 after a plague. It became a church in 1580. *Toaldi-Capra Palace. This building dates from the 15th century or earlier; some frescoes have been recovered in the interior. It first belonged to the Toaldi family; it then passed to Enrico Capra, a noble from Vicenza, before becoming the Town Hall until 1913. It was recovered and carefully restored in 1981, and now houses the civic Musical Institute as a centre for cultural activities.

Retrieved: 2012-04-09. is a river in the northwest of Ireland. Name Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called ŒõŒπŒ≤ŒΩŒπŒøœÖ (Libniu, perhaps from *lei- \\"flow\\") which probably referred to the River Moy. The Moy is first named in Adomn√°n's Life of Columba (c. 700) as Modam fluvium. Later spellings include Muaide, Muadam, M√∫ed, M√∫aid; the name An Mhuaidh is used in modern Irish. The name is possibly derived from the Old Irish word muad, meaning \\"noble.\\"  Geography  The Moy rises at the foot of the Ox Mountains in County Sligo. It flows for . For the greater part of its length, it flows southwestward, entering County Mayo and passing near Swinford before passing throgh foxford then turning north near the village of Kilmore and heading for the town of Ballina, where it enters the Atlantic Ocean at Killala Bay. The Moy Estuary is long beginning at Ballina and running into Killala Bay. The catchment area of the River Moy is 2,086 km2. The long term average flow rate of the River Moy into Killala Bay is 61.5 cubic metres per second (m3/s) The Moy valley, with its ancient churches and abbeys, is a prominent tourist destination.  Economics  The river was once among the best salmon fisheries in Europe; however, in recent times, drift net fishing off the coast caused a huge decline in salmon numbers. According to central fisheries board statistics, 101,231 returning salmon were taken by drift nets off the west coast of Ireland in 2005. In the same year, 29% (6,675) of all rod-caught salmon in Ireland were taken in the Ballina district as a result of a weir which keeps salmon trapped in the ridge pool near the mouth of the river during the summer. Drift netting for salmon was banned in November 2006 and the ban came into force on 1 January 2007.

The National Monument of Scotland, on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, is Scotland's national memorial to the Scottish soldiers and sailors who died fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. It was intended, according to the inscription, to be \\"A Memorial of the Past and Incentive to the Future Heroism of the Men of Scotland\\". The monument dominates the top of Calton Hill, just to the east of Princes Street. It was designed during 1823‚Äì6 by Charles Robert Cockerell and William Henry Playfair and is modelled upon the Parthenon in Athens. Construction started in 1826 and, due to the lack of funds, was left unfinished in 1829. This circumstance gave rise to various nicknames such as \\"Scotland's Folly\\", \\"Edinburgh's Disgrace\\", \\"the Pride and Poverty of Scotland\\" and \\"Edinburgh's Folly\\".  Proposals As early as 1816, the Highland Society of Scotland called for the construction of a national monument to commemorate the fallen in the Napoleonic Wars. Initially The Mound was considered as a site, but was rejected in favour of Calton Hill. In January 1822, a proposal was put forward to 'erect a facsimile of the Parthenon' at a cost of some ¬£42,000. The appeal found support amongst many prominent Edinburgh residents such as Sir Walter Scott, Henry, Lord Cockburn and Francis, Lord Jeffrey. In July 1822 the Royal Association of Contributors to the National Monument of Scotland was incorporated by an Act of Parliament. The foundation stone was laid, amid great pomp and ceremony, the following month. Drawing of the front elevation of the Western Portico of the National Monument of Scotland, by William Henry Playfair, dated 1826 Sixteen months after the initial appeal, only ¬£16,000 had been found with the possibility of a ¬£10,000 grant from Parliament. In 1826, the building was finally commissioned and work began. The builder contracted to execute the work was Messrs William Wallace & Son. Originally, the building was planned to have extensive catacombs in the area supporting the main structure, to provide a burial place for significant figures, intended as a \\"Scottish Valhalla\\". A minute of the Royal Association in 1826 stated that the building was: Laying of the foundation stone The foundation stone, which weighs 6 tons, was laid on 27 August 1822, during the visit of George IV to Scotland. The Duke of Hamilton (the most senior non-royal Scottish noble and the Grand Master of Scotland) led a procession of masonic lodges, royal commissioners and other dignitaries from Parliament Square to the top of Calton Hill. The procession was escorted by the Scots Greys and the 3rd Dragoons. The deposition of the inscription plates in the stone was accompanied by cannon salutes from Edinburgh Castle, Salisbury Crags, Leith Fort and the royal squadron on Leith Roads. Ideas for completion Early proposals for completion work tended to focus on following the original plans; however, during the early 20th century several alternative plans were proposed: * as a monument to Queen Victoria (1901) * as a monument commemorating the 1707 Act of Union with England (1907) * as a new Scottish National Gallery (1907) * as a Scottish Parliament building (1908) * as a memorial to those who fell in the Great War (1918, George Washington Browne) Subsequent attempts to 'complete' the National Monument have never borne fruit for reasons of either cost or lack of local enthusiasm. A proposal in 2004 met with a mixed reception. The monument was repaired in December 2008, repositioning one of the stone lintels that had moved out of alignment. The cost was ¬£100,262.Edinburgh World Heritage Annual Review 2008-09, p.16Edinburgh World Heritage, National Monument Protection The National Monument was classified as a Category A Listed building in 1966.

However, the application is required to be filled using Form 49AA meant for foreign citizens and submitted at any of the authorized PAN Service Centre through the authorized representative in India. List of documents applicable for foreign citizens are given below: Individuals and HUF Documents accepted as proof of identity # Copy of passport, or Voter's ID card # Copy of Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card issued by Government of India, # Copy of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card issued by Government of India, # Copy of other national or citizenship Identification Number or Taxpayer Identification Number duly attested by \\"Apostille\\" (in respect of countries which are signatories to the Hague Convention of 1961) or by the Indian Embassy or High Commission or Consulate in the country where the applicant is located or authorised officials of overseas branches of Scheduled Banks registered in India (in prescribed format) .

At present, PAN Service Centres are located in India only. However, foreign citizens may find online mode of application more convenient when the klunky web user interface is working. The online facility allows payment of fees using credit card option for foreign citizens (but only if they have India based credit card as international credit cards are not always accepted by the third party fee collectors.) Unlike most countries, India charges a fee to issue a TIN (PAN ID). The fees charges are ‚Çπ107 if the PAN card is to be received in India and ‚Çπ989 if the PAN Card is to be received at a foreign location. Note that online application only eliminates data entry errors. One still needs to mail the application with photographs to India- based centers. The application requires two photographs. One on the top right requires signature within the box below it. The other one on the top left requires signature across the photograph (such that part of signature is on the photograph and part on the form). There is anywhere from 2 to 20 days lag between your documents reaching the center and the initial processing/verification which only takes a day. The actual issue of PAN number by the tax department is within 48 hours. The actual PAN card is sent to the overseas address by the registered/certified mail and may take additional 2 weeks after the issue of the PAN number which is initially conveyed by email. Although there are only 58 million income tax payers in India, yet there are 445 million genuine PANs issued as of 31 March 2019. While the alphanumeric PAN number is unique, individuals and corporate entities have been able to obtain multiple PAN cards fraudulently. It is illegal to obtain multiple PANs and there is a penalty of when caught. In addition, there are fake PAN cards due to ubiquitous plastic card printers.Tax evaders seen holding multiple PAN cards.

Etymology View over Edinburgh, with the Dugald Stewart Monument in the foreground In 1456, James II granted land to Edinburgh by charter wherein Calton Hill is referred to as \\"Cragingalt\\", the name by which it appears on the 1560 Petworth map of the Siege of Leith (rendered as \\"Cragge Ingalt\\"). The name may have derived from Old Welsh or Old English meaning \\"the place of the groves\\". The records of South Leith Parish Church name \\"Caldtoun\\" as one of the quarters of the parish in 1591, though the village and area are otherwise generally referred to as \\"Craigend\\", signifying the main land form (crags) at the western end of the feudal barony of Restalrig, as opposed to the distinguishing feature at its eastern end, a loch, hence the name Lochend. The name \\"Caldtoun\\" (sometimes anglicised as \\"Cold town\\") remained general until about 1700; the names Calton and Caltonhill first appearing when Wester Restalrig was sold to Edinburgh in 1725. The Armstrongs' map of the Three Lothians (1773) still uses the name \\"Caldtoun\\" and Ainslie's maps of Edinburgh record a change in spelling from Caltoun to Calton between 1780 and 1804. History The National Monument on Calton Hill There was possibly a prehistoric hillfort on Calton Hill and an area used for quarrying (the Quarry Holes at the eastern end). By his charter of 1456, James II granted the community of Edinburgh the valley and the low ground between Calton Hill and Greenside for performing tournaments, sports and other warlike deeds. This was part of his policy of military preparedness that saw the Act of 1457 banning golf and football and ordering archery practice every Sunday. This natural amphitheatre was also used for open-air theatre and saw performances of the early Scots play \\"Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis\\" by Sir David Lyndsay. In May 1518 the Carmelite Friars (also known as White Friars and locally based at South Queensferry), were granted lands by charter from the city at Greenside and built a small monastery there. Monasteries were abandoned following the Scottish Reformation of 1560, and the Calton Hill monastery therefore stood empty before conversion in 1591 into a hospital for lepers, founded by John Robertson, a city merchant.Calton Hill Grant, James \\"Old and New Edinburgh\\" Volume 3, Chapter XVI, printed as a periodical in the 1880s, Accessed 12 August 2009 So severe were the regulations that escape, or even the opening of the gate of the hospital between sunset and sunrise, would incur the penalty of death carried out on the gallows erected at the gate. The monastery would appear to have been located at the north-east end of Greenside Row and its site is shown there on the 1931 Ordnance Survey maps. Ten skeletons found in July 2009 during roadworks to create a new tramway in Leith Walk (later cancelled but currently undergoing public consultation ) are believed to have been connected with the hospital.Skeletons removed from Edinburgh street Washerwomen on Calton Hill (1825) The Calton area was owned by the Logan family of Restalrig but their lands were forfeited in 1609 following the posthumous sentence of treason on Robert Logan. The lands of Restalrig and Calton, otherwise known as Easter and Wester Restalrig, passed to the Elphinstone family. Sir James Elphinstone was made Lord Balmerino in 1604 and in 1673 the lands of Restalrig and Calton were erected into a single barony. In 1725, the western side of Calton Hill was disjoined and sold to the royal burgh of Edinburgh. The eastern end was owned by the charitable institution of Heriot's Trust. Calton remained a burgh of barony (although it was not administered as such) until it was formally incorporated into Edinburgh by the Municipality Extension Act of 1856. In 1631, the then Lord Balmerino granted a charter to The Society of the Incorporated Trades of Calton forming a society or corporation. This also gave the Society the exclusive right to trade within Calton and the right to tax others who wished to do so. Normally the trades of burghs were separately incorporated, for example in the Canongate there were eight incorporations, but the Incorporated Trades of Calton allowed any tradesman to become a member providing they were healthy and their work was of an acceptable standard. This lack of restrictive practices allowed a thriving trade to develop. The village of Calton was situated at the bottom of the ravine at the western end of Calton Hill (hence its earlier name of Craigend), on the road from Leith Wynd in Edinburgh and North Back of Canongate to Leith Walk and also to Broughton and thence the Western Road to Leith. In the village, the street was variously known as St. Ninian's Row or Low Calton. Many of the old buildings here were demolished at the time of the Waterloo Place and Regent Bridge development, which bridged the ravine, from 1816. The remaining old village houses of the Low Calton were removed in the 1970s. Calton was in South Leith Parish and Calton people went to church in Leith. The churchyard there was inconveniently situated for burials from Calton and, in 1718, the Society bought a half acre of land at a cost of ¬£1013 from Lord Balmerino for use as a burial ground. This became known as Old Calton Burial Ground. Permission was granted for an access road, originally known as High Calton and now the street called Calton Hill, up the steep hill from the village to the burial ground. The group of 1760s houses near the top of this street are all that remain of the old village. In 1787, the artist Robert Barker, inspired by walking on the hill created the world's first panorama - an immersive 360 degree view depicting Edinburgh from the tower of the City Observatory at the summit of Calton Hill. Buildings and structures Royal Terrace, Edinburgh The Old Calton Burial Ground was the first substantial development on Calton Hill and lies on the south-western side of the hill. The philosopher David Hume is buried there. His tomb is engraved only with the year of his birth (1711) and death (1776), on the \\"simple Roman tomb\\" (a relatively large monument) which he prescribed. The Political Martyrs' Monument is also in the burial ground. This is in memory of five campaigners for political reform and universal suffrage who were convicted of sedition and sent in 1793 to Botany Bay, Australia. On the west side of Calton Hill is the street named Calton Hill.

Edinburgh from the Calton Hill with Calton Jail in foreground, by George Washington Wilson, albumen print, ca. 1865-1895 Calton Hill was the location of the notorious Calton Jail, a complex comprising a Debtors' Prison, the Bridewell (1791‚Äì96) by Robert Adam (later replaced) and a Felons' Prison of 1815-17 by Archibald Elliot. The prisons were replaced by Saughton Prison and demolished in 1930 providing a site for St. Andrew's House, home to Scotland's senior civil servants. The sole surviving building is the castellated and turreted Governor's House by Elliot. The lower curtain walls of the prison are still visible on the south side of St. Andrew's House, above Calton Road. The eastern end of the ornate Regent Bridge is built into the side of the hill, crossing a deep gorge (at the bottom of which the opening scene from Trainspotting was shot) to connect the hill with Princes Street, now Edinburgh's main shopping street. The engineer in charge of building Regent Bridge in 1815 was Robert Stevenson, grandfather of the author Robert Louis Stevenson. By the 1840s, a pipeline ran over the shoulder of Calton hill from the Edinburgh coal gas works on the Royal Mile at New Street to the Bonnington Chemical Works in Bonnington. The gasworks waste was pumped through the line and processed into useful products at Bonnington. New Town. The renowned Scottish architect William Henry Playfair was responsible for the elegant thoroughfare that encircles the hill on three sides. Comprising Royal Terrace, Carlton Terrace and Regent Terrace, the largest of the townhouses can be found on Royal Terrace. Playfair's plan is dated 1819 and the first house was built at what is now 40 Royal Terrace. Regent Gardens that cover over one half of the summit of the hill are privately administered by the local residents' association. Carlton Terrace was originally called Carlton (or Carleton) Place but changed in 1842 to fit in with the other Terraces. Most of the properties on the terraces are occupied as houses but on Royal Terrace there is a number of hotels, by far the largest being the Crowne Plaza HotelThe Royal Terrace Hotel Accessed 6 August 2009 while on Regent Terrace is located the United States Consulate. Royal Terrace with its views over Leith and the Firth of Forth was popular with early owners who were shipowners and traders in Leith. Some of these were involved in the whisky trade, Leith being a centre for whisky blending and storage, and for a time in the 19th century the street was known as Whisky Row. Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me (the elder son of Charles X of France, last of the Bourbon kings) and his wife Marie-Th√©r√®se- Charlotte, (the daughter of Louis XVI of France and Marie Antoinette), moved into what is now 22 (then 21) Regent Terrace in 1830.

Playfair was responsible for many of the monumental structures on the summit of the hill, most notably the Scottish National Monument. This monument was intended to be another Parthenon and to commemorate Scottish Soldiers killed in the Napoleonic wars. Construction started in 1826 but work was stopped in 1829 when the building was only partially built due to lack of money. It has never been completed. For many years this failure to complete led to its being nicknamed \\"Scotland's Disgrace\\" but this name has waned given the time elapsed since the Napoleonic Wars and it is now accepted for what it is. The Royal High School was built on the southern slopes in 1829, forming an iconic part of Edinburgh's skyline. In the 1840s a tunnel was added through the lower south side of the hill (under the High School) taking tracks eastward from the newly built Waverley Station. The west end of the tunnel was remodelled and a second tunnel built in 1902 by Robert Inglis. \\"Rock House\\", which overlooks Waterloo Place at the south- western entrance to the hill, was the home of Robert Adamson who in partnership with David Octavius Hill pioneered the calotype process of photography in Scotland in the 1840s. Many of their subjects were photographed in the house and its garden. At the foot of the southern access steps is a memorial to three 19th-century Scottish singers, John Wilson (1800‚Äì1849), John Templeton (1802‚Äì1886), and David Kennedy (1825‚Äì1886).

However, Donald Dewar, then Secretary of State for Scotland, considered the site a \\"nationalist shibboleth\\", and the nearby St Andrew's House buildings (which at that time were the base of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the former Scottish Office) to look \\"Nazi\\" like \\"Dresden\\" (sic). It was also the venue in October 2004 for the Declaration of Calton Hill which outlined the demands for a future Scottish republic.

Illegal activities Calton Hill has been the focus of considerable police and local media interest.

But from the start, the bureau's visionary founding director, John Wesley Powell, promoted a broader mission: \\"to organize anthropologic research in America.\\" Under Powell, the bureau organized research-intensive multi-year projects; sponsored ethnographic, archaeological and linguistic field research; initiated publications series (most notably its Annual Reports and Bulletins); and promoted the fledgling discipline of anthropology. It prepared exhibits for expositions and collected anthropological artifacts for the Smithsonian United States National Museum. In addition, the BAE was the official repository of documents concerning American Indians collected by the various US geological surveys, especially the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region and the Geological Survey of the Territories. It developed a manuscript repository, library and illustrations section that included photographic work and the collection of photographs. In 1897, the Bureau of Ethnology's name changed to the Bureau of American Ethnology to emphasize the geographic limit of its interests, although its staff briefly conducted research in US possessions such as Hawaii and the Philippines. In 1965, the BAE merged with the Smithsonian's Department of Anthropology to form the Smithsonian Office of Anthropology within the United States National Museum (now the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History). In 1968, the SOA archives became the National Anthropological Archives. Research The BAE's staff included some of America's earliest field anthropologists, including Frank Hamilton Cushing, James Owen Dorsey, Jesse Walter Fewkes, Alice Cunningham Fletcher, John N.B. Hewitt, Francis LaFlesche, Cosmos and Victor Mindeleff, James Mooney, William Henry Holmes, Edward Palmer, James Stevenson, and Matilda Coxe Stevenson. In the 20th century, the BAE's staff included such anthropologists as John Peabody Harrington (a linguist who spent more than 40 years documenting endangered languages), Matthew Stirling, and William C. Sturtevant. The BAE supported the work of many non-Smithsonian researchers (known as collaborators), most notably Franz Boas, Frances Densmore, Garrick Mallery, Washington Matthews, Paul Radin, Cyrus Thomas and T.T. Waterman. The BAE had three subunits: the Mounds Survey (1882‚Äì1895); the Institute of Social Anthropology (1943‚Äì1952), and the River Basin Surveys (1946‚Äì1969). Mounds survey At the time the BAE was founded, there was intense controversy over the identity of the Mound Builders, the term for the prehistoric people who had built complex, monumental earthwork mounds. Archaeologists, both amateur and professional, were divided between believing the mounds were built by passing groups of people who settled in various places elsewhere, or believing they could have been built by Native Americans. Cyrus Thomas, the Bureau's appointed head of the Division of Mound Exploration, eventually published his conclusions on the origins of the mounds in the Bureau's Annual Report of 1894. It is considered to be the last word in the controversy over the Mound builders' identities. After Thomas' publication, scholars generally accepted that varying cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples, Native Americans, were the Mound builders.

The most common purpose is to have several versions of a scene within one film, without having to store the entire film on the disc several times. A popular example is the Platinum Edition DVD of The Lion King, where the user can select between the original theatrical version and an extended version. The two versions differ only in one scene (the \\"morning report\\"). The DVD player is instructed to play the film normally up to this scene, then jump to the appropriate scene as selected by the user before the commencement of the film, and then jump back to play the rest of the film. The user normally does not notice this jump, hence the word seamless. Larger scale examples of the same technique are seen in the 2000 Ultimate Edition DVD of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the 2007 DVD rerelease of Blade Runner and the Platinum and Diamond Edition DVDs of Beauty and the Beast in which three different cuts of the films are playable from the same discs. Another possible use of seamless branching is for the localisation (translation) of on-screen visible text. The Star Wars DVDs with their opening crawl are a prime example. Normally, only the audio track of films is translated into other languages, but when text central to the plot is visible on-screen, the scene may be created once for every language, and the DVD player can be instructed to select the appropriate version of the scene depending on the user's language preference. However, for this purpose a technique called multi-angle is used more often.

Uncle Oscar and Bassett both place large bets on the horses Paul names. After more winnings, Paul and Oscar arrange to give the mother a gift of five thousand pounds but the gift only lets her spend more. Disappointed, Paul tries harder than ever to be \\"lucky\\". As the Derby approaches, Paul is determined to learn the winner. Concerned about his health, his mother rushes home from a party and discovers his secret. He has been spending hours riding his rocking horse, sometimes all night long, until he \\"gets there\\", into a clairvoyant state where he can be sure of the winner's name. Paul remains ill through the day of the Derby. Informed by Cresswell, Bassett has placed Paul's bet on Malabar, at fourteen to one. When he is informed by Bassett that he now has 80,000 pounds, Paul says to his mother: > I never told you, mother, that if I can ride my horse, and get there, then > I'm absolutely sure ‚Äì oh absolutely! Mother, did I ever tell you? I am > lucky! > \\"No, you never did\\", said his mother. > But the boy died in the night. > And even as he lay dead, his mother heard her brother's voice saying to her, > \\"My God, Hester, you're eighty-odd thousand to the good, and a poor devil of > a son to the bad. But, poor devil, poor devil, he's best gone out of a life > where he rides his rocking-horse to find a winner.\\" Characters Paul: A young boy who notices that his mother doesn't love him and his sisters, even though she \\"adores\\" them.Lawrence, D. H. \\"The Rocking- Horse Winner.\\" The Story and Its Writer. Ed. Anna Charters. Compact 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2011. 525-36. Print. When he receives a rocking horse for Christmas, he rides it often and comes to find that he can predict what horse is going to win the next big horse race. Hester: Paul's mother. She becomes \\"dissatisfied with her marriage\\" when she finds that her husband is not lucky and doesn't make enough money.Cummings, Michael J. \\"The Rocking- Horse Winner: a Study Guide.\\" Free Study Guides for Shakespeare and Other Authors. 2008.

Provided the money that Paul used to make his first win at the horse race. Signed the lawyer papers for Paul's mother to receive \\"one thousand pounds at a time, on the mother's birthday, for the next five years\\". Oscar becomes partners with Paul and Bassett.  Themes  Lawrence suggests through his story that materialism and love cannot coexist. Hester pressures Paul to satisfy her materialistic desires. By demonstrating the lack of love in materialism, Lawrence suggests that external sources like money and luck cannot bring one happiness; instead, happiness must come from within. The juxtaposition of Hester's greed with Paul's generosity highlights the dichotomy between materialism and love.

He was also several times a member of the Parliament of England.  Family  Edward Hall, born in 1497, was the son of John Hall (died 22 February 1528) of Northall in Kynnersley, Shropshire, a London grocer and Merchant of the Staple who resided in the parish of St Mildred in the Poultry.Catherine Gedding (died 1557), A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: G, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 24 June 2013. The surname Hall appears in the records of the Worshipful Company of Grocers for several generations prior to Hall's birth, suggesting that members of the family had been London merchants for some time. Hall's father served as Warden of the Grocers in 1512. According to some sources, Hall's mother, Katherine Geddyng, was the daughter and coheir of Thomas Geddyng of Norfolk,Harding states, on p. 279, that Katherine's father was from Norfolk; however, on p. 280, he states that Katherine was from Lackford, Suffolk. while according to others she was the daughter of John Geddyng, great-grandson of William Geddyng of Lackford, Suffolk, and Mirabel Aspale, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Aspale. Katherine (n√©e Geddying) Hall's burial on 19 June 1557 in the church of St Benet Sherehog was recorded by the diarist Henry Machyn.A London Provisioner‚Äôs Chronicle, 1550‚Äì1563, by Henry Machyn Retrieved 26 June 2013. She appointed as executor of her will Sir William Garrard, and as supervisor Dame Joan Warren, the second wife of Sir Ralph Warren, Lord Mayor of London. According to some sources, Katherine was the 'Mistress Hall' who in 1555 was imprisoned in Newgate for her faith under Queen Mary Tudor, and with whom the religious reformer John Bradford corresponded.A London Provisioner‚Äôs Chronicle, 1550‚Äì1563, by Henry Machyn Retrieved 24 June 2013.Letter from John Bradford to Mistress Hall, prisoner in Newgate, John Foxe‚Äôs The Acts and Monuments Online Retrieved 24 June 2013. Hall had a brother, William, who survived him, but no other known brothers or sisters.  Marriage and issue  There is no evidence as to whether Hall ever married. His will, made in 1546‚Äì1547, makes no mention of a wife or children, and the only family members named are his brother, William, whom he appoints as executor of his will, and his mother, whom he appoints as overseer. In his will he requested burial in the Greyfriars, London, but he was instead buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, which was subsequently destroyed in the Great Fire of London and not rebuilt. He left all his books in French and English to his brother, William, and his manuscript of his chronicle to Richard Grafton, entrusting him with its publication.  Career  Hall began his education at Eton College. In 1514 he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1518. At about the time of Hall's graduation from university, the second son of Robert Fabyan (died 1513) became apprentice to Hall's father, and according to Herman, it was perhaps through this connection that Hall developed what became a lifelong interest in chronicling the events of English history. Hall was a student at Gray's Inn by 1521, and became a lawyer by profession. He was Autumn Reader at his Inn in 1533, and Lent Reader in 1540. According to Herman, Hall may have been first elected to Parliament as early as 1523. He was elected to represent Much Wenlock in 1529, and represented the borough again in 1539.According to Harding, however, the constituency Hall represented in 1539 is unknown. In 1542, and again in 1545, he was elected for Bridgnorth. Hall served as Common Serjeant of London from 17 March 1533 to 2 June 1535, and as Under-Sheriff from 2 June 1535 until his death.  Chronicle  Henry VIII from John of Gaunt and Edmund of Langley Hall's best-known work, The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancastre and Yorke, commonly called Hall's Chronicle, was published by the printer Richard Grafton in 1548, the year after Hall's death. A revised edition (printed for Grafton by Richard Jugge) appeared in 1550. Both included a continuation from 1532 compiled by Grafton from the author's notes.The claim that Hall published an earlier edition of the Chronicle in 1542 is now discredited. The only complete modern edition, entitled Hall's Chronicle, Containing the History of England During the Reign of Henry IV and the Succeeding Monarchs to the End of the Reign of Henry VIII, was prepared under the supervision of Sir Henry Ellis and published in 1809. A reprint was issued in 1965. In 1904, the concluding chapter dealing with the reign of Henry VIII was edited by Charles Whibley. The Chronicle begins with the accession of Henry IV to the English throne in 1399; it follows the strife between the houses of Lancaster and York, and with Grafton's continuation carries the story down to the death of Henry VIII in 1547. Hall presents the policy of this king in a very favourable light and shows his own sympathy with the Protestants. He has a lawyer's respect for ceremonial of all kinds, and his pages are often adorned and encumbered with the pageantry and material garniture of the story. The value of the Chronicle in its early stages is not great, but increases when dealing with the reign of Henry VII and is considerable for the reign of Henry VIII. To the historian it furnishes what is evidently the testimony of an eyewitness on several matters of importance which are neglected by other narrators, and to the student of literature it is of interest as one of the prime sources of Shakespeare's history plays. On 22 June 1940, Alan Keen, a dealer in antiquarian books, discovered an extensively annotated copy of Hall's Chronicle among the contents of a library from outside London which he had just purchased. Keen considered that the marginal annotations, most of which are found in the chapters covering the reigns of Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI, were made by Shakespeare. Keen published his findings in two journal articles,, and in a book co-authored with Alan Lubbock in 1954, The Annotator. After his death Keen left the volume in the hands of trustees, who placed it in the British Library, where until 2007 it was catalogued as Loan MS 61.E-mail from Manuscripts Department, British Library, 31 May 2013.

The play was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. It is thought to have been written between 1613 and 1616;Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Popular School: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1975; p. 69. it was not printed in its own era, and existed only in manuscript until it was published by Isaac Reed in 1778. The manuscript The still-extant manuscript (since 1821, MS. Malone 12 in the collection of the Bodleian Library), a small quarto-sized bundle of 48 leaves, is in the hand of Ralph Crane,W. W. Greg, \\"Some Notes on Crane's manuscript of The Witch,\\" The Library, 4th series, Vol. 22 (1942), pp. 208‚Äì22. the professional scribe who worked for the King's Men in this era, and who prepared several texts for the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, as well as two of the surviving manuscripts of Middleton's A Game at Chess, plus other King's Men's works. Since Middleton wrote for the King's Men in this period, the Crane connection is unsurprising. The manuscript bears Middleton's dedication to Thomas Holmes, Esq. There, Middleton refers to the play as \\"ignorantly ill-fated.\\" This was long taken to mean that the play failed with the audience, but modern critics allow the possibility that the play was pulled from performance for censorship or legal reasons.Nicholas Brooke, ed., Macbeth, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1990; p. 64. A 21st century adaptation is available.https://archive.org/details/TheBloodyBanquetbewitchedByThemToDeathAdaptationsOf17thCentury Macbeth Robert Johnson as it appears in Drexel 4175 Two songs, \\"Come away, come away\\" and \\"Black spirits\\", occur in both The Witch and Shakespeare's Macbeth.G. Blakemore Evans, textual editor, The Riverside Shakespeare, Boston, Houghton and Mifflin, 1974; pp. 1340‚Äì1. Middleton's play gives the full lyrics, whereas Macbeth only mentions the song titles in stage cues. Many scholars agree that the songs were interpolated into Macbeth during the printing of the First Folio. Witches Middleton's primary source for material on witches was the Discovery of Witchcraft of Reginald Scot (1584),Logan and Smith, p. 66. from which the playwright drew invocations, demons' names, and potion ingredients. Middleton, however, ignores Scot's sceptical attitude toward much witchcraft lore, and merely mines his book for exploitable elements. He also borrowed the situation of a historical Duke and Duchess of Ravenna, related in the Florentine History of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli and in the fiction of Matteo Bandello. Witchcraft was a topical subject in the era Middleton wrote, and was the subject of other works like The Witch of Edmonton and The Late Lancashire Witches. Middleton's chief witch is a 120-year-old practitioner called Hecate. Her magic adheres to the Classical standard of Seneca's Medea; she specialises in love and sex magic, giving one character a charm to cause impotence. (In forming this aspect of the play's plot, Middleton may have been influenced by the contemporaneous real-life divorce scandal of Lady Frances Howard and the Earl of Essex, which involved charges of magic-induced impotence.)A. A. Bromham, \\"The Date of The Witch and the Essex Divorce Case.\\" Notes and Queries Vol. 225 (1980), pp. 149‚Äì52. Middleton's Hecate has a son (and incestuous lover) called Firestone, who serves as the play's clown. She leads a coven of four other witches, Stadlin, Hoppo, Hellwain, and Puckle. The occult material in The Witch occurs in only three scenes: * Act I, scene ii introduces the coven and contains abundant witchcraft exotica, to establish the macabre mood ‚Äî fried rats and pickled spiders, the flesh of an \\"unbaptized brat,\\" a cauldron boiling over a blue flame, \\"Urchins, elves, hags, satyrs, Pans, fawns...Tritons, centaurs, dwarfs, imps...\\", \\"the blood of a flittermouse [bat],\\" and much much more. At one point, a cat enters playing a fiddle (a role probably filled by a musician in feline costume). * III,iii features the song \\"Come away\\" that was added to Macbeth, and deals with the witches' flight through the air: at one point \\"A Spirit descends in the shape of a Cat,\\" and Hecate is shown \\"Ascending with the Spirit.\\" * V,ii contains the song \\"Black spirits,\\" also inserted into Macbeth. Middleton's witches \\"are lecherous, murderous and perverse in the traditional demonological way, but they are also funny, vulnerable and uncomfortably necessary to the maintenance of state power and social position by those who resort to them.\\"Marion Gibson, Witchcraft and Society in England and America, 1550‚Äì1750, Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 2003; p. 97. Middleton's choice to set the play in Italy may reflect an element of satire against witchcraft beliefs and practices in Roman Catholic societies of his era.Gibson, p. 98.

His fiancee Isabella has just married the powerful aristocrat Antonio. According to the Renaissance custom of handfast, Sebastian regards Isabella as his wife in the sight of Heaven. Sebastian is distraught at the thought of Isabella consummating her marriage with Antonio that night. Antonio's courtesan Florida enters, upset that Antonio has married another woman. Antonio's servant Gaspero assures her that Antonio will return to her after he has grown tired of his new wife. Almachildes, \\"a fantastical gentleman,\\" enters and flirts with Amoretta, a lady-in-waiting, but she resists. Almachildes decides to go to \\"the witches\\" to procure a charm to make Amoretta fall in love with him. The wedding party, including the Duke, the Duchess, Antonio, and Isabella enter. The Duke has a goblet made from the skull of his wife's father (a defeated enemy) and uses it to make toasts. The Duchess is disgusted, but conceals her disdain. In an aside, she says that she has already decided upon her revenge. Scene 2: Hecate's cave Hecate, the chief witch, enters carrying serpents and an \\"unbaptized brat.\\" The witches plan to boil the baby and use its fat to make a transvection ointment that enables them to fly at night, transform themselves into incubi, and have sex with young men. Sebastian enters and asks Hecate to make Antonio impotent. Hecate gives him a charm made from the skins of lizards and snakes. Sebastian leaves. Almachildes enters, very drunk. He gives Hecate a toad and asks her for a love charm for Amoretta. She obliges, giving him a charm that will make Amoretta instantly fall in love with him, provided it is touching her body. Pleased with the toad, Hecate invites Almachildes to dinner. A cat playing a fiddle (Malkin) enters, followed by spirits bearing plates of fine meat. Act II Scene 1: Antonio's house; the morning after the wedding Antonio is extremely glum because Hecate's charm made him impotent on his wedding night. Francisca (Antonio's younger sister) enters. Left alone on stage, she reveals that she has been receiving secret nighttime visits from Aberzanes, and is now heavily pregnant. She worries that Antonio will kill her if the pregnancy is discovered. Isabella enters, not knowing of the pregnancy, and encourages Francisca to get married so she can discuss matters of a marital nature with her (Antonio's impotency is obviously on her mind). Antonio enters and Isabella sings a song for him; the lyrics of the song slyly allude to the plights of Isabella, Amoretta and Francisca. Aberzanes (\\"a gentleman, neither honest, wise nor valiant\\") enters. Francisca takes him aside and asks what they should do about her pregnancy. Aberzanes assures her that he has a plan. Sebastian enters disguised as a servant, \\"Celio.\\" Isabella introduces \\"Celio\\" (not knowing he is actually Sebastian) and says that she has just hired him that very morning. \\"Celio\\" announces the arrival of a letter from Antonio's mother in Northern Italy, asking Francisca to come immediately. (The letter is in fact a forgery by Aberzanes; this is his way of getting Francisca out of the house so she can give birth in secret.) Antonio orders Francisca to go to Northern Italy at once. Left alone on stage, Sebastian deduces from Antonio's glum demeanor that Hecate's charm worked. He is pleased, but even more desperate than before to get Isabella back. At the end of the scene, Gaspero enters with the Lord Governor (Isabella's uncle), who has come to pay Antonio a visit. Scene 2: The Duke's palace Almachildes regretfully recalls his drunken dinner with the witches. He discovers Hecate's charm in his pocket and decides to try it out. Amoretta enters. Almachildes embraces her and slips the charm into the bodice of her dress. Amoretta pushes Almachildes away; he exits. Then the charm begins to work: Amoretta has a sudden change of heart and declares that Almachildes is \\"the sweetest gentleman in court.\\" She also reveals that the Duchess has ordered her to get close to Almachildes so he can be used in an undisclosed \\"employment.\\" Amoretta says she was initially averse to this, but she now looks forward to the task with great relish. The Duchess enters and asks Amoretta if she has arranged with Almachildes yet. Amoretta says that she could never do anything to deceive Almachildes, but declares her willingness to become his honest wife. The Duchess wonders if Amoretta has lost her mind. The charm falls from Amoretta's dress to the floor, and the Duchess (whose name, conveniently, is also Amoretta) picks it up, thereby transferring the love spell from Amoretta to the Duchess. Amoretta immediately declares her complete hatred for Almachildes; the Duchess declares her love for him. Amoretta agrees to deceive Almachildes. The Duchess looks forward to tasting the sweetness of revenge and love combined; she exits. Almachildes enters. Amoretta flirts with him and promises to meet him soon. Almachildes assumes that Hecate's charm has done its trick. Scene 3: A farmhouse Francisca has had her baby. Aberzanes pays an old woman for her help delivering the baby, then leaves it on the doorstep of his friend, a tailor, after giving a speech about how the tailor once suggested doing exactly that. Aberzanes and Francisca prepare to return to Urbino. Francisca examines her reflection in a mirror. She is surprised to see how pale and thin she has grown. Act III Scene 1: The Duke's palace The Duchess has tricked Almachildes into having sex with her by blindfolding him and pretending to be Amoretta. The scene begins as she removes the blindfold. She tells Almachildes that she will marry him if he helps her kill the Duke, but threatens to accuse him of rape if he refuses. Almachildes agrees to help her kill the Duke. Scene 2: The grounds of Antonio's house Gaspero helps Florida sneak into the house for a rendezvous with Antonio. Sebastian (disguised as \\"Celio\\") sees Florida heading off to Antonio's bedroom. Gaspero tells \\"Celio\\" that Florida is Antonio's mistress, and that she has visited the house three times in the past ten days (it seems that Hecate's impotency charm only impedes Antonio's ability to have sex with Isabella). Alone onstage, Isabella says she has found a letter that reveals the details of Francisca's affair with Aberzanes. Aberzanes and Francisca enter, supposedly having just returned from Northern Italy. Isabella confronts Francisca with the letter and insists that she leave Antonio's house immediately. In a soliloquy, Francisca decides to protect herself against exposure by spreading lies about Isabella. Francisca tells Antonio that Isabella has been having an affair with Gaspero. Antonio believes her, and decides to try to catch Isabella in the act of cheating on him. \\"Celio\\" tells Isabella about Antonio's relationship with Florida. Isabella, who has become dissatisfied with her impotent husband, promises to reward \\"Celio\\" handsomely if he can prove that his allegations against Antonio are true. \\"Celio\\" says that he can sneak Isabella out of the house and they will catch Antonio cheating on her. Scene 3: A forest glade Hecate, Hoppo and Stadlin prepare for a nighttime flight. Hoppo and Stadlin take off. Voices from offstage bid Hecate to hurry up and join the nighttime flight, and sing the song \\"Come Away, Come Away\\" (which also appears in Macbeth). A \\"Spirit like a cat\\" (Malkin) descends as the voices sing. Hecate ascends with the Cat, extolling the expected pleasures of her nighttime ride. Act IV Scene 1: The Duke's palace In a soliloquy, Almachildes reveals that he has helped the Duchess kill the Duke; but the Duchess's rule is unpopular and an uprising has broken out. Almachildes regrets his role in the Duke's murder and worries that he will become the Duchess' next victim. The Duchess enters and tells Almachildes that she is afraid for his safety. She advises him to lie low for a while and promises to marry him as soon as public sentiment cools down. Almachildes agrees to follow the Duchess' advice, but is privately skeptical of her intentions. In a short soliloquy, the Duchess says she plans to kill Almachildes so that he will not reveal her complicity in the Duke's murder. The Lord Governor enters. The Duchess promises him her love if he will intervene to calm the insurrection. The Lord Governor agrees. Scene 2: Fernando's house Sebastian tells Florida and Fernando about his convoluted scheme to lure Isabella into bed and deflower her. Posing as \\"Celio,\\" Sebastian has told Isabella to go to Fernando's house (a sort-of brothel where Florida has a room) and pose as Florida in an attempt to attain proof of Antonio's adultery. Then, Sebastian will pose as Antonio, go to Florida's room, and have sex with Isabella. Meanwhile, Florida will be at Antonio's house, having sex with him there. Fernando and Florida agree to Sebastian's plan. Florida leaves to go to Antonio's. Isabella knocks at the door of Fernando's house. Sebastian exits to an adjoining room. Fernando agrees to show Isabella to Florida's room. Isabella curses Antonio and says she would have never found herself in such a miserable situation if her first husband (Sebastian) had lived. Isabella and Fernando exit. Sebastian enters. Moved by Isabella's remembrance of him, he decides that it would be wrong to deceive her. Isabella enters and accuses \\"Celio\\" of deceiving her because Antonio was not in Florida's bedroom. \\"Celio\\" encourages Isabella to wait; he is reluctant to send her back home for fear she will discover Florida in her bed. Scene 3: Antonio's house Francisca expects Antonio to arrive home shortly, and is scheming to have him catch Gaspero and Isabella in bed together. Francisca calls for Gaspero, who enters undressed. Francisca says that Isabella has been calling for help, but none of her ladies-in-waiting have gone to her aid (Francisca drugged all of the ladies to make sure they would stay asleep). She urges Gaspero to go to Isabella's room immediately. Gaspero says that he has to get dressed first but Francisca tells him not to bother. Gaspero goes to Isabella's room. Antonio arrives and Francisca encourages him to search Gaspero's room. Antonio complies, and finds the room empty. Convinced that Gaspero must be sleeping with Isabella, Antonio draws his sword and heads to Isabella's room. He returns with a bloody sword, claiming to have stabbed Gaspero and Isabella (not realizing that \\"Isabella\\" was really Florida). Raving, he shouts that he will kill Francisca too, because she was the person who brought him the news of Isabella's adultery and made him a murderer. Fearing for her life, Francisca admits that she made the entire story up to conceal the illegitimate child she had with Aberzanes. This revelation stuns Antonio and plunges him into an even deeper grief. He puts his sword down and sends a servant to fetch Aberzanes. Act V Scene 1: Antonio's house Aberzanes arrives at Antonio's house. Antonio urges him to draw his sword and fight, but Aberzanes refuses. Antonio forces Francisca and Aberzanes to kneel and perform a handfast (engagement) ceremony, ending by making them drink some poisoned wine. He also drinks the wine himself‚Äîa suicidal act that is not in fact suicidal because the servant, Hermio, disobeyed Antonio's orders and refrained from poisoning the wine. In a soliloquy, Antonio wonders if his ruined marriage might be retribution for spreading false reports of Sebastian's death so he could marry Isabella. A servant enters and reports that Gaspero and \\"Isabella\\" are merely wounded, not dead. Gaspero enters and tells Antonio that the woman in his room was Florida, not Isabella. Assuming that Isabella is out having sex with another man, Antonio prays that the poisoned wine will not take effect until he can find his wife and kill her. Hermio tells him that the wine wasn't actually poisoned. The Lord Governor enters. Antonio tells the Lord Governor that his niece Isabella is an \\"impudent adulteress.\\" The Lord Governor demands proof. Florida enters and says that Isabella is sleeping with her servant \\"Celio\\" at Fernando's house. Antonio rushes off to Fernando's house in a rage. Isabella and \\"Celio\\" return to the house. Hermio tells them that there has been a great deal of commotion as a result of Isabella's absence and that Antonio has gone to Fernando's house to find her. Isabella blames \\"Celio\\" for staining her reputation. Sebastian worries that his foolhardy scheme has caused Isabella's ruin. Scene 2: Hecate's cave, a cauldron set The Duchess goes to Hecate to procure poison for Almachildes. Hecate offers her a portrait of Almachildes that will kill him within a month. The Duchess rejects it because it would take too long. Hecate recites a charm in Latin (quoted from Ovid) and assures the Duchess that Almachildes will die that evening. The Duchess exits. Hecate orders Firestone to bring her various ingredients, including \\"three ounces of the red-haired girl I killed last midnight.\\" These ingredients are stirred together in a pot; Hecate sings a charm song and the other witches perform a dance for the moon. Scene 3: Antonio's house Isabella explains her absence to the Lord Governor. He scolds \\"Celio\\" for providing Isabella with false information and leading her into a compromising situation. Hermio enters and announces that Antonio fell through a trap door to his death while searching Fernando's house for Isabella. Florida faints; some servants carry her away. The Lord Governor continues to scold \\"Celio.\\" \\"Celio\\" removes his disguise to reveal that he is actually Sebastian. Isabella expresses joyous disbelief and the Lord Governor welcomes him happily. Gaspero admits that Antonio paid him to give false reports of Sebastian's death. The Duchess enters. The Lord Governor reveals the body of the Duke (it has presumably been concealed in a curtained-off space up to this point) and charges the Duchess with adultery and murder. The Duchess admits to the murder, but denies the adultery. The Lord Governor calls for Almachildes. Almachildes enters and confesses that he had sex with the Duchess while blindfolded. Amoretta enters and testifies that the woman Almachildes slept with while blindfolded was actually a hired prostitute, not the Duchess. The Duchess is thus cleared of the adultery charge, but the murder charge still stands. At that moment, to everyone's great surprise, the Duke sits up from his death bed, perfectly alive (it seems as though Almachildes was not cold-blooded enough to actually kill him). The Duchess is thus cleared of all charges. The Duke is in a very forgiving mood. He thanks Almachildes for sparing his life, pardons his wife's transgressions, and promises to refrain from drinking out of the skull goblet in the future.

The dyadic transformation (also known as the dyadic map, bit shift map, 2x mod 1 map, Bernoulli map, doubling map or sawtooth mapChaotic 1D maps, Evgeny DemidovWolf, A. \\"Quantifying Chaos with Lyapunov exponents,\\" in Chaos, edited by A. V. Holden, Princeton University Press, 1986.) is the mapping (i.e., recurrence relation) : T: [0, 1) \\\\to [0, 1)^\\\\infty : x \\\\mapsto (x_0, x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots) produced by the rule : x_0 = x : \\\\forall n \\\\ge 0, x_{n+1} = (2 x_n) \\\\bmod 1.Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory ‚Äì The Doubling Map , Corinna Ulcigrai, University of Bristol Equivalently, the dyadic transformation can also be defined as the iterated function map of the piecewise linear function : T(x)=\\\\begin{cases}2x & 0 \\\\le x < \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\2x-1 & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\le x < 1\\\\. \\\\end{cases} The name bit shift map arises because, if the value of an iterate is written in binary notation, the next iterate is obtained by shifting the binary point one bit to the right, and if the bit to the left of the new binary point is a \\"one\\", replacing it with a zero. The dyadic transformation provides an example of how a simple 1-dimensional map can give rise to chaos. This map readily generalizes to several others. An important one is the beta transformation, defined as T_\\\\beta (x)=\\\\beta x\\\\bmod 1. This map has been extensively studied by many authors. It was introduced by Alfr√©d R√©nyi in 1957, and an invariant measure for it was given by Alexander Gelfond in 1959 and again independently by Bill Parry in 1960. A.

Relation to the Bernoulli process The map T : [0,1) ‚Üí [0,1), x \\\\mapsto 2x \\\\bmod 1 preserves the Lebesgue measure. The map can be obtained as a homomorphism on the Bernoulli process. Let \\\\Omega={H,T}^\\\\mathbb{N} be the set of all semi-infinite strings of the letters H and T. These can be understood to be the flips of a coin, coming up heads or tails. Equivalently, one can write \\\\Omega={0,1}^\\\\mathbb{N} the space of all (semi-)infinite strings of binary bits. The word \\"infinite\\" is qualiified with \\"semi-\\", as one can also define a different space {0,1}^\\\\mathbb{Z} consisting of all doubley-infinite (double-ended) strings; this will lead to the Baker's map. The qualification \\"semi-\\" is dropped below. This space has a natural shift operation, given by :T(b_0, b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots) = (b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots) where b_0, b_1, \\\\cdots is an infinite string of binary digits. Given such a string, write :x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{b_n}{2^{n+1}}. The resulting x is a real number in the unit interval 0\\\\le x\\\\le 1. The shift T induces a homomorphism, also called T, on the unit interval. Since T(b_0, b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots) = (b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots), one can easily see that T(x)=2x\\\\bmod 1. For the doubly-infinite sequence of bits \\\\Omega=2^\\\\mathbb{Z}, the induced homomorphism is the Baker's map. The dyadic sequence is then just the sequence :x,\\\\, T(x),\\\\, T^2(x),\\\\, T^3(x), \\\\cdots That is, x_n=T^n(x) The Cantor set Note that the sum :y=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{b_n}{3^{n+1}} gives the Cantor function, as conventionally defined. This is one reason why the set {H,T}^\\\\mathbb{N} is sometimes called the Cantor set. Rate of information loss and sensitive dependence on initial conditions One hallmark of chaotic dynamics is the loss of information as simulation occurs. If we start with information on the first s bits of the initial iterate, then after m simulated iterations (m < s) we only have (s ‚àí m) bits of information remaining. Thus we lose information at the exponential rate of one bit per iteration. After s iterations, our simulation has reached the fixed point zero, regardless of the true iterate values; thus we have suffered a complete loss of information. This illustrates sensitive dependence on initial conditions‚Äîthe mapping from the truncated initial condition has deviated exponentially from the mapping from the true initial condition. And since our simulation has reached a fixed point, for almost all initial conditions it will not describe the dynamics in the qualitatively correct way as chaotic. Equivalent to the concept of information loss is the concept of information gain. In practice some real-world process may generate a sequence of values {xn} over time, but we may only be able to observe these values in truncated form. Suppose for example that x0 = 0.1001101, but we only observe the truncated value 0.1001 . Our prediction for x1 is 0.001 . If we wait until the real-world process has generated the true x1 value 0.001101, we will be able to observe the truncated value 0.0011, which is more accurate than our predicted value 0.001. So we have received an information gain of one bit. Relation to tent map and logistic map The dyadic transformation is topologically semi-conjugate to the unit-height tent map. Recall that the unit-height tent map is given by : x_{n+1}=f_1(x_n)=\\\\begin{cases} x_n & \\\\mathrm{for}~~ x_n < 1/2 \\\\ (1-x_n) & \\\\mathrm{for}~~ 1/2 \\\\le x_n \\\\end{cases} The conjugacy is explicitly given by :S(x)=\\\\sin \\\\pi x so that :f_1 = S^{-1} \\\\circ T \\\\circ S That is, f_1(x) = S^{-1}(T(S(x))). This is stable under iteration, as :f_1^n = f_1\\\\circ\\\\cdots\\\\circ f_1 = S^{-1} \\\\circ T \\\\circ S \\\\circ S^{-1} \\\\circ \\\\cdots \\\\circ T \\\\circ S = S^{-1} \\\\circ T^n \\\\circ S It is also conjugate to the chaotic r = 4 case of the logistic map. The r = 4 case of the logistic map is z_{n+1}=4z_n(1-z_n); this is related to the bit shift map in variable x by :z_n =\\\\sin^2 (2 \\\\pi x_n). There is also a semi-conjugacy between the dyadic transformation (here named angle doubling map) and the quadratic polynomial. Here, the map doubles angles measured in turns. That is, the map is given by :\\\\theta\\\\mapsto 2\\\\theta\\\\bmod 2\\\\pi. Periodicity and non-periodicity Because of the simple nature of the dynamics when the iterates are viewed in binary notation, it is easy to categorize the dynamics based on the initial condition: If the initial condition is irrational (as almost all points in the unit interval are), then the dynamics are non-periodic‚Äîthis follows directly from the definition of an irrational number as one with a non-repeating binary expansion. This is the chaotic case. If x0 is rational the image of x0 contains a finite number of distinct values within [0, 1) and the forward orbit of x0 is eventually periodic, with period equal to the period of the binary expansion of x0. Specifically, if the initial condition is a rational number with a finite binary expansion of k bits, then after k iterations the iterates reach the fixed point 0; if the initial condition is a rational number with a k-bit transient (k ‚â• 0) followed by a q-bit sequence (q > 1) that repeats itself infinitely, then after k iterations the iterates reach a cycle of length q. Thus cycles of all lengths are possible. For example, the forward orbit of 11/24 is: : \\\\frac{11}{24} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{11}{12} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\mapsto \\\\cdots, which has reached a cycle of period 2. Within any sub-interval of [0,1), no matter how small, there are therefore an infinite number of points whose orbits are eventually periodic, and an infinite number of points whose orbits are never periodic. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions is a characteristic of chaotic maps. Periodicity via bit shifts The periodic and non-periodic orbits can be more easily understood not by working with the map T(x)=2x\\\\bmod 1 directly, but rather with the bit shift map T(b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots)=b_1, b_2,\\\\cdots defined on the Cantor space \\\\Omega={0,1}^\\\\mathbb{N}. That is, the homomorphism :x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{b_n}{2^{n+1}} is basically a statement that the Cantor set can be mapped into the reals. It is a surjection: every dyadic rational has not one, but two distinct representations in the Cantor set. For example, :0.1000000\\\\cdots = 0.011111\\\\cdots This is just the binary- string version of the famous 0.999...=1 problem. The doubled representations hold in general: for any given finite-length initial sequence b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots, b_{k-1} of length k, one has :b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots, b_{k-1},1,0,0,0,\\\\cdots = b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots, b_{k-1}, 0,1,1,1,\\\\cdots The initial sequence b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots, b_{k-1} corresponds to the non-periodic part of the orbit, after which iteration settles down to all zeros (equivalently, all-ones). Expressed as bit strings, the periodic orbits of the map can be seen to the rationals. That is, after an initial \\"chaotic\\" sequence of b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots, b_{k-1}, a periodic orbit settles down into a repeating string b_k,b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\\\\cdots, b_{k+m-1} of length m. It is not hard to see that such repeating sequences correspond to rational numbers. Writing :y=\\\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} b_{k+j}2^{-j-1} one then clearly has :\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty b_{k+j}2^{-j-1} = y\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty 2^{-jm} = \\\\frac{y}{1-2^m} Tacking on the initial non-repeating sequence, one clearly has a rational number. In fact, every rational number can be expressed in this way: an initial \\"random\\" sequence, followed by a cycling repeat. That is, the periodic orbits of the map are in one-to-one correspondence with the rationals. This phenomenon is note-worthy, because something similar happens in many chaotic systems. For example, geodesics on compact manifolds can have periodic orbits that behave in this way. Keep in mind, however, that the rationals are a set of measure zero in the reals. Almost all orbits are not periodic! The aperiodic orbits correspond to the irrational numbers. This property also holds true in a more general setting. An open question is to what degree the behavior of the periodic orbits constrain the behavior of the system as a whole. Phenomena such as Arnold diffusion suggest that the general answer is \\"not very much\\". Density formulation Instead of looking at the orbits of individual points under the action of the map, it is equally worthwhile to explore how the map affects densities on the unit interval. That is, imagine sprinkling some dust on the unit interval; it is denser in some places than in others. What happens to this density as one iterates? Write \\\\rho:[0,1]\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} as this density, so that x\\\\mapsto\\\\rho(x). To obtain the action of T on this density, one needs to find all points y=T^{-1}(x) and write Dean J. Driebe, Fully Chaotic Maps and Broken Time Symmetry, (1999) Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht Netherlands :\\\\rho(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{y=T^{-1}(x)} \\\\frac{\\\\rho(y)}{T^\\\\prime(y)} The denominator in the above is the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, here it is just the derivative of T and so T^\\\\prime(y)=2. Also, there are obviously only two points in the preimage of T^{-1}(x), these are y=x/2 and y=(x+1)/2. Putting it all together, one gets :\\\\rho(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+1}{2}\\\\right) By convention, such maps are denoted by \\\\mathcal{L} so that in this case, write :\\\\left[\\\\mathcal {L}_T\\\\rho\\\\right](x) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+1}{2}\\\\right) The map \\\\mathcal{L}_T is a linear operator, as (obviously) one has \\\\mathcal{L}_T(f+g)= \\\\mathcal{L}_T(f) + \\\\mathcal{L}_T(g) and \\\\mathcal{L}_T(af)= a\\\\mathcal{L}_T(f) for all functions f,g on the unit interval, and all constants a. Viewed as a linear operator, the most obvious and pressing question is: what is it's spectrum? One eigenvalue is obvious: given \\\\rho(x)=1, one obviously has \\\\mathcal{L}_T\\\\rho=\\\\rho so the uniform density is invariant under the transformation. This is in fact the largest eigenvalue of the operator \\\\mathcal{L}_T, it is the Frobenius‚ÄìPerron eigenvalue. The uniform density is, in fact, nothing other than the invariant measure of the dyadic transformation. To explore the spectrum of \\\\mathcal{L}_T in greter detail, one must first limit oneself to a suitable space of functions (on the unit interval) to work with. This might be the space of Lesbegue measureable functions, or perhaps the space of square integrable functions, or perhaps even just polynomials. Working with any of these spaces is surprisingly difficult, although a spectrum can be obtained. Borel space A vast amount of simplification results if one instead works with the Cantor space \\\\Omega={0,1}^\\\\mathbb{N}, and functions \\\\rho:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. Some caution is advised, as the map T(x)=2x\\\\bmod 1 is defined on the unit interval of the real number line, assuming the natural topology on the reals. By contrast, the map T(b_0,b_1,b_2,\\\\cdots)=b_1, b_2,\\\\cdots is defined on the Cantor space \\\\Omega={0,1}^\\\\mathbb{N}, which, by convention is given a very different topology, the product topology. There is a potential clash of topologies; some care must be taken. However, as presented above, there is a homorphism from the Cantor set into the reals; fortunately, it maps open sets into open sets, and thus preserves notions of continuity. To work with the Cantor set \\\\Omega={0,1}^\\\\mathbb{N}, one must provide a topology for it; by convention, this is the product topology. By adjoining set-complements, it can be extended to a Borel space, that is, a sigma algebra. The topology is that of cylinder sets. A cylinder set has the generic form :(*,*,*,\\\\cdots,*,b_k,b_{k+1},*,\\\\cdots, *,b_m,*,\\\\cdots) where the * are \\"don't care\\" bit values, and the b_k, b_m, \\\\cdots are a finite number of explicitly specific bit-values scattered in the infinite don't-care bit-string. These are the open sets of the topology. The canonical measure measure on this space is the Bernoulli measure for the fair coin-toss. If there is just one bit specified in the string of don't-care positions, the measure is 1/2. If there are two bits specified, the measure is 1/4, and so on. One can get fancier: given a real number 0 one can define a measure :\\\\mu_p( *,\\\\cdots,*,b_k,*,\\\\cdots) = p^n(1-p)^m if there are n heads and m tails in the sequence. The measure with p=1/2 is preferred, since it is preserved by the map :b_0, b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots \\\\mapsto x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{b_n}{2^{n+1}}. So, for example, (0,*,\\\\cdots) maps to the interval [0,1/2] and (1,*,\\\\cdots) maps to the interval [1/2,1] and both of these intervals have a measure of 1/2. Similarly, (*,0,*,\\\\cdots) maps to the interval [0,1/4]\\\\cup[1/2,3/4] which still has the measure 1/2. That is, the embedding above preserves the measure. An alternative is to write :b_0, b_1, b_2, \\\\cdots \\\\mapsto x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left[b_n p^{n+1} + (1-b_n)(1-p)^{n+1}\\\\right] which preserves the measure \\\\mu_p. That is, it maps such that the measure on the unit interval is again the Lesbesgue measure. Frobenius‚ÄìPerron operator Denote the collection of all open sets on the Cantor set by \\\\mathcal{B} and consider the set \\\\mathcal{F} of all arbitrary functions f:\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. The shift T induces a pushforward :f\\\\circ T^{-1} defined by \\\\left(f\\\\circ T^{-1}\\\\right)(x) = f(T^{-1}(x)). This is again some function \\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. In this way, the map T induces another map \\\\mathcal{L}_T on the space of all functions \\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. That is, given some f:\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, one defines :\\\\mathcal{L}_T f = f \\\\circ T^{-1} This linear operator is called the transfer operator or the Ruelle‚ÄìFrobenius‚ÄìPerron operator. The largest eigenvalue is the Frobenius‚ÄìPerron eigenvalue, and in this case, it is 1. The associated eigenvector is the invariant measure: in this case, it is the Bernoulli measure. Again, \\\\mathcal{L}_T(\\\\rho)= \\\\rho when \\\\rho(x)=1. Spectrum To obtain the spectrum of \\\\mathcal{L}_T, one must provide a suitable set of basis functions for the space \\\\mathcal{F}. One such choice is to restrict \\\\mathcal{F} to the set of all polynomials. In this case, the operator has a discrete spectrum, and the eigenfunctions are (curiously) the Bernoulli polynomials!Pierre Gaspard, \\"r-adic one-dimensional maps and the Euler summation formula\\", Journal of Physics A, 25 (letter) L483-L485 (1992). (This coincidence of naming was presumably not known to Bernoulli.) Indeed, one can easily verify that :\\\\mathcal{L}_T B_n= 2^{-n}B_n where the B_n are the Bernoulli polynomials. This follows because the Bernoulli polynomials obey the identity :\\\\frac{1}{2}B_n\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{2}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{1}{2}B_n\\\\left(\\\\frac{y+1}{2}\\\\right) = 2^{-n}B_n(y) Note that B_0(x)=1. Another basis is provided by the Haar basis, and the functions spanning the space are the Haar wavelets. In this case, one finds a continuous spectrum, consisting of the unit disk on the complex plane. Given z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} in the unit disk, so that z<1, the functions :\\\\psi_{z,k}(x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty z^n \\\\exp i\\\\pi(2k+1)2^nx obey :\\\\mathcal{L}_T \\\\psi_{z,k}= z\\\\psi_{z,k} for integer k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}. This is a complete basis, in that every integer can be written in the form (2k+1)2^n. The Bernoulli polynomials are recovered by setting k=0 and z=\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{4},\\\\cdots A complete basis can be given in other ways, as well; they may be written in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function. Another complete basis is provided by the Takagi function. This is a fractal, differentiable-nowhere function. The eigenfunctions are explicitly of the form :\\\\mbox{blanc}_{w,k}(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty w^n s((2k+1)2^{n}x) where where s(x) is the triangle wave. One has, again, :\\\\mathcal{L}_T \\\\mbox{blanc}_{w,k}= w\\\\;\\\\mbox{blanc}_{w,k} All of these different bases can be expressed as linear combinations of one- another. In this sense, they are equivalent. The fractal eigenfunctions show an explicit symmetry under the fractal groupoid of the modular group; this is developed in greater detail in the article on the Takagi function (the blancmange curve). Perhaps not a surprise; the Cantor set has exactly the same set of symmetries (as do the continued fractions.) This then leads elegantly into the theory of elliptic equations and modular forms.

It was not intended to reconnoitre and report as its name suggests but was a light armoured combat vehicle, mostly without a radio and used as a support tank for the mechanised infantry. The AMR 35 originated from a project in 1933 to improve the earlier AMR 33 by moving the engine from the front to the back. In 1934 also a stronger suspension was fitted and the type was chosen to replace the AMR 33 on the production lines that year. Three orders were made by the French Cavalry of in total two hundred vehicles in five versions, including two machine-gun tanks, two tank destroyer types and a command tank. Later ten were ordered of a radio communication variant, the Renault YS, and over forty were built of a tropical version, the ZT 4. The production would be much delayed by financial and technical problems, deliveries only starting in 1936. The AMR 35 proved to be an unreliable vehicle. It was one of the fastest tanks of its day, but its very speed overstressed its mechanical parts. In 1937 it was decided not to make any further orders but organisational difficulties slowed final deliveries of some versions until well into 1940; by the time of the Fall of France in June 1940 the ZT 4 order had even not been finished yet. During the Battle of France the AMR 35s were part of armoured and motorised divisions, the vast majority being lost during the first weeks of the fighting. During the remainder of the Second World War Germany made use of some captured vehicles. Development With his AMR 33 not yet being delivered to the French army ‚Äî this would happen in June 1934 ‚Äî Louis Renault used two of the five AMR 33 prototypes to improve the type. In the middle of February 1934 he sent the first, N¬∞ 79759, to the testing commission, after it had from September 1933Touzin (1976), p. 67 been lengthened and refitted with a much more powerful Nerva Stella 28 CV engine, which now was placed in the back, instead of the front, of the vehicle, both to reduce the effect of engine noise as to attain a better weight distribution, two problems that had become apparent in 1933 when the prototypes had been used for manoeuvres. The exhaust pipe was placed at the back and the ventilator moved from the right to the left side. Renault was hesitant to introduce such expensive improvements in the production run; but in February 1934 the head of the French Cavalry, General Flavigny, insisted on these changes being made. During testing the maximum speed was shown to be an impressive 72 km/h. Weight was just 4.68 metric tonnes (to which a 0.25 tonne simulation weight was added), the average road speed 40.5 km/h. However, some cavalry officers pointed out that the Renault Nerva Stella was a sports car and its engine rather delicate and thus unsuited to the rigours of military service. They proposed to use a more robust Renault city bus engine instead. In March the second prototype, N¬∞ 79760, was also lengthened twenty centimetres and fitted with a Renault 432 22 CV four-cylinder bus engine. This vehicle, with a weight of 5.03 tonnes and a simulation weight of 0.75 tonnes, was tested between 3 and 11 April at Vincennes and attained a maximum speed of 63.794 km/h and an average speed of 35.35 km/h.Touzin (1976), p. 68 A subsequent order of 92 for the second vehicle with its more reliable engine was made on 3 July 1934. This type, replacing the AMR 33 in the production run, was to have the name AMR 35. Of these, twelve should be of a platoon command type, fitted with the AVIS-1 turret with a 7,5 mm machine gun and equipped with an ER1 radio set. The remaining eighty vehicles would have a larger AVIS-2 turret with a 13.2 mm machine gun; 31 of the latter were also intended to be equipped with ER1 radio sets, though in 1937 it was decided to abandon this plan. Also eight radio command tanks were to be produced, which eventually would be called AMR 35 ADF 1, bringing the order to a total of hundred vehicles.Touzin (1979), p. 53 At this time however it became clear that the AMR 33 suspension system, that originally had been intended to be used on the AMR 35 also, was very unreliable: the suspension units were simply too weak to withstand the forces caused by driving cross-country. A complete redesign of the suspension was ordered, also to be used for the new Renault R35. Three types were considered and tested on AMR 33 prototype N¬∞ 79758; the first had the idler resting on the ground; the second two bogies and five road wheels, like the R 35. This Renault ZB was rejected, but in March 1936 twelve were ordered by China and four a few months later by the Yunnan province administration. The latter were delivered in October 1938, the former only in 1940.Ness (2002), p. 217 The third suspension type had only one bogie per side and was accepted. The Renault factory designation of the vehicle with the relocated engine and new suspension was Renault ZT; it merely indicates the chronological order of Renault's military prototypes and has no further meaning. The new suspension was first tested on a third prototype, in September 1934 newly built from boiler plate; its idler wheel was still of the AMR 33 suspension type and its turret was that of the second prototype. Description The production vehicles would differ slightly from the third prototype:Touzin (1976), p. 69 they had more riveted, instead of bolted, plates and used the Renault 447 engine. The AMR 35 is somewhat larger than the AMR 33, being 3.84 metres long, 1.76 metres wide and 1.88 metres tall. It weighs, fully loaded, 6.5 metric tonnes (six tonnes unloaded). The vertical armour plates have a thickness of thirteen millimetres, the sloped plates are nine millimetres thick and the top and bottom plates six millimetres. Its general configuration has been changed in that the engine was moved to the back. Originally it had been intended to give the driver a more central position to improve his view to the right but eventually he remained at the left side of the hull, the right side being occupied by a large ventilation grill. The turret, where the second crew member, the commander/gunner, is located, is also placed left of centre. Two types of turret are being used: the Mod√®le r√©glementaire AVIS-1 fitted with the 7,5 mm Mod√®le 1931 Type C machine-gun and an ammunition stock of 2250 rounds and the AVIS-2 with a 13,2 mm machine-gun. The 7.5 mm version also has a reserve machine-gun that can be placed on a small mount on top of the turret for AA use. If a radio is present it is the ER 29, operated by the commander. The suspension uses four much more robust road wheels. The two in the middle are paired into a central bogie, sprung by a horizontal rubber cylinder block, that again consists of five smaller rubber cylinders separated by steel discs. These cylinders also serve as shock dampers, avoiding the problems caused by the oil dampers used with the AMR 33. The wheels in the front and back are independently sprung, again by a rubber cylinder block, but now consisting of four smaller cylinders. The sprocket is in the front. The track is 22 centimetres wide and is supported by four top rollers. The wading capacity is sixty centimetres, the trench crossing-capacity 1,7 metres and a vertical obstacle of fifty centimetres or slope of 50% can be climbed.Touzin (1979), p. 55 The Renault 447 22 CV four- cylinder 5881 cc petrol engine renders, according to the official French Army manual, a maximum speed of 55 km/h, making it the fastest French tank of its day. Renault brochures claimed the higher speed of 60 km/h and many sources mention the latter number. It has a peak output of 82 hp at 2200 r/m. The average road speed is 40 km/h. The brakes are of the single dry plate type and a Cleveland differential is used. There are four forward gears and one in reverse. There is a Z√©nith carburettor and a Scintilla Vertex magneto, making it possible to start electrically even at temperatures below zero. A fuel tank of 130 litres renders a range of two hundred kilometres. Production The original order envisaged a first delivery of ten vehicles in December 1934 and a completion in March 1935. This last date was soon postponed to August 1935, but that month production had hardly started yet due to great financial problems with Renault. In June 1935 Renault even refused a second order of fifty, fearing the contractual fines the inevitable delays would cause. However, on 20 April 1936 he accepted an additional order for thirty vehicles, to be delivered before 15 December 1936. Of these, fifteen would be of the 7.5 mm machine-gun version, five of the ADF 1 and five each of two tank destroyer types, the ZT 2 and ZT 3. On 9 October 1936 a third and final contract was signed of seventy vehicles: sixty of the 7.5 mm machine-gun version, half of these without a radio set; and five each of the ZT 2 and ZT 3, with a final delivery before 7 August 1937. The onset of production was also slowed by coordination problems with the subcontractors: Schneider would produce the armour plates and construct empty hulls; Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon would make the AVIS-2 turrets. Final assembly was by Renault. In March 1935 Schneider delivered the first empty hull. On 20 May this hull was finished and sent to Satory for tests. When these had been successfully completed on 24 June, another vehicle, the third of the production series, was sent to the STC (Section Technique de Cavalerie) for further testing. The Satory vehicle was fitted with a turret and again tested between 3 and 7 August without serious problems. On 9 August however, the STC vehicle failed to climb a 50% slope, even though the other vehicle had done so effortlessly. This would be the beginning of a series of severe delays. The Army demanded that the gear ratio be changed and on 2 September refused to accept the first batch of twelve vehicles. On 19 October the first modified vehicle was finished and the first eleven vehicles were only accepted in January 1936 and the first AMR 35 taken into service on 22 April 1936. Meanwhile, the Citro√´n factory had tried to take over the order by developing the AMR Citro√´n P 103 which had a very novel hydraulic suspension, but this project was rejected. On 22 February 1936 thirty AMR 35s had been produced; twenty more were being worked on. By the end of June 1936 production numbers had reached 76 tanks, 41 of which had been delivered. At that moment however, a very serious reliability problem emerged that was to slow down production considerably. Many mechanical parts proved to be too weak; especially the Cleveland differentials were not capable of taking the stress loads caused by the high speed of the tank. Much of the factory capacity in 1937 was used to rebuild and modify the entire first production batch of 92. On 8 April 1937 Renault was forced to submit two modified vehicles ‚Äî one of each of the two main versions ‚Äî for acceptance as \\"prototypes\\". This upgrading project did not result in a very reliable vehicle though: in October the Ministry of War was amazed to find out that out of 43 vehicles, of which the differential had already been replaced five times, six were again in need of a new one. From August 1937 the 75 gun tanks of the second and third series were taken into production. The first five of these were only delivered between 3 and 5 May 1938, the next ten between 2 and 3 June. On 27 July 56 had been produced and 34 delivered. The penultimate delivery was on 21 November, the last vehicles were probably produced just before the end of 1938. The second and third batch incorporated the improvements made in 1937 on the first batch but also featured some unique modifications such as a Synchromesh gear box and reinforced chassis girders in the front of the vehicle to ensure a sufficient frame rigidity: a severe distortion had occurred on the earlier vehicles. The AMR 35 vehicles remained very unreliable: on 1 January 1939 only 129 chassis of all subtypes were present in the combat units,Jeudy (1997), p. 151 the others being centrally repaired or having been sent back to the factory. Due to the structural delays and technical problems it had been decided in 1937 to eventually discontinue AMR 35 production and to supplement the existing vehicles by a more reliable and powerfully armed new armoured car, the AMR Gendron-SOMUA. For Renault, the entire AMR project had been a financial disaster. On 16 November 1938 he begged the government to be exonerated from the contractual fines, pointing out that he had already, on his expense, twice completely replaced the gear wheels on all vehicles and additionally all transmissions and front axles. Variants and projects The three orders of 1935 and 1936 called for a production of two hundred vehicles: eighty-seven of the AVIS-1 version, eighty of the AVIS-2 version; thirteen of the ADF 1; ten of the ZT 2 and ten of the ZT 3. However, the total number of vehicles based on the AMR 35 chassis was higher: there would be ten Renault YSs built; the third AMR 35 prototype used the AMR 35 suspension and finally there would be a production of at least forty of the ZT 4, resulting in a grand total of 251 units directly belonging to the larger AMR 35 family. Also two YS prototypes were modified with the AMR 35 suspension and one of these was again rebuilt as the Renault YS 2 prototype, that is generally considered an AMR 35 variant. Apart from these, three AMR 33s were built with the new suspension, two AMR 33 prototypes were rebuilt with it and about half a dozen AMR 33's were likewise modified in 1940. Also the sixteen Renault ZB vehicles could be considered as belonging to an AMR 35 variant. Heavier armament As the 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun was only effective against the lightest armour at a very short distance because its AP-bullet could just penetrate eight millimetres of armour at fifty metres, several efforts were made to provide some more serious antitank- capacity to AMR units. The first was to uparm the main production run vehicles with a heavier machine-gun. The second was to fit the vehicles with the 25 mm antitank-gun; to this effect both a tank (the ZT 2) and a self-propelled gun (the ZT 3), were developed. The 25 mm gun vehicles were primarily intended for the reconnaissance units, the Groupes de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, of the motorised infantry divisions; these were part of the Infantry, but the Cavalry provided the reconnaissance elements. On 22 July 1936 it was decided to assign four of such 25 mm vehicles to each GRDI. The decision to design two types, despite the very small production batches, was motivated by the desire to let them operate in pairs; the low inconspicuous self-propelled gun would directly ambush enemy vehicles and the higher tank, fitted with a radio set, would be more behind in an oversight position, also with its rotatable turret covering the flanks. However, the Cavalry at first also intended to eventually acquire the ZT 2 for the other AMR units; the general failure of the AMR 35 project ended these plans. =AMR 35 √† mitrailleuse 13,2= The heavy machine-gun vehicle featured the Mod√®le r√©glementaire AVIS-2 turret fitted with a Hotchkiss 13,2 mm Mod√®le 1930 mitrailleuse, which could penetrate 20 mm steel at 500 metres. To accommodate the larger machine-gun, the turret was made higher, more so at the left where the commander/gunner was seated and from which side the gun was fed ‚Äî normally this was done vertically, but to reduce height the gun had been rotated to the left ‚Äî giving it an asymmetrical and skewed appearance. This heavier type was produced parallel to the 7.5 mm machine-gun vehicles of the first production batch in a number of eighty; it was originally seen as the normal combat version, four of which would be present in a platoon of five. Later however, production was discontinued: though in 1934 even many battle tanks had been so lightly armoured as to be vulnerable to 13.2 mm fire, such a weapon had already become obsolete for this role in 1936. The gun had an ammunition stock of 1220 rounds: 740 in 37 magazines of twenty and another 480 in cardboard boxes. =ZT 2= The Renault ZT 2 was a tank with a larger octagonal welded steel APX 5 turret equipped with a shortened 25 mm SARF gun, which had a penetration of forty millimetres at five hundred metres. Despite the name, which reflects that it had been designed by the Atelier de Puteaux forge, the one-man turret, with a weight of 650 kilogrammes, was fabricated by the Atelier de Rueil (ARL), an APX offshoot based at Rueil. It had also been intended to equip the AM 39 armoured car (the Gendron-SOMUA). and the colonial version of the Panhard 178, but apart from the ten ZT 2 vehicles was only fitted to five Panhards, so the planned production of at least 259 remained limited to fifteen. The plan to produce a ZT 2 was first conceived in June 1935. On 12 December 1935 Renault had been ordered to produce a ZT 2 prototype, on a chassis to be taken from the first order of a hundred, but this was annulled when the ZT 2 was made part of the second order in a number of five. On 27 October 1937 the Renault factory estimated that all ten ZT 2s could be produced simultaneous to the second order production run and on 14 January 1938 it was thought that ZT 2 production could be ended in June 1938. Perhaps this was indeed accomplished as regards the first series of five, N¬∞ 95860 - 95864. The last five, N¬∞ M 3031 - M 3035, would only be assembled in December 1938. This just pertained to the hulls: none of these had yet been fitted with a turret. A first wooden mock-up of one, had been delivered on 13 July 1938. Only at the end of 1939 enough funds were made available to produce the turrets and finish the tanks at Rueil, a process that probably extended well into 1940. The hull of the ZT 2 was largely identical to that of the \\"ZT 1\\". Apart from the 25 mm gun, having a stock of fifty rounds, the turret was fitted with a 7.5 mm machine gun, with 2250 rounds. The turret had both a large roof hatch and a smaller hatch in the back right facet. It had been intended to equip at least one ZT 2, in a ZT 2/ZT 3 platoon of four, with a radio set, but it is uncertain whether any was so modified. =ZT 3= The Renault ZT3 was a tank destroyer with the same 25 mm gun in a superstructure on the hull. The development of the ZT 3 took place parallel to that of the ZT 2: a first plan in June 1935, followed by a request to Renault to produce a prototype on 12 December 1935. However, given the absence of a turret there was no need to wait for its development: Renault was instructed to quickly construct a first vehicle by adding a boiler plate superstructure to the old third AMR 35 prototype, and then sent it to Rueil where a gun could be built in and a cast commander cupola fitted. APX indicated on 6 April 1936 ‚Äî the plan to build just a single prototype already having been discarded when the second order was placed ‚Äî that it desired to have five vehicles ready for the September manoeuvres of 1936. That was a very optimistic assessment, especially given the fact they themselves had not yet sent the superstructure blueprints to Renault. On 26 October Schneider announced that the five empty hulls could not be delivered before the end of April 1937 ‚Äî the blueprints had not yet been received. On 27 October 1937 ‚Äî the hulls at Schneider are nearing completion ‚Äî APX demanded that between 15 and 20 November a \\"prototype\\" (not the original one of 1935) would be provided for acceptance. On 26 April 1938 APX approved the hull but only informed Schneider of this on 5 May. Meanwhile, between April 1936 and July 1937 Renault and the French government had had a major disagreement over the question which company should be given the order to supply the cast cupola; eventually this would be Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon. Only on 13 June 1938 Renault assembled the first vehicle (from the first series N¬∞ 95865 - 95869), that then went to Rueil to be fitted with the gun. On 9 December it was finished and Renault could begin the manufacture of the last nine vehicles (including the series M 3036 - M 3040) of the two hundred Renault ZTs: the second hull was delivered by Schneider on 31 October. The deliveries will have extended into 1939; op 2 September 1939 all GRDIs had attained their organic ZT 3 strength. To create sufficient room with the ZT 3 the hull was raised somewhat; the roof plates on the sides and front sloped towards the apex of the vehicle where a cast rotatable cupola provided the commander some height to observe his surroundings, in what was otherwise a very low and sleek construction. The gun was placed to the right of the driver with to its left a co-axial 7.5 mm machine-gun. There was an ammunition stock of eighty shells and 1200 bullets. As the position of the normal air intake was now occupied by the gun, a large roof ventilation grille was present above the third crew member, the gunner/loader. The fighting compartment was very cramped. No radio was present. Radio communication vehiclesRenault ADF 1= While AMR platoon commanders used an AVIS-1 vehicle with an ER29 radio set ‚Äî in theory 57 were equipped with one, though in practice it was often absent ‚Äî squadron commanders were in need of a vehicle with two sets: one to communicate with the platoons, the second to contact higher command levels. On 15 June 1934 Renault was asked to design a single prototype, to be delivered before 1 February 1935. On 15 October 1934 a second was demanded and eventually in 1934 eight such vehicles were part of the first order, N¬∞ 87438 - 87445. The second order in 1936 included a further five vehicles, N¬∞ 95870 - 95874, bringing the total to thirteen. The type was to resemble the standard gun tank, to avoid making it conspicuous: command vehicles are a standard priority target of enemy fire. For that reason the enlarged radio compartment was in the form of a superstructure that looked like a rotatable turret ‚Äî having the general form of the AVIS-2 but without the asymmetry ‚Äî but in reality was fixed to the hull. In the front of the \\"turret\\" a small gun mantlet was present, that normally lacked any armament but in an emergency situation could be fitted with the portable FM 24-29 machine-gun that was part of the crew equipment. To make sufficient room for an added third crew member, the radio operator, the gear box was moved to the front of the vehicle. The project was accordingly originally called the ZT avec bo√Æte √† l'avant (\\"ZT with front gear box\\") but later received the Renault designation ADF 1, again a meaningless code: Renault had run out of two letter codes. The army, for security reasons, seems not to have used any special name, which led to a later confusion with the Renault YS. Due to a delay in the formulation of the exact specifications for the radio equipment, construction of the first vehicle only began on 14 June 1938. The first two vehicles were sent to Satory on 1 and 2 August 1938. After delivery the Army built in the radio sets; this process was finished for all ten vehicles in the Spring of 1939. The first vehicle used two ER29 sets; the others, conforming to a decision already made in 1936, used a combination of the ER29 and the ER26 ter; in the latter case the effort to remain inconspicuous was rather spoiled by a very prominent large horizontal radio antenna frame fitted on top of the \\"turret\\". =Renault YS= The Renault YS was a version with a large superstructure but without turret, serving as a higher command vehicle. The specifications for such a type had been issued on 9 January 1931: it was then named the Type M. Renault had built two prototypes of boiler plate, based on the AMR 33 chassis, in 1933. General Darius Bloch, head of the technical section of the supreme command, had formed a favourable opinion on these in September 1933 and during a session of the Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement in January 1934 had desired that a dozen be acquired. On 10 April 1934 the order was signed for ten voitures de reconnaissance tous terrain blind√©s, to be delivered before 31 December 1934, the uncommon term \\"all-terrain armoured reconnaissance vehicles\\" intending to obscure the fact that they were command vehicles. They had the factory designation Renault YS. The prototypes had already been rebuilt with the AMR 35 suspension: to avoid a future disappointment Renault explicitly established in the contract that due to the more robust and heavier AMR 35 chassis to be used, the series vehicles would have an inferior performance: the weight would increase from 3.5 to 4.3 tonnes and maximum speed would drop from 60 to 55 km/h; average road speed from 40 to 35 km/h. The ten vehicles, N¬∞ 84252 - 84261, were only delivered between 14 and 16 December 1937, after having been tested between 1 September and 22 November 1937 by the Commission de Vincennes. The delay of three years could not be entirely be blamed to Renault: the different Arms for which the YSs were intended each had special requirements for the combinations of (short and long range) radio sets to be built in. Some of the latter even yet had to be developed ‚Äî the first specifications were only issued in June 1935 ‚Äî and afterwards for each subtype a special interference suppression had to be applied and thoroughly tested. For these tests the original two prototypes were used. Of the ten, the Cavalry received four vehicles (reduced from an original planned allocation of six) using the so-called \\"Type C\\" equipment: a combination of the ER (√âmitteur-Recepteur)26 ter and the ER29. Two of these were assigned to the 2nd and 3rd GAM (Groupe de Automitrailleuses) each. The Infantry also received four. Two of these had the \\"Type G\\" equipment: a combination of the ER51 mod√®le 1935 and the R15 (the last a receiver set only). These so-called type chars vehicles, intended for tank units, were assigned to the 507e and 510e R√©giment de Chars de Combat. The two others used a \\"Type E\\" equipment with a combination of the ER 26 ter and the R15; these were assigned to mechanised infantry units, the 5e and 17e BCP (Bataillon de Chasseurs Port√©s). Two Type E-vehicles were also received by the Artillery Arm and assigned to the 1er and 42e R√©giment Artillerie. The versions differed externally in the type of antennae (frames) used. As a whole the type had a very different configuration from that of the AMR 35: in the raised front and superstructure the engine was placed in the front, the driver was seated to the right with the vehicle commander to his left; and behind was a large compartment for two radio operators with a high double hatch in the back. The Artillery used only a single operator in exchange for more supplies. The unloaded weight was considerably higher than predicted, at 5950 kilogrammes. Fully loaded, including about 0.8 tonnes of radio equipment, weight increased to about 7.5 tonnes, hundred kilogrammes higher than the acceptable suspension maximum indicated by Renault. Despite the fitting of a second fuel tank, the range decreased to 150 kilometres and the reliability of the type was low with much breakage of the road wheel axles. =Renault YS 2= The Renault YS 2 was an artillery observation vehicle with advanced telemetric optics, among which a rangefinder turret. On 20 July 1936 it was decided by the Artillery to acquire such a type, called the voiture blind√©e tous terrains d'observation d'artillerie. On 11 August Renault was contacted to build a full scale wooden mock-up of a vehicle capable of accommodating the ER26 ter and R14 radio set, a large number of telephone cable connections and on top an optical rangefinder turret with a base of 160 centimetres. The Renault tank design bureau estimated that such a mock-up could be created for the negligible sum of just 6500 French franc and thus on 21 September made the counteroffer to rebuild one of the YS prototypes for ‚Ç£ 195,000, apart from supplying the mock- up for ‚Ç£ 9500. However, the ministry of defence refused this offer, just ordering the mock-up on 12 October. However, on 5 November Jean Restany, head of the Renault design bureau, decided to rebuild the prototype anyway. On 26 January 1937 the rangefinder was received, but it proved, with a width of 160 centimetres, simply too wide for a chassis that itself was no wider than 170 centimetres, though an attempt was made to place it in a wooden dummy turret. On 2 April a commission of artillery officers visited Renault and these suggested to use the smaller standard rangefinder used by machine-gun units that had a base of 125 centimetres. This was built in a steel cupola, that also featured a central pair of binoculars and binocular diascopes at the sides and back, that could be protected by armoured shutters. On 22 June Renault offered to sell this vehicle for the discount price of ‚Ç£ 150,000 (mock-up included). On 31 July the Army agreed; the contract was signed on 7 October 1937. The vehicle, N¬∞ 58993, had already been sent on 8 August and was for field tests assigned to the 309e RATTT (R√©giment d'Artillerie de Tracteurs Tous Terrains). Though the Atelier de Rueil in the Spring of 1938 began to study the possibility of fitting an improved turret, no further YS 2s were ordered, despite a continued demand for such vehicles: the Renault YS 2 was considered rather mediocre. ZT 4 On 9 October 1936, 21 Renault ZT4s, a tropical version with improved cooling, were ordered for the colonial troops to replace their obsolete Renault FT 17's, that were not very suited for the r√¥le of long range surveillance, typical of colonial conditions. As these troops still used the Hotchkiss 8 mm machine gun as their standard weapon, they wanted six ZT4 vehicles with the same to be produced in France; it was decided in the motherland however that it would be cheaper to install the old colonial FT 17 machine-gun turrets on new hulls of the AMR 35, so the latter were to be produced only. Likewise twelve 37 mm FT 17 turrets could be placed; only three vehicle would thus have the more expensive AVIS-1 turret and this was only allowed in 1937. As the colonies refused this solution ‚Äî but gave Renault no indication of an alternative ‚Äî deliveries were to be strongly delayed. The first order, destined for Indo-China, N¬∞ 6693 - 66953, had to be delivered between April and 9 July 1937, but not a single vehicle had been built at that date. The same year a second order was made, again of three AVIS-1 vehicles, bringing the total to 24. In May 1938 Renault tested the fitting of a 37 mm FT 17 turret on an AMR 35 chassis but no series production materialised. However, he went into negotiations with Brazil about a \\"considerable\\" export of ZT 4s. In the Autumn of 1938 the colonies made a third order of 31 ZT 4s, all with the AVIS-1, bringing the total to 55. Though Renault now had sufficient production capacity, the standard AMR 35 order having been finished, the labour and financial problems with his factory, combined with a lack of funding by the government, prevented any ZT 4 manufacture to start. Only after the beginning of the Second World War, when more means were made available, slowly production started: three units were made in February 1940, nine in March, fifteen in April and thirteen in May. On the forty hulls produced, not a single turret had been fitted however. After the German invasion an emergency plan was considered to equip them with a 25 mm gun; in the end some were in June sent to the front armed only with a makeshift machine-gun mount and others remained at the factory. That month probably about another seven hulls were finished.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2007, \\"Notre Cavalerie M√©canique √† son Apog√©e le 10 Mai 1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, N¬∞ 75, p. 42 The ZT 4s differ from the \\"ZT 1\\" in having large ventilation grilles at the sides and by a changed back, without stowage box, with a different rear-light and a shortened exhaust pipe. Airborne tank In 1936 the French Army began planning to execute, in case of war with Germany, offensive airborne operations on the enemy flanks (Netherlands, Switzerland) or hinterland. As no serious artillery support could be given, it entertained the thought of providing fire support to the infantry by airborne tanks, to be landed on captured airfields. A note by the 1er Direction (the Section des Chars de Combat of the Direction de l'Infanterie), dated 18 May 1936, shows that Renault had already begun to study the technical feasibility of such a project. On 26 May 1936 the Renault research bureau offered a possible solution. It proposed to design a light airborne tank, based on the Renault ZT. To save weight several innovative technologies would be applied: the use of light alloys; replacing the original chassis and turret using riveted armour plates with a cast hull and welded dome-shaped turret; the use of sloped armour and finally the use of the turret configuration already in development for the Char G1, featuring a gun mount on the bottom of the tank, obviating the need to install a heavy gun mantlet. By these measures Renault hoped to limit weight to 5040 kilogrammes for a maximum armour of thirteen millimetres or 5400 kilogrammes if the Army desired the higher protection level of twenty millimetres. The height would be 180 centimetres. To make room for a 37 mm gun, the minimal calibre to provide HE fire support, the turret would have a cross-section of 136 centimetres. A hundred shells could be carried and three thousand rounds for the 7.5 mm machine-gun. The crew would be two. As France at the time had no cargo planes large enough that a tank might drive over a ramp into their cargo rooms, Renault proposed to replace part of the bottom of a Bloch MB.300 bomber with a platform on which the Char L√©ger transportable par avion could be placed; it would have to be lowered and hoisted by cables. No prototype was ever built Operational history A group of 13.2 mm-armed AMR 35s, belonging to 4e RDP, 1re DLM; the vehicle in front, N¬∞ 87347, is the second produced and shows the large rosettes typical of this unit from 1938 Tactical function Due to its name, the AMR 35 has typically been described as a reconnaissance or scout tankNess (2002), p. 81 but this is inexact and possibly misleading.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2007, \\"Notre Cavalerie M√©canique √† son Apog√©e le 10 Mai 1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, N¬∞ 75, p. 45 Specialised reconnaissance was carried out, not by an AMR but by an AMD (Automitrailleuse de D√©couverte). The only ZT vehicles that really functioned in the reconnaissance r√¥le are the ZT 2 and ZT 3 that were part of reconnaissance units, that would distance themselves from the main force in search of the enemy or of routes that were free of enemy presence. The other AMR 35s however, were to the contrary originally intended to be part of the main force and functioned as its, \\"first contact\\", direct security screen: this was at the time the meaning of reconnaissance in the French Cavalry doctrine. Even this task however, would later become secondary to what was to be the AMR's main function: to provide direct fire support to dismounted cavalry or mechanised infantry units; the armoured trucks used by the latter had not even a machine-gun armament. Prewar assignment When the AMR 35 was first introduced no sharp distinction was made between the AMR 33 and 35, but this was to change in 1937. In 1936 and 1937 two Cavalry armoured divisions were created, the Divisions L√©g√®res M√©caniques (\\"Mechanised Light Divisions\\", with \\"light\\" meaning \\"mobile\\"). Initially it was intended that each of these would be equipped with seven AMR squadrons: four of these in their organic armoured brigade, the Brigade de Combat (two in each of two RRCs, R√©giments de Reconnaissance et Combat) and three in their mechanised infantry regiment or RDP (R√©giment de Dragons Port√©s). As each squadron had a strength of twenty tanks: four platoons of five each, there was a need for 280 vehicles. There thus seemed a clear prospect of further AMR 35 orders and a necessity for a temporary use of certain number of AMR 33s ‚Äî indeed some were taken into service by the DLMs. Within the RRCs the AMR 35s would have to form a first shock front ahead of the SOMUA S35s, engaging likely enemy light tanks, such as the Panzerkampfwagen I. The use of so many light tanks in a combat r√¥le had been forced upon the Cavalry by a shortage of S 35s: the original procurement plans for the medium tank had been cut in half by budget limitations. However, already in 1936 it was decided to redirect the production of the Hotchkiss H35, an infantry light tank that had been rejected by the Infantry in favour of the Renault R35, towards the Cavalry that decided to use it instead of the AMR 35 in the RRCs, even though the H 35 was not very fast: its poor armour weighed very heavily against the AMR 35 as the French military in this period became increasingly convinced lightly armoured vehicles could not survive on the modern battlefield. The function of the AMR 35 was thus limited to that of direct infantry support; this was reflected by the later procurement of 7.5 mm machine-gun vehicles only. The total DML requirement was diminished to six squadrons, four of them active, or 120 tanks. Therefore, it was decided to relegate all AMR 33s to the older DCs (Divisions de Cavalerie) and even equip one of these, 1re DC, with two squadrons of the AMR 35, in its 1e GAM (Groupe d'Automitrailleuses). Apart from these however, all AMR 35s should be concentrated into the DLMs. Some had already found their way into other units: during the general revision of 1937 they would be reallocated. This involved twee exemplars taken from 6e GAM, four from 7e Chasseurs, two from 3e GAM, two from 9e Dragons and three from the 1re BLM (Brigade L√©g√®re M√©canique). From photographic evidence it is known that earlier other units had made a temporary use of some vehicles. Reorganisation Initially it was intended to reform the 1re DC into the 3e DLM; its AMR 35s would then automatically reach their proper destination ‚Äî within a DLM instead of a DC. However, plans were changed at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939: at mobilisation the reserve AMR squadron of the 1st DC was equipped with the Hotchkiss H35 and its stocked AMR 35s relegated to the other seven squadrons ‚Äî two reserve tanks for each ‚Äî and, in a number of six, to the general mat√©riel reserve. At the end of 1939 1e DC was changed into the 1re Division L√©g√®re de Cavalerie. Battle of France In the Battle of France 120 AMR 33's and 187 ZT's were available. The AMR 35s were used to equip three squadrons in the 1st and 2nd DLM, 66 tanks in each division; and one squadron of 22 in the 1st Cavalry Light Division, for a total organic strength of 152;Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2007, \\"Notre Cavalerie M√©canique √† son Apog√©e le 10 Mai 1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, N¬∞ 75, p. 43 each platoon of five typically had two 13.2 mm machine- gun vehicles and three 7.5 mm machine-gun vehicles. The GRDI (Groupes de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie) of the five DIM (Divisions d'Infanterie Motoris√©e), each had an antitank-platoon with two ZT2's and two ZT3s. Five AMR 35 were present in the driver school at Saumur; eight were in the general mat√©riel reserve. Of the ten Renault YSs, four were used by the Cavalry, four by the Infantry and two by the Artillery. The Renault YS 2 prototype, despite not being made of hardened steel, was deployed by the 71e RA, the artillery regiment of 2e DLM. During the battle the 13.2 mm machine- gun proved to be incapable of defeating even the German armoured cars at normal combat ranges, its bullets being deflected by their sloped armour. However most AMR's were lost due to mechanical trouble. All vehicles assigned on 10 May had been lost by the end of the month. In June, an ad hoc-unit was created, the 7e DLM and part of this was the 4e RAM (R√©giment de Automitrailleuses) that used some AMR 35s taken from the mat√©riel reserve.  German use  The Germans used some AMR 35s as the Panzersp√§hwagen ZT 702 (f); the Renault YSs were also taken into service. The ZT4s, being brand new, were partly fitted with the 8cm schwerer Granatwerfer 34/1 in an open superstructure to produce a self-propelled 81 mm mortar; some received the AVIS-1 turret. Most of these vehicles were used by the occupation forces in France. In May 1945 three ZT4s were discovered by the Soviet forces entering Prague; they had been captured by the Czech resistance and turned against their former owners.

He is the diminutive, blond-haired caveman husband of Betty Rubble and adoptive father of Bamm-Bamm Rubble. His best friend is his next door neighbor, Fred. Barney's personality was based on that of Ed Norton on the 1950s television series The Honeymooners, played by Art Carney. Like Ralph Kramden on The Honeymooners, Fred was constantly on the lookout for get- rich-quick schemes, while Barney, like Norton, found life satisfactory as it was, but participated in said schemes because Fred was his friend. Usually, after Fred had hatched one of his plans, Barney showed his agreement by laughing and saying, \\"Uh hee hee hee... OK, Fred!\\" or \\"Hee hee hee... whatever you say, Fred!\\" In early episodes, Barney had a New Jersey accent but was soon changed to a deeper, more chuckle-like voice. In \\"On the Rocks\\" and the late 2000s his Jersey accent returns. Barney's interests included bowling, playing pool, poker, tinkering around in Fred's garage, and playing golf (though in some episodes, Barney did not know how to play golf). He, like Fred, was also a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes lodge and its predecessor in earlier episodes, the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs. He is also a talented pianist and drummer.\\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\\" The Flintstones, season 1 In the first episode of the original series, he was an inventor of a human-powered helicopter.\\"The Flintstone Flyer\\" Season 1 episode 1 Another time Barney actually built an advanced sports car racer; which almost but did not win a $50.000 race because the cars stone wheels crumbled at the last minute.\\"Indianrockaplis 500\\" Season 5 Although clearly depicted as being in better shape than Fred, he is not shown to be quite as enthusiastic a sportsman as Fred is. This distinction can be attributed to Fred's fondness for food, though Barney is shown to be almost as capable of excessive appetite on a number of occasions. Biography Barney grew up at 142 Boulder Avenue in Granitetown [north of Bedrock]. He was acknowledged to be the maternal nephew of Fred Flintstone‚Äôs boss, Mr. George Slate.\\"Fred's New Boss,\\" The Flintstones, season 3 As young adults, Barney and Fred worked as bellhops at a resort, where they first met Wilma and Betty, who were working as cigarette girls.\\"Bachelor Daze,\\" The Flintstones, season 4 Eventually, Barney married Betty (as Fred did Wilma). Several episodes and spinoffs suggest that Barney, along with Fred, spent some time in the army early in their marriages, though said references may be to Barney and Fred's military service in the first- season episode \\"The Astr'nuts.\\" While the subject of Barney's occupation (or even if he had one) was never given during the original series, the majority of subsequent spinoffs suggest at some point after the original series, Barney went to work at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company quarry alongside Fred as a fellow dino-crane operator. An early episode of the original series does have a brief scene of Barney working at the Granite Building.\\"The Babysitters,\\" The Flintstones, season 1 When speaking to an upper-crust snob in another episode, Betty declares Barney is in \\"top-secret\\" work, but that might have been a cover for a low-level job or unemployment, or perhaps an in-joke meaning that Barney's job was unknown even to the show's writers. It could also be possible that both Fred and Barney work at the quarry, but may work in different sections of it, under different bosses. In one episode, Barney's boss tells him to \\"put down his broom\\", which implies some sort of janitorial work is involved. While the voices of the other characters were based on their The Honeymooners counterparts, Mel Blanc was asked to model Barney's voice after the voice of Ed Norton, but he reportedly refused, thinking that it was stealing a voice from another actor, and, for the first 15 episodes of season 1, gave Barney a much higher-pitched New Jersey accent to the point of portraying him as a smart-aleck, though towards the later part of the season he eventually relented and Barney's smart-alecky personality was slowly toned down. At the end of season 1, Blanc was involved in a near-fatal car crash, which sent him into a two-week long coma. Daws Butler briefly assumed the role for the first, second, fifth, sixth and ninth episodes of season 2 while Blanc recovered from the accident, continuing to deliver a Norton-inspired performance. Incidentally, Butler was also the original voice of Yogi Bear, who was also inspired by the character of Ed Norton. When Blanc woke from his coma, he was able to return to the show much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's voice for Barney had changed considerably after the accident, going from the New Jersey smart-aleck voice to a deeper, more chuckle-like voice, quite similar to that of Hugo the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes, and he was shown as somewhat dopier than before. One episode even had Barney's voice change from Butler's to Blanc's right in the middle of the episode. During the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \\"Bamm-Bamm\\". A court battle ensued between the couple and a wealthy man who also had wanted to adopt Bamm-Bamm. Barney and Betty were successful in their efforts to adopt Bam-Bam because the wealthy man gave up (after winning the case) upon learning his wife became pregnant, after which he became a staple character on the series.\\"Little Bamm- Bamm,\\" The Flintstones, season 4 For the next nine episodes (though Bamm-Bamm aired on \\"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\\" in the opening scene teaser but not in the body of the episode but would return two episodes later) after Bamm-Bamm's debut, no sign of him is seen on the show. This was because, while \\"Little Bamm-Bamm\\" was made after these episodes, it aired before. Once more episodes were made Bam-Bam aired regularly. In the fifth season, the family buys a pet hopparoo (a combination of a kangaroo and dinosaur) named Hoppy. When Bamm- Bamm grew into a teenager, Barney joined the Bedrock police force with Fred for a period of time as part-time officers. Both characters were paired with the Shmoo from Li'l Abner. He later became grandfather to Pebbles's and Bamm- Bamm's children, Chip and Roxy. Although Fred and Barney are best friends, Barney loses his patience with Fred occasionally. The best example comes in \\"I Yabba-Dabba Do!\\": after losing his patience with Fred for ruining Pebbles's and Bamm-Bamm's wedding, Barney decides to leave Bedrock. He changes his mind after Fred apologizes. Fred is often annoyed by Barney's inveterate cheerfulness, but he does truly care for him. In the series' original episodes until the end of season 5, Barney's eyes are drawn as ovals or (occasionally) dark circular outlines (similar to Little Orphan Annie in her comics). In other episodes, and on all the season 6 ones, they are solid black, similar to Wilma's eyes. On three occasions we see the whites of his eyes: in \\"The Engagement Ring\\", \\"Ventriloquist Barney\\", and \\"A Haunted House Is Not a Home\\". In \\"The Engagement Ring\\", we see Barney's whites when Fred suggests that he spar with a fearsome boxer to earn enough money to buy Betty a belated engagement ring. In \\"Ventriloquist Barney\\", he describes the terrifying facial features of wrestler Bronto Crushrock. In \\"A Haunted House Is Not a Home\\", Barney frightens Fred by gargling in the bathroom too loudly, provoking Fred to hit Barney on the head.

This was the 13th episode for the eighth season. It aired on January 30, 1997. The episode was written by Gregg Kavet & Andy Robin and was directed by David Owen Trainor. In the episode, George Costanza goes to great lengths to deliver a retort (the eponymous comeback) to a coworker that he thought of too late to deliver on the spot (a phenomenon described by the French expression \\"L'esprit de l'escalier\\"). Jerry Seinfeld learns the proprietor of a tennis pro shop is a bad tennis player. After seeing a movie, Cosmo Kramer decides he needs a living will. Elaine Benes has a tragic romance with a video rental shop worker who shares her taste in movies. Plot George's coworker Reilly notices him stuffing himself with shrimp cocktail at a meeting and remarks: \\"Hey George, the ocean called; they're running out of shrimp.\\" After the meeting, George thinks up a comeback: \\"Well, the Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you.\\" He becomes obsessed with recreating the encounter so that he can make use of this comeback, despite Jerry, Elaine and Kramer all telling him that the comeback makes no sense. Reilly changes jobs to Firestone in Akron, Ohio. George flies there to attend a meeting, and brings a tray of shrimp, prompting Reilly to repeat his \\"ocean\\" zinger. When George delivers the comeback, Reilly simply shoots back \\"What's the difference? You're their all-time bestseller.\\" In desperation, George claims he had sex with Reilly's wife. This reduces the room to an offended silence, since Reilly's wife is in a coma. After arriving back in New York, George thinks of a new comeback: \\"The life support machine called...\\", and makes a U-turn so he can fly back to Akron and deliver it. While browsing the staff picks at Champagne Video, Elaine becomes a fan of Vincent's picks. While Elaine is watching a Vincent pick, he calls her on the telephone. Elaine becomes romantically interested in him, but he refuses to meet her in person. On a subsequent visit to the video store, Elaine craves something lighter than the tearjerkers which dominate Vincent's picks. Kramer convinces her to try a Gene pick, Weekend at Bernie's II. Vincent feels betrayed by this, terminates their relationship, and stops making picks. After Elaine rents Vincent's pick that she spurned in favor of Weekend at Bernie's II, Vincent agrees to meet her at his apartment if she brings some vodka, cigarettes and fireworks. When she arrives, he refuses to open the door all the way. His mother opens the door, revealing that Vincent is 15 years old. Mortified, Elaine takes the vodka from the bag and walks off. At a pro tennis shop, Jerry is pressured into buying a high end racquet by the worker there ‚Äî an Eastern European man named Milo≈°. While playing at a tennis club with Elaine, Jerry discovers that Milo≈° is a horrible tennis player. In Jerry's eyes, this undermines Milo≈°' credibility as a salesman. Milo≈° offers to do anything in exchange for Jerry not revealing his secret. While in the shop, Jerry's eye is caught by an attractive woman. The woman, named Patty, waits for him outside his apartment. She propositions him for sex, but recoils in shame, revealing that she is Milo≈°' wife and was instructed to seduce Jerry by her husband. The incident makes her lose respect for Milo≈°. Kramer rents a straight-to-video movie about a woman in a coma. Frightened by the movie, he has a living will drawn up. He retains a lawyer named Shellbach, with Elaine as his executor, and opts to have his life support terminated in all but the most extreme cases. Kramer finishes watching the movie, in which the woman comes out of the coma. Not having known that it is possible to awake from a coma, he resolves to get his living will annulled, but misses his appointment. He learns that he can catch up with Shellbach at the tennis club. Milo≈° asks Jerry to let him win a game of tennis to regain Patty's respect. During the game, Milo≈° derides Jerry's tennis ability. Frustrated at Milo≈°' taunts, Jerry begins to play for real. He hits a ball wide of Milo≈°, who swings wildly at it, releasing his racquet into the air. It comes down on another tennis player, who falls on a ball machine, redirecting its aim to Kramer's head. Kramer collapses and ends up in the hospital. When Elaine visits him, looking for an outlet for her VCR, she unplugs a large plug. Kramer wakes up and, seeing the plug in Elaine's hand, thinks she just removed his life-support. Cultural references The relationship between Elaine and Vincent is a reference to The Phantom of the Opera, which was in its 9th year on Broadway at the time. Production The tennis court scenes in this episode were set in an indoor court, but the crew could not find an available indoor court in all of Los Angeles to use as a filming location. To compensate, they used a massive crane to drape a large tent over an outdoor tennis court, making it look like an indoor court. Unfortunately, this episode was filmed during the period when El Ni√±o was beginning to affect the weather patterns in the United States, resulting in heavy rain in Los Angeles on the week the crew needed to shoot their tennis court scenes. The rain collected on the outside of the tent, and several large puddles can be seen on the court in several shots in the episode. The tent finally collapsed in a heap shortly after filming of the master shots wrapped, so the remaining footage was filmed back at the studio on a makeshift half-court set. The role of Vincent was played by Danny Strong and voiced by Robby Benson. In real life, Strong was knowledgeable about films from an early age. He would rent videos from Video Archives, becoming friends with Quentin Tarantino, who worked there as a clerk. \\"I would just literally sit and chat with him for 45 minutes, an hour at a time about movies, and he got me turned on to all these different movies that 10 year olds don't see... He was a fantastic video store clerk, because he was such a movie buff. He had so much knowledge of films, that he would try to get people to watch really cool movies.\\" The role of Reilly was played by character actor Joel Polis.  Critical reception  David Sims of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"Things are pretty disconnected in this episode, although Kramer, Jerry and Elaine all sorta come together by the end (just for a cheap, quick gag, but it's a decent one)... Elaine's romance with Vincent (played, oh so briefly, by a young Danny Strong) is more fun, although as a Phantom of the Opera spoof it feels very stale... But I like the communication that goes on between them through the video aisles and Vincent's battle for artistic supremacy with the more middle-of- the-road Gene (whose recommendation of Weekend at Bernie's 2 doesn't go over well with Elaine). It turns out, of course, that Vincent is a teenager leveraging Elaine to buy him vodka, fireworks and cigarettes. The connection between these episodes, actually, is how pitiful Elaine's romantic prospects have become (while the boys continue to date increasingly beautiful specimens).\\" Nick Suss wrote for the site StoriesHouse, \\"Like most episodes of Seinfeld, The Comeback wove four plots together seamlessly while connecting each of them with conversation. The episode was witty, silly, poignant and above all else laden with quotes. Most notably, this episode led us to all references to \\"The Jerk Store,\\" to which we owe the writing staff a great deal of debt. (Think about it: without \\"The Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you!,\\" we probably wouldn't have had the Toilet Store remark from Anchorman and we would all be much sadder as a result. Food for thought.) In other news, the show also featured Jerry getting tennis lessons from a poor tennis player, Elaine dating a teenager over the phone and Kramer filling out his last will and testament... Even if the first few episodes started off slowly as many say they did, the episodes which were easily the most enjoyable were in fact those. It just holds testament to how much we loved the show and still love the show that the idea of a comeback was so enticing.\\"  References External links * * Category:Seinfeld (season 8) episodes Category:1997 American television episodes ","title":"The Comeback (Seinfeld)"},{"id":"1501094","text":"The tribe of Shammar () is a tribal Arab Qahtanite confederation, descended from the ancient Yemeni tribe of Tayy. It is one of the largest and most influential Arab tribes. The historical and traditional seat of the tribe's leadership is in the city of Ha'il in what was the Emirate of Jabal Shammar in Saudi Arabia. In its \\"golden age\\", around 1850, the tribe ruled much of central and northern Arabia from Riyadh to the frontiers of Syria and the vast area known as Al Jazira in Northern Iraq. One of the early famous figures from the tribe was the legendary Hatim Al-Ta'i (Hatim of Tayy; died 578), a Christian Arab renowned for generosity and hospitality who figured in the Arabian Nights. The early Islamic historical sources report that his son, Adiyy ibn Hatim, whom they sometimes refer to as the \\"king\\" of Tayy, converted to Islam before Muhammad's death. Another figure from Tayy during this period was Zayd al-Khayr, a prominent member of Tayy who is said to have led Tayy's delegation to Muhammad accepting Islam. Origins The Shammar are a tribal confederation made up of three main branches: the Abdah, the Aslam, and the Zoba. The tribe of Shammar are descendants of the Tayy tribe of Yemen. The earliest non-Arab sources refer to Arabs as Taits, thought of as referring to the Tayy, as Ayas ibn Quasiba, a ruler of ancient Iraq, had contact with both the Byzantine and Persian Empires. Since some sections of Tayy, and most of the Ghassanids and Muntherids, were present in Mesopotamia and the Levant prior to Muhammad's preaching of Islam in the early 7th century. In the NamƒÅrah Inscription (the second oldest pre-Islamic Arabic inscription, dating from 328 CE), the name \\"Shammar\\" is believed to refer to a city in Yemen, though it may refer to the city where the Himyarite King Shammar Yahri'sh lived, the present-day Rada (located about from Dhamar, an ancient historic site). Since King Shammar Yahri'sh ruled during the last decade of the 3rd century AD, it could be referring to the city he lived in or one named after him. It could also be referring to the city of Hayel, although there is no evidence that Imru Al-Qays fought the Tayy. Led by Usma bin Luai the Tayy invaded the mountains of Ajaa and Salma from Banu Assad and Banu Tamim in northern Arabia in their exodus from Yemen in 115 CE. These mountains are now known as the Shammar. The Tayy became nomadic camel-herders and horse-breeders in northern Nejd for centuries. Because of their strength and blood relations with the Yemenite dynasties that came to rule Syria (The Ghassanids) and Iraq (The Lakhmids), the Tayy expanded north into Iraq all the way to the capital at the time, Al-Hirah. The area of the two mountains subsequently came to be known as \\"Jabal Shammar\\" (\\"Shammar's Mountain\\") from the 14th century, the first time that the Shammar as a tribe were noted in literature. History Led by Usma bin Luai, the Tayy invaded the mountains of Ajaa and Salma from Banu Assad and Banu Tamim in northern Arabia in their exodus from Yemen in 115 CE. These mountains were renamed to Jabal Tayy (Tayy's Mountain), and then again in the 14th century, after the tribe changed their name, to Jabal Shammar. There, Tayy, later Shammar, became urbanised city-dwellers in the city of Ha'il, nomadic pastoralists, camel-herders and horse-breeders in northern Najd, or agriculturists in the countryside outside Ha'il or in the surrounding desert oases. These divisions were based on profession, personal interest and skill, and not family or blood-line stratifications within the tribe. It is common for the same nuclear family to have members living each of the three different lifestyles. Because of their strength and blood relations with the Yemenite dynasties that came to rule Syria (Ghassanids) and Iraq (Muntherids), the Tayy expanded north into Iraq all the way to al-Hira, the capital at the time. Oral tradition mentions that the first chiefs of the Shammar tribe, Arar and Omair, were of the 'Abda family of Dhaigham, who ruled Shammar from Jabal Shammar. In the 17th century, a large section of the Shammar left Jabal Shammar under the leadership of the Al Jarba and settled in Iraq, reaching as far as the northern city of Mosul, their current stronghold. The Shammar are currently one of Iraq's largest tribes and are divided into two geographical, as opposed to genealogical, subsections. The northern branch, known as Shammar al-Jarba, is mainly Sunni, while the southern branch, Shammar Toga, converted to Shia Islam around the 19th centuryThe Shi'is of Iraq.Yitzhak Nakash, p.27Haydari, ‚ÄòUnwan al-Majd, pg. 110-15, 118‚ÄòAbdallah Mahmud Shukri (al-Alusi), ‚ÄúDi‚Äôayat al-Rafd wa al-Khurafat wa al-Tafriq Bayn al-Muslimin‚Äù, al-Manar 29 (1928): 440 after settling in southern Iraq. The Shammar that remained in Arabia had tribal territories extending from the city of Ha'il northwards to the frontiers of the Syrian Desert. The Shammar had a long traditional rivalry with the confederation of 'Anizzah, who inhabited the same area. The city of Ha'il became the heart of the Jabal Shammar region and was inhabited largely by settled members of Shammar and their clients. Two clans succeeded each other in ruling the city in the 19th century. The first clan, the Al Ali, were replaced by the Al Rashid. During the civil war that tore apart the Second Saudi State in the late 19th century, the emirs of Ha'il, from the house of Al Rashid, intervened and gradually took control of much of the Saudi realm, finally taking the Saudi capital Riyadh in 1895 and expelling the Saudi leaders to Kuwait. The Bedouin Shammari tribesmen provided the majority of the Al Rashid's military support. Later, in the first two decades of the 20th century, Al Rashid were defeated by Ibn Saud and his Wahhabi forces when his campaign to restore his family's rule in the Arabian Peninsula culminated in the Conquest of Ha'il in 1921. Following Al Rashid's defeat many Shammar fled to Syria and Iraq. Eventually the clan of their uncles, Al Sabhan pledged allegiance to Ibn Saud in Riyadh. Ibn Saud also married a daughter of one of the Shammari chiefs, who bore him one Saudi King, Abdullah. After the establishment of modern borders, most Bedouins gradually left their nomadic lifestyle. Today, most members of the Shammar live modern, urbanised lifestyles in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and some sections settled in Syria and Jordan. Despite this, the vast majority of Shammar continue to retain a strong tribal identity and loyalty to their tribe. Many also participate in Cultural Festivals to learn about their ancient lifestyles, and to take part in traditional activities such as folk dancing. House of Rashid The House of Rasheed were a historic Shammar dynasty on the Arabian Peninsula. They were the most formidable enemies of the House of Saud in Nejd. They were centered in Ha'il, a city in northern Nejd that derived its wealth from being on the route of the Hajj. The Al Rasheed derived their name from the grandfather of Abdullah, the first Rasheedi amir of Ha'il, who was named Rasheed. The Rasheedi emirs cooperated closely with the Ottoman Empire. However, this cooperation became problematic as the Ottomans lost popularity. As with many Arab dynasties, the lack of a generally accepted rule of succession was a recurrent problem with Rasheedi rule. The internal dispute normally centered on whether succession should be horizontal (i.e. to a brother) or vertical (to a son). These divisions within the family led to bloody infighting. In the last years of the nineteenth century six Rasheedi leaders died violently. Nevertheless, The Al Rasheed family continued to rule and fight together against Ibn Saud. Saudi Arabia- The first twenty years of the 20th century on the Arabian Peninsula featured a long-running series of wars as the Saudis and their allies sought to unite the peninsula. Some members of the Rasheed family left the country and went into voluntary exile, mostly to Iraq. Iraq The Shammar is Iraq's largest Arab tribe, along with the Jubur, with more than 1.5 million members. Under the leadership of Banu Mohamad, known as Al Jarba, there was a massive exodus into Iraq. Most of the Shammar in Iraq gave up the nomadic life to settle in major cities, especially the Jazirah plain, the area between the Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad to Mosul. Droughts triggered several migrations of Shammar into Iraq, which, according to the Ottoman census upon its annexation, had only 1.5 million inhabitants. The Shammar took over the Jazirah after displacing Al-Ubaid tribe. According to Sheikh Abdullah Humaid Alyawar, the son of the sheikh of Shammar, in Iraq the total population of Shammar is estimated to be more than 1.5 million. The Shammar Al-Sayeh, a tribal confederation of tribes from Shammar, is the branch of Shammar who were independent of Aljraba's authority. Shammar is composed of groups such as Al-Zuhairy and Al-Towej in Najaf. The Shammar became one of the most powerful Iraqi tribes, owning vast tracts of land and provided strong support of the Hashemite monarchy. Shammar power was threatened after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958 by Abdul-Karim Qassem, and the Shammar welcomed Ba'athist rule. After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Ghazi al-Yawar, from the Al Jarbah clan, was unanimously chosen as interim president. Al-Yawar uncle is the current Sheikh of Sheikhs of Shammar. Syria The Shammar tribe have been present in Syria since at least the 1920s when rivalry between Syrian and Iraqi Shammar culminated in violence reported by the League of Nations in 1926. Syrian Shammar Sheikh Diham al Hadi, the paramount Shammar sheikh in Syria, conducted an attack at the end of March 1926 upon 'Ajil al Yawar, a Sheikh of the Iraqi Shammar. In April 1959 however, the CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service reported that the Iraqi and Syrian branches of the Shammar were able to bury their differences, both joining an alliance with the Syrian Baath Party against a common enemy. The current leader of the Syrian Shammar is Sheikh Humaydi Daham al-Hadi. His son Bandar al-Humaydi is military leader of al-Sanadid Forces, a Shammar militia formed in 2013 nominally to protect the tribe's interests from ISIL.

The company was set up in 1911 by the aviation pioneer Louis Charles Breguet. Br√©guet Aviation was extremely active during the First World War, producing numerous military aircraft, such as the pioneering metal Br√©guet 14 day-bomber, for the Allies. During the interwar period, the firm's aircraft set several records for non-stop crossings of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as with the unconventional Br√©guet- Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was active during the Second World War, surviving the conflict and largely focusing on commercial transport aircraft during the postwar years. Its most notable military programmes during the Cold War include the Br√©guet 1150 Atlantic and the SEPECAT Jaguar. During 1971, Br√©guet Aviation merged with Dassault to form Avions Marcel Dassault-Br√©guet Aviation, which was subsequently rebranded as Dassault Aviation. History The company was founded during 1911 by Louis-Charles Breguet, an early French airplane designer and builder, and his brother, Jacques. That same year, Br√©guet's first airplane established a new speed record during a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) flight. In 1912, Br√©guet constructed his first seaplane. During the First World War, the company produced a range of military-orientated aircraft to assist the French war effort. In particular, it developed capable reconnaissance aircraft that saw used not only during the conflict but long into the 1920s as well. During this time, Br√©guet Aviation also played a pioneering role in the development of metal aircraft, such as the Br√©guet 14 day-bomber (almost entirely made of aluminum), which was one of the most famous French combat aircraft of its era. The Br√©guet-14's performance was such it was not only procured by the French military, but also exported to the fill the ranks of sixteen squadrons of the American Expeditionary Force. Unable to meet wartime demands for its designs itself, production agreements were made with other firms to produce its aircraft as well. Between 1917 and 1919, just under 2,000 Br√©guet-designed aircraft were license-produced by the aviation interest of French industrial conglomerate Michelin. During the interwar period, Br√©guet-built aircraft set several records; one plane performed the first non-stop crossing of the South Atlantic in 1927, while another made a 4,500-mile (7,242-kilometer) flight across the Atlantic Ocean during 1933, which was the longest non-stop Atlantic flight up to that time. During the 1930s, the firm developed the unconventional Br√©guet-Dorand Gyroplane Laboratoire, which flew by a combination of blade flapping and feathering. on 22 December 1935, this aircraft established a Federation Aeronautique Internationale speed record of 67 miles per hour (108 kilometers per hour), while the type also set an altitude record of 517 feet (158 meters) during the following year. Br√©guet was engaged in the rearmament efforts during the late 1930s, producing numerous military aircraft in the run-up to and during the Second World War. After resuming normal operations in the immediatepostwar climate, the company largely focused on the development of commercial transports and other large aircraft designs. On 4 May 1955, the company's founder, Louis-Charles Br√©guet, died in Paris, France. In response to a NATO specification for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft to replace the Lockheed P2V Neptune, Br√©guet submitted its own design, the Br 1150, which was chosen as the winner in late 1958. Accordingly, a multinational consortium, Soci√©t√© d'√âtude et de Construction de Br√©guet Atlantic (SECBAT) was set up to develop and build this aircraft, which was named the 1150 Atlantic.Air International November 1981, pp. 218, 252.Elvert, Schirmann and Lang 2008, p. 182. An initial order for 60 Atlantics 40 for France and 20 for Germany was placed in 1963; deliveries of the Atlantic commenced during 1965. The production line was reactivated following further orders from the Netherlands and Italy; this second production batch made its deliveries between 1972 and 1974.Air International November 1981, pp. 252‚Äì253. During 1978, the French Government authorised development of an updated version of the Atlantic, the Atlantic Nouvelle G√©n√©ration or Atlantique 2, which involved little change to either airframe and engines while equipment and avionics were extensively revised.Air International November 1981, pp. 216‚Äì218.\\"Maritime Muscle\\".

Flight International, 4 August 1999. During the 1960s, Br√©guet Aviation became involved in the multinational joint venture company SEPECAT (Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Production de l'Avion d'√âcole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique ‚Äì the \\"European company for the production of a combat trainer and tactical support aircraft\\"Wagner 2009, p. 122.) together with the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) to produce the Jaguar strike aircraft. Though based in part on the Breguet Br.121, using the same basic configuration and an innovative French-designed landing gear, the Jaguar was built incorporating major elements of design from BAC ‚Äì notably the wing and high lift devices.Jackson 1992, pp. 58, 71. Production of components was split between Breguet and BAC, while the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; one in the UK and one in France,Bowman 2007, pp. 14‚Äì17. To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source.Flight 16 October 1969, p. 600. Early on, collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well;Jackson 1992, p. 58. however, following Dassault's takeover of Breguet in 1971, the firm encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super √âtendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would receive more workshare and profit, over the Jaguar.Wallace 1984, p. 27.Jackson 1992, p. 77.

During the Second World War the company produced an electric car powered by batteries and propelled by an \\"off-the-shelf\\" motor from Paris-Rh√¥ne. The motor was capable of producing two different levels of output. \\"First gear\\" and \\"Reverse gear\\" were provided with 36 volts, while \\"Second gear\\" equated to 72 volts. An advertisement for the car in 1941 claimed a range of between charges without mentioning that this range was only available where adhering to steady cruising speed of 20 km/h (12 mph). Cruising at a steady 40 km/h (25 mph) would, on the same basis, have given a range of . The car had a modern looking all-enveloping two-seater body with a relatively long tapered tail which contained the motor and some of the batteries. It had four wheels, but the rear axle, which delivered power to the road, was relatively narrow. The car was actively marketed during 1941 which was a period of price instability. In August 1941 the Br√©guet electric car was priced at 56,000 francs: during the same month the Citro√´n Light bodied 11 (still listed, despite production by now being down to a trickle or suspended) was priced at 35,630 francs. The Br√©guet electric car was produced not at the firm's principal plant at Toulouse but at a smaller plant at Anglet (between Biarritz and Bayonne).

A subdistrict of the Bywater District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Florida Avenue to the north, the Industrial Canal to the east, the Mississippi River to the south, and the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the west. Bywater is part of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans; but it is located along the natural levee of the Mississippi River, sparing the area from significant flooding. It includes part or all of Bywater Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During New Orleans Mardi Gras, the Society of Saint Anne marching krewe starts their procession on Mardi Gras morning in Bywater and gathers marchers as it travels through the French Quarter, ending at Canal Street. This walking parade of local residents, artists, and performers is preceded by the Bywater Bone Boys Social Aid and Pleasure Club (founded 2005), an early-rising skeleton krewe made up of writers, tattoo artists, painters, set designers, musicians, and numerous other pre-7 a.m. revelers. After Hurricane Katrina, many survivors flocked to the area as it was less affected by the storm, due to the slightly higher elevation closer to the Mississippi river. Bywater became part of what was known as the \\"Sliver by the River,\\" meaning neighborhoods that saw no flooding, including Faubourg Marigny, the French Quarter and Irish Channel neighborhoods, and parts of the lower Garden District including St. Charles Avenue. Geography Bywater is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of , of which is land and (29.32%) of which is water. Adjacent neighborhoods * Desire Area (north) * Lower Ninth Ward (east) * Holy Cross (east) * Mississippi River (south) * Marigny (west) * St. Claude (west) * Florida Area (west) Boundaries The traditional boundaries of Bywater are: the Mississippi River to St. Claude Avenue, and the railroad tracks along Homer Plessy Way (formerly Press Street) to the Industrial Canal. Press Street's name came from a cotton press (known elsewhere as a cotton compress) which operated here during the 19th century. The Bywater/Marigny stretch of Press Street was changed to Homer Plessy Way in 2018 to memorialize Homer Plessy, the plaintiff in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 5,096 people, 2,263 households, and 1,030 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 5,421 /mi¬≤ (2,123 /km¬≤). As of the census of 2010, there were 3,337 people, 1,763 households, and 573 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 5,421 /mi¬≤ (2,123 /km¬≤). History The area now known as Bywater was mostly plantation land in the colonial era, with significant residential development beginning the first decade of the 19th century as part of what was known as \\"Faubourg Washington,\\" part of the predominantly Francophone \\"downtown\\" section of New Orleans. Many people from France, Spain, and the French Caribbean settled here. During the century, it grew with both white Creoles of French and Spanish descent, as well as mixed-race Creoles of French, Spanish, African, and Native American descent. They were also joined by immigrants from Germany, Italy, and Ireland. The Bywater is home to the site at which Homer Plessy was removed from an East Louisiana Railroad car for violating the separate car act, an event that resulted in the Plessy v. Ferguson case and the legal doctrine of \\"separate but equal.\\" Today, a historical marker stands at the intersection of Press Street and Royal Street to commemorate the event. There was little distinction between this area and what became known as the Lower 9th Ward until the Industrial Canal was dredged in the early 20th century, dividing the two. A generation knew the area as the \\"Upper 9th Ward,\\" but as other parts of the 9th Ward above the Canal farther from the River became developed, a more specific name was needed. Inspired by the local telephone exchange designation of Bywater, which fit the neighborhood's proximity to the River and the Canal, the neighborhood was known as \\"Bywater\\" by the 1940s. Real estate development and speculation surrounding the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition prompted many long-term French Quarter residents to move down river, at first into Marigny. By the late 1990s the bohemian, artistic type of communities such as were found in the French Quarter mid-20th century had spread to Bywater, and many long-neglected 19th-century houses began to be refurbished. Bywater and neighboring Faubourg Marigny are two of the most colorful neighborhoods in the city. The architectural styles borrow heavily from the colonial French and Spanish and have elements of the Caribbean. This blending over the last three centuries has resulted in an architectural style unique to the city of New Orleans. As the section of Bywater on the River side of St. Claude Avenue was one of the few portions of the 9th Ward to escape major flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it has made steady progress toward recovery, more so than many other parts of the city.

Fictional character biography Because of a lightning strike on a plane, the cosmic entity Kismet and Sharon Vance (Clark Kent's childhood friend from Smallville) became one entity known as the Strange Visitor.Superman #149 (October 1999) She had become a being of pure electromagnetic energy, and was drawn to the laboratories of Professor Emil Hamilton, who still had one of Superman's containment suits (from a period when he was temporarily converted to electromagnetic energy). Emil modified the suit to fit her since test results showed that her energy field was dissolving, and the suit would help her maintain solid form. Her memories were weak, and even though she easily used her powers to magnetically levitate trains over destroyed tracks, destroy alien attackers with an electromagnetic pulse, and absorb the powers of a self-proclaimed \\"god of war\\", she still wasn't sure who she really was. Even more disturbing was the fact that her emotional state was affecting her powers, and when she became angry or upset, her power levels surged to the point where her containment suit was almost unable to handle all of the energy.Adventures of Superman #572 (November 1999)Action Comics #759 (November 1999) If the suit were to fail, she would lose her physical form. A battle with the Parasite restores her powers and her memories.Man of Steel #94 (November 1999) She later went on to become a hero in her own city. She fought Gorilla Grodd in New York, but was accused of attacking a \\"monkey\\". In Batman: Our Worlds at War (Aug 2001) it is seen that a facility under control of Lex Luthor is keeping tabs on her.Superboy (vol. 4) #89 (August 2001) When the Imperiex fleet attacks Earth, Strange Visitor gives all of her powers to Superman to give him the necessary power boost to defeat Imperiex.Superman #176 (October 2001) He defeats the powerful entity by cracking his armour and draining his energy, an act which ended her life (although she noted that 'Sharon Vance' had died when she was created and what was left to form Strange Visitor was just the essence of Sharon giving her a personality), while opening the way for Superman to vanquish Imperiex and save the universe. Powers and abilities Strange Visitor is connected to the Earth's geomagnetic field, and has the power to manipulate electromagnetic energies, which enables her to fire blasts of electrical energy from her hands or eyes, generate magnetic fields to move, lift, and manipulate metal objects, create force fields, steal energy from others, and even \\"read\\" an object's magnetic field. She also has the power to fly at near light speeds, lower her density to walk through solid matter, and telepathically sense emotions. In other media A normal version of Sharon Vance appears in the Young Justice: Invasion episode \\"True Colors\\", voiced by Masasa Moyo. She appears as a tour guide at a Lexcorp farming facility.

The Kennel Club of India (KCI) and Indian National Kennel Club (INKC) recognize the breed under different breed names. The KCI registers it as a Caravan Hound while the INKC uses the name Mudhol Hound. In 2005 the Mudhol Hound was one of four Indian dog breeds featured on a set of postage stamps released by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to celebrate the country's canine heritage. thumb About 750 families in and around Mudhol town of Karnataka are raising this breed for marketing the puppies. History The Caravan was introduced to the Deccan Plateau of western India from Central Asia and Arabia, and can thus be considered a direct descendant of the Saluki or TƒÅzƒ´. This region covers parts of the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and, to a lesser degree, Telangana. The breed is popular in and around Mudhol Taluk of Karnataka and thus the breed got the name Mudhol hound. Shrimant Rajesaheb Malojirao Ghorpade of Mudhol (1884-1937) of the Mudhol State is credited with reviving the Mudhol hound. He noticed local tribal people called Bedar (Fearless); also called Berad (not - crying) using these hounds for hunting. Using selective breeding, he was able to restore the royal Mudhol hound. On a visit to England in the early 1900s, the Maharaja of Mudhol State presented King George V a pair of hounds, which popularized the Mudhol hound breed. The Indian Army has expressed its desire to use the Mudhol sight hound for surveillance and border protection duties. It has obtained six Mudhol dogs for testing at the Army's Remount Veterinary Corps at Meerut. The dogs were bred after selection, at the Canine Research and Information Centre in Thimmapur near Mudhol in Bagalkot district of Karnataka. The CRIC is a unit of the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University, Bidar.
