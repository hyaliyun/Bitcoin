The population was 59 at the 2010 census. While Ohiopyle has a tiny year-round population, it is often filled with tourists on the weekend, who come for the outdoor recreation opportunities at the surrounding Ohiopyle State Park, as well as the Great Allegheny Passage bicycle trail which connects with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath trail to form a continuous 335-mile off-road trail from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. The borough of Ohiopyle is served by the Uniontown Area School District. History=Native Americans The first known group of people to inhabit the Ohiopyle area were the Monongahela, a clan of the Mound Builders. These Native Americans disappeared from the scene just as European colonists were beginning to arrive in North America. As the east coast was settled, the Native Americans who lived closer to the Atlantic Ocean were exterminated or forced to flee to the west. Various tribes inhabited the Ohiopyle area at this time, preceding their ultimate removal following the French and Indian War. One of the few remnants of American Indian culture that can be found in the area is in the name. \\"Ohiopyle\\" is derived from the Lenape phrase ' which means 'it turns very white', referring to the frothy waterfalls. French and Indian War The colonial powers of New France and the British Thirteen Colonies fought for control of the trading routes in the Ohio River Valley in what was at the time the northwestern frontier of America. The French were the first to explore the upper reaches of the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. They built several forts in what is now western Pennsylvania, including Fort Duquesne in what is now Pittsburgh. Fort Duquesne was built on the remains of Fort Prince George which the French had seized from the British. George Washington was sent by the colonial governor of Virginia to try to retake the all-important fort at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. He was on two expeditions that passed through the Ohiopyle area. Washington tried to use the Youghiogheny River as a means to reach Fort Duquesne quickly, but was forced to abandon the river passage by the waterfalls in the Ohiopyle area. Still Washington pressed on to the Pittsburgh area. His troops encountered and routed a small party of French soldiers in the Battle of Jumonville Glen. One of these soldiers escaped to Fort Duquesne. Washington was forced to quickly build a fort to prepare for the oncoming French attack. Fort Necessity is just to the southwest of Ohiopyle State Park. The colonial forces of Washington were overwhelmed by the French and their Indian allies in the Battle of the Great Meadows at Fort Necessity. These battles are considered the opening shots of the French and Indian War which would spread to the Old World and become the Seven Years' War. The loss at Fort Necessity marked Washington's only military surrender. The British ultimately won the French and Indian war and the French were forced to leave western Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania or Virginia? In 1763 King George III declared the area an Indian reserve and required all European settlers to leave. The settlers refused to leave, and King George bought the land from the Iroquois in 1768. The land was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. The dispute of the territory lasted through the American Revolution and was not resolved until 1784. Whiskey Rebellion The Whiskey Rebellion was a major test for the new government of the United States following the Revolution. The citizens of western Pennsylvania, mostly near Washington, Pennsylvania, were not pleased with the excise tax on liquor and distilled drinks. This tax had been proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, passed by Congress, and signed into law by President Washington in 1791. The tensions of the whiskey tax intensified over the next three years and in 1794 there was a state of insurrection in the area. Thirteen thousand militiamen under the direct command of George Washington were sent to put down the insurrection. They passed through the Ohiopyle area on their way to arrest the rebels. The rebels \\"could never be found,\\" according to Thomas Jefferson, but the militia rounded up twenty prisoners, clearly demonstrating Federalist authority in the national government. The men were imprisoned, where one died, while two were convicted of treason and sentenced to death by hanging. Washington, however, pardoned them on the grounds that one was a \\"simpleton\\" and the other \\"insane.\\" The military suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion set a precedent that U.S. citizens who wished to change the law had to do so peacefully through constitutional means; otherwise, the government would meet any threats to disturb the peace with force. Lumbering and tourism The earliest settlers to the Ohiopyle area were farmers, trappers and hunters. The population of the area expanded after the building of the National Road in 1811. This road that passed near Ohiopyle increased the accessibility of the area and connected it to eastern markets. Lumbering became the dominant industry. Cooperages, tanneries, salt mining and coal mining were some of the smaller industries in the area. The construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Western Maryland Railroad greatly accelerated the progress of the lumbering operations in Ohiopyle. Both railroads had stations in the borough. Several narrow gauge railroads were built up into the surrounding mountains. These smaller railways were able to efficiently transport lumber to the sawmills and rail stations of Ohiopyle. One of many walking trails. The railroads also brought tourists to Ohiopyle. The round trip ride from Pittsburgh to Ohiopyle was one dollar. Tourists flocked to the area to see the waterfalls and stay at the resorts that quickly sprouted up along the Youghiogheny River. The resorts had boardwalks, dancing pavilions, bowling alleys, fountains, tennis courts, and hiking trails. The rise of the automobile brought about the end of the resorts at Ohiopyle. The buildings were torn down and the forests were allowed to regrow. In 1963, Ohiopyle entered the current chapter of tourism. Wilderness Voyageurs, under the ownership of Lance Martin, began commercial whitewater rafting on the Youghiogheny River. This was the first commercial whitewater rafting company east of the Mississippi River. In 1963, 400 people experienced the rapids of the Lower Youghiogheny, in 2007 over 100,000 people came to \\"shoot the rapids\\" in rafts, kayaks, and canoes.

He visited in 1770 and said, \\"as fine a land as I have ever seen, a great deal of rich meadow; it is well watered and has a valuable mill seat.\\" The mill would eventually be completed in 1776. Once the mill was finished, it encouraged other business to come to the area to support and augment the business of the mill. Washington hoped to develop the remainder of Perryopolis, drawing up plans for the streets to be laid out in the shape of a wagon-wheel. Washington's estate sold the land after his death; in 1814 Perryopolis, previously known as \\"New Boston\\", was officially laid out using Washington's plans and named for Oliver Hazard Perry for his victory on Lake Erie during the War of 1812. In the late 19th century, the area around Perryopolis was first mined for coal.

Uniontown's role in the Underground Railroad in the antebellum years is commemorated by a marker on the corner of East Main Street and Baker Alley.\\"Underground Railroad\\", Historic Markers Database Residents helped slaves escaping from the South to freedom. In the late nineteenth century, the town grew based on the development of coal mines and the steel industry. Uniontown was the site of violent clashes between striking coal miners and guards at the local coke works during the bituminous coal miners' strike of 1894. Fifteen guards armed with carbines and machine guns held off an attack by 1,500 strikers, killing five and wounding eight.G. E. Plumbe, \\"The Great Coal Strike\\", The Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1895, Chicago Daily News, 1895; pp. 77-78 The Columbia Rolling Mill, an iron and steel works, was located in Uniontown from 1887 to 1895. The mill was the town's top industry at that time. During the Coal Boom of the early part of the 20th century, Uniontown was home to at least 13 millionaires, the most (per capita) of any city in the United States. \\"Coal barons\\" and Carl Laemmle, the president of Universal Films, sponsored the famous Uniontown Speedway board track from 1916 to 1922. It was a mile and a quarter raceway. As with most of Western Pennsylvania, Uniontown's economy waned during the region's deindustrialization of the late 20th century, when the steel industry restructured and many jobs went elsewhere, including offshore. This decline continued into the 21st century, and the population is about half its peak of 1940.

History Edward Cook's house A significant part of the prehistory of Washington Township is the Locus 7 Site, located north of Fayette City, where it is believed that members of the Monongahela tribe may have lived as far back as AD 600. Washington Township is an original Fayette County township, created from Rostraver Township when Fayette County was erected from Westmoreland County in 1783. It originally included Perry and Jefferson townships. Washington Township's most prominent historical figure is Colonel Edward Cook. Settling in what was then Westmoreland County, he was granted and first built a small log cabin and a small store. In 1772, he began building his home (still standing today), the first stone building west of the Allegheny Mountains. Built entirely out of limestone from his property, it was finished in 1776. Colonel Cook was among General Washington's personal friends and on two occasions at least entertained Washington in the old stone mansion. A local legend claims that on one of the occasions, Washington was journeying that way to visit his lands in Washington County and stopped at Col. Cook's for a brief rest. Cook was at that time engaged in reviewing a body of militia nearby and knew nothing of the arrival of his distinguished guest. Word of the arrival was whispered to the men before it reached the colonel, and when he observing the commotion learned what was in the wind, he relaxed all discipline and set off unceremoniously for the house. The militiamen followed at the double-quick and hurrahing enthusiastically for General Washington brought him to the porch and evoked from him in reply a good natured and fatherly speech which the soldiers cheered to the echo. There is no documented evidence, however, that this event occurred. After 1770, Washington visited southwestern Pennsylvania one last time, in September 1784. Washington kept an account of the journey that provides details of where he stopped each day, who he met with and what they talked about, in addition to specifically where he went, what he saw, and did. Each and every stop along the way is mentioned. In one passage he mentions traveling through or across Cook's land, but he makes no mention of stopping to talk to Cook or that he even saw him at any time during the 1784 journey. The second mention of Cook, later in his diary, mentions Cook had a large house, and again, nothing about stopping there, speaking to Cook, or there being a militia group present at any time during his time in SW Pennsylvania. Cook and Washington may have known each other however they shared very different viewpoints about the Virginia-Pennsylvania rivalry and counter claims over whether the region belonged to Virginia or Pennsylvania, and would have been rivals in the land acquisition and speculation business. Cook was a member of the Provincial Congress convened in Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia, June 18, 1776, that drafted the first declaration of independence presented to Congress, June 25, 1776, (see \\"Journal of Congress, vol. ii, p 230); was a member of the State Constitutional Convention that convened September 28, 1776; and was the first commissioner of exchange and appointed sub-lieutenant of Westmoreland County, March 21, 1777. On January 5, 1782, he was appointed lieutenant of Westmoreland County to succeed Col. Archibald Lochry, who had been captured and killed while on an Indian expedition. This office gave him command of the militia of the county and the management of its military fiscal affairs. It was from this appointment that Col. Cook received his military title. He aided in fixing the boundaries of Fayette County and was a member of the commission that located the county seat. On November 21, 1786, he was appointed justice of the peace with a jurisdiction that reached into Washington County. On April 8, 1789, he was appointed president of the Court of Common Pleas and Quarter Session. He was associate judge of Fayette County in 1791, and from 1796 to 1798 treasurer of Westmoreland County. He was conspicuous in the Whiskey Insurrection and having been prominent in some of the meetings of the insurgents, his arrest was ordered. Before any action could be taken, however, he appeared on November 6, 1794, before Thomas McKean, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and in the presence of William Bradford, Attorney General of the United States, voluntarily entered into recognizance to the United States for his appearance before the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States at the next special session of the Circuit Court held for the district of Pennsylvania \\"then and there to answer such charges of treasonable and seditious practices and such other matters of misdemeanor as shall be alleged against him in behalf of the United States and that he will not depart that court without license.\\" Having taken this bold and honorable course, he quietly awaited the result which was simply that nothing was found against him and he was not molested in person but some cavalrymen belonging to the army that came out to quell the insurrection visited his home and did considerable damage, nearly demolishing his distillery, knocking in the heads of liquor casks and spilling a vast amount of whiskey.Ellis, Franklin.

The population was 3,996 at the 2010 census. Greencastle lies within the Cumberland Valley of Pennsylvania. History James Patton, who came to America at age 17 and moved to North Carolina in 1793, started the settlement of Canogege (spelled \\"Conegoge\\" by George P. Donahoo). Patton said in an 1839 letter to his descendants that the place was \\"settled by a moral and orderly people.\\" Greencastle was founded in 1783 by John Allison from the Barkdoll House. The town was named after Greencastle, County Donegal, Ireland. It was originally composed of 246 lots. By 1790 there were about 60 houses in Greencastle, homes to approximately 400 people. The town of Greencastle had grown by the mid-nineteenth century to 1,125 residents. Latter Day Saint settlement In 1845, following the succession crisis in the Latter Day Saint movement, Sidney Rigdon (one of the three main contenders along with James Strang and Brigham Young for leadership of the Latter Day Saints following the death of Joseph Smith) took his followers to Pennsylvania and formed a Rigdonite Mormon settlement at Greencastle. This settlement had approximately 200 followers.Nead, Benjamin M. Birth-Place of Mormonism. Chambersburg, PA: Valley Spirit Press, 1897. http://sidneyrigdon.com/1869Moor.htm They founded the New Jerusalem settlement between Greencastle and Mercersburg, published the Conochoheague Herald newspaper in Greencastle,The Frontier Guardian, Vol. I No. 26, January 23, 1850. http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/LDS/ldsnews1.htm#012350 and made plans for the construction of a temple. The Rigdonite Mormon settlement at Greencastle only lasted a few years; some former Rigdon followers went to Utah to join Brigham Young, while William Bickerton, who had opposed Rigdon's move to Greencastle, would eventually reorganize the remaining Pennsylvania branch of the Latter Day Saint movement in Pittsburgh as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite). Civil War Early in the Civil War, Greencastle and neighboring Franklin County communities raised the 126th Pennsylvania Infantry. In the summer of 1863, the war touched close to home when Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia invaded southern Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign. From mid-June to early July, those residents of Greencastle who had not fled to safety lived under Confederate rule. On July 2, concurrent with the Battle of Gettysburg in neighboring Adams County, Captain Ulric Dahlgren's Federal cavalry patrol galloped into Greencastle's town square, where they surprised and captured several Confederate cavalrymen carrying vital correspondence from Richmond.Adapted from Jacob Hoke's book, The Great Invasion. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee's army began its retreat to Virginia on July 4 and 5. He sent John D. Imboden's cavalry to escort a large wagon train carrying Confederate wounded. The train, nearly in length, wound its way through the streets of Greencastle, where a few men of the town attacked the wagon train with axes and hatchets. They succeeded in disabling several wagons before Confederate cavalry chased them away. Modern era Following the war, Greencastle grew considerably in the late 19th century during the Industrial Revolution, having several industrial factories built inside the town limits, including the Crowell Manufacturing Company, which constructed farming equipment. In 1902, Greencastle businessman Philip Baer began a tradition where the town holds a triennial social event known as \\"Old Home Week\\". Every three years, Greencastle townspeople and former residents come together for one week in August in a town-wide reunion to reminisce and fellowship. The most recent Old Home Week Celebration occurred in 2019; the next one will be in 2021.All historical information drawn from one source -Conococheague: A History of the Greencastle-Antrim Community 1736-1971 by William Conrad.

The population was 5,935 at the 2010 census. It is the birthplace of both Baseball Hall of Fame member Nellie Fox, and United States Army brigadier general and legislator, Charles Thomas Campbell. History The Franklin Furnace Historic District, Chambersburg and Bedford Turnpike Road Company Toll House, and Woodland are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The account of the township's formation was lost when the Confederates burned the county seat Chambersburg in 1864, but according to the recollection of older citizens the township was organized ca. 1818 on territory taken from Peters and Hamilton townships. The area was settled in the 1740s by, among others, Col. John Armstrong, John Campbell, and John Dixon. There were several Campbell families among the early settlers, and an eighteenth-century map labels the village simply \\"Campbells\\". It was later called \\"Campbelltown\\", a designation that prevailed for many years until, at the suggestion of William Archibald, it received the official designation \\"St. Thomas\\", purportedly still honoring Thomas Campbell, who had laid out the village. The name \\"Saint Thomas\\" was reportedly a joke concerning Thomas Campbell's tendency to swear. The organization of the town appears to have been concurrent with the organization of the St. Thomas or \\"Campbeltown\\" Presbyterian Church in 1818. Not long afterwards local Evangelical Lutheran and German Reformed congregations joined the Presbyterians in the erection of a church building, which the three congregations shared from 1829 until 1854.Bates, Samuel P., History of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, Warner, Beers, 1887, p. 610.

When incorporated in 1831, the borough was given the name \\"Waynesboro.\\" It is one of several dozen towns, cities, and counties named after General Anthony Wayne, a hero of the American Revolutionary War. During the American Civil War, Waynesboro played a part in the Gettysburg Campaign in June and July 1863. In the week before the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate Major General Jubal Early's division of Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell's corps of the Army of Northern Virginia passed through the community on its way northward. After the battle, General Robert E. Lee rode through the border community with his retreating forces.

The population was 260 at the 2010 census, down from 295 at the 2000 census. Geography Greensboro is located in southeastern Greene County at (39.792911, -79.912087). It is situated on the west bank of the Monongahela River, opposite New Geneva and the mouth of George's Creek. It is bordered by Monongahela Township in Greene County to the north and west, and by Nicholson Township in Fayette County to the south and east, across the Monongahela. The county and township border follows the center of the river.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which are land and , or 26.06%, are water. History=The beginning of settlement Like much of the region, Greensboro can trace its roots back to Native American settlement, to the Mingo tribes of the Northern Iroquois. What was to later become Greensboro was first known to the Mingo as \\"Delight\\", so named in recognition of the rich farmland that stretched along the banks of the Monongahela River. As early as 1752, settlers from the east and south began to stake their claims in the lands along the Monongahela. The first white settler of Delight was explorer-trader John Badolet, who was a close friend of John Minor. Minor was the leader of the first group to settle in the area presently known as Mapletown, to the northwest of Greensboro in Monongahela Township. In the early 1780s Elias Stone bought Delight and divided it into blocks and streets; these still carry their original names. On February 9, 1790, Stone's growing village was named \\"Greensburgh\\" (later changed to \\"Greensboro\\") in honor of the Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, for whom Greene County was also named when it was formed from Washington County in 1796. Due to its advantageous geographic location along the river, it quickly became an early trading center for settlers and travelers heading north to Pittsburgh and to points West. Albert Gallatin, a partner in Albert Gallatin & Company and later the Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, purchased lots in Greensburgh in 1795. He also purchased a great deal of land in Fayette County, including what was to become later the town of New Geneva, directly across the river from Greensburgh. On a trip to Washington, D.C., Gallatin met a group of German glassblowers who were heading to Kentucky to form their own company. He urged them to consider settling in Greensburgh instead of Kentucky. With Gallatin's assistance, the group settled in nearby New Geneva and operated the New Geneva Glass Works there until about 1805. Around that time, Gallatin was appointed the Secretary of the Treasury and sold his interest in the glassworks to his partners. The remaining partners moved the operation across the river to the northern section of Greensburgh, which consequently took on the name of Glassworks. Early development Glassmaking was the primary industry for many Monongahela River towns, including the city of Pittsburgh as well as small towns such as New Geneva and Greensboro, for several decades preceding the Civil War. The late 18th-early 19th century New Geneva/Greensboro glassworks proved that quality glass, natural resources, and transportation networks could be effectively harnessed. After the Civil War, the manufacture of stoneware became Greensboro's leading industry, in addition to a prosperous clay tile manufacturer who specialized in roofing tiles. The mid 19th-century Greensboro stoneware potteries were among the most productive in the eastern United States. Talented artisans and craftsmen along with the excellent nearby clay banks produced a distinctive blue-gray stoneware which had a large market. Due to its location at the head of the slack waters of the Monongahela, Greensboro's influence as a commercial and manufacturing center expanded far beyond its small boundaries. By the 1850s, the slack water system of locks and dams had been developed by the Monongahela Navigation Company (later acquired by the Army Corps of Engineers), allowing for year-round travel from Pittsburgh to the Greensboro area. This permitted Greensboro to become a shipping point not only for southern Greene County but for parts of what is now northern West Virginia as well. Its growing industrial, commercial, and transportation significance in the mid-19th century helped transform the town into a social and cultural center. In the 1880s, Greensboro essentially lost the pottery and clay tile market due to more efficient producers, and with the extension of slack water transportation to Morgantown became a more localized port. During this period, many of the present churches in the community were established, with the Greensburgh Lutheran Church forming first. Other churches soon followed, such as the Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, and eventually, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. As was the tradition for early churches, particularly Protestants, most of these groups began meeting for worship in a member's home, or during fair weather outside under large tents, with \\"circuit riders\\" as pastors until formal church structures could be built and an established clergy formed. The industrial era and today Around the start of the 20th century came industrialization, and Western Pennsylvania's role was vital in the transformation of the national economy. A part of the Klondike coal seam, which extends through most of eastern Greene County and western Fayette County, the Greensboro area was rich in the mineral that made the region famous around the world. Greensboro, being a community already established with the conveniences, commerce and trade, suddenly found itself as a growing cultural and economic hub for many growing \\"coal patch towns\\" sprouting up in the area during the area Coal Rush. Coal became King, and with Western Pennsylvania as his capital, it was only logical that Greensboro became part of this movement. Indeed, the Penn-Pitt neighborhood was originally company housing for miners, as were the nearby Seventh Pool and Poland Mines areas, and countless others, many of which are lost to history today. Thousands of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe flooded into the region and brought with them new customs, traditions, and culture. Coal also became Ruler. History has shown that any growth industry using thousands of underskilled, undereducated immigrant workers provides fertile ground for the lust of greed and opportunism. Many mines and their owners sought to capitalize on this and found ways to maximize their profits. As such, many workers found themselves \\"selling their soul to the company store\\", earning meager pay for a dangerous day's wage, only to be spent on company goods and rent in the patch towns created by these very companies, effectively making these workers willful individuals of \\"wage slavery\\". During this period the formation of unions such as the UMWA became more prevalent and necessary to represent the workers. Through the growth of the UMWA and events such as the \\"Red Neck Revolution of 1921\\" an era of wage slavery began to end. At one point, the Greensboro area was famous for the Robena mine, known as the largest mine in the world at the peak of its production in 1946. Robena also became famous for a more tragic reason: in December 1962 37 miners died in an explosion at Robena No. 3, illustrating how precarious this work truly was. Coal defined the region and the lives of those who inhabited it, and made not only Greensboro and the Monongahela Valley prosperous, but the nation as well. Yet this period was not to last, and as the coal seams became tapped out and the processes outdated and replaced with modern mechanical technology, communities like Penn-Pitt and Poland Mines began to fade as their reason for existence ceased. While coal (followed by healthcare) currently remains the backbone for much of the economy of Greene County, Greensboro and other communities have been migrating away from such dependency and see benefits in non-industrial sources of employment in sectors such as ecotourism, agritourism, and community-supported agriculture (CSAs), as well as fishing, hunting, hiking and boating. Historic industries=Pottery Early in the town's history, pottery became an important part of Greensboro's economic base, with the first operation owned and operated by Alexander Vance. Vance settled in Greensboro in the early 19th century, while still very young, and began a small pottery trade operation with his brother James. The stoneware was manufactured from local red clay and had a very distinctive coloring. The Vances eventually began to expand their operations, bringing in David Boughner, who took over the business in 1819 when the Vances left for Ohio. Boughner was the first operator to fire the stoneware in a salt kiln. Although Boughner's operation may have been among the earliest and most advanced stoneware operation in the area, it was by no means the only one. James and William \\"Leet\\" Hamilton arrived from New Brighton, Pennsylvania, in 1850 and started a pottery manufacturing company of their own. The remains of their endeavors, which operated under the name James Hamilton and Company, can still be found along Water Street. The original James Hamilton and Company did not last long, however, and in 1866 was sold to Leet's son Frank and a son-in-law named John Jones. Together Frank Hamilton and Jones expanded the business and began selling their wares on a grander scale. Hamilton and Jones was located on Diamond Street and for many years was the only rival to the cross-town operation of James Hamilton. The company was also known as Star Pottery for a period of time, as well as the Union Works. The business continued to produce pottery for over thirty years and its reputation was widespread, although it never actually surpassed its rival in production. Eventually competition began to wear away at the profitability of the company, with a devastating fire in 1897 destroying the plant and forcing operations closed. Although the company attempted to move into the Williams and Reppert plant across town, efforts to start anew were futile. James Hamilton remained in control of his firm until 1880. A share of the business had been sold in 1866, but he continued to hold the majority interest for the next fourteen years until he sold out completely to Thomas Reppert and W.T. Williams. In 1884, Reppert purchased the entire business from Williams, making himself the sole proprietor. Williams was able to buy back into the business once again in 1890. Together Reppert and Williams manufactured stoneware for dealers in at least four states. However, by the beginning of World War I, all significant production had ended and 1916 generally marks the end of stoneware manufacturing in Greensboro. Glass Albert Gallatin and several of his partners in Albert Gallatin & Co. founded the \\"glassworks district\\" with the help of German glassblowers Christian Kramer, Boltzer Kramer, John Gabler, Adolf Eberhart, Lewis Reitz and George Reppert. Gallatin first met the glassblowers in 1792 at Tomlinson's Tavern in the mountains of Maryland. The glassworkers had left the recently closed Amelung Works of Frederick, Maryland, and were planning on migrating to Mays Landing, Kentucky, to set up a new glass factory. Gallatin reputedly persuaded them to establish a glassworks on his land in New Geneva. The glassblowers went to see both New Geneva and the Mays Landing site. When notes were finally compared New Geneva was chosen. After much discussion, a co-partnership was entered into between Gallatin and James A. Nicholson on the one hand and the German glassblowers on the other. This partnership lasted until 1803, during which time the New Geneva Glass Works produced window glass for the early pioneers as well as bottles, bowls, and other items. Following his appointment to the cabinet, Gallatin determined to withdraw from the glass firm and advertised on May 7, 1803, in The Tree of Liberty (a Pittsburgh newspaper), \\"Sale by Auction...One undivided half of the New Geneva Glassworks, a ferry across the Monongahela River, sundry lots and dwelling houses in the town of Greensboro.. .\\" The Germans continued operations at New Geneva until 1807, when they moved the works to present-day glassworks near Greensboro because of the discovery of an outcrop of coal at that place. The use of coal instead of the wood used at New Geneva greatly facilitated glass production, and its great abundance at Greensboro along with the nearby sand deposits supplied the works with most of the necessary raw materials until they closed in 1849. Managed by the Kramers and operated by the Kramers and the other German families, the old glassworks produced window glass, with individual glassworkers blowing bottles, bowls and ornaments as gifts for family and friends. All of them worked for wages, dividing the profits at year's end. Glass was loaded on barges from the special wharves built behind the works and shipped up and down the Monongahela, supplying the early settlers with what was once a luxury west of the Alleghenies, glass windows. Current preservation and revitalization efforts Greensboro is a municipality that realizes the importance of keeping its past alive through the generations. Residents, elected officials, and community groups regularly work together to educate, promote, and conserve the rich history of this small rural community. In order to do this, both public and private partnerships have been established to meet the community's diverse needs. The many historical and conservation projects completed by the Greensboro community exemplify the fostering of private and public partnerships in a rural community. To date, over $3 million has been invested in projects that preserve and protect the history of this community. Dating back to 1985 which coincidentally was the year of the 1985 Election day floods, the community identified the need to begin documenting their history. This began by first establishing the Historic District that now surrounds and protects much of the community. In 1987, Greensboro native Betty Longo began to record, in longhand, the memories of Mary Black Carr, an elderly resident of the community. These memoirs have proven to be a strong historical thread of the community. Beginning with these early acts of preservation, Greensboro has worked collectively to maintain its heritage by using all resources available. In 1987, the residents formed a Citizen's Advisory Planning Committee to deal with the changes coming because of the dismantling of Lock #7. In building these partnerships, success has been achieved through the dedication of a handful of hard-working residents. Most recently, the Nathanael Greene Historical Foundation with support from Borough Council has been the organizer of historical preservation efforts. In specific instances such as the preservation of the Log House, a partnership was first formed with the Army Corps of Engineering to relocate and restore the log cabin home. A partnership was also formed with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry's Civilian Conservation Corps to provide the labor needed to perform the restoration work on the building. These partnerships proved vital to the success of reopening the Log House not only as an historical building within the community, but also as a meeting facility that is available for community use. The efforts of this community prevented the destruction of this valuable historic asset, which now provides a location for the annual community Christmas Party and can be rented out for private functions. The nominal fees associated with renting the Log House help to provide additional revenue for the municipality. Other projects include the preparation of a Historic District Homeowners Manual, the establishment of a municipal website that provides a summary of Greensboro history, the use of grant funds to build a boat launch, and the refurbishing of 28 homes using state funds. In addition, community festivals that display many of the historical artifacts are conducted yearly, and a comprehensive plan is underway with five neighboring municipalities. This community continues to strive to preserve their history and to educate their residents about their past while working to improve their future. Historic District The Greensboro Historic District was established in 1995 and is roughly bounded by County, Second, Walnut, Front and Clear streets and the Monongahela River. The Greensboro Historic District is a defined area of with a concentration of buildings, structures, and sites that contribute to the significance of the Borough in terms of its importance in industry, commerce, architecture, archeology, and transportation. While the district's industrial and transportation significance are largely contained in the 19th century, its commercial and architectural significance extend into the early 20th century. Five other buildings within the borough outside the historic district boundaries are also included as having historical significance. Note: This includes Within the Greensboro Historic District boundaries are 36 buildings, 29 of these are considered contributing. The wharf, built around the time of the Civil War, is also located within the District, as well as an archaeological site containing the location of the James and Hamilton Company pottery works. The historic significance of the district is its architecture, which is representative of local vernacular architecture and displays elements of various popular styles ranging from the Italianate of the early 19th century to the Bungalow style of the early 20th century. Many dwellings are of the Queen Anne style. Few, if any, southwestern Pennsylvania towns can boast the range of architecture from its period of settlement to the 20th century as can be found in Greensboro. The period of significance for the district is 1750 to 1949. The structures contain a mix of commercial business, religious uses, a theater, and residential dwellings. In addition to the Greensboro Historic District, the Greensboro Public School, Alexander V. Boughner House, Peters-Graham House, James Parreco House, and James Jones House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was founded as a company town around the workings of a Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company owned and operated coal mine in 1917.

History in brief Buckeye Coal Company, 1946 The land upriver from Brownsville along the eastern border of Greene County was acquired by the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. (YS&T;) which planned, zoned, populated, and built the community, complete with a movie theater, tennis courts, amusement hall (in the fashion of the times in blue-collar company towns, part pool hall, part beer garden), and swimming pool near the borough of Carmichaels. At one time, Youngstown Sheet and Tube was the largest steel company in the nation.Wikipedia article: Youngstown Sheet and Tube Establishing the town well after the United Mine Workers flexed their muscles in the strikes of the 1890s‚Äì1900s and after its riot troubles in Youngstown in 1916, it is also likely the company had a hand in establishing the local school and one or more churches and likely issued invitations and recruited the medical practitioners operating the various health clinics.The pleasant amenities might also have been a result of the 1916 riots the company experienced in its East Youngstown plant. The mine, established outside the town, was one of many large mines atop the Pittsburgh Coal Seam on the west bank of the Monongahela River. It was operated as a subsidiary under the Buckeye Coal Company and grew and benefited as being directly on the railroad route running upriver (south) to West Virginia and was able to load both river coal barges and freight trains with its output. It is thought by some to have been the largest coal mine in the United States in 1919, and was rated at being the second most productive in Greene County in the 1940s war years.

History Rices Landing is a small rural town located along the western bank of the Monongahela River, approximately south of Pittsburgh. One of the first visitors to the area was George Washington. Tale has it that in 1775, while he was traveling to Fort Duquesne, he and his men camped in this area, just across from Pumpkin Run on the other side of the river after he crossed. In 1786, John Rice purchased land on the east side of Enoch's Run, and at about the same time, Abijah McClain purchased land on the west side. John Rice named the community he built \\"Rices Landing\\", while Abijah McClain called his settlement \\"Newport\\". In 1801, Benjamin Franklin mapped out the area and combined the two communities under the name \\"Rices Landing\\". Enoch's Run was renamed \\"Swan Run\\" before it eventually took the name it holds today, Pumpkin Run. Rices Landing officially incorporated in April 1903. The availability of valuable resources such as trees, clay, sand, coal and transportation allowed the community to thrive. Shops, trading posts, taverns, and other businesses once lined its busy streets. It was so prosperous that it was regarded as the \\"Gateway to Western Pennsylvania\\" by frontier settlers. Although things have quieted today, the residents still see their community as a charming and respectable community that was once the talk of the frontier world.From the Rices Landing Centennial Celebration guide, 2003 Rices Landing is the former home of US Olympic wrestler and four-time state champion Cary Kolat. Kolat attended Jefferson Morgan High School. He is known as being one of the best wrestlers in history, going 137-0 in high school and 111-7 in college. Kolat won many international medals and competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. View from the Green River Trail Established in 1903, Rices Landing is a town rich in tradition. The center of industry in Rices Landing during the First and Second World Wars was the W. A. Young and Sons Foundry and Machine Shop, which is still in existence. The foundry was used to make many different items for the war effort and will undergo construction in the coming year. The town was in the heart of the steel industry, with many coal mines located in and around the town. Many of these mines and industry are no longer around. Rices Landing is home to Pumpkin Run Park, which is owned and maintained by the borough. The park opens on Memorial Day and closes on Labor Day. Located in the downtown area is the Greene River Bike and Walking Trail, which is a continuing project that reaches from Fredericktown to Crucible. The Rice's Landing Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Government Rices Landing's local government is made up of five council members and the mayor of the town. Council members William Kozich (President) and Thomas Teegarden. Education Rices Landing is a part of the Jefferson-Morgan School District, which is located on 1334 Jefferson Road in Jefferson. The small, rural school offers one-on-one experience between students and teachers. Jefferson-Morgan consists of two schools: an elementary school ranging from grades K-6, and a middle and high school combined. The school colors are orange and black. In 2005, Jefferson-Morgan launched the campaign, \\"Classrooms for the future,\\" which focuses on bringing technology to the classroom. The campaign allows teachers to use technology as a teaching tool to better prepare students for the real world.

Its population was 4,176 at the 2010 census. The region around Waynesburg is underlaid with several layers of coking coal, including the Pittsburgh No. 8 seam, the Waynesburg seam, and the Sewickley (Mapletown) seam. The area is also rich with coalbed methane, which is being developed from the underlying Marcellus Shale, the largest domestic natural gas reserve. Early in the 20th century, four large gas compressing stations and a steam shovel factory were located in Waynesburg. Waynesburg is named for General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne, one of the top lieutenants of George Washington during the Revolutionary War (1776‚Äì81). The borough is the location of Waynesburg University, and it is served by the Greene County Airport. History Waynesburg c. 1865, showing the Union School (upper left) and the Old Cumberland Presbyterian Church (upper right) In 1796, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation to create Greene County, dividing Washington County into two parts with the lower part becoming Greene County. Part of the legislation required a city to take the county seat for the section of land. They chose Waynesburg as the place for the county seat because it was in the center of the county. Thomas Slater owned the land which is now Waynesburg. According to the Living Places website, Slater purchased the land from a Native American for a two-year-old heifer and a flint-lock rifle. In that time, land development required a patent from William Penn. The town at that time was referred to as Eden, named after his wife Elanor‚Äôs maiden name, according to the Angel Fire website. County commissioners bought the 158 acres of land from Slater for $2,376 for the purpose of building a jail, courthouse and other public buildings. The commissioners changed the name to Waynesburg, after Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne. Despite selling the land, though, Slater remained in the area. He lived next to the Waynesburg VFW where two trailers now sit. Slater lived in his house until his death in 1815 at the age of 76. In August 1875 construction began of the narrow gauge Waynesburg and Washington Railroad, conceived by John Day in 1874 and chartered in 1875. Its passenger service ended in 1929, and conversion to followed in 1944 as a wartime measure. Then the railroad was renamed the Waynesburg Secondary Railroad. Regular freight service ended on this line in 1976, though part of it still serves (irregularly) for railroad access to a coal mine.

The use of government revenues and expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed as a result of the Great Depression, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unpopular. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose Keynesian economics theorized that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influences aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country's government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation (which is considered \\"healthy\\" at the level in the range 2%‚Äì3%) and to increase employment. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%‚Äì3% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%‚Äì5%. This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilize the economy over the course of the business cycle. Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including: * aggregate demand and the level of economic activity * saving and investment * income distribution * allocation of resources. Fiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy, in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply, interest rates and is often administered by a country's central bank. Both fiscal and monetary policies influence a country's economic performance.  Monetary or fiscal policy?  Since the 1970s, it became clear that monetary policy performance has some benefits over fiscal policy due to the fact that it reduces political influence, as it is set by the central bank (to have an expanding economy before the general election, politicians might cut the interest rates). Additionally, fiscal policy can potentially have more supply-side effects on the economy: to reduce inflation, the measures of increasing taxes and lowering spending would not be preferred, so the government might be reluctant to use these. Monetary policy is generally quicker to implement as interest rates can be set every month, while the decision to increase government spending might take time to figure out which area the money should be spent on. The recession of the 2000s decade shows that monetary policy also has certain limitations. A liquidity trap occurs when interest rate cuts are insufficient as a demand booster as banks do not want to lend and the consumers are reluctant to increase spending due to negative expectations for the economy. Government spending is responsible for creating the demand in the economy and can provide a kick-start to get the economy out of the recession. When a deep recession takes place, it is not sufficient to rely just on monetary policy to restore the economic equilibrium. Each side of these two policies has its differences, therefore, combining aspects of both policies to deal with economic problems has become a solution that is now used by the US. These policies have limited effects; however, fiscal policy seems to have a greater effect over the long-run period, while monetary policy tends to have a short-run success. In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association (AEA) found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \\"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \\"Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\\" In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed. Stances Depending on the state of the economy, fiscal policy may reach for different objectives: its focus can be to restrict economic growth by mediating inflation or, in turn, increase economic growth by decreasing taxes, encouraging spending on different projects that act as stimuli to economic growth and enabling borrowing and spending. The three stances of fiscal policy are the following: * Neutral fiscal policy is usually undertaken when an economy is in neither a recession nor an expansion. The amount of government deficit spending (the excess not financed by tax revenue) is roughly the same as it has been on average over time, so no changes to it are occurring that would have an effect on the level of economic activity. * Expansionary fiscal policy is used by the government when trying to balance the contraction phase in the business cycle. It involves government spending exceeding tax revenue by more than it has tended to, and is usually undertaken during recessions. Examples of expansionary fiscal policy measures include increased government spending on public works (e.g., building schools) and providing the residents of the economy with tax cuts to increase their purchasing power (in order to fix a decrease in the demand). * Contractionary fiscal policy, on the other hand, is a measure to increase tax rates and decrease government spending. It occurs when government deficit spending is lower than usual. This has the potential to slow economic growth if inflation, which was caused by a significant increase in aggregate demand and the supply of money, is excessive. By reducing the economy's amount of aggregate income, the available amount for consumers to spend is also reduced. So, contractionary fiscal policy measures are employed when unsustainable growth takes place, leading to inflation, high prices of investment, recession and unemployment above the \\"healthy\\" level of 3%‚Äì4%. However, these definitions can be misleading because, even with no changes in spending or tax laws at all, cyclic fluctuations of the economy cause cyclic fluctuations of tax revenues and of some types of government spending, altering the deficit situation; these are not considered to be policy changes. Therefore, for purposes of the above definitions, \\"government spending\\" and \\"tax revenue\\" are normally replaced by \\"cyclically adjusted government spending\\" and \\"cyclically adjusted tax revenue\\". Thus, for example, a government budget that is balanced over the course of the business cycle is considered to represent a neutral and effective fiscal policy stance. Methods of fiscal policy funding Governments spend money on a wide variety of things, from the military and police to services such as education and health care, as well as transfer payments such as welfare benefits. This expenditure can be funded in a number of different ways: * Taxation * Seigniorage, the benefit from printing money * Borrowing money from the population or from abroad * Dipping into fiscal reserves * Sale of fixed assets (e.g., land)  Borrowing  A fiscal deficit is often funded by issuing bonds, such as Treasury bills or consols and gilt-edged securities. These pay interest, either for a fixed period or indefinitely. If the interest and capital requirements are too large, a nation may default on its debts, usually to foreign creditors. Public debt or borrowing refers to the government borrowing from the public.  Dipping into prior surpluses  A fiscal surplus is often saved for future use, and may be invested in either local currency or any financial instrument that may be traded later once resources are needed and the additional debt is not needed.  Fiscal straitjacket  The concept of a fiscal straitjacket is a general economic principle that suggests strict constraints on government spending and public sector borrowing, to limit or regulate the budget deficit over a time period. Most US states have balanced budget rules that prevent them from running a deficit. The United States federal government technically has a legal cap on the total amount of money it can borrow, but it is not a meaningful constraint because the cap can be raised as easily as spending can be authorized, and the cap is almost always raised before the debt gets that high. Economic effects Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved: *Price stability; *Full employment; *Economic growth. The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand, stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place. Additionally, Keynesians argue that expansionary fiscal policy should be used in times of recession or low economic activity as an essential tool for building the framework for strong economic growth and working towards full employment. In theory, the resulting deficits would be paid for by an expanded economy during the expansion that would follow; this was the reasoning behind the New Deal. Governments can use a budget surplus to do two things: *to slow the pace of strong economic growth; *to stabilize prices when inflation is too high. Keynesian theory posits that removing spending from the economy will reduce levels of aggregate demand and contract the economy, thus stabilizing prices. But economists still debate the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. The argument mostly centers on crowding out: whether government borrowing leads to higher interest rates that may offset the stimulative impact of spending. When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt. When governments fund a deficit with the issuing of government bonds, interest rates can increase across the market, because government borrowing creates higher demand for credit in the financial markets. This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services, either partially or entirely offsetting the direct expansionary impact of the deficit spending, thus diminishing or eliminating the achievement of the objective of a fiscal stimulus. Neoclassical economists generally emphasize crowding out while Keynesians argue that fiscal policy can still be effective, especially in a liquidity trap where, they argue, crowding out is minimal. In the classical view, expansionary fiscal policy also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer a higher rate of return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. The increased demand, in turn, causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports. Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved. Further, the outside lag between the time of implementation and the time that most of the effects of the stimulus are felt could mean that the stimulus hits an already-recovering economy and overheats the ensuing h rather than stimulating the economy when it needs it. Some economists are concerned about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that would have otherwise been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have been unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation.

It is in the caldera of the Taupo Volcano. With a surface area of , it is the largest lake by surface area in New Zealand, and the second largest freshwater lake by surface area in geopolitical Oceania after Lake Murray in Papua New Guinea. Motutaiko Island lies in the south east area of the lake. Lake Taupo has a perimeter of approximately 193 kilometres and a maximum depth of 186 metres. It is drained by the Waikato River (New Zealand's longest river), and its main tributaries are the Waitahanui River, the Tongariro River, and the Tauranga Taupo River. It is a noted trout fishery with stocks of introduced brown and rainbow trout. The level of the lake is controlled by Mercury Energy, using gates built in 1940-41. They are used to reduce flooding, conserve water and ensure a minimum flow of in the Waikato River. The resource consent allows the level of the lake to be varied between 357.25 and above sea level.  Lake formation and volcanism  Lake Taupo is in a caldera created by a supervolcanic eruption which occurred approximately 26,500 years ago. According to geological records, the volcano has erupted 28 times in the last 27,000 years. It has ejected mostly rhyolitic lava, although Mount Tauhara formed from dacitic lava. Taupo has been active for 300,000 years with a very large event known as the Oruanui eruption occurring 26,500 years ago. It was the world's largest known eruption over the past 70,000 years, ejecting 1170 cubic kilometres of material and causing several hundred square kilometres of surrounding land to collapse and form the caldera. The caldera later filled with water to form Lake Taupo, eventually overflowing to cause a huge outburst flood. Several later eruptions occurred over the millennia before the most recent major eruption, which is traditionally dated as about 181 CE from Greenland ice-core records. Tree ring data from two studies suggests a later date of 232 CE ¬± 5. Known as the Hatepe eruption, it is believed to have ejected 100 cubic kilometres of material, of which 30 cubic kilometres was ejected in a few minutes. This was one of the most violent eruptions in the last 5000 years (alongside the Minoan eruption in the 2nd millennium BCE, the Tianchi eruption of Baekdu around 1000 CE and the 1815 eruption of Tambora), with a Volcanic Explosivity Index rating of 7; and there appears to be a correlation, to within a few years, of a year in which the sky was red over Rome and China. The eruption devastated much of the North Island and further expanded the lake. The area was uninhabited by humans at the time of the eruption since New Zealand was not settled by the MƒÅori until about 1280. Possible climatic effects of the eruption would have been concentrated on the southern hemisphere due to the southerly position of Lake Taupo.Climate, History and the Modern World, Lamb, H. (1995), Routledge Taupo's last known eruption occurred around 30 years later, with lava dome extrusion forming the Horomatangi Reefs, but that eruption was much smaller than the 180 CE eruption. Wharf and small jetty on Lake Taupo where the Waikato River departs, 1928 Underwater hydrothermal activity continues near the Horomatangi vent, and nearby geothermal fields with associated hot springs are found north and south of the lake, for example at Rotokawa and Turangi. These springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Extremophile. eds. E.Monosson and C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC The volcano is currently considered to be dormant rather than extinct because of moderate fumarole activity and hot springs along the shores of the lake.  Biota  Lake Taupo Much of the watershed of Lake Taupo is a beech and podocarp forest with associate understory ferns being Blechnum filiforme, Asplenium flaccidum, Doodia media, Hymenophyllum demissum, Microsorum pustulatum and Dendroconche scandens, and some prominent associate shrubs being Olearia ranii and Alseuosmia quercifolia.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Native faunal species in the lake include northern koura or crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons) and kokopu or whitebait (Galaxias species). The lake is noted for stocks of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), introduced from Europe and California respectively in the late nineteenth century. There has also been a subsequent introduction of smelt (Retropinnidae species) as a food for the trout. A community of sponges and associated invertebrates live around the underwater geothermal vents.  Tourism  NASA satellite photo of Lake Taupo Tourism is a major component of Taupo's commercial sector. The busiest time for the industry is the high summer season around Christmas and New Year. The lake area has a temperate climate. Daily maximum temperatures recorded for Taupo range from an average of 23.3 ¬∞C in January and February to 11.2 ¬∞C in July, while the nighttime minimum temperatures range from 11.6 ¬∞C in February down to 2.2 ¬∞C in July. Rain falls in all seasons but is greatest in winter and spring, from June to December. Taupo hosts the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge, a cycling tour around the lake which can take anywhere between four and ten hours. Hundreds of volunteers from the Taupo township are involved in the event. Skydiving is a popular local sport and tourist attraction. Taupo also hosts the Kellogg's Ironman event. Crossing the 40.2 km length of the lake is a challenge for open-water swimmers. In 2020, Michael Wells from Darwin, Australia, was the first to breaststroke across the lake. MƒÅori rock carving MƒÅori rock carvings at Mine Bay on Lake Taupo are over 10 metres high and accessible only by boat or kayak. On the north-west side of Lake Taupo on the cliffs of Mine Bay, there are MƒÅori rock carvings created in the late 1970s by Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell and John Randall. Carved in the likeness of Ngatoroirangi, a navigator who guided the Tuwharetoa and Te Arawa tribes to the Taupo area over a thousand years ago according to MƒÅori legend. The 10-metre-high carving is intended to protect Lake Taupo from volcanic activities underneath. The cliff has become a popular tourist destination with hundreds of boats and yachts visiting the spot yearly. MƒÅori tribes Lake Taupo is a taonga (treasure or something special to the person) of Ngati Tuwharetoa from the Te Arawa waka. Ngati Tuwharetoa still owns the bed of the lake and its tributaries. They grant the public free access for recreational use.

During the land purchase of 1755 James Sterrat of Carlisle purchased 400 acres including the sleeping place called John Hart's log on the Juniata River, which is now Alexandria. Some time in the years before 1785 the first mention of a religious group called Hartslog Presbyterian Congregation was formed. A log worship house, Old Hartslog Church, stood upon the hill one mile (1.6 km) north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, where a burial ground was later made. This was a primitive structure but by 1787 a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In 1794 it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews. In 1826, the old Hartslog congregation moved to a brick building, referred to by Senator John Scott in his memoirs as the \\"Brick Church\\", which seems to have been located near to the site of the present Reformed Church. The old log worship house was taken down the same year, and some of its logs were used in one or two of the dwellings of Alexandria. In the late 18th century the primary transportation to and from Alexandria was the Juniata River, suitable only during summer and when the water depth permitted. On May 3, 1808, the new road from Harrisburg to Alexandria opened, permitting a more reliable connection with the outside world. In 1833 the Juniata Division of the Pennsylvania Canal was opened, the promise of better transportation started a mini housing boom in Alexandria. By 1875 the canal was abandoned and the Pennsylvania Railroad managed the transportation needs of the area. Around this time the growth of the area slowed, while the populations of Huntingdon and Hollidaysburg grew. Alexandria RR Station, Pennsylvania.jpg Old railway station Hartslog Heritage Day Festival Alexandria hosts the annual \\"Hartslog Heritage Day\\" celebration each year on the second Saturday of October. The day-long event recognizes the early days of the small borough, when, in 1744, a licensed Indian trader named John Hart used a large hollowed-out log to feed and salt his horses while he conducted his trading. Early settlers used this log as a landmark to describe the location of their claims and referred to this area as Hartslog Settlement. In 1793 this area was laid out into town lots and named Alexandria, with the street near the site of the log name Hartslog Street. Today the name remains for Hartslog Street as well as the region ‚Äî \\"Hartslog Valley.\\" The Hartslog Museum located on the second floor of the library in Alexandria is open one weekend a month and on Hartslog Day. The museum includes artifacts and antiques from the area, when Pennsylvania was still inhabited by Indian tribes. Hartslog Day helps to support the museum.

With a population of 7,093 at the 2010 census, it is the largest population center near Raystown Lake, a winding, flood-control reservoir managed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. The borough is located on the main line of the Norfolk Southern (formerly Pennsylvania) Railway, in an agricultural and outdoor recreational region with extensive forests and scattered deposits of ganister rock, coal, fire clay, and limestone. Historically, the region surrounding Huntingdon was dotted with iron furnaces and forges, consuming limestone, iron ore and wood (for charcoal production) throughout the 19th century. Dairy farms dominate the local agriculture. The town is a regular stop for the Amtrak passenger service which connects Harrisburg with Pittsburgh. Huntingdon is home to Juniata College, a private liberal arts college founded by members of the Church of the Brethren in 1876. History In 1768, Rev. Dr. William Smith began selling lots on the Standing Stone Tract along the Juniata, land he had recently acquired. The tract's two prior owners had not attempted to lay out a town, so Dr. Smith is considered the founder. Huntingdon (the name by which he eventually called his town) sits at the site of corn fields that had been cultivated at a date now unknown, next to where Standing Stone Creek flows into the Juniata River. The 100th anniversary of its incorporation was marked by the erection of a \\"Standing Stone Monument\\" on Third Street, modeled on a tall, narrow shaft known to have existed before 1750, whose purpose is unclear but may have served as a trail marker. It may be significant that natural sandstone formations (popularly called Pulpit Rocks), which \\"stand erect\\", are on a nearby ridge. A story surfaced during the early 19th century that Smith had renamed Standing Stone Settlement to honor an Englishwoman, Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. Smith's descendants vehemently denied the story, and there exists no evidence to support it, despite a wide circulation in published sources. More likely, the Anglican cleric named it after the town of the same name in England; doing so had become a pattern for naming Pennsylvania settlements, Bedford, Carlisle and York being nearby examples of the trend. In 1796, the little village was incorporated as a borough. Huntingdon long served as the junction of the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and as an important port on the Main Line of Public Works of the Pennsylvania Canal. In past years, Huntingdon boasted of manufacturers of flour, heavy machinery, radiators, furniture, stationery, woolen goods, shirts, shoes, electronic components, finished lumber, fiberglass yarn, matting and underground storage tanks. In the 19th century, J. C. Blair, a native of Shade Gap and a stationer and businessman, popularized the writing tablet and began marketing it nationwide. His factory in downtown Huntingdon was later relocated to nearby Alexandria. The vicinity (but not much of the town proper) has been the subject of repeated flooding, in 1889, in 1936, and again in 1972. More recently in 2004, Hurricane Ivan resulted in major flooding close to Huntingdon, the worst since the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the region in July 1972. The Huntingdon Borough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

In the vicinity are found bituminous coal, ganister rock, fire clay, and some timber. A major Easter grass factory is located in the northern quadrant of the borough limits; until May 2007, the facility was owned by Bleyer Industries. The population was 2,447 at the 2010 census. History Mount Union was largely influenced by industry. It was at one time the world's largest producer of refractory material (silica brick), with three plants ‚Äì General Refractories, United States Refractories, and Harbison Walker. The refractory business in Mount Union lasted from 1899 to about 1972, with limited production into the early 1990s. Other industries included two tanneries, a tanning extract plant, coal yards, an explosives and munitions plant (Aetna), and foundry and machine shops. Mount Union was the northern terminus for the narrow gauge East Broad Top Railroad, connecting to the Main Line of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Norfolk Southern). The EBT maintained a large dual-gauge yard and coal cleaning plant in Mount Union and supplied coal to the Refractory plants. The EBT ceased operations in 1956 but the track is still in place and owned by the railroad. From 1998 to 2010, the Mount Union Connecting Railroad attempted to reactivate the EBT main track through Mount Union and rehabilitated it, but only a couple cars were serviced and none moved over the EBT trackage. The Mount Union Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, with 300 significant historic structures, buildings, and homes. The population tally in 1900 was 1,086 which rose to 3,338 in 1910. Today The culturally significant Thousand Steps of the Standing Stone Trail are located in the Jacks Narrows about 2 miles west of the town along U.S. Route 22. The annual Creation Festival is hosted locally (since 1984), drawing thousands of visitors in late June.

History The narrow-gauge East Broad Top Railroad was constructed through the community in 1873. Rockhill was selected as the location of the railroad's maintenance facility. The parent company Rockhill Iron and Coal located their dual-stack coke-fired iron furnace here. Rockhill as it exists today was created by the coal company and the railroad as a support community for their infrastructure. The iron furnace shut down for the last time in 1907, and the railroad became the primary employer. The EBT shut down in 1956, but a portion from Rockhill north to Shirleysburg was reactivated in 1960 as a tourist operation. In the late 2000s the track to the south was rehabilitated to PA 475 sufficiently for speeders to operate and give rides to the public. Friends of the East Broad Top, Inc. have been working to provide rehabilitation to the facilities in Rockhill. Tours inside the East Broad Top shop complex are offered during the summer months.http://www.febt.org Points of interest * Rockhill Trolley Museum * East Broad Top Railroad ReferencesExternal links * Friends of the East Broad Top, Inc.

The population was 346 at the 2010 census. History Saltillo was named after the Mexican War Battle of Saltillo (23 October 1840). It was a major tanning center during the late 19th andearly20th centuries. The Leas and McVitty Tannery was located here, known for quality hides. The main line of the East Broad Top Railroad (EBT) was built through Saltillo in 1874. The railroad served the tannery as well as a short-lived iron mine and an equally short- lived limestone quarry, both just southeast of town. Saltillo was an important place on the EBT, acting as a base station for the long grade up to Broad Top Mountain. The EBT had a three-track yard, a station, a water tank and a turning wye located here. Just after the turn of the 20th century a large Ganister quarry was established above Saltillo on Jacks Mountain by Mount Union Refractories (later United States Refractories and North American Refractories) to supply their plant in Mount Union, Pennsylvania. In 1942 a spur was built from the EBT yard in Saltillo, which climbed the mountain to a tipple below the quarry. The branch was the steepest track on the EBT and remained in service until the line closed in 1956. The quarry continued to operate into the 1970s, served by trucks. The EBT tracks in Saltillo are still in place. The water tank was burned by vandals in the late 1980s and the station was demolished in the mid-2000s after being allowed to deteriorate to deplorable condition. Around 1935 the skeleton of a mastodon was discovered behind the ball field in Saltillo by two young men digging a drainage ditch. They excavated several bones, teeth and both tusks. They gave them to C.R. Cornelius the landowner, who later donated them to Penn State University where they can be seen today. In the 1990s Penn State reopened the dig and found even more bones that were missed during the first excavation. The Hudson Grist Mill at the southwest edge of town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Geography Saltillo is located in southern Huntingdon County at .

George Pullman was the American inventor of the sleeper car. The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s; they could be configured for coach seating during the day. Some of the more luxurious types have private rooms (fully and solidly enclosed rooms that are not shared with strangers). History Possibly the earliest example of a sleeping car (or bed carriage, as it was then called) was on the London & Birmingham and Grand junction Railways between London and Lancashire, England. This was made available to first-class passengers in 1838.Lambert, Anthony J. (1983), Travel in the Twenties and Thirties The first American sleeping car, the \\"Chambersburg\\" started service on the CVRR in 1839. The Cumberland Valley Railroad pioneered sleeping car service in the spring of 1839, with a car named \\"Chambersburg\\", between Chambersburg and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A couple of years later a second car, the \\"Carlisle\\", was introduced into service.Philip Berlin Historical Marker ‚Äì Behind the Marker In 1857, the Wason Manufacturing Company of Springfield, Massachusetts ‚Äì one of the United States ' first makers of railway passenger coach equipment ‚Äì produced America's first specifically designed sleeping car. The man who ultimately made the sleeping car business profitable in the United States was George Pullman, who began by building a luxurious sleeping car (named Pioneer) in 1865. The Pullman Company, founded as the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1867, owned and operated most sleeping cars in the United States until the mid-20th century, attaching them to passenger trains run by the various railroads; there were also some sleeping cars that were operated by Pullman but owned by the railroad running a given train. During the peak years of American passenger railroading, several all-Pullman trains existed, including the 20th Century Limited on the New York Central Railroad, the Broadway Limited on the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Panama Limited on the Illinois Central Railroad, and the Super Chief on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Interior of a Pullman car on the Chicago and Alton Railroad, c. 1900. is configured for daytime operation. Pullman cars were normally a dark \\"Pullman green\\", although some were painted in the host railroad's colors. The cars carried individual names, but usually did not carry visible numbers. In the 1920s, the Pullman Company went through a series of restructuring steps, which in the end resulted in a parent company, Pullman Incorporated, controlling the Pullman Company (which owned and operated sleeping cars) and the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company. Due to an antitrust verdict in 1947, a consortium of railroads bought the Pullman Company from Pullman Incorporated, and subsequently railroads owned and operated Pullman-made sleeping cars themselves. Pullman-Standard continued manufacturing sleeping cars and other passenger and freight railroad cars until 1980. For nearly a year at the end of World War II the United States government banned sleeping cars for runs of less than 450 miles.Editors of Publications International, 'How Stuff Works,' 'Railroads During World War II' https://history.howstuffworks.com/american- history/world-war-ii-railroads2.htm The development of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and the expansion of jet airline travel in the same decade negatively impacted train travel. Cultural impact of Pullman porters B&O; Capitol Limited bound for Chicago One unanticipated consequence of the rise of Pullman cars in the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was their effect on civil rights and African-American culture. Each Pullman car was staffed by a uniformed porter. The majority of Pullman Porters were African Americans. While still a menial job in many respects, Pullman offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, in addition to a chance for travel, and it was a well regarded job in the African-American community of the time. The Pullman attendants, regardless of their true name, were traditionally referred to as \\"George\\" by the travelers, the name of the company's founder, George Pullman. The Pullman company was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States. Subsequently, railway porters fought for political recognition and were eventually unionized. Their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (established, 1925), became an important source of strength for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement in the early 20th century, notably under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph. Because they moved about the country, Pullman porters also became an important means of communication for news and cultural information of all kinds. The African-American newspaper, the Chicago Defender, gained a national circulation in this way. Porters also used to re-sell phonograph records bought in the great metropolitan centres, greatly adding to the distribution of jazz and blues and the popularity of the artists. Open-section accommodation Open section accommodations of a Pullman car in day mode from c.1950s. In 1964, aging open-section Pullman cars waited in Portland, Oregon, available for \\"emergencies\\". From the 19th to the mid-20th century, the most common and more economical type of sleeping car accommodation on North American trains was the \\"open section\\". Open-section accommodations consist of pairs of seats, one seat facing forward and the other backward, situated on either side of a center aisle. The seat pairs can be converted into the combination of an upper and a lower \\"berth\\", each berth consisting of a bed screened from the aisle by a curtain. A famous example of open sections can be seen in the movie Some Like It Hot (1959). NH RR's 1942 World War II advertisement \\"The Kid in Upper 4.\\" This ad depicts an open section of a sleeping car. Private Accommodations As the 20th century progressed, an increasing variety of private rooms was offered. Most of these rooms provided significantly more space than open-section accommodations could offer. Open-sections, in the 1950s were increasingly phased out, in favor of roomettes. Some of them, such as the rooms of the \\"Slumbercoach\\" cars manufactured by the Budd Company and first put into service in 1956, were triumphs of miniaturization. These allowed a single car to increase the number of sleepers over a conventional sleeping car of private rooms.NRHS Bulletin, Summer 2006, Tom Smith, \\"The Budd Slumbercoach Brings Economy to Pullman Passengers\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20101128033028/http://srmduluth.org/Exhibits/SlumberCoaches.pdf =Roomettes= A Roomette, in the historically correct sense of the word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes are placed on both sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes, a Pullman-produced precursor to the Slumbercoach, are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly spartan form of roomette; Slumbercoaches also included a few two- passenger units. =Compartments and Double Bedrooms= Pullman private compartment from c.1950s. Compartments and Double Bedrooms are private rooms for two passengers, with upper and lower berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed on one side of the car, with the corridor running down the other side (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite. =Drawing Rooms and Larger Accommodations= A Drawing Room is a relatively rare accommodation for three people traveling together, again with a washbasin and private toilet, again on one side of the car. Even rarer are larger rooms accommodating four or more; generally the needs of large parties were better served with multiple rooms, with or without the ability to combine them into a suite. =Modern Amtrak Accommodations= Amtrak's Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, although they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that fold out into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room washbasin or toilet, on both sides of both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in access ladder for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a roll-in cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities. When the Viewliner sleeping cars were built, the accommodations were patterned after the Superliner accommodations, except that the Economy Bedrooms (or \\"Viewliner Roomettes\\") include Roomette-style washbasins and toilets, as well as windows for the upper berths. Night trains today Amtrak Viewliner, a single-level sleeping car Despite its recent overall decline in popularity, the overnight train still offers an enjoyable means of transportation for many. Many overnight trains are schduled to arrive at their destination cities in the morning. Although reduced in prevalence in recent decades in the Western world, sleeping cars retain a powerful ability to provide travel that is both reasonably comfortable and potentially time-saving, especially between points that are between and apart, distances one can travel overnight, perhaps with dinner at the beginning of the journey and breakfast at the end. This offers efficiency in passing the time and distance by allowing travelers to do things that might be done in a hotel room during the same hours. The obvious advantage over day trains (even high-speed ones) is that the ride takes up less daytime. An interesting practice in sleeping car operation, one that is not currently employed in North America, is the use of \\"set-out\\" sleepers. Sleeping cars are picked up and/or dropped off at intermediate cities along a train's route so that what would otherwise be partial-night journeys can become (in effect) full-night journeys, with passengers allowed to occupy their sleeping accommodations from mid-evening to at least the early morning. Common practice on such occasions is to close the passages between sleeper cars for the night to prevent accidental wrong destinations. Since 2009, China has been operating high speed sleeper trains. Europe Trenhotel Alhambra between Barcelona and Granada In Europe, the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (French for \\"International Sleeping Car Company\\") first focused on sleeping cars, but later operated whole trains, including the Simplon-Orient Express, Nord Express, Train Bleu, Golden Arrow, and the Transsiberien (on the Trans- Siberian railway). Today it once again specializes in sleeping cars, along with onboard railroad catering. In modern Europe, a number of sleeping car services continue to operate, though they face strong competition from high- speed day trains and budget airlines, sometimes leading to the cancellation or consolidation of services. In some cases, trains are split and recombined in the dead of night, making it possible to offer several connections with a relatively small number of trains. Generally, the trains consist of sleeping cars with private compartments, couchette cars, and sometimes cars with normal seating. An example of a more basic type of sleeping car is the European couchette car, which is divided into compartments for four or six people, with bench-configuration seating during the day and \\"privacyless\\" double- or triple-level bunk-beds at night. Map of European night trains carrying sleeper and/or couchette cars, 2018. =Austria= A CityNightLine double-decker sleeping car √ñBB's modern Nightjet services operate in Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium, and Nightjet's partners will also take passengers to Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The services usually leave at around 20:00 hours and arrive at around 09:00 hours at the destination. 1st class two berth sleeper Kiev to Moscow =Former Soviet Union Countries= In the former Soviet Union overnight train travel formed the main mode of long-distance travel. Distances between the capitals of Moscow and Kiev and many outlying cities being ideal for overnight trips that depart in late evening and arrive at their destinations in the morning. Sleeping cars with berths are the only reasonable solution for railway trips lasting several days (e.g., direct trains from Moscow to Siberian cities). Night trains are to this day a prime method of travel in key Soviet Union successor states like Russia and Ukraine, where a shift towards faster daytime trains with seating rather than sleeping arrangements is hampered by insufficient investments in the railway infrastructure restricting the speed and by a lack of train sets. With its limited geography Belarus has managed to buck this post-Soviet trend and largely made the transition to daytime intercity trains, based on government- funded purchases of rolling stock supplied by Stadler, which operates a train factory in Minsk. The national rail services in Ukraine and Russia continue to operate a large number of sleeper trains, to a large extent based on vintage life-prolonged rolling stock assembled in East Germany back in the 1980s. The use of the old cars help keeping ticket prices on a quite reasonable level by Western standards, starting at below 10 Euros for third-class tickets in Ukraine, with price levels higher in oil-rich Russia. Russia has renewed part of the fleet and introduced double-deck sleeper cars, but comfort levels suffer from a modest degree of innovation in the bogie suspension systems and the passenger compartment design. Around 2000 couchette and sleeper rail cars are in active service on the Ukrainian network, but only one is equipped with private first-class compartments with en-suite bathrooms, and new cars, purchased since 2015 in limited numbers, come without showers. = Croatia = Modern, air-conditioned sleeping cars and couchette cars are part of Croatian Railways rolling stock. Croatian sleeping coaches include single, double or 4-bed compartments with washbasin and many additional hygienic accessories. Passengers also have catering services at their disposal and are given complimentary breakfast, depending on the type of ticket bought. A night train with sleeping carriages included operates on the route between the two largest Croatian towns, Zagreb and Split, and Croatian sleeping coaches are included on the Zagreb-Munich-Zagreb and Zagreb-Z√ºrich-Zagreb EuroNight lines. =France= Another of the more substantial examples of current European sleeping-car service is the Train Bleu, an all-sleeping-car train. It leaves Paris from the Gare d'Austerlitz in mid-evening and arrives in Nice at about 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and couchette accommodation. The train's principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won the same degree of popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper-class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only couchette cars (1st and 2nd class) and seating coaches remain. The Train Bleu is part of the French night service network called Intercit√©s de Nuit. =Italy= In Italy, Ferrovie dello Stato operates an extensive network of trains with sleeping cars, especially between the main cities in Northern Italy and the South, including Sicily using train ferry. =Poland= Sleeping trains in Poland are run by PKP Intercity. =Romania= Night train numbers have been reduced significantly, as the quality of the rail infrastructure is declining and repairs are insufficient, which leads to longer ride times between cities. A journey from the Bucharest main station to Arad (599 km) usually lasts 11 hours 20 minutes when there are no delays. Most night trains in Romania cross the country, covering distances of 400 to 750 km, usually to end at certain international destinations or in large cities at opposite ends of the country. The overwhelming majority of night trains with sleeping coaches are owned and operated by CFR CƒÉlƒÉtori. Recently, private operators such as Astra Rail Carpatica, the newly-founded private operator of Astra Vagoane Arad, has started offering sleeping train services, using own- made sleeping cars and Servtrans locomotives. A WLABmee 71-31 car, the standard sleeping car of the CFR, at the defunct Belgrade Main railway station CFR today prefers operating more couchettes than sleeping cars in its trains, a practice used in Italy and Austria, adopted by the CFR in the early 2010s, thus enabling it to increase the capacity on sleeping trains. The sleeping cars of the CFR in the 1990s consisted of Bautzen and G√∂rlitz-made sleeping cars, standard in the Eastern Bloc. They were replaced by Grivi»õa-made WLABmee 71-70 and Hansa-made WLABmee 71‚Äì31, bought second-hand from Deutsche Bahn. The most recent sleeping-cars are the WLABmee 70-91 made by Astra Arad, which is the same type used by Astra Rail (although the liveries differ), starting from 2014, 2 of the WLABmee 71-70 cars were refurbished, but no other examples have received the same treatment. Other examples that have been withdrawn since were second-hand examples of the TEN MU and T2S types. =Spain and Portugal= In Spain, Trenhotel is a long-distance, high-quality overnight train service which uses Talgo tilting trains technology and sleeping cars developed by the Spanish rail network operator Renfe. It is operated by Renfe and CP where it operates International Sud-Express and Lusitanea between Spain and Portugal, and by its subsidiary Elipsos (a joint venture between Renfe and French SNCF with a 50% share each) when operating in France, Switzerland and Italy. The Estrella (Star) is a low-cost night train between Madrid and Barcelona served by berth carriages, with compartments for up to 6 people. =United Kingdom= A Caledonian Sleeper double berth in the UK In the United Kingdom, a network of trains with sleeping cars operates daily between London and Scotland (Caledonian Sleeper), and between London and the West Country as far as Cornwall (Night Riviera). Using rolling stock designed and formerly operated by British Rail, these services offer a choice of single- or double-occupancy bedrooms. These services operate all week, except Saturdays and usually depart London (Euston and Paddington) in the evening, arriving at their destinations at approx 08:00. The West Country service uses British Rail Mk3 sleeper coaches, whereas Caledonian Sleeper replaced their Mk3 coaches with Mk 5 coaches. =Other countries in Europe with sleeping car services= * Norway * Sweden * Finland * Serbia * Bulgaria * Greece * Slovakia North AmericaCanada= In Canada, all regularly scheduled sleeping car services are operated by Via Rail, using a mixture of relatively new cars and refurbished mid-century ones; the latter cars include both private rooms and \\"open section\\" accommodations. = USA = In the United States, all regularly scheduled sleeping car services are operated by Amtrak. Amtrak offers sleeping cars on most of its overnight trains, using modern cars of the private-room type exclusively. Today, Amtrak operates two main types of sleeping car: the bi-level Superliner sleeping cars, built from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, and the single-level Viewliner sleeping cars, built in the mid-1990s. Superliners are used on most long-distance routes from Chicago westward, while Viewliners are used on most routes east of Chicago due to tunnel clearance issues in and around New York City and Baltimore. In the most common Superliner sleeping car configuration, the upper level is divided into two halves, one half containing \\"Bedrooms\\" (formerly \\"Deluxe Bedrooms\\") for one, two, or three travelers, each Bedroom containing an enclosed toilet-and- shower facility; and the other half containing \\"Roomettes\\" (formerly \\"Economy Bedrooms\\" or \\"Standard Bedrooms\\") for one or two travelers; plus a beverage area and a toilet. The lower level contains more Roomettes; a Family Bedroom for as many as two adults and two children; and an \\"Accessible Bedroom\\" (formerly \\"Special Bedroom\\") for a wheelchair-using traveler and a companion; plus toilets and a shower. The Viewliner cars contain an Accessible Bedroom (formerly \\"Special Bedroom\\") for a wheelchair-using traveler and a companion, with an enclosed toilet-and-shower facility; two Bedrooms (formerly \\"Deluxe Bedrooms\\") for one, two, or three travelers, each Bedroom containing an enclosed toilet-and-shower facility; \\"Roomettes\\" (formerly \\"Economy Bedrooms\\", \\"Standard Bedrooms\\", or \\"Compartments\\") for one or two travelers, each Roomette containing its own unenclosed toilet and washing facilities; and a shower room at the end of the car. South America Countries in South America having trains with sleeper cars * Argentina * Chile AsiaChina= A double-deck conventional passenger sleeping car of China in April 2006 China Railway operates an extensive network of conventional sleeper trains throughout the country, covering all provincial capitals and many major cities. The Chinese \\"hard\\" sleeping car in use today is very basic, consisting of 6 fixed bunk beds per compartment, which can be converted into seats in peak season, especially during Chinese New Year. The middle level bunk bed will be folded and top level bunk bed will still be sold as sleeper, while the lower bed will be occupied by three passengers. Chinese trains also offer \\"soft\\" or deluxe sleeping cars with four or two beds per room. China is the only country to operate high-speed sleeper trains. Sleeper services are operated using high-speed CRH1E, CRH2E and CRH5E trains outfitted with sleeping berths (couchette). Services run between Beijing - Shanghai and Beijing - Guangzhou at speeds of up to , one of the fastest sleeper trains in the world. A new variant of CRH2E consists of double deck capsules in lieu of sleeping berths. These trains have been dubbed \\"moving hotels\\". =India= A major portion of passenger cars in India are sleeper/couchette cars. With railways as one of the primary mode of passenger transport, sleeper cars vary from economical to First Class AC (air conditioned). Most Indian trains come in combinations of first class A/C and non-A/C private sleeper cars with doors, and A/C and non-A/C 3-tier or 2-tier couchette arrangements. =Japan= JR East Cassiopeia sleeper car service from Tokyo to Sapporo with 180 degree views Japan once had many sleeping car trains, but most have been abolished because of the development of air travel, overnight bus services and high-speed rail. As of May 2016, sleeper car trains of regular service in Japan are as follows: * Sunrise Izumo: Tokyo ‚Äì Izumoshi * Sunrise Seto: Tokyo ‚Äì Takamatsu =Malaysia= Keretapi Tanah Melayu, the Malaysian national railway company, offers sleeping car service on several of its long- distance trips. Sometimes the same trip can be made either during the day in a normal carriage or at night on a sleeper. The Kuala Lumpur to Hat Yai train has sleeping cars, since the journey takes 14 hours. = Indonesia = The Indonesian State Railways once had operated sleeper cars on the Bima between its launch in 1967 and 1995, when the last berth (\\"couchette\\") cars were decommissioned. The successor to the Indonesian State Railways, PT Kereta Api Indonesia, operates some first-class train services that are officially called the Luxury class, but are misinterpreted as sleeper trains by mainstream media. There are two generations of Luxury class cars. =Other countries in Asia= * Vietnam * Turkey * Iran * Pakistan * Thailand * Philippines: The Philippine National Railways operated a number of 7A-2000 and 14 class sleeper cars between 1999 and 2013. These units were first built for the Japanese National Railways in 1974 as 14 series passenger cars (ja), and were donated to the Philippines in 1999. They were meant to serve the Bicol Express in the South Main Line. The 7A-2000 class were a group of 5 single-level cars that were decommissioned after being involved in the fatal 2004 Padre Burgos derailment. On the other hand, the 14 class were a group of bilevel-style couchette cars. After all services to the Bicol Region were halted in 2013, the 14-class couchettes were stored in the Tutuban Yard in Manila.

The community was named after the Irish city and county of Armagh, which was the hometown of some of the settlers. Its first school began in 1799, using a log cabin, and in 1805, it established the county's first post office. Many of the original settlers were Presbyterian. The Wheatfield Presbyterian Church, later known simply as the Armagh Presbyterian Church, was started in 1786. The Rev. George Hill, its first minister, was installed in 1792, and was shared with churches in Fairfield and Donegal. In 1820 the congregation built a log church and in 1835-6 replaced it with a white frame church. Another Presbyterian church was built in 1905 in Seward, about 3 miles south. The two congregations merged in 1963. The Armagh church building was destroyed in 2004 after being hit by a truck. The community became a borough on April 10, 1824, having previously been part of East Wheatfield Township. The borough was the birthplace of pioneer American labor leader William H.

The material part is the same as in a trump squeeze or a squeeze without the count. The immaterial part is that depending on the choice of discards of the squeezee an entry into one or into the other hand is created. For that very reason an entry-shifting squeeze is always a positional squeeze. Examples In the first diagram clubs are trumps and South could claim all tricks on a crossruff were it not for the trump in East's hand. When the club jack is played, the entry-shifting squeeze comes to his rescue. If West sheds a heart, the jack is overtaken with the ace, a heart ruffed and North is left with the last trump and a master heart. If West chooses to discard a diamond, the club jack is underplayed with the five. North's club ace ruffs the diamonds good and the South hand wins the last two tricks. The entry-shifting mechanism works also in No Trumps, as can be seen in the next example. As only five tricks out of remaining six cards are required, this is a squeeze without the count. It is not possible to rectify the count as there are not enough communications between the two hands. The entry-shifting mechanism will overcome this though. South leads the A and West has no good discard. If he discards a spade, the J is played and South continues with a spade to the ace and the spade eight. West returns a heart to South's ace, but the diamond king serves as an entry to the established spades. If West chooses to discard a heart, the diamond king is played and after ace of hearts and another heart, the Q will serve as an entry.

The town was created as a \\"model town\\", with a higher caliber of worker housing than other coal mining communities. Houses were constructed of concrete block, not wood. Also, the houses had toilets and the community had a sewer system, which were unusual in comparison to neighboring mining communities. Streets were named after executives of the coal company: F.E. Herriman (President), John Fisher (Vice President), H.B. Douglas (Assistant to the President), A.J. Musser (General Manager), and H.J. Hinterleitner (General Superintendent). The town and its initial buildings were designed by Paul Gill, an engineer of the coal company.

The population was 251 at the 2010 census. History The borough was named in 1889 for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company (glen is the Scottish word for valley), which mined in that area. Popular singer Glen Campbell visited Glen Campbell in 1971. The distinguished academic Glenn Campbell did also at some point.The Indiana Gazette Michael William Menosky, a professional baseball player, also known as \\"Leaping Mike\\" for his speed and circus-like catches in the outfield, was born in Glen Campbell on October 16, 1894. At some point, the family moved about four miles away to Arcadia. Leaping Mike went on to play baseball from 1914 to 1930. He played for the Pittsburgh Rebels, Washington Senators, and the Boston Red Sox. He replaced Babe Ruth in left field after Babe Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, beginning what was referred to as \\"the curse\\" in Boston. Glen Campbell, the first coal town in Indiana County, was founded in 1889. It was named for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company, the enterprise which initiated mining operations in the area. The town experienced immediate growth and soon a number of coal companies were operating in and around the community. In 1894, just five years after its inception, Glen Campbell was incorporated as a borough. The town quickly became the service, business, and shopping center for a number of smaller mining communities that sprang up in northern Indiana County. By 1900 Glen Campbell was the third largest town in Indiana County. It also had the distinction of being the county's fastest-growing community. In fact, residents of the community felt it was plausible that the county seat would someday be moved to Glen Campbell. The town was serviced by both the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads. In addition to coal mining, there were a number of lumber mills. In 1905 the Giant Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company opened operations in Glen Campbell. The company provided electricity to communities in northern Indiana and southern Clearfield counties. Other industries included a brickyard which was established on the Cush Creek, a stream that flows through the community, and a cooper's shop which manufactured barrels. Later a battery factory was opened. There also were plans for the construction of a foundry and a furniture factory. At its height of prosperity, the town had approximately sixty businesses. There was an opera house and a nickelodeon. The community boasted its own school system, which included a high school. There were a number of dentists and doctors. One doctor even operated an infirmary for the miners. The borough had its own bank, the First National Bank of Glen Campbell. A number of newspapers were published in the town, and many social organizations sprang up. Unfortunately, the bubble burst. Labor unrest, the decline in coal output, the depletion of timber stocks, and a number of disastrous fires left Glen Campbell in serious financial condition. The Great Depression dealt the town its final blow. The bank closed permanently, and a number of businesses either folded or moved elsewhere. The community never recovered. Although its heyday has long since passed, the town still has the capability of attracting notoriety. It received national attention in 1971 when Glen Campbell, the country music singer, made a surprise visit. The trip was featured in a TV Guide article later that year. Although no longer the size it once was, Glen Campbell continues to function in its own right. The town's fire company provides fire protection to a number of communities in the area. Its three churches (Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic) all have active congregations. Social organizations include the American Legion and the Glen Campbell Fireman's Auxiliary. The town's post office still provides rural services to a large area surrounding the borough. There are a number of businesses, including some which are coal related, that call Glen Campbell home. http://www.indianacounty.org The Sen. Joseph O.

This marriage was unhappy and was characterized by struggles about their children. Sophie was a liberal intellectual, hating everything leaning toward dictatorship, such as the army. William was simpler, more conservative, and loved the military. He prohibited intellectual exercise at home, for which action Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who corresponded with Princess Sophie, called him an uneducated farmer. His extramarital enthusiasms, however, led the New York Times to call him \\"the greatest debauchee of the age\\".\\"Holland's Queen\\" - New York Times September 26, 1897 Another cause of marital tension (and later political tension) was his capriciousness; he could rage against someone one day, and be extremely polite the next. William loathed the 1848 constitutional changes initiated by his father (William II) and Johan Rudolf Thorbecke. His father saw them as key to the monarchy's survival in changing times. Sophie, who was a liberal, also shared this view. William himself saw them as useless limitations of royal power, and would have preferred to govern as an enlightened despot in the mold of his grandfather, William I. He considered relinquishing his right to the throne to his younger brother Henry and later to his older son. His mother convinced him to cancel this action. The Dutch constitution provided no way to relinquish one's claim to the throne. On 17 March 1849 his father died and William succeeded to the throne of the Netherlands. He was at that moment a guest of the Duchess of Cleveland in Raby Castle. Representatives of the Dutch government traveled to London to meet their new king in London. William was reluctant to return, but he was convinced to do so. Upon arrival the new Queen welcomed her spouse with the question \\"did you accept?\\". The new king nodded, but he remained uncertain about the matter for some time.Dik van der Meulen, William III Biography 2013 Reign Portrait of King William III (1859) by Nicolaas Pieneman William repeatedly contemplated abdicating as soon as his eldest son William, Prince of Orange, turned eighteen. This occurred in 1858, but as William was uncomfortable making a decision he remained king. His first act was the inauguration of the parliamentary cabinet of Thorbecke, the liberal designer of the 1848 constitution, whom William loathed. When the Roman Catholic hierarchy of bishops was restored in 1853 he found growing conservative support and a reason to dismiss Thorbecke. In the first two decades of his reign, he dismissed several cabinets and disbanded the States- General several times, installing royal cabinets which ruled as long as there was support in the elected second chamber of parliament. In what became known as the \\"Luxembourg Coup of 1856\\", William unilaterally instituted a new, reactionary constitution for Luxembourg, which he ruled personally, separate from the Netherlands crown. In 1867, France offered to buy Luxembourg, leading to the Luxembourg Crisis, which almost precipitated war between Prussia and France. However, the subsequent Second Treaty of London re-established Luxembourg as a fully independent country. During his reign, the king became more and more unpopular with his bourgeois-liberal subjects, his whims provoking their resistance and mockery, but remained quite popular with the common man. The king was a man of immense stature and with a boisterous voice. He could be gentle and kind, then suddenly he could become intimidating and even violent. He kicked and hit his servants about. He was inclined to terrorize and humiliate his courtiers. The king was cruel to animals as well. His ministers were afraid of him. Most people around him agreed that he was, to some degree, insane. Emma and King William III The king could be erratic, he ordered the dismissal and even the arrest and execution of those that he found in lack of respect, including a Mayor of The Hague. Orders like these were disregarded. The king who thought of himself as a specialist on all matters military frequently tried to take command of manoeuvres, creating chaos wherever he went. In 1877, Queen Sophie died and years of war in the palace came to an end. In the same year, King William announced his intention to marry √âmilie Ambre, a French opera singer, whom he ennobled as countess d'Ambroise ‚Äì without government consent. Under pressure from society and the government, he abandoned these marriage plans. William remained eager to remarry. In 1878, he first proposed to his niece, Princess Elisabeth of Saxe- Weimar. He then considered marriage with Princess Pauline of Waldeck and Pyrmont, a small German principality, and Princess Thyra of Denmark, who had her own private scandalous history. He finally decided to marry Pauline's younger sister Emma. Some politicians were quite angry, as she was 41 years the king's junior. Emma showed herself, however, as a cordial woman. William asked permission from parliament, this was easily granted. The couple were quickly married in Arolsen on 7 January 1879. Emma had a relieving influence on William's capricious personality and the marriage was extremely happy. The last decade was without any doubt the best of his reign. The king had stopped interfering with most aspects of government. In 1880, Wilhelmina was born. She became heiress presumptive in 1884 after the death of the last remaining son from William's first marriage. Many potential male heirs had died between 1878 and 1884. King William became seriously ill in 1887. He was suffering from a kidney-ailment. However, in 1888, he personally presented a gold medal of honor to the lifeboat hero Dorus Rijkers, for saving the lives of 20 people. Funeral of William III in 1890 In 1888 and 1889 the ailing king became increasingly demented. The Council of State and then Queen Emma became regents. William III died in Het Loo in 1890. Because Wilhelmina had not yet reached adulthood, Emma became regent for her daughter. She would remain regent until Wilhelmina's eighteenth birthday in 1898. Because the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg could only be inherited through the male Nassau line under the terms of the house-treaty of the House of Nassau, it went to William's 17th cousin once removed (and incidentally Emma's uncle on her mother's side), Adolphe, Duke of Nassau. His branch of the House of Nassau still governs the Grand Duchy.

The population was 1,707 at the 2010 census. Homer City is located in the Indiana metro area. The community was named for the famous Greek poet Homer by founder William Wilson in 1854. It was incorporated as a borough in 1872. History The two treaties of Fort Stanwix (of 1768 and, after American independence, of 1784) secured the westward expansion of Pennsylvania into the region where the Borough of Homer City is now located, on land inhabited by the six Indian nations. With white settlement these new territories were initially organized as part of existing counties in eastern and central Pennsylvania. White settlers were few in the eighteenth century and encountering Indians still very much a part of daily life. Any degree of stability and safety came only after the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794). Indiana County was carved out of Westmoreland and Lycoming counties in 1803 and divided into three townships: Wheatfield, Armstrong, and Mahoning. The confluence of Two Lick and Yellow creeks (present-day Homer City) was a contender for the seat of government for the new county, but instead the \\"extraordinary overtures\\" of George Clymer, a local landowners and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, saw the county seat situated instead in what would become the Borough of Indiana. Center Township - the unincorporated area surrounding present-day Homer City - was created from a portion of Armstrong Township in 1807, its landscape dotted with larger and smaller family homesteads (farms) and an increasing number of mills and trading posts. Parts of Center Township were settled early on by Scots-Irish Presbyterians as in other parts of Indiana County, but Methodist families of English and Welsh descent came to dominate the Homer City area, and they remained prominent in its civic and commercial life well into the twentieth century. William Wilson laid out the village of Homer in 1854 naming it after the Classical Greek poet. For several years, however, its post office was designated Phillips Mill (or Mills on some maps), a name derived from that of early settler Armour Phillips, Sr. When the village became a borough in 1872 - with the consolidation and annexation of neighboring parcels - more and more it was referred to as Homer City. With a post office and a stop (later station) on the Pennsylvania Railroad line, the Borough of Homer City developed along the lines of many small towns in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It traditionally offered goods and services including merchants, a bank, medical professionals, craftsmen, and schools not only to borough residents, but also to inhabitants of surrounding, rural Center Township. The township's development took a different path. Enduring settlements beyond family homesteads awaited the establishment of villages (company towns) by coal companies in the early twentieth century. More often than not they bore the names of the companies, their owners, families and company executives (e.g., Waterman, Graceton, Luciusboro) as in other parts of Indiana County. The general prosperity of the post-World War II era saw the greater affluence of Homer City and Center Township residents, better (wider, paved) roads and increased automobile ownership leading to the expansion of residential areas at the edges of Homer City and into the once rural farmland of Center Township - in the form of sub-developments and individually owned homesteads (non-agricultural lots). These trends have continued with newer developments such as Red Maple Drive and Mystic Rock on Route 56 in Center Township and the housing developments outside the village of Lucerne (Mines). The Homer-Center School District has boundaries coterminous with the Borough of Homer City and surrounding Center Township. This fact, combined with the use of \\"Homer City\\" as a mailing address and telephone exchange, has often blurred the boundaries of the Borough and Center Township even though they remain distinct political entities. Residences and businesses beyond the confines of the Borough (and even beyond those of Center Township) can possess \\"Homer City\\" mailing addresses and telephone numbers. Examples include the Homer City Generating Station and Non-Lethal Technologies, both of which are referenced in this article. A novella called The Roving Red Rangers or Laura Lamar of the Susquehanna by Charles Asbury Robinson, was set in the Homer City area. It was published by the author in 1902. It has often been erroneously understood as a work of non-fiction and given rise to mistaken notions about local history, especially when the name \\"Laura Lamar\\" derived from a character in this novella was suggested and adopted as the name of the local school district in the 1952.  Contemporary Homer City  200px Businesses within the borough that provide goods and services to residents include a bank, a grocery store, a dollar store, restaurants, hair salons, physicians' offices, a distillery and other service-oriented businesses. The community is served by the Borough of Homer City Police and the Homer City Volunteer Fire Department. Among the oldest existing structures in Homer City are its churches including Homer City United Methodist Church, Homer City United Presbyterian Church, Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church, Holy Protection (a.k.a. St. Mary's) Byzantine Catholic Church and Saints Peter and Paul Orthodox Church. The Homer City Generating Station, located in Center Township, has the tallest chimney in the United States and the third tallest in the world. The borough's local radio station is 1160 WCCS \\"The Voice of Indiana County\\". Homer City gained national and international prominence in the early twentieth century as the location of the Prairie State Incubator Company - particularly after its products appeared on display at various exhibitions and trade shows across the country. After its production facilities were twice destroyed by fire, the company built a new state-of-the-art \\"fire-proof\\" facility but ceased production shortly thereafter. In 1920 the same building became the new home of industrial toolmaker, the Syntron Company. (Its name derived from an early product known as the SYNchronous elecTRONic hammer). It was, for many years, the single largest employer within the boundaries of the Borough of Homer City. It continued to operate, after a merger, as a division of Chicago-based FMC Corporation until June 2007. Over the last several decades Homer City Generating Station, located in Center Township, has also made national news many times. Non-Lethal Technologies, Inc. has a Homer City address, even though its physical location is near Aultman and Jacksonville. The company manufactures CS Gas that has been used to suppress protests in Bahrain, Turkey and Greece. Each CS canister produced by the company shows the address of its manufacturer General information * ZIP code: 15748 * Area Code: 724 * Local Phone Exchanges: 479 915 Education The Borough is a part of the Homer-Center School District, with the schools being located just south of the Borough line.

This Rails-to-Trails initiative follows the route of the former Pennsylvania Railroad line and provides recreational opportunities for walkers, runners, and cyclists. A recent project by Indiana County Parks and Trails placed helpful signage along the Hoodlebug Trail and information kiosks describing historical and natural sights located on or adjacent to the trail. The name derives from the hoodlebug, or doodlebug, a self-propelled railroad car that ran from Indiana to Blairsville on the Pennsylvania Railroad line and provided local passenger and mail service. It ceased operations in 1940. Naming the trail after this piece of local history was suggested by Homer City resident Robert McAnulty. Floodway Park Floodway Park, bounded by North Main Street, Station Street, the Center Township boundary, and Yellow Creek, is a multi-use recreational site maintained by Homer-Center Parks and Recreation. It offers visitors two softball fields with bleachers, a pavilion with electricity, a walking trail, restroom facilities, parking for events and serves as a \\"trailhead\\" for the Hoodlebug Trail. Its name speaks volumes about the history of this section of the borough and the origins of the park itself. It is located on a natural flood plain adjacent to Yellow Creek Park, and it represents a different approach to land use: it can be developed and used on a regular basis, but in ways that do not profoundly inhibit the flood plain nor will structures built on the plain be ruined should severe flooding occur. Prior to the Flood of '77 the area was an extension of the Main Street/Downtown Business District. C. S. Kunkle Lumber, Sesti's Restaurant, the Colonial Hotel, and the original location of Luther Ford Sales at one point all stood where the park is now found. (A residential neighborhood was located behind the businesses, too. On the opposite side of the creek the Empire - later Homer City - Theater dating to 1913 was another prominent structure.) The entire area was decimated by the Flood of 1977 with clean-up and restoration of the landscape lasting into the 1980s and the dedication of the park in the early 1990s. Caboose-Museum Site The museum site The Caboose-Museum Site (240 N. Main St), situated on a narrow strip of land between Floodway Park and the Hoodlebug Trail, is owned and operated by the Homer-Center Historical Society. The original museum is a re-purposed, vintage Pennsylvania Railroad caboose that houses artifacts, documents and research materials related to the history of the Borough of Homer City and Center Township. The adjacent Annex (a mini-barn) is used for larger displays and storage while the grounds themselves also display additional artifacts and a commemorative walkway made up of donated engraved bricks. The Caboose-Museum is open to visitors on Saturdays and Sundays from Memorial Day through Labor day and by appointment. The Historical Society partnered with the Borough of Homer City in its \\"Local Hero\\" Banner Program for Veterans. Over 140 2' x 5' banners honoring the military service of local individuals and donated by family and friends are mounted on utility poles along Main Street and adjacent side streets from Memorial Day through Veterans' Day. The Hoodlebug SummerFest The Hoodlebug Festival, organized by a committee of the Homer City Area Business Association, is a festival held in early September. It hosts a variety of games and activities for local residents. Originally named SummerFest when it was held in July, the festival's name comes from the nickname of a passenger train service that was discontinued in the 1940s and its namesake, the Hoodlebug Trail.

The post office used a name distinct from the town (Brady Post Office) until December 26, 1890 when both were changed to Marion Center. Map of Buffalo, Rochester, and Pittsburgh Railway, 1907. Marion Center is located in the spur to the right of Pittsburgh just south of the Indiana Junction. In 1885, New York banker Adrien Iselin purchased the Buffalo, Rochester, and Pittsburgh Railway. A branch near the Jefferson-Indiana County Line (Indiana Junction) led south into Indiana County ending at Vintondale. The tracks from Jefferson County into Indiana County were first laid near Juneau in October 1902. Trains ran through Marion Center by April 1903. The first passenger train stopped at Marion Center on May 3, 1904. The last train, the Hoodlbug, left on June 10, 1950.Busovicki, John. (2003). Postcard History Series: Indiana County.

Hotel Marion, built in 1879 by Alexander Adams, had 15 rooms and was three stories tall. It burned in the 1920s. The second hotel, Mahoning House, at the corner of Main and Manor Streets, occupied the site of the former general store operated by McLaughlin, Kinter, and Company. Horatio Simons converted it to a hotel on June 1, 1904. It was torn down in the 1930s to make way for Harry Black's service station. A dentist office (operated by Dr. L. N. Park) and a pharmacy (operated by William Griffith) were located on Main Street near the store of H. P. Wetzel (located at Craig and Main Streets). By 1887, Wetzel had built a store measuring 20- by . He later added an additional to the store. He was succeeded by Frank Wetzel who operated a grocery store on the site until the 1940s.

One unnamed tributary of Pine Run flows through the borough. It runs generally east-west and flows just south of Park Avenue, connecting to Pine Run west of the borough line and east of U.S. Highway 119. This stream has two in-flows. The first is very narrow, being small enough to easily step across, and drains the east side of the hill in the southeast section of the borough. The second drains the west side of the same hill and connects to the main flow behind the post office near its intersection with South Manor Street.

History On June 20, 1769, William Gray commended the first survey in the Saltsburg area. Early settlers of the wooded region were mainly Scots-Irish immigrants. From 1768 until 1795, people migrated west and found the town of Saltsburg and Indiana County. Those settlers did not take full advantage of the area near the Kiskiminetas River until 1795 because of the threat and attacks of Native Americans. The name ‚ÄúSaltsburg‚Äù assumes a relation of the salt grain to this town. It is true that salt flourished in this ‚Äúnewly discovered‚Äù area. A Mrs. Deemer was the first who noted this discovery. Around the years 1795-1798, the woman responsible proved salt was present in the Conemaugh River, about one mile above Saltsburg‚Äôs present site, in a town now known as Moween. Mrs. Deemer produced a sample of salt by simply evaporating the water from the river. In January 1817 the first sale of land was made to the Congregation of Saltsburg. In 1816-1817 Andrew Boggs purchased a large amount of land, which held the first town lots. The town was named with common consent of her first settlers, based on the newly thriving salt industry. The town‚Äôs religion was mainly Presbyterian, which was also the denomination of the first church built in Saltsburg. The first house was built in 1820, and now is occupied with the Presbyterian Church. The town quickly filled with merchants in the late 1820s, and the town became a prosperous place to reside. John Carson became the first tailor in 1827. Daniel Davis was the first blacksmith in 1828, and George Johnston was the first merchant in 1829. The population of the town continued to grow, and in 1838, the town was declared a borough. In 1840 the estimated population was 335. The primary means of transportation in the area were on foot, carriage, train or boat. The canal and train were fairly new to the people living in the area, but they adapted well. The canal and railroad were major trade conduits for the town and the region. As the town grew it became a site for the passage of the main line canal from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh. Coal and salt were transported along the canal and the building of boats became very important. In 1835 and 1836, Robert Young, Butler Meyers and Jacob Newhouse opened the first canal-boat construction business in the town. Newhouse and his workers crafted some of the finest heavy freight boats the old canal ever saw. For several years boat building was said to be the chief industry of the town. In 1855 the railroad bridge was built, with Major S.S. Jameson as the contractor and with the help of the principal mason John Marth. By 1864 the railroad brought an end to the canal era. The growth of the town was minimal until coalmines became prevalent in the 1870s. Dr. John McFarland, a graduate of Jefferson Medical College was the town‚Äôs first physician; he came to Saltsburg in 1836. In addition to being a physician, Dr. McFarland was also the director of the Indiana County Medical Society and an instructor at the Saltsburg Academy. Later he served in the state House of Representatives from 1845‚Äì46 and became a man of the railroad industry. He was one of the first directors of the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad. The first school was a log house located closer to the trestlework or railroad bridge. John Whittlesey was the first teacher, and John Bucklin was the second. The Saltsburg Academy was established in 1852. It was approximately 52 feet long by 30 feet wide. The town of Saltsburg is located in the southwestern corner of Indiana County, Pennsylvania. It currently has an estimated population of 923. The borough maintains its own police department and currently has one police officer. Supplemental police protection is provided by the Pennsylvania State Police. Saltsburg also has its own volunteer fire department (Station 131). There is an elementary school as well as a high school. They are located next to the Kiskiminetas River. Being so small, the economy of Saltsburg is based on small restaurants, a few salons, a gas station, and a grocery store. The Rebecca B. Hadden Stone House Museum is located at 105 Point Street and has survived many floods, the construction of the railroad, and has been standing since the days of the canal. The Saltsburg Area Historical Society is an organization that continues to retain information from the past of the town and the people and their ancestors of the area. The Saltsburg Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

His Poems from the Trenches are recognized as some of the most outstanding poetry written during the First World War. Early life Isaac Rosenberg was born in Bristol, the second of six children and the eldest son (his twin brother died at birth) of his parents, Barnett (formerly Dovber) and Hacha Rosenberg, who were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Britain from Dvinsk (now in Latvia). In 1897, the family moved to Stepney, a poor district of the East End of London, and one with a large Jewish community. Isaac Rosenberg attended St. Paul's Primary School at Wellclose Square, St George in the East parish. Later, he went to the Baker Street Board School in Stepney, which had a strong Jewish presence.Vivien Noakes (Editor.) Isaac Rosenberg. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. See: Chronological Summary of Isaac Rozenberg's Life, pp. XXYII ‚Äì XXXYI. During discussions of immigration issues in the House of Commons it was revealed that in Boys Department of the Baker Street Board School, Stepney, in 1901, there were \\"280 foreigners as against 29 English\\" pupils. ‚Äî Great Britain. Parliament. ‚Äì 1902, p. 1274 In 1902, he received a good conduct award and was allowed to take classes at the Arts and Crafts School in Stepney Green. In December 1904, he left the Baker Street School, and in January 1905, started an apprenticeship with Carl Hentschel, an engraver from Fleet Street. He became interested in both poetry and visual art, and started to attend evening classes at Birkbeck College. He withdrew from his apprenticeship in January 1911, as he had managed to find the finances to attend the Slade School of Fine Art at University College, London (UCL). During his time at Slade School, Rosenberg notably studied alongside David Bomberg, Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, Dora Carrington, William Roberts, and Christopher Nevinson. He was taken up by Laurence Binyon and Edward Marsh, and began to write poetry seriously, but he suffered from ill-health. He published a pamphlet of ten poems, Night and Day, in 1912. He also exhibited paintings at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1914. Afraid that his chronic bronchitis would worsen, Rosenberg hoped to cure himself by relocating in 1914 to the warmer climate of South Africa, where his sister Mina lived in Cape Town. The Jewish Educational Aid Society of London helped by paying the fare. After arriving in Cape Town in the end of June 1914, he composed a poem On Receiving News of the War. While many wrote about war as patriotic sacrifice, Rosenberg was critical of it from the outset. However, feeling better and hoping to find employment as an artist in Britain, Rosenberg returned home in March 1915. He published a second collection of poems, Youth and then after being unable to find a permanent job enlisted in the British Army at the end of October 1915. He asked that half of his pay be sent to his mother.The Forgotten Jewish Great War Poet, Revived: Long-gone writer is introduced to new readers with the help of graphic art, Tablet, 8 January 2015. In a personal letter, Rosenberg described his attitude towards war, \\"I never joined the army for patriotic reasons. Nothing can justify war. I suppose we must all fight to get the trouble over.\\"Field, F. (1991). British and French writers of the First World War: Comparative studies in cultural history. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, p. 235. First World War Private Rosenberg, personal service number 22311 Rosenberg was assigned to the 12th Bantam Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment, a bantam being a designation for men under the usual minimum height of 5'3\\". After apparently declining a promotion to lance corporal, Rosenberg was transferred, first, to the South Lancashire Regiment, then to the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment. He was sent with his unit to serve on the Western Front in France, where he arrived on 3 June 1916. He continued to write poetry while serving in the trenches, including \\"Break of Day in the Trenches\\", \\"Returning We Hear the Larks\\", and \\"Dead Man's Dump\\". In December 1916, Poetry Magazine published two of his poems. In January 1917, Rosenberg reported sick and his family and friends asked his superiors to remove him from the front lines; he was transferred to the Fortieth Division Works Battalion and started to deliver barbed wire to the trenches. He wrote his poem Dead Man's Dump during this period. In June, he was temporarily assigned to the 229 Field Company, Royal Engineers. In September 1916, he spent ten days in London on leave. After returning to his old unit, he fell sick in October and spent two months in the 51st General Hospital. After release, he was transferred to the 1st Battalion of the King's Own Royal Regiment (KORL). He applied for a transfer to one of the all-Jewish battalions formed in Mesopotamia, but historians have been unable to trace his application.Wilson, J. M. (2009). Isaac Rosenberg: The making of a great war poet: a new life. Evanston, Ill: Northwestern University Press. On 21 March 1918, the German Army started its Spring Offensive on the Western Front. A week later, Rosenberg sent his last letter with a poem \\"Through These Pale Cold Days\\" to England before going to the front lines with reinforcements. Having just finished a night patrol, he was killed on the night of 1 April 1918 with another ten KORL soldiers; there is a dispute as to whether his death occurred at the hands of a sniper or in close combat. In either case, he died in a town called Fampoux, north-east of Arras. He was first buried in a mass grave, but in 1926 the unidentified remains of the six KORL soldiers were individually re-interred at Bailleul Road East Cemetery, Plot V, Saint-Laurent-Blangy, Pas de Calais, France.

In 1895 his first book, Dutch Etchers of the Seventeenth Century, was published. In that same year, Binyon moved into the Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings, under Campbell Dodgson. In 1909, Binyon became its Assistant Keeper, and in 1913, he was made the Keeper of the new Sub-Department of Oriental Prints and Drawings. Around then, he played a crucial role in the formation of Modernism in London by introducing young Imagist poets such as Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington and H.D. to East Asian visual art and literature.Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Many of Binyon's books produced at the museum were influenced by his own sensibilities as a poet although some were works of plain scholarship, such as his four-volume catalogue of all of the museum's English drawings and his seminal catalogue of Chinese and Japanese prints. Laurence Binyon, 1898, drypoint by William Strang In 1904, he married historian Cicely Margaret Powell, and the couple had three daughters. During those years, Binyon belonged to a circle of artists, as a regular patron of the Wiener Cafe of London. His fellow intellectuals there were Ezra Pound, Sir William Rothenstein, Walter Sickert, Charles Ricketts, Lucien Pissarro and Edmund Dulac. Binyon's reputation before the First World War was such that on the death of the Poet Laureate Alfred Austin in 1913, Binyon was among the names mentioned in the press as his likely successor (others named included Thomas Hardy, John Masefield and Rudyard Kipling, but the post went to Robert Bridges). \\"For the Fallen\\" Moved by the opening of what was then called the Great War and the already-high number of casualties of the British Expeditionary Force, Binyon wrote his \\"For the Fallen\\" in 1914, with its \\"Ode of Remembrance\\" (the third and fourth or simply the fourth stanza of the poem). At the time, he was visiting the cliffs on the north Cornwall coast, either at Polzeath or at Portreath. (There is a plaque at each site to commemorate the event, but Binyon himself mentioned Polzeath in a 1939 interview. The confusion may be related to Porteath Farm being near Polzeath.) The piece was published by The Times in September, when public feeling was affected by the recent Battle of the Marne. Today Binyon's most famous poem, \\"For the Fallen\\", is often recited at British Remembrance Sunday services; is an integral part of Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand and of 11 November Remembrance Day services in Canada. \\"Titled; For the Fallen, the ode first appeared in The Times on 21 September 1914. It has now become known in Australia as the Ode of Remembrance: the verse in bold above is read at dawn services and other ANZAC tributes.\\" The \\"Ode of Remembrance\\" has thus been claimed as a tribute to all casualties of war, regardless of nation. :They went with songs to the battle, they were young. :Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow. :They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted, :They fell with their faces to the foe. :They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: :Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. :At the going down of the sun and in the morning, :We will remember them. :They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; :They sit no more at familiar tables of home; :They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; :They sleep beyond England's foam (This \\"Ode to Remembrance\\" comprises the central three stanzas of the seven-stanza poem \\"For the Fallen\\", being preceded, and followed, by two additional stanzas. The Ode itself, as used in remembrance services, is more usually only the central stanza of the three shown above. The full poem may be found here.) Three of Binyon's poems, including \\"For the Fallen\\", were set by Sir Edward Elgar in his last major orchestra/choral work, The Spirit of England.Stout, Janis. \\"'This Dreadful Winnowing-Fan': Rhetoric of War in Edward Elgar's The Spirit of England\\", Choral Journal, 44.9, April 2004, pp. 9‚Äì19 In 1915, despite being too old to enlist in the armed forces, Binyon volunteered at a British hospital for French soldiers, H√¥pital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois, Haute-Marne, France, working briefly as a hospital orderly. He returned in the summer of 1916 and took care of soldiers taken in from the Verdun battlefield. He wrote about his experiences in For Dauntless France (1918) and his poems, \\"Fetching the Wounded\\" and \\"The Distant Guns\\", were inspired by his hospital service in Arc-en-Barrois. Artists Rifles, a CD audiobook published in 2004, includes a reading of \\"For the Fallen\\" by Binyon himself. The recording itself is undated and appeared on a 78 rpm disc issued in Japan. Other Great War poets heard on the CD include Siegfried Sassoon, Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, David Jones and Edgell Rickword.Artists Rifles (1914‚Äì18). Ltmrecordings.com. Retrieved on 19 July 2016. Later life After the war, he returned to the British Museum and wrote numerous books on art, in particular on William Blake, Persian art, and Japanese art. His work on ancient Japanese and Chinese cultures offered strongly-contextualised examples that inspired, among others, the poets Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats. Binyon's work on Blake and his followers kept alive the then nearly-forgotten memory of the work of Samuel Palmer. Binyon's duality of interests continued the traditional interest of British visionary Romanticism in the rich strangeness of Mediterranean and Oriental cultures. Laurence Binyon In 1931, his two- volume Collected Poems appeared. In 1932, Binyon rose to be the Keeper of the Prints and Drawings Department, but in 1933, he retired from the British Museum. He went to live in the country at Westridge Green, near Streatley, Berkshire, where his daughters also came to live during the Second World War, and he continued to write poetry. In 1933‚Äì1934, Binyon was appointed Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. He delivered a series of lectures on The Spirit of Man in Asian Art, which were published in 1935. Binyon continued his academic work. In May 1939, he gave the prestigious Romanes Lecture in Oxford on Art and Freedom, and in 1940, he was appointed the Byron Professor of English Literature at University of Athens. He worked there until he was forced to leave, narrowly escaping the German invasion of Greece in April 1941 . He was succeeded by Lord Dunsany, who held the chair in 1940‚Äì1941. Binyon had been friends with Pound since around 1909, and in the 1930s, the two became especially close; Pound affectionately called him \\"BinBin\\" and assisted Binyon with his translation of Dante. Another prot√©g√© was Arthur Waley, whom Binyon employed at the British Museum. Between 1933 and 1943, Binyon published his acclaimed translation of Dante's Divine Comedy in an English version of terza rima, made with some editorial assistance by Ezra Pound. He dedicated twenty years on his translation and finished it shortly before his death. Its readership was dramatically increased when Paolo Milano selected it for \\"The Portable Dante\\" in Viking's Portable Library series. Binyon significantly revised his translation of all three parts for the project, and the volume went through three major editions and eight printings (while other volumes in the same series went out of print) before it was replaced by the Mark Musa translation in 1981. During the Second World War, Binyon continued to write poetry including a long poem about the London Blitz, \\"The Burning of the Leaves\\", which is regarded by many to be his masterpiece. In 2016, Paul O'Prey edited a new selection of his poems, Poems of Two Wars, which brought together the poems written during both wars, with an introductory essay on Binyon's work that makes the case for his later poetry to be considered as his best. At his death, Binyon was working on a major three-part Arthurian trilogy, the first part of which was published after his death as The Madness of Merlin (1947). He died in Dunedin Nursing Home, Bath Road, Reading, on 10 March 1943, aged 73, after an operation. A funeral service was held at Trinity College Chapel, Oxford, on 13 March 1943. There is a slate memorial in St. Mary's Church, Aldworth, where Binyon's ashes were scattered. On 11 November 1985, Binyon was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.Poets of the Great War. Net.lib.byu.edu. Retrieved on 19 July 2016. The inscription on the stone quotes a fellow Great War poet, Wilfred Owen. It reads: \\"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity\\".Preface.

Helen Binyon (1904‚Äì1979) studied with Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious, illustrating many books for the Oxford University Press, and was also a marionettist. She later taught puppetry and published Puppetry Today (1966) and Professional Puppetry in England (1973). Margaret Binyon wrote children's books, which were illustrated by Helen. Nicolete, as Nicolete Gray, was a distinguished calligrapher and art scholar.

The older Severn Bridge is in the foreground and the newer Prince of Wales Bridge in the background. Severn crossing is a term used to refer to the two motorway crossings over the River Severn estuary between England and Wales operated by Highways England. The two crossings are: *Severn Bridge () *Prince of Wales Bridge (), until 2018 known as the Second Severn Crossing (Ail Groesfan Hafren). The first motorway suspension bridge was inaugurated on 8 September 1966, and the newer cable- stayed bridge, a few miles to the south, was inaugurated on 5 June 1996. The Prince of Wales Bridge (Second Severn Crossing) marks the upper limit of the Severn Estuary. From 1966 to 1996, the bridge carried the M4 motorway. On completion of the Second Severn crossing the motorway from Aust on the English side to Chepstow was renamed the M48. The Second Severn Crossing was officially renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge on 2 July 2018. The two Severn crossings are regarded as the main crossing points from England into South Wales. Before 1966 road traffic between the southern counties of Wales and the southern counties of England had either to travel via Gloucester or to take the Aust Ferry, which ran roughly along the line of the Severn Bridge, from Old Passage near Aust to Beachley. The ferry ramps at Old Passage and Beachley are still visible. Until 17 December 2018, tolls were collected on both crossings from vehicles travelling in a westward direction only; the toll for small vehicles was ¬£5.60. The Severn Crossing reverted to public ownership on 8 January 2018, run by Highways England.  Railway crossings  The Severn Tunnel, carrying mainline trains under the Severn along the South Wales Main Line has been followed in its original route by the Second Severn Crossing. From 1879 until its collapse in 1960 the Severn Railway Bridge also carried trains across the Severn from Sharpness to Lydney. Future=Severn Barrage proposal A proposed Severn Barrage could constitute a third crossing if one is ever built. It has been suggested that such a barrage could carry a road crossing. Until recently, a rail link over a barrage had been ruled out because it would contain a huge set of shipping locks that the rails would need to traverse. It has since been suggested that a rail bridge could carry smaller, modern trains over the locks, making a rail link possible. However, a report by the Department of Transport as part of the 2008-2010 Severn Tidal Power feasibility study carried out by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, concluded that there was no current need for new transport links, either by road or rail. As the UK Government opted not to pursue a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary after the report was published, it seems unlikely that a third crossing will be built in the near future. 2018 Third Severn Crossing proposal The county of Gloucestershire's 2050 Vision was launched in 2018, and contains a proposal for a third Severn Crossing between Lydney and Sharpness. This would replicate the former Severn Bridge Railway.

After a federal district judge denied the FTC's request for an injunction, Owens-Illinois acquired Brockway's shares. 2013 State Police shooting On Thursday, September 26, 2013, two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were serving a warrant to a resident just outside Brockway around 2:30 pm on Cemetery Road. When the troopers knocked on the door, they were answered with gunshots. One trooper was hit in the neck and chest but was pulled to safety by the other trooper. The injured trooper was life-flighted to UPMC Altoona, listed in critical condition. The suspect retreated to his home while multiple police agencies from the surrounding area responded to the scene. He barricaded himself inside and kept police forces on scene overnight. The SERT team was on scene to provide assistance, as well as multiple Pennsylvania State Police helicopters which circled the area in case the suspect tried to flee his house. It is believed but not confirmed that officers couldn't storm the house because the suspect was threatening to blow up a meth lab inside his residence. Both the schools in the Brockway Area School District were locked down, and no students were permitted to leave the buildings. The lockdown began shortly after the shooting and lasted until 6:00 PM that evening. The school is located roughly two miles away from the scene. The police also asked that all residents remained inside, as this situation was still labeled as an active shooter over night. The wounded officer was eventually life flighted a second time to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center where he was in a stable, but critical condition. The standoff ended on Friday morning, September 27, 2013. A news conference was held at 10:30 AM on the 27th from the DuBois State Police Barracks. Officials announced that the suspect was killed in the early morning standoff which lasted 11 hours. The suspect was 60-year-old Kenneth Lees. Senior Officers tried multiple times to contact and reason with Lees, but they were all unsuccessful. Around 1 AM, police forces entered Lees' home to find that he was dead due a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Lees' son was also involved in an overnight chase with officers. Police wanted to contact the son to help talk with Kenneth, but when they attempted to pull over the vehicle, he fled. Officers were led on a 25-mile chase that ended with him fleeing through the woods. One officer was injured in the endeavor but officers did eventually catch up with the man who is now in jail under charges of fleeing from police and aggravated assault.

As of the 2010 census the population was 3,933. Founded in 1830, it is the county seat of Jefferson County History The area was initially settled in the late 1790s upon the arrival of brothers Joseph and Andrew Barnett, as well as their brother-in-law Samuel Scott, who together established the first settlement at the confluence of the Sandy Lick and Mill Creeks in the area now known as Port Barnett. The first non-Native American settler of the land within the eventual town limits was Moses Knapp, who built a log house at the confluence of North Fork Creek and Sandy Lick Creek (which form Redbank Creek) in 1801. Brookville's main source of economic development throughout the 19th century was the lumber industry. Brookville's many creeks and its connection to larger rivers (the Clarion to the north, which, like the Redbank, flows to the Allegheny) allowed for extensive construction of lumber mills along the watersheds and the floating of timber to markets in Pittsburgh. The town enjoyed great economic success during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, serving as home to several factories, breweries, an important railroad stop for local coal and timber, and briefly the Twyford Motor Car Company, which operated from 1905 to 1907 and produced the world's first four-wheel drive automobile.

Punxsutawney is known for its Groundhog Day celebration each February 2, during which thousands of attendees and international media outlets visit the town for an annual weather prediction by the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. The borough, located northeast of Pittsburgh and northwest of Altoona, was incorporated in 1850. With a population of 5,962 as of the 2010 census, Punxsutawney is the largest incorporated municipality in Jefferson County. History Shawnee wigwam villages once occupied this site on the Mahoning Creek. The first settlement that included non-indigenous people was in 1772, when Reverend John Ettwein, a Moravian Church missionary, arrived with a band of 241 Christianized Delaware Indians.Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State (Illustrated). Oxford University Press, 1940. University of Pennsylvania, Federal Works Agency. p. 568. Google Books.The WPA Guide to Pennsylvania: The Keystone State. Trinity University Press, 2013. p. 568. Google Books, & Amazon Kindle. Swarms of gnats plagued early settlers and their livestock for years, and are blamed for Ettwein's failure to establish a permanent settlement there. The clouds of biting gnats eventually drove the Indians away. The Indians called the insects ponkies (living dust and ashes), and called their village Ponkis Utenink (land of the ponkies), from which the present name Punxsutawney evolved. One legend about the origin of the term ponkies concerned an old Indian sorcerer-hermit who was said to have long terrorized Indians in the region. Eventually he was killed, his body burned, and his ashes were cast to the wind. According to the story, the ashes were transformed into minute living things that infested the swamp land.McKnight, William J., M.D. A Pioneer History of Jefferson County, Pennsylvania. J.B. Lippincott Company, 1898. Chapter: Sunday, July 19th. p. 235. Google Books.McKnight, William James. A Pioneer Outline History of Northwestern Pennsylvania (Illustrated). J.B. Lippincott Company, 1905. Donation Lands. Google Books. Another story about the source of the term asserted that the Indians compared the insect bites to burns caused by sparks or hot ashes. The area was originally settled by the Lenape (Delaware Native Americans), and a more definitive source says the name \\"Punxsutawney\\" derives from a Native name in Unami (a Lenape language): ', which translates to \\"town of the sandflies\\" or \\"town of the mosquitoes\\" ('- ‚Äòmosquito‚Äô + -' ‚Äòtown‚Äô). Alternatively, the name is said to come from another Unami term, ', which means \\"poison vine.\\"Brinton, Daniel G., C.F. Denke, and Albert Anthony. A Len√¢p√© - English Dictionary. Biblio Bazaar, 2009. , p. 121. The Shawnee and Delaware left Pennsylvania and had settled in Ohio by the end of the American Revolution. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Keystone Marker lists that Punxsutawney was founded in 1818. By 1840 it was reported that Punxsutawney was a village of about 15 or 20 dwellings. Settlers drawn by lumbering and coal mining eventually drained the swamps and exterminated the insects. The Borough of Punxsutawney was incorporated in 1850, and had a reported population of 256 at that time. In 1907, Punxsutawney and Claysville boroughs were consolidated and incorporated as Greater Punxsutawney, resulting in a combined population of 9,058 by 1910. A high-grade bituminous soft coal was mined in the surrounding region. Shortly after 1850, mining was being supplanted by factories which included brickworks, glassworks, tanneries, foundries, ironworks, machine shops, and wood planing, flour, feed, and silk mills. By the 1930s these were mostly gone, and townspeople were dependent largely on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad repair shops north of town, and a meat packing plant, in addition to the remaining coal mining and batteries of beehive coke ovens. In 1900, 6,746 people lived in Punxsutawney before the consolidation with Claysville. After consolidation, the population in 1910 was 9,058; in 1920, 10,311; in 1930, 9,266; prewar in 1940, 9,482; and postwar in 1950, 8,969 people lived there. The population was 5,962 at the 2010 census. A groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil is kept in the town, and is said to predict the weather annually on Groundhog Day (February 2). The event provided the premise for the 1993 film Groundhog Day, although nearly all of the film was shot in Woodstock, Illinois. The T. M. Kurtz House, Jefferson Theater, Christian Miller House, and United States Post Office-Punxsutawney are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Biography Butler, who was of Irish origin, was an indentured servant to Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore. At around 16 years of age she announced her intention to marry a man referred to only as \\"Negro Charles\\". A 1664 Maryland law outlined the legal status of a free woman who voluntarily married a slave: she would serve the master of her husband until his death, and any offspring of their union would be born into slavery. Despite this, Butler was determined to be wed. The thought of a white woman becoming a slave apparently distressed Lord Baltimore somewhat, and he warned against the union for that reason. Lord Baltimore petitioned Maryland's provincial assembly to change the 1664 law, and in 1681 key provisions of the law were in fact repealed. The new law additionally outlawed marriages between female servants and slaves, and provided for huge punitive fines to be levied on the master of any slave thus wed. Despite this, Butler and Charles apparently married in 1681, but before the law went into effect. Because the new law did not apply retroactively, and perhaps also because Lord Baltimore left Maryland indefinitely in 1684, Butler and Charles lived out the rest of their lives as the slaves of William Boarman, Eleanor Butler's husband's owner. They had seven or eight children, all born after the repeal of the 1664 law, but these were nonetheless born slaves. One son, Jack, apparently escaped and later bought his freedom from the Boarman family. The rest remained chattel. In October 1770, two of their descendants, William and Mary Butler, still enslaved, filed suit for their freedom on the basis they were descendants of a white woman. Mary Butler was Nell Butler's great granddaughter, but the provincial court ruled against them, noting that \\"many of these people, if turned loose, cannot mix with us and become members of society.\\" Other suits from other descendants followed in the 1780s. In 1787, the daughter of William and Mary Butler ‚Äì also named Mary ‚Äì successfully sued for her freedom, but hers was a procedural victory devoid of any particular precedent. While her attorney hoped that the court would decide that any descendant of a white woman could not be a slave, such a decision and the far-reaching effects it would have brought were not forthcoming. Instead, the court ruled that as no evidence existed of a legal union between Nell Butler and Negro Charles, the provisions of the 1664 law that condemned her and her offspring to slavery should not have applied in her case. This compromise ruling allowed Mary Butler her freedom without having any significant effect on property rights in the state.

Hon. Lady Eleanor Butler & Miss Ponsonby 'The Ladies of Llangollen' The \\"Ladies of Llangollen\\", Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, were two upper-class Irish women whose relationship scandalised and fascinated their contemporaries during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The pair moved to a Gothic mansion in Llangollen, North Wales, in 1780 after leaving Ireland to escape the social pressures of conventional marriages. Over the years, numerous distinguished visitors called upon them. Guests included Shelley, Byron, Wellington and Wordsworth, who wrote a sonnet about them. Throughout their lives, the two ladies dressed in men‚Äôs clothes leading to the assumption they were lesbians. However, research of their diaries and correspondents hint at no sexual relations, prompting some historians to conclude it was a Boston marriage, or platonic romance. Early lives Sarah Ponsonby and Lady Eleanor Butler in their library Portrait of Ladies of Llangollen 1819 Plas Newydd Eleanor Charlotte Butler (11 May 1739 ‚Äì 2 June 1829) was a member of the Butler family, the Earls (and later Dukes) of Ormond. Butler was considered an over-educated bookworm by her family, whose family seat was Kilkenny Castle. She was educated in a convent in France and so spoke French. Sarah Ponsonby (1755 ‚Äì 9 December 1831) lived with relatives in Woodstock, County Kilkenny. She was a second cousin of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, and thus a second cousin once removed of his daughter Lady Caroline Lamb. She was the daughter of Chambr√© Brabazon Ponsonby and Louisa Lyons. Their families lived 15 miles (25 km) from each other. The two women met in 1768, and quickly became close. Over the years they formulated a plan for a private rural retreat. It was their dream to live an unconventional life together. Welsh home Plas Newydd, near Llangollen, 1840 Rather than face the possibility of being forced into unwanted marriages, they left County Kilkenny together in April 1778. Their families hunted them down and forcefully tried to make them give up their plans‚Äîbut in vain. They moved to Wales and then sent for Sarah's servant, Mary Caryll, who lived with and worked for them for the rest of her life. Mary died first and they were buried in the same plot and share the same grave marker. Putting their plan into motion, they undertook a picturesque tour of the Welsh countryside, eventually settling in North Wales. Living first in a rented home in the village of Llangollen, they moved in 1780 to a small cottage just outside the village they called Plas Newydd or \\"new mansion\\". They proceeded to live according to their self-devised system, though they could rely on only a modest income from intolerant relatives, and eventually a civil list pension. They \\"improved\\" Plas Newydd in the Gothic style with Welsh oak panelling, pointed arches, stained glass windows, and an extensive library, in which they received their many guests. They hired a gardener, a footman and two maids. This led to significant debt, and they had to rely on the generosity of friends.  Recognition and popularity  They devoted their time to hosting a range of friends and curious visitors, extensive correspondence, private studies of literature and languages, and improving their estate. Over the years they added a circular stone dairy and created a sumptuous garden. Eleanor kept a diary of their activities. Llangollen people simply referred to them as \\"the ladies\\". After a couple of years, their life attracted the interest of the outside world. Their house became a haven for visitors travelling between Dublin and London, including writers such as Anna Seward, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott, but also the military leader the Duke of Wellington and the industrialist Josiah Wedgwood; aristocratic novelist Caroline Lamb, who was born a Ponsonby, came to visit too. Anne Lister from Yorkshire visited the couple, and was possibly inspired by their relationship to informally marry her own lover. Even travellers from continental Europe had heard of the couple and came to visit them, for instance Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, the German nobleman and landscape designer, wrote admiringly about them. The ladies were known throughout Britain, but have been said to have led \\"a rather unexciting life\\". Queen Charlotte wanted to see their cottage and persuaded King George III to grant them a pension. Eventually their families came to tolerate them. Personal lives Butler and Ponsonby lived together for 50 years. Their books and glassware carried both sets of initials and their letters were jointly signed. Towards the end of their lives, they both dressed in black riding habits and men's top hats; some visitors thought it was eccentric and outdated ‚Äì especially the hair powder ‚Äì but neighbours thought the clothes were practical for living outdoors. Rumours that they were in a sexual relationship floated around during and after their lives. In 1791, a magazine described them and implied that they were in a sexual relationship. According to Patricia Hampl, they were appalled by this idea, and objected to the magazine's characterisation to the point of consulting Edmund Burke over the possibility of suing the magazine for libel. In sharp contrast to the writings of their contemporary Anne Lister, there is nothing in their extensive correspondence or diaries that indicates a sexual relationship. Some consider Butler's and Ponsonby's relationship to be a Boston marriage, or a romantic relationship between two women who chose to live together and have \\"marriage- like relationships\\". Others conclude that the two had a non-sexual romantic friendship. Norena Shopland says that modern attitudes designed to distinguish same-sex relationships from a romantic friendship indicate they had a sexual relationship. According to Fiona Brideoake, the description of queer is more appropriate than the anachronistic and specific label of lesbian, particularly as queerness is a broad concept and significantly defined by its difference from typicality. Brideoake writes that their relationship was celebrated by other people as a form of mourning the relationships that they could not form. Coyle recounts that a \\"succession of their pet dogs were named 'Sappho'.\\" Deaths and legacy  Memorial in St Collen's graveyard Mary Caryll died on 22 November 1809. Eleanor Butler died on 2 June 1829 at the age of 90. Sarah Ponsonby died two years later on 9 December 1831, age 76. They are all buried together at St Collen's Church in Llangollen. Plas Newydd is now a museum run by Denbighshire County Council. Butler's Hill, near Plas Newydd, is named in honour of Eleanor Butler. The Ponsonby Arms public house, a Grade II listed building on Mill Street in Llangollen, claims to take its name from Sarah Ponsonby. In popular culture *Wordsworth wrote a sonnet about them, \\"To the Lady E.B and the Hon. Miss P\\". *Anna Seward wrote about them in her 1796 poem, ‚ÄúLlangollen Vale‚Äù, in which she associates them with \\"chaste provinciality\\". *The Ladies appeared in a \\"thinly-veiled biographical novel\\", Chase of the Wild Goose by pioneering female physician and author, Mary Gordon, originally published in 1936 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press. The book was reprinted and retitled The Llangollen Ladies: The Story of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby, Known as the Ladies of Llangollen. In the late 1800s, Gordon is said to have seen the Ladies' apparitions at Plas Newydd, which inspired her to learn about their lives. As Gordon recounts in the final section of the book, \\"The Ladies Meet Me,\\" she believed herself to be Butler and Ponsonby's \\"spiritual descendant,\\" and hailed them as the feminist progenitors of the modernist female scholars, professionals, and \\"friends who prefer to live together.\\" *The ladies' story (along with their ghost story) is told in a chapter of the 2009 book, Queer Hauntings: True Tales of Gay and Lesbian Ghosts by Ken Summers. *In April 2011, the same month in which the first Irish civil partnerships took place under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, Irish state broadcaster RT√â broadcast a 45-minute radio documentary about the lives of Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby entitled An Extraordinary Affair. It asked whether they were Ireland's first openly lesbian couple, but offered no evidence that their relationship was sexual. *In 2014, Llangollen, the Ladies and Plas Newydd were featured in the introductory sequence of the BBC property buying series Escape to the Country, series 22, episode 21, North Wales (available for online viewing in the U.S. via Netflix). *In February 2016, the Ladies of Llangollen were featured in a series 3 episode of Mysteries at the Castle broadcast in the United States on the Travel Channel. *In February 2020, the burial place and memorial of the Ladies were blessed at a special service for LGBT History Month at St Collen's Church, Llangollen. A tribute to the legacy of the Ladies was given in music by Ian Shaw (singer).

It is situated on the River Dee at the edge of the Berwyn range and the Dee Valley Way AONB. It had a population of 3,658 at the 2011 census. History Llangollen Bridge, 1793 Llangollen in 1850 Llangollen takes its name from the Welsh llan meaning \\"a religious settlement\\" and Saint Collen, a 6th-century monk who founded a church beside the river. St Collen is said to have arrived in Llangollen by coracle. There are no other churches in Wales dedicated to St Collen, and he may have had connections with Colan in Cornwall and with Langolen in Brittany. Above the town to the north is Castell Dinas Br√¢n, a stronghold of the Princes of Powys. Beyond the castle is the limestone escarpment known as the Eglwyseg Rocks. The outcrop continues north to World's End in Wrexham. The area nearest the castle is the Panorama Walk, and a monument to poet I.D. Hooson from the village of Rhosllannerchrugog can be found there. The ancient parish of Llangollen was divided into three traeanau (traean being the Welsh for \\"a third\\"): Llangollen Traean, Trefor Traean, and Glyn Traean. * Llangollen Traean contained the townships of Bachau, Cysylltau, Llangollen Abad, Llangollen Fawr, Llangollen Fechan, Feifod, Pengwern and Rhisgog. * Trefor Traean contained the townships of Cilmediw, Dinbren, Eglwysegl, Trefor Isaf and Trefor Uchaf. * Glyn Traean contained the townships of Cilcochwyn, Crogeniddon, Crogenwladus, Erwallo, Hafodgynfor, Nantygwryd, Pennant and Talygarth. Valle Crucis Abbey was established at Llantysilio in about 1201, under the patronage of Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor of Castell Dinas Br√¢n. The bridge at Llangollen was built across the Dee in the 16th century to replace a previous bridge built in about 1345 by John Trevor, of Trevor Hall (later Bishop of St Asaph), which replaced an even earlier bridge built in the reign of King Henry I. In the 1860s the present bridge was extended by adding an extra arch (to cross the new railway) and a two-storey stone tower with a castellated parapet. This became a caf√© before being demolished in the 1930s to improve traffic flow. The bridge was also widened in 1873 and again in 1968, using masonry which blended in with the older structure. It is a Grade I listed structure and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Plas Newydd (\\"New Mansion\\" or \\"New Place\\") on the outskirts of the town, was from 1780 the home of the Ladies of Llangollen; the Honourable Sarah Ponsonby, Lady Eleanor Butler and their maid Mary Carryl. They share the same grave memorial in the church. The Pillar of Eliseg is another old monument. Llangollen Community Hospital was completed in 1876. Governance There is an electoral ward of Denbighshire County Council of the same name. This ward includes Llantysilio community and has a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,079. Economy Today Llangollen relies heavily on the tourist industry, but still gains substantial income from farming. Most of the farms in the hills around the town were sheep farms, and the domestic wool industry, both spinning and weaving, was important in the area for centuries. Several factories were later built along the banks of the River Dee, where both wool and cotton were processed. The water mill opposite Llangollen railway station is over 600 years old, and was originally used to grind flour for local farmers. Culture In the late 19th century, Llangollen had a weekly newspaper, the Llangollen Advertiser. Llangollen hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1908. The Gorsedd ceremony was held on the Hermitage Field, next to Plas Newydd, and the circle of stones was later moved into the grounds of the hall. The eisteddfod itself took place on the old Vicarage Field at Fronhyfryd and was visited by David Lloyd George, accompanied by Winston Churchill. Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod The annual Llangollen International Eisteddfod is a large international music festival. It starts on a Tuesday and ends on the following Sunday. It opens with a parade led by the Llangollen Silver Band, in which both locals and visitors take part in dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments.Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod Llangollen Fringe Festival The Llangollen Fringe Festival is an independent arts festival, usually held in mid July in the town hall. The Fringe includes music, comedy, theatre, dance and workshops. Artists who have taken part in the Llangollen Fringe include Clement Freud, Rhys Ifans, the Damned, Cerys Matthews, Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Juan Mart√≠n, the Black Seeds, John Cooper Clarke, Will Self, Gang of Four, Lee Scratch Perry and Victoria Coren MitchellLlangollen Fringe Festival Dee Rocks Dee Rocks is a local fundraising music festival, usually held during May when the town hall is transformed into a music venue. The inaugural event took place on 29 May 2004, and the now annual fixture raises in excess of ¬£12,000 for local good causes . Songs and nursery rhymes * \\"Llangollen Market\\", traditional * \\"Ladies of Llangollen\\", Ian Chesterman * \\"Pastai Fawr Llangollen\\" (The Great Llangollen Pie), Arfon Gwilym * According to an anonymous rhyme, the bridge over the Dee is one of the Seven Wonders of Wales. * The nursery rhyme \\"Mary had a little lamb\\" is frequently, but incorrectly, linked with Llangollen. Its true origins are in the United States: \\"This is a lovely folklore story, but sadly Mary Thomas of Llangollen was not the heroine of the nursery rhyme ... The Mary of the rhyme was Mary Sawyer and the school was the Redstone Schoolhouse in Sterling Massachusetts, U.S.A.\\" Transport River Dee and Llangollen Railway Llangollen was an important coaching stop for the mail coach on the old mail route which is now the A5 from London to Holyhead. Buses Various buses serve the town, including buses to Wrexham, Barmouth and the Ceiriog Valley. National Express Coaches operate through the town on route 418, with journeys to Wrexham and to London via Shrewsbury, Telford and Birmingham. Railways The railway, operating both passenger and goods services, was extended from Ruabon, via Acrefair and Trevor, to reach Llangollen by 1865. The Ruabon to Barmouth Line became part of the Great Western Railway. However under the Beeching Axe of 1964, the line closed to passengers in early 1965, and to freight in April 1969.Lawton, p.20 The line was lifted in May 1969.Lawton, p.21 However, a 10-mile stretch of the line has been restored between Llangollen and Corwen and operates as the Llangollen Railway, a tourist attraction. In 2002, the Rainhill locomotive trials were re-staged on the line. Waterways The Ellesmere Canal was intended to connect the coal mines and ironworks at Ruabon and Wrexham to the canal network and thence to the sea via the River Mersey and the River Severn. The plans were altered, and instead of connecting Trevor northwards to the sea via the River Dee and southwards to the Severn, the canal ran eastwards to join the national network at Hurleston Junction on the Shropshire Union Canal near Nantwich. A feeder canal, navigable to Llangollen, was constructed from Trevor to tap water from the River Dee at Llantysilio (at the weir called \\"Horseshoe Falls\\"). After company mergers, the canal became part of the Shropshire Union System. Until recently it was properly called the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal, though it is now known as the Llangollen Canal. The canal supplied enough Dee water to supply Crewe and Nantwich, and when commercial traffic failed in the 1940s, it was its function as a water supply which kept it open. The canal is unusual amongst Britain's artificial waterways in having a strong flow (up to 2 miles per hour). Since the use of canals for leisure took off in the 1970s and 1980s, the route, twisting through Welsh hills and across the Dee Valley on the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, is an important part of Llangollen's attraction as a holiday destination. A marina, built at the end of the navigable section, allows summer visitors to moor overnight in Llangollen. Sport Llangollen on the River Dee hosts white water Slalom canoeing and kayaking, being host to International and UK events. The International Canoe Federation (ICF), the European Canoe Union (ECU) and the British Canoe Union (BCU) all hold events in Llangollen. Cricket,Llangollen Cricket Club football and rugby union teams play at Tower Fields, which overlooks the town and the International Eisteddfod field and pavilion. Thermals rising up the valley sides to the south of the town are used for paragliding. Mountain bikers enjoy the hills. Llangollen was the starting point of the first massed-start cycle race held on British roads, on 7 June 1942. The 59-mile Llangollen Wolverhampton race was organised by Percy Stallard in defiance of the sport's governing body, the National Cyclists' Union, but with approval from all police chief constables through whose districts the event ran.

The abbey was founded in 1164. is a Latinisation of the Welsh ; 'Valley of Flowers'; the Welsh word is synonymous with strath and dale, while (\\"flower\\") is also the name of the nearby river.Founding of Strata Florida After the region around St Davids was firmly occupied by the Norman Marcher lordship of Pembroke by the early 12th century, with St Davids firmly under Norman influence thereafter, the princely Dinefwr family of Deheubarth transferred their patronage to Strata Florida, and interred many of their family members there. History= Foundation  The Monastery was founded in 1164 by the Cambro-Norman Knight Robert FitzStephen (c 1123‚Äî1183). In the 12th century, Cistercian monks from Whitland Abbey, Narbeth, Carmarthenshire started to construct a religious settlement on the banks of the Afon Fflur (from which the present Abbey takes its name), a short distance from the present site. This was at a time of fast expansion of the Cistercian order. The site of this first settlement is known as Hen Fynachlog (the Old Monastery). Around 1164 the Abbey of Strata Florida was founded through the patronage of Rhys ap Gruffydd. In 1184, a further charter was issued by Lord Rhys, reaffirming Strata Florida as a monastery under the patronage of Deheubarth, a principality of South Wales. Several descendants of the Lord Rhys have been buried at this Abbey, including 11 princes of the Welsh royal house of Dinefwr of Deheubarth during the 12th and 13th centuries Notable burials include Prince Gruffydd ap Rhys II and poet Dafydd ap Gwilym. The church was consecrated in 1201. Medieval period Strata Florida became an important and powerful religious centre. Around 1238, Prince Llywelyn ap Iorwerth held a council at Strata Florida. It was here that he made the other Welsh leaders acknowledge his son Dafydd as his rightful successor. Strata Florida controlled many farms throughout Wales; these \\"granges\\" provided the monastery with food and income. The most important primary historical source for early Welsh history, the Brut y Tywysogion, was compiled at Strata Florida. In 1401, during the early years of Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion, Strata Florida Abbey was taken by King Henry IV and his son. The monks were deemed to be sympathetic to Glynd≈µr, so they were evicted from the monastery, which was plundered. Henry IV turned the religious buildings into a military base as he planned to capture or defeat any Welsh rebel forces active in the area. By 1402 the Earl of Worcester held the Abbey for the English Crown with a garrison of several hundred men-at-arms, archers and foot soldiers. It continued to be used as a military base for further campaigns against the Welsh rebels in 1407 and 1415. The monastic site was returned to the Cistercians with the end of the Glynd≈µr rebellion.  Dissolution  Beginning in 1539, Henry VIII used his dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church in Rome to dissolve and sack the monasteries of England and Wales. Strata Florida Abbey was dissolved in 1539 by church commissioners. The buildings and their contents were valued and then sold off. The church and most of the ancillary buildings were demolished for building materials such as the window glass and stone as well as the roof tiles and lead. However, the refectory and dormitory were rebuilt as Ty Abaty, a house for the local gentry. The property has been owned by a number of notable families including the Steadmans and the Powells of Nanteos. Much of the former monastic lands of the Cistercian abbey at Strata Florida were given to Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex who sold them on to Sir John Vaughan, of Trawsgoed. Through his marriage to Jane Stedman, daughter of John Stedman of Ystrad Fflur and Cilcennin, he gained more land on which to create the large Trawsgoed estate.Trawsgoed Estate The present parish church of St. Mary, within the boundaries of the graveyard, may have been built with stone taken from the monastic site.  Abandonment  The remains of Strata Florida Abbey as depicted in the 1851 Illustrated London Reading Book Following its dissolution, the site of Strata Florida Abbey was left to deteriorate. It was not until the coming of the railways in the late 19th century that interest in the site was rekindled. Stephen Williams, a railway engineer, was surveying a possible route through the area when he took an interest in the ruins. As Williams was a founder member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, he invited the group to the site in 1848. Following this visit the Association leased the Abbey site in order to create better displays and presentations to the public. Williams, who was to become a leading expert on the archaeology of the Cistercian Order, was placed in charge of excavations. Over the next few years, he removed huge amounts of spoil, to uncover the majority of remains that are still on view today. Interest in the ruins brought in wealthy Victorians by railway. , a principal station on the Carmarthen Aberystwyth Line, was named after the Abbey. About the Abbey the 1851 Illustrated London Reading Book says: :The remains of Strata Florida Abbey, in South Wales, are most interesting in many points of view, more especially as the relics of a stately seminary for learning, founded as early as 1164. The community of the Abbey were Cistercian monks, who soon attained great celebrity, and acquired extensive possessions. They founded a large library that included national records from the earliest periods, works of the bards, and genealogies of the Princes and great families in Wales. The monks also compiled a valuable history of the Principality, down to the death of Llewellyn the Great. When Edward I invaded Wales, he burned the Abbey, but it was rebuilt A.D. 1294. :Extensive woods once flourished in the vicinity of Strata Florida, and its burial-place covered no less than . A long list of eminent persons from all parts of Wales were buried, and amongst them Dafydd ap Gwilym, the famous bard. The churchyard is now reduced to small dimensions; but leaden coffins, doubtless belonging to once celebrated personages, are still found, both there and at a distance from the cemetery. Only a few aged box and yew-trees now remain to tell of the luxuriant verdure that once grew around the Abbey. Of the venerable pile itself, little is left, except an arch, and the fragment of a fine old wall, about forty feet high. A small church now stands within the enclosure, more than commonly interesting from having been built with the materials of the once celebrated Abbey of Strata Florida.  Current status  Excavation of the 'gatehouse' 2008 An excavated mediaeval floor tile. The site was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1919 and is now in the care of Cadw. It has a variety of ruins. The only substantive structure remaining of the monastery is the main entrance archway. The Great West Door to the Abbey Church has low walls marking the extent of the church and its six subsidiary chapels. A modern roof protects an area of excavated work medieval tiling. The small on-site museum has some of these tiles on display. One of the best-known is one depicting a medieval gentleman admiring himself in a mirror. The graveyard next to the Abbey ruins is still used for burials. A memorial to the Welsh language poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym, who is interred here is next to an ancient yew tree. A stone memorial in the Chapter House commemorates the princes who are buried at Strata Florida. It is a replica; the original is housed in the site's small museum.  Archaeological research  Geophysical surveys by the University of Wales, Lampeter and its successor University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, have found several large structures. These include what is thought to be possibly the gatehouse to the Abbey's inner precincts. There is no definitive evidence for a kiln that made tiles for the Abbey to be found in the surrounding woods. Excavations of the possible gatehouse have revealed a number of medieval pottery tile sherds, indicating that the building may have also housed a chapel, possibly over the entrance way. The building was later reused as a residence and possibly as agricultural buildings. At some point a substantial frontage was built over the original gateway road to create space between the two flanking buildings. The structure then fell into disrepair and was lost. A number of field boundaries have also been identified. Two leats that may have increased water flow into the Nant Glasffrwd were studied. It is believed they were used to run a mill further downstream. Iron working slag was discovered within the monastic precincts. , the excavations at Strata Florida are ongoing.

Talley Abbey ruins.Talley Abbey () is a ruined former monastery of the Premonstratensians (\\"White Canons\\") in the village of Talley in Carmarthenshire, Wales, six miles (10 km) north of the market town of Llandeilo. It lies in the River Cothi valley. Access to the site of the abbey is free, and the site is maintained by Cadw. History The Order was founded in 1120. In 1126, when it received papal approbation by Pope Honorius II, there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. They came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in Lincoln, and before the dissolution under Henry VIII there were 35 houses. Soon after their arrival in England, they founded Dryburgh Abbey in the Borders area of Scotland, which was followed by other communities at Whithorn Priory, Dercongal Abbey and Tongland Abbey all in the Borders area, as well as Fearn Abbey in Ross. Description The monastery, which was founded by Rhys ap Gruffydd in or about 1185, is in the care of Cadw. In common with Strata Florida Abbey, it was once claimed to be the site of the grave of the medieval Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, but this is one of the discredited theories of Iolo Morganwg. There are two lakes near the abbey ruins, which was used for fish farming to support the community of monks. The abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII and the structure mined by the villagers for stone to build much of the present village and the chapel next to the abbey. The ruinous tower is surrounded by steep wooded hills, and it can be reached by a circuitous lane from the main road. It is well signposted.

Declarer uses safety plays to cope with potentially unfavorable layouts of the opponent's cards. In so doing, declarer attempts to ensure the contract even in worst-case scenarios, by giving up the possibility of overtricks. Safety plays adapt declarer's strategy to the scoring system. In IMP-scoring tournaments and rubber bridge, the primary scoring reward comes from fulfilling the contract and overtricks are of little marginal value. Therefore, safety plays are an important part of declarer technique at quantitative scoring. In matchpoint games, which use comparative scoring, overtricks are very important. Therefore, although safety plays have a certain role at matchpoints, they are normally avoided if the odds for making the contract are good and overtricks are likely. Definition The term safety play is difficult to define crisply. The Bridge World glossaryThe Bridge World glossary defines safety play as \\"the surest line to make the contract, disregarding extra tricks that might be made in some other way.\\" Marshall MilesMiles, Marshall. How to Win at Duplicate Bridge. Collier, 1957. has defined it as \\"playing in such a way as to lose a trick with average breaks in order to avoid losing additional tricks with bad breaks.\\" Conflating discussions from various sources yields the following points, each descriptive of safety play characteristics: *A safety play is made in a single suit. In the context of that suit, it can often be described using other terms that might or might not pertain to the full deal, such as avoidance play, percentage play, coup or duck. *A safety play, although made in a single suit, is intended to maximize declarer's chances to make the contract. *A safety play usually gives up the opportunity to win as many tricks as possible in a particular suit in order to gain an advantage on the full deal. It therefore is sometimes compared to an insurance premium. Examples Safety plays have a role at both comparative scoring and quantitative scoring, although they are used more often at quantitative scoring because they tend to give up on overtricks. Safety play at IMPs The example deal at leftKelsey, H.W. Test Your Match Play. Faber, 1977. is from a team of four game. South plays 6NT against the lead of the 10. Dummy's K wins, and the A and K are played. East discards a small spade on the second club trick. This particular hand is one of a relatively small group of (non- trivial) deals in which perfect safety is available after the third trick. Single-dummy, using a safety play in diamonds, it is possible to guarantee the contract against any remaining distribution and play of the E-W cards. South started by expecting to win five clubs, one or two diamonds, four hearts and two spades, but the 4-1 split in clubs complicates matters. Still, a safety play in diamonds will bring in twelve tricks. It's just coincidence, but the proper diamond play on this hand is the same as the percentage play with this diamond holding, considering the suit in isolation. The best play for three diamond tricks is to play the A, and then lead toward either the Q or the J. This play brings in three diamond tricks 73% of the time. Using that play on this deal brings in twelve tricks 100% of the time. Cash the A, and lead small toward the Q. Then: *If diamonds are 3-2, South will always win three clubs, three diamonds, four hearts and two spades. *If diamonds are 4-1 and West has the singleton, East cannot play the K on the second lead without setting up both the Q and the J. If East plays low and West shows out, concede a club and take four clubs, two diamonds, four hearts and two spades. The same play works if East began with five diamonds. *If diamonds are 4-1 and East has the singleton, West can capture the Q with the K. But in that case West is known to hold four cards in each minor, and on the run of the major suits will be squeezed out of his guard in either diamonds or clubs. In with the K, West can attack dummy's entry in diamonds or in clubs, but not both. The same play works if West began with five diamonds. Note that South gives up the 14% chance of four diamond tricks (finessing the J and then cashing the A, hoping for the K onside and doubleton) in exchange for insuring the contract against any diamond break. If South begins the diamonds by finessing the J, the contract fails against king-fourth in the East hand. Safety play at matchpoints Safety play usually involves giving up the chance of the maximum result in exchange for the best chance of making the contract. So one seldom sees safety plays made at matchpoints or board-a-match. But even at those forms of scoring, there can be good reasons to make safety plays. Suppose that, at pairs, declarer is in a standard contract, one that the majority of the field will surely reach. However, the defense makes an unorthodox opening lead, presenting declarer with a possible overtrick. There may now be a way, unavailable to other declarers, that will guarantee the contract while retaining good chances for the overtrick. Or declarer might be in an unusually good contract. Hugh KelseyKelsey, H.W. Match-Point Bridge. Faber, 1970. gives this example: The bidding goes 1 -- 2; Pass, and West leads the K and continues with the 10. South is in an unusually good matchpoint contract. Most players will open the South hand with 1NT rather than 1. And it is very difficult to reach a heart contract if South opens 1NT or 1: either way, North signs off in diamonds. In any case, 2 is both an exceptionally good matchpoint contract and difficult to reach. Assuming reasonably competent defense, plus 130 is the limit playing in diamonds, and plus 120 in notrump contracts. But there's an easy way to score plus 140 in 2: take a safety play in hearts by ducking the first round. This gives up the chance of plus 170 (if hearts break 3-3) in exchange for the best chance of plus 140 (if hearts break either 4-2 or 3-3). Note that playing hearts from the top leads to defeat if hearts are 4-2, the most likely split. Safety play at notrump Safety plays, of course, are not limited to trump contracts. Here is an example of a safety play at notrump. South declares 3NT and gets the lead of the Q. After winning the A, declarer leads the 2 and East plays a small spade. The play of the 9 now assures the contract. If West wins the trick he cannot play another heart without giving the ninth trick to declarer and the tempo to develop more in spades. West therefore switches to a diamond and South wins in hand. South overtakes the K with the A ‚Äì the key play on this hand ‚Äì and the A assures an entry to two more spade tricks. If spades are played from top the hand might not make if East holds Q J x x and both minor suits fail to break.

He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic folk music to create an original, modern musical style.Sehnal and Vyslou≈æil (2001), p. 175 Until 1895 he devoted himself mainly to folkloristic research. While his early musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, his later, mature works incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music in a modern, highly original synthesis, first evident in the opera Jen≈Øfa, which was premiered in 1904 in Brno.Sehnal and Vyslou≈æil (2001), p. 183 The success of Jen≈Øfa (often called the \\"Moravian national opera\\") at Prague in 1916 gave Jan√°ƒçek access to the world's great opera stages.Sehnal and Vyslou≈æil (2001), p. 184 Sehnal and Vyslou≈æil (2001), p. 185 Jan√°ƒçek's later works are his most celebrated. They include operas such as K√°≈•a Kabanov√° and The Cunning Little Vixen, the Sinfonietta, the Glagolitic Mass, the rhapsody Taras Bulba, two string quartets, and other chamber works. Along with Dvo≈ô√°k and Bed≈ôich Smetana, he is considered one of the most important Czech composers.ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω hudebn√≠ slovn√≠k osob a instituc√≠ I.

His father wanted him to follow the family tradition and become a teacher, but he deferred to Jan√°ƒçek's obvious musical abilities. In 1865, young Jan√°ƒçek enrolled as a ward of the foundation of the Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno, where he took part in choral singing under Pavel K≈ô√≠≈ækovsk√Ω and occasionally played the organ. One of his classmates, Franti≈°ek Neumann, later described Jan√°ƒçek as an \\"excellent pianist, who played Beethoven symphonies perfectly in a piano duet with a classmate, under K≈ô√≠≈ækovsk√Ω's supervision\\".≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 24 K≈ô√≠≈ækovsk√Ω found him a problematic and wayward student but recommended his entry to the Prague Organ School.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 29 Jan√°ƒçek later remembered K≈ô√≠≈ækovsk√Ω as a great conductor and teacher. Jan√°ƒçek originally intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873‚Äì76).Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 13 In 1874, he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under Franti≈°ek Skuhersk√Ω and Franti≈°ek Bla≈æek.ƒåernu≈°√°k (1963), p. 557 His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, he had to make do with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 32 His criticism of Skuhersk√Ω's performance of the Gregorian mass was published in the March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school, but Skuhersk√Ω relented, and on 24 July 1875 Jan√°ƒçek graduated with the best results in his class.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 31 On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzov√°, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Jan√°ƒçek's wife. In 1876, he also became a piano student of Am√°lie Wickenhauserov√°-Nerudov√°, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brnƒõnsk√° Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 19 From October 1879 to February 1880, he studied piano, organ, and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory. While there, he composed Thema con variazioni for piano in B flat, subtitled Zdenka's Variations.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 27Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 29 Dissatisfied with his teachers (among them Oscar Paul and Leo Grill), and denied a studentship with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns in Paris, Jan√°ƒçek moved on to the Vienna Conservatory, where from April to June 1880, he studied composition with Franz Krenn.Firku≈°n√Ω (2005), p. 45 He concealed his opposition to Krenn's neo- romanticism, but he quit Josef Dachs's classes and further piano study when he was criticised for his piano style and technique.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 55 He submitted a violin sonata (now lost) to a Vienna Conservatory competition, but the judges rejected it as \\"too academic\\".≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 57 Jan√°ƒçek left the conservatory in June 1880, disappointed despite Franz Krenn's very complimentary personal report.Firku≈°n√Ω (2005), p. 48 He returned to BrnoDrl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 31 where on 13 July 1881, he married his young pupil Zdenka Schulzov√°.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 33 Former organ school in Brno. Jan√°ƒçek lived in a small house in the garden of the villa. His garden house is today's Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek Memorial. In 1881, Jan√°ƒçek founded and was appointed director of the organ school, and held this post until 1919, when the school became the Brno Conservatory. In the mid-1880s, Jan√°ƒçek began composing more systematically. Among other works, he created the Four male-voice choruses (1886), dedicated to Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, and his first opera, ≈†√°rka (1887‚Äì88).Vyslou≈æil, p. 224 During this period he began to collect and study folk music, songs and dances. In the early months of 1887, he sharply criticized the comic opera The Bridegrooms, by Czech composer Karel Kova≈ôovic, in a Hudebn√≠ listy journal review: \\"Which melody stuck in your mind? Which motif? Is this dramatic opera? No, I would write on the poster: 'Comedy performed together with music', since the music and the libretto aren't connected to each other\\".≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), pp. 111‚Äì12 Jan√°ƒçek's review apparently led to mutual dislike and later professional difficulties when Kova≈ôovic, as director of the National Theatre in Prague, refused to stage Jan√°ƒçek's opera Jen≈Øfa.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 112 Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 41 From the early 1890s, Jan√°ƒçek led the mainstream of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia, using a repertoire of folk songs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements. Most of his achievements in this field were published in 1899‚Äì1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong.Jan√°ƒçkovy z√°znamy hudebn√≠ho a taneƒçn√≠ho folkloru, p. 380 His compositional work was still influenced by the declamatory, dramatic style of Smetana and Dvo≈ô√°k. He expressed very negative opinions on German neo-classicism and especially on Wagner in the Hudebn√≠ listy journal, which he founded in 1884.Firku≈°n√Ω (2005), p. 62 The death of his second child, Vladim√≠r, in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera, Beginning of the Romance (1891) and the cantata Amarus (1897).  Later years and masterworks  In the first decade of the 20th century, Jan√°ƒçek composed choral church music including Otƒçen√°≈° (Our Father, 1901), Constitutes (1903) and Ave Maria (1904). In 1901, the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published and gradually became one of his most frequently-performed works.Zahr√°dka, Ji≈ô√≠ (2006), p. XI In 1902, Jan√°ƒçek visited Russia twice. On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to St. Petersburg, where she stayed to study Russian. Only three months later, he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga had become very ill. They took her back to Brno, but her health worsened. Jan√°ƒçek expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work, his opera Jen≈Øfa, in which the suffering of his daughter had transfigured into Jen≈Øfa's. When Olga died in February 1903, Jan√°ƒçek dedicated Jen≈Øfa to her memory. The opera was performed in Brno in 1904, with reasonable success, but Jan√°ƒçek felt this was no more than a provincial achievement. He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera, but Jen≈Øfa was refused there (twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague). Dejected and emotionally exhausted, Jan√°ƒçek went to Luhaƒçovice spa to recover. There he met Kamila Urv√°lkov√°, whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera, Osud (Destiny). The only preserved page of the autograph manuscript of Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa In 1905, Jan√°ƒçek attended a demonstration in support of a Czech university in Brno, where the violent death of Franti≈°ek Pavl√≠k, a young joiner, at the hands of the police inspired his piano sonata, 1. X. 1905 (From The Street).Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 67 The incident led him to further promote the anti-German and anti-Austrian ethos of the Russian Circle, which he had co-founded in 1897ƒåernu≈°√°k (1963), p. 558 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 81 In 1906, he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruƒç, with whom he later collaborated, composing several choral works based on Bezruƒç's poetry. These included Kantor Halfar (1906), Maryƒçka Magd√≥nova (1908), and Sedmdes√°t tis√≠c (1909). Jan√°ƒçek's life in the first decade of the 20th century was complicated by personal and professional difficulties. He still yearned for artistic recognition from Prague.Vyslou≈æil, p. 225 He destroyed some of his works, others remained unfinished. Nevertheless, he continued composing, and would create several remarkable choral, chamber, orchestral and operatic works, the most notable being the 1914 cantata, Vƒõƒçn√© evangelium (The Eternal Gospel), Poh√°dka (Fairy tale) for cello and piano (1910), the 1912 piano cycle V mlh√°ch (In the Mists) and his first symphonic poem ≈†uma≈ôovo d√≠tƒõ (A Fiddler's Child). His fifth opera, V√Ωlet pana Brouƒçka do mƒõs√≠ce, composed from 1908 to 1917, has been characterized as the most \\"purely Czech in subject and treatment\\" of all of Jan√°ƒçek's operas. In 1916, he started a long professional and personal relationship with theatre critic, dramatist and translator Max Brod.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 83C Susskind, Jan√°ƒçek and Brod. Yale University Press, 1985, In the same year, Jen≈Øfa, revised by Kova≈ôovic, was finally accepted by the National Theatre. Its performance in Prague in 1916 was a great success, and brought Jan√°ƒçek his first acclaim. He was 62. Following the Prague premi√®re, he began a relationship with singer Gabriela Horv√°thov√°, which led to his wife Zdenka's attempted suicide and their \\"informal\\" divorce.Thema con variazioni, p. 8 A year later (1917), he met Kamila St√∂sslov√°, a young married woman 38 years his junior, who was to inspire him for the remaining years of his life. He conducted an obsessive and (on his side at least) passionate correspondence with her, of nearly 730 letters.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 99 From 1917 to 1919, deeply inspired by St√∂sslov√°, he composed The Diary of One Who Disappeared. As he completed its final revision, he began his next 'Kamila' work, the opera K√°≈•a Kabanov√°. Kamila St√∂sslov√° with her son Otto in 1917 In 1920, Jan√°ƒçek retired from his post as director of the Brno Conservatory but continued to teach until 1925.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 91 In 1921, he attended a lecture by the Indian philosopher-poet Rabindranath Tagore and used a Tagore poem as the basis for the chorus The Wandering Madman (1922). At the same time, he encountered the microtonal works of Alois H√°ba. In the early 1920s, Jan√°ƒçek completed his opera The Cunning Little Vixen, which had been inspired by a serialized novella in the newspaper Lidov√© noviny. In Jan√°ƒçek's 70th year (1924), his biography was published by Max Brod, and he was interviewed by Olin Downes for The New York Times. In 1925, he retired from teaching but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno. In the spring of 1926, he created his Sinfonietta, a monumental orchestral work, which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim. In the same year, he went to England at the invitation of Rosa Newmarch. A number of his works were performed in London, including his first string quartet, the wind sextet Youth, and his violin sonata.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 109 Shortly after, and still in 1926, he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text. The result was the large-scale orchestral Glagolitic Mass. Jan√°ƒçek was an atheist, and critical of the organized Church, but religious themes appear frequently in his work. [dead link][dead link] The Glagolitic Mass was partly inspired by the suggestion by a clerical friend and partly by Jan√°ƒçek's wish to celebrate the anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. Jan√°ƒçek's grave, in Brno In 1927 ‚Äì the year of the Sinfonietta's first performances in New York, Berlin and Brno ‚Äì he began to compose his final operatic work, From the House of the Dead, the third Act of which was found on his desk after his death. In January 1928, he began his second string quartet, the Intimate Letters, his \\"manifesto on love\\". Meanwhile, the Sinfonietta was performed in London, Vienna and Dresden. In his later years, Jan√°ƒçek became an international celebrity. He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1927, along with Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 113Vyslou≈æil, p. 227 His operas and other works were finally performed at the world stages. In August 1928, he took an excursion to ≈†tramberk with Kamila St√∂sslov√° and her son Otto but caught a chill, which developed into pneumonia. He died on 12 August 1928 in Ostrava, at the sanatorium of Dr. L. Klein, at the age of 74. He was given a large public funeral that included music from the last scene of his Cunning Little Vixen. He was buried in the Field of Honour at the Central Cemetery, Brno.Drl√≠kov√° (2004), p. 119  Personality  Olga Jan√°ƒçkov√° Jan√°ƒçek worked tirelessly throughout his life. He led the organ school, was a Professor at the teachers institute and gymnasium in Brno, collected his \\"speech tunes\\" and was composing. From an early age, he presented himself as an individualist and his firmly formulated opinions often led to conflict. He unhesitatingly criticized his teachers, who considered him a defiant and anti-authoritarian student, yet his own students found him to be strict and uncompromising. Vil√©m Tausk√Ω, one of his pupils, described his encounters with Jan√°ƒçek as somewhat distressing for someone unused to his personality and noted that Jan√°ƒçek's characteristically staccato speech rhythms were reproduced in some of his operatic characters.Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), p. 16 In 1881, Jan√°ƒçek gave up his leading role with the Beseda brnƒõnsk√°, as a response to criticism, but a rapid decline in Beseda's performance quality led to his recall in 1882.Firku≈°n√Ω (2005), p. 57 His married life, settled and calm in its early years, became increasingly tense and difficult following the death of his daughter, Olga, in 1903. Years of effort in obscurity took their toll, and almost ended his ambitions as a composer: \\"I was beaten down\\", he wrote later, \\"My own students gave me advice ‚Äì how to compose, how to speak through the orchestra\\".P≈ôib√°≈àov√° (2007), p. 8 Success in 1916 ‚Äì when Karel Kova≈ôovic finally decided to perform Jen≈Øfa in Prague ‚Äì brought its own problems. Jan√°ƒçek grudgingly resigned himself to the changes forced upon his work. Its success brought him into Prague's music scene and the attentions of soprano Gabriela Horv√°tov√°, who guided him through Prague society. Jan√°ƒçek was enchanted by her. On his return to Brno, he appears not to have concealed his new passion from Zdenka, who responded by attempting suicide. Jan√°ƒçek was furious with Zdenka and tried to instigate a divorce, but lost interest in Horv√°tov√°. Zdenka, anxious to avoid the public scandal of formal divorce, persuaded him to settle for an \\"informal\\" divorce. From then on, until Jan√°ƒçek's death, they lived separate lives in the same household. In 1917, he began his lifelong, inspirational and unrequited passion for Kamila St√∂sslov√°, who neither sought nor rejected his devotion.P≈ôib√°≈àov√° (2007), p. 9 Jan√°ƒçek pleaded for first-name terms in their correspondence. In 1927, she finally agreed and signed herself \\"Tv√° Kamila\\" (Your Kamila) in a letter, which Zdenka found. This revelation provoked a furious quarrel between Zdenka and Jan√°ƒçek, though their living arrangements did not change ‚Äì Jan√°ƒçek seems to have persuaded her to stay. In 1928, the year of his death, Jan√°ƒçek confessed his intention to publicize his feelings for St√∂sslov√°. Max Brod had to dissuade him.P≈ôib√°≈àov√° (2007), p. 10 Jan√°ƒçek's contemporaries and collaborators described him as mistrustful and reserved, but capable of obsessive passion for those he loved. His overwhelming passion for St√∂sslov√° was sincere but verged upon self-destruction. Their letters remain an important source for Jan√°ƒçek's artistic intentions and inspiration. His letters to his long- suffering wife are, by contrast, mundanely descriptive. Zdenka seems to have destroyed all hers to Jan√°ƒçek. Only a few postcards survive.  Style  In 1874, Jan√°ƒçek became friends with Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, and began composing in a relatively traditional Romantic style. After his opera ≈†√°rka (1887‚Äì1888), his style absorbed elements of Moravian and Slovak folk music. His musical assimilation of the rhythm, pitch contour and inflections of normal Czech speech (Moravian dialect) helped create the very distinctive vocal melodies of his opera Jen≈Øfa (1904), whose 1916 success in Prague was to be the turning point in his career. In Jen≈Øfa, Jan√°ƒçek developed and applied the concept of \\"speech tunes\\" to build a unique musical and dramatic style quite independent of \\"Wagnerian\\" dramatic method. He studied the circumstances in which \\"speech tunes\\" changed, the psychology and temperament of speakers and the coherence within speech, all of which helped render the dramatically truthful roles of his mature operas, and became one of the most significant markers of his style.Firku≈°n√Ω (2005), pp. 91‚Äì92 Jan√°ƒçek took these stylistic principles much farther in his vocal writing than Modest Mussorgsky, and thus anticipates the later work of B√©la Bart√≥k.Samson 1977 The stylistic basis for his later works originates in the period of 1904‚Äì1918, but Jan√°ƒçek composed most of his output ‚Äì and his best known works ‚Äì in the last decade of his life. Much of Jan√°ƒçek's work displays great originality and individuality. It employs a vastly expanded view of tonality, uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures, and often, modality: \\"there is no music without key. Atonality abolishes definite key, and thus tonal modulation.... Folksong knows of no atonality.\\"Hollander 1963 Jan√°ƒçek features accompaniment figures and patterns, with (according to Jim Samson) \\"the on-going movement of his music...similarly achieved by unorthodox means; often a discourse of short, 'unfinished' phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner.\\" Jan√°ƒçek named these motifs \\"sƒçasovka\\" in his theoretical works. \\"Sƒçasovka\\" has no strict English equivalent, but John Tyrrell, a leading specialist on Jan√°ƒçek's music, describes it as \\"a little flash of time, almost a kind of musical capsule, which Jan√°ƒçek often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms that are supposed to pepper the musical flow.\\"Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), p. 13 Jan√°ƒçek's use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers (Sir Charles Mackerras called Jan√°ƒçek \\"the first minimalist composer\\").  Inspiration = Folklore  Jan√°ƒçek was deeply influenced by folklore, and by Moravian folk music in particular, but not by the pervasive, idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant. He took a realistic, descriptive and analytic approach to the material. Moravian folk songs, compared with their Bohemian counterparts, are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure, and more varied in their melodic intervals.Zemanov√° (2002), p. 61 In his study of Moravian modes, Jan√°ƒçek found that the peasant musicians did not know the names of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them. He considered their Moravian modulation, as he called it, a general characteristic of this region's folk music. Jan√°ƒçek partly composed the original piano accompaniments to more than 150 folk songs, respectful of their original function and context, H 4570 and partly used folk inspiration in his own works, especially in his mature compositions. His work in this area was not stylistically imitative; instead, he developed a new and original musical aesthetic based on a deep study of the fundamentals of folk music. Through his systematic notation of folk songs as he heard them, Jan√°ƒçek developed an exceptional sensitivity to the melodies and rhythms of speech, from which he compiled a collection of distinctive segments he called \\"speech tunes\\". He used these \\"essences\\" of spoken language in his vocal and instrumental works. The roots of his style, marked by the lilts of human speech, emerge from the world of folk music.  Russia  Jan√°ƒçek's deep and lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture represents another important element of his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Jan√°ƒçek profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought in connection with the use of Russian folk motifs.≈†tƒõdro≈à (1946), p. 132 Jan√°ƒçek's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit to Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Jan√°ƒçek read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: K√°≈•a Kabanov√°, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's vision of the world into an exciting collective drama.  Other composers  Jan√°ƒçek always deeply admired Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, to whom he dedicated some of his works. He rearranged part of Dvo≈ô√°k's Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment. In the early years of the 20th century, Jan√°ƒçek became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers. His opera Destiny was a response to another significant and famous work in contemporary Bohemia ‚Äì Louise, by the French composer Gustave Charpentier.Tyrrell (1991‚Äì92), p. 108 The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Jan√°ƒçek's later works, for example in his opera K√°≈•a Kabanov√°. Although he carefully observed developments in European music, his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes.Tyrrell (1991‚Äì92), p. 156  Music theorist = Musicology  Jan√°ƒçek created his music theory works, essays and articles over a period of fifty years, from 1877 to 1927. He wrote and edited the Hudebn√≠ listy journal, and contributed to many specialist music journals, such as Cec√≠lie, Hl√≠dka and Dalibor. He also completed several extensive studies, as √öpln√° nauka o harmonii (The Complete Harmony Theory), O skladbƒõ souzvuk≈Øv a jejich spoj≈Øv (On the Construction of Chords and Their Connections) and Z√°klady hudebn√≠ho sƒçasov√°n√≠ (Basics of Musical Sƒçasov√°n√≠).Teoretick√© d√≠lo, p. 677 In his essays and books, Jan√°ƒçek examined various musical topics, forms, melody and harmony theories, dyad and triad chords, counterpoint (or \\"opora\\", meaning \\"support\\") and devoted himself to the study of the mental composition.Teoretick√© d√≠lo, pp. 677‚Äì78. His theoretical works stress the Czech term \\"sƒçasov√°n√≠\\", Jan√°ƒçek's specific word for rhythm, which has relation to time (\\"ƒças\\" in Czech), and the handling of time in music composition.Teoretick√© d√≠lo, p. 676 He distinguished several types of rhythm (sƒçasovka): \\"zn√≠c√≠\\" (sounding) ‚Äì meaning any rhythm, \\"ƒç√≠tac√≠\\" (counting) ‚Äì meaning smaller units measuring the course of rhythm; and \\"scelovac√≠\\" (summing) ‚Äì a long value comprising the length of a rhythmical unit.Teoretick√© d√≠lo, pp. 676‚Äì77. Jan√°ƒçek used the combination of their mutual action widely in his own works.  Other writings  Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's literary legacy represents an important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed not only to music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His work in this area comprises around 380 individual items.Liter√°rn√≠ d√≠lo, p. Iiii His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.  Folk music research  Jan√°ƒçek collecting folksongs on 19 August 1906 in Str√°n√≠ Jan√°ƒçek came from a region characterized by its deeply rooted folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel K≈ô√≠≈ækovsk√Ω.Jan√°ƒçkovy z√°znamy hudebn√≠ho a taneƒçn√≠ho folkloru, p. 381 His meeting with the folklorist and dialectologist Franti≈°ek Barto≈° (1837‚Äì1906) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Jan√°ƒçek became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations.Jan√°ƒçkovy z√°znamy hudebn√≠ho a taneƒçn√≠ho folkloru, p. 382 He was one of the organizers of the Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia, a branch of the Austrian institute Das Volkslied in √ñsterreich (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Jan√°ƒçek was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia.Jan√°ƒçkovy z√°znamy hudebn√≠ho a taneƒçn√≠ho folkloru, p. 383 In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and became one of the first to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.  Criticism  Jan√°ƒçek with Karel Kova≈ôovic and Jan Kunc in Summer 1917 Czech musicology at the beginning of the 20th century was strongly influenced by Romanticism, in particular by the styles of Wagner and Smetana. Performance practices were conservative, and actively resistant to stylistic innovation. During his lifetime, Jan√°ƒçek reluctantly conceded to Karel Kova≈ôovic's instrumental rearrangement of Jen≈Øfa, most noticeably in the finale, in which Kova≈ôovic added a more \\"festive\\" sound of trumpets and French horns, and doubled some instruments to support Jan√°ƒçek's \\"poor\\" instrumentation.Ort (2005) p. 60 The score of Jen≈Øfa was later restored by Charles Mackerras, and is now performed according to Jan√°ƒçek's original intentions. Another important Czech musicologist, Zdenƒõk Nejedl√Ω, a great admirer of Smetana and later a communist Minister of Culture, condemned Jan√°ƒçek as an author who could accumulate a lot of material, but was unable to do anything with it. He called Jan√°ƒçek's style \\"unanimated\\", and his operatic duets \\"only speech melodies\\", without polyphonic strength.Ort (2005), p. 63 Nejedl√Ω considered Jan√°ƒçek rather an amateurish composer, whose music did not conform to the style of Smetana. According to Charles Mackerras, he tried to destroy Jan√°ƒçek professionally.Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), p. 9 In 2006 Josef Barto≈°, the Czech aesthetician and music critic, described Jan√°ƒçek as a \\"musical eccentric\\" who clung tenaciously to an imperfect, improvising style, but Barto≈° appreciated some elements of Jan√°ƒçek's works and judged him more positively than Nejedl√Ω.Fenom√©n Jan√°ƒçek vƒçera a dnes (2006), pp. 219‚Äì20 Jan√°ƒçek's friend and collaborator V√°clav Talich, former chief-conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, sometimes adjusted Jan√°ƒçek's scores, mainly for their instrumentation and dynamics; some critics sharply attacked him for doing so. Talich re- orchestrated Taras Bulba and the Suite from Cunning Little Vixen justifying the latter with the claim that \\"it was not possible to perform it in the Prague National Theatre unless it was entirely re-orchestrated\\". Talich's rearrangement rather emasculated the specific sounds and contrasts of Jan√°ƒçek's original, but was the standard version for many years.Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), p. 11 Charles Mackerras started to research Jan√°ƒçek's music in the 1960s, and gradually restored the composer's distinctive scoring. The critical edition of Jan√°ƒçek's scores is published by the Czech Editio Jan√°ƒçek.  Legacy  Jan√°ƒçek belongs to a wave of twentieth-century composers who sought greater realism and greater connection with everyday life, combined with a more all-encompassing use of musical resources. His operas in particular demonstrate the use of \\"speech\\"-derived melodic lines, folk and traditional material, and complex modal musical argument. Jan√°ƒçek's works are still regularly performed around the world, and are generally considered popular with audiences. He would also inspire later composers in his homeland, as well as music theorists, among them Jaroslav Volek, to place modal development alongside harmony of importance in music. Jan√°ƒçek relief, by Julius Pelik√°n, at Olomouc The operas of his mature period, Jen≈Øfa (1904), K√°≈•a Kabanov√° (1921), The Cunning Little Vixen (1924), The Makropulos Affair (1926) and From the House of the Dead (after a novel by Dostoyevsky and premi√®red posthumously in 1930) are considered his finest works.Kundera (2004), p. 43 The Australian conductor Sir Charles Mackerras became very closely associated with Jan√°ƒçek's operas. Jan√°ƒçek's chamber music, while not especially voluminous, includes works which are widely considered twentieth- century classics, particularly his two string quartets: Quartet No. 1, \\"The Kreutzer Sonata\\" inspired by the Tolstoy novel, and the Quartet No. 2, \\"Intimate Letters\\". Milan Kundera called these compositions the peak of Jan√°ƒçek's output.Kundera (1996), p. 180 The world premi√®re of Jan√°ƒçek's lyrical Concertino for piano, two violins, viola, clarinet, French horn and bassoon took place in Brno on 16 February 1926. It was also performed at the Frankfurt Festival of Modern Music in 1927 by Ilona ≈†tƒõp√°nov√°-Kurzov√°. A comparable chamber work for an even more unusual set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba, was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost the use of his right hand during World War I. After its premi√®re in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world. Other well known pieces by Jan√°ƒçek include the Sinfonietta, the Glagolitic Mass (the text written in Old Church Slavonic), and the rhapsody Taras Bulba. These pieces and the above-mentioned five late operas were all written in the last decade of Jan√°ƒçek's life. Jan√°ƒçek established a school of composition in Brno. Among his notable pupils were Jan Kunc, V√°clav Kapr√°l, Vil√©m Petr≈æelka, Jaroslav Kvapil, Osvald Chlubna, B≈ôetislav Bakala, and Pavel Haas. Most of his students neither imitated nor developed Jan√°ƒçek's style, which left him no direct stylistic descendants. According to Milan Kundera, Jan√°ƒçek developed a personal, modern style in relative isolation from contemporary modernist movements but was in close contact with developments in modern European music. His path towards the innovative \\"modernism\\" of his later years was long and solitary, and he achieved true individuation as a composer around his 50th year.Kundera (2004), p. 70 Star on Musik Meile Vienna Sir Charles Mackerras, the Australian conductor who helped promote Jan√°ƒçek's works on the world's opera stages, described his style as \\"... completely new and original, different from anything else ... and impossible to pin down to any one style\\".Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), pp. 7‚Äì8 According to Mackerras, Jan√°ƒçek's use of whole-tone scale differs from that of Debussy, his folk music inspiration is absolutely dissimilar from Dvo≈ô√°k's and Smetana's, and his characteristically complex rhythms differ from the techniques of the young Stravinsky.Tyrrell; Mackerras (2003), p. 8 The French conductor and composer Pierre Boulez, who interpreted Jan√°ƒçek's operas and orchestral works, called his music surprisingly modern and fresh: \\"Its repetitive pulse varies through changes in rhythm, tone and direction.\\" He described his opera From the House of the Dead as \\"primitive, in the best sense, but also extremely strong, like the paintings of L√©ger, where the rudimentary character allows a very vigorous kind of expression\\". The Czech conductor, composer and writer Jaroslav Vogel wrote what was for a long time considered the standard biography of Jan√°ƒçek in 1958. It first appeared in German translation,Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, Leben und Werk, Artia, Prague, 1958 and in the Czech original in 1963. The first English translation came out in 1962, it was then re-issued in a version revised by Karel Janovick√Ω in 1981. Charles Mackerras regarded it as his \\"Jan√°ƒçek bible\\".Cole, Hugo. 'Journeys to Self Discovery' in Country Life, 24 December 1981, p 2246 Jan√°ƒçek's life has been featured in several films. In 1974 Eva Marie Ka≈àkov√° made a short documentary Fotograf a muzika (The Photographer and the Music) about the Czech photographer Josef Sudek and his relationship to Jan√°ƒçek's work. In 1983 the Brothers Quay produced a stop motion animated film, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek: Intimate Excursions, about Jan√°ƒçek's life and work, and in 1986 the Czech director Jaromil Jire≈° made Lev s b√≠lou h≈ô√≠vou (Lion with the White Mane), which showed the amorous inspiration behind Jan√°ƒçek's works. In Search of Jan√°ƒçek is a Czech documentary directed in 2004 by Petr Ka≈àka, made to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Jan√°ƒçek's birth. An animated cartoon version of The Cunning Little Vixen was made in 2003 by the BBC, with music performed by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and conducted by Kent Nagano. A rearrangement of the opening of the Sinfonietta was used by the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer for the song \\"Knife-Edge\\" on their 1970 debut album. The Jan√°ƒçek Philharmonic Orchestra was established in 1954. Today the 116-piece ensemble is associated with mostly contemporary music but also regularly performs works from the classical repertoire. The orchestra is resident at the House of Culture V√≠tkovice (D≈Øm kultury V√≠tkovice) in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The orchestra tours extensively and has performed in Europe, the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Its current music director is Theodore Kuchar. Asteroid 2073 Jan√°ƒçek, discovered in 1974 by Lubo≈° Kohoutek, is named in his honor. The Haruki Murakami novel 1Q84 uses Jan√°ƒçek's Sinfonietta as a recurring plot point. Ostrava's international airport was renamed after Jan√°ƒçek in November 2006.

Mifflintown PA 1.jpgHouse near the courthouse Juniata County Courthouse.jpgJuniata County Courthouse Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.jpgBuilding on Bridge Street  Business  As the county seat of Juniata County, Mifflintown serves as the county's center of business and government. Given the borough's small size, as well as the county's small population, the presence of business and government remain limited. The Mifflintown borough boundaries limit the size of the community, meaning that retail and business functions necessarily spill over onto land of bordering municipalities. Nevertheless, Mifflintown serves as the corporate headquarters of both The Juniata Valley Bank and Pennian Bank. Empire Kosher Poultry, the nation's largest producer of kosher poultry, has both its headquarters and processing facility in adjoining Fermanagh Township. Land surrounding Mifflintown serves as Juniata County's retail center as well, hosting Weis Markets, Family Dollar, Dollar General, and numerous smaller shops like Two Sisters and Mac's Clothing, gas stations, restaurants, including Sheetz, Rutter‚Äôs Farm Stores, and Mifflintown Mart.  Transportation  Illustrated map of Mifflintown in 1895 Pennsylvania Route 35, a southwest-northeast highway that serves as Juniata County's principal arterial highway running in that direction, forms the main street of Mifflintown. It intersects the former mainline of US routes 22 and 322, which was moved in the early 1970s to a four-lane bypass lying east of the town. The former Pennsylvania Railroad mainline tracks, now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway, lie across the Juniata River in the adjoining town of Mifflin.  Education  Mifflintown is the home of Juniata High School, which serves the southern half of Juniata County. Tuscarora Junior High School and Juniata Elementary School are also located in the town.

At the time, the Port Royal post office was located in Saint Tammany town, just across the Tuscarora Creek. However, the Pennsylvania Railroad brought increased traffic through the area and prompted a move of the Port Royal post office into Perrysville in 1847. In 1874, the borough took on the name itself and Saint Tammany became known as Old Port. Throughout the history of Port Royal, the general population was almost centered around agriculture. The rural counties within Port Royal include Turbett, Spruce Hill and Milford Townships, otherwise known as the Tuscarora Valley. Port Royal (and Perrysville before it) once was a stop on the old main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Port Royal was, in fact, one of the first towns to be linked to the Pennsylvania Railroad system, as it lay along the Lewistown-to-Harrisburg stretch of the railroad‚Äîthe first leg constructed after the new railroad was chartered. Located along the Juniata River, many forms of transportation passed through the small town as a result of the river being an essential transportation \\"highway\\" before automobiles.http://portroyal200.com/history.php However, the Pennsylvania Railroad station no longer exists. Port Royal was also the northern terminus of the Tuscarora Valley Railroad, a narrow-gauge railroad serving southern Juniata and northern Franklin counties. The railroad was decommissioned in the 1930s. From the PRR station during the Gettysburg Campaign of the Civil War, Union scout Stephen W. Pomeroy telegraphed the vital news to Governor Andrew Curtin that Robert E. Lee was concentrating the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg. This was how state officials came to know of this vital intelligence, which Pomeroy had carried for nearly sixty miles from near Lee's headquarters in Chambersburg.

Juniata County Fair The first fair was held in Port Royal in 1852 and there has been an annual fair in the town thereafter. In 1887 the original fairgrounds south of town were found to lack adequate space and a larger tract of land was purchased north of the town, from Smith Kepner, in what is now known as the Juniata County Fair Grounds. Beginning as primarily a showcase for agrarian enterprise, the fair has slowly changed so that today it has much less of its agrarian roots. In 1953 weekly summer automobile racing began on a track that was originally built for horse racing and this activity has played a large part in focusing attention on the town during the summer months.

With over twenty bookshops, it is often described as \\"the town of books\\", and is both the National Book Town of Wales and the site of the annual Hay Festival. The settlement's name is first referred to between 1135 and 1147 as ; in 1299 the name of is used. By the 16th century it was simply called Hay, and the use of the river as a suffix is a later addition. In 1215, a Welsh name, was recorded, and in 1614; the two names may have been used concurrently in 1625. The English language name, Hay, is derived from Old English , possibly meaning a \\"fenced area\\" and a noun used in late Saxon and Norman times for an enclosure in a forest. The Welsh word (lenited to ) has a range of meanings including wooded areas of various extents.

Richard Booth opened his first shop there in 1962, and by the 1970s Hay had gained the nickname \\"The Town of Books\\". Hay Festival Since 1988, Hay-on-Wye has been the venue for an annual literary festival, now sponsored by The Daily Telegraph newspaper, which draws a claimed 80,000 visitors over ten days at the end of May or beginning of June to see and hear big literary names from all over the world. Devised by Norman, Rhoda and Peter Florence in 1988, the festival was described by Bill Clinton in 2001 as \\"The Woodstock of the mind\\". Tony Benn said: \\"In my mind it's replaced Christmas\\". Peter Florence continues to be director of the Festival. In 2019, the Festival was reported to have directly generated ¬£83 million for Hay-On-Wye's economy over the previous ten years. In earlier years, the festival was held at a variety of venues around Hay, including the local Primary School. In 2005 it moved to a unified location at the west of the town, with classical music concerts held in St Mary's Church. Location The town lies on the south- east bank of the River Wye and is within the north-easternmost tip of the Brecon Beacons National Park, just north of the Black Mountains. The town is just on the Welsh side of the border with Herefordshire, England, here defined by the Dulas Brook. Where the brook joins the River Wye just north of the town, the border continues northwards along the river. The Wye was the boundary between the former counties and districts of Radnorshire and Brecknockshire. The adjacent village of Cusop lies on the English side of the Dulas Brook. The nearest city is Hereford, county town of Herefordshire, some to the east. The Royal Mail depot in Hay is a sub-office of Hereford, and therefore although in Wales has an English postal address, being part of the HR3 postcode. alt= Governance Hay-on-Wye is a Welsh community with a Town Council. Its boundary follows the English border/Dulas Brook from the River Wye southeastwards for just over a kilometre, turns south-west to a point just south of Oakfield house, thence north to Greenpit Farm and north westwards, enclosing the Hay Showground and meeting the National Park boundary near the B4350, Brecon Road. From this point, it follows the National Park boundary to the River Wye and the river back to the Dulas Brook. The Town Council consists of a Mayor, Deputy Mayor and eight councillors. Hay also participates in the election of a councillor to Powys County Council as part of a larger county division. Transportation The B4350 runs through the town and the B4351 links it with the main A438 from Brecon to Hereford, on the far side of the River Wye. The town was formerly served at Hay-on-Wye railway station by the train services which closed in 1963 under the Beeching Axe. There is a semi- regular bus that links Hay to Brecon (and then Cardiff) and to Hereford. Other activities Hay Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1903. The club continued on its nine-hole course until the onset of World War 2.\\"Hay Golf Club\\", \\"Golf‚Äôs Missing Links\\".

Music headliners have included Clean Bandit, Hot Chip, and Donovan. Comedians have included James Acaster, Sarah Pascoe, and Phil Wang. History Hay-on- Wye, like Builth Wells, has two Norman castles within a short distance of each other. It seems likely that Hay was first fortified by William Fitz Osbern during his penetration of south-east Wales in the summer of 1070, when he defeated three Welsh kings. The history of the site then continues through the lordships of the de Neufmarch√©s, which was confirmed at the Battle of Brecon in 1093, and also the Gloucester/Hereford families until 1165, when the district of Brycheiniog passed into the hands of the de Braose dynasty of Marcher Lords. In 1230 Hay Castle passed to the de Bohuns and the local history, including the battle near Hay in 1231, is continued through the Mortimer Wars of the 1260s and the battle near Brecon in 1266 down to the death of Earl Humphrey de Bohun in 1298. First castle Lying close to St Mary's Church on the western edge of Hay-on-Wye is a small but well-preserved motte. The site overlooks a gorge and small stream, locally known as The Loggin Brook, that flows into the River Wye, which was undoubtedly one reason for the construction of a motte and bailey castle there. A recently levelled platform under the car park to the north east may have once have housed the castle's bailey. This little fortress was probably the work of William Revel, a knight of Bernard de Neufmarch√© who is usually referred to as Bernard Newmarch, and may later have been the seat for the manor or commote of Melinog. Other than this, the motte has no further recorded history. Stone castle The main fortress within Hay-on-Wye was situated on the great site commanding the town and river under the current ruins of the castle and mansion. This was undoubtedly the 'castello de haia' handed to Miles of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, in 1121 with Sibyl de Neufmarch√©, the daughter of Bernard de Neufmarch√©. It is most likely that the keep stood by this time. It is therefore possible that this is the oldest Norman tower in Wales, dating to the onslaught of William Fitz Osbern in 1070. During the anarchy (1136‚Äì54) in the reign of King Stephen a series of charters were passed by the Gloucesters concerning the castle. In 1165 the last of Miles of Gloucester's male descendants was killed at nearby Bronllys Castle and Hay-on- Wye Castle passed into the hands of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber and of New Radnor and Buellt. The de Braose dynasty were energetic lords and probably built the core of the gatehouse which now stands besides the keep. In the summer of 1198 a major English army formed here before marching off to victory at the Battle of Painscastle some four miles to the north. In 1230 the last de Braose of Brecon, William de Braose was hanged by Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Brecon lordship with Hay-on-Wye passed into the hands of the de Bohuns. Taking advantage of this in 1231, Prince Llywelyn ravaged the lands of his de Bohun in-laws during which Hay-on-Wye town was burnt, although the castle survived the onslaught. The castle saw service in the Barons' War of 1263 to 1266, changing hands three times, once being surrendered to the great Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. With the conquest of Wales by King Edward I Longshanks life became more peaceful in this Marcher town. Around 1401 both town and castle suffered damage by the forces of Owain Glynd≈µr, although the castle was listed as defensible against the Welsh in 1403. The fortress later passed to the earls of Stafford, who were to become the unlucky dukes of Buckingham during the Wars of the Roses. The castle was repaired during the conflicts of the 1460s, although its military use would have been somewhat dubious against cannon. In the 1660s, James Boyle of Hereford built a new mansion on the north side of the castle, and most of the curtain wall was demolished to improve the views. The mansion is now used for second-hand bookselling. Remains of castle Hay Castle and Mansion The keep is roughly square, and once had four storeys. The corners of the tower have been much rebuilt, probably due to insecure foundations. The entire south east corner of the tower has been replaced and it is possible that when first constructed there was a spiral stair here to allow access to the upper floors. This tower is similar to the keep found at Goodrich Castle. Some time in the 12th century the strong curtain wall with gate was added to the site. This gateway is one of the finest carved castle gateways in Wales and is comparable with the much more ornate work at Newcastle near Bridgend. The two gates hanging within the gateway, although of different ages, would appear to be very old ‚Äî the gates at Chepstow Castle have been dendrochronologically dated to the reign of King Henry II (1154‚Äì89). Probably during the troubles of the Barons' War a small tower was added in front of the gateway to make a proper gatehouse complete with portcullis. The portcullis mechanism mounted on the wall walk was reached via a flight of steps up over the back of the gate passageway, which also allowed access to the wall walks. Hay-on-Wye has a Victorian clock tower (below right); there is an identical twin clock tower in Knighton, Powys. The Clock Tower, Hay Notable buildings Hay has nearly 150 listed buildings, including the Castle, St Mary's parish church, St John's chapel, the Ebenezer United Reformed Church, the Swan Hotel, and part of the Town Hall, as well as many of the town centre inns and shops. The Butter Market was built in the form of a Doric temple in 1833 by William Enoch: the Cheese Market was built in 1835 for Sir Joseph Bailey; both are on the site of the 17th century market house. Cockcroft House on Union Mews is the former workhouse. It was built in 1837 for the Hay Poor Law Union which was formed on 26th September 1836. The Harley Almshouses, 1 Brecon Road, were built and endowed by Frances Harley in 1836 in memory of her sister Martha Harley of Trebarried. The former vicarage for St Mary's church is on the corner of Church Street and Oxford Road. Rock House on Broad Street was built as the manse to the 1845 Ebenezer Chapel. Oakfield is a Grade II listed Regency house located south of the town centre: built in about 1820, it was recorded in 1842 as the home of Henry Allen Junior.

King of Hay-on-Wye Richard Booth in 1984 On 1 April 1977, bibliophile Richard Booth conceived a publicity stunt in which he declared Hay-on-Wye to be an 'independent kingdom' with himself as its monarch and a National Anthem written by Les Penning. The tongue-in-cheek micronation of Hay-on-Wye has subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests for which some credit Booth.

It is bordered by Dalton and Glenburn township to the west, North Abington Township to the north, the boroughs of Clarks Summit and Clarks Green to the south, and South Abington Township to the south and southeast. Waverly Township is part of the growing suburban area known as the \\"Abingtons\\". The population was 1,743 at the 2010 census. Prior to 2011, the township was named Abington Township, and was originally referred to as \\"Ebbington\\" in Connecticut's claim in 1806. History Waverly was founded in the late 18th century by settlers from Connecticut, along the Warriors' Path, and was originally called \\"Abington Center\\". In 1853, it was established as a borough within Pennsylvania and renamed \\"Waverly\\" after Sir Walter Scott's novel of the same name, popular at that time. It was renamed because there was another municipality named Abington located near Philadelphia. The borough, located within Lackawanna County, gave up its charter in 1920 due to the high cost of upgrading its main street to a state highway, and became Abington Township. The Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike (now Main Street) was chartered in 1919 by the Pennsylvania Legislature along the Warriors' Path. Started in 1820, the turnpike was completed in 1824. In 1828 the Wayside Inn was built, and the first doctor, Andrew Bedford, set up practice and built a house which stands today on Main Street. The first general store was built in 1830, followed by a second inn and tavern in 1832. A building boom ensued during the years 1847 through 1890, during which time Waverly was a profitable small- scale industrial center. During the mid-19th century, Waverly was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Escaped slaves and freedmen found a sympathetic population in Waverly, and some settled in small houses built by a local farmer and sold to them. The freedmen also built the AME Church, which is in use today as a private residence. It is one of five churches in existence in 1872, three of which still stand and are still active congregations. Due to confusion between the Montgomery County township and Lacakwanna County's North, South, and West Abington townships, township officials set up a ballot initiative to rename the municipality to Waverly based on one of its former names. On November 2, 2010, voters in the township overwhelmingly voted to change the township's name to Waverly Township, with 706 voting for the change and 115 against. The name change officially took place on January 1, 2011. The Waverly Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  Fire in 1916  In the spring of 1916, a fire devastated the four downtown blocks of Waverly; only 11 businesses remained thereafter. Of those, two buildings have operating businesses in them today: The Waverly Deli and The Waverly General Store. The front two blocks were an eyesore, although summer visitors continued to come from Scranton to Waverly. The Belin Family bought the front two blocks and began design and construction of the Waverly Community House. The building was completed in 1920, and expanded to the back two blocks of the original downtown; all streets through those blocks had been removed, and the transformation of downtown to picturesque center was complete. Waverly Community House The Community House (commonly referred to as \\"The Comm\\") sits at the center of Waverly. The brick Dutch colonial structure currently houses the Waverly Post Office, a gymnasium with basketball court, a public playground, a preschool program and numerous recreational and educational offerings for families with young children. The Comm also plays host to an annual home and garden show, antique fair, and concerts on the lawn. Margaretta E. Belin funded construction of The Comm as a memorial to her husband, Henry Belin Jr., after his death in 1917. On June 4, 1920, the building and a portion of the land were deeded to Abington Township for the benefit of the township's residents. Wealthy summer visitors from Scranton migrated to Waverly on a permanent basis, and the town's reputation as a white-collar bedroom community was cemented. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, are water. The central part of the township comprises the Waverly census-designated place. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 1,743 people, 639 households, and 515 families residing in the township. The population density was 378.9 people per square mile (146.3/km).

Education The first school was started in his log cabin in 1804 by Elder Miller, the first settler in the town. The first dedicated school was built in 1830 on the Philadelphia and Great Bend Turnpike. After it ceased being used as a school, it became a private residence for many years; the Waverly Historic Society is currently planning for its renovation and use as their headquarters. In 1844, a group of investors started the Madison Academy. This was a private school which enjoyed high regard and taught a rigorous curriculum to boys and girls. Students came from all over Pennsylvania to attend the Madison Academy; some of its graduates became judges and attorneys. The tuition ranged from $2.00 to $10.00 per quarter, depending upon the grade, and the boarding house next door charged $1.25 to $1.50 per week. Following the closing of the private school in 1878, the building was used as a public school through 1925, at which time it was razed. The Belin family donated a new school building to the town that originally served all grades. The site of that school is now occupied a newer building, Waverly Elementary School, which serves Kindergarten through fourth grade and is part of the Abington Heights School District. This is currently the only public school in the township, and is where all of the elementary students in the township attend school. The bell from the Madison Academy hangs behind Waverly Elementary, a testament to the long tradition of academic excellence in Waverly. Although the academy was razed, the house across the street from it has a bell in its attic, and is sometimes mistaken for the original Madison Academy. All middle school students residing in Waverly Township attend Abington Heights Middle School, and high school students attend Abington Heights High School.

The population was 5,116 at the 2010 census. It is also the northern terminus of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension, I-476. History The first settler in the area currently known as Clarks Summit was William Clark. Clark had fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill during the Revolutionary War, and as payment for his military service, he was issued of Pennsylvania land by Congress. Because of disputes between Pennsylvania and Connecticut over the area of land that is now northern Pennsylvania (resulting in the Pennamite-Yankee War), the land deed issued to Clark was deemed invalid by the Luzerne County land grant office. Clark had no choice but to pay for the land himself. In March 1799, Clark and his three sons moved into a log cabin in the Abington wilderness, located on what is currently the Clarks Green Cemetery. The first school was built in 1893 and was destroyed by fire two years later.Clarks Summit Borough History and Background The village of Clarks Summit and an adjacent tract of land were incorporated into the Borough of Clarks Summit on August 30, 1911.

Coal mining was an important industry in the past. The borough's population peaked at 12,395 in 1930 and was 6,070 at the 2010 census.  History  Dickson City was once known as \\"Priceburg\\". It was the newest village in the valley and one of the most progressive. German immigrants then founded the village of Priceville in 1863, in honor of Eli Price. This section of the town developed rapidly after 1880, when John Jermyn sank the shaft which is now known as the Johnson shaft. Here the population had grown from 329 to 841. In June 1875, Dickson City was incorporated as a borough, including at the time all of the present borough of Throop. Dickson City received its name from Thomas Dickson, founder of the Dickson Manufacturing Company.http://dicksoncityborough.org/documents/history.pdf Once dominated by coal mines, this borough has in recent times become the center of a thriving retail corridor focused along Business Route 6 and around the Viewmont Mall. Many of the nation's big-box stores and chain restaurants are represented here. Most of the newer retail complexes are located along Viewmont Drive and Commerce Boulevard, both built by developers to access the borough's vast dormant coal lands. Some of the centers that were built in the 1990s and early 2000s include Dickson City Crossings, Dickson City Commons, Park Center and Commerce Plaza. A Target center, Adventure Games (the largest gaming shop in northeastern Pennsylvania), a Great Escape IMAX Movie Theatre, and the only Books a Million book store in the area are located at these shopping centers. The borough also boasts northeastern Pennsylvania's first Starbucks location. The borough unexpectedly entered the pop culture scene when, in a 2006 episode of NBC's sitcom, The Office, entitled \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\", Michael (Steve Carell) asks Ryan (B.J. Novak) to get a particular video from his mom's house \\"in Dickson City\\". The show uses Scranton as its setting. After Route 6 (also named the Scranton/Carbondale Highway), Main Street serves as the borough's other major thoroughfare. It features a slightly older stock of stores, bars, professional offices and homes. One point of major contention in the borough has been a swath of reclaimed coal-mining land south of Commerce Boulevard that was deeded to the borough for public use after the state government cleaned it up. Plans to build a bond-financed municipal golf course on the land launched during the early 2000s were scuttled after some borough council members campaigned against that form of borrowing and won the majority of seats. The land was seized by a local bank after interim loans went unpaid, but because the state stipulated that it has to remain in the hands of a municipality, neighboring borough Dunmore snapped it up. Geography Dickson City is located at (41.465984, -75.625401). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of its land. Interstate 81 has two commercially-important exits in Dickson City‚Äîone with Main Avenue and one with the old 6 (the Scranton-Carbondale Highway.) The Viewmont Mall is in both Dickson City and Scranton. The geographic location of the center of business dictates the revenue, according to Pennsylvania tax law.

Dickson City Junior High School was on a block on the block between Jackson Street and Jermyn Street and faced Albert Street; Dickson City Senior High School was next door and faced Carmalt Street. As the population declined, the neighborhood schools were closed, and the junior high school became a kindergarten through 8th grade school. In 1969, the Olyphant, Dickson City, and Throop school districts consolidated to form the Mid Valley School District. Dickson City Junior High School became Mid-Valley Junior High School; Dickson City Senior High School became Dickson City Elementary School. Currently, the Mid-Valley School District has a single elementary school, and a single secondary school on Underwood Road in Throop.

Dunmore was settled in 1835 and incorporated in 1862. Extensive anthracite coal, brick, stone, and silk interests had led to a rapid increase in the population from 8,315 in 1890 to 23,086 in 1940. The population was 14,057 in the 2010 census.  History  Dunmore was settled in 1835 and incorporated in 1862. The first white person to set foot on Dunmore soil was Count Zinzendorf of Saxony, in 1742, as a missionary to the native people who were Munsee- speaking Delawares. The territory now encompassing Dunmore was purchased from the natives in 1754 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut and became the township of Providence. The first settlers of the Dunmore area arrived in 1771 and were originally from Connecticut (see Pennamite‚ÄìYankee War). William Allsworth established an inn here in 1783. In the summer of 1795, Charles Dolph, John Carey, and John West began the labor of clearing and plowing lands in the neighborhood of \\"Bucktown\\" or \\"Corners\\", as this area was called. Edward Lunnon, Isaac Dolph, James Brown, Philip Swartz and Levi De Puy, purchased land here between 1799‚Äì1805. Stephen Tripp, in 1820, began the area's first business, erecting a saw and grist mill on the Roaring Brook half a mile south of the village. That same year, the Drinker Turnpike Company opened a store at the Corners. Shortly after Joseph Tanner opened the first blacksmith shop. C.W. Potter opened the first merchandising house in the village in 1845. The village, consisting of but four houses, had a negative existence until the Pennsylvania Coal Company, in 1847-1848, turned it into a growing and diverse town. By 1875, the township of Providence was dissolved and the land split up into various smaller boroughs and towns with Dunmore being one of them. Today, Dunmore is a borough bordering the city of Scranton. The name Dunmore comes from Dunmore Park, in the Falkirk area of Scotland (home of the Dunmore Pineapple). Golo Footwear had its original manufacturing and design facilities in Dunmore until 1957. Geography Dunmore is located at (41.417530, ‚àí75.624432). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.11%) is water. Roaring Brook flows from the southeast and turns west through the Nay Aug Gorge in Dunmore to the Lackawanna River in Scranton. Most of the borough is drained by Roaring Brook, except for an area in the west drained by Meadow Brook into the Lackawanna River. The southeast side of the borough is on the slopes of the Moosic Mountains, which the gorge cuts through. The Lackawanna Railroad operated through the Nay Aug Gorge into Scranton from the Poconos and Northern New Jersey.

In the borough, the population was spread out, with 19.3% under the age of 18, 63.7% from 18 to 64, and 17% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.6 years. The median income for a household in the borough was $32,721, and the median income for a family was $45,091. Males had a median income of $30,647 versus $24,825 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $17,049. About 7.4% of families and 11.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.2% of those under age 18 and 24.2% of those age 65 or over. Education While the anthracite coal industry was thriving, there were numerous neighborhood schools: the Columbus School in the Smoketown section, the Washington School and the Roosevelt School in the Fern Hill section, the Lincoln School in the Grassy Island Heights section, as well as a three-room school in the Underwood Village and a one-room school in Marshwood. There was a Central School for elementary school students who lived downtown and in the Flats section. The annex of the Central School was Olyphant Senior High School. Olyphant Junior High School was in a separate building. As the population declined, the neighborhood schools were closed and demolished. In 1969, the Olyphant, Dickson City, and Throop school districts consolidated to form the Mid Valley School District. The Olyphant Junior High School became the Mid-Valley Senior High School. The annex of the Olyphant Elementary School had elementary school grades as well as some overflow classes from the senior high school. On February 10, 1977, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry condemned the Olyphant Elementary School and the annex. The displaced elementary school students were moved to the Mid- Valley Junior High School in Dickson City. The displaced junior high school students and the senior high school students attended classes in the senior high school on split sessions. Eventually, new schools were built. Currently, the Mid-Valley School District has a single elementary school, and a single secondary school on Underwood Road in Throop. Up until the mid-1970s, each Catholic parish had a parochial school: St. Patrick‚Äôs, St. Michael‚Äôs, and Holy Ghost. Saints Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic School remained open longer, but it was eventually closed. There are private Catholic schools in neighboring municipalities. The La Salle Academy Primary Campus in Dickson City is for students in Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 3; the Main Campus in Jessup is for students in Grades 4 through 8. High school students can attend Bishop O'Hara High School in Dunmore and Scranton Preparatory School in Scranton.

Biography =Early life and ordination Birth and baptismal certificate of Lionel Groulx, 13 January 1878, √©glise Saint-Michel in Vaudreuil (Qu√©bec). Lionel Groulx, n√© Joseph Adolphe Lyonel Groulx, the son of a farmer and lumberjack, and direct descendant of New France pioneer Jean Grou, was born and died at Vaudreuil, Quebec. After his seminary training and studies in Europe, he taught at Valleyfield College in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, and then the Universit√© de Montr√©al. In 1917 he co-founded a monthly journal called Action Fran√ßaise, becoming its editor in 1920. Study of Confederation Groulx was one of the first Quebec historians to study Confederation: he insisted on its recognition of Quebec rights and minority rights, although he believed a combination of corrupt political parties and French Canadian minority status in the Dominion had failed to deliver on those promises, as the Manitoba conflict exposed. Groulx believed that only through national education and the Quebec government could the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians be repaired. Groulx was quite successful promoting his brand of ultramontanism. His main focus was to restore Quebeckers' pride in their identity by knowledge of history, both the heroic acts of New France and the French Canadian and self-government rights obtained through a succession of important political victories: 1774, the Quebec Act recognized the rights of the Quebec province and its people with respect to French law, Catholic religion and the French language; in 1848, responsible government was finally obtained after decades of struggle, along with the rights of the French language; in 1867, the autonomy of the province of Quebec was restored as Lower Canada was an essential partner in the creation of a new Dominion through Confederation [La Conf√©d√©ration canadienne, Montr√©al, Quebec 10/10, 1978 (1918)]. Lionel Groulx called the Canadian Confederation of 1867 a failure and espoused the theory that French Canada's only hope for survival was to bolster a French State and a Roman Catholic Quebec as the means to emancipate the nation and a bulwark against English power. He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used, within Confederation, to better the lot of the French Canadian nation, economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. His curriculum and writings de- emphasized or ignored conflicts between the clergy and those who were struggling for democratic rights, and de-emphasized any conflicts between the \\"habitants\\" or peasant class and the French-Canadian elites. He preferred the settled habitants to the more adventurous and, in his view, licentious coureurs des bois. His work, under the pseudonym Lionel Montal, was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1928, the Universit√© de Montr√©al insisted that Groulx sign a paper saying that he would respect Confederation and English-Canadian sensibilities as a condition of receiving a respectable salary for his teaching work. He would not sign, but finally agreed to a condition that he would limit himself to historical studies; he resigned from the editorship of L'action canadienne- fran√ßaise soon after, and the magazine ceased publication at the end of the year.Mason Wade, The French-Canadians 1760‚Äì1967, vol. 2, p. 894. Lionel Groulx's major writings include L'Appel de la race (1922), Histoire de la Conf√©d√©ration, Notre grande aventure, Histoire du Canada fran√ßais (1951), and Notre ma√Ætre le pass√©. Writings on New France In order to inculcate such pride in a nation he considered degraded by Conquest, he engaged in national myth-making, celebrating the days of New France as a golden age and elevating Dollard des Ormeaux into a legendary hero. He has been described as the first French Canadian historian to consider the period of the French regime superior to that of the English rule that followed it, evaluating the Conquest as a disaster rather than the common nineteenth century view of it as a blessing that saved Quebec from the atheist terror of the French Revolution.Olivar Asselin, ..L'Oeuvre de l'abb√© Groulx.., 1929. He also developed a Quebec history curriculum that emphasized the heroism of New France, the challenge British Conquest posed to the survival of the \\"Canadiens\\", and how this challenge was met by lengthy political struggles for democratic rights. He particularly insisted, as had many before him, on the Quebec Act of 1774 as the official recognition of his nation's rights. He bore particular affection for the undertaking of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, that in 1849 successfully restored the rights of the French language along with the obtention of responsible government, thus thwarting the assimilation plans of Lord Durham's policy of forced Union between Upper and Lower Canada. (See Lord Elgin) Ligue d'action fran√ßaise At the Ligue d'Action fran√ßaise, Groulx and his colleagues hoped to inspire revival of the French language and French Canadian culture, but also to create a think tank and public space of reflection, so that the French Canadian nation's elites would find ways to remedy French Canada's underdevelopment and exclusion from big business. Some collaborators of the review thus actively participated in the development of the HEC business school. Others were actively involved in the promotion of the Church's Social doctrine, an official Catholic answer to socio-economic distress that was meant to prevent the appeal of socialism and improve capitalism. Groulx's conservative Catholicism was not very appreciative of other religions, although he also acknowledged that racism was not Christian, and he maintained that Quebec should aspire to be a model society by Christian standards, including intense missionary action. [Le Canada fran√ßais missionnaire, Montreal, Fides, 1962]. Catholic social teaching This Catholic social doctrine later became part of the 1930s Action liberale nationale (ALN) party, a new party that intellectuals close to Groulx and the defunct Action fran√ßaise appreciated. When Maurice Duplessis's victory became apparent, some instead accepted to cooperate with his government and its reforms. But Groulx, and with him a large number of intellectuals, chose to oppose him. During the Second World War Groulx, like many Canadien nationalists, spoke in favour of the Vichy regime of Philippe P√©tain, although public statements to this effect remained rare.Lionel Groulx, Constantes de vie (Montr√©al: Fides, 1967), p. 111 and √âric Amyot, Le Qu√©bec entre P√©tain et de Gaulle: Vichy, la France libre et les Canadiens Fran√ßais, p. 173 (Editions Fides, 1999) Groulx and other intellectuals settled into a partial alliance with Liberal Party of Quebec leader Adelard Godbout, who served as Premier from 1939 to 1944. They soon broke with him on account of his submission to the federal Liberals. Yet in 1944 they opposed Duplessis again, this time placing their hopes in another new party, the Bloc populaire Canadien, led by Andr√© Laurendeau. Future Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau was part of this young party, which soon suffered the same fate as the previous third party, the ALN. After the 1948 election, the Bloc populaire Canadien disappeared. Economic protectionism Groulx was later remembered both for his strong case in favour of economic reconquest of Quebec by French Canadians, defense of the French language, and pioneer work as the first chair of Canadian history in Quebec (Universite de Montreal; see Ronald Rudin, Making History in Twentieth Century Quebec, Toronto University Press, 1997). Rudin underscores Groulx's founding role in scholarly History with the development of the Montr√©al History Department. Groulx founded the Institut d'histoire d'Am√©rique fran√ßaise in 1946, an institute located in Montreal devoted to the historical study of Quebec and of the French presence in the Americas and the publication of La revue d'histoire de l'Am√©rique fran√ßaise, still today arguably the main publication for professional historians in Quebec. His main intellectual contribution was to create a rapprochement between nationalism and the Catholic religion, blunting the hostility between them that had existed in the nineteenth century. Later influence Through his writings and teaching at the university and his association with the intellectual elite of Quebec, he had a profound influence on many people (such as Michel Chartrand and Camille Laurin). However, many of the young intellectuals he influenced often did not share his conservative ideology (such as his successor at the University of Montreal). Groulx's traditionalist, religious form of Qu√©b√©cois nationalism, known as clerico-nationalism, influenced Quebec society into the 1950s. Coll√®ge Lionel-Groulx, Lionel Groulx Avenue and the Lionel Groulx metro station are named in his honour. In June 2020, in the wake of global anti- racism and anti-police brutality protests, a petition is being circulated by Montr√©alers asking the city government to rename the Lionel-Groulx m√©tro station after the African-Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson. A counter petition is also circulating, asking Montreal to retain the name. Accusations of anti-Semitism Accusations of anti-Semitism were made by Canadian author Mordecai Richler and French-Canadian historian Esther Delisle in the 1990s against several pre-World War II Quebec intellectuals, including Groulx. In 1933, writing under the pseudonym Jacques Brassier in the article \\"So That We May Live...\\" [Pour qu'on vive...\\"], published in the journal L'Action nationale [National Action], Groulx states his opposition to anti- Semitism. In the section \\"The Jewish Problem\\" [Le probl√®me juif], he states, \\"Antisemitism is not only not a Christian solution [to the Jewish problem], it is a solution that is negative and ridiculous.\\" [\\"L'antis√©mitisme, non seulement n'est pas une solution chr√©tienne; c'est une solution n√©gative et niaise\\"] (trans. Robinson 101). Apologists for Groulx have cited that quotation. However, the following sentence of the article has Groulx go on to give his unequivocal support to the boycott of Jewish businesses in Quebec: \\"To resolve the Jewish problem, it would suffice if French Canadians regained their common sense. There is no need of extraordinary legislation; no need for violence of any sort. We will only give our people the order, 'Do not buy from the Jews'.... And if by some miracle our order were understood and complied with, then in six months the Jewish problem would be solved, not merely in Montr√©al but from one end of the province to the other\\" (trans. Robinson 101-102). Thus, put into context, although he stops short of advocating the legislation of outright anti-Semitic policies and supporting violence against Jews, Groulx supported systemic anti-Semitism by giving French Canadians the \\"order\\" to boycott Jewish businesses to solve the \\"Jewish problem\\" in Quebec. Citing Groulx's assertion that anti-Semitism is \\"negative and ridiculous,\\" some scholars have downplayed allegations of anti-Semitism against Groulx. In a speech given in 1999, the historian Xavier G√©linas argues that Groulx did not support \\"racial anti-Semitism,\\" which \\"confronts Jews for being Jews.\\" While acknowledging the problematic and anti-Semitic nature of Groulx's rhetoric, G√©linas claims that it represents \\"cultural anti-Semitism\\" that singles out Jews because of the \\"principles and customs that they are deemed, rightly or wrongly, to believe in and to practice\\" and are \\"opposed to the traditional nationalist vision of Quebec.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Beaudreau, Sylvie. \\"D√©construire le r√™ve de nation: Lionel Groulx et la R√©volution tranquille.\\" Revue d'histoire de l'Am√©rique fran√ßaise 56#1 (2002): 29-61. * Fr√©gault, Guy.

It is the county seat and largest city of Lackawanna County in Northeastern Pennsylvania's Wyoming Valley and hosts a federal court building for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. With an estimated population in 2019 of 76,653, it is the largest city in northeastern Pennsylvania and the Scranton‚ÄìWilkes-Barre‚ÄìHazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of about 570,000. The city is conventionally divided into nine districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, Providence, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status. Scranton is the geographic and cultural center of the Lackawanna River valley and northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former anthracite coal mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, Pittston, and Carbondale. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a borough in Luzerne County and as a city on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the Scranton General Strike in 1877. People in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839, but the Wilkes-Barre area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when Lackawanna County was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879. The city's nickname \\"Electric City\\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the Dickson Manufacturing Company. Six years later, the United States' first streetcars powered only by electricity began operating in the city.http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E Rev. David Spencer, a local Baptist minister, later proclaimed Scranton as the \\"Electric City\\". The city's industrial production and population peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, fueled by demand for coal and textiles, especially during World War II. But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The Knox Mine disaster of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in the 1930 census to 76,000 in the 2010 census. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors. History=Pre- industrial (1776‚Äì1845) Present-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native Lenape tribe, from whose language \\"Lackawanna\\" (or lac-a-wa-na, meaning \\"stream that forks\\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the American Revolutionary War, as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter. They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the Pennamite Wars, where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.) Arrival of industry (1846‚Äì1899) George Inness's 1855 landscape, The Lackawanna Valley, depicted Scranton and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's roundhouse. Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map Though anthracite coal was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were iron and steel. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and George W. Scranton, who had worked at Oxford Furnace in Belvidere, New Jersey, founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the Lackawanna Steel Company. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The Erie Railroad's construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing T-rails for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads. In 1851, the Scrantons built the Lackawanna and Western Railroad (L&W;) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in Great Bend, Pennsylvania. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years. The Pennsylvania Coal Company built a gravity railroad in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad). The Delaware and Hudson (D&H;) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to Honesdale, built a steam railroad that entered Scranton in 1863. During this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the Greenbacker-Labor Party.) In 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of Lackawanna County, and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized. Creation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the Scranton General Strike of 1877. This was in part due to the larger Great Railroad Strike, in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor John Hartranft eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power. The nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified streetcar (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \\"The Electric City\\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the Scranton Railway Company, which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the Central Railroad of New Jersey and finally the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (NYO&W;). As the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the breakers. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs. Business was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000. In the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early International League baseball teams. Labor history Given its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers. The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the Great Railroad Strike, attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the Scranton General Strike. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. William Walker Scranton, from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded Scranton Steel Company. The labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government. The unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader Terence V. Powderly of the Knights of Labor as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.Vincent J. Falzone, \\"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\\" Pennsylvania History 41.3 (1974): 289-309. While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop James Gibbons of Baltimore, Maryland, it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing. The landmark Coal strike of 1902, was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the United Mine Workers under John Mitchell. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President Theodore Roosevelt. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \\"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\\" Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900‚Äì1945) Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad yards in Scranton, ca.1895 By the United States Census of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and 38th-largest U.S. city. At the turn of the 20th century, wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive Victorian mansions in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages. In 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to Lackawanna, New York, developed on Lake Erie just south of Buffalo. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from National Geographic Magazine Scranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several Catholic and Orthodox churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as John Mitchell, who led the United Mine Workers. The sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the Scranton Surface Protection Association, chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \\"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\\" In 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \\"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations. \\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\\"Cheryl A. Kashuba, \\"Scranton takes on mining, cave-ins\\", The Times-Tribune, 10 October 2010, accessed 23 May 2016 The public transportation system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the Scranton Railways system. The Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to Wilkes- Barre. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of Clarks Summit and Dalton. They could travel to Lake Winola and Montrose using the Northern Electric Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.The Scranton Republican, July 5, 1934, \\"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\\", p. 1 Starting in the early 1920s, the Scranton Button Company (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for Emerson (whom they bought in 1924), as well as Regal, Cameo, Romeo, Banner, Domino, Conqueror. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of Path√© (makers of Path√© and Perfect) to become the American Record Corporation. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for Brunswick, Melotone, and Vocalion. In 1946, the company was acquired by Capitol Records, which continued to produce phonograph records through the end of the vinyl era. By the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000 due to growth in the mining and silk textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from mining in the area since World War I. Image:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpgWashington Ave. in 1907 Image:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpgBurning culm dump c. 1908 Image:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpgOld post office in 1911 Post-World War II (1946‚Äì1984) After World War II, coal lost favor to oil and natural gas as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs. The Knox Mine Disaster of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the Susquehanna River flooded the mines. The DL&W; Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad. Demand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed COLTS, which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey. Scranton had been the hub of its operations until the Erie Lackawanna merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W; Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine subsidence was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive culm dumps, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \\"more economical\\" to abandon the city than make them safe. In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now McDade Park, and another on the Scranton/Dickson City line) were closed. During the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and other textile industries shrank as jobs were moved to the South or overseas. The Globe Store, near Wyoming and Lackawanna Ave., 1978 In 1962, businessman Alex Grass opened his first \\"Thrif D Discount Center\\" drugstore on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton. The store, an immediate success, was the progenitor of the Rite Aid national drugstore chain. During the 1970s and 1980s, many downtown storefronts and theaters became vacant. Suburban development followed the highways and suburban shopping malls became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment. Stabilization and restoration (1985‚Äìpresent) The Historic Electric City sign, restored in 2008, shines again Since the mid-1980s, the city has emphasized revitalization. Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The Steamtown National Historic Site captures the area's once- prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W; train station was restored as the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel. The Electric City Trolley Museum was created next to the DL&W; yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies. Since the mid-1980s the Scranton Cultural Center has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by Raymond Hood, as the region's performing arts center. The Houdini Museum was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician Dorothy Dietrich. In 2003, Hilton Hotels & Resorts opened the Hilton Scranton Hotel & Conference Center at the corner of Adams Avenue & Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton. Due to the rage for paranormal-themed televisions shows, a popular downtown historic Scranton Ghost Walk has been expanded to operate 365 days a year. Other attractions include the Montage Mountain ski resort (formerly Sn√∂ Mountain), the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, AHL affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins; the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (formerly the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees and, before that, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons), AAA affiliate of the New York Yankees; and their PNC Field, and the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain concert venue. According to The Guardian, the city was close to bankruptcy in July 2012, with the wages of all municipal officials, including the mayor and fire chief, being cut to $7.25/hour. Financial consultant Gary Lewis, who lives in Scranton, was quoted as estimating that \\"on 5 July the city had just $5,000 cash in hand.\\" Since the revitalization began, many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars have opened in the downtown, creating a vibrant night-life. The low cost of living, pedestrian-friendly downtown, and the construction of loft- style apartments in older, architecturally significant buildings have attracted young professionals and artists. Many are individuals who grew up in Scranton, moved to big cities after high school and college, and decided to return to the area to take advantage of its amenities. Many buildings around the city that were once empty are currently being restored. Many of the restored buildings will be used to entice new business into the city. Some of the newly renovated buildings are already being used.

Landmarks and attractions The Steamtown National Historic Site showcases steam-era railroading. Excursion trains give visitors tours through Scranton and portions of the Pocono Mountains. Many of Scranton's attractions celebrate its heritage as an industrial center in iron and coal production and its ethnic diversity. The Scranton Iron Furnaces are remnants of the city's founding industry and of the Scranton family's Lackawanna Steel Company. The Steamtown National Historic Site seeks to preserve the history of railroads in the Northeast. The Electric City Trolley Museum preserves and operates pieces of Pennsylvania streetcar history. The Lackawanna Coal Mine tour at McDade Park, conducted inside a former mine, describes the history of mining and railroads in the Scranton area. The former DL&W; Passenger Station is now the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel. Museums in Scranton include the Everhart Museum in Nay Aug Park, which houses a collection of natural history, science and art exhibits; and the Houdini Museum, which features films, exhibits, and a stage show in a unique, century-old building. Terence Powderly's house, still a private dwelling, is one of the city's many historic buildings and, with Steamtown, the city's other National Historic Landmark. In addition, The Lackawanna Historical Society, founded in 1886 and located at the George H. Catlin House in Scranton's Hill Section, focuses on the history of Lackawanna County. Tripp House, built by the Tripp family in 1771, is the oldest building in the city. The city's religious history is evident in the Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Ann, which draws thousands of pilgrims to its annual novena, and St. Stanislaus Cathedral, the seat of the Polish National Catholic Church in North America. The history of the founding of this denomination is tied to Polish immigration to Scranton in the late 19th century. Since the 1970s, Scranton has hosted La Festa Italiana, a three-day Italian festival that takes place on Labor Day weekend on the courthouse square. The festival originally took place around Columbus Day, but was moved because Scranton generally receives cold weather in October. Scranton's large Irish population is represented in the annual Saint Patrick's Day Parade, first held in 1862. Organized by the St. Patrick's Day Parade Association of Lackawanna County, it is the nation's fourth-largest in attendance and second-largest in per capita attendance. Held on the Saturday before Saint Patrick's Day, the parade includes more than 8,000 people, including floats, bagpipe players, high school bands and Irish groups. In 2008, attendance estimates were as high as 150,000 people. For recreation, there is Montage Mountain Ski Resort, known as Sno Mountain for a short period, which rivals the numerous resorts of the Poconos in popularity and offers a relatively comprehensive range of difficulty levels. The Steamtown Marathon has been held each October since 1996 and finishes in downtown Scranton. Nay Aug park is the largest of several parks in Scranton and was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also laid out Central Park in Manhattan, New York City. The city is the home to numerous artistic organizations, including the Scranton Fringe Festival (a performing arts festival held in the downtown section of the city in fall). Scranton's primary concert venue is the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain, a partially covered amphitheater that seats 17,500. Its summer concerts have included James Taylor, Dave Matthews Band, and many other musical acts. Scranton Cultural Center at the Masonic Temple is an impressive piece of architecture which houses several auditoriums and a large ballroom. It hosts the Northeast Philharmonic, Broadway Theater and other touring performances. In popular culture A banner promoting Dunder Mifflin, the fictional paper company on NBC's The Office, hangs in downtown Scranton. The Harry Chapin song \\"30,000 Pounds of Bananas\\" is about an actual fatal 1965 accident in Scranton, where a driver hauling bananas lost control of his truck as it barreled down Moosic Street. The city is the location of the Scranton branch of a fictional paper company Dunder Mifflin on NBC's series The Office. The Scranton branch is the setting for the majority of the show's episodes. The city is imagined as a member of the class of interstellar Okies in James Blish's 1962 novel, A Life for the Stars, in which 2273 AD Scranton, equipped with a space drive, flies away and leaves an impoverished Earth behind. In 2017, Scranton got national recognition from late night television host John Oliver when he made jokes about how infatuated Scranton community members were with the little train that runs during the weather reports on Scranton's ABC-affiliated TV station WNEP-TV. The train had been featured in multiple of their Talkback16 segments. After a followup segment, Oliver donated a train set to WNEP. It was too big for their backyard, so they donated it to The Electric City Trolley Museum. Transportation The main highways that serve Scranton are Interstate 81, which runs North to Binghamton, New York and Ontario and south to Wilkes- Barre, Harrisburg and Tennessee; Interstate 84, which runs east to Milford and New England States; Interstate 380, which runs southeast to Pocono Pines and Interstate 80 east to New York City and west to San Francisco; Interstate 476/Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension, which runs south to Allentown and Philadelphia; U.S. Route 6, which runs east to Carbondale/Honesdale and parallel to I-84 to New England States and west to Erie; and U.S. Route 11, which runs parallel to I-81. Scranton's provider of public transportation is the County of Lackawanna Transit System (COLTS). COLTS buses provide extensive service within the city and more limited service that reaches in all directions to Carbondale, Daleville, Pittston, and Fleetville. The other bussing company is the Luzerne County Transportation Authority (LCTA), which mainly runs through The Minooka section (closest to Luzerne County) and Downtown Scranton by The Mall at Steamtown. LCTA takes passengers from Scranton to the Mohegan Sun Pocono racino in Plains The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport is located in nearby Avoca. The airport is serviced by American Airlines, Delta, and United. Martz Trailways and Greyhound Lines provide coach bus transportation from its downtown station to New York City, Philadelphia and other places in the Northeast. Private operators such as Posten Taxi and McCarthy Flowered Cabs service the Scranton area. They are hired by telephone through central dispatch and cannot be hailed on the street as in larger cities. Railroads Rail transportation, in both freight and passenger, were vital to the city's historic growth. The city was a hub, serving the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DLW), and the Erie Railroad, with routes radiating in all directions, to New York State's Southern Tier, to several points in Pennsylvania, and to parts in northern New Jersey. The CNJ station and the DLW station were the last to lose passenger service, in the early 1950s and in 1970, respectively. Freight rail remains important vital today in Scranton. The Norfolk Southern Railway runs freight trains on the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western (DL&W;) line between Scranton and Binghamton, having taken over operations from the Canadian Pacific Railway (Delaware and Hudson Railway division) in 2015. The Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad serves the former DL&W; Keyser Valley branch in the city. The Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad, as designated operator of county-owned rail lines, oversees the former Delaware and Hudson line from Scranton north to Carbondale, the former DL&W; line east to the Delaware Water Gap and the former Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad third-rail interurban streetcar line south to Montage Mountain, Moosic. These lines host the seasonal passenger trains of both the Steamtown National Historic Site and the Electric City Trolley Museum and are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority. The PNRRA was created by Lackawanna County and Monroe County to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in Northeastern Pennsylvania, including one formerly owned by Conrail running from Scranton, through the Pocono Mountains towards New Jersey and the New York City market. One of its primary objectives is to re-establish rail passenger service to Hoboken, New Jersey and thence by connection to New York. Indeed, regular passenger train service to Scranton is slated to be restored under a plan to extend NJ Transit service from Hoboken via the Lackawanna Cut- Off. That project is ongoing. The trains would pass the Lackawanna Station building and pull in at a new Scranton station on Lackawanna Avenue along the northernmost track east of Bridge 60 (the railroad bridge over the Lackawanna River) and the Cliff Street underpass.NEW JERSEY ‚Äì PENNSYLVANIA LACKAWANNA CUT-OFF PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE RESTORATION PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration and NEW JERSEY TRANSIT in Cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, June 2008.

Formerly, coal mining and silk manufacturing provided employment for the people of Throop, who numbered 2,204 in 1900 and 5,133 in 1910. In 1940, 7,382 people lived in Throop.

It is bordered to the northeast by Olyphant, to the north by Blakely, to the northwest by Dickson City, to the west by Scranton, and to the south by Dunmore. History and notable features On April 7, 1911, a fire at the Price-Pancoast Colliery killed 72 coal miners in what has been described as \\"the most appalling mine disaster in the history of the northern anthracite coal fields.\\" The borough contains a lead-contaminated parcel of land commonly known as the Marjol Battery site. Now owned by Gould Electronics, the empty land was a former battery processing facility closed in April 1982. Since the late 1980s, the federal United States Environmental Protection Agency and the state DEP have worked to clean up contamination in adjacent areas, but a final remedy for the site itself has remained on hold in recent years, as local officials and citizens fight with the government agencies and Gould over the best solution. In the meantime, the landowner has maintained a policy of basic containment and monitoring. Throop's most popular summertime event is its annual Cow Flop, organized by the Throop Booster Club. It has been a tradition in Throop since the late 1980s. The Flop serves as a fundraiser for the club and usually raises about $10,000 annually to benefit youth baseball and softball programs in the borough. The Flop, formerly held on a Sunday in late June, is now a two-day (since 2007) event that features a parade, fireworks, music, food, and other entertainment. The event requires more than 100 volunteers, mostly members of the Booster Club and parents of Throop athletes, to produce. The main event of the Cow Flop is the raffle involving 2,000 squares and a cow's pick as to where she will relieve herself. Raffle tickets are $10 and the winner of the annual Flop raffle wins $5,000.

It is in the central area of the county, and it immediately surrounds Lancaster City. As of the 2010 census, the township population was 16,149. Lancaster Township is one of the six immediate suburbs of the city of Lancaster, all sharing the same official designation as Lancaster, Pennsylvania, by the United States Postal Service. History Lancaster Township was established in 1729 as one of seventeen original townships in Lancaster County. It was the smallest of the townships, with its boundaries being defined by the Conestoga River, Manor Township, the Little Conestoga Creek, (East) Hempfield Township, and Manheim Township. A two-mile square was later cut out of the northern part of Lancaster Township to create the county seat of Lancaster City. The creation of the county caused an influx of people to come to Lancaster City, and Lancaster Township, its closest suburb, received many people too, with many people living here and working in the city. As Lancaster became larger and more prominent, larger roads and railroads needed to extend out to its suburbs, including Lancaster Township. The town even had its own canal, the Conestoga Navigation Canal on the Conestoga River. Lancaster Township's growth was slow but steady, with about 150 people joining the community each decade prior to 1900. Since then, as the Industrial Revolution came to a close, Lancaster Township has been transformed into a mostly residential municipality. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all of it land. It is bounded by the Conestoga River to the south and east, and its tributary, Little Conestoga Creek, to the west. Most of the township lies to west and south of the city of Lancaster, but smaller exclaves of the township lie to the east and southeast of the city. Its neighboring municipalities are Manheim Township, the city of Lancaster, East Lampeter Township, Pequea Township, the borough of Millersville, Manor Township, and East Hempfield Township.Lancaster County, Pennsylvania#Municipalitieshttp://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/general_ref/cousub_outline/cen2k_pgsz/pa_cosub.pdf The township contains the village of Bausman, an unincorporated community that has its own post office and ZIP code (17504), while the rest of the township is covered by 17603 and 17602. Other named locations in the township are School Lane Hills, Woodlawn, Hamilton Park, Colonial Manor, Wabank, Engleside, and Conestoga Woods. The township is home to President James Buchanan's summer residence, Wheatland, located at 1120 Marietta Avenue. The 1828 Federal-style mansion is a National Historic Landmark and has been restored to reflect the period of Buchanan's occupancy in the mid-19th century. Wheatland is featured within the township's seal. Government and politics Lancaster Township is governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors, who serve staggered six-year terms.{{cite web http://www.twp.lancaster.pa.us/supervisors/board-of- supervisors The current supervisors are Steven Elliott (chair), Benjamin Bamford (vice-chair) and Iber Guerrero Lopez (treasurer). Their terms expire at the end of 2024, 2022, and 2026, respectively. In the municipal election on November 3, 2009, Tony Allen was defeated in his bid for a fourth term as supervisor by Democrat Benjamin Bamford in a very close race. Initial results gave Bamford an 11-vote margin of victory, or less than one-half of one percent of votes cast. Unofficial results had 1,188 votes for Bamford to 1,177 votes for Allen. After 27 registered voters petitioned the elections board, a later manual recount increased Bamford's margin to 13 votes out of 2,371 votes cast, with 1,192 votes for Bamford to Allen's 1,179 (50.2% to 49.8%). In a county with a strong history of voting for Republicans,Lancaster County, Pennsylvania#Government and politics Bamford's victory made history. When Bamford took office, Lancaster Township became the first township in the county to be governed by a board that was majority Democratic.

They had a hard time thinking of a new name, though finally John Jamison, one of the oldest and most prominent citizens, proposed that it be called Little Britain Township in memory of most of the settlers' mother country. For over one hundred years, Little Britain Township's boundaries remained unchanged, until 1844 when Fulton Township was formed.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 19,612.  History to 1763 Manor Township takes its name from the Manor of Conestoga, which was originally surveyed and reserved for William Penn in 1719, although there is evidence that William Penn visited this area prior to 1690. At this time, the area was Susquehannock territory, and the Susquehannock tribe themselves were the largest tribe in the Susquehanna Valley and had their center of the community within the Turkey Hill part of this territory. The Quaker government thus had surveyors lay off a large area bounded by the Little Conestoga Creek near what is now Millersville to the Susquehanna River and the Conestoga Creek. When the land was ceded by William Penn to their ancestors in the 1690s, the Susquehannock tribe had lived on the land for quite some time. Their ancestors were Conestoga Native Americans, many of whom were Christian and had lived peacefully with their European neighbors for decades by bartering handicrafts, hunting, and receiving subsistence food given them by the Pennsylvania government. The area was called the Manor of Conestoga and may have been (as some historians speculate that it was) set aside by William Penn as a domain in which the Susquehannock tribe could live and hunt. The Manor contained 16,000 acres east of the Susquehanna River, thus being mostly well-watered flat land that contained rich and fertile soil. Until the French and Indian War, however, the frontier of Pennsylvania remained largely unsettled. In the aftermath of the war, a new wave of Scots-Irish immigrants who are now known locally as \\"The Paxton Boys\\" encroached on the Penn-ceded land in the back country, often doing so in blatant violation of previously-signed treaties. Reverend John Elder, who was the parson at Paxtang, became a leader of these settlers, was known as the \\"Fighting Parson\\", and kept his rifle in the pulpit while he delivered his sermons. Elder then helped organize the settlers into a mounted militia and was named Captain of the group, whom called themselves the \\"Pextony boys\\" and claimed that the Natives often raided their homes and killed men, women and children. Although there had been neither Susquehannock nor Conestoga attacks in the area, the Pextony Boys claimed that the Conestoga secretly provided aid and intelligence to their enemies. At daybreak on December 14, 1763, the vigilante group of the Scots-Irish frontiersmen attacked Conestoga homes at Conestoga Town (near present-day Millersville) and scalped and otherwise mutilated the males, raped and murdered the women and children, and burned their cabins, massacring all but 16 of the Natives. The colonial government then held an inquest, and the new governor, John Penn, offered a reward for capture of the Pextony Boys. Penn placed the remaining sixteen Conestoga in protective custody in Lancaster, though the Pextony Boys broke in on December 27, 1763 and murdered as well as dismembered six adults and eight children. The government of Pennsylvania offered a new reward after this second attack, this time $600, for the capture of anyone involved, but the attackers were never identified. Manor Township therefore still memorializes the murdered Natives by using as its official logo a Native American Chief in full headdress with the date 1763 below it. 1763 to 1863 For the next 100 years, the township was subdivided as the large plantations in were cut into smaller tracts to accommodate growing families. In 1846, the 83rd year, the iron industry came to the Township in 1846 when the Iron Works factory was built in the village of Safe Harbor. The Iron Works factory provided jobs for heads of the households as well as the T-shaped rail that was the principal product of the mill. When the Civil War came close to Manor Township in 1863, the 100th year, Governor Curtin called every able-bodied man to enroll for the defense of the entire State of Pennsylvania. Citizens of Manor Township and Millersville assembled at the headquarters at Safe Harbor, although the invasion threat to Lancaster County ended as the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge was burned and Lee's army was defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg. 1863 and thereafter By 1880, the population of Manor Township was approximately 4,000 people. From the late 1800s through the mid 1900s, the township was known for producing fine tobacco crops, and its farmers produced more tobacco than any township in Lancaster County. Churches and schools were built as the area continued to grow, and the railroad along the western boundary of the township enabled the development of more factories, including a woolen factory near Safe Harbor, match factory in Safe Harbor, and an implement factory near Millersville. In April 1930, construction began on the dam for the Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and was completed twenty months later. In 1973, Washington Boro officially merged into Manor Township, and most of Manor Township has remained rural and agricultural in use. The land is considered by soil scientists to be as fertile as any in the United States, and the vast majority of development has occurred in the north eastern section of the Township. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 20.70%, are water.

History On January 11, 1814, Isaac Rohrer laid out the town that became known as Mountville, dividing it into 130 building lots, sold by lottery. Located east of Columbia in West Hempfield Township on the Lancaster and Susquehanna Turnpike, Mountville was originally named \\"Mount Pleasant\\" because it was situated on an elevation affording a pleasant view of the surrounding countryside in every direction. In 1842, when the first post office was established in the town, the name was changed to \\"Mountville\\" because the postal service already had another Mount Pleasant registered in Pennsylvania. Recognizing the need for a municipal water system, the town incorporated as a borough in 1906. After several annexations of land adjoining the borough through the years since, Mountville now consists of just under one square mile of residential, commercial, industrial and public property. Mountville boasts one of the highest ratios of public park space per capita. With slightly more than 2,800 residents, the borough is served by the West Hempfield Township Police Department, protected by the Mountville Volunteer Fire Company, and educated by the Hempfield School District.

The population was 8,260 at the 2010 census. History The township derives its name from Donegal, a town in Ireland. The original township of Donegal was organized by the court of Chester County in 1722, and was one of the two townships which composed Lancaster County at the time of its erection in 1729. On the 24th of June, 1838, a division was effected, whereby the old township was constituted into two townships, to be separately and distinctly recognized as East Donegal and West Donegal. The settlers of West Donegal were of Scots-Irish descent and were primarily farmers who were drawn to the area by the rich soils and plentiful streams. Thus the abundant produce provided by the land was able to be made into flour by the many mills which sprang up in the area. Early settlers, Arthur Patterson and others, organized a Presbyterian Church at Donegal in 1726, and erected the old church edifice at that time. The first three pastors of it were from Scotland. Bartram Galbraith, grandson of James Galbraith, was Lieutenant for Lancaster County, the first three years of the Revolution, and many members of that family served in various official positions, as also did Alexander Lowrey and several of that family.http://www.eastdonegaltwp.com/about/ Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all of it recorded as land.

The population was 1,502 at the 2010 census. History Big Beaver Township was established as one of the thirteen townships in Lawrence County. Initially, Big Beaver Township included what is now the borough of Wampum. Wampum became a separate borough on February 19, 1876, the same year that the Wampum Cement and Lime Company began. It is worth noting that the cement plant was located outside the borough of Wampum in what remained as Big Beaver Township. There were five schools in Big Beaver Township in 1875. There were approximately 266 enrolled students. The average attendance was 170 and the school term was seven months. The area of Big Beaver Township suffered growth and loss over the next seventy five years. Two world wars and several depressions saw the population and industry decline. The Borough of Wampum, in search of a larger tax base, decided to annex the Medusa Cement Plant from Big Beaver Township. At that time, according to Pennsylvania state law, a township could not prevent a borough from annexing property and Wampum succeeded in annexing the property into Wampum. Shortly after this, the Borough of Ellwood began to consider annexing the property south of the cement plant. In 1958, the township trustees began the process of changing Big Beaver Township into the Borough of New Beaver in order to prevent the further annexation. The charter was signed on November 18, 1959, however the community continued to operate as a township until elections could be held in 1961.

It is northwest of Pittsburgh near the Pennsylvania‚ÄìOhio border just southeast of Youngstown, Ohio. The population was 23,128 as of the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the New Castle, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 91,108 in 2010. New Castle also anchors the northwestern part of the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-WV-OH Combined Statistical Area. It is the commercial center of a fertile agricultural region. As of 2019 U.S. Census estimates, the city had a population of 21,618. This is an approximate decline of 1,476 residents since the 2010 U.S. Census. History In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, traveled to western Pennsylvania to resurvey the \\"donation lands\\", which had been reserved for veterans of the Revolutionary War. He discovered that the original survey had neglected to stake out approximately at the confluence of the Shenango River and Neshannock Creek, at that time a part of Allegheny County. The Indian town of Kuskusky was listed on early maps in this location. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out in April 1798 what was to become the town of New Castle. It comprised approximately that same , in what was then part of Allegheny County. In 1825, New Castle became a borough, having a population of about 300. The city later became a part of Mercer County. On April 5, 1849, the governor of Pennsylvania signed an act creating Lawrence County, named in honor of U.S. Navy Captain James Lawrence. New Castle became a city in 1869 and was headed by its first mayor, Thomas B. Morgan. At that time, the population had increased to about 6,000. In 1849, a group of Old Order Amish families from Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, settled just north of New Castle in New Wilmington. Later migrations from Holmes County, Ohio, would make this Amish community one of the largest in Pennsylvania. Approximately 2,000 Amish live and work presently in the townships north of New Castle. Business in New Castle began to flourish in the early 19th century with the construction of the Beaver and Erie Canal system, which made its way through the city. Numerous manufacturing plants became located in New Castle because of the availability of transportation facilities and ready access to raw material markets. The canal system was later supplemented and then replaced by railroads which offered greater speed and capacity for freight, as well as year-round service. In the 1870s, the city became a major hub of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. New Castle's population swelled from 11,600 in 1890 to 28,339 in 1900, and to 38,280 in 1910, as immigrants, particularly from Italy, flocked to the city to work in the mills and nearby limestone quarries.Watkins, John, The Big Stunts of Great Detectives: The Scrapbook, Vol. 4, No. 6, New York: Frank A. Munsey (December 1907), p. 1098. Italian laborers of the era were frequent victims of the Black Hand society, which employed blackmail and extortion to rob the workers of their pay. In 1907 the headquarters of the Black Hand for the entire region was discovered in the village of Hillsville a few miles west of New Castle. By this time New Castle was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, and with the construction of the largest tin plate mill in America, the city became the tin plate capital of the world. The tin plate industry marked a new increase in the city's prosperity. In 1908 New Castle was linked to Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. Steel and paper mills, foundries, a bronze bushing factory, and car-construction plants contributed to the economy. In addition, the Shenango China produced commercial china and created the fine Castleton China line for the White House, including dinnerware for Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. Other ceramic factories produced bathroom fixtures and industrial refractory materials. In the 1920s, New Castle enjoyed its greatest prosperity. The landscape of the city was transformed with the building of many beautiful structures, some of which still stand, such as the Scottish Rite Cathedral, St. Mary's Church, and the Castleton Hotel. The city also established its identity. New Castle is known both as the \\"hot dog capital of the world\\" and the \\"fireworks capital of America\\". Its chili dogs are the product of Greek immigrants who came to New Castle in the early 20th century and established restaurants along with their homes. The renown for fireworks is credited to two local fireworks companies of international stature, S.Vitale Pyrotechnic Industries, Inc. (Pyrotecnico) and Zambelli Internationale. The first fireworks manufacturer in New Castle was Leopold Fazzoni, who owned and operated the Fazzoni Brothers Fireworks Company. Fazzoni came to New Castle from Italy in 1886 and worked in the tin mills to earn enough money to start his own business. He was issued the first certificate for fireworks manufacturing in the state. Of the people who worked with the Fazzoni family, many founded their own businesses, such as Paul Rozzi, Jacob Conti, Constantino Vitale, and Joseph Zambelli. Despite recent economic challenges, the city continues to serve as the headquarters of Pyrotecnico Fireworks, the winner of the 2008 Gold Jupiter, awarded at the world's most prestigious fireworks venue: LaRonde in Montreal, Canada. The company was started by Constantino Vitale in Italy in 1889, who immigrated to New Castle in the 1920s, continuing his business there. Five generations of the Vitale family have transformed the company. In the 1990s the company's name was changed to Pyrotecnico and has grown to be a world leader in the industry. Also located in New Castle is Zambelli Fireworks, which was founded in New Castle. Zambelli Fireworks is one of the world's leading fireworks and pyrotechnics companies. These fireworks companies have been featured in venues such as presidential celebrations and Super Bowls. Pyrotecnico and Zambelli Fireworks have changed the face of the fireworks industry. This has gained the city the nickname of \\"Fireworks Capital of America\\". New Castle has recently opened Zambelli Plaza near the Cascade Center in 2007 in honor of the Zambelli family's accomplishments. In the 1930s, the city, along with most cities of America, suffered during the Great Depression. During this time, the federal government established the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). These programs offered jobs to many displaced workers. Many of the stone walls built by the WPA and the CCC still stand as a reminder of the historic demise of the economy. In the 1940s, industry temporarily surged during wartime. In 1950, the population peaked at 48,834, but became part of the Rust Belt, with population dwindling to 28,334 by 1990. New Castle is the county seat of Lawrence County which has a population of approximately 91,000. In 1998, New Castle was a host city for the History Channel Great Race.

Economy The Pier I Complex Building in downtown New Castle Downtown New Castle underwent a redevelopment centered around the Cascade Center. The downtown streets and sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 21st century in earlier styles. The revitalization of downtown also saw two major routes into the city, Pennsylvania Route 65 and U.S. Route 224, which had both had their termini extended into downtown in 2007. InfoCision, a telemarketing services company, restored the former New Castle Dry Goods Co. building, into which it relocated its offices from their former location inside Cascade Galleria. The building had been vacant since the late 1980s when the Troutman's department store closed. The building is now known as the Pier I Complex Building. The downtown area has also become the home of several bank offices, hosting the regional headquarters of Huntington and First Commonwealth (all descended from banks formerly based in the city but later acquired) as well as branches for PNC Bank and First National Bank. FirstMerit also had its regional headquarters in New Castle prior to their acquisition by Huntington, and that building is expected to be town down in 2020. Mellon Bank also had offices across the street from the current Zambelli Plaza before selling off its New Castle-area branches to First National Bank, which closed the office building since it already had the aforementioned branch in downtown.

The city was the site of an important development in the history of the Warner Bros. empire, given that the first Warner Brothers' theatre, the Cascade, opened here in 1907. (The Warners, most of whom were Polish Jewish immigrants, resided in Youngstown, Ohio.) The building was nearly condemned in 1996 after a wall fell on the sidewalk near East Washington Street (one of the city's main thoroughfares) before its historical significance was discovered, saving the building. Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood donated $150,000, which the state of Pennsylvania matched, to restore the facade. Municipal officials have planned recent revitalization efforts around the historic site. The Cascade Center currently features two restaurants and a local stage theater, and plans are in progress to turn the complex into New Castle's version of Station Square in Pittsburgh. This revitalization plan, however, will focus on motion pictures rather than railroads. The Cascade Center is named after Cascade Park, located on the outskirts of the city's East Side in Shenango Township along Pennsylvania Route 65. A former trolley park, it was restored and converted into a regular outdoor park in the 1980s with a few historical buildings as well as the park's entrance sign restored, avoiding the fate of nearby Idora Park in Youngstown. The park hosts the annual \\"Back to the 50s Weekend\\" classic car show, and previously hosted the similarly themed \\"Thunder in the Cascades\\" motorcycle show until concerns about nudity and alcohol use at the event as opposed to the more family-friendly \\"Back to the 50s Weekend\\" had the event moved to the Lawrence County Fairgrounds in nearby Hickory Township in the early 21st century. The New Castle Playhouse, a community theatre, is located along Long Avenue and puts on several shows a year. It is one of only a few such theatres between Youngstown and theatre-rich Pittsburgh. The Old Princeton School, located nearby, has been the venue for rock concerts. In the 2011 movie Super 8, New Castle is referenced as the \\"fireworks capital of the world\\". New Castle is the subject of the true crime blog \\"Small Town Noir\\", which uses mug shots taken in New Castle between 1930 and 1960, and which were rescued when the town's police department threw them out. The information on the images comes from the New Castle News. New Castle has a large Arab- American population whose culture is visible throughout the community. Large numbers of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants were attracted by the city's prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their culture is especially visible in the local cuisine, which makes popular use of items such as stuffed grape leaves, lamb on the rod, kibbe, and garlic sauce. Although many other Rust Belt cities contain large Arab-American populations, New Castle is unique for its large population of Alawite Muslims from Syria. The Muslim community of the city has a mosque on the East Side of town.  Healthcare  New Castle's only hospital is UPMC Jameson, located at the intersection of Wilmington Avenue and Garfield Street. Medicare reimbursements per enrollee were $11,153 in 2014, but $11,196 in 2013. Medicare reimbursements per enrollee in Lawrence County are $1,565 more than national average. Notable people * W.

Because of this, the group has chosen to focus on these areas (arts, education, environment, people) as the pillars for nurturing and fostering growth. It is believed that these qualities are unique to the community, deserve to be recognized, and should be given a larger platform for actualization.

The population was 168 at the 2010 census. It is surrounded by Old Order Amish farms of the New Wilmington settlement. History The land on which the borough of Volant currently sits on was bought from the Native Americans in 1784. The first gristmill was built on Neshannock Creek in 1806, upstream from the current site. It was abandoned after a few years, and a new mill was built in 1812 at its current location. In 1847 an Amish settlement was established between New Wilmington and Volant. In 1868, J.P. Locke purchased the mill and of land and began laying out a settlement of 30 lots, which he called Lockeville. With the help of the railroad, his attempts to create a settlement were successful. Lockeville began to grow and prosper, and in June 1893 the settlement changed its name to Volant and was incorporated as a self-governing unit. The first store was built in 1877 by John and William Graham. By the turn of the 20th century the village was a bustling commercial community. Thanks to the New Castle-Franklin railroad Volant became a popular shopping district. The mill remained the nucleus of the town. Because of Volant's rural location there was a livery stable, two harness shops, a blacksmith and a veterinarian, as well as some shops. In addition, there was a college which attracted students from the surrounding communities. As the town progressed toward establishing larger business ventures, a stone quarry was begun around 1900, as well as a lumber mill and brick company. The growing need for petroleum spurred an oil boom north of Volant. The drilling continued until the beginning of World War I. With the Great Depression came a gradual decline of the economy. As the economy worsened the business district diminished to almost nothing. The mill, which was primarily responsible for Volant's success, closed its doors in the early 1960s, and the trains stopped running through Volant in 1975. Volant soon became forgotten and returned to its rural roots. In 1984, a renaissance began with the old mill as its centerpiece. Opening its doors for the first time in over 20 years as a country gift and antique store, it paved the way for a business revival that still continues. Encouraged by its success, other shops were opened on Main Street. After several years of rapid growth, there are now over 50 shops and restaurants, turning Volant from a sleepy little village into one of western Pennsylvania's most popular tourist attractions.

It is part of the Lebanon, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,112 at the 2010 census. History Cornwall was initially settled by Peter Grubb in 1734. Peter was a Chester County stonemason who came to, what was then Lancaster County, in search of high quality stone for quarrying. First building his house and then a store, he discovered magnetite iron ore nearby and decided to test its quality, he found the ore to be exceedingly pure. Grubb wrote to Philadelphia and in 1734 was granted a warrant to purchase of land. For three years Peter followed veins of ore until he found a large deposit that was easily accessible; however, this ore was not within the bounds of his property. So in 1737 he purchased an additional of land. In 1742 Peter built a cold blast furnace and named it Cornwall, after his father's birthplace in England. The Cornwall Iron Mine was, at one time, the largest open-pit mining operation in the world. They were mined continuously until June 30, 1973, totaling 236 years of production. Finding the necessary components nearby for smelting iron (water, limestone and timber for charcoal), Grubb built the Cornwall Iron Furnace and began production in 1742. The operation also included the Hopewell Forges on nearby Hammer Creek. Peter Grubb did not stay long to run the operation, but leased it out in 1745 for 20 years and returned to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1765 Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. took over the operation, and in 1798 it passed to Robert Coleman and his family. Cornwall Furnace was in production from 1742 until 1883, and appears today much as it was when production ended. In 1932 the Coleman family deeded the property to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and it is now a designated National Historic Landmark open to the public.

History  The first European settlers were German-Swiss Protestants, particularly Lutherans, who began clearing and farming the land in the early 18th century. Even today, most residents can trace their ancestry to one or more of those early settlers. The native Indian population was quickly driven north into the Appalachian Mountains, although conflicts between natives and settlers were recorded as late as 1756. This area was originally part of Lebanon Township of Lancaster County and then Annville Township of Lebanon County. North Annville became a separate township in 1845, and its borders have remained unchanged since then, except for the southern edge, which was incorporated into the town of Annville in 1912. The main industry has always been farming. Many of the farms, dairy and livestock, have passed from generation to generation for more than a hundred years. The countryside is dotted with small residential communities, the largest of which are Bellegrove, Water Works, and Steelstown. Apart from a few family-owned businesses, the only major employer is a limestone quarry, which mines the high-calcium geological formation known as the Annville Belt.

It is part of the Lebanon, Pennsylvania Metropolitan statistical area. The population was 7,320 at the 2010 census. Geography Palmyra is located at (40.307960, -76.593782). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Palmyra is located in the Lebanon Valley between Annville and Hershey. Situated on the western edge of Lebanon County, the borough is west of Lebanon, and east of Harrisburg. The village of Campbelltown is only south of Palmyra, and carries a Palmyra mailing address. Although no water source runs directly through the borough, the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring, and Swatara Creeks are all nearby. Palmyra has a humid continental climate. Geology Geologist William E. Kochanov wrote an extensive report on the geology of the Palmyra area as part of the 1995 publication, Karst Geohazards. In his article, Kochanov discusses how the geology of the region contributes to the high number of sinkholes found in the area. Palmyra lies in the eastern section of the Great Valley, locally known as the Lebanon Valley. The specific formation beneath Palmyra is an Ordovician Epler Formation, characterized by a high number of surface depressions and sinkholes. These features serve as natural drains, allowing any water on the surface to permeate the soil and run underground into water tables or into local springs or creeks. The development of the borough has interrupted the natural drainage systems present in the Epler Formation. Palmyra is, in reality, a waterless community. All of the natural drainage ways, including the Killinger, Quittapahilla, Spring and Swatara Creeks, lie outside the borough's municipal borders. The storm water runoff is directed outside the borough via a multitude of ways, and it is these discharge areas in which the appearance of sinkholes is most prevalent. Residents and legislators met in October 1993 to discuss possible solutions to the recurring sinkhole problems. The installation of a storm sewer system was widely supported, but the estimated $10 million cost was a major hurdle. Since the meeting, several projects have been introduced to correct some of the water flow problems of the borough. History=Early settlement The land on which Palmyra rests was originally home to the Lenape and Susquehannock tribes. The first European explorers and traders came to the region around 1650. Settlers were drawn to the area because of its rich land and abundance of fish and game. Additionally, being part of William Penn‚Äôs colony, his charter providing civil rights and religious freedom also attracted settlers to the area. In the beginning of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania‚Äôs settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or squatting. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating when they came to the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, it is clear that the first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates. The Scotch-Irish immigrants left their homelands due to a number of political, economic and religious reasons. As expected, they were clannish, and tended not to mix with the other ethnic groups settling the area at the same time. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area. A majority of the Scotch-Irish were Presbyterian, and they established several churches as they moved westward across the state. Examples of the churches they built include Derry near Hershey, Donegal in Lancaster County, Paxtang near Harrisburg, and Silver Spring near Carlisle. As the years passed, many of the Scotch-Irish continued westward, leaving the Lebanon Valley. Of the first Scotch-Irish settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Aspey, Campbell, Caruthers, Ewing, Galbraith, McCallen, McClure, McCord, Mitchell, Sawyer, Walker and Wilson are recorded. The German Palatinates who settled in Pennsylvania, erroneously known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands for a number of reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and economically they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch- Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil. Of the first German settlers in the Palmyra area, the surnames of Bindnagle, Bowman, Carmany, Deininger, Early, Forney, Gingrich, Hemperly, Hetrick, Kettering, Killinger, Naftzger, Nye, Ober, Ricker, and Zimmerman are recorded. The Palmyra area, as well as the entire western edge of the European colonies, was susceptible to attack from the tribes of natives living in the region. In their histories of Lebanon County, Rupp and Egle note many raids that took place in what is now northern Lebanon County. In 1756, the Provincial government decided to build a chain of forts stretching from the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in the west to the Delaware River at Easton in the east. These forts were built at regular intervals, roughly ten to apart, and in any major gaps along the mountains. One of these forts, Fort Swatara, was built by Capt. Frederick Smith near modern-day Inwood where the Swatara Creek flows through the Blue Mountain. By the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the frequency and intensity of native attacks diminished. Johannes Palm, whose name is often anglicized to John Palm, is given credit for founding Palmyra. He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, serving as a doctor and soldier in the Revolutionary War. In June 1766, Palm secured the 100-acre plot of land originally surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1951 and previously owned by Conrad Raisch. This plot was roughly bounded by the present-day Railroad Street, Maple Street and the Dauphin County line. By 1776, Palm had drawn up drafts for a settlement he called ‚ÄúPalmstown‚Äù, with his residence located on the 100-Block of West Main Street. Growth of Palmstown The settlement's Post Office was established on April 1, 1804. The name of the town submitted to the Postal Service was ‚ÄúPalmstown‚Äù, in honor of Johannes Palm. Yet in 1806, there are records of a tract of land located on both sides of Main Street purchased by John Kean with the settlement being referred to as ‚ÄúPalmyra‚Äù, most likely referencing the Roman outpost of Palmyra in Syria. Although both names were used for a time, the popularity of ‚ÄúPalmyra‚Äù had spread and became the official name of the settlement by 1810. Transportation from one settlement to the next was essential if either settlement wanted to grow. Turnpike companies were chartered to create improved roads to better facilitate the movement of goods from town to town. Governor Thomas McKean authorized the formation of the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike in 1805. This route was to connect Reading and Hummelstown and employed the main east-west thoroughfare through Palmyra. Upon its opening in 1817, Palmyra gained a direct connection to its neighbors Millerstown (now Annville) and Derry (now Hershey), and to the larger markets in eastern Pennsylvania. The Berks and Dauphin Turnpike existed as a toll road until 1917 and now forms part of US 422. The Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819. This ran through Campbelltown just south of Palmyra and later became part of US 322. Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, which is now PA 117. With the opening of these routes, and the incorporation of Harrisburg as the State Capital in 1812, more and more traffic moved through the Palmyra area. The passage of more travelers encouraged taverns and hotels to be built in Palmyra to accommodate them. In the first decades of the 19th century, Palmyra had five taverns and three hotels to serve the needs of those moving through the area. Blacksmith shops, general stores and other small business also began to pop up in Palmyra to serve both travelers and locals alike. The demand of greater speed and tonnage of goods being moved prompted the building of the Union Canal. Completed in 1827, the Union Canal connected the Schuylkill River at Reading to the Susquehanna River at Middletown. The canal passed just north of Palmyra, and the settlement's citizens benefited from the increased traffic. The canal was later widened to allow larger boats to pass through in 1849. The Age of Steam also came to Palmyra in 1857, as the first locomotives ran through the settlement on the Lebanon Valley Railroad in that year. Two years later, the Lebanon Valley Railroad merged with the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to form the Reading Railroad. The growth of rail traffic signaled the end for the Union Canal, and for the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike as a toll road. Since the Civil War First Evangelical Church Palmyra continued to grow steadily through the 19th & 20th Centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings. By 1875, the population had increased to 500 people in about 100 dwellings. By 1890, the population had skyrocketed in just fifteen years to 1,760 people. And by 1960, the population had reached 7,000. With the fall of Fort Sumter in 1861 to the Confederate Army, President Abraham Lincoln called on volunteers to preserve the Union. About 78 men from the Palmyra area answered the President's call, and donned the blue uniforms of the Union. After the Civil War concluded in 1865, a variety of new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town's first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled ‚ÄúThe Londonderry Gazette‚Äù. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, paper box factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a feed mill was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of Milton S. Hershey‚Äôs chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area. Landis Shoe Company Building In 1899, the Lebanon Valley Street Railway Company was formed to provide transit across the length of Lebanon County. The trolley line reached Palmyra in 1904. By this time, the Hershey Trolley Company had also formed, and soon thereafter connected to the Lebanon Valley Line at the square in Palmyra. This trolley connected lasted until 1933, when the Lebanon Valley system switched to bus services. By 1946, the Hershey Line also folded. The Landis Shoe Company Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. 250th anniversary Palmyra celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2010. A committee was formed to plan the commemoration and among other duties, selected the official logo for the anniversary. The design, which is modeled on the Pennsylvania state seal and features the official orange and black colors of the Palmyra School District. Visit the official anniversary website to view an image of the winning logo. Culture=In popular culture The 2000 film Lucky Numbers, starring John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow had multiple scenes shot throughout Palmyra. The main street of town was closed to traffic so that scenes could be shot. Dozens of onlookers watched Kudrow and Travolta cruise through the square in a red convertible. Economy Due to its position between Harrisburg and Lebanon, and the popularity of neighboring Hershey, Palmyra is economically prosperous. Palmyra is the headquarters for several companies, including ASK Foods, Inc., Dechert Dynamics Corp., Klick- Lewis, Inc., and the Palmyra Bologna Co., Inc., which produces Seltzer's Lebanon Bologna.

Education The first two free public schools opened in Palmyra in 1840. Before this time, church schools and private schools served the children of Palmyra. In addition to the public schools, the Palmyra Academy, also known as the Witmer Academy after its founder, Peter B. Witmer, opened in 1857. The Palmyra Academy was praised as one of the best schools of its kind in the area. It prepared its students for continued education at colleges and universities, and educated students from all around the Susquehanna Valley and neighboring states. The Palmyra Academy closed its doors in 1890, and the Academy Building was torn down nine years later. Coming with the growth of the area and the formation of a Borough Government, the Palmyra Borough School District was created in 1913. The first building for the district was erected on South Railroad St. on October 12, 1915. A new secondary school serving grades seven through twelve was built on W. Cherry St. in 1937. In 1952, the directors of the Borough of Palmyra and North Londonderry Township agreed to operate their schools cooperatively, and three years later merged to create the Palmyra Area School District. In 1962, the schools of South Londonderry Township joined the Palmyra Area School District. Since its formation the district has served the Borough of Palmyra, and both North and South Londonderry Townships, including the villages of Campbelltown, Lawn, and Timber Hills. The Palmyra Area School District currently operates four elementary schools (Forge Road, Pine Street, Northside and Lingle Avenue), one middle school and one high school. All school buildings are located within the Borough of Palmyra, with the exceptions of the high school and Lingle Avenue Elementary, which are just south of the borough limits in North Londonderry Township.

History  George Taylor, signer of the Declaration of Independence, built a Georgian stone house in 1768 in what is now the borough of Catasauqua. Today, the George Taylor House is a National Historic Landmark, a showpiece of the community's rich historical heritage. In 1840, the anthracite iron industry was founded in what is now known as Catasauqua, originally Biery's Port, making it a birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the United States. Welsh immigrant David Thomas relocated to the area and opened the Crane Iron Works. Remembered as \\"the father of Catasauqua,\\" Thomas initially named the community Craneville, after his former employer in Wales. The Bridge Street Presbyterian Church in Catasauqua The wealthy, generous Thomases were responsible for many sweeping changes to the prosperity of the community. David Thomas founded the Presbyterian Church of Catasauqua, in which residents still worship today, and his wife Elizabeth donated money and land to found the Welsh Congregational Church, which no longer exists. Thomas organized Catasauqua's first fire company, installed its first public water system, and served as its first burgess. In 1854, the town was formally titled Catasauqua (pronounced \\"Cat-uh-SAW-kwuh\\"), from the Lenni Lenape language, meaning \\"dry ground\\" or \\"thirsty ground.\\" Catasauqua is home to two different neighborhoods listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One is Biery's Port, located along the Lehigh River and named for an early family of prominence; the other is known as \\"the mansion district,\\" and comprises Victorian homes once owned by wealthy residents. By 1900, Catasauqua boasted 5,000 residents, and had the highest percentage of self-made millionaires of any town in the United States. In 1917, while many of the young men of the town served in World War I, Catasauqua became the first community in the United States to raise $1 million in war bonds, earning it the nickname \\"The Million Dollar Town\\". Catasauqua observed its 150th anniversary of incorporation in 2004. In July 2014, the town also celebrated its 100th anniversary of the old home week celebration in 1914. The original old home week marked the 75th anniversary of the Lehigh Valley Crane Iron Works. Education The Borough is served by the Catasauqua Area School District.

History Emmaus Theatre in Emmaus Founding Emmaus was settled in the 1740s and dates its founding to 1759. Shelter House, the oldest building in the borough, was constructed in 1734. For approximately 100 years, until the mid-19th century, it was a closed community of the Moravian Church. The original land on which the town now lies was donated by Sebastian Heinrich Knauss and Jacob Ehrenhardt for use by the Moravian church. The founders and original residents of the town were members of the Lutheran and Reformed faiths, who joined the Moravian church when their own denominations were unable to provide ministers. Emmaus was one of the four leading Moravian communities in the northeast United States at the time of its founding; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Lititz, Pennsylvania and Nazareth, Pennsylvania were the three others. Origin and spelling of name The borough was named for the biblical village of Emmaus (now within modern Israel), where, according to the New Testament, Jesus was seen by his disciples Luke and Cleopas following his crucifixion and resurrection.Luke 24:12-35 From its founding in 1759 until 1830, the settlement's name was spelled \\"Emmaus.\\" From 1830 until 1938 the community used the Pennsylvania Dutch spelling of the name: \\"Emaus\\" with a line above the \\"m\\" to indicate a double letter. As English became the prevalent language in Pennsylvania the line often was omitted, leading to confusion about the correct spelling. In 1938, the local Rotary Club circulated petitions and the borough formally changed the spelling to \\"Emmaus,\\" matching the English King James Version. A major thoroughfare in the borough, Emaus Avenue, has retained the pre-1938 spelling, however. 19th century Iron ore was discovered nearby in the 19th century and served as a source of industrial growth for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1859, the East Pennsylvania Railroad (later part of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad) brought trains to Emmaus. That same year, the town was incorporated as a borough. In 1869, the town's first blast furnace opened. The largest iron company was Donaldson Iron Company, which made cast iron pipes and other products until the company closed in 1943. During the 19th century, Emmaus was also a center of silk and cigar manufacturing. Population trends In 1940, public census statistics showed that 6,731 people lived in Emmaus. The population of the borough has since nearly doubled to 11,313, as of the 2000 census. Housing construction has reached the borough line in all directions, so significant continued population growth in the borough is unlikely. Outside the borough line, however, the local population continues to grow, particularly in neighboring Lower Macungie Township. Consequently, the growth is found within the Emmaus ZIP code but not its borough limits. Historic sites Emmaus is home to several residences and other properties that were constructed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and have been labeled historic sites by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under historical preservation Commonwealth laws, the sites are protected from commercial and other development expansion in the borough. Departments=Emmaus Fire Department Until the 1980s, fire protection was provided through three fire companies. In 1980, the Borough completed the construction of the Central Fire Station on Sixth Street from which all personnel and equipment are currently dispatched. The staff consists of paid on-call volunteers who respond, on average, to 375-400 calls per year. Calls include fire protection, rescue/extrication, and HAZMAT response, and are dispatched via Lehigh County's 911 Communications Center. Its vehicles include two 1988 Central States 1250 GPM Pumpers, One 110' Simon LTI 1989 Aerial, Central States 2002 Heavy Rescue Unit, 1989 Chevrolet Fire Police Vehicle, 1985 Chevrolet and a 1983 Ford Special response units, 1969 Ford bucket utility truck, 2001 GMC Yukon (Fire Chief's vehicle), and a 2011 HME 109' aerial ladder truck. Emmaus Police Department During the late 1800s the Borough of Emmaus provided protection for the community by appointing \\"High Constables.\\" The Emmaus Police Department was established in 1909, and Wilson Kratzer was appointed as the borough's first Police Chief. Since then, the Emmaus Police Department has grown to be a Pennsylvania-accredited law enforcement agency. Emmaus Ambulance Corps Emmaus Ambulance Corps provides ambulance coverage for the borough of Emmaus, the eastern portion of Upper Milford Township, and a portion of Western Salisbury Township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.

Citizens had been especially concerned that if the borough chose to follow the consultant's advice to \\"monetize the system,\\" that the system would be sold to a multinational corporation, as was an increasing trend throughout the region. Many Emmaus residents organized themselves under the group EFLOW (\\"Emmaus for Locally Owned Water\\"), and through a combination of letter-writing, petitioning and public comment at council meetings, in early September 2005 the council voted to take water privatization off the table of options. This controversy garnered regional and national attention, with anti-privatization non-profits such as Public Citizen noting the debate and outcome. \\"Victory in Emmaus,\\" Public Citizen Transportation Emmaus is accessible by two Lehigh County highways, Cedar Crest Boulevard, located on the borough's west-side, and Lehigh Street, which is located on the borough's east-side and connects Emmaus with Allentown and Bethlehem.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by King George III on October 7, 1763, following Great Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America after the end of the Seven Years' War. It forbade all settlement west of a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains, which was delineated as an Indian Reserve. Exclusion from the vast region of Trans- Appalachia created discontent between Britain and colonial land speculators and potential settlers. The proclamation and access to western lands was one of the first significant areas of dispute between Britain and the colonies and would become a contributing factor leading to the American Revolution. The Royal Proclamation continues to be of legal importance to First Nations in Canada. The 1763 proclamation line is similar to the Eastern Continental Divide's path running northwards from Georgia to the Pennsylvania‚ÄìNew York border and north-eastwards past the drainage divide on the St. Lawrence Divide from there northwards through New England. Background: Treaty of Paris The French and Indian War and its European theater, the Seven Years' War, ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Under the treaty, all French colonial territory west of the Mississippi River was ceded to Spain, while all French colonial territory east of the Mississippi River and south of Rupert's Land (save Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which France kept) was ceded to Great Britain. Both Spain and Britain received some French islands in the Caribbean, while France kept Haiti and Guadeloupe. Provisions=New colonies The Eastern (orange line) in the southern areas, and St. Lawrence (magenta line) watershed boundaries in the northern areas of this map more-or-less defined almost all of the Royal Proclamation's western boundaries The Proclamation of 1763 dealt with the management of former French territories in North America that Britain acquired following its victory over France in the French and Indian War, as well as regulating colonial settlers' expansion. It established new governments for several areas: the province of Quebec, the new colonies of West Florida and East Florida, and a group of Caribbean islands, Grenada, Tobago, Saint Vincent, and Dominica, collectively referred to as the British Ceded Islands. Proclamation line New borders drawn by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 At the outset, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 defined the jurisdictional limits of the British territories of North America, limiting British colonial expansion on the continent. What remained of the Royal Province of New France east of the Great Lakes and the Ottawa River, and south of Rupert's Land, was reorganised under the name \\"Quebec.\\" But the territory northeast of the St. John River on the Labrador coast was reassigned to the Newfoundland Colony. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny Mountains became (British) Indian Territory, barred to settlement from colonies east of the line. The proclamation line was not intended to be a permanent boundary between the colonists and Native American lands, but rather a temporary boundary that could be extended further west in an orderly, lawful manner. It was also not designed as an uncrossable boundary; people could cross the line, but not settle past it. Its contour was defined by the headwaters that formed the watershed along the Appalachians. All land with rivers that flowed into the Atlantic was designated for the colonial entities, while all the land with rivers that flowed into the Mississippi was reserved for the Native American populations. The proclamation outlawed the private purchase of Native American land, which had often created problems in the past. Instead, all future land purchases were to be made by Crown officials \\"at some public Meeting or Assembly of the said Indians\\". British colonials were forbidden to settle on native lands, and colonial officials were forbidden to grant ground or lands without royal approval. Organized land companies asked for land grants, but were denied by King George III. The Boundary Line Map of 1768 moved the boundary west British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary since the British government had already assigned land grants to them. Including the wealthy owners of the Ohio company who protested the line to the governor of Virginia, as they had plans for settling the land to grow business. Many settlements already existed beyond the proclamation line, some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac's War, and there were many already granted land claims yet to be settled. For example, George Washington and his Virginia soldiers had been granted lands past the boundary. Prominent American colonials joined with the land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west.For information about Pontiac's War, see The colonists' demands were met and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Native Americans. The first two of these treaties were completed in 1768; the Treaty of Fort Stanwix adjusted the border with the Iroquois Confederacy in the Ohio Country and the Treaty of Hard Labour adjusted the border with the Cherokee in the Carolinas. The Treaty of Hard Labour was followed by the Treaty of Lochaber in 1770, adjusting the border between Virginia and the Cherokee. These agreements opened much of what is now Kentucky and West Virginia to British settlement. Although the land granted by the Virginian and North Carolinian government heavily favored the land companies, seeing as they had more wealthy backers than the poorer settlers who wanted to settle west to hopefully gain a fortune. Response Many colonists disregarded the proclamation line and settled west which created tension between them and the Native Americans. Pontiac's Rebellion (1763‚Äì1766) was a war involving Native American tribes, primarily from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country, and Ohio Country who were dissatisfied with British postwar policies in the Great Lakes region after the end of the Seven Years' War. They were able to take over a large number of the forts which commanded the waterways involved in trade within the region and export to Great Britain. The Proclamation of 1763 had been in the works before Pontiac's Rebellion, but the outbreak of the conflict hastened the process. Legacy=Indigenous peoples  The Royal Proclamation continued to govern the cession of Indigenous land in British North America, especially Upper Canada and Rupert's Land. Upper Canada created a platform for treaty making based on the Royal Proclamation. After loyalists moved into land after Britain's defeat in the American Revolution, the first impetus was created out of necessity. According to historian Colin Calloway, \\"[settler] scholars disagree on whether the proclamation recognized or undermined tribal sovereignty\\". Some see the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as a \\"fundamental document\\" for First Nations land claims and self-government. It is \\"the first legal recognition by the British Crown of Aboriginal rights\\" and imposes a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown. The intent and promises made to the native in the Proclamation have been argued to be of a temporary nature, only meant to appease the Native peoples who were becoming increasingly resentful of \\"settler encroachments on their lands\\" and were capable of becoming a serious threat to British colonial settlement. Advice given by a Sir William Johnson, superintendent of Indian Affairs in North America, to the Board of Trade on August 30, 1764, expressed that: Canadian jurist John Borrows has written that \\"the Proclamation illustrates the British government's attempt to exercise sovereignty over First Nations while simultaneously trying to convince First Nations that they would remain separate from European settlers and have their jurisdiction preserved.\\" Borrows further writes that the Royal Proclamation along with the subsequent Treaty of Niagara, provide for an argument that \\"discredits the claims of the Crown to exercise sovereignty over First Nations\\" and affirms Aboriginal \\"powers of self-determination in, among other things, allocating lands\\". 250th anniversary celebrations In October 2013 the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation was celebrated in Ottawa with a meeting of Indigenous leaders and Governor-General David Johnston. The Aboriginal movement Idle No More held birthday parties for this monumental document at various locations across Canada. United States USA Proclamation of 1763 Silver Medal: Franklin Mint Issue 1970 The influence of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on the coming of the American Revolution has been variously interpreted. Many historians argue that the proclamation ceased to be a major source of tension after 1768 since the aforementioned later treaties opened up extensive lands for settlement. Others have argued that colonial resentment of the proclamation contributed to the growing divide between the colonies and the mother country. Some historians argue that even though the boundary was pushed west in subsequent treaties, the British government refused to permit new colonial settlements for fear of instigating a war with Native Americans, which angered colonial land speculators. Others argue that the Royal Proclamation imposed a fiduciary duty of care on the Crown. George Washington was given of wild land in the Ohio region for his services in the French and Indian War. In 1770, Washington took the lead in securing the rights of him and his old soldiers in the French War, advancing money to pay expenses on behalf of the common cause and using his influence in the proper quarters. In August 1770, it was decided that Washington should personally make a trip to the western region, where he located tracts for himself and military comrades and eventually was granted letters patent for tracts of land there. The lands involved were open to Virginians under terms of the Treaty of Lochaber of 1770, except for the lands located south of Fort Pitt, now known as Pittsburgh. In the United States, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ended with the American Revolutionary War because Great Britain ceded the land in question to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Afterward, the U.S. government also faced difficulties in preventing frontier violence and eventually adopted policies similar to those of the Royal Proclamation. The first in a series of Indian Intercourse Acts was passed in 1790, prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands. In 1823, the U.S. Supreme Court case Johnson v. M'Intosh established that only the U.S. government, and not private individuals, could purchase land from Native Americans.

Its villages include Brookdale, East Texas, Minesite, New Hensingersville (also in Berks County), Weilersville, and Wescosville. Lower Macungie Township's growth has been attributed to its proximity to major employment centers, and strategic access to major transportation corridors. At , the township is one of the largest municipalities in the Lehigh Valley. History Before European settlement, the area that now includes Lower Macungie Township was inhabited by the Lenni Lenape people. They hunted here, and are known to have had a few small seasonal villages and jasper workshops close to streams and springs. Jasper from their quarries outside present-day Macungie and Vera Cruz was traded far and wide across North America. The name \\"Macungie\\" is derived from a Native American word meaning \\"bear swamp\\", or \\"place where bears feed\\". The early Pennsylvania German settlers took land that had been hunting grounds for the Lenni Lenape, adopting the Lenape name for the area. They cleared the scrub and forests, planted crops, raised livestock, and continually expanded their holdings. Most of what they produced fed their families and their hired and indentured servants, but some crops were grown for their cash value. Eventually they raised enough money to buy land warrants in Philadelphia from the proprietors, William Penn's heirs.

Macungie is included in the Allentown- Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the New York City-Newark, New Jersey, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. History Macungie was founded as Millerstown in 1776 by Peter Miller. On November 15, 1857, the village of Millerstown was incorporated as a borough. During Fries's Rebellion in 1800, the U.S. Marshal began arresting people for tax resistance, and arrests were made without much incident until the marshal reached Millerstown, where a crowd formed to protect a man from arrest. Failing to make that arrest, the marshal arrested a few others and returned to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania with his prisoners. Two separate groups of rebels independently vowed to liberate the prisoners and marched on Bethlehem. The militia prevailed, and John Fries, leader of the rebellion, and others were arrested. In 1875, the borough was renamed Macungie to avoid confusion with another town by the same name: Millerstown in Perry County, Pennsylvania. Macungie lies in the eastern part of the historic Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Macungie is derived from \\"Maguntsche\\", a place name used as early as 1730 to describe the region that is now Macungie and Emmaus, Pennsylvania. \\"Maguntsche\\" is a Lenape word, meaning either \\"bear swamp\\" or \\"feeding place of the bears\\". The borough's current seal depicts a bear coming to drink at water near some cattails. Other names (and alternate spellings) for Macungie have included Kunshi, Kunski, Maccongy, Machk-unschi, Machts, Machts Kunski, Macongy, Macungy, Macunjy, and Mauck-Kuntshy.

In 1737, Nicholas Kern was the first white settler in what would become Slatington. The Lenni-Lenape Native Americans were already living along \\"Warriors Path,\\" which would become Route 873. Kern established a sawmill shortly after arriving. In 1756, Benjamin Franklin reported to Governor Morris that he had procured boards and timber from Kern's sawmill. In the 19th century two Welshmen, who recognized its properties and importance from being used in Europe, discovered slate. A quarry was set up in 1845, and, in 1847, a factory was erected. In 1864, Slatington was incorporated into a Borough of Pennsylvania; its first Mayor was Robert McDowell. Historically, structural iron, knit goods, and silk were manufactured in Slatington, and there were abundant slate quarries in the area. In 1900, 3,773 people lived in Slatington, and, by 1910, that number had grown to 4,454. Between 1910 and the 2010 census, the population reduced slightly, to 4,232. The U.S. postal code (ZIP code) for Slatington, PA is 18080. Slatington was settled in 1738 and incorporated in 1864. The Fireman's Drinking Fountain and Slatington Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Education The borough is served by the Northern Lehigh School District.

It is a suburb of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley area of the state. The population of South Whitehall Township was 19,180 at the 2010 census. It is home to the Lehigh Valley interchange of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Dorney Park, as well it has the distinction of having the second highest tax rate of any township in Lehigh County.  History  The first settlers of the Lehigh Valley region were Germans who emigrated from earlier settlements along the Perkiomen Creek. The earliest settlers arrived in the region over a 20-year period beginning in about 1732. The immigration of the Germans and other European natives, including Swiss and Huguenots, was aided by William Penn and his friends. The land lying south of the South Mountain was given to William Penn in 1713 by the Lenni Lenape Indians. The land of Lehigh County lying between the Blue Mountain and the Lehigh Mountains was given to Penn's sons by the Lenni Lenapes in 1732. Emigrants sought the fertile, limestone valley flanking rivers and streams such as the Jordan Creek. One of the earliest tracts of land purchased in the Township was by Nicholas Kern who bought tracts of land on December 3, 1735 and October 28, 1737. Some of this was sold to Lorenz Guth on February 27, 1739. Guth continued to buy land in the area of the Reformed church property and also in the Guthsville area. By 1769 his holdings totaled . The Lorenz Guth house near Wehr's Dam still stands in excellent condition and is a fine example of colonial architecture. Much of the history of South Whitehall can be traced to the Walbert-Guthsville region, and especially the two Jordan churches. The first ministration to the Lutheran people in the township occurred in 1734 when Reverend John Casper Stoever baptized Margaret, the daughter of the John Lichtenwalners, on February 6. In 1736 a Reverend Schmidt preached occasionally to the Lutherans, and in 1739 Reverend John Justus Jacob Birkenstock became pastor of the Jordan Lutheran congregation. In 1845 it was noted that the centennial of the congregation was observed, which would indicate that the first building was erected in 1745. The first church building was of logs and stood near the north wall of the old burial ground. It was used jointly by the Lutheran and Reformed congregations until about 1752 when the Reformed erected a building half a mile to the east, within sight of the current municipal building. The Lutherans built the present church in 1842‚Äì1843 at a cost of $3,581.24 (). It was renovated in 1868, and in 1886 a fine, shapely, slate-covered steeple, high, was erected. Members of the Reformed (United Church of Christ) religion settled in the area as early as 1738, and baptisms of their children during the period of 1740 to 1752 are recorded in the Lutheran record book. In 1752 Lorenz Guth presented the Reformed with a tract of land, and a log church was erected in six weeks. The second and present church building, with its steeple was built in 1808. It stands as one of the oldest church buildings in the country, and is a fine example of the architecture of that period. The early schools of the township were connected with the two Jordan churches for many years, possibly extending back to 1739. According to the Roberts history, the congregations were at first supplied not by pastors, but by teachers who used to read sermons on Sundays. Thus, it is possible that church-sponsored schools taught by the readers existed in the earliest days of the congregations. The original name \\"Whitehall\\" dates to 1740 and encompasses the land now found in North Whitehall, South Whitehall, and Whitehall Townships. Prior to the establishment of Northampton County in 1752, the area was part of Bucks County and the land currently occupied by South Whitehall was known as \\"the back part of Macungie\\" on the \\"Heidelberg District.\\" The name Whitehall is thought to be derived from one of two sources: either a place in England, or for a white house erected as a hunting lodge near the Jordan and Cedar Creeks. South Whitehall Township was established in 1810 by a petition to the Northampton County Court to divide former Whitehall Township into two areas, North Whitehall and South Whitehall Townships. In 1812, Lehigh County was divided off from the original Northampton County, establishing South Whitehall Township within and nearly at the center of Lehigh County. At that time, according to historians, \\"...many prominent and influential men who lived in the vicinity of Guthsville exerted themselves to secure the selection of the village as the place best adapted for the county seat on account of its situation in the geographical center of the large area of territory to be erected into a separate county, but their efforts proved unavailing and the advocates of Allentown were successful.\\" (The quotations from Roberts History published in 1914.) Agriculture was the backbone of the economy of the township for many years. Much of the land today still is under cultivation. For more than a century at least six grain mills flourished on the Jordan and Cedar Creeks. In the early 19th century iron ore was discovered at different places in the township and mining operations were carried on from 1820 to 1890. In 1867, the eastern portion of South Whitehall and the southeastern portion of North Whitehall were detached and formed into Whitehall Township. In 1966, South Whitehall became a First Class Township. Main entrance to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, in South Whitehall Township, 1950.

Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. The total entropy of a system and its surroundings can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, or is undergoing a (fictive) reversible process. In all processes that occur, including spontaneous processes,Atkins and de Paula, p.78 the total entropy of the system and its surroundings increases and the process is irreversible in the thermodynamic sense. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past. Historically, the second law was an empirical finding that was accepted as an axiom of thermodynamic theory. Statistical mechanics, classical or quantum, explains the microscopic origin of the law. The second law has been expressed in many ways. Its first formulation is credited to the French scientist Sadi Carnot, who in 1824 showed that there is an upper limit to the efficiency of conversion of heat to work in a heat engine. This aspect of the second law is often named after Carnot.Jaffe, R.L., Taylor, W. (2018). The Physics of Energy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, pages 150, 151, 259, 772, 743. Introduction Heat flow from hot water to cold water. The first law of thermodynamics provides the definition of the internal energy of a thermodynamic system, and expresses the law of conservation of energy.Planck, M. (1897/1903), pp. 40‚Äì41.Munster A. (1970), pp. 8‚Äì9, 50‚Äì51. The second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes. It asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense, and is not reversible. For example, when a path for conduction and radiation is made available, heat always flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body. Such phenomena are accounted for in terms of entropy.Planck, M. (1897/1903), pp. 79‚Äì107.Bailyn, M. (1994), Section 71, pp. 113‚Äì154. If an isolated system is held initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning impermeable walls, and then some operation makes the walls more permeable, then the system spontaneously evolves to reach a final new internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and its total entropy, , increases. In a fictive reversible process, an infinitesimal increment in the entropy () of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat () to a closed system (which allows the entry or exit of energy ‚Äì but not transfer of matter) divided by the common temperature () of the system in equilibrium and the surroundings which supply the heat:Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 120. : \\\\mathrm dS = \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} \\\\,\\\\, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\text {(closed system, idealized fictive reversible process)}. Different notations are used for infinitesimal amounts of heat () and infinitesimal amounts of entropy () because entropy is a function of state, while heat, like work, is not. For an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of mass with the surroundings, the second law requires that the increment in system entropy fulfills the inequality Mortimer, R. G. Physical Chemistry. 3rd ed., p. 120, Academic Press, 2008. Fermi, E.

This statement introduces the impossibility of the reversion of evolution of the thermodynamic system in time and can be considered as a formulation of the second principle of thermodynamics ‚Äì the formulation, which is, of course, equivalent to the formulation of the principle in terms of entropy. Pokrovskii V.N. (2005) Extended thermodynamics in a discrete-system approach, Eur. J. Phys. vol. 26, 769‚Äì781. The zeroth law of thermodynamics in its usual short statement allows recognition that two bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature, especially that a test body has the same temperature as a reference thermometric body. For a body in thermal equilibrium with another, there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales, in general respectively depending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric body. The second law allows a distinguished temperature scale, which defines an absolute, thermodynamic temperature, independent of the properties of any particular reference thermometric body.Zemansky, M.W. (1968), pp. 207‚Äì209.Quinn, T.J. (1983), p. 8. Various statements of the law The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways, the most prominent classical statements being the statement by Rudolf Clausius (1854), the statement by Lord Kelvin (1851), and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by Constantin Carath√©odory (1909). These statements cast the law in general physical terms citing the impossibility of certain processes. The Clausius and the Kelvin statements have been shown to be equivalent. Carnot's principle The historical originCarnot, S. (1824/1986). of the second law of thermodynamics was in Carnot's principle. It refers to a cycle of a Carnot heat engine, fictively operated in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static, so that the heat and work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Carnot engine is an idealized device of special interest to engineers who are concerned with the efficiency of heat engines. Carnot's principle was recognized by Carnot at a time when the caloric theory of heat was seriously considered, before the recognition of the first law of thermodynamics, and before the mathematical expression of the concept of entropy. Interpreted in the light of the first law, it is physically equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics, and remains valid today. Carnot's original arguments were made from the viewpoint of the caloric theory, before the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics. Some samples from his book are: ::...wherever there exists a difference of temperature, motive power can be produced.Carnot, S. (1824/1986), p. 51. ::The production of motive power is then due in steam engines not to an actual consumption of caloric, but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body ...Carnot, S. (1824/1986), p. 46. ::The motive power of heat is independent of the agents employed to realize it; its quantity is fixed solely by the temperatures of the bodies between which is effected, finally, the transfer of caloric.Carnot, S. (1824/1986), p. 68. In modern terms, Carnot's principle may be stated more precisely: ::The efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible Carnot cycle depends only on the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs, and is the same, whatever the working substance. A Carnot engine operated in this way is the most efficient possible heat engine using those two temperatures.Truesdell, C. (1980), Chapter 5.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 56‚Äì58.M√ºnster, A. (1970), p. 11.Kondepudi, D., Prigogine, I. (1998), pp.67‚Äì75.Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas- V√°zquez, J. (2008), p. 10.Eu, B.C. (2002), pp. 32‚Äì35. Clausius statement The German scientist Rudolf Clausius laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in 1850 by examining the relation between heat transfer and work. His formulation of the second law, which was published in German in 1854, is known as the Clausius statement: > Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other > change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time. The statement by Clausius uses the concept of 'passage of heat'. As is usual in thermodynamic discussions, this means 'net transfer of energy as heat', and does not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other. Heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without external work being performed on the system, which is evident from ordinary experience of refrigeration, for example. In a refrigerator, heat flows from cold to hot, but only when forced by an external agent, the refrigeration system. Kelvin statements Lord Kelvin expressed the second law in several wordings. ::It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency, to convey heat from one body to another at a higher temperature. ::It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects. Equivalence of the Clausius and the Kelvin statements Derive Kelvin Statement from Clausius Statement Suppose there is an engine violating the Kelvin statement: i.e., one that drains heat and converts it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without any other result. Now pair it with a reversed Carnot engine as shown by the figure. The efficiency of a normal heat engine is Œ∑ and so the efficiency of the reversed heat engine is 1/Œ∑. The net and sole effect of the combined pair of engines is to transfer heat \\\\Delta Q=Q\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta}-1\\\\right) from the cooler reservoir to the hotter one, which violates the Clausius statement. (This is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, as for the total system's energy to remain the same, \\\\text{Input}+\\\\text{Output}=0 \\\\implies Q-\\\\frac{Q}{\\\\eta} = -Q_c , so therefore Q_c=Q\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta}-1\\\\right) ). Thus a violation of the Kelvin statement implies a violation of the Clausius statement, i.e. the Clausius statement implies the Kelvin statement. We can prove in a similar manner that the Kelvin statement implies the Clausius statement, and hence the two are equivalent. Planck's proposition Planck offered the following proposition as derived directly from experience. This is sometimes regarded as his statement of the second law, but he regarded it as a starting point for the derivation of the second law. ::It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and cooling of a heat reservoir.Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 86.Roberts, J.K., Miller, A.R. (1928/1960), p. 319. Relation between Kelvin's statement and Planck's proposition It is almost customary in textbooks to speak of the \\"Kelvin- Planck statement\\" of the law, as for example in the text by ter Haar and Wergeland.ter Haar, D., Wergeland, H. (1966), p. 17. The Kelvin‚ÄìPlanck statement (or the heat engine statement) of the second law of thermodynamics states that ::It is impossible to devise a cyclically operating device, the sole effect of which is to absorb energy in the form of heat from a single thermal reservoir and to deliver an equivalent amount of work. Planck's statement Planck stated the second law as follows. ::Every process occurring in nature proceeds in the sense in which the sum of the entropies of all bodies taking part in the process is increased. In the limit, i.e. for reversible processes, the sum of the entropies remains unchanged.Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 100.Planck, M. (1926), p. 463, translation by Uffink, J. (2003), p. 131.Roberts, J.K., Miller, A.R. (1928/1960), p. 382. This source is partly verbatim from Planck's statement, but does not cite Planck. This source calls the statement the principle of the increase of entropy. Rather like Planck's statement is that of Uhlenbeck and Ford for irreversible phenomena. ::... in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium state to another (as for example the equalization of temperature of two bodies A and B, when brought in contact) the entropy always increases.Uhlenbeck, G.E., Ford, G.W. (1963), p. 16. Principle of Carath√©odory Constantin Carath√©odory formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic foundation. His statement of the second law is known as the Principle of Carath√©odory, which may be formulated as follows:Carath√©odory, C. (1909). > In every neighborhood of any state S of an adiabatically enclosed system > there are states inaccessible from S.Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 68. With this formulation, he described the concept of adiabatic accessibility for the first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical thermodynamics, often called geometrical thermodynamics. It follows from Carath√©odory's principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically transferred as heat is a holonomic process function, in other words, \\\\delta Q=TdS. Though it is almost customary in textbooks to say that Carath√©odory's principle expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the Clausius or to the Kelvin-Planck statements, such is not the case. To get all the content of the second law, Carath√©odory's principle needs to be supplemented by Planck's principle, that isochoric work always increases the internal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium.M√ºnster, A. (1970), p. 45.Planck, M. (1926).Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 69. Planck's principle In 1926, Max Planck wrote an important paper on the basics of thermodynamics.Uffink, J. (2003), pp. 129‚Äì132. He indicated the principle ::The internal energy of a closed system is increased by an adiabatic process, throughout the duration of which, the volume of the system remains constant. This formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature, nor even entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but it implies the content of the second law. A closely related statement is that \\"Frictional pressure never does positive work.\\"Truesdell, C., Muncaster, R.G. (1980). Fundamentals of Maxwell's Kinetic Theory of a Simple Monatomic Gas, Treated as a Branch of Rational Mechanics, Academic Press, New York, , p. 15. Planck wrote: \\"The production of heat by friction is irreversible.\\"Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 81.Planck, M. (1926), p. 457, Wikipedia editor's translation. Not mentioning entropy, this principle of Planck is stated in physical terms. It is very closely related to the Kelvin statement given just above.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (2003), p. 149. It is relevant that for a system at constant volume and mole numbers, the entropy is a monotonic function of the internal energy. Nevertheless, this principle of Planck is not actually Planck's preferred statement of the second law, which is quoted above, in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present article, and relies on the concept of entropy. A statement that in a sense is complementary to Planck's principle is made by Borgnakke and Sonntag. They do not offer it as a full statement of the second law: ::... there is only one way in which the entropy of a [closed] system can be decreased, and that is to transfer heat from the system.Borgnakke, C., Sonntag., R.E. (2009), p. 304. Differing from Planck's just foregoing principle, this one is explicitly in terms of entropy change. Removal of matter from a system can also decrease its entropy. Statement for a system that has a known expression of its internal energy as a function of its extensive state variables The second law has been shown to be equivalent to the internal energy U being a weakly convex function, when written as a function of extensive properties (mass, volume, entropy, ...). Corollaries=Perpetual motion of the second kind Before the establishment of the second law, many people who were interested in inventing a perpetual motion machine had tried to circumvent the restrictions of first law of thermodynamics by extracting the massive internal energy of the environment as the power of the machine. Such a machine is called a \\"perpetual motion machine of the second kind\\". The second law declared the impossibility of such machines. Carnot theorem Carnot's theorem (1824) is a principle that limits the maximum efficiency for any possible engine. The efficiency solely depends on the temperature difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoirs. Carnot's theorem states: *All irreversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs. *All reversible heat engines between two heat reservoirs are equally efficient with a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs. In his ideal model, the heat of caloric converted into work could be reinstated by reversing the motion of the cycle, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. Carnot, however, further postulated that some caloric is lost, not being converted to mechanical work. Hence, no real heat engine could realise the Carnot cycle's reversibility and was condemned to be less efficient. Though formulated in terms of caloric (see the obsolete caloric theory), rather than entropy, this was an early insight into the second law. Clausius inequality The Clausius theorem (1854) states that in a cyclic process : \\\\oint \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} \\\\leq 0. The equality holds in the reversible caseClausius theorem at Wolfram Research and the strict inequality holds in the irreversible case. The reversible case is used to introduce the state function entropy. This is because in cyclic processes the variation of a state function is zero from state functionality. Thermodynamic temperature For an arbitrary heat engine, the efficiency is: : \\\\eta = \\\\frac {W_n}{q_H} = \\\\frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} \\\\qquad (1) where Wn is for the net work done per cycle. Thus the efficiency depends only on qC/qH. Carnot's theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T2 must have the same efficiency, that is to say, the efficiency is the function of temperatures only: \\\\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)\\\\qquad (2). In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T1 and another (intermediate) temperature T2, and the second between T2 andT3. This can only be the case if : f(T_1,T_3) = \\\\frac{q_3}{q_1} = \\\\frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3). Now consider the case where T_1 is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any T2 and T3, : f(T_2,T_3) = \\\\frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \\\\frac{273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T_2)}. Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by : T = 273.16 \\\\cdot f(T_1,T) \\\\, then the function f, viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is simply : f(T_2,T_3) = \\\\frac{T_3}{T_2}, and the reference temperature T1 will have the value 273.16. (Any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be usedthe choice here corresponds to the Kelvin scale.) Entropy According to the Clausius equality, for a reversible process : \\\\oint \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T}=0 That means the line integral \\\\int_L \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} is path independent for reversible processes. So we can define a state function S called entropy, which for a reversible process or for pure heat transfer satisfies : dS = \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} ! With this we can only obtain the difference of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value, we need the third law of thermodynamics, which states that S = 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals. For any irreversible process, since entropy is a state function, we can always connect the initial and terminal states with an imaginary reversible process and integrating on that path to calculate the difference in entropy. Now reverse the reversible process and combine it with the said irreversible process. Applying the Clausius inequality on this loop, : -\\\\Delta S+\\\\int\\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T}=\\\\oint\\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T}< 0 Thus, : \\\\Delta S \\\\ge \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} \\\\,! where the equality holds if the transformation is reversible. Notice that if the process is an adiabatic process, then \\\\delta Q=0, so \\\\Delta S\\\\ge 0. Energy, available useful work An important and revealing idealized special case is to consider applying the Second Law to the scenario of an isolated system (called the total system or universe), made up of two parts: a sub-system of interest, and the sub-system's surroundings. These surroundings are imagined to be so large that they can be considered as an unlimited heat reservoir at temperature TR and pressure PR so that no matter how much heat is transferred to (or from) the sub-system, the temperature of the surroundings will remain TR; and no matter how much the volume of the sub-system expands (or contracts), the pressure of the surroundings will remain PR. Whatever changes to dS and dSR occur in the entropies of the sub-system and the surroundings individually, according to the Second Law the entropy Stot of the isolated total system must not decrease: : dS_{\\\\mathrm{tot}}= dS + dS_R \\\\ge 0 According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change dU in the internal energy of the sub-system is the sum of the heat Œ¥q added to the sub-system, less any work Œ¥w done by the sub-system, plus any net chemical energy entering the sub-system d ‚àëŒºiRNi, so that: : dU = \\\\delta q - \\\\delta w + d(\\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR}N_i) \\\\, where ŒºiR are the chemical potentials of chemical species in the external surroundings. Now the heat leaving the reservoir and entering the sub-system is : \\\\delta q = T_R (-dS_R) \\\\le T_R dS where we have first used the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics (alternatively, in statistical thermodynamics, the relation between entropy change, temperature and absorbed heat can be derived); and then the Second Law inequality from above. It therefore follows that any net work Œ¥w done by the sub-system must obey : \\\\delta w \\\\le - dU + T_R dS + \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} dN_i \\\\, It is useful to separate the work Œ¥w done by the subsystem into the useful work Œ¥wu that can be done by the sub-system, over and beyond the work pR dV done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external pressure, giving the following relation for the useful work (exergy) that can be done: : \\\\delta w_u \\\\le -d (U - T_R S + p_R V - \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} N_i )\\\\, It is convenient to define the right-hand-side as the exact derivative of a thermodynamic potential, called the availability or exergy E of the subsystem, : E = U - T_R S + p_R V - \\\\sum \\\\mu_{iR} N_i The Second Law therefore implies that for any process which can be considered as divided simply into a subsystem, and an unlimited temperature and pressure reservoir with which it is in contact, : dE + \\\\delta w_u \\\\le 0 \\\\, i.e. the change in the subsystem's exergy plus the useful work done by the subsystem (or, the change in the subsystem's exergy less any work, additional to that done by the pressure reservoir, done on the system) must be less than or equal to zero. In sum, if a proper infinite-reservoir-like reference state is chosen as the system surroundings in the real world, then the Second Law predicts a decrease in E for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process. : dS_{tot} \\\\ge 0 Is equivalent to dE + \\\\delta w_u \\\\le 0 This expression together with the associated reference state permits a design engineer working at the macroscopic scale (above the thermodynamic limit) to utilize the Second Law without directly measuring or considering entropy change in a total isolated system. (Also, see process engineer). Those changes have already been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration can reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference state. An efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it to the reversible ideal may also be found (See second law efficiency.) This approach to the Second Law is widely utilized in engineering practice, environmental accounting, systems ecology, and other disciplines. The second law in chemical thermodynamics For a spontaneous chemical process in a closed system at constant temperature and pressure without non-PV work, the Clausius inequality ŒîS > Q/Tsurr transforms into a condition for the change in Gibbs free energy : \\\\Delta G < 0 or dG < 0\\\\. For a similar process at constant temperature and volume, the change in Helmholtz free energy must be negative, \\\\Delta A < 0 . Thus, a negative value of the change in free energy (G or A) is a necessary condition for a process to be spontaneous. This is the most useful form of the second law of thermodynamics in chemistry, where free-energy changes can be calculated from tabulated enthalpies of formation and standard molar entropies of reactants and products. The chemical equilibrium condition at constant T and p without electrical work is dG = 0. History Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot in the traditional uniform of a student of the √âcole Polytechnique. The first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot in 1824. He was the first to realize correctly that the efficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature between an engine and its environment. Recognizing the significance of James Prescott Joule's work on the conservation of energy, Rudolf Clausius was the first to formulate the second law during 1850, in this form: heat does not flow spontaneously from cold to hot bodies. While common knowledge now, this was contrary to the caloric theory of heat popular at the time, which considered heat as a fluid. From there he was able to infer the principle of Sadi Carnot and the definition of entropy (1865). Established during the 19th century, the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law says, \\"It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.\\" This was shown to be equivalent to the statement of Clausius. The ergodic hypothesis is also important for the Boltzmann approach. It says that, over long periods of time, the time spent in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e. that all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long period of time. Equivalently, it says that time average and average over the statistical ensemble are the same. There is a traditional doctrine, starting with Clausius, that entropy can be understood in terms of molecular 'disorder' within a macroscopic system. This doctrine is obsolescent.Denbigh, K.G., Denbigh, J.S. (1985). Entropy in Relation to Incomplete Knowledge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, , pp. 43‚Äì44.Grandy, W.T., Jr (2008). Entropy and the Time Evolution of Macroscopic Systems, Oxford University Press, Oxford, , pp. 55‚Äì58.Entropy Sites ‚Äî A Guide Content selected by Frank L. Lambert Account given by Clausius Rudolf Clausius In 1856, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius stated what he called the \\"second fundamental theorem in the mechanical theory of heat\\" in the following form: : \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} = -N where Q is heat, T is temperature and N is the \\"equivalence-value\\" of all uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process. Later, in 1865, Clausius would come to define \\"equivalence- value\\" as entropy. On the heels of this definition, that same year, the most famous version of the second law was read in a presentation at the Philosophical Society of Zurich on April 24, in which, in the end of his presentation, Clausius concludes: > The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum. This statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law. Because of the looseness of its language, e.g. universe, as well as lack of specific conditions, e.g. open, closed, or isolated, many people take this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to every subject imaginable. This is not true; this statement is only a simplified version of a more extended and precise description. In terms of time variation, the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is: : \\\\frac{dS}{dt} \\\\ge 0 where : S is the entropy of the system and : t is time. The equality sign applies after equilibration. An alternative way of formulating of the second law for isolated systems is: : \\\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\\\dot S_{i} with \\\\dot S_{i} \\\\ge 0 with \\\\dot S_{i} the sum of the rate of entropy production by all processes inside the system. The advantage of this formulation is that it shows the effect of the entropy production. The rate of entropy production is a very important concept since it determines (limits) the efficiency of thermal machines. Multiplied with ambient temperature T_{a} it gives the so-called dissipated energy P_{diss}=T_{a}\\\\dot S_{i}. The expression of the second law for closed systems (so, allowing heat exchange and moving boundaries, but not exchange of matter) is: : \\\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\dot Q}{T}+\\\\dot S_{i} with \\\\dot S_{i} \\\\ge 0 Here : \\\\dot Q is the heat flow into the system : T is the temperature at the point where the heat enters the system. The equality sign holds in the case that only reversible processes take place inside the system. If irreversible processes take place (which is the case in real systems in operation) the >-sign holds. If heat is supplied to the system at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of the corresponding terms. For open systems (also allowing exchange of matter): : \\\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\dot Q}{T}+\\\\dot S+\\\\dot S_{i} with \\\\dot S_{i} \\\\ge 0 Here \\\\dot S is the flow of entropy into the system associated with the flow of matter entering the system. It should not be confused with the time derivative of the entropy. If matter is supplied at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of these contributions. Statistical mechanics Statistical mechanics gives an explanation for the second law by postulating that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant motion. A particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion, the system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics postulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense. That is, the second law will hold on average, with a statistical variation on the order of 1/ where N is the number of particles in the system. For everyday (macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero. However, for systems with a small number of particles, thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law. Classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations. Derivation from statistical mechanics The first mechanical argument of the Kinetic theory of gases that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium was due to James Clerk Maxwell in 1860; Ludwig Boltzmann with his H-theorem of 1872 also argued that due to collisions gases should over time tend toward the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. Due to Loschmidt's paradox, derivations of the Second Law have to make an assumption regarding the past, namely that the system is uncorrelated at some time in the past; this allows for simple probabilistic treatment. This assumption is usually thought as a boundary condition, and thus the second Law is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the past, probably at the beginning of the universe (the Big Bang), though other scenarios have also been suggested. Given these assumptions, in statistical mechanics, the Second Law is not a postulate, rather it is a consequence of the fundamental postulate, also known as the equal prior probability postulate, so long as one is clear that simple probability arguments are applied only to the future, while for the past there are auxiliary sources of information which tell us that it was low entropy. The first part of the second law, which states that the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase, is a trivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate, if we restrict the notion of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium. The entropy of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium containing an amount of energy of E is: : S = k_{\\\\mathrm B} \\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\, where \\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right) is the number of quantum states in a small interval between E and E +\\\\delta E. Here \\\\delta E is a macroscopically small energy interval that is kept fixed. Strictly speaking this means that the entropy depends on the choice of \\\\delta E. However, in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. in the limit of infinitely large system size), the specific entropy (entropy per unit volume or per unit mass) does not depend on \\\\delta E. Suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state is specified by a number of variables. These macroscopic variables can, e.g., refer to the total volume, the positions of pistons in the system, etc. Then \\\\Omega will depend on the values of these variables. If a variable is not fixed, (e.g. we do not clamp a piston in a certain position), then because all the accessible states are equally likely in equilibrium, the free variable in equilibrium will be such that \\\\Omega is maximized as that is the most probable situation in equilibrium. If the variable was initially fixed to some value then upon release and when the new equilibrium has been reached, the fact the variable will adjust itself so that \\\\Omega is maximized, implies that the entropy will have increased or it will have stayed the same (if the value at which the variable was fixed happened to be the equilibrium value). Suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a constraint on a variable. Then right after we do this, there are a number \\\\Omega of accessible microstates, but equilibrium has not yet been reached, so the actual probabilities of the system being in some accessible state are not yet equal to the prior probability of 1/\\\\Omega. We have already seen that in the final equilibrium state, the entropy will have increased or have stayed the same relative to the previous equilibrium state. Boltzmann's H-theorem, however, proves that the quantity increases monotonically as a function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state. Derivation of the entropy change for reversible processes The second part of the Second Law states that the entropy change of a system undergoing a reversible process is given by: : dS =\\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} where the temperature is defined as: :\\\\frac{1}{k_{\\\\mathrm B} T}\\\\equiv\\\\beta\\\\equiv\\\\frac{d\\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right)\\\\right]}{dE} See here for the justification for this definition. Suppose that the system has some external parameter, x, that can be changed. In general, the energy eigenstates of the system will depend on x. According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system's Hamiltonian, the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change its energy according to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it is in. The generalized force, X, corresponding to the external variable x is defined such that X dx is the work performed by the system if x is increased by an amount dx. E.g., if x is the volume, then X is the pressure. The generalized force for a system known to be in energy eigenstate E_{r} is given by: : X = -\\\\frac{dE_{r}}{dx} Since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of \\\\delta E, we define the generalized force for the system as the expectation value of the above expression: : X = -\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{dE_{r}}{dx}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\, To evaluate the average, we partition the \\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right) energy eigenstates by counting how many of them have a value for \\\\frac{dE_{r}}{dx} within a range between Y and Y + \\\\delta Y. Calling this number \\\\Omega_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right), we have: : \\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{Y}\\\\Omega_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right)\\\\, The average defining the generalized force can now be written: : X = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right)}\\\\sum_{Y} Y\\\\Omega_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right)\\\\, We can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to x at constant energy E as follows. Suppose we change x to x + dx. Then \\\\Omega\\\\left(E\\\\right) will change because the energy eigenstates depend on x, causing energy eigenstates to move into or out of the range between E and E+\\\\delta E. Let's focus again on the energy eigenstates for which \\\\frac{dE_{r}}{dx} lies within the range between Y and Y + \\\\delta Y. Since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by Y dx, all such energy eigenstates that are in the interval ranging from E ‚Äì Y dx to E move from below E to above E. There are : N_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\Omega_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right)}{\\\\delta E} Y dx\\\\, such energy eigenstates. If Y dx\\\\leq\\\\delta E, all these energy eigenstates will move into the range between E and E+\\\\delta E and contribute to an increase in \\\\Omega. The number of energy eigenstates that move from below E+\\\\delta E to above E+\\\\delta E is given by N_{Y}\\\\left(E+\\\\delta E\\\\right). The difference : N_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right) - N_{Y}\\\\left(E+\\\\delta E\\\\right)\\\\, is thus the net contribution to the increase in \\\\Omega. Note that if Y dx is larger than \\\\delta E there will be the energy eigenstates that move from below E to above E+\\\\delta E. They are counted in both N_{Y}\\\\left(E\\\\right) and N_{Y}\\\\left(E+\\\\delta E\\\\right), therefore the above expression is also valid in that case. Expressing the above expression as a derivative with respect to E and summing over Y yields the expression: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_{E} = -\\\\sum_{Y}Y\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Omega_{Y}}{\\\\partial E}\\\\right)_{x}= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\left(\\\\Omega X\\\\right)}{\\\\partial E}\\\\right)_{x}\\\\, The logarithmic derivative of \\\\Omega with respect to x is thus given by: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\Omega\\\\right)}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_{E} = \\\\beta X +\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial X}{\\\\partial E}\\\\right)_{x}\\\\, The first term is intensive, i.e. it does not scale with system size. In contrast, the last term scales as the inverse system size and will thus vanish in the thermodynamic limit. We have thus found that: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_{E} = \\\\frac{X}{T}\\\\, Combining this with : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial E}\\\\right)_{x} = \\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\, Gives: : dS = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial E}\\\\right)_{x}dE+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_{E}dx = \\\\frac{dE}{T} + \\\\frac{X}{T} dx=\\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T}\\\\, Derivation for systems described by the canonical ensemble If a system is in thermal contact with a heat bath at some temperature T then, in equilibrium, the probability distribution over the energy eigenvalues are given by the canonical ensemble: : P_{j}=\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{E_{j}}{k_{\\\\mathrm B} T}\\\\right)}{Z} Here Z is a factor that normalizes the sum of all the probabilities to 1, this function is known as the partition function. We now consider an infinitesimal reversible change in the temperature and in the external parameters on which the energy levels depend. It follows from the general formula for the entropy: : S = -k_{\\\\mathrm B}\\\\sum_{j}P_{j}\\\\ln\\\\left(P_{j}\\\\right) that : dS = -k_{\\\\mathrm B}\\\\sum_{j}\\\\ln\\\\left(P_{j}\\\\right)dP_{j} Inserting the formula for P_{j} for the canonical ensemble in here gives: : dS = \\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum_{j}E_{j}dP_{j}=\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum_{j}d\\\\left(E_{j}P_{j}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum_{j}P_{j}dE_{j}= \\\\frac{dE + \\\\delta W}{T}=\\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} Living organisms There are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics, (a) through passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, and (b) through cyclic processes, by which the system is left unchanged, while the total entropy of the surroundings is increased. These two ways help to understand the processes of life. The thermodynamics of living organisms has been considered by many authors, such as Erwin Schr√∂dinger, L√©on BrillouinL√©on Brillouin Science and Information Theory (Academic Press, 1962) (Dover, 2004) and Isaac Asimov. To a fair approximation, living organisms may be considered as examples of (b). Approximately, an animal's physical state cycles by the day, leaving the animal nearly unchanged. Animals take in food, water, and oxygen, and, as a result of metabolism, give out breakdown products and heat. Plants take in radiative energy from the sun, which may be regarded as heat, and carbon dioxide and water. They give out oxygen. In this way they grow. Eventually they die, and their remains rot away, turning mostly back into carbon dioxide and water. This can be regarded as a cyclic process. Overall, the sunlight is from a high temperature source, the sun, and its energy is passed to a lower temperature sink, i.e. radiated into space. This is an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant. Thus animals and plants obey the second law of thermodynamics, considered in terms of cyclic processes. Living organisms may be considered as open systems, because matter passes into and out from them. Thermodynamics of open systems is currently often considered in terms of passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, or in terms of flows in the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem for living organisms may be further simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady state with unchanging flows. General principles of entropy production for such approximations are subject to unsettled current debate or research. Gravitational systems Commonly, systems for which gravity is not important have a positive heat capacity, meaning that their temperature rises with their internal energy. Therefore, when energy flows from a high- temperature object to a low-temperature object, the source temperature decreases while the sink temperature is increased; hence temperature differences tend to diminish over time. This is not always the case for systems in which the gravitational force is important: systems that are bound by their own gravity, such as stars, can have negative heat capacities. As they contract, both their total energy and their entropy decrease but their their internal temperature may increase. This can be significant for protostars and even gas giant planets such as Jupiter. As gravity is the most important force operating on cosmological scales, it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to the universe as a whole.Grandy, W.T. (Jr) (2008), p. 151. Non-equilibrium states The theory of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics is idealized. A main postulate or assumption, often not even explicitly stated, is the existence of systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium. In general, a region of space containing a physical system at a given time, that may be found in nature, is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, read in the most stringent terms. In looser terms, nothing in the entire universe is or has ever been truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 15. For purposes of physical analysis, it is often enough convenient to make an assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium. Such an assumption may rely on trial and error for its justification. If the assumption is justified, it can often be very valuable and useful because it makes available the theory of thermodynamics. Elements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is observed to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time, and that there are so many particles in a system, that its particulate nature can be entirely ignored. Under such an equilibrium assumption, in general, there are no macroscopically detectable fluctuations. There is an exception, the case of critical states, which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of critical opalescence. For laboratory studies of critical states, exceptionally long observation times are needed. In all cases, the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, once made, implies as a consequence that no putative candidate \\"fluctuation\\" alters the entropy of the system. It can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic changes that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of the entropy. Or that a physical system has so few particles that the particulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations. Then the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned. There is no unqualified general definition of entropy for non- equilibrium states.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (2003), p. 190. There are intermediate cases, in which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is a very good approximation,Gyarmati, I. (1967/1970), pp. 4-14.Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971).M√ºller, I. (1985).M√ºller, I. (2003). but strictly speaking it is still an approximation, not theoretically ideal. For non- equilibrium situations in general, it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definitions of other quantities that may be conveniently called 'entropy', but they should not be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly defined for the second law. These other quantities indeed belong to statistical mechanics, not to thermodynamics, the primary realm of the second law. The physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of this article. Arrow of time The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to reversal of the time direction. This does not conflict with symmetries observed in the fundamental laws of physics (particularly CPT symmetry) since the second law applies statistically on time-asymmetric boundary conditions. The second law has been related to the difference between moving forwards and backwards in time, or to the principle that cause precedes effect (the causal arrow of time, or causality). chapter 6 Irreversibility Irreversibility in thermodynamic processes is a consequence of the asymmetric character of thermodynamic operations, and not of any internally irreversible microscopic properties of the bodies. Thermodynamic operations are macroscopic external interventions imposed on the participating bodies, not derived from their internal properties. There are reputed \\"paradoxes\\" that arise from failure to recognize this. Loschmidt's paradox Loschmidt's paradox, also known as the reversibility paradox, is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-symmetric dynamics that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system. In the opinion of Schr√∂dinger, \\"It is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropyor for that matter, all other irreversible statementsso that they be capable of being derived from reversible models. You must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two, which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world, but not always from each other.\\"Schr√∂dinger, E. (1950), p. 192. The two systems are isolated from each other by the wall, until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation, as envisaged by the law. The thermodynamic operation is externally imposed, not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems. It is the cause of the irreversibility. The statement of the law in this present article complies with Schr√∂dinger's advice. The cause‚Äìeffect relation is logically prior to the second law, not derived from it. Poincar√© recurrence theorem The Poincar√© recurrence theorem considers a theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system. This may be considered as a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal wall. The system will, after a sufficiently long time, return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one. The Poincar√© recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return. It is exceedingly long, likely longer than the life of the universe, and depends sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. The recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. More obviously, however, it is simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by removal of a wall between two systems. For a typical thermodynamical system, the recurrence time is so large (many many times longer than the lifetime of the universe) that, for all practical purposes, one cannot observe the recurrence. One might wish, nevertheless, to imagine that one could wait for the Poincar√© recurrence, and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. It is then evident that the appearance of irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the Poincar√© recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic equilibrium, as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics. Even if one could wait for it, one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at which to re-insert the wall. The Poincar√© recurrence theorem provides a solution to Loschmidt's paradox. If an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average Poincar√© recurrence time, the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal. James Clerk Maxwell Maxwell's demon James Clerk Maxwell imagined one container divided into two parts, A and B. Both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next to each other, separated by a wall. Observing the molecules on both sides, an imaginary demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall. When a faster-than-average molecule from A flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from A to B. The average speed of the molecules in B will have increased while in A they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in A and increases in B, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. One response to this question was suggested in 1929 by Le√≥ Szil√°rd and later by L√©on Brillouin. Szil√°rd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Maxwell's 'demon' repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between A and B. It is therefore performing thermodynamic operations on a microscopic scale, not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural macroscopic thermodynamic processes.

It is situated along the eastern bank of the Susquehanna. The Lackawanna River runs through the heart of Duryea's boundary. It was incorporated as a borough in 1901, and had an import switching rail yard, the Duryea yard (or Muller yard), connecting the central Wyoming Valley to destinations in lower New York and down-state Pennsylvania (in Harrisburg and Philadelphia). Coal mining and the manufacturing of silk were the chief industries in the early years of its existence. The population was 4,917 at the 2010 census. History=Early history Drawing of a Susquehannock (1624) The area now known as Duryea Borough was historically the heartland of the Susquehannock tribe, also called the Conestoga, which were an Iroquoian people whose territory extended from lower New York State to the Potomac. The Susquehannock befriended the Dutch traders by 1612, who soon began trading tools and firearms for furs. The Dutch had established their trading posts along the rivers near where two natural Indian trails allowed them to make contact with the Conestoga-- these were the sometimes disputed lands of the Susquehannocks and the rival Delaware nation (Lenape people). The Dutch, while buying the lands for their settlements on the Hudson and Delaware in Lenape lands, soon developed frictions with their hosts and eventually formed an alliance with the more warlike and fierce Susquehannocks. In the 1630s, the Susquehannocks and the Lenape people warred. In 1642, the British Province of Maryland declared war on the Susquehannocks and over eight mostly inconsequential years of warfare, while the Dutch allied themselves with the Susquehannocks, lost it to the Dutch and the Indians. A few years later, the English Sea Power defeated the Dutch ending their continued influence in North America. The Conestoga continued to grow in strength. In the 1660s, the area supported a military conquest which greatly weakened two of the western Iroquois tribes: the Seneca and Catagua. They were also struck by three years of plague (around 1670) in which 9 out of 10 Susquehannocks died. In the next few years, renewed war with the Iroquois kept the tribe from recovering and only a pale remnant of its strength relocated to the plains area now between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, where they came to deal with William Penn and the new colonial Province of Pennsylvania. Establishment Map of southern Duryea, northern Pittston, the Duryea Yard, and the confluence of the Lackawanna and Susquehanna rivers Lackawanna River in Duryea Forty original settlers arrived from Connecticut on February 8, 1769, and set up temporary cabins near the confluence of the Lackawanna and Susquehanna rivers, the area now at the southern end of Duryea Borough. One of the first settlers was Zebulon Marcy, from whom Marcy Township got its name. He built the first log cabin in 1770 on the west side of Duryea's present-day Main Street (not far from the Old Forge line). As more settlers located in the area, the development of mining caused the citizenry to petition for township status. Marcy Township was founded in 1880 with a population of 1,159. A census of the township in 1894 noted a population of 2,396 and 475 dwellings in a settlement. By the 1890s, the area was being called Duryea. Duryea grew in population and listed 1,005 registered voters in 1901, when it petitioned for reorganization as a Pennsylvania borough. The Borough of Duryea was incorporated on May 28, 1901; it was named in honor of Hiram Duryea, an American Civil War general and owner of extensive tracts of land in sections of the country. He was a prominent figure in the starch industry, a coal operator, and an official of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. It was the practice of this railroad to name its section stops after officials of the line, hence the name of Duryea. In one sense, like many communities in the country, the town is named after its railroad station. Coal mining Farming was the principal occupation in the early days. Pioneer settlers found many portions of the land suitable for raising food that they needed for existence. Shortly after, mining would become the area's greatest source of prosperity, along with silk mills and stone quarries. Three large colliers once operated around Duryea. As in other nearby communities, the coal was often mined directly under the town itself. Remnants of strip mines and culm banks still litter the landscape to this day. After the Knox Mine Disaster (1959), which occurred only several miles outside of Duryea, the mining industry in the Wyoming Valley collapsed. After the death of coal and the loss of the silk mill, the town encouraged the likes of Schott Optical and Topps Bubble Gum to establish medium-sized plants in the town. However, these would never replace the jobs and revenue provided by coal. The borough witnessed a declining population along with a shrinking enrollment within its schools. This resulted in the takeover of the town's schools by the Pittston Area School District. The remaining neighborhood schools were eventually phased out and shut down with Duryea Elementary being shut down in 1981. Early 21st century Duryea Yard (or Muller yard) The Reading & Northern Railroad Company invested in Duryea Yard (or Muller yard) in late 2009 and early 2010, laying track to accommodate 100 new rail cars and constructing a facility to store and hold up to 800 cars of sand to be used in hydraulic fracturing, or \\"fracking,\\" operations at Marcellus Shale drill sites throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. There is a sand quarry operating just north of the borough limits along a line once traversed by rails leaving the yard during its heyday.

In September 2011, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee caused severe flooding in the borough. It destroyed many homes and businesses along the Lackawanna River in Duryea, stretching from Phoenix Street to Elm Street. In the following days, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bob Casey visited the devastated sections of Duryea. Also in 2011, the borough received national attention for its role in the landmark Supreme Court case Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, in which the court stated that \\"a government employer's allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee's petition relates to a matter of public concern.\\" Government The following is a list of government officials from Duryea Borough.http://www.duryeaborough.com/officials.htm Officers *Mayor: Keith Moss *Council President: Jeffrey Bauman *Council Vice-President: John Rowlands Other councilors *Ed Ameika *James Gromelski *Lois Hanczyc *Michael McGlynn *Justin Tonte Geography The Borough of Duryea is located at (41.347729, -75.758302).

In the 1770s, English men, women, and children (European-Americans) started to settle in the Wyoming Valley of Northeastern Pennsylvania. On July 1, 1778, during the Revolutionary War, Fort Jenkins (a patriot stockade east of present-day Exeter) surrendered to the British (under Major John Butler). It was later burned to the ground. A couple days later, on July 3, 1778, a force of British soldiers, with the assistance of about 700 Indians, attacked and killed nearly 300 Wyoming Valley settlers in and around present-day Exeter. Present-day Exeter was founded in the middle of a fertile agricultural area-- once the heartland of the Susquehannock people--and much lumbering and coal- mining was carried out in the area in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1830s, the region entered a boom period and began shipping coal by the Pennsylvania Canal, and by the 1840s even down the Lehigh Canal to Allentown, Philadelphia, Trenton, Wilmington, New York City, and other East Coast cities and ports. This was done by the connecting engineering works of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company. These works included the upper Lehigh Canal, the Ashley Planes, the early Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, and other railroads in the area. After severe flooding ripped up the upper Lehigh Canal in the 1860s, the L&S; was extended to the Delaware along the lower canal, keeping the markets of the big cities connected to the still growing Wyoming Valley collieries and breakers. A second rail line was pushed up the Lehigh Gorge (the Lehigh Valley Railroad), which enabled a resurgent coal exportation to the East Coast cities; it also connected the region to the Erie Railroad and Buffalo, New York. Exeter was incorporated as a borough in 1884. By 1900, the population consisted of 1,948 citizens. The town lost usable lands in the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster, when the river broke through and flooded the local mines. This essentially shut down the coal mining industry in and around Exeter. Subsequently, despite the local loss of industry, the fact that the population was 5,652 at the 2010 census indicates that the former farmlands have been attractive to building developers.

Hundreds of American settlers were slaughtered by the British and Native Americans.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/exetertwp.htm The following year (1779), a scorched earth campaign was conducted by the Americans (who were commanded by Major General John Sullivan). They methodically destroyed many Native American villages (who were loyal to the British); this was partially the result of the Wyoming Massacre. Pennsylvania Route 92, which is the main road in Exeter Township, is roughly the trail of Sullivan's March.

The population was 1,276 at the 2010 census. Fairmount Township is home to Ricketts Glen State Park. The park receives tens of thousands of visitors each year. History=Early history Native American pot found along Kitchen Creek (c. 1890) Fairmount Township is in Pennsylvania, where humans have lived since at least 10000 BC. The first settlers in the state were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools.Kent, Smith, McCann, pp. 4, 7‚Äì11, 85‚Äì96, 195‚Äì201.Wallace (2005), pp. 4‚Äì12, 84‚Äì89, 99‚Äì105, 145‚Äì148, 157‚Äì164. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi- permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments. Fairmount Township is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After the demise of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers.Wallace (1987), pp. 66‚Äì72, 130‚Äì132. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).Donehoo, pp. 154‚Äì155, 215‚Äì219. The French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Fairmount Township.Wallace (2005), p. 159. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.Wallace (2005), pp. 136‚Äì141. In 1890, a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \\"the peoples of the Susquehanna region,\\" was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds.Wren, p. 56, Plate No. 7.  Township The first Europeans came to the region in the 18th century. The first settler in the township was John Franklin of Connecticut. Additional settlers followed in Franklin's footsteps (e.g., Levi Seward and Nathaniel Goss). Under the Connecticut title‚Äîprevious to 1776‚Äîit was originally known as Bloomingdale Township. The name was changed to Huntington Township in 1799 in honor of Samuel Huntington, a native of Connecticut and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Conety sold the land and a house he had built on the property (in 1880) to H. H. Derr of Wilkes-Barre. Derr purchased the property for fish and game. A few years later, Derr sold the property to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. In 1882, the Lehigh Valley Railroad (along with J.E. Patterson) organized the Glen Summit Hotel and Land Company. They purchased some adjoining land to their original purchase from Derr. The land was covered in scrub oak at the time, which allowed fantastic views of the valley that stretched before the westward face of Nescopeck Mountain. Over time this view was blocked by tree growth, but the addition of trees helped to increase the beauty of the neighborhood.

The Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport and the Wyoming Seminary Lower School are both located in the borough. History=Revolutionary War In the late 1770s, forty settlers from Westmoreland County, Connecticut, established a fortress along the Susquehanna River in the area now known as Forty Fort Borough. During the American Revolutionary War, both Connecticut and Pennsylvania claimed this territory, as Connecticut laid claim to a wide swath of land to its west based on its colonial charter. These competing claims were settled by exchanges and agreements with resolution by the national government after the United States gained independence. During the Revolutionary War, British forces arrived in the Wyoming Valley on June 30, 1778. The next day, Colonel Butler sent a surrender demand to the militia at Fort Wintermute. Terms were arranged that the defenders, after surrendering the fort with all their arms, would be released on the condition that they would not again bear arms during the war. On July 3, however, the British saw that the defenders were gathering in great numbers outside of Forty Fort. This led to the Battle of Wyoming. The next morning, July 4, Colonel Nathan Denison agreed to surrender Forty Fort and two other posts, along with what remained of his militia. Butler paroled them on their promise to take no part in further hostilities. Non-combatants were spared and only a few inhabitants were molested after the forts capitulated.Graymont, p. 172 In 1900, a large stone was placed at the end of Fort Street, in Forty Fort Borough, by the Daughters of the American Revolution to mark the approximate location of Forty Fort.Pearce, Annals of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1860)Smith, History of Wyoming Valley (Kingston, Pa., 1906) Post-Revolutionary War In the years following the Revolutionary War, Forty Fort became home to both the Nathan Denison House (built around 1790) and the Forty Fort Meetinghouse (built in 1806‚Äì08), which is located in the borough's cemetery. Forty Fort was officially incorporated as a borough in 1887. The borough later became home to the Lower School of the Wyoming Seminary and a portion of the southern end of the Wilkes-Barre Wyoming Valley Airport. Flooding In June 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused the Susquehanna River to overflow its banks. In Forty Fort, a portion of the levee protecting the town broke. This caused millions of dollars in damage to Forty Fort and the surrounding communities. In addition to structural damage, the Forty Fort Cemetery was heavily affected when over 2,000 caskets were washed away. Recovered bodies were eventually buried in a mass grave with a monument marking the 1972 flood's damage. In September 2011, the borough‚Äôs levee system was once again put to the test when Tropical Storm Lee caused severe flooding throughout the Wyoming Valley. However, this time the levee held, and the town was preserved from the catastrophe it witnessed in 1972.

The mayor is primarily responsible for the public safety of the borough. One function of the office is to serve as spokesperson for the community and to represent the borough at various civic and social events. The mayor also reviews each ordinance enacted by the borough council; he or she can sign it, veto it, or permit it to become law without signature. The mayor also has the authority to break a tie vote on borough council. Other various functions of the office include performing wedding ceremonies and administering oaths. The current mayor is Andy Tuzinski. In 2000, he was elected to borough council and served two terms. He also served as the president of the borough council from 2000 to 2005. He was elected mayor in 2013 and assumed office in 2014. Education Forty Fort is part of the Wyoming Valley West School District.

The population was 3,467 at the 2010 census. History A map of western Foster Township (1873) Founding Modern-day Foster Township was first settled in 1824 by John Lines. In 1855, territory was taken from Dennison Township to create a new municipality in Luzerne County; the new territory was incorporated as a township in 1855. It is named after Asa L. Foster. At the time, coal mining and logging were the two major industries in Foster Township.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/foster.htm Eckley Miners‚Äô VillageEarly years= Before the 1850s, Eckley was not a mining town, but a rural, forested community called Shingletown. It was located on land owned by Tench Coxe. The inhabitants took advantage of the surrounding woodlands and made shingles to be sold in White Haven and Hazleton. These goods were traded for the necessities of life, such as whiskey, port, and tobacco. =Discovery of coal= In 1853, four prospectors came to Shingletown and discovered that the land contained several veins of coal. Within the year, the Sharpe, Leisenring, and Company, later known as the Sharpe, Weiss, and Company, was formed. Judge Charles Coxe of Philadelphia, executor of the Tench Coxe Estate, granted the company a 20-year lease for the establishment and operation of a colliery on the 1,500 acres (6 km¬≤) of land. In 1854, the company began to construct a colliery. By autumn of 1854, the company had constructed a saw mill to provide lumber necessary for the colliery buildings, such as the breaker and stable. Shingletown was renamed Fillmore, presumably in honor of President Millard Fillmore who left office in 1853. The town was later renamed Eckley (in 1857) in honor of Judge Coxe‚Äôs eldest son, Eckley B. Coxe. In later years, Eckley Coxe, an engineer, became involved in the operations of the village. =European immigration= The first residents of Eckley were mostly English and Welsh immigrants who came from the mines in Great Britain. By the late 1850s and early 1860s, these miners were joined by groups of Irish farmers, who had immigrated to America after the devastating famine in their homeland. By the 1880s and 1890s, a new wave of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe entered Eckley. These groups included people from Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Italy. =Modern times= The Molly Maguires‚Äîa 1970 movie‚Äîwas filmed in Eckley in 1969. The Eckley Miners' Village was finally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

It was originally called Birbeckville, South Heberton, and Freehold. Freeland is south of Wilkes-Barre and northeast of Hazleton. It was incorporated as a borough on September 11, 1876. Coal mining was the chief industry in the community up until the mid-20th century. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,531. History=Establishment Foster Township (Freehold and South Heberton merged to create modern-day Freeland) Joseph Birkbeck, the founder of Freeland, was born near Brough, in the county of Westmorland, England, on May 2, 1802. He and his wife Elizabeth came to America in 1844. After acquiring land from Edward Lynch the same year of his arrival, Birkbeck built a log cabin in a small valley between modern-day Freeland and Upper Lehigh. The next settler, Nathan Howey, purchased land from Birkbeck and built a frame house just west of Birkbeck's log cabin. Coal mining Developing coal mines in the nearby region created a steep increase in population and a demand for building lots. This led Birkbeck to survey the region for the town of South Heberton. South Heberton has long since lost its identity and is now simply a cluster of houses along Schwabe Street, which is now part of Freeland.Foster Township, Luzerne Co., Pa Between 1845 and 1846, Birkbeck built a highway through South Heberton, Eckley Miners' Village, and Buck Mountain; it was known as Buck Mountain Road. Eckley was then known as Shingletown, as the chief industry there was the production of shingles. The first child born at South Heberton was Elizabeth Birkbeck, the daughter of founder Joseph Birkbeck and his wife Elizabeth, in 1845. The first death at this place was that of William, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth Birkbeck, which occurred February 11, 1846. He was four years old at the time.Freeland: First Settlers The first store at South Heberton was owned by a man named Feist. It was located west of Birkbeck's cabin. The first tavern was founded by Nathan Howey, the second settler in the region. Prior to the opening of Howey's tavern, Birkbeck accommodated parties, who were prospecting for anthracite deposits, in his own home.

In 1883, the first Slovak Lutheran Church in America was organized in Freeland.Article on Slovaks in America, see religion subsection The population steadily increased due to the expanding coal mining industry in the region. Many Europeans immigrated to Freeland up until the mid-20th century. Present day Little League field in Freeland The coal mining industry in and around Freeland collapsed after the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster in northern Luzerne County. As of 2017, Freeland had a YMCA program, a community park, the Hazleton Area Public Library (Freeland Branch), and a remodeled Little League field. Also, there is a football/baseball field named \\"Della Croce Field,\\" after Gene Della Croce, the former Director of the Freeland YMCA. Along with the several parks and fields, several restaurants still remain in Freeland including The Other Side, Sorrento's Pizza, The Garlic Knot, and Garden Chen Chinese Food. A CVS Pharmacy is also located in the central part of Freeland. Customs Since a large demographic of people in Freeland are of Irish descent, every year, there is a St. Patrick's Day parade through downtown, which is followed by a dinner. There are also annual events for Memorial Day and Veterans Day, due to the large amount of retired and active duty soldiers living in the surrounding communities. As part of the Memorial Day celebration, an annual Pub Run takes place, in which participants run a course with bars along the way. Participants must stop and finish a drink at each bar before continuing the race.

The population was 1,873 at the 2010 census. History The town of Glen Lyon was founded after anthracite coal mining began in Newport Township (ca. 1869). The colliery was operated by the Susquehanna Coal Company, a Pennsylvania Railroad property. The west side of the community was once called Morgantown; the east side was referred to as Williamstown. Later, the Glen Lyon Rail Station was established and the town was named after the terminus. Part of the east side, which was separated from the rest of the community by the railroad, became known as Canada. Roads and a streetcar line linked the town to Nanticoke and Wilkes-Barre. The streetcar line was replaced eventually by buses and automobiles as the main means of transport. A hill divided the community into two parts. Sixth Shaft was established on the hill. Coal hoisted from that mine was moved across a bridge to the breaker (coal processing plant), which was built in 1887. Gravity moved the coal through a series of stages. The coal would then come out the north end of the breaker, where it was loaded onto railroad cars and trucks. The Seventh Shaft colliery operated west of Glen Lyon. The town was originally developed by Welsh miners (who were Protestants); they were usually members of the Methodist church. There was a small Methodist church on Market Street. Later, immigrants from Central Europe (e.g., Poland) and Southern Europe became predominant. Two Polish Catholic parishes, Saint Adalbert's and Saint Michael's, were founded in the late nineteenth century. Their churches were built on the west side of the breaker. Other European miners and their families belonged to Ukrainian or \\"Byzantine Rite\\" parishes on the east side of town. A company-operated store existed for quite some time in Glen Lyon; it closed in the 1920s. Commercial structures were erected on Nanticoke Street, later Main Street, providing food and supplies to the community. Several neighborhood taverns existed throughout the town. Glen Lyon's miners were involved in unionization activities, culminating in their representation by the United Mine Workers. Mining declined after the Second World War. The M. A. Hanna Company closed Seventh Shaft but retained Sixth Shaft and its breaker well into the 1960s. The breaker closed in 1971; it later burned overnight in October 1974. The death of deep mining in Northeastern Pennsylvania after the 1959 Knox Mine Disaster also diminished the town. However, some strip mining did continue in the following years. Small dress factories provided employment, mostly for women, in the period when mining was in decline; but they too closed. Retirees formed a large portion of the population. Many businesses closed as deep mining declined, and increasing numbers of houses stood vacant. The Roman Catholic churches were gradually consolidated, and St. Michael's was demolished (ca. 2004). St. Dennis, the \\"Irish\\" church, became a possession of the Knights of Columbus. The 1948 film The Miracle of the Bells is nominally set in Glen Lyon, and some scenes were shot there.

Captain Lazarus Stewart and dozens of his followers moved from Lancaster County into the Wyoming Valley in 1770; they fought for Connecticut in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars. For their service to Connecticut, Captain Stewart and his followers were granted a tract of land which became Hanover Township. The community was named after Lazarus Stewart's hometown of Hanover in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. In the early 1770s, Captain Lazarus Stewart built the first house in the Breslau section of the township (between Solomon Creek and the Susquehanna River).http://www.hanovertownship.org/history.html Native American raids were very common in the Wyoming Valley in the 18th century. On July 3, 1778, British and Native American forces massacred American settlers in present-day Exeter. Over two dozen Hanover Township residents were killed in the fight (including Captain Lazarus Stewart).http://www.hanovertownship.org/history.html The original township occupied all the land from Wilkes-Barre to Newport Township, and all the land between the Susquehanna River and the Lehigh River. In the 19th century, the original township downsized when sections of it broke away to form new municipalities (e.g., townships, boroughs, and cities). In the following decades, coal mining became the major industry in and around Hanover Township. Coal breakers were constructed throughout the region. One, in particular, was built in modern-day Ashley Borough; it was known as the Huber Breaker. After the collapse of the mining industry in the Wyoming Valley, the breaker was demolished in 2014.

It is part of the Back Mountain, a 118 square mile region in northern Luzerne County. The borough is named after the lake, its principal feature, which in turn was named after Benjamin Harvey, who discovered it in 1781. Harvey was a member of the Sons of Liberty, an eminent colonial-era group that fought against Great Britain's Stamp Act of 1765. As of the 2010 census, the population of the borough of Harveys Lake was 2,791. History Old postcard of Harveys Lake Harveys Lake was not officially incorporated as a borough until 1968. Prior to that, the area was an unincorporated part of Lake Township. Historically, the first resident in the vicinity of the lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806. Harveys Lake became a major resort destination in the early 20th century, attracting tourists from all over the Northeast. Hotels, cottages, boathouses, a casino, and even an amusement park were constructed around the lake. The grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s; former United States President Theodore Roosevelt was a guest in August 1912. From 1952 to 1956, Pennsylvania State Senator T. Newell Wood hosted the Brynfan Tyddyn Road Race around his estate in Harveys Lake. Brynfan Tyddyn is Welsh for \\"large farm on a hilltop\\" and the race consisted of 10 laps around a 3.5 mile course around the estate. The race was discontinued in 1957 after a fatal accident and officials determined the course was too dangerous and difficult for participants and spectators to reach.

The population was 9,549 at the 2010 census. History=Establishment Delaware and Seneca tribes traveled through what is now southern Luzerne County to trade with other Native American settlements in New York and the Chesapeake Bay area. The most common route for the Native Americans was known as ‚ÄúWarriors Path,‚Äù which was also used by white settlers in the 18th century. Broad Street (PA 93) is roughly the location of the trail.http://www.hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle-township Moravian missionaries were among the first Europeans to travel to the region; they wanted to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The Hazleton area was then a shallow valley with an abundance of hazel trees. It's speculated that the Native Americans were the first to refer to the area as ‚ÄúHazle Swamp.‚Äùhttp://hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle-township Coal mining Lattimer Colliery (1890) At the beginning of the 19th century, Native Americans abandoned their territory in the east while white settlers continued to move into the region. In 1804, a private company widened ‚ÄúWarriors Path,‚Äù which was renamed the Berwick Turnpike. As a result, logging became the major industry in the area. Logging remained the largest industry in southern Luzerne County until the 1830s, when anthracite coal was discovered under the land that had been cleared. In 1836, the first mines and settlements were established in present-day Hazle Township.http://hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle-township Hazle Township was formed from a section of Sugarloaf Township in 1839; in 1856, a portion of Butler Township was added to Hazle Township.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/hazleton.htm By the mid-19th century, the territory had changed dramatically from its early days. The expanding coal industry led to more extensive roads, railroads, and housing settlements. Immigrants, mostly from Europe, came to Greater Hazleton by the thousands to work in the dangerous mines. For the next century, large amounts of coal from Hazle Township were shipped by train to the lucrative Philadelphia market.http://hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle- township =Lattimer Massacre= Mine workers began their protest march near Harwood; 19 were later killed by the Luzerne County sheriff in Lattimer. On September 10, 1897, about 300 to 400 unarmed strikers‚Äînearly all of them Slavs and Germans‚Äîmarched to a coal mine owned by Calvin Pardee (in the town of Lattimer in Hazle Township) to support a newly formed UMW union. The demonstrators were confronted by law enforcement officials several times on the road; they were ordered to disperse, but kept marching. The deputies had spent most of the morning joking about how many miners they would kill.Novak, Michael. The Guns of Lattimer. Reprint ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996; While on a streetcar headed for Lattimer (with the sheriff and his comrades), one deputy was overheard saying \\"I bet I drop six of them when I get over there.\\" When the demonstrators reached Lattimer at 3:45 pm, they were met again by the sheriff and 150 armed deputies. Sources differ on the number of deputies present. One source claims only 86 deputies confronted the marchers. Sheriff Martin ordered the marchers to disperse, and then attempted to grab an American flag out of the hands of the lead marcher. A scuffle ensued, and the police opened fire on the unarmed crowd. Nineteen miners died, and anywhere from 17 to 49 others wounded. All had been shot in the back, and several had multiple gunshot wounds which indicated that they had been targeted by the deputies.Anderson, John W.

Life after coal The Laurel Mall, Hazle Township The population of Hazle Township peaked at nearly 15,000 residents in the early 20th century. By the 1940s, the population began to dwindle; this was the result of the declining coal industry. Many mines closed in the 1940s and 1950s. Many residents were forced to seek jobs elsewhere.http://hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle-township Although the region was in the midst of an economic recession, local leaders were determined to turn the economy around. CAN-DO (Community Area New Development Organization) was formally organized in 1956 by founder Dr. Edgar L. Dessen. It was founded to bring new industry into the area. Their first priority was to raise money‚Äîthrough their \\"Dime a Week\\" campaign‚Äîin which area residents were encouraged to put a dime on their sidewalk each week to be collected by CAN-DO. The company raised over $250,000 and was able to purchase over 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land, which was converted into an industrial park.http://www.hazletownship.com/index.php/area/history-of-hazle-township CAN-DO was responsible for establishing the Valmont, Humboldt, and McAdoo industrial parks.

The population was 2,244 at the 2010 census. History Bittenbender Covered Bridge Huntington Township is located in western Luzerne County. This area is also known as the Wyoming Valley. In 1762, there was an attempt to settle the land by the Susquehanna Company. The Susquehanna Company was composed of about 600 citizens from Windham County, Connecticut. The Company was sent to settle the modern-day counties of Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Bradford, and Susquehanna. However, due to constant trouble with Indians in the area and the Revolutionary War (from 1775 to 1783), progress was slow. The first settler, John Franklin, came from Connecticut as one of the Susquehanna landowners. He was soon followed by the families of Levi Seward, Nathaniel Goss, Abraham Hess, and Reuben Culver (all of whom were influential settlers in Huntington Township). Finally, following the Revolutionary War, under the acts of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania passed in 1799, Huntington Township was created along with seventeen other certified townships in the counties of Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Bradford, and Susquehanna. Previous to the acts of the Assembly, Huntington Township was known as Bloomingdale Township and considered part of Connecticut. However, in 1799, once the township was inducted into Luzerne County, Bloomingdale Township was renamed Huntington Township after Samuel Huntington (one of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence). The Bittenbender Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

It is located on the western bank of the Susquehanna River opposite Wilkes-Barre City. Kingston was first settled in the early 1770s; it was later incorporated as a borough in 1857. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,182, making it the most populous borough in the county. History=Early history Drawing of a Susquehannock (1624) In the early 1660s, King Charles II owed Admiral Sir William Penn a large sum of money. To settle this debt, he granted Penn‚Äôs son, William, a territory in North America, which later became known as Pennsylvania. However, Connecticut also claimed a portion of this land. Count Zinzendorf was one of the first people to take an interest in the Wyoming Valley. In 1742, he came to the region to convert the Native Americans to Christianity. At the time, the valley was inhabited by several Native American tribes (including the Susquehannock and the Delaware). His reports led a group of Connecticut settlers to form the Connecticut Susquehanna Company. This company bought the land from the natives. In 1768, they met in Hartford, Connecticut, and decided to survey and divide the territory into five townships (each one was five square miles). The plan was to sell and divide each township among forty settlers. The first forty pioneers took possession of Kingston Township. By the late 1760s, both Connecticut and Pennsylvania settlers fought over this territory. The conflict was eventually settled in the 1780s. The disputed land was granted to Pennsylvania. The location of modern-day Kingston became part of Northumberland County. However, Connecticut settlers remained determined to create a new state in northeastern Pennsylvania. Timothy Pickering was sent to the region to politically examine the situation. This led to the Pennsylvania Assembly passing a resolution which created Luzerne County. This ended the idea of creating a new state. Luzerne County was created from part of Northumberland County. Under Pickering‚Äôs leadership and direction, county elections were held, the courts were established, and a government was formed. The Revolutionary War The Battle of Wyoming During the Revolutionary War, British forces arrived in the Wyoming Valley on June 30, 1778. The next day ‚Äî July 1 ‚Äî Colonel Butler sent a surrender demand to the militia at Fort Wintermute (Wintermoot). Terms were arranged that the defenders, after surrendering the fort with all their arms, would be released on the condition that they would not again bear arms during the war. The American militia at Fort Wintermute surrendered that same day. Several miles away, Fort Jenkins (a Patriot stockade in present-day West Pittston) also capitulated. It was later burned to the ground. On July 3, the British spotted the American militia near Forty Fort. Butler wanted to lure the Americans away from their fortifications. He ordered for Fort Wintermute to be set ablaze. The Patriots, believing it signified a British retreat, advanced rapidly. British soldiers, with the assistance of about 700 Native Americans, ambushed the oncoming American militia. In the end, nearly 300 Wyoming Valley settlers were killed in what would be known as the Wyoming Massacre. Today, in the Borough of Wyoming, a monument marks the gravesite of the victims from the battle. The next morning, July 4, Colonel Nathan Denison agreed to surrender Forty Fort and two other posts, along with what remained of his militia. Butler paroled them on their promise to take no part in further hostilities. Non-combatants were spared and only a few inhabitants were molested after the forts capitulated.Graymont, p. 172Pearce, Annals of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1860)Smith, History of Wyoming Valley (Kingston, Pa., 1906) The war ended in 1783 when America finally gained its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Incorporation The community has a rich history in American education. It is said that the first public school in Pennsylvania was erected in Kingston (in the 1770s). The borough is also home to the Upper School of Wyoming Seminary, a prestigious college preparatory school founded in 1844. During the first year, it enrolled 31 students (17 boys and 14 girls). Today, Wyoming Seminary's historic campus hosts roughly 450 students. Kingston witnessed a population boom after the construction and operation of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad. It was incorporated as a borough on November 23, 1857. The borough is named after Kingston, Rhode Island. The first election for the community was held on December 15, 1857. Ruben Jones was elected burgess and justice of the peace. Some of the first council members elected included Bestor Payne, Marshall G. Whitney, Reuben Marcy, Thomas Pringle, and Richard Hutching. In 1923, the Kingston Armory was built. On September 11, 1950, 33 guardsmen from the 109th Field Artillery Regiment were killed in a train accident near Coshocton, Ohio. In the following days, the dead were moved to the Kingston Armory, where the remains were relinquished to the grief-stricken families. Coal mining was a chief industry in and around Kingston prior to the Knox Mine Disaster. The 1959 tragedy essentially shut down the mining industry in and around the borough. In June 1972, Kingston was devastated by the flooding of Hurricane Agnes. The hurricane wreaked havoc on Kingston and neighboring Wilkes-Barre, causing a state of emergency. The natural disaster earned national attention and a visit from President Richard Nixon, who recruited Wyoming Seminary graduate Frank Carlucci (Nixon's head of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) as a point man to oversee flood recovery efforts. After the flood, Kingston adopted a home rule charter. It became effective in January 1976.

The population was 6,999 at the 2010 census. The villages of Trucksville and Shavertown are located within the township. It is home to Frances Slocum State Park. The township is described as \\"the gateway to the Back Mountain\\" (a 118 square mile region in northern Luzerne County). The area includes the townships of Dallas, Franklin, Jackson, Kingston, Lake, and Lehman. The region also includes the boroughs of Dallas and Harveys Lake. History An old map of Kingston Township Establishment Kingston Township was one of the original townships formed by the Susquehanna Land Company of Connecticut in 1790. The township is named after Kingston, Rhode Island, and was originally called ‚ÄúKingstown.‚Äù The township was later downsized when whole regions were stripped away to form new municipalities (i.e., townships and boroughs).http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/ktwp.htm Shavertown and Trucksville Shavertown is named for an early settler ‚Äî Philip Shaver. In 1813, Philip purchased the land that would later become Shavertown from William Trucks, the namesake of Trucksville. That same year, Philip sold the northwest portion of his land to John McClellon. This land would be known as McClellonsville, a small village which was later named Dallas. By 1818, Philip still owned nearly one thousand acres of land in the Back Mountain region. Philip Shaver was born in 1762 along the Danube River Valley in Vienna, Austria. He migrated to the United States between 1765‚Äì1769 with his parents and brothers. Philip Shaver married Mary Ann Wickizer at St. James Lutheran Church (in Greenwich, Warren County, New Jersey, on December 12, 1786). They had 7 children: John Philip, Peter, William G., Elizabeth, James Henry, George, and Asa W. Shaver. Around 1804, Philip and his family arrived in Forty Fort, where they resided until 1810. Philip came to the ‚ÄúBack of the Mountain‚Äù in search of a gigantic species of legendary evergreen trees. He was forced to carve out a path from a rugged foot trail and among heavily forested lands, now PA 309. Philip and his sons constructed a sawmill in 1815. This first mill was on the north branch of Toby Creek and located near the Prince of Peace Church on Main Street in Dallas. In 1816, he donated a piece of land for the first school in the Back Mountain. The school was a one-room log cabin on the site of the current Back Mountain Memorial Library on Huntsville Road. Philip also set aside land for a public burying ground ‚Äúon the hill near the pine grove just south of Dallas Village (on the road to Huntsville).‚Äù Philip also designated a plot of land for his family‚Äôs graves, visible from Overbrook Road. In 1826, Philip died after a fatal accident. His left hand was crushed in the cider press that he and his sons were operating in November 1826. Philip was forced to amputate his own hand and died of blood poisoning a few days later on November 7, 1826.  Frances Slocum Frances Slocum State Park is located in Kingston Township. In 1968, the lake, which is the centerpiece of the park, was built to control flooding in the North Branch Susquehanna River. In 1972, the park became a temporary home to 280 families who were displaced by the Agnes flood. The park was closed to the public; it was not reopened until 1974 when all the families were relocated. Geography Swampland in Frances Slocum State Park According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.87%, is water. Kingston Township is densely populated in the southwestern section of the municipality; this is where the villages of Shavertown and Trucksville are located. PA 309 also travels through this portion of the township. Kingston Township is known as \\"the gateway to the Back Mountain,\\" because two major roadways ‚Äî PA 309 and West Eighth Street (in the northeastern section of the municipality) ‚Äî link the Back Mountain (Kingston Township) to the Anthracite Valley (also known as the Wyoming Valley). Frances Slocum State Park is located in the northeastern portion of the township. Carverton Road runs through the center of Kingston Township and links PA 309 to West Eighth Street. Farms and forests are located in the northern and southern sections of the municipality. Kingston Township is part of Dallas School District (which encompasses approximately 46 square miles). Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 7,145 people, 2,745 households, and 2,083 families residing in the township. The population density was 526.2 people per square mile (203.1/km2). There were 2,923 housing units at an average density of 215.3 per square mile (83.1/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 98.95% White, 0.24% African American, 0.06% Native American, 0.28% Asian, 0.08% from other races, and 0.39% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.38% of the population. There were 2,745 households, out of which 35.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.7% were married couples living together, 8.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.1% were non-families. 20.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.02. In the township the population was spread out, with 24.9% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 27.1% from 45 to 64, and 12.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.2 males. The median income for a household in the township was $52,997, and the median income for a family was $62,435. Males had a median income of $40,872 versus $30,075 for females. The per capita income for the township was $23,885. About 4.2% of families and 4.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.2% of those under age 18 and 3.6% of those age 65 or over.

It was designed during the mid-1930s at Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey. Led by Vickers-Armstrongs' chief designer Rex Pierson; a key feature of the aircraft is its geodetic airframe fuselage structure, which was principally designed by Barnes Wallis. Development had been started in response to Air Ministry Specification B.9/32, issued in the middle of 1932, for a bomber for the Royal Air Force. This specification called for a twin- engined day bomber capable of delivering higher performance than any previous design. Other aircraft developed to the same specification include the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Handley Page Hampden. During the development process, performance requirements such as for the tare weight changed substantially, and the engine used was not the one originally intended. The Wellington was used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War, performing as one of the principal bombers used by Bomber Command. During 1943, it started to be superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined \\"heavies\\" such as the Avro Lancaster. The Wellington continued to serve throughout the war in other duties, particularly as an anti-submarine aircraft. It holds the distinction of having been the only British bomber that was produced for the duration of the war, and of having been produced in a greater quantity than any other British-built bomber. The Wellington remained as first-line equipment when the war ended, although it had been increasingly relegated to secondary roles. The Wellington was one of two bombers named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the other being the Vickers Wellesley. A larger heavy bomber aircraft designed to Specification B.1/35, the Vickers Warwick, was developed in parallel with the Wellington; the two aircraft shared around 85% of their structural components. Many elements of the Wellington were also re-used in a civil derivative, the Vickers VC.1 Viking. Development=Origins Wellingtons under construction, showing the geodesic airframe RNZAF Wellington Mark I aircraft with the original turrets; anticipating war, the New Zealand government loaned these aircraft and their aircrews to the RAF in August 1939 In October 1932, the British Air Ministry invited Vickers to tender for the recently issued Specification B.9/32, which sought a twin-engine medium daylight bomber. In response, Vickers conducted a design study, led by Chief Designer Rex Pierson Early on, Vickers' chief structures designer Barnes Wallis proposed the use of a geodesic airframe, inspired by his previous work on airships and the single- engined Wellesley light bomber.Andrews 1967, p. 3. During structural testing performed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, the proposed structure demonstrated not only the required strength factor of six, but reached 11 without any sign of failure, proving the geodesic airframe to possess a strength far in excess of normal levels. This strength allowed for the structure design to be further developed to reduce the size of individual members and adopt simplified standard sections of lighter construction. Vickers studied and compared the performance of various air- and liquid-cooled engines to power the bomber, including the Bristol Pegasus IS2, Pegasus IIS2, and Armstrong Siddeley Tiger radials, and the Rolls-Royce Goshawk I inline. The Pegasus was selected as the engine for air-cooled versions of the bomber, while the Goshawk engine was chosen for the liquid-cooled engine variant. On 28 February 1933, two versions of the aircraft, one with each of the selected powerplants, were submitted to the tender. In September 1933, the Air Ministry issued a pilot contract for the Goshawk-powered version. In August 1934, Vickers proposed to use either the Pegasus or the sleeve-valve Bristol Perseus engines instead of the evaporative-cooled Goshawk, which promised improvements in speed, climb rate, ceiling, and single-engine flight capabilities without any major increase in all-up weight; the Air Ministry accepted the proposed changes.Andrews 1967, p. 6. Other refinements of the design had also been implemented and approved, such as the adoption of variable-pitch propellers, and the use of Vickers-produced gun turrets in the nose and tail positions. By December 1936, the specification had been revised to include front, rear, and midship wind-protected turret mountings. Other specification changes included modified bomb undershields and the inclusion of spring-loaded bomb bay doors.Andrews 1967, pp. 5‚Äì6. The proposal had also been developed further, a mid-wing arrangement was adopted instead of a shoulder-mounted wing for greater pilot visibility during formation flight and improved aerodynamic performance, as well as a substantially increased overall weight of the aircraft. Design studies were also conducted on behalf of the Air Ministry into the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. In spite of a traditional preference of the establishment to strictly adhere to the restrictive tare weight for the aircraft established in the tender, both Pierson and Wallis firmly believed that their design should adopt the most powerful engine available. Perhaps in response to pressure from Vickers, the Air Ministry overlooked, if not openly accepted, the removal of the tare weight restriction, as between the submission of the tender in 1933 and the flight of the first prototype in 1936, the tare weight eventually rose from to .Andrews 1967, pp. 3, 5‚Äì6.Buttler (Fighters and Bombers 1935-1950 2004. British Secret Projects 3. Midland Publishing p93) notes that Specification B.3/34 had a higher tare weight because of the lapse of international agreement in 1934 on the weights on bombers and Vickers declined to tender to the specification because they were already scaling up the Type 271 design to where it would meet the specification. The prescribed bomb load and range requirements were routinely revised upwards by the Air Ministry; by November 1935, figures within the Ministry were interested in the possibility of operating the aircraft at an all-up weight of , which aviation author C.F. Andrews stated to be \\"a very high figure for a medium bomber of those days\\". During the development phase of the aircraft, \\"the political and military climate of Europe was changing rapidly. The threats of the dictators of Germany and Italy began to exert pressure on the British Government to make a reappraisal of the strength of its armed forces, especially that of the Royal Air Force\\". By 1936, the need for a high priority to be placed on the creation of a large bomber force, which would form the spearhead of British offensive power, had been recognised; accordingly, a new command organisation within the RAF, Bomber Command, was formed that year to deliver upon this requirement. Prototype and design revision In early 1936, an initial prototype, K4049, which was originally designated as a Type 271, was assembled. The prototype could accommodate a payload of nine 250lb or 500lb bombs, and both nose and tail gun positions were fitted with hand-operated turrets furnished with a single gun in each, provisions for a third retractable gun in a dorsal position were also present. It had provisions for a crew of four, along with a fifth position for performing special duties. On 5 June 1936, the name Crecy was initially chosen for the type, and it was publicly displayed as such. On 15 August 1936, the aircraft was accepted for production. On 8 September 1936, the name Wellington was adopted for the type; it fitted with Air Ministry nomenclature of naming bombers after towns and also followed on from the Vickers Wellesley in referring to the Napoleonic War general Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. On 12 December 1936, a corresponding works order was issued for the Wellington. On 15 June 1936, K4049 conducted its maiden flight from Brooklands. Vickers chief test pilot Joseph Summers flew K4049 on its first flight, accompanied by Wallis and Trevor Westbrook. The aircraft soon came to be largely regarded as being an advanced design for its era and proved to have considerable merit during its flight trials.Andrews 1967, pp. 6‚Äì7. On 19 April 1937, K4049 was destroyed by an accident during a service test flight by Maurice Hare. The cause was the failure of the elevator's horn balance due to excessive slipstream exposure, leading to the aircraft inverting and rapidly descending into terrain. It was completely destroyed in the crash, which also resulted in the death of Smurthwaite the navigator.Andrews 1967, p. 7. The horn balances would later be deleted, and thus not feature on production aircraft. In addition to the prototype, refinement of the Wellington's design was influenced by the issuing of Specifications B.3/34 and B.1/35, the latter of which had led to the parallel development of a larger bomber aircraft, the Vickers Warwick.Andrews 1967, pp. 7, 10. According to Andrews, the Wellington was practically redesigned to form the first production model of the aircraft, during which extensive details attributed to the Warwick were added, such as the deepening of the fuselage, the lengthening of the nose, a reshaped horizontal tail unit, and an increased crew complement for four to five members.Andrews 1967, p. 10. Other changes made included the adoption of a retractable tailwheel and constant-speed propellers; the Air Ministry also requested the adoption of a Nash & Thompson-design ventral turret in place of the Vickers design. On 23 December 1937, the first production Wellington Mk I, L4212, conducted its first flight; L4212 subsequently participated in an intensive flight programme.Andrews 1967, pp. 10‚Äì11. Flight trials with L4212 confirmed the aerodynamic stability initially encountered by K4049, but also revealed the aircraft to be nose-heavy during dives, which was attributed to the redesigned elevator. Accordingly, modifications, including the interlinking of the flaps and the elevator trim tabs, were successfully trialled on L4212 to resolve the issue.Andrews 1967, p. 11. Production A war time poster using a cutaway of a Vickers Wellington to illustrate how scrap and salvage was recycled for use in the production of war material. The poster expands on how different materials were used to make specific components of the bomber. In August 1936, an initial order for 180 Wellington Mk I aircraft, powered by a pair of 1,050 hp (780 kW) Bristol Pegasus radial engines, was received by Vickers; it had been placed so rapidly that the order occurred prior to the first meeting intended to decide the details of the production aircraft.Andrews 1967, pp. 3‚Äì4. In October 1937, another order for a further 100 Wellington Mk Is, produced by the Gloster Aircraft Company, was issued; it was followed by an order for 100 Wellington Mk II aircraft, which were instead powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Merlin X V12 engines.Andrews 1967, p. 4. Yet another order was placed for 64 Wellingtons produced by Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. With this flurry of order and production having been assured by the end of 1937, Vickers set about simplifying the manufacturing process of the aircraft and announced a target of building one Wellington per day. No.428 Sqn. RCAF. It completed its bomb run despite losing the rear turret and then flew back home for a successful landing with its bomb bay doors stuck open due to lack of hydraulic power The geodesic design took longer to build than comparable aircraft using the more conventional monocoque approach, leading to some criticism of the Wellington. In addition it was difficult to cut holes in the fuselage for access or equipment fixtures; to aid manufacturing, the Leigh light was deployed through the mounting for the absent FN9 ventral turret. In the late 1930s, Vickers built Wellingtons at a rate of one per day at Weybridge and 50 a month at Broughton in North Wales.Andrews 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. Many of the employees on the production lines were only semi-skilled and new to aircraft construction. Peak wartime production in 1942 saw monthly rates of 70 at Weybridge, 130 at Broughton and 102 at Blackpool. Shadow factories were set up to produce parts for the Wellington all over the British Isles. In October 1943, as a propaganda and morale-boosting exercise, workers at Broughton gave up their weekend to build Wellington number LN514 rushed by the clock. The bomber was assembled in 23 hours 50 minutes, and took off after 24 hours 48 minutes, beating the record of 48 hours set by a factory in California. Each Wellington was usually built within 60 hours. It was filmed for the Ministry of Information for a newsreel Worker's Week-End, and was broadcast in both Britain and America.\\"Building a bomber plane in just a day.\\" BBC News Magazine, 13 September 2010.\\"Workers weekend\\" \\"Workers weekend (video)\\"The National Archives. Retrieved: 12 February 2014. It was the first time in aviation history that an aircraft manufacturer anywhere in the world had attempted such a feat with a metal aircraft of this scale. A total of 180 Wellington Mk I aircraft were built; 150 for the RAF and 30 for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) (which were transferred to the RAF on the outbreak of war and used by 75 Squadron). In October 1938, the Mk I entered service with 9 Squadron. The Wellington was initially outnumbered by the Handley Page Hampden (also ordered by the Ministry to B.9/32) and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley (to B.34/3 for a 'night' bomber) but outlasted both rival aircraft in service. The Wellington went on to be built in 16 separate variants, in addition to two training conversions after the war. The number of Wellingtons built totalled 11,462 of all versions, a greater quantity produced than any other British bomber. On 13 October 1945, the last Wellington to be produced rolled out. Further development The Wellington Mk I was quickly superseded by several successive variants featuring various improvements. Improvements to the turrets and the strengthening of the undercarriage quickly resulted in the Wellington Mk IA. According to Andrews, the IA model bore more similarities to the later Wellington Mk II than to its Mk I predecessor. Due to armament difficulties encountered that left the Wellington with weaker than intended defences, the Wellington Mk IB was proposed for trials, but appears to have been unbuilt. Further development of various aspects of the aircraft, such as the hydraulics and electrical systems, along with a revision of the ventral turret gun, led to the Wellington Mk IC.Andrews 1967, pp. 11‚Äì12. In January 1938, design work on what would become the Wellington Mk II formally commenced. The principal change on this model was the adoption of the Merlin engine in place of the Pegasus XVIII; other modifications included hydraulic and oxygen system revisions along with the installation of cabin heating and an astrodome.Andrews 1967, pp. 12‚Äì13. On 3 March 1939, L4250, the prototype Mk II, performed its maiden flight; this had been delayed due to production delays of its Merlin X engines.Andrews 1967, p. 12. Stability and balance issues were encountered during flight tests of the prototype, resulting in further changes such as the enlargement of the tailplane. By late 1939, the Mk II was capable of delivering superior performance to the Mk IC, such as higher cruising and top speeds, increased all-up weight or alternatively greater range, and a raised ceiling.Andrews 1967, p. 13. Design The tail turret of a Wellington, 1942 The Vickers Wellington was a twin-engined long-range medium bomber, initially powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus radial engines, which drove a pair of de Havilland two-pitch propellers. Various different engines and propeller configurations were used on different variants of the aircraft, which included several models of both the Bristol Hercules and the iconic Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. Recognisable characteristics of the Wellington include the high aspect ratio of its tapered wing, the depth of its fuselage, and the use of a tall single vertical stabiliser on its tail unit, which reportedly aided in recognition of the type. The Wellington typically had a crew of five. The bomb-aimer was located within the aircraft's nose. The Wellington could be fitted with dual flight controls, and specialised dual- control conversion sets were developed for the purpose of performing training upon the type. The cockpit also contained provisions for heating and de-icing equipment, which was introduced on later models of the Wellington. The Wellington Mk I had a maximum offensive bomb load of , more than one-fifth of the overall aircraft's all-up weight. Additional munitions and an expanded bombing capacity were a recurring change made in many of the subsequent variants of the Wellington developed during the war, including the carrying of ever-larger bombs. A crew member inside rear of Wellington fuselage Defensive armaments comprised the forward and tail turret gun positions, along with a retractable revolving ventral turret. Due to the high cruising speeds of the Wellington, it had been realised that fully enclosed turrets, as opposed to semi-enclosed or exposed turrets, would be necessary; the turrets were also power-operated in order to traverse with the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to keep up with the new generations of opposing fighter aircraft. Due to the specialised nature of increasingly advanced turrets, these were treated as ancillary equipment, being designed and supplied independently and replacing Vickers' own turrets developed for the aircraft. The turrets initially used a Nash & Thompson control unit, while each position was equipped with a pair of .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. On many Wellington variants, the Vickers-built ventral turret of the Mk I was replaced by a Nash & Thompson-built counterpart as standard. A key innovation of the Wellington was its geodesic construction, devised by aircraft designer and inventor Barnes Wallis. The fuselage was built from 1,650 elements, consisting of duralumin W-beams which formed into a metal framework. Wooden battens were screwed to the beams and were covered with Irish linen; the linen, treated with layers of dope, formed the outer skin of the aircraft. The construction proved to be compatible with significant adaptations and alterations including greater all-up weight, larger bombs, tropicalisation, and the addition of long-range fuel tanks. Close up of a surviving Vickers Wellington bomber showing its geodesic airframe The metal lattice gave the structure considerable strength, with any single stringer able to support a portion of load from the opposite side of the aircraft. Heavily damaged or destroyed beams on one side could still leave the aircraft structure viable; as a result, Wellingtons with huge areas of framework missing were often able to return home when other types would not have survived, leading to stories of the aircraft's 'invulnerability'.Andrews 1967, p. 5. The effect was enhanced by the fabric skin occasionally burning off leaving the naked frames exposed. A further advantage of the geodesic construction of the wings was its enabling of a unique method for housing the fuel, with each wing containing three fuel tanks within the unobstructed space provided between the front and rear spars outboard of the engines. A disadvantage of the geodesic fuselage structure was its insufficient lengthwise stiffness: when fitted with attachment for towing cargo gliders, its structure \\"gave\\" and stretched slightly. So, while the airframe continued to be structurally sound, the forces in the long control runs of cables and push-pull rods to the empennage grew considerably, affecting controllability of the aeroplane. This is the reported reason why Wellingtons (and Warwicks for that matter) were not used as glider tugs. Operational history magnetic field generator to detonate naval mines at Ismailia, Egypt On 3 September 1939, the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 3 Group of Bomber Command comprised eight squadrons (No. 9, No. 37, No. 37 No. 38, No. 99, No. 115 and No. 149 Squadrons), alongside two reserve squadrons (No. 214 and No. 215 squadrons), that were equipped with a mixture of Wellington Mk I and Mk IA aircraft. On 4 September 1939, less than 24 hours after the commencement of hostility, a total of 14 Wellingtons of No. 9 and No. 149 Squadrons, alongside a number of Bristol Blenheim aircraft, performed the first RAF bombing raid of the war, targeting German shipping at Brunsb√ºttel. The bombing of the harbour itself had not been permitted by the Chamberlain War Cabinet for fear of injuring civilians. The effectiveness of the raid was diminished by a combination of poor weather and high amounts of anti-aircraft fire. During this opening raid, a pair of Wellingtons became the first aircraft to be lost on the Western Front. On 3 December 1939, 24 Wellingtons of No. 38, No. 115 and No. 147 Squadrons attacked the German fleet moored at Heligoland. The bombing commenced from high altitude and, while results of the bombing itself proved negligible in terms of damage, the ability of a formation of Wellingtons to adequately penetrate strongly defended hostile airspace was validated. On 14 December 1939, 12 Wellingtons of No. 99 Squadron conducted a low-level raid upon German shipping at the Schillig Roads and Wilhelmshaven. Encountering enemy fire from warships, flak, and Luftwaffe aircraft, the Wellington formation lost five aircraft, along with another that crashed near its base, while only one enemy fighter was downed.Andrews 1967, pp. 13, 14. On 18 December 1939, 24 Wellingtons of No. 9, No. 37 and No. 149 Squadrons participated in the Battle of the Heligoland Bight against the German fleet and naval bases in both the Schillig Roads and Wilhelmshaven. The Wellingtons were unable to deploy their bombs as all vessels were in harbour, thus restrictions on endangering civilians prevented their engagement. Having been alerted by radar, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft intercepted the incoming bombers near to Heligoland and continuously attacked the formation much of the way home. In total, 12 of the bombers were destroyed and a further three were badly damaged. Defensive fire from the turrets downed four aircraft.Andrews 1967, p. 14. Wellington GR Mk XIII showing anti- submarine radar masts The action at Heligoland highlighted the Wellington's vulnerability to attacking fighters, possessing neither self-sealing fuel tanks nor sufficient defensive armament. In particular, while the nose and tail turrets protected against attacks from the front and rear, the Wellington had no defences against attacks from the beam and above, as it had not been believed that such attacks were possible owing to the high speed of aircraft involved.Richards 1953, p. 46. As a consequence of the losses taken, the tactic of unescorted day bombing was abandoned, and Bomber Command decided to use the Wellington force to attack German communications and industrial targets instead. Vickers Wellingtons of 9 Squadron, on a mission in WW2, flying in formation.Another key decision made was to switch the Wellington to night operations; on 25 August 1940, the type participated in the first night raid on Berlin. During the First 1,000 bomber raid, on Cologne, conducted on 30 May 1942, 599 out of 1,046 RAF aircraft dispatched were Wellingtons; of these, 101 were flown by Polish aircrews. During operations under Bomber Command, Wellingtons flew a total of 47,409 operations, dropped 41,823 tons (37,941 tonnes) of bombs and lost 1,332 aircraft in action. In one high- profile incident, a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 night-fighter attacked a Wellington returning from an attack on M√ºnster, causing a fire at the rear of the starboard engine. The second pilot, Sergeant James Allen Ward (RNZAF) climbed out of the fuselage, kicked holes in the doped fabric of the wing for foot and hand holds to reach the starboard engine and smothered the burning upper wing covering. He and the aircraft returned home safely and Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross.Richards 1995, p. 115. The Wellington was also adopted by Coastal Command, in which it contributed to the Battle of the Atlantic. It was used to carry out anti-submarine duties; on 6 July 1942, a Wellington sank its first enemy vessel. Specialised variants, fitted with a 48 ft (14.63 m) diameter metal hoop, were used for exploding enemy mines by generating a powerful magnetic field as it passed over them. In 1944, Wellingtons of Coastal Command were deployed to Greece and performed various support duties during the British intervention in the Greek Civil War. A few Wellingtons were operated by the Hellenic Air Force. A captured Wellington Mk.IC L7842 in Luftwaffe service, probably at Rechlin-L√§rz Airfield, circa 1941 While the Wellington was superseded in the European Theatre, it remained in operational service for much of the war in the Middle East and in 1942, Wellingtons based in India became the RAF's first long-range bomber operating in the Far East. It was particularly effective with the South African Air Force in North Africa. The Wellington also served in anti-submarine duties with 26 Squadron SAAF based in Takoradi, Gold Coast (now Ghana). In late 1944, a radar-equipped Wellington XIV from 407 Sqn. RCAF was modified for use by the RAF's Fighter Interception Unit as what would now be described as an airborne early warning and control aircraft.Jackson 2007, p. 217. It operated at an altitude of over the North Sea to control a de Havilland Mosquito and a Bristol Beaufighter fighter intercepting Heinkel He 111 bombers flying from Dutch airbases and carrying out airborne launches of the V-1 flying bomb. The FIU operators on the Wellington would search for the He 111 aircraft climbing to launch altitude, then direct the Beaufighter to the bomber, while the Mosquito would attempt to intercept the V-1 if launched.R.H.

Total built A total number of 11,461 aircraft is most often quoted, notably by Andrews & Morgan (1988); however, they appear to have totalled incorrectly as, using their own data, the total is 11,462. There is some question over several individual aircraft, so the actual total may be a few either side of this figure. In combination, the Wellingtons and 846 Warwicks represent over 75% of the total number of aircraft built by the Vickers-Armstrongs company.Murray, 2012, p. 39.

Retrieved: 13 January 2008. Some other substantial parts also survive. * Wellington IA serial number N2980 is owned by Brooklands Museum at Brooklands, Surrey. Built at Brooklands and first flown in November 1939, this aircraft took part in the RAF's daylight bombing raids on Germany early in the Second World War but later lost power during a training flight on 31 December 1940 and ditched in Loch Ness. All the occupants survived except the rear gunner, who was killed when his parachute failed to open. The aircraft was recovered from the bottom of Loch Ness in September 1985 and restored in the late 1980s and 1990s. A new Wellington exhibition featuring N2980 was officially opened by Robin Holmes (who led the recovery team), Penelope Keith (as trustee of Brooklands Museum), Norman Parker (who worked for Vickers) and Ken Wallis (who flew Wellingtons operationally) on 15 June 2011, the 75th anniversary of the first flight of the type's effective prototype in 1936. On 15 September 2016, after having its outer wings removed the day before, N2980 was towed from the Bellman hangar in which it was restored and where it had been displayed for nearly 30 years. This move was the first time that 'R' for 'Robert' had moved on its undercarriage since its last flight in 1940. The aircraft was exhibited in a temporary building while the Bellman hangar was relocated and restored until taken off display and moved back into the latter building on 25 July 2017. The aeroplane is the centre-piece of the 'Brooklands Aircraft Factory' exhibition about the aircraft industry at Brooklands, which was formally opened on 13 November 2017. Vickers Wellington T.10 serial number MF628 undergoing restoration * Wellington T.10 serial number MF628 is held by the Royal Air Force Museum. It was delivered to RAF No.18 MU (Maintenance Unit) for storage at RAF Tinwald Downs, Dumfries, as a Wellington B.X, on 11 May 1944. In March 1948 the front gun turret was removed in its conversion to a T.10 for its role as a postwar aircrew trainer. This aircraft is the Wellington seen taking off in The Dam Busters and was also used for some air-to-air photography on the movie. This aircraft made the last flight of a Wellington, from Aston Down to Wisley, in January 1955. The RAF Museum later refitted the front gun turret in keeping with its original build as a B.X (wartime mark numbers used Roman numerals, Arabic numerals were adopted postwar).\\"Vickers Wellington X.\\" Royal Air Force Museum.

It is part of the Back Mountain, a 118 square mile region in northern Luzerne County. The population was 2,049 at the 2010 census. History A steamboat on Harveys Lake (ca 1910) The first white man who lived in modern-day Lake Township was Matthew Scouten (in the 1790s). Hollenback & Urquhart would later own much of the territory. They were responsible for building the first sawmill in 1839 and the first gristmill in 1840. Every mill belonging to Hollenback & Urquhart was later transferred over to the Hoffman Lumber Company. At the time, due to the abundance of trees, the lumber industry was one of the major employers in the region.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/laketwp.htm Lake Township was formed in 1841 from territory taken from Lehman and Monroe Townships. It was named after Harveys Lake, which was originally part of the township. In 1842, Wyoming County was formed and the county line cut off a portion of Lake Township, which was given back to Monroe Township (now in Wyoming County).http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/laketwp.htm The Harveys Lake and Towanda Branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed in the late 1800s. It ran directly from Wilkes-Barre to Harveys Lake. In the 1890s, railroad lines were constructed from the lake to the communities of Pittston and Towanda. Harveys Lake became a major tourist destination in the township. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s. During the same time period, there were three hotels, two hundred cottages, sixty boathouses, and four steamboats on Harveys Lake. The steamers were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were commonplace between 1900 and 1920. In 1968, Lake Township lost its major tourist attraction ‚Äî Harveys Lake. The region around the lake broke away from the township and was incorporated as a borough. Today, the township is made up of thick forests and farmland. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and 0.07% is water. Pikes Creek is a village in Lake Township. PA 29 runs north to south through the center of the municipality. PA 118 travels east to west through the southernmost portion of the township. The northwestern portion is made up of mountains and thick forests. The eastern and southern sections of the township are made up of hills, forests, and farms. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,110 people, 800 households, and 588 families residing in the township. The population density was 78.2 people per square mile (30.2/km2). There were 865 housing units at an average density of 32.1/sq mi (12.4/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 99.19% White, 0.19% Native American, 0.14% Asian, 0.14% Pacific Islander, 0.14% from other races, and 0.19% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.19% of the population. There were 800 households, out of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.4% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.4% were non-families. 21.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 and the average family size was 3.01. In the township the population was spread out, with 23.6% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.9 males. The median income for a household in the township was $40,051, and the median income for a family was $43,636. Males had a median income of $32,500 versus $23,512 for females. The per capita income for the township was $16,641. About 9.5% of families and 11.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.8% of those under age 18 and 12.6% of those age 65 or over.

Early life Robarts was born in Banff, Alberta, making him the only Ontario premier not to have been born in Ontario. As a young man, he moved to London, Ontario, with his family, where he studied at Central Collegiate (today, London Central Secondary School) and at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) in business administration. While attending UWO, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.Delta Upsilon UWO alumni Robarts enrolled to study law at Osgoode Hall Law School, but his education was interrupted by service with the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He served as an officer on . After the war, he returned to law school and graduated in 1948. Early political career Robarts practiced law in London, Ontario, and was elected to city council in 1948. In 1951, he was elected as a member of provincial parliament (MPP) to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, as a Progressive Conservative (PC) from the city. In that era, MPPs not in cabinet were essentially working part-time due to relatively light legislative duties. Robarts commuted by train from the Queen's Park legislature in Toronto‚Äìthe provincial capital‚Äìto his family and law practice in London, effectively combining his legislative work with his legal career. His wife Norah disliked Toronto and remained at home in London for most of their marriage. The couple raised two children.Robarts, by A.K. McDougall, 1985 He entered the cabinet of Leslie Frost in 1958 as minister without portfolio, and was promoted to minister of education in 1959. The province was in the midst of a major building phase with its education system, to accommodate an enormous increase in enrollment following the Baby Boomer generation of the post-World War II era, and Robarts played an important role as education minister, with the establishment of new institutions such as York University. Premier of Ontario In 1961, Robarts became the 17th premier of Ontario, and served in that capacity until 1971. He was an advocate of individual freedoms, and promoted the rights of the provinces against the centralizing initiatives of the federal government. He also promoted national unity against Quebec separatism, and hosted the 1967 \\"Confederation of Tomorrow\\" conference in Toronto in an unsuccessful attempt to achieve an agreement for a new Constitution of Canada. He initially opposed Canadian Medicare when it was proposed, but later endorsed it fully following New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Kenneth Bolton's upset by-election victory on the issue in the London-area riding of Middlesex South. As a civil libertarian, and a strong believer in the promotion of both official languages, Robarts opened the door to French language education in Ontario schools.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,465, making it the third largest city in Luzerne County. It occupies 3.5 square miles of land. The city can be divided into several sections: Honey Pot (northwestern Nanticoke), Downtown (northern and central Nanticoke), and Hanover Section (southeastern Nanticoke). It was once an active coal mining community. Today, the 167-acre main campus of Luzerne County Community College is located within the city. History 1858 anthracite map; Nanticoke can be seen on the far left Early history The name Nanticoke was derived from Nentego (\\"tidewater people\\"), an Algonquian- speaking Native American people who moved to the Wyoming Valley when their Maryland lands were spoiled for hunting by the European settlers.Pritzker, pp. 440 For quite some time, the tribe maintained a village in the valley before Europeans settled there. The nearby Nanticoke Creek, also named after the tribe, was once known as Muddy Run. However, its current name was appearing on maps as early as 1776. The creek has also historically been referred to by many other names, including Lee's Creek, Miller's Creek, Robbins Creek, Bobbs Creek, Rummage Creek, and Warrior Run Creek. All of these names were described as erroneous in Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. A forge was constructed on Nanticoke Creek in 1778 by Mason F. Alden and John Alden. During that same year, a log gristmill was also built near the creek by a Mr. Chapman. The mill was heavily guarded in 1780. By 1793, a sawmill and gristmill both existed on the creek. Incorporation An old postcard of Main Street In the 19th century, Nanticoke was carved out of Hanover Township and Newport Township. The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1830; Nanticoke was chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature as a borough on January 31, 1874. Nanticoke experienced its greatest population increase between 1917 and 1925. This allowed for it to qualify as a third class city. The citizens voted in the fall of 1924 to form a city government; and elections were held the following year. The new city government consisted of a mayor and several councilmen, who took office in January 1926 (which was the official date of becoming a third class city). The first mayor of Nanticoke City was Dan Sakowski. Post-incorporation Samuel H. Kress opened his first store, which grew into the national S. H. Kress & Co. chain, in Nanticoke. The city gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as an active anthracite coal mining community, drawing a large portion of its labor force from European immigrants. At its peak, in the 1930s, the city was home to over 27,000 people. However, when the mining industry in the region collapsed, Nanticoke witnessed urban decay and a shrinking population. The collapse of the mining industry also left behind a scarred landscape ‚Äì abandoned mines, breakers, buildings, and an impaired creek due to mine drainage. Concrete City, built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's coal division in 1911, is located near the Hanover Section of Nanticoke. Abandoned since 1924, it was designated as an historic site in 1998, and its remnants still stand as a tourist attraction. The original entrance has since been bulldozed. However, there is an alternate route that does not appear on maps; it can be found at the end of Bliss & Mosier Streets. In 1967, Luzerne County Community College, a two-year community college, was established in the city. Today, the main campus covers roughly 167 acres in Nanticoke. The school also maintains eleven satellite learning centers located throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania. Nanticoke City officials voted unanimously to apply for Act 47, or economically distressed city status, which was granted by the state in 2006. Nanticoke faced a projected $700,000 deficit that year, with revenues flat and falling far behind expenses.

As of 2010, the population was 5,374. Newport is located on the outskirts of Nanticoke City. History=Establishment An old map of Newport Township Newport was incorporated as a township in 1790. It is one of the original townships in Luzerne County. The municipality derives its name from Newport, Rhode Island. The first settlement in modern-day Newport Township was established by Major Prince Alden in 1772. A few years later, his sons (Mason and John) erected a forge on Nanticoke Creek. One of the first stores in the territory was established by Jacob Ramback; it was constructed on a road between Wanamie and Nanticoke.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/newport.htm Due to the growing coal mining industry in the Wyoming Valley (in the 19th century), farmers were selling large tracts of land to the coal companies. Even sawmills and gristmills were replaced by coal mines. Alden, Glen Lyon, and Wanamie were just a few of the mining villages in the township. Mine shafts and collieries were constructed throughout the territory.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/newport.htm Boom and bust At the beginning of the 20th century, Luzerne County was in the midst of an economic boom. Industry, which included manufacturing and coal mining, drew thousands of immigrants (mostly from Europe) to the region. By the mid-20th century, anthracite production was declining at a fairly steady rate. Consumers were gradually switching from coal to other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and electricity).Healey, Richard (2005) \\"The Breakers of the Northern Anthracite Coalfield of Pennsylvania\\", 'Vol. 1, Major breakers prior to 1902'.

On January 22, 1959, the Susquehanna River broke through the River Slope Mine in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township. The incident claimed twelve lives. In the following months, two of the area's largest coal companies announced a full withdrawal from the anthracite business. Thousands of jobs were lost and the mining industry never recovered in Luzerne County. Contemporary history St. Stanislaus Institute, also known as St. Stanislaus Orphanage and Holy Child Church, was built between 1918 and 1939. The facility served as a Catholic orphanage until it closed in 1972. St. Stanislaus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. In 1986, State Correctional Institute at Retreat opened in northwestern Newport Township. It is a medium security correctional facility for men.
