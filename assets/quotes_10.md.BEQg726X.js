He made his first- class debut for Nottinghamshire in June 1913 against Yorkshire, when he took 2 wickets in the first innings, but never had the chance to bat. He managed three no balls and two wides in the match. In his second match against Hampshire he was stumped for a duck, took no wickets, and bowled four wides.

Burroughs characterizes the Waziri as the greatest warriors in Africa, though small in numbers. They are feared by Arabic ivory and slave traders as well as cannibal tribes, and known from western to eastern Africa. The Waziri also appear in other media based on the novels. Origin of the name According to David Arthur Adams, Burroughs may have coined the name \\"Waziri\\" on the basis of two historical African groups: \\"The infamous slaver, Tippu-Tib, who accompanied Henry Morton Stanley upon part of his journey, employed the Wangwana (the name of the inhabitants of Uganda) and Wanyamwizi (from Tanzania) to help round up slaves. The name Waziri could very likely be one of ERB's name juxtapositions, and, again, the reversal of alliances would be a normal practice in his writing.\\"Adams, David Arthur. \\"Some Thoughts About The Return of Tarzan\\" in ERBzine Magazine #0666 Burroughs was frequently using Stanley's writings as a source for his early Tarzan novels. The Waziri as portrayed by Burroughs =In West Africa= In The Return of Tarzan Tarzan returns from civilization to his beloved jungle. But he has changed. Previously his relationship with natives was violent and antagonistic, colored by the death of his ape foster mother Kala at the hands of a native hunter, but he has experienced humanity in all its varieties since then. So now, when he meets a black warrior, instead of killing him he saves him from Numa, the lion.The Return of Tarzan chapter 14. The warrior, Busuli, is a member of the Waziri tribe. Tarzan discovers they are cultured and despise cannibals like the tribe he had intermittently warred against in his youth. Tarzan is accepted as a member of the tribe after teaching them a new practical way of hunting elephants. These two hunts are the only recorded instances of his killing \\"Tantor\\", the elephant.Tarzan Alive page 89. When Arabic ivory traders and their cannibal slaves attack the Waziri village, causing the death of the old chief (also named Waziri) and many others, Tarzan takes the lead, preventing the burning of the village and defeating the Arabs with effective guerrilla-tactics by killing them one at a time. Tarzan then becomes the new chief of the tribe and from then on these noble black warriors share his fate. The Waziri take him to their secret treasure-trove, the lost city of Opar, which they first discovered in the days of the deceased former chief Chowambi, Waziri's father. Tarzan leaves Africa and the Waziri for England at the end of The Return of Tarzan, seemingly forever. But by the time of the next book in which he appears, the non-Tarzan novel The Eternal Lover, he has established a plantation in Uziri, the land of the Waziri, on which he and his wife Jane reside part-time, and where they entertain guests. According to the map that shows Africa as Burroughs imagined it, the Waziri village was somewhere in Angola. The Waziri are mentioned but do not appear in the next Tarzan book, The Beasts of Tarzan. However, during the adventure Tarzan meets a native warrior, Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi, whom he invites to join the Waziri at the conclusion. He is subsequently shown to have done so. In The Son of Tarzan the Waziri appear as mostly anonymous native followers of Tarzan, and are not named as a tribe. One of their number, Muviri, is presumably the same character as the Muviro of later books. =In transition= While Burroughs does not recount the event, it is evident that at some point between The Beasts of Tarzan (in which the Waziri country of Uziri is last mentioned), and Tarzan the Untamed the tribe moves with Tarzan to a new plantation located east of Lake Victoria in British East Africa (now known as Kenya). The relocation likely takes place between the intervening books, The Son of Tarzan and Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar. As the protagonist of Son enters Africa near the west coast, \\"a little below the equator,\\" the plantation shown therein is presumably the original one. In Jewels, the plantation's proximity to the Belgian Congo is compatible with either location, but the intervention of Abyssinian soldiers from the north appears to indicate an east African setting. The prominent presence in both books of Arab raiders from the east African coast does not fix the setting, as historically these ranged widely through south central Africa, and indeed attack the Waziri in their original country as early as The Return of Tarzan. =In East Africa= By the time of Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar, Basuli (presumably the Busuli of Return) is chieftain of the tribe under Tarzan, with Mugambi from Beasts shown as a prominent warrior. The organization of the Waziri has changed from tribal to a more feudal system. They live with Tarzan and Jane in their plantation, with members taking care of cooking and cleaning, and even Jane's rose garden.Gone primitive page 57. They no longer call Tarzan \\"King of Waziri,\\" but rather \\"Big Bwana,\\" while he calls them his \\"children\\": \\"...and were the heart of the Big Bwana not filled with love for his black children\\".Burroughs, Edgar Rice. Tarzan and the Golden Lion, chapter 5 The Waziri suffer a major reverse in Jewels when a large number of their young men accompany Tarzan on an expedition to recover more wealth from Opar; in their absence, most of the warriors left behind to protect the estate are slaughtered in an Arab raid, and the plantation burned. A few of those on the expedition also perish. The plantation is reconstructed at the end of the book. By the time of Tarzan the Untamed the estate and the Waziri are definitely in East Africa, and once again the former is destroyed and the latter slaughtered, this time by German- led raiders from Tanganyika in the opening days of World War I. Among the Waziri perishing in the raid is the warrior Wasimbu, son of Muviro, who is crucified, and presumably also Basuli and Mugambi, as they are absent from this and all later novels. By the time of Tarzan and the Golden Lion the survivors of the Waziri under \\"Old Muviro\\" have reconstructed the main bungalow and other buildings destroyed in the war. Another survivor is Usula, who is revealed to have gone to London in his boyhood as a servant to Tarzan; he has learned fluent English as a result. Usula reappears in the following novel, Tarzan and the Ant Men. In later novels, beginning with Tarzan and the Lost Empire, Muviro is portrayed as sub-chief of the Waziri under Tarzan.Burroughs, Edgar Rice. Tarzan and the Lost Empire, chapter 1: \\"'Something is coming, Bwana,' said Muviro, sub-chief of the Waziri.\\" He and his warriors feature sporadically in subsequent books. They accompany Tarzan to the subterranean realm of Pellucidar in Tarzan at the Earth's Core, and appear its non-Tarzan sequel, Back to the Stone Age. They also turn up in Tarzan the Invincible, Tarzan Triumphant, and Tarzan's Quest, in which Muviro's search for his lost daughter Buira forms an important sub-plot to the main action, as well as Tarzan the Magnificent, in which another warrior, Waranji, is named, and the short story \\"Tarzan and the Champion,\\" which forms part of the collection Tarzan and the Castaways. =Waziri named in the novels= * Chowambi, chief of the tribe before Waziri, his son. * Waziri, chief of the tribe in succession to Chowambi, his father. Evidently each chief takes the name of the tribe as his own. (Tarzan, Waziri's successor, is also initially called \\"Waziri\\" by his tribesmen.) Presumably the title is used only for the current chief, previous chiefs, like Chowambi, being referred to by their original personal names on decease. The personal name of this \\"Waziri\\" is not given in the novels. * Tarzan, chief of the tribe in succession to Waziri after the latter's decease. Also known initially as Waziri. * Busuli, a Waziri warrior who introduces Tarzan to the tribe. Later subchief under Tarzan, assuming he is the same as \\"Basuli,\\" who appears in that role. Basuli presumably died in the German raid on the Greystoke plantation during World War I. * Mugambi, originally chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi tribe; on Tarzan's invitation he joined the Waziri as a warrior. Mugambi presumably died in the German raid on the Greystoke plantation during World War I. * Muviro, an aged Waziri warrior who knew Tarzan \\"in the old days,\\" assuming he is the same as \\"Muviri,\\" who is introduced in that role. Later subchief under Tarzan in succession to Basuli. Father of Wasimbu and Buira. * Wasimbu, a Waziri warrior who was crucified to death by the Germans who raided the Greystoke plantation during World War I. Son of Muviro. * Usula, a Waziri who went to London in his youth as a servant to Tarzan, who as a result learned fluent English. Later returned to Africa and served on the Greystoke plantation. * Buira, a Waziri woman, daughter of Muviro, who went missing and was searched for by her father. * Waranji, a Waziri warrior. The Waziri in other media The Waziri are featured in Tarzan comic books and comic strips in a role identical to their portrayal in Burrough's Tarzan books. In other media, their portrayal varies. In the 1952 movie Tarzan's Savage Fury, which incorporates some elements from The Return of Tarzan, the Waziri (here called the Wazuri) are a tribe Tarzan's father had ministered to as a missionary before dying and leaving Tarzan an orphan. The villainous Rokov tricks Tarzan and Jane into leading him to the tribe, scheming to rob it of its vast treasure of diamonds. In the 1998 movie Tarzan and the Lost City, incorporating elements from Return and from The Beasts of Tarzan, Mugambi appears under the alternate spelling Mugambe as a witch doctor. He warns Tarzan, apparently by telepathy, of an expedition by treasure hunters seeking the lost city of Opar that is laying waste to Tarzan's homeland. In the 2001 Disney series of animated cartoons The Legend of Tarzan, the Waziri are a forest tribe friendly but not subordinate to Tarzan, studied by Jane's father Archimedes Q. Porter and Irish anthropologist Robin Doyle. The tribe is led by Chief Keewazi, functionally identical to Chief Waziri in The Return of Tarzan; the novels' Basuli appears as his headstrong son, being groomed to be the next chief, and Muviro as a villainous Waziri warrior jealous of Basuli and hostile to outsiders. Muviro attempts to kill both Basuli and Tarzan so that he himself will be the next chief, but his treachery is exposed and he is banished from the tribe. The tribe as a whole is menaced on one occasion by toxic wastewater from an illegal mining operation. Oddly, Queen La of Opar is portrayed as a former Waziri. In the 2016 movie The Legend of Tarzan, the Waziri are recast as the Kuba, a tribe the young Jane Porter's father had served as a missionary, and to which she had brought the severely injured Tarzan after he had saved her from an ape attack. The Kuba ribal name presumably derives from the historical Congolese Kuba Kingdom. In the film, Muviro appears as chief of the tribe and a benevolent elder, as in the novels, as well as an educated, literate man fluent in several languages. He welcomes the now married Tarzan and Jane back to the Kuba village after their long absence in England. He and other tribe members are subsequently killed in a raid by L√©on Rom and his mercenaries; several of the remaining warriors afterwards join Tarzan and his companion George Washington Williams on a quest for vengeance against Rom. The Kuba are portrayed as being as adept at jungle craft as Tarzan. In the 2016 book \\"A Natural History of Human Morality\\" Michael Tomasello uses the name to refer to a hypothetical tribe some 150'000 years ago and explains what role cultural customs would play in the evolution of objective morality.Michael Tomasello, A natural history of Human Morality, Harvard University Press, p.90 References See also *Watusi *Zulu people *Swahili people * Google Books preview: Chapter two: Taking Tarzan Seriously , * Google Books preview: * Map to Tarzan's Africa as Burroughs recalled * More detailed map to Tarzan's Africa (Art by Clifford Bird) Category:Tarzan characters Category:Africa in fiction Category:Fictional ethnic groups ","title":"Waziri (fictional tribe)"},{"id":"23110546","text":"The Baldwin Mono Tiltrotor project is a research effort into a tiltrotor aircraft that uses only one rotor.

J., Computational Drag Study for the Mono Tiltrotor Scaled Demonstrator (MTR- SD), March 2008. The three unprecedented hardware mechanisms of the MTR were demonstrated in small scale flight tests: 1) the aerodynamically deployed wing panels; 2) the pitch axis suspended cargo pod; and 3) the tilting centerline rotor. Furthermore, a diameter rotor remote control MTR Functional Demonstrator (MTR-FD) that integrates these three features was designed, built, and hover tested.http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckScript;=blogScript&plckElementId;=blogDest&plckBlogPage;=BlogViewPost&plckPostId;=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A5d1e6791-b57b-43ff-8b59-15f04ec92ea9 ‚ÄúMono Tiltrotor makes progress, on a small scale‚Äù, Aviation Week Defense Technology Blog, May 12, 2008. Bell Helicopter Textron used proprietary methods for advanced concept design and analysis to validate the rotor MTR-SD design. Bell Helicopter's assessment resulted in validations of the MTR-SD vertical lift capacity, engine power required and power available, cruise thrust and propulsive efficiency, aircraft weight, and airplane mode cruise lift. Bell Helicopter also generated and reported MTR-SD flight dynamics data. A computational fluid dynamics drag assessment was performed, and in combination with the Bell Helicopter assessment this validated MTR-SD projected drag and aircraft cruise range performance. In early 2009, a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) video was produced showing the MTR-SD performing the missions specified in the United States Marine Corps - Cargo Unmanned Aircraft System - Universal Need Statement (USMC Cargo UAS UNS)Universal Need Statement for The Cargo Unmanned Aircraft System (Cargo UAS), HQ USMC, August 27, 2008. and in the Office of Naval Research ‚Äì Cargo Unmanned Aircraft System ‚Äì Request for Information (ONR Cargo UAS RFI).http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckScript;=blogScript&plckElementId;=blogDest&plckBlogPage;=BlogViewPost&plckPostId;=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3A834278bd-47ba-48a2-ac28-3ce27639dd64 ‚ÄúVIDEO: Mono Tiltrotor as Cargo UAS‚Äù, Aviation Week Defense Technology, March 12, 2009.http://news.cnet.com/8301-13639_3-10201662-42.html ‚ÄúRobot tiltrotor boxcar may fly Navy supply missions‚Äù, CNET News, March 21, 2009.

He also flew as an exhibition and racing pilot. He flew reconnaissance missions during the battle of the Marne. Early life Brindejonc des Moulinais was born in Pl√©rin, C√¥tes-d'Armor, the son of Jean- Georges Brindejonc des Moulinais and Blanche-Marie-Am√©lie Merlin. He was educated by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, and then the college of Saint-Servan in Ille-et-Vilaine. From 1901 to 1912 he lived at \\"Le clos linden\\" at 41 rue Saint-Guillaume in Pleurtuit. His summer vacations were spent mostly with his cousins at Pleurtuit Val, near where his parents owned Pontouraude. In 1910 he attended the University of Rennes. Aviation career Marcel Brindejonc des Moulinais c. 1910 His interest in flying started at Dinan and Dinard during the summer of 1909. In December 1910 he bought an aircraft from Alberto Santos-Dumont, and then enrolled at a flying school at Pau, gaining his pilot's license (No. 448) on 13 March 1911.Ae.C.F. Pilot Aviators Flight 9 Aug 1911 In June, he participated in the meeting at Abbeville in a Bl√©riot monoplane. He then bought a Morane-Borel monoplane and started entering flying competitions, participating in exhibitions in Pau, Toulouse, Carcassonne, Perpignan, and Foix. In July, he returned to Paris, and was given a job as a pilot by Morane. The same month he was injured when he made a forced landing in a stoneyard at Billancourt.Accident to a Morane pilot Flight 22 July 1911 This accident prevented him from taking part in the 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race. He quickly became a well known pilot, appearing at the Aude) aviation meeting in February 1912. In June 1912 he took part in the competition for the grand prize of the Aero-Club de France): seven circuits between Angers, Cholet and Saumur, a total of (1,1002 km): three laps to be made on the first day and the rest on the second day. Owing to poor weather few pilots attempted to take off on the first day. Garros was the only competitor to finish the necessary three laps. Brindejonc was the only other pilot to complete the second lap; although he did complete the third lap, his arrival at 7,34 was too late to qualify by four minutes. On the second day a Garros completed the four laps necessary to secure the main prize, while a three-lap race was held for all the remaining pilots, in which Brindejonc finished third. On 8 August 1912, he made an unsuccessful attempt to win the Pommery cup with a flight from Paris to Berlin. A mechanical failure in Westphalia stopped him. 1913 was his most successful year. His trip from Paris to London, Brussels and returning to Paris (1,040 km 650 mi) in a Morane- Saulnier C monoplane, with double crossing of the Channel) took place between 25 and 27 February 1913. During his tour Paris‚ÄìBordeaux‚ÄìBurgos‚ÄìMadrid‚ÄìBarcelona to Perpignan Lyon Paris from 24 March to 12 April 1913, weather conditions were harsh: \\"What a terrible trip! How I suffered! One can not imagine!\\" he wrote. The Pommery Cup was awarded twice a year (on April 30 and October 31) between 1909 and 1913 to the aviator who traveled the greatest distance in one day. Brindejonc des Moulinais made several unsuccessful attempts to win in 1912 and 1913: Paris‚ÄìBerlin on 8 August 1912, Berlin‚ÄìVillacoublay on 18 October 1912, attempted the impossible after the blessing of Morane-Saulnier at Villacoublay by the Bishop of Versailles on 22 October 1912, Paris‚ÄìM√ºnster on 29 April 1913, Bremen‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìLondon from 9 to 11 May 1913. The last flight caused trouble for Brindejonc, since he flew over London on his approach to Hendon. As a result, he became the first person to be prosecuted under the 1913 Aerial Navigation Act. Maurice Guillaux, a previous winner of the Pommery Cup, Flight 7 June 1913 p 629 had claimed to have covered 1,386 km on 23 August 1913, this distance was not ratified after Brindejonc de Moulinais appealed: the claim was the result of a mistake over where he had landed. Guillaux was banned from flying in the competition for ten years. Flight 15 November 1913 page 1258 Marcel Brindejonc won the cup with a flight made on 10 June 1913 of 1,382. kmBrindejonc secures Pommery Cup Flight 15 November 1913 (distance approved at a speed of 170 km) in a Morane-Saulnier H monoplane leaving Paris Villacoublay at 3.37 and arriving in Warsaw 14 hr 18 min later. From Poland, he continued, making a circuit of the capitals of Northern Europe of just over 4,800&km; (3,000 mi) between 10 June and 2 July 1913: to Dwinsk on 15 June, Saint Petersburg on 17 June, Reval (23 June) - Stockholm (25 June) - Copenhagen (29 June) - The Hague (1 July) and arriving back at Paris on 2 July. To cross the 300 km of the Baltic Sea, eight destroyers from the Russian navy were placed every eighteen miles between the island and the Swedish capital. The reception was everywhere triumphant. The ovation was outstanding Villacoublay, where he arrived a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, escorted by three aircraft flown by colleagues.Brindejonc des Moulinais's Return to Paris Flight 5 Jul 1913 He was received at City Hall from Paris. Newspapers around the world praised the courage of the young Breton. Many letters of congratulation were simply addressed to \\"Brindejonc des Moulinais, France\\". In April 1914 he competed in the Monaco Aerial Rally, in which contestants had to complete any of seven approved routes to Monaco, each including a leg by floatplane between 1 and 15 April. Brindejonc started from Madrid on 2 April, reaching Marseilles that evening, completing the course the following morning. His time for the course was 16 hrs. 2 mins. 28 secs. On 5 April he set off from Monaco for Genoa Awards thumb *Legion of Honour, awarded on 11 August 1913, becoming (at 21) the youngest holder of the honour. *The gold medal of the Aero-Club de France, awarded on 3 July 1913. * The Medal of the Academy of Sport, awarded on 23 December 1913. *The Order of Sainte-Anne, He had been decorated at Saint Petersburg (by the Grand Duke Alexander) *The Order of Gustav Vasa Stockholm *The Order of Daneborg Copenhagen (30 June by the king of Denmark. On 20 July 1913 he won the match against Mauritius and Edmond Audemars Guillaux to Juvisy-sur-Orge, for the Essorprize, a speed climbing competition organized by the newspaper L'Auto. On 12 August 1913, he traveled without incident thousand kilometers from Marseilles to Dinard, through Albi and Poitiers. 1 September he flew to Dinard in Deauville and won Nantes Royan and Agen (845 km). From 27 to 29 September 1913, during the events of the Gordon-Bennett Trophy at Reims, he placed second in the altitude competition with a passenger. Military career thumb Called to perform military service, he enlisted on 10 October 1913 in the 1st aviation group at Versailles. On 10 April 1914 he was promoted to Corporal, and assigned to the 2nd aviation group, based at Lyon. On 4 August 1914 he joined Squadron DO 22 at Stenay (Meuse), flying Dorand aircraft. From August 11, he saw the advancing German armies left behind in the villages on fire. On the evening of 2 September he told General Foch, what he had seen of the march on Reims by the 3 German army under General von Hausen. His reports to the General Foch continued the following days. Qn 9 September, during the First Battle of the Marne, he reported three times that there was a gap between the German armies and Camp de Mailly. The gap allowed the successful offensive by the French. Brindejonc de Moulinais was mentioned in dispatches for his work Aircraft in the War He was promoted to Sergeant on 3 September 1914, to second lieutenant on 25 December 1914 and lieutenant on 26 December 1915. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre on 2 June 1915. After the Battle of Champagne his health became increasingly poor and he had to rest in Britain. On 28 August 1915 he became the chief pilot at the Morane-Saulnier flight school at Le Bourget. On 30 May 1916 he joined a squadron as a pilot. Shortly after his return, at dusk on 30 July 1916, both he and Maxime Lenoir were shot down. Death He was shot down on 18 August 1916 over Vadelaincourt near Verdun, and was buried in Souilly on 6 July 1922. Captain de Beauchamp, who would be killed on 10 November 1916, gave him this tribute: \\"Brindejonc is the man in the plume, the symbol light, living, the beauty, honor passing very high, over life.\\" References Further reading * Thierry Le Roy, Les Bretons and aerospace origins to 1939, PUR, Rennes, 2002. * Jean de Roumilly Gouin,a sublime Breton -Brindejonc des Moulinais, Imprimerie cornouaillaise, Quimper. *Illustrated Air War (which published the Diary of Marcel Brindejonc Moulinais). * Gilbert Broyelle, Brindejonc des Moulinais - Pioneer of Aviation 1892-1916, drawing Alain Goutal, album achieved through family archives and research by Suzanne Guidon, 1992.

In vehicle leasing, after the lease expires, the lessee either returns the vehicle to the supplier or buys it. The vehicles that are not purchased by the driver become an unwanted asset for the fleet or leasing company because of vehicle depreciation and they look to channel intermediaries to relinquish the stock on their behalf quickly and in high volumes. Remarketing can be done to trade or to consumers. Key performance indicators Key performance indicators for vehicle remarketing are the disposal price achieved, usually in reference to a trade guide price (such as CAP Clean in the UK or Black Book in Canada) and the days-to-sell, which is the number of days between end of lease and disposal of the car. Different remarketing routes targeting different customers are available and offer different options regarding these KPI. Remarketing to trade End of lease vehicles that are not purchased by the lessee have traditionally been remarketed through wholesale vehicle auctions such as Manheim Auctions, ADESA Auctions (online only), British Car Auctions or Aston Barclay in the UK. During a car dealer auction, the vehicles are typically sold to car dealerships who in turn will retail them to consumers. In the US, in 2005, 2.7 million fleet vehicles were sold through auctions. Recently, some of the major fleet owners have chosen to sell the vehicles directly to new and used car dealerships thus bypassing the auction and saving on costs associated with transportation, auction fees and idle time. The same large fleet owners have taken advantage of digital marketplaces such as Avisdirect.com to offload the vehicles at a lower per unit transaction cost and decreasing the number of days the vehicle sits idle. Remarketing to drivers and employees In a company fleet, vehicles nearing their end of lease are made available for purchase to the current driver, and to other employees of the company operating the fleet. The benefits for the fleet and for the leasing company is a reduction in days-to-sell, as vehicles remarketed that way are sold before reaching the end of lease.

The Mayor's Courts hear traffic cases, violations of city ordinances and other misdemeanors.

Mayor's Courts are not considered trial courts or courts of record and are not subject to the supervision of the Ohio Supreme Court. Mayor's Courts are not authorized to conduct jury trials. If a defendant is entitled to and desires a jury trial, then the case is transferred to the jurisdiction's trial court of limited jurisdiction (Municipal Court or County Court). There has been criticism of the courts. The majority of revenue generated from fines and court costs go to the city or village, in contrast to fines and court costs levied by the municipal court or county court. The late Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court Thomas J.

Open Communities works with current and prospective residents and local groups to promote economically and culturally diverse communities. Free services include fair and affordable housing counseling services, community education, advocacy, and organizing for welcoming communities.  History Open Communities has its roots in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. A group of young mothers in Wilmette were worried that their children were growing up in a community that lacked diversity, and they began to discuss how they could organize for change. There were no fair housing laws at that time, and housing discrimination was common. But although local housing ads often stipulated, \\"No Negroes, Orientals or Jews,\\" the women, joined by local clergy, believed that many community members shared their concerns about housing discrimination.http://open- communities.org/about/ In 1972, a fair housing conference organized by local clergy in 1972 resulted in the creation of the North Shore Interfaith Housing Council,http://www.fairhousing.com/index.cfm?method=page.display&pageid;=3659 which became the North Suburban Housing Center in 1977, then Interfaith Housing Center of the Northern Suburbs in 1986, and Open Communities in 2012.http://open-communities.org/history/  Service Programs  =Fair housing and discrimination complaints= Open Communities helps individuals who report illegal housing discrimination, predominantly the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which makes denying housing to anyone on the basis of their race, color, national origin illegal. Additionally, the law protects those with disabilities, as well as families with children. Open Communities is an operating member of the National Fair Housing Alliance. In addition to pursuing individual cases, Open Communities works to settle cases for building that systemically discriminate against seniors or people with disabilities.http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-evanston-apartment- disability- lawsuit-0216-biz-20160215-story.htmlhttp://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510647938-fair- housing-advocacy-groups-score-settlement-with-ryan-companies-over-senior- apartments =Homesharing program= The Homesharing program is a free service which matches renters with residents in need of additional income, or who desire assistance with housekeeping chores. It often benefits residents at risk of foreclosure as well as the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The program has been lauded by the Retirement Research Foundation, and has received positive press in Chicago's northern suburbs. As of June, 2015, the program had facilitated over 700 matches in the North Shore and Chicago. =Landlord-Tenant Advice= Both landlords and tenants have rights and responsibilities toward one another, their neighbors and their homes. Landlords‚Äô and tenants‚Äô rights are protected under state and local laws, which establish requirements about security deposits, heating, property maintenance, entry, and eviction.http://open-communities.org/landlord-tenant-advice/ =Housing Counseling and Foreclosure Prevention= The foreclosure crisis is one of the nation's most pressing housing issues, and Illinois continues to have one of the highest rates of foreclosure fillings. The crisis has been particularly hard on immigrants, people of color, and lower-income families who became north suburban homeowners in the last two decades. More than 14,500 homes were foreclosed in Chicago's northern suburbs between 2005 and 2013, according to an Open Communities‚Äô analysis of Woodstock Institute foreclosure filings data.http://open-communities.org/foreclosure-prevention/  Advocacy and Community Organizing  Open Communities was founded on the belief that making housing available to people of all incomes and backgrounds makes the northern suburbs a better place to live. That's why they collaborate with and build local and regional coalitions to advance fair and affordable housing programs, policies and legislation, and provide support for bricks-and-mortar housing developments that meet a wide range of local needs.http://open- communities.org/advocacy/ In 2016, Open Communities joined the #Fightfor15.http://progressillinois.com/quick- hits/content/2016/05/02/fight-15-takes-battle-living-wage-chicago-suburbs = The Justice Project = Launched in 2015 to not only commemorate Dr. King's visit to Winnetka in 1965, but to challenge our community to become even more welcoming, The Justice Project: The March Continues is a grassroots social justice movement to inspire the communities in the northern suburbs of Chicago and beyond to be welcoming, inclusive and diverse, and to offer them a framework for doing so. http://www.justiceprojectcontinues.org/ = #StandWithMuslims = Dozens of community groups, led by Open Communities and Jewish Voice for Peace, stand against the many ways in which anti-Muslim and xenophobic hatred manifests itself, including hate speech and hate crimes; institutionalized racism and state-sanctioned violence; racial and religious profiling in all its forms; and prejudice that targets refugees and immigrants of all backgrounds.http://chicagomonitor.com/2016/03/multiple-faith-based- groups-rally-in-evanston-against-islamophobia/ References External links * Official website Category:Non-profit organizations based in Illinois Category:Affordable housing advocacy organizations Category:Community-building organizations Category:Civil liberties advocacy groups in the United States Category:1968 in law Category:Winnetka, Illinois Category:Companies based in Cook County, Illinois Category:Interfaith organizations ","title":"Open Communities"},{"id":"23110668","text":"Nigel Colborn is a British TV presenter and gardening expert/writer.

The judge told the couple: \\"I see no sense of remorse. You were proud of what you did\\". Background Kendall Myers is the grandson of Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor and great-grandson of Alexander Graham Bell. He is also related to William Howard Taft through his father. He was educated at Mercersburg Academy, a private preparatory boarding school in the borough of Mercersburg in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, followed by Brown University in the city of Providence, Rhode Island, from which he graduated, and earned a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in the city of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1977, he began working for the U.S. State Department as a Contract Instructor at its Foreign Service Institute; and, for 20 years, he had been a part-time faculty member at Johns Hopkins' Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. From 2000 until his retirement in October 2007, he worked as a European analyst in the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR). Myers‚Äô State Department service was primarily in domestic positions. Myers‚Äô spouse, Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, was never employed by the U.S. Department of State. US‚ÄìUK \\"special relationship\\" controversy In November 2006, Myers created controversy by describing the \\"special relationship\\" between the United States and the United Kingdom as \\"one sided\\" and a \\"myth\\". He said that he was \\"ashamed\\" of the treatment of Prime Minister Tony Blair by US President George W. Bush. In response, then UK MP Denis MacShane said, \\"After the Republican defeat in the midterm election, every little rat who feasted during the Bush years is now leaving the ship. I would respect this gentleman, who I have never heard of, if he had had the guts to make any of these points two or five years ago.\\" The US State Department distanced itself from Myers' comments, stating, \\"He was speaking as an academic, not as a representative of the State Department.\\" Espionage charge On June 4, 2009, Myers was arrested and charged, along with his wife Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, with acting as an illegal agent of the Cuban government for nearly 30 years, with providing classified information to that government, and wire fraud. Myers' indictment Authorities said that Myers and his wife were caught by an FBI undercover operation and that they had been spying for Cuba for \\"nearly three decades.\\" Mr. Myers‚Äô arrest was the culmination of a three-year joint FBI/Department of State Diplomatic Security Service investigation. Based on general information provided by the FBI, the Diplomatic Security Service conducted a comprehensive internal investigation that resulted in the identification of Mr. Myers by Diplomatic Security as the probable Cuban agent, and ultimately led to his arrest. The authorities also said that Myers usually relied on his memory or notes for information rather than stealing documents. The couple allegedly used shortwave radio to communicate with Cuban intelligence and also were said to have met with Cuban agents in numerous locations both inside and outside the United States. Myers told undercover agents that he had spent an evening with Fidel Castro in 1995. =Alleged motive= It is alleged that the Myers' actions may not have been prompted by greed, but more by ideology. According to a \\"law enforcement official\\", they were \\"true believers\\" in the Cuban system. The United States federal affidavit quoted a diary entry by Kendall Myers as saying, \\"I can see nothing of value that has been lost by the revolution. The revolution has released enormous potential and liberated the Cuban spirit\\", and referred to Fidel Castro as \\"one of the great political leaders of our time.\\" Other entries quoted reference a comparison of health care in the United States and healthcare in Cuba, and \\"complacency about the poor\\" in the United States. =Plea= The Myerses pleaded guilty on November 20, 2009, at a hearing before Judge Reggie Walton in U.S. District Court. Myers, 72, pled guilty to a three-count criminal information charging him with conspiracy to commit espionage and two counts of wire fraud. His wife, Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, 71, pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information charging her with conspiracy to gather and transmit national defense information. As part of his plea agreement, Kendall Myers agreed to serve a life prison sentence and to cooperate fully with the United States government regarding any criminal activity and intelligence activity by him or others. As part of her plea agreement, Gwendolyn has agreed to serve a sentence of between six and seven and a half years in prison and to cooperate fully with the United States government. =Sentence= On July 16, 2010, Kendall Myers was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. His wife Gwendolyn was sentenced to a total of 81 months in prison. Myers is currently incarcerated at the federal ADX Florence supermax facility in Colorado. Reaction =United States= United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered that a damage assessment be done to investigate the extent of damage done to United States security.

She was a presenter on the long-running BBC television programme Gardeners' World. Early life and education Fowler was born in Silchester, Hampshire, and had a rural childhood. The Daily Telegraph ‚Äì Alys Fowler on Money, 4 June 2010 Her father was a doctor, and her mother ran various businesses ‚Äì she had 200 chickens and sold their eggs, trained gun dogs, and would dog-sit for Londoners. She was influenced by her mother's gardening talents and the degree of self- sufficiency it afforded the family. After leaving Bedales School in 1996, she studied at the Royal Horticultural Society, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, where she became interested in bringing a more organic and accessible aesthetic to landscape gardening. In 1998, she was awarded a Smithsonian Scholarship to study at the New York Botanical Gardens based in the Bronx. Fowler returned to the UK in 1999 to attend University College London, where, in 2002, she completed a master's degree in Society, Science and the Environment. Career Fowler began working as a journalist for Horticulture Week, and Landscape Review. In 2005, she worked for BBC Gardeners' World and Parks as a horticultural researcher. In 2006, she became Head Gardener of the BBC garden at Berryfields in Stratford-Upon-Avon, and created features at the Gardeners' World Live shows. In 2007 she published The Thrifty Gardener: How to Create a Stylish Garden for Next to Nothing. In 2008, after appearing occasionally in her Berryfields role, she became a regular presenter on Gardeners' World, and wrote a monthly blog on the programme's website.BBC ‚Äì Gardeners' World ‚Äì Presenters She was dropped by the BBC for the 2011 series, at the same time that Toby Buckland's contract as main presenter was not renewed. She is published regularly in newspapers and magazines, including The Guardian, Gardeners' World Magazine, Gardens Illustrated, Amateur Gardening, Country Living, and The Daily Mail. In New York City, in 1998, she found ways of experiencing and creating green space, such as growing plants on her apartment's fire escape, and joining a garden-making community in Manhattan's Lower East Side which reused objects found in New York's streets and dumpsters. This became an influential period and spawned the idea for her first book in 2007, The Thrifty Gardener. Filming for her BBC series, The Edible Garden ‚Äì a.k.a. A Home-Grown Life ‚Äì began in mid-2009, and the series aired on BBC 2 in April 2010. She explored community self- sustainability in the urban environment of South Birmingham. Her second book, The Edible Garden, was published in March 2010 by BBC Books to accompany the TV series. Continuing with eco-friendly gardening culture she focused on the benefits that allotments bring to the environment and those who work on them. In 2013, she presented an episode of Great British Garden Revival. She has a weekly column in The Guardian giving advice on growing vegetables, fruit and flowers.

The latter project ended after 15 month as trade with the Soviet Union came under stricter state control. In the 1920s, the firm was the nucleus of a group of metals, coal, and electrical companies employing around one million men. Its chief rival at that time was a similar trust controlled by industrialist Hugo Stinnes.

Degressive proportionality means that while the subdivisions do not each elect an equal number of members, smaller subdivisions are allocated more seats than would be allocated strictly in proportion to their population. This is an alternative to, for instance, * Each subdivision electing the same number of members (as in the US Senate), * Each subdivision electing a number of members strictly proportional to its population (as in the US House of Representatives). Degressive proportionality is intermediate between those two approaches. As a term it does not describe any one particular formula.  Uses  = Germany = Each German state has three to six seats in the Bundesrat of Germany depending on its population. This means the least populous state, Bremen (with 663,000 inhabitants), has three seats while the most populous one, North Rhine-Westphalia (with 18,058,000 inhabitants), has only six seats. = European Parliament = Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament uses a system of degressive proportionality to allocate its 750 seats among the member states of the European Union. Treaty negotiations, rather than a specific formula, determine the apportionment between member states.  Minimum seats  U.S. electoral college vote for the 50 states and Washington D.C., based on 2010 census. States are ordered from left to right according to total state population. Any system that reserves a minimum number of seats for a sub-body is to some extent degressively proportional. One example is the election of the US presidential Electoral College. As each state has a minimum of three members of the college, voters in smaller states have disproportionally more say in the election than the national average. Like the US Electoral College, Spain's Congress of Deputies adds two extra seats to the otherwise proportional number allocated to each Province.  Advantages  * There may be a real or perceived danger that one or more of the largest subdivisions will dominate the legislature. That danger reduces if the votes of these subdivisions are reduced. * The smallest subdivisions, especially those on the periphery of the territory, may have significantly different interests from many of the other subdivisions. There is a danger that these interests will be ignored if they have a tiny number of representatives. That danger reduces if their representation is increased. * More pragmatically, the smallest subdivisions may be in a position to cause disproportionate trouble for the whole territory, for example by threatening to secede. That danger reduces if they are seen to be well-represented in the legislature. Disadvantages Many of the advantages listed above would also apply to certain smaller areas that are not recognised as separate subdivisions for electoral purposes. (It may have happened as an accident of history or as a result of gerrymandering.) It is unfair if they are not accorded the same treatment as areas that are recognised electorally as separate subdivisions.

It has wide distribution, and can be found near the shore on rocks or walls. Calos in Greek means nice, placa in Greek is shield. Caloplaca therefore means ‚Äòbeautiful patches‚Äô. Taxonomy Synonyms are Caloplaca marina f. flavogranulata Wedd., (1875); Caloplaca marina var. flavogranulata (Wedd.) Zahlbr; Gasparrinia marina (Wedd.) Hav., (1936); and Placodium lobulatum Description The vegetative body of the lichen, the thallus, is orange or orange-red in colour and may be continuous or fragmented. When fragmented the thallus looks lumpy under a hand lens; when continuous it is areolate and the margins may be ill-defined with almost no lobes; it is never powdery or pruinose. A light coloured prothallus may be visible in well- developed specimens. Apothecia are small and either scattered through the thallus or grouped in small clusters; diameters rarely greater than 0.8 mm. The orange disc (a deeper colour than the thallus) surface is concave initially but matures to convex; the apothecium rim also narrows giving the effect that the convex disc is spilling over it. Habitat and distribution C. marina is found on coastal rocks from calcareous to high silica rich types (HS). It is characteristically found in the mesic supralittoral zone or above Verrucaria maura (tar lichens).

Located within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the park is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest. Overview White Horse Wood is Kent's newest country park, created as a Millennium project to replace the ancient woodland on top of the North Downs. It is managed by Kent County Council. The site hosts the medieval ruins of Thurnham Castle and also traces of an Iron Age settlement. The 26-hectare site was purchased by Kent County Council specifically to create the park. Over 20,000 trees have been planted at the site including oak, ash, silver birch, wild cherry and crab apple. Five hectares of land has been seeded to create an area of open grassland. The Kent County Agricultural Society has a plot in the wood where it has planted 1,200 specifically Kent-grown trees, including oak, ash, hornbeam and crab apple. In 2009, EDF Energy replaced an overhead electricity cable running through the park with underground cabling to help restore the natural look of the area. The North Downs Way passes through the southern border of the park, between Detling and Broad Street.

She and Columbus became lovers, and in August 1488 she gave birth to their son, Ferdinand.Thomas, p. 172 Another ship was commanded by Pedro de Arana, a cousin of Beatriz, the Admiral's old mistress in Cordoba. Biography Beatriz was born in the small village of Santa Maria of Trassierra (near C√≥rdoba) into a family of peasant farmers and small share holders.The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol 4, pp. 858-859 and had two brothers.Thacher, p. 424Young, p. 101 According to historian Rafael Ram√≠rez de Arellano, her father or stepfather was Pedro de Torquemada of converso origin and her mother was Ana N√∫√±ez de Arana. In his history of Cordoba he explains that she and her brother Peter took the name of their maternal aunt Mayor Enr√≠quez de Arana. She was one of the relatives who took them in (with possibly Francisco Enriquez de Arana, a wine maker) when they became orphaned in 1471. The N√∫√±ez de Arana families were small landholders of modest means. Beatriz knew how to read and write, an unusual thing at the time, which indicates she had at least some status. Most historians agree that the lower social status of Beatriz is the reason why Columbus never married her, as he aspired to a woman of higher degree to help benefit his ventures.History of Cordoba from its foundation to the death of Isabel the Catholic. Ciudad Real: Tipograf√≠a del Hospicio Provincial, 1915-1919Phillips, p. 126 Marriage to a low-born orphan would do nothing to enhance his prestige and would surely impede his search for noble status. =Relationship with Columbus= In 1479 Columbus had traveled to Lisbon, to conduct trade and visit his brother, where he met and married Filipa Moniz about 1479 or 1480, producing a son named Diego. Columbus' wife died in 1484, according to some historians; others speculate he may have simply deserted her and took their child, then around five years old, and moved to Spain.Wilford, p. 84 His wife had died earlier that year, according to Hernando (or did he walk out on her, as Henry Harrisse supposes from an interlinear reading of a letter Columbus wrote in 1500?)Ryan, p. 27 Henry Harrisse, the \\"great authority\\", cannot produce facts, but he \\"thinks\\" that Columbus's first wife was living when he met Beatriz. Posthumous portrait of Christopher Columbus by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio In early 1486, Columbus was living in the court of the Spanish monarchs in Seville, while trying to convince them to finance his \\"Enterprise of the Indies\\". King Ferdinand V and Queen Isabella I were preoccupied at the time trying to unify Spain. They were interested in Columbus's idea but couldn't give it their full attention while the war in Granada was going on against the Moors. Meanwhile, Columbus was given subsistence and allowed to stay at the monarchs' castle in Cordoba as his project promised the possibility of future riches and spread of Christianity.Wilford, pp. 87-89Brinkb√§umer, pp. 87-88 While waiting for a decision and another meeting with the Spanish monarchs, Columbus patronized a local apothecary shop that was operated by people from Genoa, Italy, his probable birthplace. At the pharmacy he became a friend of a young Basque man named Diego de Arana.Wilford, p. 89 Diego had two orphaned cousins in his family's household: Beatriz Enr√≠quez de Arana and her brother Pedro Enr√≠quez de Arana. Diego introduced Beatriz, then 20 or 21 years old, to the 35 year old Columbus in 1487. In August 1488, they had a son named Ferdinand (aka Hernando Colon),Young, p. 104 but did not marry. Diego's family, who adopted Beatriz, had a prosperous wine business. They may have helped Columbus with money for his expeditions. When Columbus left for his first expedition to the New World, the two children, Diego and Ferdinand, were turned over to Beatriz to bring up. The care she gave them was noted and praised by Queen Isabella. Some historians think that the award money intended for the look-out man that would be the first to spot land went instead to Columbus's mistress.Young, p. 264 \\"less excusable was his acceptance of the pension of ten thousand maravedis which had been offered to the member of the expedition who should first sight land...It may be true, as Oviedo alleges, that Columbus transferred it to Beatriz Enriquez; Thomas, p. 87 Before he left, Columbus was conceded a pension of 10,000 maravedis a year, deriving from the royal income in Cordoba; and it was there that, in this first year, Columbus's mistress, Beatriz Enriquez de Arana, received the money. When Columbus died he left some provision for her in his will, directing his son Diego to hold her in respect and continue an annual allowance.Brinkb√§umer, p. 292 for Beatriz Enriquez, mother of Fernando, my son, that she may be able to live honestly, being a person to whom I am under very great obligation.... Diego appears to have been a bit remiss with payments; Beatriz' last recorded act in 1521 was hiring an attorney to collect some money, and Diego's will written in 1532 contained a directive that any unpaid monies from the last three or four years were to be paid out to Beatriz' heirs. Neither her cause of death, or the exact date have been recorded, but it is assumed to have taken place shortly after 1521.

This strange biotope and geotope has been formed into a natural hollow in the terrain that is termed a sinkhole. The area is environmentally protected.  Location  The Bullenkuhle lies about 15 kilometres south of the town of Uelzen and a good kilometre west of the village of Bokel (in the municipality of Sprakensehl) at the edge of a large pine forest at a height of about above NN. A stream emerges in the immediate vicinity which is initially called the Bokeler Bach and, later, becomes the Aue and finally, after combining with other streams, becomes an Elbe tributary, the River Ilmenau. The area belongs to the southeast fringes of the Hohen Heide in the centre of the L√ºneburg Heath. This landscape formed from end and ground moraines and periglacial sediments was created geomorphologically mainly by the edges of the ice sheet during the later phases of the Saalian glaciation, i.e. during the so-called Drenthe II stage and the final glacial advance of the Warthe stage. The crests of the undulating ridges of end moraines are usually covered with pine forests growing on sandy soils; the ground moraines were used for agriculture. The typical open heath landscape of the L√ºneburg Heath - which arose anthropogenically through overexploitation of forests, burning, plaggen cutting and grazing - only exists today in fragments in the area around the Bullenkuhle. The macroclimate of the L√ºneburg Heath is maritime temperate.  Formation of the sinkhole  The Bullenkuhle in early spring. A bog pond can be seen in the background In north Germany there are numerous salt domes under the ground ‚Äì relicts of the Zechstein Sea from the Permian period, which were later relocated and deformed tectonically. When rock salt comes into contact with ground water it leaches away; i.e. the salt is absorbed by the water and transported off. This can lead to the development of large caverns that finally cave in. Sometimes such an event at a depth of several hundred metres can result in the ground collapsing right up to the surface. This results in prominent, often steep-sided and deep hollows called sinkholes or dolines (although dolines can have other morphogenetic causes, particularly in karst regions). Many of these funnel-shaped hollows remain dry, in others water collects that can later become marshy. Sinkholes are geologically often very recent; it is not uncommon for them to be only a few thousand years old and many hollows only date back a few hundred years. Examples of sinkhole lakes and marshes include very large lakes like the Arendsee and the Zwischenahner Meer ‚Äì both at least 500 hectares in area ‚Äì the Seeburger See, the Sager Meer in Oldenburg district, the Rudower See in Westprignitz district or the \\"bottomless marsh\\" (Grundloses Moor) in Soltau-Fallingbostel district and Maujahn in L√ºchow-Dannenberg district. The Bullenkuhle belongs to this group, albeit considerably smaller. This sinkhole has a diameter of about and attains a depth of . Exactly when the Bullenkuhle was formed is not known. This would need a stratigraphic investigation and pollen analysis of the vertical profile of the sinkhole (see Maujahn Moor).  Description  The visitor to the Bullenkuhle comes across a basin-shaped hollow with steep sides of 30 to 60¬∞ in places. At the foot of the slopes of glacial sands is a marsh covering about that on closer inspection turns out to be a 'quaking bog' (Schwingrasen or Schwingmoor) - a floating mat of moss and other plants, under which there is presumably no homogeneous layer of peat, but at least in places just a body of water. The floating mat covers at least 80% of the wetland or marsh, only in the northeast is there stretch of open water about in area and several metres deep; a so-called bog pond. With an electrolytic conductivity of 24 ŒºS/cm this wetland is very oligotrophic, it is rich in humus and, with a pH value of 5.0, moderately acidic. It is populated by typical marsh plants like peat mosses, bladderworts and the rare Dwarf White Water Lily (Nymphaea candida). In addition to peat mosses, the floating mat pressing in on the bog pond consists mainly of Hare's-tail Cottongrass, Cross-leaved Heath, Common Heather and Crowberry; as well as White Beak-sedge and Cranberry. The largely unwooded terrain can be described as flat to slightly rounded intermediate marsh (Zwischenmoor). On its periphery is a ring-shaped bog, which is slightly better supplied with nutrients from precipitation running down the slopes than the centre of the marsh. Bottle Sedge reeds thrive particularly well here. The slopes of the funnel-shaped terrain are covered with low vegetation such as Common Heather, Bilberry, and Cranberry, and also with Purple Moor Grass and trees. The latter include several very large and old Juniper bushes and trees, especially conspicuous and typical of the terrain. Other varieties include birch trees, Buckthorn bushes and pines. The animal world is also noteworthy and some species are peculiar to marsh biotopes. In particular there are up to eight species of amphibian as well as adders.  Literature  *J.

This level of ownership was so great that, in 2010, the total number of vehicles dropped significantly for the first time, falling by four million to 247 million. Overall, across the world, levels of ownership increased fourfold between 1950 and 1999, from 48 people per automobile in 1950 to just 12. Forms of ownership A car is typically a major purchase and so there are a variety of financial schemes to facilitate the purchase. These include hire purchase, company cars, trade-in and leasing. Other forms of provision which centralise the ownership as a service include rental, car sharing and vehicle hire. Legal requirements In some countries, there are additional regulations that must be fulfilled before purchasing or leasing a car. For example, in Japan, due to the high population density and the limited space, a prospective owner must first provide proof of a space to park the car in question (proof-of- parking).Application procedure for a vehicle parking space (garage) certificateGuidebook of daily life for foreign residentsVisitor information and life guide In the Phillipines and India, there is also interest in introducing proof-of-parking.Senator Gatchalian wants Proof-of-Parking Space Act fast-trackedBengaluru: Vehicle owners may have to show proof of parking =Consequences of legal requirements= In Japan, the proof-of-parking regulation, combined with high taxing, has caused a class of cars known as kei cars (kei jid≈çsha) to develop. These small cars, limited in dimension (3.40x1.48x2.00m length, width and height) and engine displacement (660 cc or 0.66 L) are popular due to tax discounts on the excise tax (3% instead of 5% for normal vehicles), the weight tax (30% cheaper), and the insurance cost is also more than 10% lower and the annual road tax, calculated on the engine size.Bright future for kei cars Ownership documents =Title= In the United States, vehicle ownership is documented on a certificate of title.Massachusetts Title Law In the United States, each state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Registry of Motor Vehicles issues such documents when a vehicle is registered. Title deeds vary by design but always include vehicle- specific information at the front of the document (such as: year, make, model, VIN, color, etc.) and several boxes for transaction information at the back where information about change of ownership is recorded (such as sale date, odometer reading, seller and buyer names and signatures, etc.). In-state vehicle sales are recorded at the back of the title as long as there are unused reassignment boxes. If a vehicle is sold out-of-state, the new owner must apply for a new title at their local DMV office. =MCO= In the United States, the Manufacturer‚Äôs Certificate of Origin (MCO), also known as Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO) is the ownership document issued by the vehicle manufacturer that assigns ownership of a new vehicle to a franchise car dealership until said vehicle is registered and titled.Alaska New Vehicle Ownership Documents This document is similar to the title deed in content, but is to be used among licensed car dealers only. Rates of car ownership In the developed world the number of cars per 100 people is generally between 30 and 50, with a few countries (such as Canada and New Zealand) over this. In China there are 15 cars per 100 people, and very poor countries such as Somalia have less than one car per thousand people. In 2007, the expectation was that the rate of car ownership would be increasing almost everywhere, and rise very rapidly indeed in countries such as China and India. About ten years later however, there is a trend from car ownership towards shared mobility.The Shift From Personal Car Ownership To Shared Mobility Is Well UnderwayThe future of mobility: What's next?How shared mobility will change the automotive industry See also *Economics of automobile usage *Effects of the automobile on societies *Carsharing *Costs of car ownership in Singapore *Firearms license: typically required to own a firearm *History of the automobile *Modal shift *NEV's *Electric velomobiles References ","title":"Car ownership"},{"id":"23111482","text":"your bitcoinLocation of Hamblen County in Tennessee This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hamblen County, Tennessee.

Data from Wang et al., \\"TDAG8 is a proton-sensing and psychosine-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor\\". Proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors are transmembrane receptors which sense acidic pH and include GPR132 (G2A), GPR4, GPR68 (OGR1) and GPR65 (TDAG8). These G protein-coupled receptors are activated when extracellular pH falls into the range of 6.4-6.8 (typical values are above 7.0). The functional role of the low pH sensitivity of the proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors is being studied in several tissues where cells respond to conditions of low pH including bone and inflamed tissues. The four known proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors are Class A receptors in subfamily A15.  Nociception  Pain sensation can be initiated by nociceptor cells that are sensory neurons with cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia. Some nociceptors respond to low pH and the pH-sensitive amiloride-sensitive cation channel 3 has been described as a modulator of acid-induced pain sensation. However, results with amiloride-sensitive cation channel 3 gene knockout mice suggest that those channels do not fully account for acid-induced pain sensation. Proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be expressed in small-diameter neurons responsible for nociception where they may play a role in acid-induced pain sensation. Acid- sensing neuron-mediated immediate pungent pain has been associated with acid- sensing ion channels.  Other functions  Mice lacking the Ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 gene (OGR1) had slower melanoma growth (KO) than control mice with OGR1 (FL), possibly due to a difference in macrophage activity. Mice lacking each of the four identified proton-sensing GPCRs have been studied. Results so far suggest that these GPCRs might regulate cell proliferation (immune system cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages), but due to redundancy and expression of multiple proton-sensing GPCRs family members in the same cell, multiple gene knockouts are needed. Results for mice lacking OGR1 suggested a possible role for proton-sensing GPCRs in osteoclasts.

Headquartered in Nashville, it is an independent state agency, administratively attached to the Department of Environment and Conservation. Its mission is to protect, preserve, interpret, maintain, and administer historic places; to encourage the inclusive diverse study of Tennessee's history for the benefit of future generations; to mark important locations, persons, and events in Tennessee history; to assist in worthy publication projects; to review, comment on and identify projects that will potentially impact historic properties; to locate, identify, record, and nominate to the National Register of Historic Places all properties which meet National Register criteria, and to implement other programs of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. The Tennessee Historical Commission also refers to the entity consisting of 24 Governor-appointed members and five ex officio members. History Tennessee Historical Commission marker The Commission was established as the \\"Tennessee Historical Committee\\" in January, 1919. Its initial purpose was to memorialize events pertaining to World War I. In 1921 an amendment to the Act that created the Committee expanded its duties toward its modern mission, designating that the Committee could \\"care for the proper marking and preservation of battlefields, houses, and other places celebrated in the history of the state.\\" After a decade of inactivity following the death of its first Chairman John Trotwood Moore in 1929, it was re-energized in 1940 by Governor Prentice Cooper. A partnership with the Tennessee Historical Society began in 1942 to produce the Tennessee Historical Quarterly, which is still published today. In 1951 the historic marker program was founded. Since then, approximately 2,000 markers have been erected across the state. Following the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the Commission was designated as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). There are 29 Commission members, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Governor (8 per Grand Division) and five ex officio members, including the Governor, State Archaeologist, State Librarian, State Historian, and the Commissioner of Environment and Conservation. The Board meets three times a year, usually the third Friday of February, June, and October. As of 2020 the Commission has a professional staff of 18. The staff administers the Federal programs including the National Register of Historic Places, Section 106 review, the Certified Local Government Program, survey, and historic tax credits. State programs include historic markers, state-owned historic sites, cemetery preservation, and the Tennessee Wars Commission. Since 1994 the Commission's offices have been located in Clover Bottom Mansion, an 1850s-era National Register-listed Italianate-style house in the Donelson area of Nashville, Tennessee. This historic property had been unused for over a decade when it was restored for use by the Commission. The historic outbuildings, including two former c. 1858 two slave cabins, a c. 1850s carriage house, and an 1890s horse barn were restored in 2015-16. Over 150 native species trees were planted, and a walking trail was added. The grounds are open to the public during daylight hours, but there are currently no tours of the house (which does not contain period furnishings or exhibits.) Chairmen and Executive Staff Seventeen individuals have served as Chairman of the Tennessee Historical Commission. For many years, the Director of the Tennessee State Library and Archives was also by virtue of the position the Chairman of the Commission. The names and terms of the chairmen are as follows: John Trotwood Moore (Nashville) c. 1919-1929; Judge Samuel Cole Williams, (Johnson City) 1940-1946; William E. Beard (Nashville) 1946-1950; Dan M.

Since then, the Wars Commission has helped protect over 7000 acres in Tennessee. Three individuals have served as program director since that time, including Fred Prouty, who served from 1994 until 2016. Most of the protected properties are Civil War sites, such as Parkers Crossroads Battlefield and Davis Bridge Battlefield. A significant property, Camp Blount in Fayetteville, was also saved under the lead efforts of the Tennessee Wars Commission and was the only War of 1812-era site preserved as part of the National Bicentennial commemoration of that conflict. The Wars Commission has a grant program that has provided over $2 million in funding since its inception.

Gameplay Mew and Ivysaur fighting with the enemy Pok√©mon The player controls Pok√©mon as they battle other Pok√©mon in a series of linear dungeons and enclosed arenas. The game features real-time melee- based gameplay, which has been likened to that of Smash TV. The game uses a Wii Remote held sideways by default, but also supports the Nunchuk, Classic Controller (Pro) and GameCube Controller. Using one of the attachment controllers allows two players to share the same Wii Remote. Controllers can be changed at the Multiplayer booth in the Terminal area after finishing the first stage. The player starts off with a low-level Pok√©mon with only one attack at their disposal. By battling wild Pok√©mon through a number of levels the player collects coins which can be used to buy new attacks or recruit more Pok√©mon. When the player obtains a high enough level Pok√©mon, the doors to the Battle Royale room open, where they take on dozens of Pok√©mon at a time in an enclosed arena. The player must defeat all of the Pok√©mon in order to rank up, eventually facing much stronger and even Legendary Pok√©mon. The game supports up to four players simultaneously in co-operative and competitive modes. It also features a password system which unlocks certain Pok√©mon. Passwords have been found in Nintendo Power magazines, the official game website, or online. Development A free demo was available on the Wii Shop Channel. It included a number of functions including: The Normal Introduction, a few stages allowing the player to get the feeling of each stage. Pok√©mon can be recruited and the Terminal can be used. Once a Pok√©mon is recruited with Power Points of 100 or more (or they lose all their lives twice) a short video is displayed in which the Battle Royale doors open and then a screenshot appears stating that the demo is over.

The newer edifice was commissioned to architects Victor Smigelschi and Gheorghe P. Liteanu, and its style relates to the Neo- Br√¢ncovenesc architecture of the period, featuring a pendentive dome with towers on either side of the narthex and a monumental portal at the entrance (outlined by an archvault decorated in cable moulding and acanthus). The cathedral building is divided into three naves flanked by double columns, and its narthex features a balcony. The interior features murals by painters Schnell and the Profeta brothers, while the basement hosts a collection of old books, icons and other religious artifacts. The cathedral collection was set up in the 1980s, decades after the communist regime confiscated Greek-Catholic property and assigned it to the Orthodox Church. It hosts objects of special significance to Orthodox culture in Transylvania, including some 500 old Romanian-language books, over 40 Romanian Orthodox icons on wood or glass (including 17th-century pieces from Corund and Oar-Veti≈ü).

It split from East Kipchak in the middle of the 8th century (the South Altay language likely split earlier). Other East Kipchak dialects gave rise to the modern Kyrgyz language. In some regions of Fergana Province the features of Kipchak are seen, especially in phonetics. These regions (uzbek tuman) are Baghdad, Buvayda, Uchko'prik, and some parts of neighboring regions. Many idioms spoken in Uzbekistan that are now considered part of the Kyrgyz language are actually Fergana Kipchak dialects. According to the E. D. Polivanov, the Fergana Kipchak language existed as a separate idiom as late as in the 1920s. According to A. N. Samoilovich's latest research, some descendants of Fergana Kipchaks identify themselves as a separate ethnic group independent from the Uzbeks, Kazakhs or the Kyrgyz, although closely related to the latter. Some modern Fergana Kipchak dialects seem closely related to the Kipchak‚ÄìNogay group of the Turkic languages.

It marks the historical southernmost entry into New World Street (Nowy ≈öwiat), the Royal Route and the Old Town. The temple is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Warsaw. It was designed in the neoclassical style by renowned Polish architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner, and constructed in the years 1818‚Äì1825. In the late 19th century, St. Alexander's was remodelled into a larger, more grandiose Neo-Renaissance church, with two side towers and a higher ornate dome. It was destroyed during World War II and reconstructed in its initial simpler form by 1952. History The church was established by grateful Varsovians to commemorate tsar Alexander I of Russia, who conferred a constitution to the autonomous Kingdom of Poland after the country was partitioned decades earlier. The temple was designed by Chrystian Piotr Aigner and constructed on a circular ground plan covered by a dome (rotunda) between 1818 and 1825 in the Neoclassical style. The inspiration for the external shape of the shrine was the Pantheon in Rome. The foundation stone was laid on 15 June 1818 by Minister of State Treasury Jan Wƒôgli≈Ñski, replacing indisposed General J√≥zef ZajƒÖczek, Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. St. Alexander's Church was consecrated on 18 June 1826 by primate Wojciech Skarszewski. The main altar in the interior was adorned with oil painting by Franciszek Smuglewicz depicting Crucifixion of Jesus. Fragment of statue of dead Christ by Roman or Florentine sculptor in left side altar. In 1886‚Äì95 the church was rebuilt in Neo- Renaissance style, resulting in a much larger building with two prominent towers and a large peaked dome. The contest for the reconstruction design was announced on 14 April 1883 and the construction was entrusted to the author of the victorious design J√≥zef Pius Dzieko≈Ñski. The original rotunda was enlarged by adding three naves from the Ujazdowskie Avenue and two towers, enhancing the walls and the dome. The southern portico was embellished with relief of Blessing Christ among the Indigents and Cripples by Jan Kry≈Ñski and sculptures by Teofil Gosecki. With these changes, the building became one of the largest in Warsaw. During its existence the church has witnessed a number of historic events, including the 1912 funeral service for Boles≈Çaw Prus, who died a couple of blocks away in his apartment on ulica Wilcza (Wolf Street). The church was destroyed during World War II, in the course of the Warsaw Uprising. During the aerial bombardment by German Luftwaffe in the first days of September 1944, the church was hit by 9 bombs resulting in collapse of the dome, main nave and one of the towers. In the years after the war it stood as a ruin while debates were conducted over whether to rebuild it to its prewar grander appearance, or to its original appearance before reconstruction. In the end, the church was rebuilt between 1949 and 1952 in a form similar to its original simpler design. The 17th-century white marble statue of dead Christ by Roman or Florentine sculptor in left side altar was acquired in Rome by Stanis≈Çaw Herakliusz Lubomirski between 1674 and 1694, and transferred to the St. Alexander's Church in 1826 from other location.

Etymology  The name Esslemont may be of Brittonic origin and originate with the term corresponding to Welsh iselfynydd, meaning \\"low hill\\". History The first mention of Esslemont is as the 'manor of Eislemont' in the 14th century. The lands of Esslemont were passed by marriage from the family of Mareschal by marriage of the heiress Janet to Francis le Chen of Straloch in the 14th century. After the castle was burnt in 1493, Henry Cheyne undertook re-building via a king's licence dated 1500. In 1564 Patrick Cheyne was created baron of Esslemont by Queen Mary, who stayed here during her campaign against the Earl of Huntly, and a fortalice and tower were recorded in 1575‚Äì6.

The castle was then destroyed as the result of a feud between the Cheynes and the Hays. The name of the lands, now as \\"Essilmounthe\\", appears in Scottish records in 1609. The castle ceased to be regularly occupied in 1625, when the estate passed to the Errol family. In 1728 it became the property of Robert Gordon and may have been partially occupied till 1769, when the existing mansion, Esslemont House, was erected in its vicinity.Ian Shepherd.

Faireno's race conditioning was the responsibility of Belair Stud's future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer \\"Sunny Jim\\" Fitzsimmons and his assistant, George Tappen. Racing career Raced at age two, among Faireno's wins were the Victoria Stakes at Old Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Nursery Handicap at Belmont Park, and the Junior Champion Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. At age three in 1932, after a poor performance in the Wood Memorial Stakes, Faireno did not run in the Kentucky Derby. Although he was shipped to Pimlico Race Course for the Preakness Stakes, he was withdrawn a few days before the race and sent back to his base in New York. In late May, Faireno ran second in the Campfire Purse at Belmont Park then on June 4 lead virtually all the way to win the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes.https://www.nytimes.com/1932/06/05/archives/15000-see-faireno-win- belmont-stakes-woodward-colt-leads-virtually.html Faireno went on to win the Shevlin Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack in June, the Dwyer Stakes on July 2, was eight in the Arlington Classic, and then won the Hawthorne Handicap on August 6 before running second to Plucky Play in the August 27th Hawthorne Gold Cup.

Despite his shortened 1932 campaign, Faireno still retrospectively shared American Champion Three-Year- Old Male Horse honors with Burgoo King. On April 22, 1934, Faireno returned in the Paumonok Handicap at Jamaica Race Course. Racing for the first time in nearly a year and a half, he was in contention for most of the race but tired in the stretch and finished fourth.https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D11FF3E5C16738DDDAE0894DD405B838FF1D3 However, he regained his old form and went on to win the 1934 Empire City Handicap, defeated Discovery to win the Havre de Grace Handicap, won the Merchants and Citizens Handicap at Saratoga Race Course, and October's Rochambeau Handicap at Narragansett Park. Faireno raced at age six in 1935 but with limited success. Stud record Faireno was retired to stud but proved to be sterile.

It succeeded the Socialist Review, journal of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Labor Age advocated industrial unionism, economic planning, and workers' education (especially the activities of Brookwood Labor College).

The Socialist Review and Labor Age were the official publications of the League for Industrial Democracy from 1921‚Äì1929. In May 1929, the editors of Labor Age helped to form the Conference for Progressive Labor Action (CPLA) in order to counter what they considered growing pro-business tendencies in the American Federation of Labor.

Forming from an area of low pressure on August 3, Meranti gradually strengthened. On August 5, the storm underwent a brief period of rapid intensification, attaining its peak intensity later that day. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the storm attained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10-minute winds) while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm attained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 1-minute winds). The following day, the typhoon quickly weakened to a tropical storm due to unfavorable conditions. By August 9, the system completed an extratropical transition; the remnants of the storm persisted until August 13, at which time it was absorbed by a large, non-tropical low. Meteorological history Typhoon Meranti originated out of an area of low pressure about 475 km (295 mi) south of Wake Island on August 2. Little deep convection accompanied the weak system despite being situated within an area of moderate diffluence and weak to moderate wind shear. Initially, the system was thought to have been much closer to Wake Island; however, following the development of deep convection, the location of the center of circulation was corrected. Around 0000 UTC on August 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the western Pacific basin, designated the system as a tropical depression. Development continued as the depression moved into an area of divergence near a tropical upper-tropospheric trough cell. Several hours after the JMA issued their advisory on the depression, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, stating that the system was likely to develop into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Later on August 3, the JTWC issued their first advisory on the storm, classifying it as Tropical Depression 14W. Located to the west of a mid-level ridge, the depression was steered towards the north. Early the next day, the JTWC upgraded 14W to a tropical storm; the JMA later upgraded it to a tropical storm around 1200 UTC. At that time, the storm received the name Meranti, a name that was contributed by Cambodia. Little intensification took place until August 5, at which time convection became increasingly organized and underwent a brief period of rapid intensification. By 1200 UTC, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded Meranti to a typhoon. Several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity; the JMA assessed it to have had winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC assessed it to have attained Category 2 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Upon attaining typhoon status, Meranti turned towards the northeast in response to a strengthening near-equatorial ridge south of the typhoon. Visible satellite images of the typhoon depicted a small, ragged eye within a well-developed cyclone. Gale-force winds extended 155 km (100 mi) at this time. Well-developed outflow allowed the storm to maintain its peak intensity for roughly 18 hours before dry air became entrained in the circulation. The combined effects of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused Meranti to quickly weaken. By 0600 UTC on August 6, the eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery and several hours later deep convection rapidly diminished, leading to both agencies downgrading the typhoon to a tropical storm. Later on August 6, the weakening trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved due to an area of low pressure north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the weakening cyclone around 0600 UTC on August 8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August 9\\\\. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August 12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August 13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over the Bering Sea. Impact As Typhoon Meranti never threatened any land masses, no watches or warnings were issued in response to the storm. Although Meranti passed near Wake Island as a tropical depression, no effects were recorded.

It is considered one of her iconic works. The canvas shows the scene of Judith beheading Holofernes. Early feminist critics interpreted the painting as a form of visual revenge following Gentileschi's rape by Agostino Tassi in 1611; more recent analysis of the painting has taken a broader view, seeing the painting in the context of Gentileschi's achievement in portraying strong women. The subject takes an episode from the apocryphal Book of Judith in the Old Testament, which recounts the assassination of the Assyrian general Holofernes by the Israelite heroine Judith. The painting shows the moment when Judith, helped by her maidservant Abra, beheads the general after he has fallen asleep drunk. She also painted a later version of the work somewhere between 1613 and 1621, now in the Uffizi in Florence.  Creation  Artemisia Gentileschi was roughly twenty years of age when she painted Judith Slaying Holofernes. Previously, Gentileschi had also completed Susanna and the Elders and Madonna and Child. These artworks already given an indication of Gentileschi's skill in representing body movement and facial expressions to express emotions. X-rays undertaken on the painting show that Gentileschi made several alterations to the painting (eg the position of Judith's arms, the position of the drapery) before it reached its current state.  Subject Matter  = Biblical Source = The episode of Judith beheading Holofernes is from a deuterocanonical book of the Bible. The episode is from the apocryphal Book of Judith in the Old Testament, which recounts the assassination of the Assyrian general Holofernes by the Israelite heroine Judith. Gentileschi draws upon the most climactic part of the Book of Judith where the beheading takes place.  Theme  Judith Slaying Holofernes has been considered to be related to the Power of Woman theme. Historian Susan L. Smith defines the \\"power of woman\\" as \\"the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of woman, the power of love and the trials of marriage. Gentileschi plays into the \\"wiles of woman\\" in her painting by literally portraying Judith at the main point of her domination of over a man. Judith is shown as a beautiful woman which enticed Holofernes and also as a fierce heroine.  Visual Analysis  The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide spurts of blood to the energy of the two women as they perform the act. The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, who is younger than in other treatments of the same theme, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Judith Slaying Holofernes utilises deeper primary colours in comparison to the Florentine version. Judith is shown wearing a cobalt blue dress with gold accents and her maidservant wears a red gown. Both woman have their sleeves rolled up. As a follower of Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi makes use of chiaroscuro in the painting, with a dark background contrasting with the light shining directly on the scene of Judith beheading Holofernes.  History  Little is known of the painting's early history. There is no information as of yet on the patron of this artwork. Its location was unknown until documented in the collection of Signora Saveria de Simone in Naples in 1827. At some point in the painting's history, the left and top parts of the painting were cut off, leaving a curtailed version of the original painting.  Depictions of Judith  Many different artists have portrayed the biblical heroine Judith. = Renaissance = Donatello, Judith and Holoferenes, c. 1457‚Äì1464. Bronze; 236cm Palazzo Vecchio, Florence The Renaissance had a long-standing history of portraying Judith. Many artists believed that the heroine Judith held many different qualities like chastity and humility. Lucas Cranach the Elder painted a very straightforward version of Judith now known as Judith with the Head of Holofernes. Cranach's Judith is shown with a resolved look on face as she holds a sword in her hand. She wears an ornate green dress and the viewer can only see up to her mid-thigh region. Her body is cut off due to a marble ledge were the head of Holofernes sits. There is no gushing blood and Judith seems to have made a clean cut through Holofernes head. The phlegmatic look on Judith's face reverberate the intensity of her beheading. Gentileschi captures the emotions of Judith's face but maintains more medical accuracy with the blood that is spilling down the bed. Genitleschi's Judith Slaying Holofernes shows Judith in the act of beheading rather than showing her with the head of Holofernes as Cranach did. Donatello also contributed his own interpretation with his sculpture known as Judith and Holofernes. In this sculpture, Judith is seen towering over Holofernes with a sword over her head. Holofernes body slumps over and his head is still attached to his body. Donatello's Judith and Holofernes sought to symbolize the theme of pride in both Holofernes and offer as a cautionary tale to the Medici family. Writer Roger J. Crum notes that \\"Judith's gesture, pulling back the general's head, rendures sure her next blow, it also makes the neck all the more visible. Behold the neck of pride,\\" commanded the inscription, and Donatello's treatment facilitated compliance\\". Unlike Donatello's sculpture, Gentileschi shows Judith triumphing over Holofernes in the climatic moment of the beheading. Gentileschi also chose to show Judith without a head covering and includes Judith's maidservant. Johann Liss. Judith in the Tent of Holoferenes, c. 1622. Oil on canvas; 128.5 x 99 cm. The National Gallery, Londonalt= = Baroque = Judith beheading Holofernes was a very popular story amongst Baroque artists. Artemisia Gentileschi's contemporary Johann Liss stayed abreast with the Baroque style by including macabre imagery in his painting, Judith in the Tent of Holofernes. The painting shows the headless body of Holofernes slumping over. Judith sweeps Holofernes's head into a basket showing a look of swiftness about her. The viewer can see the maidservant's head in the background while the rest of her body is unseen. She seems eager to see what directions Judith will give her next. The decapitated body of Holofernes has blood gushing out of it, showing Liss's interest in the human body. Gentileschi has a similar urgency in her painting but shows Judith in mid-decapitation rather than showing Holofernes headless body. Gentileschi also uses the same amount of bloodiness in her painting.  Caravaggio Influence  Caravaggio's Judith Beheading Holofernes shows a different portrayal of this scene. Mary Gerrard points out that Caravaggio \\"reintroduced a narrative emphasis, but focusing now upon the dramatic rather than the epic features of the story and upon the human conflict between the two principal characters\\". Caravaggio shows Holofernes holding the blood coming from his neck like a string. Rather than making the scene of Holofernes's beheading more palatable for the viewers, Gentileschi differs by not holding back the gruesome imagery. Gentileschi also shows Judith putting her full efforts into the slaying, even by employing her maidservant. In both Caravaggio and Gentileschi's paintings there is a notable absence of decorative detail in the background.\\"Judith Beheading Holofernes\\". Web Gallery of Art. Retrieved on June 6, 2009. Judith beheading Holofernes has been depicted by a number of artists including Giorgione, Titian, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens and Caravaggio. Caravaggio's Judith Beheading Holofernes is believed to be the main source of this work, and his influence shows in the naturalism and violence Gentileschi brings to her canvas.  Related paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi  Gentileschi painted another painting, Judith and her Maidservant (1613‚Äì14), which shows Judith holding a dagger while her maidservant carries a basket containing a severed head. Judith and her Maidservant is displayed in the Palazzo Pitti, in Florence. A further three paintings by Gentileschi, in Naples, Detroit and Cannes, show her maid covering the head of Holofernes, while Judith herself looks out the frame of the picture. Gentileschi's father and fellow painter, Orazio Gentileschi was also very much influenced by Caravaggio's style and painted his own version of the tale, Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes.  Historiography  There have been many different interpretations and viewpoints on Judith Slaying Holofernes by art historians and biographers alike. Art historian Mary Garrard believes that Judith Slaying Holofernes portrays Judith as a \\"socially liberated woman who punishes masculine wrongdoing\\". Although the painting depicts a scene from the Bible, art historians have suggested that Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor Agostino Tassi, who was tried for and convicted of her rape, as Holofernes. Gentileschi's biographer Mary Garrard famously proposed an autobiographical reading of the painting, stating that it functions as \\"a cathartic expression of the artist's private, and perhaps repressed, rage\\".Mary Garrard, Artemisia Gentileschi (1989), qtd. in Griselda Pollock suggests that the painting should be \\"read less in terms of its overt references to Artemisia‚Äôs experience than as an encoding of the artist's sublimated responses to events in her life and the historical context in which she worked.\\" More recent discussion of the painting has moved away from too close a relationship to the rape of Gentileschi; rather it has focussed on Gentileschi's determination to paint strong women who are the centre of the action.  Reception  The reception for Judith Slaying Holofernes varied. The Florentine biographer Filippo Baldinucci described Judith Slaying Holofernes as \\"inspiring no little amount of terror.\\" At times the painting has popular, mainly due to the grotesque nature of the biblical scene, but also because of the artist's gender. Yet when the painting was sold by Signora Saveria de Simone in 1827, it was sold as a work of Caravaggio. This confusion shows Gentileschi's dedication as a caravagistta. In recent decades, there has been much art historical interest in this painting, with Eva Straussman- Pflanzer explaining that \\"the painting has... gained... distinction due to its feminist-inspired inclusion in the history of art\\".  Media  Judith Slaying Holofernes can be seen on display in the Boardwalk Empire episode ‚ÄúThe Age of Reason‚Äù.

Some pet owners use these collars for GPS tracking and geofencing of their pets.  Effects on Animals  It was believed that GPS collars used on animals affected their behavior. This theory was tested on elephants that lived in a zoo in the United States. They studied how the elephants behaved with and without the collars for the same amount of time for both scenarios and saw no change in behavior. A study was done with mantled howler monkeys to see if GPS Ball and Chain collars had any effect on the monkeys behavior. The study involved observing a group of collared and uncollared female howler monkeys. There was no major difference in the collared and uncollared behavior but when the study was over it was discovered that the monkeys had injuries. The collars had caused damage to the necks of the monkeys; one had small scratches and some swelling while four other monkeys had deep cuts from the collar. Two of the monkeys with the lacerations had their tissue healing over the collar.  Tracking Technology and Battery life  Internet-enabled tracking collars for animals need to be designed with a multiple year lifespan to avoid interference with the animals. Satellite tracking devices are deployed in ultra remote areas. In-order to preserve battery power the device only powers on when it is required. GSM or cellular technology is widely deployed where connectivity is available - however GSM is also highly intensive on battery power. Devices either have a large battery or are only powered on when required. Sigfox or LoRa are new technologies powering the Internet of Things connectivity. These technologies are beginning to be deployed in remote areas due to their ease of deployment and incredibly long range. The advantages of these technologies for an animal tracking collar is that the device form size can be minimised and the battery life extended greatly. Sigfox has already covered large parts of the Kruger National Park in South Africa allowing rangers to better track smaller forms of wildlife.

State ‚Äì 83% Special education In December 2011, Bellefonte Area School District administration reported that 444 pupils or 15.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 45.7% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, the district administration reported that 450 pupils or 15.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Director of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Bellefonte Area School District received a $1,599,993 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2013‚Äì14, 2012‚Äì13 and the 2011-12 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania's Students ‚Äì Special Education Funding, June 2012 Additionally, the State provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The Bellefonte Area School District Administration reported that 38 or 1.26% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. Gifted children are provided services by a certified teacher in a separate classroom. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by a child's teachers or parents by contacting the student's principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. At Bellefonte Area High School the gifted program, under the direction of their parents and teachers, develop an Individually Prescribed Educational Plan which determines their course of study. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days' public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Bellefonte Area School District was $50,665.60 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $21,337.61 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $72,003.20.

School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 For the 2012-13 school year budget, the district intends to use $1.36 million from its substantial fund balance to achieve a balanced budget. The Board approved four new teaching positions: two learning support teachers for math, one teacher for autistic students and one language arts coach for the new language arts curriculum. Audit In April 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The significant findings were reported to the Bellefonte Area School Board and the district's administration. Specifically, the audit of nonresident pupil membership for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2008-09 school years found discrepancies in reports submitted to the Department of Education. The district's state funding was adjusted accordingly. Tuition Students who live in the Bellefonte Area School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Bellefonte Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School ‚Äì $8,796.74, High School ‚Äì $11,827.43.

The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Bellefonte Area School District receives 32.1% of its annual revenue from the state.

These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For the 2010-11 school year, the Bellefonte Area School District applied for and received $459,342 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide all-day kindergarten for the 6th year and for teacher training. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Bellefonte Area School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07 nor in 2007-08. The district applied for and received $165,458 in 2008-09. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County ‚Äì $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Science It's Elementary grant Pleasant Gap Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008-09. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 66,973 students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It's Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program was a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem- solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It's Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Science: It's Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The school district administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The grant was discontinued in the state's 2011 budget by Governor Edward G. Rendell. Other grants The Bellefonte Area School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, 2012 and 2013 Hybrid Learning Grants, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Bellefonte Area School District received an extra $2,773,929 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. In 2009, the district reported that 798 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income. In 2008, there were 722 low-income students.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Basic Education Allocations Reports 2009 & 2010 Race to the Top grant Bellefonte Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Governor's Press release January 20, 2010 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign in support of the grant.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. School districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

Pfannenstiel as seen from nearby Felsenegg Pfannenstiel summit as seen from Au Peninsula Hochwacht and Okensh√∂he Guldenen Pannestiel as seen from Frauenwinkel protected area on Seedamm lake shore  Geography  Pfannenstiel (Swiss German: Pfannenstil meaning pan handle) is commonly used for the mountain and the region of a longish mountain area. It is located in the district of Meilen, some in the southeast of the city of Z√ºrich, bordered by Greifensee and Z√ºrcher Oberland in the northeast, Lake Z√ºrich in the southwest and the area around the municipality of Hombrechtikon in the east. In the northwest, Pfannenstiel is bordered by the village of Forch and a former mountain pass () leading from Glatt valley to the Lake Z√ºrich shore. Its highest point (Okensh√∂he) is about 450 metres above the Lake Z√ºrich. From southeast to northwest, Pfannenstiel is part of a chain of peaks respectively mountains: Guldenen (), Wassberg (), √ñschbrig (), Adlisberg (), Z√ºrichberg (), K√§ferberg-Waidberg () and H√∂nggerberg (). The area alongside Lake Z√ºrich had been formed as the left moraine of the Ice Age glacier, the bed of which is now the Lake Z√ºrich.  History and origin of the name  Pfannenstiel inn sign On the origin of the name Pfannenstiel remembers the plate (Inn sign) of the Vorderer Pfannenstiel restaurant: A pan containing pitch used to send smoke signals. In the 17th century or much earlier, the government of the city of Z√ºrich established a system of Hochwachten to warn, in cases of emergency as threat of war, the neighboring Hochwachten on the Albis, near Forch, on Z√ºrichberg, K√§ferberg, Bachtel, Uetliberg, and so on, by fire and smoke. The Pfannenstiel Hochwacht was located on the summit called Okensh√∂he as from there numerous other Hochwachten were in direct sight. For the same reason, in 19th century Okenh√∂he was uses for a triangulation point as other triangulation points can be measured. These measurements form the backbone of the national geographical survey. Nevertheless, the pan with the fire as sign of \\"bad luck\\" it's not the real origin of the term Pfannenstiel: It was first mentioned in documents of the year 1333, and it is assumed that the term points to a meadow and farmland nearby forming a panhandle.Hiking on Pfannenstiel: History  Literary honor  Pfannenstiel got further literary honor: The Swiss poet Albin Zollinger (1895-1941) immortalized Pfannenstiel in his novel ‚ÄûPfannenstiel: Die Geschichte eines Bildhauers‚Äú (‚ÄûThe Story of a Sculptor‚Äú). In the novel, a sculptor returns to Switzerland, and disappointed by the political reality, he retires on Pfannenstiel, builds a house and finds an intact village community. Three weeks before his death at the age of 46, Zollinger met the young Max Frisch on the Pfannenstiel.  Pfannenstiel tower  In 1893 on the Bachtel mountain was built an observation tower of steel which was declared in 1979 by the government of the canton of Z√ºrich as an object of historic preservation. Six years later, the tower was stored by the Swiss Post (former PTT) on technical reasons, and in 1992, the tower was rebuilt on Pfannenstiel. The tower is riveted and is made of steel and cast iron. The reconstruction was done by specialists from Eastern Europe where this technology still was in use. The new location for the reconstruction was initially controversial: The cantonal authorities preferred the highest elevation on the mountain in the middle of forested area. The executive of the municipality of Meilen was not satisfied as it is a protected area. The final location is somewhat below located in the municipality of Egg.  Further points of interest  Pfannenstiel is a picturesque area, and the upper side of the mountain houses four restaurants overlooking Lake Z√ºrich, Etzel, Zimmerberg, Albis, Uetliberg to the south and to the west, and Greifensee, Glattal, Bachtel and Z√ºrcher Oberland to the north and east. The upper part of the mountain is mostly woodland and a popular recreational area with picnic sites, in addition there are hiking routes, among the K√ºsnachter Tobel pathway. In winter season a cross-country skiing trail is a popular point of interest.

It is named after the natural scientist Oken who, in the beginning of the 19th century, did a lot of tours on mountains rarely visited. In 1838 he bought the area now called Okensh√∂he. His heirs donated the land to citizens of the municipality of Meilen. They formed the Mittwochsgesellschaft (Wednesday society) which did not allow to overbuilt this area.

It is now restored and opened to the public on November 1, 2017 as a unit of Sycamore Shoals State Park. The property is operated by the Park under a memorandum of understanding with the Tennessee Historical Commission.http://m.elizabethton.com/2017/10/30/sabine-hill-to-celebrate- opening-with-special-guided-tours/ Construction history Brigadier General Nathaniel Taylor began building Sabine Hill between 1814 and 1816, after returning home to Elizabethton following the War of 1812. Taylor had been one of the earliest settlers in Elizabethton, having arrived as a boy around 1780 when his family migrated from Rockbridge County, Virginia to the settlement along the Watauga River.. Excerpt published by New York Times, September 30, 2001. By 1796, when Carter County was formed and Tennessee became a state, Taylor owned of land. That same year, he became the first sheriff of Carter County and one of the first officers in the new state militia. He later served in the Tennessee General Assembly. During the War of 1812 he had command of the American fortifications at the port of Mobile, Alabama. After Taylor returned from the war, he sought to build an impressive home for his family. He selected a site on a hill with a commanding view of Elizabethton's western entrance and Sycamore Shoals. He named the house Sabine Hill, apparently in imitation of Sabine Hall, the Virginia estate of Landon Carter, and is said to have hired a Philadelphia architect to design the home. Taylor died in 1816, before the house was finished. His wife, Mary \\"Polly\\" Patton Taylor, completed the project circa 1818‚Äì20, after her husband's death. She outlived her husband by 37 years, presiding over Sabine Hill until her death in 1853. Description Rear view of Sabine Hill in 1936 The house is built on a two- story I-house plan with a five-bay front facade. It has a foundation of limestone quarried in the local area. The exterior walls are built from logs that are completely covered by clapboard siding. The floors are random-width pine laid over hand-hewn timber joists. There are brick chimneys on both ends of the structure. The clapboard siding, a fanlight transom over the front door, and the hand-wrought wood trim in the house's interior appear to have been added a few years after the house was built. Originally the house had a split-shingle roof, which had been replaced by galvanized iron as of 1936, when Sabine Hill was visited for the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). A one-story service wing extends from the rear, in an arrangement that was common at the time the house was built. The HABS analysis observed that the interior details of the house were of particularly high quality. Noteworthy features mentioned included \\"delicate and almost elaborately carved\\" fireplace mantels and chamfered joints in the wood paneling on the walls. HABS also saw indications that Sabine Hill's design might have been influenced by architecture in Williamsburg, Virginia, particularly the design features of the Capitol Building there. One design detail noted as similar to features seen in Williamsburg was the use of \\"marbleized\\" wood for wainscoting along the stairway. The interior of Sabine Hill also reflected the patriotism of its owners; traces of the original paint indicate that the interior was painted in the colors of the U.S. flag, with white walls, red molding, and blue wainscoting. Later history In its early decades, Sabine Hill served as both the home of the Taylor family and the headquarters of a large estate that was tended by slaves. At his death, General Nathaniel Taylor was recorded as the owner of a very large amount of land and about 20 slaves. Although the younger members of the family had homes of their own, the Taylor family had a major presence in the Happy Valley area in the vicinity of Sabine Hill. The family grew in prominence and influence during the 19th century. Nathaniel Green Taylor, a grandson of Nathaniel and Mary Taylor, served in the U.S. House of Representatives. His sons Robert Love Taylor and Alfred A. Taylor both were later to become Governor of Tennessee, and Robert Love Taylor also served in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. The property remained in the Taylor family until 1947, but the family stopped living in the home some time in the 19th century. In 1892, a journalist who visited Sabine Hill found the house vacant and in a state of deterioration, although much of its decor and furnishings were intact. In 1936, HABS found the house occupied by a tenant farmer who also rented some surrounding farmland. HABS found the house to be in reasonably sound condition in spite of a lack of recent maintenance. A basement had been added some time before 1936. In 1947 a member of the Taylor family sold the property to the Sabine Hill Realty Company with an instruction that \\"the old house located on this tract must either be razed or remodeled.\\" The property was sold again in 1948 and 1949. James L. Reynolds, who acquired it in 1949, was interested in preserving the house. During his ownership, which continued until 1999, many repairs and alterations were made, including foundation and chimney repairs, installation of new window sashes, and addition of a porch. Reynolds replaced much of the clapboard siding and flipped and sanded many pieces of siding. The house was also equipped with modern kitchen and bathroom fixtures. In 1973, during the Reynolds ownership, Sabine Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After Reynolds' death, his heirs decided to sell the property. After officials of the city of Elizabethton were unsuccessful in an effort to acquire it in order to preserve it, in 2003 it was sold to a couple from Johnson City who hoped to renovate the house and make it into a historic site attraction. They were unable to achieve their goals, and the property was optioned to a developer who wanted to demolish the house and build condominiums on the site. Preservation Sabine Hill was saved from demolition by a group of locals who bought it and held it until it could be purchased by the Tennessee Historical Commission in 2007. The restoration was undertaken by the Tennessee Historical Commission and it is operated as a unit of Sycamore Shoals State Park. It is an excellent example of federal-style architecture.

It opened in stages between 1874 and 1876, after serious difficulties in raising subscription capital, and following alteration to the planned route. It was hoped to serve large reserves of ironstone along its route, but the deposits were not as large as hoped, and the line was never financially successful. The passenger service closed in 1951, and the residual goods service closed in stages from 1956 to 1960. Conception The line in 1877By 1866 the two main lines of the Great Northern Railway in Lincolnshire were well established: the original \\"Lincolnshire Loop\\" line via Lincoln, and the East Lincolnshire Line. The latter had been authorised by Parliament to the East Lincolnshire Railway company, but immediately leased to the GNR, which constructed it and operated it. In the 1860s thought was given to building a line from Louth to Lincoln and beyond, giving Grimsby a direct route to Lincoln; however the rival Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway already provided such a route, via Market Rasen. Nevertheless, in 1966 the Louth and Lincoln Railway was authorised on 6 August 1866; authorised share capital was ¬£250,000. The line was to join the Boston to Lincoln line near Five Mile House, that distance from Lincoln. Huge reserves of ironstone were believed to exist at Apley and Donington on Bain, on the line of route.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 199 and 200Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 342 and 343John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 27 and 28A J Ludlam, Branch Lines of East Lincolnshire: volume 1: Louth to Bardney, published by Lincolnshire Wolds Railway Society, 2015, The eastern entrance to South Willingham tunnelThe Company was in financial difficulties from the start, with problems over land acquisition, and shortage of subscriptions. Already in April 1867 the Directors applied to the Board of Trade to abandon the project, saying that problems with land purchase, and the junction at Five Mile House, were insuperable. The Board of Trade refused the application.Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1986 , pages 46 to 51 Frederick Appleby, a Manchester civil engineer, acquired the company and altered the design, arranging for the branch to join the loop line at Bardney instead, and with the access reversed so that trains ran into a bay and would have to reverse to join the loop line. This was authorised by an Act of 1872. Construction The Great Northern Railway agreed to work the line, but the GNR directors were not willing to commit their own resources to the project, and they refused direct financial aid. So sceptical were they that they insisted on payment in cash or securities for the cost of installation of the junctions. The line was engineered by T Myers; it was single track, laid with 72 lb rails. There were two tunnels, South Willingham (557 yd) between South Willingham and Donington and Withcall (971 yd) between Donington and Hallington. South Willingham tunnel is also known as Benniworth Tunnel or High Street Tunnel, however GEOGIS, the British Rail track and structures database calls it South Willingham Tunnel. The area of the Lincolnshire Wolds through which the line passed was hilly, and severe gradients were unavoidable. Further capital was needed as the original estimate proved to be inadequate. Construction began at the Louth end in January 1872. The work was delayed by bad weather; in addition there was a strike by the bricklayers in the tunnels. Opening and operation Former railway station at Donington on BainGoods traffic was started between and South Willingham on 9 November 1874, and it was extended to Donington on 27 September 1875. The entire line was opened throughout to Louth (Wragby Junction) on 26 June 1876 for goods, and on 1 December for passengers. Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade had inspected it on 31 October but, owing to the incomplete state of works, withheld approval for passenger operation. The issue was the lack of turntables at the ends of the line. He made a second visit on 27 November, then approving it. Stations were at , , , , Donnington on Bain (later ), (in 1882) and . The original service was five trains each way on weekdays only, reduced to four on 1 January 1877. First services ran through to Lincoln, but this too was abandoned, and the branch passenger trains worked from Louth to Bardney. Although some ironstone was extracted locally, the promised huge income from carrying it was lacking. Receipts were poor; eventually, a receiver was appointed and efforts were soon made to sell the undertaking to the GNR. The GNR were not enthusiastic, but in December 1881 they agreed to purchase the line for ¬£200,000. About ¬£380,000 had been expended on building the line.Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 ‚Äì 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 358 The transfer was authorised by an Act of 10 August 1882 and the Company passed into GNR ownership on 30 June 1883. Ideas of altering the junction at Bardney to face Lincoln were put forward in 1882, but it was not put into effect. The GNR changed the signage on the line to reflect their own policies. For instance, the cast iron trespass notices were replaced with GNR versions. They also installed their own mile posts, used to reference any part of the line, but in doing so they changed the origin of the lines mileage. The 1888 OS Map shows that the chainage started at Louth, but subsequent maps show the mile posts in different locations with GEOGIS recording\\"Louth to Bardney Line mileages\\" Railway Codes, Engineer's Line References, Retrieved 10 January 2020 that zero miles was a Kings Cross, routed via , and Bardney. Second World War During World War II many bomber airfields were established in Lincolnshire; in January 1943 a Maintenance Unit, No 233, was formed in the area to store and supply bombs and other equipment. It was given the name of Market Stainton, but in fact comprised some sixty miles of roadside grass verges. The stations used to supply this were Donington on Bain, Withcall and Hallington. It was closed in 1948.

She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars under several notable naval commanders and played a key role in the Battle of Copenhagen under Captain Edward Riou, when Riou commanded the frigate squadron during the attack. After Riou was killed during the battle, command briefly devolved to First-Lieutenant John Quilliam. Quilliam made a significant impression on Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson who appointed him to serve on the flagship , and Amazon passed to William Parker, who continued the association with Nelson with service in the Mediterranean and participation in the chase to the West Indies during the Trafalgar Campaign. She went on to join Sir John Borlase Warren‚Äôs squadron in the Atlantic and took part in the defeat of Charles-Alexandre L√©on Durand Linois's forces at the Action of 13 March 1806. During the battle, she hunted down and captured the 40-gun frigate Belle Poule. Amazon continued in service for several more years, being active in combating raiders and privateers, before being withdrawn from active service in late 1811. She was retained in ordinary until several years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when she was broken up. Construction and commissioning One of two ships built to a design by Sir William Rule, Amazon was ordered from Woolwich Dockyard on 27 April 1796 and laid down there that month. She was launched on 18 May 1799 and quickly put into service, having cost ¬£33,972 to build, including fitting her out. She was commissioned in May 1799 under her first commander, Captain Edward Riou. British waters and the Baltic Riou and the Amazon served initially in the English Channel, capturing the French privateer Bougainville on 14 February 1800. She was out of Saint Malo, mounted eighteen 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 82 men under the command of Pierre Dupont. The next day, she collided with Amazon and eventually sank, with the loss of one man drowned. Amazon sailed from Portsmouth for Jamaica with and on 26 April 1800 as escorts for a large convoy. Amazon would only accompany the convoy to \\"a certain latitude.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.330. On 15 June, Amazon captured the French letter of marque Julie. In November 1827 head money was paid for 21 men. Julie was on her way from Bordeaux to Cayenne when Amazon captured her at . Amazon also recaptured Amelia, late Donaldson, master, which the French privateer Minerve had captured. Amazon sent Amelia into Plymouth, which she reached in early July.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4067. Riou and Amazon were then assigned to Sir Hyde Parker's expedition to the Baltic in 1801, to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality. Engraving made in 1801 of Amazons first commander Edward Riou; \\"Captn Edwd Riou Commander of the Guardian Frigate in the year 1789 but late of His Majesty's ship Amazon who fell gloriously in the Attack of the Danish Fleet and Batteries off Copenhagen April 2nd, 1801\\" Riou worked closely with Parker's second-in-command, Rear- Admiral Horatio Nelson, and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead-up to the Battle of Copenhagen, and Nelson duly appointed Riou commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, instructing Rious to deploy his ships in support of the main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships of the line ran aground on shoals in the harbour, forcing the improvisation of a new plan of attack. As Nelson's ships engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Trekroner Fort and blockships. Although the frigates were heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, they maintained the engagement for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties, and a splinter hit Riou on the head. At 1.15 pm, Parker was waiting outside the harbour with the reserve and raised a signal ordering Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now found himself in a difficult position. Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw. Withdrawing forced his ships to turn their sterns to the Danish guns, thereby exposing their most vulnerable area. When and then withdrew, this reduced the thick cloud of gunsmoke that was helping to obscure the British ships and left Amazon exposed to the full force of the Danish guns. Lieutenant-Colonel William Stuart, commanding the soldiers of the 48th Regiment, recorded that Riou was killed: > [He] was sitting on a gun, was encouraging his men, and had been wounded in > the head by a splinter. He had expressed himself grieved at being thus > obliged to retreat, and nobly observed, 'What will Nelson think of us?' His > clerk was killed by his side; and by another shot, several marines, while > hauling on the main-brace, shared the same fate. Riou then exclaimed, 'Come, > then, my boys, let us all die together!' The words were scarcely uttered, > when the fatal shot severed him in two. Command of Amazon devolved to her first lieutenant, John Quilliam, who completed the withdrawal. Nelson went aboard the badly damaged Amazon after the battle and asked Quilliam how he was doing. Quilliam replied 'Middlin', a response that apparently amused Nelson and may have contributed to Nelson's subsequent appointment of Quilliam as first lieutenant aboard . After the battle, command of Amazon passed to Captain Samuel Sutton. On 22 January 1802, the civilian British sloop Lively was driven in to Amazon in the North Sea off Deal, Kent, England, and foundered. Lively‚Ä≤s crew was rescued. Parker and Nelson =Mediterranean= In November 1802, Sutton was succeeded by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived a brush with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon was one of the ships to take part in the Trafalgar Campaign the following year, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service. Parker and the Amazon remained with Nelson after the division of the Mediterranean commands left the Spanish coasts under the supervision of Sir John Orde. Nelson suspected that Orde was intercepting his despatches and commandeering Nelson's frigates to use himself. Nelson therefore ordered Parker not to stop for any of Orde's ships if this was possible. Parker attempted this but was intercepted by . He was however able to convince the Eurydices commander, William Hoste, to turn a blind eye and having delivered his despatches to Lisbon, acted on Nelson's hint that he was not expected back until February by carrying out a cruise that netted him several prizes worth a total of ¬£20,000. Orde complained about the 'poaching' taking place on his station, but the prize money went to Parker and Nelson. =West Indies and Atlantic= Amazon went on to join Nelson in the chase to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on specific instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but did not want to lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who Pulteney Malcolm described as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain Fran√ßois Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie. Amazon was back in the Atlantic in 1806, this time as part of Sir John Borlase Warren‚Äôs pursuit of Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez. When Warren's fleet unexpectedly encountered a separate French fleet under Charles-Alexandre L√©on Durand Linois, Amazon became involved in the resulting Action of 13 March 1806. During the battle she hunted down and captured the 40-gun French frigate in a running engagement. Amazon lost four killed and five wounded during the engagement, while Belle Poule lost six killed and 24 wounded. On 28 August 1807 Amazon and were in company at the capture of the Danish ship Speculation and so shared in the prize money for her. Amazon captured the privateer G√©n√©ral P√©rignon on 21 January 1810, after a chase of 160 miles. G√©n√©ral P√©rignon, of 14 guns and 83 men, had left Saint-Malo on 8 January and had captured the brig Unanimity, from Oporto.

History Founded by double bassist Ignacio Varchausky and bandoneonist Camilo Ferrero and starting off as a quintet, El Arranque developed a repertoire that was readily embraced by the tango community, and by the end of their first year El Arranque had already performed over 200 shows in Argentine theatres and milongas (tango dance halls). El Arranque's debut album, Tango (1998), was sponsored by two legendary figures of the tango world, Leopoldo Federico and Nelly Omar and brought national and international acclaim. In June‚ÄìJuly of that same year El Arranque embarked on their first tour to Europe, performing at Tangomania Summer Festival '98 in Bologna, Italy, in Berlin, Stuttgart and Dresden. In December, the orchestra was selected by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to play for the closing night of the first Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires with a large outdoor performance on Avenida Corrientes, which was turned into a milonga for the occasion. This event was a huge success for the orchestra and led the Argentine newspapers Clar√≠n and La Naci√≥nhttp://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=106920 to describe El Arranque as ‚Äúthe Tango revelation of the year‚Äù. 1999 saw the beginning of a second 2-month long European tour of 12 cities, including London, Paris, and Milan. In December, El Arranque was invited again to close the second Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires. By the year 2000 the group had established itself as the most important young tango orchestra in the world. In October of that same year El Arranque performed at Romaeuropa Festival in Rome, Italy for the Tango: Buenos Aires a Romahttp://www.romaeuropa.net/archivio/eventi/tango/index.html series of concerts. After performing in Lausanne and Padua El Arranque returned to Buenos Aires to record their second CD, Cabulero, sponsored by Jos√© Libertella, founder and director of the prestigious Sexteto Mayor. In January and February 2001, El Arranque toured fifteen cities in The Netherlands with the show Tango de Buenos Aires. In March they returned to Buenos Aires to premiere Cabulero, which also includes a music video as its last track. In May El Arranque performed in New York City with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, directed by Wynton Marsalis. These concerts included original music (Concerto Grosso, for seven tango musicians and a symphony orchestra, and Suite Borgeana, in seven movements) written for both orchestras by both Wynton Marsalis and by Ramiro Gallo, El Arranque's first violinist. In June the orchestra performed at the Th√©√¢tre national de Chaillot in Paris during the Buenos Aires Tango series of concerts. El Arranque ended 2001 with several other performances in Buenos Aires and two more European tours (Festival del Grec in Barcelona, Teatro Trinidade in Lisbon, Festival de Oto√±o in Madrid and various cities in Germany). From January to March 2002, El Arranque played 50 concerts in 40 Japanese cities and 10 in Taiwan on the famous Min-On Concert Association Tour.http://www.min-on.org/newsletter/200111/news/en02.html In April, the orchestra performed two concerts at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC for the Americartes Festival and returned to Buenos Aires to launch their third CD, Cl√°sicos. This CD has sold almost 10,000 copies in Argentina alone, becoming one of the tango best sellers of 2002. El Arranque travelled to Europe again in November 2002 to record their first live CD, En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza. The concert was held in the famous auditorium of Rete 2 Radio in Lugano, Switzerland. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and one with a full-colour book of photographs and quotes, packaged in a hard cover. The tour continued in Italy, Germany and London, with five concerts at Porchester Hall. In January 2003 El Arranque toured 10 cities in Norway under the auspices of the Norwegian Concert Institute. In February the orchestra took part in the fifth edition of the Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires, performing before 20,000 people in Avenida Corrientes. Meanwhile, El Arranque also performed once a week in Club del Vino, a music club in Buenos Aires. That same year the group took part in the production and recording of the new CD of tango singer Lidia Borda, Tal vez ser√° su voz, and in November toured Colombia for the first time. In March 2004, El Arranque won the Carlos Gardel Award for Best Tango Recording of 2003 with their live CD En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza. In June the orchestra was invited to take part in the 2004 Genova Tango Festival in Genoa, Italy. The special repertoire it prepared for the occasion included works by maestros N√©stor Marconi, Julio Pane, Ra√∫l Garello and Mauricio Marcelli, as invited soloists and composers, with special arrangements by Ramiro Gallo. This extraordinary intergenerational collaboration inspired El Arranque's fifth CD, Maestros. In November 2004http://www.oac.state.oh.us/News/NewsArticle.asp?intArticleId=146 El Arranque was invited to the USA to perform in the International Music and Performing Arts in Communities Tour (IMPACT), presented by the Ohio Arts Council (OAC) in partnership with the Ohio Arts Presenters Network (OAPN), Arts Midwest and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts with shows in Lancaster, Cleveland, Akron, Dayton, Cincinnati, Sandusky, Springfield, Urbana, Columbus, Newark and Dover in Ohio and in Erie, Allegheny Collegehttp://www.allegheny.edu/news/releases/orquesta_el_arranque.php in Meadville, and Franklin, Pennsylvania. The year ended with performances in Chile and Uruguay and the orchestra was nominated for the Latin Grammy awards. 2005 began with a new tour of Japan, organised once again by the Min On Association, in the wake of El Arranque's huge success in that country. In the space of two months they performed 46 concerts in such cities as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Sapporo. That same year El Arranque also toured Brazil for the first time, performing in important theatres such as Guair√£o in Curitiba and Canec√£o in Rio de Janeiro. The year ended with a series of concerts in the Sol√≠s theatre in Montevideo, Uruguay, performances within the framework of the Joventango Festival, and the opening of the Cultural Carnival of Valpara√≠so in Plaza Sotomayor in front of an audience of over 10,000 people. In June 2006 the orchestra took part once again in the Buenos Aires Tango III Festival in Chaillot National Theatre in Paris, and also performed again in Stuttgart. In September, El Arranque performed in the first Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome and in the Biennale de la Danse in Lyon. In December they celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a series of concerts in the club La Trastienda in Buenos Aires, with their colleagues Lidia Borda, Ariel Ardit, Ramiro Gallo and many more who had taken part in the project over the last decade. March 2007 saw their first trip to Hong Kong to take part in the 35th Hong Kong Arts Festival. They also received the Juan Canaro Prize as the revelation in tango of the last decade, awarded by SADAIC. The orchestra then took part for the second time in the XV Llao Llao Music Week in Bariloche.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=951323 In 2008, four years after the release of their last album, El Arranque premiered their sixth CD, Nuevos,http://www.buenosairesherald.com/PrintedEdition/View/9394 in the 25 de Mayo theatre in Buenos Aires. Its sixteen tracks feature the best original works by El Arranque's own musicians and colleagues of their generation. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and a full- colour hard cover boxed set featuring a snakes-and-ladders cum trivia type gamehttp://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1035695 inspired by El Arranque's various experiences in the world of tango during the last 12 years. The game features miniature cardboard cutouts of the various members of the group and a miniature die, as well as a trivia booklet. In September the orchestra travelled back to Rome to take part in the second edition of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica. On 30 November 2011 they won the Premio Gardel (Argentina) for Best Album of a Tango Orchestra with their new cd Raras Partituras 6, recorded with Leopoldo Federico.

In the accident, at least 27 patients were injured, and 11 of them died, according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All of the injured were cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. On 7 December 1990, a technician performed maintenance on an electron accelerator at the Clinic of Zaragoza. On 10 December, it returned to service after the repairs. On 19 December, the Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) was scheduled to make its annual review of the device, but due to bureaucratic reasons this review was delayed. The CSN found the electron accelerator power was too high. On 20 December 1990, the unit was stopped and was restarted on 8 March 1991. Chronology Affected patients immediately suffered burns on the skin of the irradiated area, as well as inflammation of the internal organs and bone marrow. The first patient died on 16 February 1991, two months after irradiation. Fatalities increased until, on 25 December 1991, the last of a total of 25 patients died. The IAEA established that 11 of the deaths were due to the faulty maintenance. The accident The radiotherapy unit was repaired without following the correct instructions. The unit, in service 14 years at the time of the failure, had a breakdown in the electron beam accelerator control system (\\"deviator\\"). Repairs incorrectly increased output power, so patients that should have received therapy at 7 MeV were instead treated at 40 MeV.

Autumn Stampex 2018 Spring Stampex 2019 Stampex is a twice yearly British stamp show held at the Business Design Centre (BDC) at Islington, London, every Spring and Autumn. The show is organised by the Philatelic Traders Society (PTS) through their company PTS Stamp and Coin Exhibitions Limited and has been running for many years. Elements of the show The show consists mainly of stands from stamp dealers who are members of the PTS but specialist philatelic societies often hold meetings at the BDC in conjunction with the show. Until recently competitive stamp exhibitions were also held. The Association of British Philatelic Societies (ABPS) has announced that they will be reintroduced with effect from the Autumn 2009 show. Other important parts of the show include a youth area run by the National Youth Stamp Group and a large stand from Britain's Royal Mail where recent British stamp issues are on sale. Souvenirs Admission is free of charge and visitors usually receive a modest philatelic souvenir of some kind. At the Spring 2009 show a postcard was given featuring unadopted artwork by stamp designer Jeffery Matthews for a proposed 1979 Welsh Assembly stamp issue. These souvenirs have become collectable. History Stampex has not always been at the BDC. For many years it was located at the Central Hall, Westminster when it was organised between the PTS and The Junior Philatelic Society (now the National Philatelic Society). The Jules Rimet trophy was stolen from Westminster Central Hall while exhibited as part of a \\"Sport with Stamps\\" display during Stampex in March 1966.  Other British shows  There is no other regular national show competing with Stampex in the UK, although many smaller shows take place and an FIP endorsed international show takes place in London every ten years, with the next being the London 2020 International Stamp Exhibition. The name has been adopted for stamp shows in other countries, for instance Hong Kong Stampex and Adelaide Stampex, however, none are connected with the British version.

It focuses on new music, commission and premiere works, and collaborates with various venues and instrumental ensembles. Consistently recognized in critical reviews, in 2014, the ensemble was hailed as \\"ardently angelic\\" by the Los Angeles TimesSwed, Mark (April 21, 2014). . Los Angeles Times. and \\"something of a miracle\\" by The Philadelphia Inquirer.Stearns, David Patrick (July 14, 2014). . The Philadelphia Inquirer. History Formed by a group of friends in 2005, the ensemble has since grown and according to The New York Times in 2014, \\"has made a name for itself in recent years as a champion of new music\\".Schweitzer, Vivian (February 21, 2014). . The New York Times. The choir was the resident choir of the Spoleto Festival, Italy, in 2007; appeared at Miller Theatre of Columbia University in the American premiere of James Dillon's Nine Rivers with the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE); joined Bang on a Can's first Philadelphia Marathon; and has appeared with the American Composers Orchestra, Network for New Music, Quicksilver Baroque, Lyric Fest, Piffaro, red fish blue fish, Tempesta di Mare Baroque Chamber Orchestra, PRISM Saxophone Quartet, Toshimaru Nakamura, Dolce Suono, and in the summer of 2013, The Rolling Stones. The ensemble has sung in venues including the Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; it made its Lincoln Center debut in July 2014 in a world premiere of a composition by John Luther Adams in a collaboration with the Mostly Mozart Festival, the Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival, eighth blackbird, JACK Quartet, and TILT Brass. The choir frequently commissions works and has presented over 70 world premieres. Projects for the 2017-18 season include commissions with Michael Gilbertson, Aaron Helgeson, Benjamin C.S. Boyle, and Kile Smith. The ensemble records extensively and has released ten recordings on various labels: Innova Recordings, Navona Records, Albany Records, ECM Records, and Cantaloupe Music. Its recording of Thomas Lloyd's Bonhoeffer was nominated for Best Choral Performance for the 59th Grammy Awards. The choir is the recipient of three ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming as well as the Dale Warland Singers Commission Award from Chorus America; conductor Donald Nally also received the 2012 Louis Botto Award for Innovative Action and Entrepreneurial Zeal and the 2017 Michael Korn Founders Award for Development of the Professional Choral Art for his work with the ensemble. In December 2014, the ensemble began a collaboration with visual artists Allora & Calzadilla in their largest U.S. exhibition to date, Intervals, at the Perelman Building at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and The Fabric Workshop and Museum. This included over 300 performances of David Lang's Lifespan as well as monthly performances of In the Midst of Things, a fifteen-minute unaccompanied re-imagining of moments from Franz Joseph Haydn's The Creation (1798). In June 2016, the organization launched an ambitious commissioning project called Seven Responses, the purpose of which was to perform Dieterich Buxtehude's Membra Jesu Nostri (BuxWV 75) juxtaposed with commissioned responses by Caroline Shaw, Hans Thomalla, Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, Anna Thorvaldsdottir. David T. Little, Santa Ratniece, and Lewis Spratlan, in collaboration with Quicksilver Baroque and International Contemporary Ensemble. The two-day program was premiered at the Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral and later reprised at Merkin Concert Hall as a part of the 2016 Mostly Mozart Festival in Lincoln Center. =Month of Moderns= In 2009, the ensemble established an annual festival, held in the early summer, consisting of several new-music concerts in one month, with commissioned works based on a central theme tying the entire festival together. The theme for Month of Moderns 2009 was The Celan Project, works based on the poetry of Paul Celan. Month of Moderns 2010 featured The Levine Project, works based on or inspired by the words of Pulitzer-Prize winner and U.S. Poet Laureate Philip Levine. \\"Seneca Sounds\\" was the focus for Month of Moderns 2011, with works based on the words and philosophy of Seneca the Younger. Month of Moderns 2012 was centered on Modern Vespers, works fashioned after the ancient evening prayer service, cast in modern themes and musical languages. A much larger project, The Gulf (Between You and Me), based on a three-part commissioned poem by Pierre Joris inspired by the Deep Water Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, dominated Month of Moderns 2013. Month of Moderns 2014 included five major commissioned world premieres loosely based around Novalis's poem Astralis questioning our existence and eternity. After 2014, the ensemble moved away from a theme solely surrounding the Month of Moderns alone and more towards a theme for each season. The Month of Moderns festival continues to be a signature part of the organization's season, regardless of theme, with each concert featuring at least one or more world premiere. =Death of co-founder Jeffrey Dinsmore= In April 2014, Crossing co-founder Jeffrey Dinsmore died at age 42; he was preparing for a rehearsal with The Crossing and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Disney Hall. The ensemble subsequently established The Jeffrey Dinsmore Memorial Fund. The Crossing later commissioned 15 composers who had a connection with Mr. Dinsmore to write short quartets to be published in a printed omnibus. The ensemble gave the world premiere of those works on July 8, 2016 in Philadelphia. =Big Sky Choral Initiative= In the summer of 2015, The Crossing partnered with the Warren Miller Performing Arts Center in Big Sky, Montana, to offer a week-long fellowship intensive for students of composition and choral singing. In 2017, the program expanded to two weeks, offering educational opportunities to conducting fellows as well. Composing, conducting, and singing fellows interact with members of The Crossing on a daily basis, exploring, writing, and singing new music throughout the week. The Big Sky Choral Initiative continued its creative journey with a new paradigm in 2018, collaborating with Michael Gordon (composer) and filmmaker Bill Morrison (director) to create a new work specific to this unique gathering at Big Sky. The work draws on the land of Montana - its history, beauty, struggles, and expanse - as inspiration for this hour-long work for unaccompanied choir and film. http://www.bigskyconservatory.org/big-sky- choral-initiative/ =Commissioned world premieres= * Kinan Abou-Afach: Of Nights and Solace (commissioned by Al-Bustan Seeds of Culture in collaboration with The Crossing, 2015) * John Luther Adams: Sila: The Breath of the World (commissioned by Mostly Mozart and Lincoln Center) (2014) * John Luther Adams: Canticles of the Holy Wind (2013) * Louis Andriessen: Ahania Weeping (Jeff Quartets 2016) * Benjamin C.S.

The two buildings are nearly twins, both with tezontle stone facades and white stone accents. The houses were founded by the family of Juan Guerrero de Luna in the 16th century, and stayed in the family all through the colonial period as a permanent grant of the Spanish Crown. The current appearance of the buildings is due to rebuilding which was realized in the late 18th century. After Independence, the two houses gradually fell out of family hands, with the main house serving various public functions and the smaller house becoming apartments and shops. History The two houses were founded in the 16th century by Juan Guerrero de Luna and his wife Beatriz Gomez Davila, after receiving a grant of the land to the family by Spanish king Felipe II. The land and houses would stay in the family all through the colonial period. The original structures were built in the 16th century, but what remains now was a rebuilding of the houses done near the end of the 18th century by architect Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres. The western house was the one that the family lived in, with the east house reserved to house domestic staff as well as storage. Areas here were also rented to merchants. While the two buildings look similar, the western house contains most of the distinctive features. By the end of the 19th century, the eastern, or servants‚Äô house was already converted into apartments and stores. Artist Jos√© Guadalupe Posada lived and worked in this building from the end of the 19th century until his death in 1913 after losing his former studios. Living and working here allowed him to observe the daily lives of ordinary people, which was reflected in his work from this time. In 1914, the main house became the site of the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico and would remain in the building for about thirty years. While the main house may have been quite large as a home, it was considered a bit small to house a school, with the only place to put a basketball court being one of the two interior patios. In 1933, Rufino Tama√±o painted a fresco here, dedicated to music, especially singing, for the Conservatory. The Conservatory is now located in the Polanco neighborhood. In the 1980s, the main house was being used by the Dept of Prehistory of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, with the servants‚Äô building accommodating shops and apartments. The main building today belongs to the Secretariat of Public Education with the servants‚Äô building still occupied by tenants and merchants. Description The main house lacks many of the spectacular architectural details that distinguish other residences such as the Palace of Iturbide, but it does have a number of interesting elements. This building has two floors with a parapet at one corner of the property. The facade is of tezontle, a blood-red porous volcanic stone, with the windows, balconies, doorways and baseboards of the building done in chiluca, a grayish-white stone. Many of the relieves on the building, especially the parapet, pay homage to the Virgin Mary. Her image appears here and the corner pilasters are decorated with relieves of lilies and roses which are associated with her. On the upper floor, there are two square compartments: one with a fountain and one with a well. The parapet has a niche with an image of the Virgin, flanked by two semi-detached estipite (inverted truncated pyramid) columns with Corinthian capitals formed by acanthus leaves. This was very common to the religious architecture of the Counter Reformation period as they allude to eternity and the glory of the Virgin Mary. The parapet is also decorated with an ivory tower design and a palm tree framed by elaborate Baroque mouldings. Inside, the building has two patios with independent entrances to the street as well as a doorway that connect them to each other In the main stairwell is a fresco done by Rufino Tama√±o from 1933 which is dedicated to music. House of the Sun and Moon However, the most distinctive decoration of the house is outside and gives the house the alternate name of ‚ÄúHouses of the Sun and Moon.‚Äù They are reliefs of the sun and the moon on the corner that is at the intersection of Moneda and Correo Mayor Streets. These, too, are a reference to the Virgin Mary, as she is said to be ‚Äúas beautiful as the moon and as bright as the sun.‚Äù However, these images, as well as the names of the family associated with the property have given rise to a legend as to their existence. This legend says that there was a viceroy, who was quite fond of wild parties, inviting the highest-class families of New Spain. This viceroy gave the wife of Don Enrique de Luna, Do√±a Sol de Olmedo, a sumptuous mansion located very close to the Viceroy's Palace as a token of appreciation for their ‚Äúplatonic‚Äù relationship. Luna became jealous over the gift and, according to the story, had the house completely demolished to its foundations. He then built in its place a new and even more sumptuous house there for his wife. Furthermore, to show to her that their names were forever linked, he had the reliefs of the sun (‚Äúsol‚Äù means sun) and moon (‚Äúluna‚Äù means moon) at the corner where the two main facades meet. This action caused the viceroy to permanently break off his relationship with the couple.

Background The great-grandparents of T. A. S. Adams, as he was generally called, were Welsh-Irish Presbyterians, who emigrated from Ireland to South Carolina in 1766. Abram Adams, his father, moved with his wife and five children, in 1834, to Noxubee County, Mississippi, and bought a tract of land from the Indians. Ten out of the fourteen children in this thrifty, intelligent, religious family lived to the age of twenty-one. Among them was T. A, S. Adams, born February 5, 1839, and named for a general under whom his father served in the War of 1812. From the neighborhood school he entered, with marked literary aptitude, the University of Mississippi and completed the Junior year, graduating with honors at Emory and Henry College, Virginia, in 1860. The same year he married, and entered the Methodist ministry. He was chaplain of the 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment under General Joseph R. Davis in the Confederate Army. Transferring in 1871 from the Mobile Conference, which he had joined, to the North Mississippi Conference, formed that year, he soon ranked among the leaders in the Conference, filling important stations and at intervals appointed to the presidency of several church schools. He was among the first, and earnest, advocates of a Mississippi Methodist College. His epic poem, Enscotidion; or, Shadow of Death, was published in 1876. Aunt Peggy and Other Poems appeared in 1882, in which year he was a delegate from his Conference to the General Conference of the Southern Methodist Church. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by his alma mater in 1884. In 1886, he became president of Centenary College of Louisiana (Jackson), but resigned the next year and moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where he established a school with the design of having it become the \\"State Methodist College\\". But his plans miscarried, and he reentered the itinerant ministry in the North Mississippi Conference. He died suddenly, from a stroke of apoplexy, December 21, 1888, in the railway station at Jackson, Mississippi, while preparing to leave for his new appointment at Oxford, Mississippi.

He has authored 10 volumes of poetry, most recently, Lovers of the Lost: New & Selected Poems (Godine, 2010), The Lost Child: Ozark Poems (Godine, 2014), The Unfastening (Godine, 2017), and Dwellers in the House of the Lord (Godine, 2020). He has also written three books of prose, including a memoir, The Words I Chose: A Memoir of Family and Poetry (Carnegie Mellon \\"Poets in Prose\\" Series, 2013). In addition, he has edited several anthologies of Maine writing, and served as a guest editor in poetry for the 2010 Pushcart Prize Annual. A New Hampshire native who has lived for many years in Mercer, Maine, McNair received his undergraduate degree from Keene State College and has earned two degrees from Middlebury College, an MA in English, and an M.Litt. in American literature. He has also studied American literature, art, and history at Dartmouth College, sponsored by a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship. As of 2018, McNair is professor emeritus and writer in residence at the University of Maine at Farmington.USA Fellows 2006 > Wesley McNair Bio  Work  According to United States Artists, Wesley McNair's poetry often deals with \\"the struggles of the economic misfits of his native New England, often with humor and through the use of telling details.\\"USA Fellows 2006 > Wesley McNair Bio In his memoir The Words I Chose, McNair refers to the region of his poetry as \\"a place of farmers under threat, ethnic shop workers, traders, and misfits at the margins\\" and his exploration of \\"their American dreams, failures, self-doubts, and restlessness.\\"The Words I Chose: A Memoir of Family and Poetry (Carnegie Mellon University Press), page 58 He adds to these themes, love and its absence, loss and disability, and the precarious bonds of family and community. At the center of McNair's poems and his memoir is his family and extended family, whose conflicts recur throughout his several collections, forming a narrative of their own. His literary family, underprivileged and post-industrial, is at odds with those of earlier New England poets. He explains in his essay \\"Placing Myself\\" that whereas \\"a poet like Robert Lowell features a New England family of pedigree connected to the history of high culture...my own poetry family is lower class, consisting of mongrels whose history is largely unknown.\\" He continues: \\"Where Donald Hall skips a generation to write about his grandfather and the agrarian tradition he represents, I write about a broken family with no real patriarch and no clear tradition.\\" Mapping the Heart: Reflections on Place and Poetry (Carnegie Mellon University Press), page 5. The struggles of his family poems and others often link with national themes, as in his long narrative poem \\"My Brother Running,\\" in which he links his younger brother's fatal heart attack, following months of desperate running, with the tragic explosion of NASA's Challenger shuttle. In his recent collection, The Lost Child: Ozark Poems (Godine, 2014), he moves from New England to the Ozarks of southern Missouri, where his mother grew up, though he does not leave behind his earlier concerns about family, community, and America. The core characters of the book, derived from his mother and her siblings, are part of a forgotten American generation who grew up in the poverty and hardship of the Dust Bowl period. In Dwellers in the House of the Lord (Godine, 2020)‚ÄîMcNair‚Äôs tenth poetry collection‚Äîhe writes about rural Virginia, where his sister Aimee struggles with a failing marriage to Mike, the owner of an off-the-grid gun shop. The book-length narrative poem explores his family's immigrant origins and links Aimee's story with the ugly politics of the Trump era. McNair's ten volumes of poetry, inspired by region, American popular culture, and the broad human experience, include a wide range of meditations, lyrics and narratives. As critics and interviewers have remarked, his poems are attuned to the cadences and suggestions of American speech. Honors and awards McNair has received two Rockefeller Fellowships for creative work at the Bellagio Center in Italy, two National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Among his other honors are the Theodore Roethke Prize, The Jane Kenyon Award for Outstanding Book of Poetry, the Devins Award for Poetry, the Eunice Tietjens Prize from Poetry magazine, and the Sarah Josepha Hale MedalPoetry Foundation > Poet: Wesley McNair (1941 -- ) for his \\"distinguished contribution to the world of letters.\\" McNair has served five times on the jury for the Pulitzer Price in Poetry. In 2006, McNair was selected for a United States Artists Fellowship. From 2011 to 2016 McNair served as the Poet Laureate of Maine, sponsoring five statewide poetry initiatives. According to Meg Haskell in the Bangor Daily News on September 30, 2017, his goal was \\"to demystify poetry and make it more accessible to all Maine people.\\" Quoting McNair, Haskell continues: \\"The best poems are after insights into the shared human life. They tell us what life is about. What's in it,\\" and \\"What matters in it.\\" McNair adds that poetry's insights come from intuition, the \\"truest part of you. The smartest part.\\" In 2015, McNair was the recipient of the PEN New England Award for Literary Excellence in Poetry, given for The Lost Child: Ozark Poems. Publishing history McNair's poems have appeared widely in literary journals and magazines including AGNI, The American Poetry Review, The Atlantic, The Gettysburg Review, Green Mountain Review, The Iowa Review, The Kenyon Review, Michigan Quarterly Review, Mid-American Review, The New Criterion, New England Review, Pleiades, Ploughshares, Poetry, Poetry Northwest, Prairie Schooner, Sewanee Review, Slate, The Virginia Quarterly Review, Witness, and Yankee Magazine.Author Website Featured more than 20 times on The Writer's Almanac with Garrison Keillor, and on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition (Saturday and Sunday programs), McNair's work has also appeared in the Pushcart Prize Annual, two editions of The Best American Poetry, and over sixty anthologies and textbooks.AGNI Online Wesley McNair Bio & Poem Bibliography A selection of 25 of his poems are featured on the website of the Poetry Foundation. Critical praise In an extensive review of McNair's new and selected poems, Lovers of the Lost, in The Harvard Review Kevin T. O'Connor said the book demonstrated \\"a defining imagination,\\" comparing his poems favorably to the poetry of Robert Lowell, James Wright, Robert Frost, and Seamus Heaney. Robin Becker, writing the judge's citation for McNair's 2015 collection, The Lost Child: Ozark Poems, which won the PEN New England Award for poetry, said: \\"Wesley McNair harnesses the timeless power of the epic poem to tell the necessary stories of our human tribe...The colloquial music in these poems will move readers to laughter and tears.\\" Writing on McNair's collection The Ghosts of You and Me for the literary journal Ploughshares in the winter of 2009-2007, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Philip Levine called McNair \\"one of the great storytellers of contemporary poetry.\\" In the same journal in the fall of 2002, Maxine Kumin, the United States Poet Laureate from 1981 to 1982, called McNair \\"a master craftsman, with a remarkable ear.\\" In a 1989 review that appeared in the Harvard Review, Donald Hall, who served as the United States Poet Laureate from 2006 to 2007, remarked, \\"Because he is a true poet, his New England is unlimited. Whole lives fill small lines, real to this poet, therefore to us.\\" In the summer of 2002, the Ruminator Review wrote of McNair's book Fire that the poet has created \\"one of the most individual and original bodies of work by a poet of his generation.\\" Collected papers McNair's extensive papers were purchased by Colby College in 2006. Taking up approximately 100 linear feet in the college library's Special Collections, the Wesley McNair Papers include: *Scrapbooks, photographs, family letters, clippings and ephemera *Early writings (elementary through high school) *Notebooks with graduate school writings, teaching notes and poem drafts *Manuscript drafts, first appearances and audio/visual recordings *Extensive correspondence (Maine Times colleagues, Donald Hall, literary peers) *A video of McNair giving a slide presentation and talk about his papers, entitled My Life as a Poet. In 2010, Colby College's Special Collections Librarian Patricia Burdick launched an innovative new Web site that utilizes McNair's poetry to increase understanding of and appreciation for the making of poetry. The interactive site includes audio recordings and manuscript samples to show the development of selected poems. The site is accompanied by teaching and learning tools. In 2014, McNair's site at Colby launched Letters Between Poets, featuring his correspondence with a mentor, Donald Hall, during his early struggles as a poet. The online correspondence may be accessed by chapters, themes, poems in progress, and a keyword search. Bibliography Poetry collections *Dwellers in the House of the Lord (David R.

Charles Gervin Hayden, Jr. 3 February 1938) is an American author, activist and blogger. After involvement in the early homophile and gay liberation movements, Wicker became active around the issue of human cloning. Early life and LGBT activism Wicker was born Charles Gervin Hayden, Jr. in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1938.D'Emilio, p. 158 He was raised in Florida by his grandparents.Hogan and Hudson, p. 574 His first exposure to the homophile movement came while he was a student at the University of Texas at Austin in the mid-1950s, when he discovered a copy of the ONE, Inc. magazine One.Eisenbach, p. 33 Wicker affiliated himself with the New York City chapter of the homophile Mattachine Society (MSNY) in 1958, while still a UT student, spending the summer in the city to work with the organization. Mattachine took a conservative stance in its work for homosexual rights and Wicker, who was younger than the leadership and many of the other members, joined with other younger activists like MSNY vice president Craig Rodwell in an effort to make the group more radical.Miller, p. 349 \\"He was, let's say, a disturbing acquisition for the movement\\", recalled then-MSNY president Arthur Maule.quoted in Loughery, p. 250 After convincing MSNY that it should begin publicizing its events, Wicker printed up flyers for an upcoming lecture, leading to a standing-room-only crowd. It also led police to persuade MSNY's landlord to evict the group from its recently occupied headquarters.Carter, p. 23 As he became more active in the movement, Wicker apprised his family of his activities. Hayden, Sr., while skeptical that his activities would amount to anything, asked him not to use \\"Charles Hayden\\" for his activism. He adopted the pseudonym \\"Randolfe Hayden Wicker\\", retaining his family name as his new middle name to maintain the family connection. He legally changed his name in 1967. Returning to Austin in the fall of 1958, Wicker tried to start a homophile organization called Wicker Research Studies. WRS adopted the philosophy of the San Francisco-based lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis and operated across Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. WRS was short-lived, however, as Mississippi denied the organization's application for incorporation.Howard, p. 232 He also became active in the civil rights movement. Wicker ran for student body president but during the campaign the dean received notification that Wicker and his roommate Edward Lacey were gay.Fraser Sutherland, Lost Passport: The Life and Words of Edward Lacey. BookLand Press, 2011. . This helped convince him that homosexuals needed to engage in militant action. Upon graduating from UT-Austin, Wicker relocated permanently to New York City and renewed his ties with MSNY. Stifled from radical actions under the purview of MSNY, Wicker created the \\"Homosexual League of New York\\" in 1962, a front organization that existed, largely on paper, to allow Wicker distance from MSNY to operate. When WBAI radio broadcast a panel of psychiatrists who espoused the sickness theory of homosexuality, Wicker persuaded the station manager to put him and several other openly gay people on the air to \\"rap\\" about their lives, because \\"homosexuals were the real authority on homosexuality.\\" A week before the broadcast, Jack O'Brian, a \\"right-wing\\" columnist for the New York Journal American, attacked it as an attempt to present \\"the ease of living the gay life.\\" Wicker made the rounds to Variety, Newsweek, and The New York Times informing them of the broadcast and the attack on it by O'Brian. The 90-minute program, believed to be the first such in the United States, aired in July, 1962.Loughery, p. 268 Several mainstream media outlets, alerted by Wicker, covered the broadcast, which received favorable treatment in The New York Times, The Realist, Newsweek, the New York Herald Tribune, and Variety.Carter, p. 25 As a result of the publicity, from 1962 through 1964 Wicker was one of the most visible homosexuals in New York. He spoke to countless church groups and college classes and, in 1964, became the first openly gay person to appear on East Coast television with a January 31 appearance on The Les Crane Show. Wicker is credited with organizing the first known gay rights demonstration in the United States. Wicker, along with Rodwell, sexual freedom activist Jefferson Fuck Poland and a handful of others, picketed the Whitehall Street Induction Center in New York City in 1964 after the confidentiality of gay men's draft records was violated.Campbell, p. xvii In 1965 he ran for the office of secretary for MSNY as an independent. He lost, but a slate of radicals whose views aligned with his swept the elections, effectively taking control of the organization.Carter, p. 39 He supported himself by operating, with his lover Peter Ogren, Underground Uplift Unlimited, a slogan-button and head shop. The couple ran the shop from 1967 to 1971, and used the proceeds to open an antique and lighting store. Wicker ran his store for 29 years. Wicker was a witness to the Stonewall riots in June, 1969, which are recognized as the start of the modern gay liberation movement. He later recalled seeing rioters set bonfires and throw garbage barrels through the windows of Greenwich Village businesses. \\"All I could think was, Oh my God, they're going to burn up a little old Italian lady or some child is going to be killed and we're going to be the bogey-man of the seventies.\\"Quoted in Kaiser, pp. 199‚Äì200 Despite his early activism, Wicker denounced the riots at a community organizational meeting a week later, saying that \\"throwing rocks through windows doesn't open doors\\" and dismissing \\"disorderly\\" behaviour as a means to social tolerance.Duberman, pp. 215‚Äì16Wicker would later regret his words, calling them one of the biggest mistakes of his life (Clendenin and Nagourney, p. 27). He temporarily distanced himself from the gay movement, but returned by writing in 1970 for Gay, a tabloid magazine,Carter, photo. 242 and again in 1972 to lend his name as co-author The Gay Crusaders, a compilation of profiles of early movement leaders, with Kay Lahusen (writing under the name \\"Kay Tobin\\") though Lahusen, who was uncomfortable with public speaking, wrote it all and Wicker simply agreed to do promotion of the book. Wicker joined the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA), a more structured activist group that formed in response to what was seen as the excesses of the Gay Liberation Front. GLF tended to split its focus amongst many different left-oriented political activities, including opposition to the Vietnam War and support for the Black Panthers. GAA members wanted to concentrate their energies exclusively on gay rights issues. As a member of GAA, Wicker participated in a series of zaps, occupation-style actions. Wicker sometimes covered these events for gay media outlets like Gay and The Advocate.Clendenin and Nagourney, p. 144 Since 2009, he has been documenting and participating in the Radical Faerie communities in Tennessee and New York. Cloning activist With the announcement of the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996, Wicker became an advocate for human cloning. He formed the activist Cloning Rights United Front,Hogan and Hudson, p. 575 and argued that the right to bear one's \\"later-born identical twin\\" was not only an LGBT rights issue, but a human rights issue. He sought unsuccessfully to convince Stephen Hawking to preserve genetic material for future cloning.Alexander, p. 175 As a part of its mission statement, CRUF adopted the \\"Clone Bill of Rights\\": > #Every person's DNA is his or her personal property. To have that DNA cloned > into another extended life is part and parcel of his or her right to control > his or her own reproduction. #Constitutionally, that right is assigned to > neither state legislatures, nor to the federal government, nor to religious > authorities. It is \\"reserved\\" to each and every citizen, to decide if, how > and when to reproduce. #Research, not rhetoric, and/or freedom-limiting > legal restrictions, is the only way to discover the real effects of cloning. > Restrictions on research into cloning of humans should not even be > considered unless real social harm can be demonstrated.

Sunshine Valley, formerly named Tashme, is an unincorporated community consisting of cabins, tiny homes, and RV parks on the Crowsnest Highway between of the town of Hope (NW) and the entrance to Manning Park in the Cascade Mountains of British Columbia. The community has its own volunteer fire department (SVVFD), recreation centre, heated outdoor pool, and playground. As of 2016, the population of Sunshine Valley is 177.  History  During World War II it was used as a Japanese Canadian internment camp. Opened September 8, 1942 it was designed to house 500 families, making it one of the largest and last camps in B.C., and was located just outside the 100 mile \\"quarantine\\" zone from which all Japanese Canadians were removed. Men housed in the camp were employed in the construction of the highway during the war. After the war, the site was sold off and has continued in existence as a proposed Boy's Town, the Allison Lumber Company (a combined lumber and mine venture) and then a small campground and recreational community, and served as the basetown for the small Silvertip Ski Area which was located at the head of Tearse Creek, a tributary of the Upper Sumallo River which flows north into the town from the south and upon entering the town, turns southeast and enters Manning Park. In Hope, there is a Tashme Friendship Garden in memory of the camp and its residents.

On November 8, 1961, the aircraft crashed as it attempted to land at Byrd Field, near Richmond, Virginia. This was the second deadliest accident in American history for a single civilian aircraft. The accident was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which attributed the cause to numerous errors committed by the flight crew, as well as poor management and improper maintenance by the airline. The CAB concluded that the \\"flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming the responsibility for the job they presumed to do.\\" Aircraft Flight 201/8 was operated by Imperial Airlines using a Lockheed Constellation L-049 four-engine propliner (registration ' (c/n 1976). The aircraft was manufactured in April 1946, and first acquired by Imperial in May 1961. The aircraft had logged 32,589 hours of operating time immediately prior to the accident flight. Flight crew The Lockheed Constellation L-049, like many airliners of its era, was normally crewed by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) in the left seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer in the rear seat. The accident flight crewing was unusual in several respects. The pilot-in-command on Flight 201/8 was Ronald H. Conway, a captain first hired by Imperial Airlines in March 1960. Conway had 4,433 hours of flying time prior to the accident, including 293 hours on the L-049. Conway's first officer was James A. Greenlee, a qualified captain with more airline seniority and flight experience (17,841 hours, including 352 hours on the L-049) than Conway. Although Greenlee was the more senior captain, it was agreed between them prior to the flight that Conway would act as captain, and Greenlee would act as copilot. According to his post-accident testimony, Conway occupied the left (captain's) seat for the duration of Flight 201/8. The aircraft's flight engineer was William F. Poythress, who was first issued a flight engineer's certificate on the L-049 in September 1961. He had accumulated approximately 200 hours of flying time in the L-049 prior to the accident. However, Conway testified after the accident that student flight engineer Peter E. Clark actually served as flight engineer and occupied the flight engineer's seat for the duration of the flight. Poythress, as the only other surviving crew member, denied Conway's claim. While both crew members agreed that Clark occupied the flight engineer's seat for the initial segments of the flight, Poythress testifed that he, not Clark, occupied the flight engineer's seat during their takeoff from Baltimore, Maryland, a scheduled intermediate stop. As would emerge in later testimony at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to confusion in the cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as pilot in command, and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer. Flight history The four-engined chartered propliner departed Columbia, South Carolina, at 15:14 Eastern Standard Time (EST), en route to Newark, New Jersey as its first stop. Upon departing Columbia, the No. 3 engine experienced a drop in fuel pressure. Poythress was at this time monitoring Clark, who as trainee was occupying the flight engineer's seat. Poythress asked Clark what he was going to do, and Clark said that he would open the crossfeed valves between the No. 3 and No. 4 engines to ensure positive fuel pressure on the right side of the aircraft. Poythress did not inform the captain of the drop in fuel pressure or the opening of crossfeed valves, and the crossfeed valves were closed once the Lockheed reached its cruising altitude of 9,500 feet. The flight landed in Newark at 17:37, where it picked up its first group of 26 passengers. It departed Newark at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers, departing for Columbia, South Carolina at 20:30. According to his later testimony, during takeoff from each location, Poythress opened the cross feed valves between the No. 3 and No. 4 engines, to prevent the drop in fuel pressure seen while departing Columbia. During the final flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the fuel pressure warning lights for the No. 3 and 4 engines came on, and the plane began to yaw to the right. Poythress, who had testified he was in the flight engineer's chair during takeoff, had given the flight engineer's seat to Clark by this time. Clark yelled to Poythress about the fuel pressure warning lights, and Poythress assumed the flight engineer's seat. The No. 3 engine stopped rotating, and the No. 4 engine was surging between 1,500 and 2,000 RPM. Conway told Poythress, \\"You've got a fuel problem,\\" and Poythress opened all crossfeed valves and turned on all fuel boost pumps, trying to restore fuel flow to the engines. Poythress shut down engine No. 4 and tried to restart No. 3. Poythress sent Clark to the passenger cabin to open the midship fuel crossfeed valve. Clark returned to the cockpit, stating that he needed a screwdriver to open the valve. According to Poythress, Greenlee then interrupted Poythress and Clark's efforts, telling them not to disturb the midship valve because he wanted to preserve positive fuel pressure on the still-operating engine Nos. 1 and 2. Conway denied knowledge of this conversation after the accident, and believed the midship valve had been opened. Efforts by Poythress to restart the No. 3 engine were unsuccessful, and Poythress told Conway that he did not believe he could restart either left-side engine, and that he recommended landing the airplane. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which continued to operate normally), Conway decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution. The crew did not expect a crash landing, and did not advise the flight attendants to give emergency evacuation instrucitons. Crash CAB report At 21:10, Flight 201/8 contacted the Richmond controller, and was advised all runways were available. Greenlee (who was handling radio communications at the time) requested the airport have emergency vehicles on standby as a precaution. Conway then asked Greenlee to fly the aircraft, so that Conway could go back to and check on the flight engineer's station. With Greenlee flying, Conway advised the Richmond controller that they would circle and land on Runway 33, and that the aircraft had a \\"healthy airspeed.\\" According to Conway, Greenlee then suddenly remarked, \\"let's use this runway,\\" turned the aircraft toward Runway 2, and lowered the landing gear handle. Seeing the runway, Conway believed they were too high and too fast for Runway 2. In addition, the plane's landing gear stayed up despite Greenlee lowering the handle; in the L-049, hydraulic power to the landing gear could supplied by either of the plane's two right-side engines, Nos. 3 or 4, which were both shut down. Conway looked down at the landing gear lights, which were not illuminated, and yelled, \\"Landing gear is not down.\\" The crew's initial attempts to troubleshoot the landing gear failed, and the pilots realized the landing would need to be abandoned. Conway and Greenlee both called for full power on engines Nos. 1 and 2 in order to abort the landing and go around to Runway 33. Conway later testified that he believed the aircraft still had sufficient speed and altitude to go around and make Runway 33, but they would need to make a right turn to line up for the runway. The Richmond controller heard one of Flight 201/8's pilots say, \\"Tower, get everybody off [the runway]. We're losing another one here and we can't get our gear down.\\" Conway took over the controls for the start of the right turn, but lost sight of the airport, and turned control over to Greenlee, who could see the runway out of the right side of the aircraft. A continuous right turn brought the airplane around until Conway could see Runway 33 again. Poythress called out that they were losing power on engine No. 1. Applying full emergency power to the two remaining engines resulted in an over-boost in the No. 1 engine (outboard on the left side), which caused a complete internal failure and destroyed the engine. With loss of the No. 1 engine, Flight 201/8 was left with only one functioning engine, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and inevitable stall. At 21:24, the aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. Poythress opened the cockpit's door to the cabin, and the cockpit immediately filled with smoke. Poythress opened a crew exit door on the right side of the cockpit, while Conway opened a sliding window and used it to exit the aircraft. Conway later testified that the aircraft was completely engulfed in flames as soon as Conway got clear of it. Conway did not believe anyone else could have gotten clear of the plane. All 74 passengers and three crew members died. Two crew members (Conway and Poythress) were the only survivors. The grouping of passengers' bodies indicated that many survived the initial impact, and left their seats in an attempt to evacuate. The largest group of bodies was found near the main cabin entrance door, which was jammed shut by the ground impact or trees and debris. There were no apparent impact-related injuries, and all fatalities were attributed to suffocation due to carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the fire and smoke. Investigation The accident was investigated by the CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action as long as the engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.The flight engineer denied in his testimony that he had left the cross feed valves and boost pumps on during cruise flight, but the CAB discounted his testimony based on the preponderance of the other testimony and evidence. Wreckage of Imperial Airlines Flight 201/8 photographed by CAB The CAB concluded that, had proper fuel management procedures been followed, all engines would have kept running normally, or even restarted once they shut down. The Constellation crew, however, mismanaged the fuel flow to the right side engines, causing them to shut down, and were unable to restart them. During the ensuing precautionary landing which resulted in the crash, additional flight crew mistakes were highlighted by the CAB investigators, who were highly critical of Imperial Airlines management, maintenance and flying procedures. The CAB's final report stated: The CAB issued the following Probable Cause statement: Aftermath Senate Aviation Subcommittee Chairman A. S. Mike Monroney urged the Civil Aeronautics Board for a sweeping probe of the supplemental carrier industry as a result of the Imperial Airways crash. After the accident, it was revealed that Imperial Airlines had been fined in 1959 for \\"flying 30 marines in an 'unairworthy' C-46,\\" and in 1953, under its previous name of \\"Regina Cargo Airlines\\", 19 soldiers had been killed in a crash near Centralia, Washington, while being transported in a Douglas DC-3 owned by the company. Time news magazine reported that statistically the \\"nonskeds\\" in general were \\"more than 30 times as dangerous\\" in the number of fatalities per passenger mile as the scheduled airlines in 1961. According to Time, the U.S. military had been effectively forced to rely on nonskeds such as Imperial Airlines to carry troops within the U.S. because of the combination of two laws. First, the Congress had mandated the use of civilian air carriers (for economic reasons); and second, the Pentagon was obligated to bid for such services and select the lowest bidder, which often turned out to be financially unsound companies with a poor safety record. As a result of the accident, the Congress became concerned about the safety practices of the nonskeds, or \\"supplemental carriers.\\" The chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, A. S. Mike Monroney immediately sent a telegram to the CAB, urging a sweeping probe of the supplemental carrier industry. By 1962, Congress passed a law requiring all supplemental carriers to re-apply for certification by the CAB, to carry liability insurance and to maintain \\"a healthier financial status.\\" The new rules caused some 20 nonskeds to go out of business, but within five years the industry was booming again, partly due to the troop and equipment carrying needs of the Vietnam War.

It was redesignated an urban district in 1919, and in 1920 it was renamed Wolverton. It initially consisted of the following civil parishes: * Calverton * Stony Stratford East * Stony Stratford West * Wolverton In 1919 New Bradwell parish was added to the district. In 1927 Calverton, Stony Stratford East and Stony Stratford West were abolished as part of the Wolverton (Union of Parishes) Confirmation Order and the Wolverton parish was extended to cover these areas. New Bradwell was abolished as part of a county review order in 1934 and the area of the urban district and civil parish of Wolverton became coterminous. Following the Local Government Act 1972, the district was abolished in 1974. Its former area became part of the new district of Milton Keynes.

It is a choral symphony,Wilson, New Grove (2001), 24:848. written for contralto, countertenor, tenor and bass, plus chorus and orchestra. The symphony was written in homage to 19th century Austrian composer and organist Anton Bruckner, who was closely associated with St. Florian's Priory in the town of Sankt Florian, Upper Austria, and who is buried under the organ there.Moody, New Grove (2001), 22:566. Movements The symphony is written in six movements, structured after the Ordinary of the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church, and lasts approximately 60 minutes. # Kyrie # Gloria # Credo # Crucifixus # Sanctus--Benedictus # Agnus Dei Instrumentation Schnittke biographer Alexander Ivashkin writes, \\"The Symphony is written for a large orchestra consisting of double the standard number of woodwinds, 4 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 1 tuba, an extensive range of percussion instruments, piano, harpsichord, organ, celesta, 2 harps, an electric guitar and a bass guitar. The mixed chorus is a chamber one, including four soloists of each voice.\\"Ivashkin, notes for Chandos 9519, 5-6. Overview In 1977, Schnittke visited the West as a harpsichordist with the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra. During this trip, he visited St. Florian's Monastery near Linz, where Bruckner had played the organ and was buried. Ivashkin writes, \\"Entering the cloister in the twilight [Schnittke] heard the sound of monks singing an evening 'invisible' mass. This made a vivid impression on him. Two years later when Gennady Rozhdestvensky commissioned a work from Schnittke for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the composer was to write his Second Symphony or Invisible Mass.\\"Ivashkin, Schnittke, 140-141. Compared to the extroverted polystylism of the First Symphony, the Second displays a more \\"thoroughgoing absorption of [its] diverse musical sources.\\" The symphony works on two levels almost simultaneously. While soloists and a choir perform the mass, set to chorales taken from the Gradual, the orchestra provides a running commentary that sometimes follows a particular chorale but more often is \\"rather free and extensive\\" in style. \\"Yet musically almost all these sections blend the choral [sic] tune and subsequent extensive orchestral 'commentary.'\\"Ivashkin, notes for Chandos 9519, 5. The work becomes what Schnittke called an \\"Invisible Mass,\\"As cited in Ivanskin, notes to Chandos 9519, 5. something Alexander Ivashkin termed \\"a symphony against a chorale backdrop.\\" References Bibliography * Ivashkin, Alexander, Alfred Schnittke (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1996). . * Ivashkin, Alexander, notes to Chandos 9519, Schnittke: Symphony No. 2, \\"St. Florian\\"; Marina Katsman, contralto; Yaroslav Zdorov, countertenor; Oleg Dorgov, tenor; Sergei Veprintsev, bass; Russian State Symphonic Capella and Russian State Symphony Orchestra conducted by Valery Polyansky (Colchester: Chandos Records Ltd., 1997). * Sadie, Stanley (ed.).

The plot is about three teenagers and their sudden involvement with murder and violence over the course of a dangerous week. It won awards at film festivals in Austin and Melbourne, including a tie for the Best Film of 2008 award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.  Plot  James and Mark are teenagers in their final year of school and victims of Gary Parker, who raped them when they were younger. They still live in fear of him after he is released from prison for this crime. A brain damaged teenage girl named Tanya who has gone missing is run down by a car and killed while walking in a pine forest. Later, wandering alone in the forest, Mark secretly witnesses a man burying a body. The two friends decide to go dig up the grave to see what was buried, bringing along James' girlfriend Chasely. To their horror, they partly uncover the body of a young girl and beside her is a small Canadian flag, implying she is a Canadian backpacker. After an aborted attempt at reporting the body to the police, they search for the presumed killer from Mark's knowledge of the vehicle as he saw it driving away from the forest. They place the Canadian flag on his four-wheel drive and then the two boys secretly enter his house. They find out his name is Ian Wright and see a picture of him with a woman and baby, presumably his wife and child. They later phone him and try to blackmail him into killing Gary Parker. Ian finds Gary and sees him going into a club, as he's leaving he is bashed by two men who tell Ian it was \\"for what he did\\". Ian helps him back into his car and holds a gun to his head and asks him to explain about \\"the kids\\" who want him dead. He forces Gary to find the teenagers and hunt them with his dog and crossbow. Ian follows them and shoots Gary's barking dog. Mark is shot with the crossbow, but eventually manages to beat Gary to death with a rock. Just as Ian is about to shoot Mark, Chasely comes up behind him and hits him in the back with a pole, allowing the three to escape. They go back home to treat Mark's wound. James goes out on his own and is captured by Ian. Later, Mark wakes up to see that Chasely has gone to find James. Mark receives a call from Ian to meet up with him and sees he is accompanied by Petra, a female backpacker from Norway. The killer taunts Petra and calls Mark his acolyte but Mark refuses to participate. A terrified Petra is let go from the car on the deserted forest road. Ian tells Mark that he didn't kill the missing teenager, that it was Gary who accidentally killed her and found Tanya buried in \\"his territory.\\" He takes Mark back to his house where it is revealed James is dead, wrapped up in plastic in the bath. Mark then finds Chasely chained to a wall in the basement. Ian holds a gun to her head and makes Mark confess that it was in fact he who brutalized Tanya, but he didn't intend to kill her. As she was running away from him, Gary had accidentally hit her with his car. Gary and Mark had apparently decided to keep it secret and bury her body. Ian's deaf wife Kay is revealed to be a willing accomplice with Ian and promptly stabs Mark in the stomach. She takes out her hearing aids and disappears back upstairs. Ian bends down to taunt Mark, but Mark stabs him with a blade he had taken from the garage, allowing Chasely to uncuff herself with Ian's keys. However once she gets to the front door she finds it is deadlocked and must return to the basement. She goes back down and is nearly strangled by Ian, but she pulls the knife out of his side and stabs him until he dies. Mark dies from his wounds. She then grabs the keys and makes her way out. The scene cuts to Ian's wife bottle-feeding their baby and ends with Chasely staggering up the night road into the path of a halting car.  Cast   Production  The film uses minimal music throughout the film and there are many scenes split by an Australian landscape or suburban sprawl. The film was shot on location at the Glasshouse Mountains and Redcliffe in Queensland.

Ferguson, 113 U.S. 727 (1885), was a suit regarding the legitimacy of a sale of a steam engine and other machinery in the State of Ohio.. Background The plaintiff, which was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio, with its principal place of business at Mount Vernon, Ohio, on February 22, 1880 at the County of Larimer, in the State of Colorado, entered into a contract in writing of that date with the defendants, who were citizens of Colorado, by which it was agreed that the plaintiff should sell to the defendants, and deliver to them on the cars at Mount Vernon, in the State of Ohio, a steam engine and other machinery, in consideration whereof the defendants were to pay the plaintiff the price stipulated in the contract for such machinery. A suit was brought by the plaintiff on August 10, 1880, to recover of the defendants damages for their breach of the contract. The defendants, among other defenses, first pleaded that when the contract was entered into, the plaintiff had not filed the certificate required by Colorado ¬ß 23 of the act of 1877; and second, that at the time of making the contract, the plaintiff did not have a known place of business in the State of Colorado, and did not have an authorized agent or agents in the state upon whom process might be served. The plaintiff demurred to both these answers because they did not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the action. Upon the hearing of the demurrer, the judges of the circuit court were divided in opinion, and the presiding judge being of opinion that the demurrer should be overruled, it was overruled accordingly, and the plaintiff electing to stand by its demurrer, judgment was entered against it dismissing its suit, and for costs. By the present writ of error, the plaintiff brings that judgment under review. Decision The certificate of division of opinion recites the facts above set forth, and states the question upon which the judges differed to be: Justice Woods delivered the opinion of the Court: Justice Matthews and Justice Blatchford concurred, on different grounds from those stated in the opinion: In the opinion of the court, there was error in the judgment of the circuit court, the judgment should be reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

The passengers were assured by the operator of the aircraft that visas were arranged and would be obtained upon arrival. Even without visas or security clearance, they were cleared to land by air traffic controllers, who were aware of their situation and assured them that a fine would be sufficient to clear the matter up. However, they were put in detention, then sentenced to jail. The Merauke Five consisted of middle-aged Queenslanders - pilot William Scott-Bloxam, his wife Vera and passengers Keith Mortimer, Hubert Hofer and Karen Burke. The trip's intended purpose was part sightseeing and part business. Their arrival date was 12 September 2008. Appeal After being sentenced to between two and three years' jail each, the group appealed the case in the Jayapura High Court, resulting in their freedom as the court overturned the jail sentence. When they arrived at the airport, however, they found their plane surrounded by Indonesian security, who had confiscated it on behalf of the prosecutors who lodged an appeal to overturn the High Court ruling. The plane, they said, was required for evidence. And as the court ruling stipulated they must leave in their own plane, the Merauke Five were trapped at Mopah airport ‚Äî too afraid to leave in case they would be charged again for other charges. Defence lawyer Mohammad Rifan told AAP (Australian Associated Press) that under Indonesian law, the prosecutors were not permitted to appeal against a High Court decision. \\"Under the law of the criminal code, 'article 244', if the court orders the release as soon as possible, right now, you cannot appeal to the Supreme Court,\\" he said. \\"If this happened for an Indonesian national, they would be free straight away. Why not for an Australian national?\\" But an Indonesian law expert in Australia said that while it is true the country does not allow appeal of absolute acquittals, they do allow it in other cases ‚Äì such as, for example, if someone is acquitted because they were found to be under duress. \\"The question is whether the Merauke Five's is an absolute acquittal for the purposes of Indonesian law\\", said Director of the Asian Law Centre at Melbourne University, Professor Tim Lindsey. \\"That will be a first issue that will be raised when the issue comes back before the courts.\\" Lindsey noted, however, that Indonesian courts have been \\"quite inconsistent in how they interpret article '244', and have tended to read it in a way that will allow the appeal to go ahead\\". He also said that in Australia, it is unusual for a prosecutor to appeal. Australian Government's response Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, indicated that at that point, he would not put pressure on the Indonesian Government to release the five. \\"We have to go through and respect the Indonesian legal processes, and currently they are subject to an appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court,\\" he said. \\"Their status now is what is described as 'city detention'. So they effectively have what is described as a licence to the city, but we are giving them consular assistance.\\" Karen Burke, one of the five, pleaded with the Australian Government to do more to help. \\"We're scared to death to leave,\\" she said. \\"We think if we put a foot out the front door we could be arrested on some other charges. Our position is quite precarious.\\" A Foreign Affairs spokesman in Australia said, \\"This situation is distressing for the Australians and their families, and the embassy in Jakarta is discussing with the five Australians and their lawyers the next steps towards obtaining their release and return. We understand that the five are no longer in detention, but are unable to depart for Australia. They are currently at the Immigration Office at Merauke Airport endeavouring to clarify their legal status. Our embassy consular official is also assisting them in consultation with the Indonesian authorities.\\" Difficulties in returning to Australia Their convictions were dismissed by Indonesia's Supreme Court on 10 June 2009 and they were ordered to return to Australia. But 12 days later, on 22 June 20, the group was still waiting for Indonesia's attorney-general's office to issue a final piece of paperwork. \\"As soon as it has been issued it will take only a short time for the immigration department to issue the final release order,\\" said the group's lawyer, Mohammad Rifan. But some people within the attorney- general's office still seemed \\"reluctant\\" to let the Australians leave, Rifan said.http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25671673-2702,00.html On Wednesday, Merauke District Court officials received from Jakarta the paperwork that enabled them to return the five Australians' passports and let the pilot, William Scott-Bloxam, fire up his twin-engined aircraft. However, the group's lawyer, Mohammad Rifan, said he feared prosecutors may yet raise further hurdles. \\"They still have not lifted the ban that prevents them leaving. They say they have to ask the attorney-general's office for guidance to do this,\\" said Rifan. \\"But it seems like there is an effort from prosecutors to hinder the process.\\" Rifan was right. As immigration officials strode towards the Australians' light plane to hand over their stamped passports, an aggrieved prosecutor, Yafeth Bonai, emerged on the tarmac and intervened. With local media present and the bemused Australians watching, Mr Bonai started shouting at the immigration officials, saying he had not seen the paperwork that cleared the Australians to leave. A heated argument lasting 20 minutes took place in front of the plane, with Mr Bonai not prepared to accept assurances by the Indonesian immigration department that a travel ban had been lifted after the country's highest court found the Australians innocent of immigration and aviation offences. \\"I need to see it in black and white,\\" Mr Bonai shouted. Told to phone his superiors and check, he responded, \\"We can't phone our bosses and order them around.\\" The officials agreed to leave and reconvene at Mr Bonai's office. After phone calls were made to Jakarta, Mr Bonai finally conceded the travel ban had been rescinded. Safe arrival home After their safe arrival home in late June 2009, the five, in front of news reporters, thanked all those who had a hand in their release, including the Australian Government. They avoided questions about the amount of help that had been provided by the Australian Government. When asked, Mr Mortimer replied with, \\"We have no complaints, they did a great job for us. I think they should have got themselves involved a lot earlier than they did but bottom line is they got there and we're out.\\" They also made sure that they did not dump too heavily on the Indonesian authorities although they had strong suspicions that the case was driven by political motivation. \\"I don't know what was driving the Attorney-General's office, but it was certainly more than the fact that people didn't have visas or that the paperwork was not correct,\\" Mr Scott-Bloxam said. \\"It's hard to imagine that you end up in the highest court in the land for a misdemeanour case,\\" Mr Mortimer said. Foreign Minister Stephen Smith was unavailable for an interview but the Department of Foreign Affairs issued an extensive statement welcoming the group home, but pointed out that before travelling, Australians needed to inform themselves about the laws of the countries they planned to visit. The statement also said that if people disobeyed foreign laws and ended up in court, the Government's ability to assist them would be very limited. The statement then stated that the Australian Government registered its strong interest in the case being handled expeditiously with the Indonesian Government. After the Australians touched down in Horn Island, one of the five went back to work. Another worked on restoring his home ‚Äì a boat on which he lived ‚Äì to full order, and another took a break, too emotionally exhausted to think about working. William Scott- Bloxam, the main player in the five's detention, and wife Vera set about resurrecting their aviation business.

She was referred to posthumously as Kumentje. The term Kumentje was used instead of her personal name as it is customary among many indigenous communities not to refer to the deceased by their original given name for some time after their death. She lived in the communities of Haasts Bluff, Papunya, and later at Kintore, about north-east of the Lake MacDonald region where she was born, on the border of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Makinti Napanangka began painting Contemporary Indigenous Australian art at Kintore in the mid-1990s, encouraged by a community art project. Interest in her work developed quickly, and she is now represented in most significant Australian public art galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia. A finalist in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award, Makinti won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2008. Her work was shown in the major indigenous art exhibition Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Working in synthetic polymer on linen or canvas, Makinti's paintings primarily take as their subjects a rockhole site, Lupul, and an indigenous story (or \\"dreaming\\") about two sisters, known as Kungka Kutjarra. She was a member of the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative, but her work has been described as more spontaneous than that of her fellow Papunya Tula artists. Personal life Haasts Bluff, where Makinti lived in the 1940s and 1950s Makinti Napanangka's year of birth is uncertain, but several sources indicate she was born around 1930, although other sources indicate she may have been born as early as 1922 or as late as 1932 at a location described by some sources as Lupul rockhole but by one major reference work as Mangarri. All sources agree that she comes from the area of Karrkurritinytja or Lake MacDonald, which straddles the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory, south-west of Kintore, and about west of Alice Springs. Makinti was a member of the Pintupi group of indigenous people, who are associated with the communities of Papunya, Kintore, and Kiwirrkura. \\"Napanangka\\" is a skin name, one of eight used to denote the subgroups in the Pintupi kinship system, not a surname in the sense used by Europeans. Thus her personal name was \\"Makinti\\". The uncertainty around Makinti's date and place of birth arises from the fact that Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth by comparison with other events, especially for people born before contact with European Australians. They may also cite the place of birth as being where the mother first felt the foetus move, rather than where the birth took place. Makinti's first contact with white people was seeing them riding camels, when she was living at Lupul. She was one of a large group of people who walked into Haasts Bluff in the early 1940s, together with her husband Nyukuti Tjupurrula (brother of artist Nosepeg Tjupurrula), and their son Ginger Tjakamarra, born around 1940. At Haasts Bluff they had a second child, Narrabri Narrapayi, in 1949. The population moved to Papunya in the late 1950s, where Makinti had another child, Jacqueline Daaru, in 1958. She had a daughter, Winnie Bernadette, in 1961 in Alice Springs. The family moved to Kintore when it was established in the early 1980s, and by 1996 Kumentje was painting there for the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative. Her children Ginger, Narrabri, and Jacqueline also became artists, all of them painting for Papunya Tula Artists. Physically tiny yet robust and strong, Kumentje was described as \\"a charmer and an irascible character\\", with an infectious smile. She died in Alice Springs in January 2011.  Artistic career  Artists of the Papunya Tula movement were painting at Haasts Bluff in the late 1970s, but the deaths of some of the main painters in the early 1980s led to a period of decline. In 1992, the Ikuntji Women's Centre was opened at Haasts Bluff and a new painting movement quickly developed, supported by founding art coordinator Marina Strocchi, who assisted in artists' development at both Haasts Bluff and Kintore. It was through this initiative that Kumentje began painting in 1994 for the Minyma Tjukurrpa (Kintore/Haasts Bluff Project)National Gallery of Victoria, artist biography and by 1997 her work was being acquired by major collecting institutions. She was one of the \\"Kintore ladies\\" who joined earlier generations of the famous Papunya Tula artists, and was referred to as \\"number one\\" by her fellow artists, of whom she was considered a leader. She painted with the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative, in which she was a shareholder, from 1996, alongside artist such as Ningura Napurrula. Rocks at Lupulnga (2000), painting by Makinti Napanangka Image: the artist, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd, Utopia Art Sydney and Aboriginal Artists Agency Ltd The only break in her career was in 1999, when she underwent a cataract operation, an event that journalist Nicolas Rothwell suggested was associated with a distinct shift in her work, including the increasing use of thick lines. Johnson said the operation resulted in \\"a collection of light-flooded canvases\\"; Art Gallery of New South Wales curator Hetti Perkins said that, after her recovery, \\"her work showed renewed vigour\\". Makinti's works were selected to hang in five consecutive National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) exhibitions, beginning in 1997. In 2000, she held her first solo exhibition, and was one of the artists whose works were included in the major exhibition Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The following year, she was a finalist at the NATSIAA. 2003 saw her named by Australian Art Collector magazine as one of the country's 50 most collectible artists, an assessment repeated by that magazine in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Also in 2003, she was among the finalists for the Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. By 2006, her works were commanding \\"the upper end of the price spectrum\\", though the resale values of those of her works not sold through Papunya Tula artists were considered precarious, owing to such works being of variable quality. In August 2008, Makinti won the $40,000 NATSIAA, but her age and circumstances prevented her from accepting it in person. In October 2008, she was one of several prominent artists whose works featured in a charity auction securing funds for the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. Her painting sold for A$18,500, a significant contribution to the quarter of a million dollars raised. In 2009, she was again a finalist in the NATSIAA, with an untitled painting and was also a finalist in the Togart Contemporary Art Award the same year.Togart Contemporary Art Award (NT) 2009, The Toga Group, Darwin, NT, p. 33 In 2011 she was a finalist in the 36th Alice Art Prize and in 2011 she was posthumously awarded the Member of the Order of Australia, for \\"service to the arts as a contemporary Indigenous artist, to women painters of the Western Desert Art movement, and to the community of the Northern Territory\\". Most of Australia's public collections hold one or more works by Makinti, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. She participated in some major group exhibitions, such as Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Colour Power at the National Gallery of Victoria, as well as having had a small number of solo exhibitions at private galleries, including the gallery of influential art dealer Gabrielle Pizzi. The National Portrait Gallery in Canberra has in its collection a photographic portrait of Kumentje, by Malaysian-born Australian artist Hari Ho. Her work was selected for inclusion in the 2012 Sydney Biennale.  Style of painting  Makinti's works, including her Clemenger Award and NATSIAA paintings, are created with synthetic polymer on linen or canvas. Many paintings by artists of the Western Desert relate to water, while the story (or \\"dreaming\\") most frequently portrayed by Western Desert women is Kungka Kutjarra, or Two Women, concerning the travel of two sisters. Makinti's works reflect those themes, and are particularly associated with a rockhole site, Lupul, and with Kungka Kutjarra. Her untitled painting in the Genesis and Genius exhibition was based on Kungka Kutjarra, while the painting that won the 2008 Telstra award related to Lupul. The iconography of her paintings includes the use of lines representing paths and ceremonial hair-string skirts, and circles representing water-holes. According to Art Gallery of New South Wales indigenous art curator and NATSIAA judge Hetti Perkins, Makinti and her work are \\"very dynamic and charismatic\\". Although a member of the Papunya Tula Artists, Makinti's work has been described as taking \\"a more spontaneous approach in illustrating the traditional iconography than that done by previous artists painting at Papunya\\". Her style evolved over time, beginning with gestural brush strokes in ordered compositions, and developing into more closely interwoven representations of the hair-string skirts and designs reflecting those used in body painting. Throughout this evolution, her colour palette has consistently included a subtle range of yellows and pinks, through to oranges and whites. Judith Ryan, senior curator at the National Gallery of Victoria, described Makinti's entry in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award as: > concerned with touching and sensing with fingers, rather than purely visual. > The repetition of colour chords and textured striations, which closely echo > each other, has a rhapsodic effect akin to many bodies in dance and reveals > the inner or spiritual power, the essence, of Makinti Napanangka's country > and cultural identity. The energetic lines invoke body paint for women‚Äôs > business, and more particularly represent spun hair-string, which is used to > make belts worn by women during ceremonies associated with the rockhole site > of Lupulnga, a Peewee Dreaming place. Reviewing the same exhibition, Robert Nelson described Makinti's work as \\"sensual and chromatically effusive painting\\". The work of the \\"Kintore ladies\\" has created \\"some of the most richly textured surfaces in the history of the (Papunya Tula) company\\"; Makinti's painting for Genesis and Genius was hailed as \\"a painterly celebration of colour and form\\".

The specific duties and areas of responsibility of state architects vary, but they generally involve responsibility for the design and/or construction of public buildings in the state. The state architect and subordinates typically form an organizational unit variously named the Division of the State Architect, Office of the State Architect, or similar.California State Architect Website  Functions  Specific functions vary from state to state, but may include: * Preparing designs and specifications for small and moderate-sized state-owned building or renovation projects * Selecting and overseeing the work of architectural firms contracted by the state to prepare designs and specifications for larger state-owned building projects * Reviewing and approving designs prepared by private-sector architects for \\"critical\\" buildings owned by political subdivisions of the state such as schools, police stations, fire stations, and/or hospitals * Participating in the development of state building codes and regulations * Developing and managing capital budgets for state building construction programs * Providing or coordinating inspection programs for state building projects The Division of the State Architect is typically separate from the licensing board that examines and licenses practicing architects in the state.  History  =United States= Isaac G. Perry is considered to have been the first state architect in New York. In 1883, governor Grover Cleveland appointed Perry to oversee construction activities at the state capitol. Although his official title was \\"Capitol Commissioner\\", by the mid- to late 1880s Perry had oversight responsibility for all state government building programs and he was commonly referred to as the \\"State Architect\\". The state legislature officially created the Office of the State Architect in 1899, and after Perry retired that same year, governor Theodore Roosevelt appointed George L. Heins to fill the position. Heins served until his death in 1907, and was succeeded by Franklin B. Ware. Ware held the position until 1912, when he was removed from office and replaced by Herman Hoefer. Lewis Pilcher was appointed to replace Hoefer in 1913, and held the position until 1923. New York created an official Department of Architecture in 1914, during Pilcher's service.Nancy L. Todd (2006), New York's historic armories: an illustrated history, SUNY Press, 2006. , . Pages 215-216. In California, the Office of the State Architect (now Division of the State Architect) was created by the Field Act, which authorized the new office to develop design standards and quality control procedures for architectural work. George Sellon was the first State Architect for California. . Chester (Chet) A. Widom was the last state architect but retired in early 2019, and the current acting state architect is Ida Clair. =Australia= Currently there is a government architect in each Australian state, with the exception of Tasmania. Although their role differs from state to state, it generally includes the general objective to improve the design of public buildings and spaces and to enhance the quality of the built environment.\\"Government Architects' Network Australia, retrieved 30 March 2014 Since 1832 in New South Wales there was a position of Colonial Architect responsible for public works. In 1890 it was renamed to Government Architect. The Queensland Colonial Architect position was established in 1859. A government architect position named Principal Architect was created in Western Australia in 1891. The Northern Territory Government Architect role was first established in 2004, while in Victoria the role was first established in 2005.\\"Profile: Geoffrey London\\", in The Sydney Morning Herald, 3 December 2008  Requirements  Requirements vary from state to state, but usually state architects are required to be licensed to practice the profession of architecture in the state in question and to be a legal resident of that state. Because the job often involves managing large staffs, projects, and budgets, state architects are usually senior members of the architectural profession.

As part of the Khoshut Khanate of Tsaidam and the Koke Nuur they played a major role in Sino‚ÄìMongol‚ÄìTibetan politics during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Upper Mongols adopted Tibetan dress and jewelry despite still living in the traditional Mongolian ger and writing in the script. History After the disintegration of the Mongolic Xianbei state, nomadic groups such as the (Monguor) migrated under the rule of their Khan, Tuyuhun, from their original settlements on the Liaodong Peninsula to the eastern region of modern Qinghai.The T'u-y√º-hun from the Northern Wei to the time of the Five Dynasties, p. XII. 1970. Gabriella Mol√®. Rome. Is.M.E.O. The Tuyuhun Empire (284‚Äì670) stretched 1,500 kilometers from east to west and 1,000 kilometers from north to south. Although, the Mongols of the Gansu‚ÄìQinghai Lake areas under the rule of the Yuan dynasty submitted to the Ming dynasty after the Yuan dynasty's fall in 1368, the Upper Mongols came there in 16th and 17th centuries. Many Mongol emperors and rulers of the Northern Yuan dynasty such as Dayan Khan, Ligdan Khan, the Ordos and T√ºmed princes invaded, or took refuge, in Qinghai from 1509 to 1632. The T√ºmed Mongols ruled in the Ordos region and they gradually extended their domain into northeastern Qinghai.W.D.Shakabpa, Tibet: A Political History The Khoshut's leader Toro Baikhu G√ºshi Khan defeated all the Dalai Lama V's enemies in 1637‚Äì1642. He was enthroned by the Dalai Lama as Khan of Tibet. His grandson and second successor Gonchug Dalai Khan (1669‚Äì98) welcomed dissident Dzungars when Galdan Khan began despising Guushi Khan's Oirats. Statue of G√ºshi Khan (right) in the Dalai Lama's palace, next to the statue of the Dalai Lama himself (left). (Drawing by Johann Grueber, 1661) With the defeat of Galdan in 1697, Dalai Khung Taiji Dashi Batur submitted to the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in a personal audience. In 1705, with the approval of the Kangxi Emperor of the Manchu Qing dynasty, Lha-bzang Khan of the Khoshud deposed the regent and sent the 6th Dalai Lama to Beijing; the 6th Dalai Lama died soon after, probably near Qinghai Lake (Koko nur) in Amdo. The Dzungar Mongols invaded Tibet in 1717, and held the entire region until their final defeat by the Qing imperial army in 1720.,Richardson 1986, pp. 48‚Äì49 thus began the period of Qing rule of Tibet.

The Upper Mongols revolted against the Manchu Qing dynasty under rule of the prince Lubsan Danzan in 1723 but they were defeated. Lubsan Danzan was killed by the Manchus in 1755. The Upper Mongols in Northwest China revived their cultural ties with Inner Mongolia with the liberalization in 1979. The Tibetan culture strongly influenced them, however they use Mongolian script unlike other major Oirat tribes that use Zaja Pandita's Todo Bichig Clear script. The Khoshut Khanate (1642‚Äì1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau. The separation of the Tibetans from the Mongolian banners weakened the Upper Mongols. After 1775, the Tibetans made increasingly bold attacks on the Mongols. Hence, small group of the Upper Mongols fled to Gansu to escape the Tibetan nomads and they formed Subei Mongol county. In 1821 the Tibetan nomads made a mass migration north, sweeping away the Qinghai Mongol banners between the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake due to the internal strife between the Tibetans. In 1897 the Hui Muslims plundered the Upper Mongols. Ethnic groups of the Upper Mongols Not all Upper Mongols are Khoshut Oirats; there are a few Khalkha, Choros and Torghuts. The Ligdan Khan came to Upper Mongolia with 150,000‚Äì200,000 Chahar people (30,000‚Äì40,000 soldiers) and his ally Tsogt Taij came with 40,000 Khalkha soldiers, but 70%‚Äì90% of them were killed by disease and by the G√ºshi Khan's army.

Many Caribbean Brazilians are of Barbadian descent.Barbadians in the Brazilian Amazon Migration history During the rubber boom in the Brazilian Amazon, between 1880 and 1912, the construction of a railroad linking the Madeira River in Brazil to the Mamore River in Bolivia was undertaken to solve the problem of rubber transportation in that region. The railway would help to get the Bolivian rubber out of the jungle, past the rapids on the Madeira and then reach the navigable part of the river in Porto Velho, in the state of Rond√¥nia. For the construction of the Madeira-Mamor√© railroad, many African- Caribbean workers, especially from Barbados, were taken to that part of the Brazilian Amazon. The enterprise was first a British project but later was controlled by the American Percival Farquhar who had a Brazilian business empire. This adventure in the Amazon brought about the death of about six thousand workers, caused by attacks from Indigenous Amerindian tribes, malaria and many other diseases. The term Barbadian, in fact, was used as a globalizing identification attributed to the foreign Blacks who went to the Amazon from several parts of the Caribbean, mainly Barbados, but also from Saint Lucia, Jamaica, Martinique, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. They migrated, or rather were taken, to the Brazilian state of Rond√¥nia which was a wilderness in the beginning of the twentieth century. It was a migration motivated by work, by the search for a new life, causing the rupture of family roots and culture as well as producing a feeling of displacement and lack of emotional ties. Their job was to cut the railway through the mainly terrain of Rio Abuna. Under the order of the English engineer, Collier, the Caribbeans worked hard for the American enterprise.

He travelled with Hitler in the years leading up to and throughout World War II and took around 2,000 colour photographs of the German dictator and various events connected with criminal policy of Nazi Germany during the Second World War for example the invasion of Poland, Polish soldiers resting after the battle against Germans, destruction of Warsaw and persecution of Jews by the German Nazis in Kutno during the Holocaust and infamous Warsaw Ghetto where people were just prisoners in the heart of the modern city during the Holocaust. Jaeger was one of the few photographers who were using color photography techniques at the time. Early life Hugo Jaeger was born on 18 January 1900. Career Jaeger began photographing Hitler in 1936 and was doing so until the Second World War ended in 1945. Jaeger also specialised in taking color photographs of the Nazi propaganda spectacles, unlike Hitler's other personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. As the war was drawing to a close in 1945, Jaeger hid the photographs in a leather suitcase. He then encountered American soldiers prompting fears of potential arrest and prosecution for carrying around so many images of such a wanted man. When the soldiers opened the case however, their attention was distracted by a bottle of cognac they found there, which they opened and shared with Jaeger. Jaeger buried the photographs inside 12 glass jars outside Munich. The photographer returned to the burial place over several years to ensure they were safe. He dug up all of the photographs ten years later in 1955, and stored them in a bank vault. In 1965, Jaeger sold them to Life magazine. Death and legacy Jaeger died on 1 January 1970. Life.com published the photographs as the 65th anniversary of D-Day beckoned in June 2009. The website published the photographs in four separate galleries online. One photo showed Hitler saluting German troops in Adolf Hitler Platz on 1 September 1938. Another showed the Nazi leader attending a Christmas Party in 1941.

Her father was German Socialist and internationalist who fled to Switzerland as a result of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1918 she joined the newly formed Communist Party of Switzerland after seeing the outcome of the October Revolution. Clara moved to France and worked for the French Communist newspaper L'Humanit√© in the 1920s, but broke with the newspaper following Stalin's rise to power in 1928. She returned to Basel where she met her future husband Paul Thalmann, who also had been born in Basel and had spent the past four years studying in Moscow, where he grew disillusioned and returned to Switzerland to work with dissident groups. As a result of their criticism of Stalin's policies, both were thrown out of the Party in 1929 and became involved with the Communist Party Opposition. In 1932 Clara Thalmann became editor of Arbeiter-Zeitung in Schaffhausen, working closely with Trotskyists and Left-Communists.  Spain  In Spain the newly elected Popular Front organized the People's Olympiad in Barcelona as a response to the 1936 Summer Olympics being hosted in Nazi Germany. She travelled south to attend as a representative of Arbeiterschwimmclubs (Worker's Swim Club)Alba, V√≠ctor & Stephen Schwartz, Spanish Marxism vs Soviet Communism: A History of the P.O.U.M, Transaction Publishers, 1988, p.124 but due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War the games never occurred. Impressed by the strength and size of the working class anarchist movement in Catalonia and the successes of the Spanish Revolution, Clara joined the Durruti Column; a column of anarchists organized to fight against the Fascists. The militia marched from Barcelona to support the Republicans on the Aragon front, where Clara was joined by Paul Thalmann. Conflict was developing within the Republican forces: the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) attacked the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Under pressure from the Soviet Union, the PCE integrated the anarchist militias into the Republican army. Tensions finally erupted following provocation from the PCE in an attempted takeover of the Barcelona Telephone Exchange and fighting broke out between the PCE and the Anarchists (CNT, FAI) resulting in the Barcelona May Days and resulting the members of the POUM and the UGT along with the Anarchists being defeated. In the end over 500 lay dead. Clara Thalmann and Paul fought with a group called \\"Amigos de Durruti\\" (Friends of Durruti). At the barricades, Clara came to know George Orwell. During the repression that followed the events of May 1937, Paul and Clara Thalmann went underground. They were arrested a few months later when attempting to flee Spain by boat from Barcelona and were incarcerated by the Servicio de Informaci√≥n Militar (SIM), the Republican security forces. After several months in prison, they were released through the efforts of friends in Switzerland. After their release in 1937 they moved to Paris.SolFed. \\"Clara Thalmann\\", Catalyst, #1 Winter 1987.  France  During World War II, Clara and Paul were active in the French Resistance and creation of the small revolutionary resistance group; Groupe R√©volutionnaire Prol√©tarien. They secretly housed Jews or German-born revolutionaries and managed to not get caught. After the war, the two grew tired of living in Paris and in 1953 they settled near Nice and created a commune called \\"La S√©r√©na\\". La S√©r√©na became a haven for libertarian militants from various countries. They stayed in touch with new generations of student activists during the years 1960s-70s. In 1974 Paul and Clara published their memoirs entitled Revolution f√ºr die Freiheit.http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/t/10771255full.php Three years after Paul's death in 1981, Clara returned to Spain for the first time since 1937 to revisit the sites of the Spanish Civil War with comrade Augustin Souchy, publishing their experience in the documentary The Long Hope (Die lange Hoffnung). Clara died on January 27, 1987 in her home in Nice from lung cancer.

Early Life, Slave Laborer at Sub- Camps of Auschwitz  Willner, his mother and his father, a veteran of the German Army from World War I and recipient of the Iron Cross, fled Germany in 1939 due to the worsening situation for the Jews. They went initially to Belgium and then to France. Following the German occupation of France they were arrested and transported from Drancy internment camp near Paris to Auschwitz. Willner's mother was immediately sent to the gas chambers, the SS made the male Willners slave laborers at subcamps of Auschwitz. At one of those camps, Blechhammer, Willner‚Äôs father became ill and was sent to Auschwitz and murdered. The SS put the prisoners including Willner on a death march to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where he was then transported by train to Buchenwald and then on to one of Buchenwald's sub-camps, Langenstein- Zwieberge.  Slave Laborer at Langenstein-Zwieberge, Sub-Camp of Buchenwald  The work at Langenstein was excavation of rock in order to build tunnels to hide (from allied reconnaissance) production facilities for the Junkers factories that would build new types of aircraft and weapons. The work was extraordinarily harsh even by Nazi concentration camp standards. On average prisoners survived six weeks.  Death March, Escape  Towards the end of the war, the SS put Willner and the other prisoners on another death march. At one point Willner and five others prisoners attempted to escape; Willner and one other prisoner, his close friend Maurits Swaab, were successful despite gunfire from the guards, the fate of the others is unknown. By following the sounds of artillery, Willner and Swaab found the U.S. Army 3rd Armored Division, 32nd Regiment, Company D. As the company advanced further eastward, the two survivors pointed out German positions which they had observed during their escape. The unit's medical personnel examined Willner and indicated he weighed 75 pounds. The soldiers of the division cared for the two survivors over several months and returned them to health. After the war Willner learned that 27 members of his family had been murdered by the Nazis.  Life after the War  After the war, Willner immigrated to the United States and dedicated his life to service to the country that liberated him. He enlisted in the US Army and served for 21 years. Willner served in Europe, Korea and Japan, primarily as a criminal investigator and intelligence officer. He retired in 1969 as a Major. Willner continued to serve his country as a US federal government employee for another 20 years and as a volunteer for 20 years on the Falls Church, VA Law Enforcement Safety and Advisory Commission. Eddie Willner married a German, Johanna, who had fled the Russian occupation of Germany. Johanna is the author of Christine: A Life in Germany after World War II, a novel based on the three years before her escape from East Germany. Nina Willner, Eddie and Johanna's daughter, wrote Forty Autumns: A Family's Story of Courage and Survival on Both Sides of the Berlin Wall, a narrative non-fiction book which further details the family's journey through the Cold War. Eddie and Johanna were married for 49 years until his death in 2008. They had six children. Gravesite Eddie Willner's gravesite at Arlington National Cemetery.

He publishes the Prayer & Action News quarterly newsletter (1989‚Äìpresent), and edits the website The Partnership Machine (1998‚Äìpresent) which covers social issues including abortion, politics, religion, immigration, divorce, sodomy, and education. Biography Leach runs a Des Moines, Iowa music store, the Family Music Center. Leach and his wife Dorothy have music degrees and have taught since 1974 on several instruments. He has run for the Iowa General Assembly six times and lost, in his first attempt (1986) as a Democrat and in the rest (1988, 1990, 2000, 2002, 2010) as a Republican. He was a candidate for the Iowa legislature again in 2012 but lost in the Republican primary election. Since 1995 Leach has operated a public- access television show on cable called \\"The Uncle Ed Show\\" and he also worked as a journalist for the central Iowa newspaper Ankeny Today.. In 2011, Leach authored and self-published the book entitled Eternal Hell: Heaven's Loving Purpose (). Activism Leach's publications argue in favor of the doctrine of justifiable homicide in the case of abortion doctors. Leach wrote in a 2002 newsletter that violent acts against abortion clinic property in the defense of unborn children is justifiable, since the person reasonably believes the violence is absolutely necessary in order to prevent serious harm or death to innocents, and the violence should not considered a criminal offense if it can be proven that the person acted in the defense of others. He has also written a number of legal arguments including appellate and pro se trial briefs in support of what he calls the \\"Necessity Defense\\", in which necessity may be either a possible justification or an exculpation for breaking the law. Prayer & Action News also featured occasional contributions from Scott Roeder, the convicted killer in the assassination of George Tiller, a doctor in Wichita, Kansas who performed late term abortions. Leach, who described Roeder as \\"anti-government,\\" said he stopped to see Roeder in Kansas prior to 2009, after visiting Shelley Shannon in prison. (Shannon was convicted in 1993 of shooting Tiller in both arms outside his clinic.) Leach also conducted a telephone interview with Roeder in April, 2013. During this interview, Roeder issued further threats of violence, for which he was held in solitary confinement for 45 days. In an interview with the Iowa Independent, Leach said that to call ‚Äú...killing a killer a crime is too simplistic. Leach said when human law conflicts with God‚Äôs Laws, \\"we ought to obey God rather than man\\", and that he will not \\"advocate\\" that anyone go out and kill someone who performs abortions, but his \\"mind remains open on the question.\\" Leach was fired in 1996 from his reporter job at Ankeny Today, after he reprinted 40 pages of the Army of God Manual in the January 1996 issue of his Prayer & Action News, which gave step-by-step instructions for making plastic explosives and fertilizer bombs. The publication also discussed strategies for disabling or destroying abortion clinics. At the time, he said he published the material because he feared it was about to be suppressed by a court. In 1994, United States Marshals were sent to guard the Des Moines office of Planned Parenthood. Officials said the step was taken partly because of concerns about Leach, after he had signed statements saying that Paul Jennings Hill and Michael F. Griffin could have been justified in killing abortion- providing doctors in Florida. The manual begins with a \\"declaration of war\\" on abortion clinics and states, \\"The Editors of this manual hope and pray that the information contained herein will be useful to those who are committed to pro-life activism, and may perhaps provide the catalyst to inspire others to such a commitment.\\" Under the heading \\"99 Covert Ways to Stop Abortion\\" the document details clandestine tactics activists can use to shut down abortion clinics. The \\"Revised and Expanded\\" third edition Epilogue contains a Declaration which concludes with a paragraph that supports murdering abortion providers, calling such murders justifiable homicide. The manual had previously been published only anonymously, and mailed anonymously to pro-life leaders and news reporters. Leach's reprint of it was the first printing that was not anonymous. The introduction explained that Janet Reno's Virginia Grand Jury had, for a year, subpoenaed pro-lifers and \\"commanded\\" them to bring any copies they had of the Army of God Manual, which were then taken, which Leach alleged was treating the possession of the book as a crime. Leach wrote of the reprinting: \\"If owning a book is a crime, here I am; prosecute me.\\" Within days after reprints went in the mail, the Virginia Grand Jury was disbanded. In 1998 the fictional series Rescue Platoon, a story of a future, final war against abortion, was serialized on Leach's website. The story ends with the Army of God, following a violent battle, gaining the final victory. The story includes a depiction of the Army of God bombing a Florida abortion clinic. In 2002 Mediacom, owner of the cable television station hosting Leach's program The Uncle Ed. Show. said that Leach would not be allowed to broadcast film of women entering a Planned Parenthood clinic here unless their faces were covered. In April 2013, Leach posted a video to YouTube which included a recorded telephone conversation with Roeder, discussing the fact that Tiller's abortion clinic had been re-opened by another agency. Leach said: During this telephone interview, Roeder issued further threats of anti-abortion violence, for which he was placed in solitary confinement for 45 days. His privileges were also reduced for an additional 60 days.  Media appearances Leach appeared in the HBO documentary film Soldiers in the Army of God, and was a guest on The Alan Colmes Show discussing his views on abortion. He is listed in Marquis Who's Who publications, including Who's Who in America.

It describes Coleridge's feelings of leaving school for Cambridge in an optimistic manner quite contrary to the views he expressed later in life. Background Coleridge attended Christ's Hospital for his pre-college education and completed many poetic exercises during his time there. During his final year, he wrote \\"On Quitting School for College\\" for an exercise and included his feelings about his school years, his future at college, and his childhood home at Ottery.Ashton 1997 p. 30 It was completed during the summer of 1791 see 1791 in poetry)and included in the Ottery Copy Book, a manuscript containing poetry from Coleridge's early years. The poem was eventually published in the 1834 edition of Coleridge's poems (see 1834 in poetry).Mays 2001 p. 54 Another poem titled \\"Absence: A Farewell Ode on Quitting School for Jesus College, Cambridge\\", and Coleridge stated that he wrote it during 1791. It was published in the Sherborne Weekly Enterainer during the summer of 1793Mays 2001 p. 61 and it is published again in the October 1794 Cambridge Intelligencer. The tone of the later edition is serious, where a possible 1792 version in a letter could be a parody.Watson 1966 p. 48 Poem \\"On Quitting School\\" is a sonnet dedicated to saying goodbye to Christ's Hospital and Ottery: There is a tone of regret within the poem:Kneale 1999 p. 89 =Absence= Like \\"On Quitting School\\", \\"Absence\\" deals with saying farewell to a time, although it is uncertain what specific event or subject he was remembering. The subtitle \\"A Farewell Ode on Quitting School for Jesus College, Cambridge\\" is a variation of the poem alters the meaning of the poem.Mays 2001 pp. 60‚Äì61 The poem begins with a respectful description of the narrator's education: Like \\"On Quitting School\\", there is also a tone of regret: It is possible that the 1792 poem, \\"A Fragment Found in a Lecture Room\\", is a parody and makes fun of his education (called Mathesis) as the first four lines of this poem read: Themes The terms that Coleridge uses to describe his time at Ottery and at school are more positive than his real feelings. Years later, he would recall bad experiences from his school days and include negative descriptions of the time in poems such as \\"Frost at Midnight\\". The final years at Christ's Hospital were filled with pain and suffering, as Coleridge lost both a brother and a sister at the time, and these emotions come out in the poetry during that time. Richard Holmes, Coleridge's late 20th-century biographer, wrote, \\"Perhaps this also explains the intense emotion with which he finally left Christ's Hospital that summer, celebrated in his 'Sonnet:On Quitting School for College' [...] He bid 'Adieu, adieu! to the 'much-lov'd cloisters pale!', and spoke in tears of his happy days there\\".Holmes 1989 p. 38 Similarly, the later poem on saying goodbye to Christ's Hospital, \\"Absence\\", is a serious, but it is possible that an early version of the poem was a parody.Watson 1966 pp. 48‚Äì49 The tone and language of the poem is influenced by William Bowles's poetry; it differs from 18th- century poetic conventions and connects the style of the poem to many of Coleridge's other poems of the time, including \\"To the Autumnal Moon\\", \\"Pain\\", \\"On Receiving an Account that his only Sister's Death was Inevitable\\" and \\"To the River Otter\\".Holmes 1989 p. 35 Also, Coleridge uses the word \\"ah\\" in a regretful manner which is common to many of his poems, including \\"On Receiving an Account\\", \\"Absence\\" and \\"To the River Otter\\".

Supp. 2d 14 (D.D.C. 2008); Judge Facciola dismissed a defendant's objection to the adequacy of keywords used by the prosecution and ruled that a party challenging the efficacy of an opposing party's search terms must do so through expert testimony. He noted the complexity of search in the identification and production of electronically stored information and concluded that \\"[w]hether search terms or 'keywords' will yield the information sought is a complicated question involving the interplay, at least, of the sciences of computer technology, statistics and linguistics. ... Given this complexity, for lawyers and judges to dare opine that a certain search term or terms would be more likely to produce information than the terms that were used is truly to go where angels fear to tread.\\" * In Equity Analytics v. Lundin, the plaintiff claimed that a former employee gained illegal access to electronically stored information after he was fired and requested production of material on his personal computer.

The bridge today is a four-lane divided highway bridge, built in 1976, that carries Grays Ferry Avenue from the Grays Ferry neighborhood on the east bank, over the river and the Northeast Corridor railroad tracks, to the Southwest Philadelphia neighborhood of Kingsessing. In 1902, rail traffic was taken over by the adjacent Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Bridge No. 1, which in 2019 and 2020 is being rebuilt for use by cyclists and pedestrians traveling the Schuylkill River Trail. Ferry Before bridges crossed the Schuylkill, three ferries provided the main connections between Philadelphia and points west and south. Two of them crossed the river in or near the city limits: *Upper, or Sculls, Ferry, near the present-day Spring Garden Street Bridge. *Middle Ferry, near today's Market Street Bridge. The third, dubbed Lower Ferry, crossed south of the city proper and just south of the mouth of Mill Creek. It was likely established in 1673 or shortly thereafter by Benjamin Chambers, who was licensed to operate the ferry after Swedish settlers complained that they were blocked from passage on the Middle Ferry.The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Volume 46 In 1696, the government directed that two roads be laid out from either end of the Lower Ferry, also called Chambers' Ferry: one from the east landing north to Philadelphia, and the other westward toward Darby, Pennsylvania. The ferry thereby came to connect Philadelphia to the Darby Road (now Woodland Avenue at 47th Street), which was part of the King's Highway, the main land route to Delaware, Baltimore, and the southern colonies. It remained virtually the only conduit to the city from points south until 1781, when the construction of a federal road connected the ferry environs to Market Street in what would become West Philadelphia.The Building of West Philadelphia / 18th Century Landscape & Settlement Patterns It was still marked as \\"Lower Ferry\\" on a 1753 map, but it would soon take the name of its new proprietors, the brothers Robert and George Gray. George (1725‚Äì1800) owned large tracts of land near the ferry's eastern landing (in today's Grays Ferry neighborhood of South Philadelphia) and in 1787 became a signatory to Pennsylvania's ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Floating bridges From 1777 and through at least 1839, a series of floating bridges offered passage at Gray's, or Lower, Ferry. 1816 painting by Joshua Rowley Watson 1856 drawing of the floating bridges that were replaced in 1838. The first bridge across the Schuylkill River was a pontoon bridge built in 1777 by British troops occupying the city. Its construction was anticipated on the American side by General John Armstrong, Sr. of the Pennsylvania militia, who wrote on October 8, \\"I think they will also throw a bridge of some sort over Grey's Ferry, not only to maintain a communication with but secure a retreat to their shipping.\\" Armstrong was right. The bridge's preparation and construction were described by Captain John Montresor, the engineer on the staff of General William Howe: > *October 17, 1777 ‚Äî This day principally employed in my department in > transporting the materials for the Bridge of Schuylkill at Gray's Ferry > together with its boats. *18th ‚Äî The utmost preparation making to forward > the Bridge at Gray's Ferry across Schuylkill. *20th ‚Äî At half past 10 this > morning the engineers finished the floating Bridge across Schuylkill of 400 > feet. But this bridge remained in place only two days, as British commanders decided that the extra fording capacity was better used farther north. Montresor wrote, \\"22nd ‚Äî At 3 o' clock p.m., the works for the tete du pont at Gray's Ferry ordered to be stopt and the Detacht. to return and the bridge to be taken up and carried to Middle Ferry.\\" (He and his men completed this bridge on October 24, only to see it wash away four days later by \\"the N.E. Stormy High tide and rapid stream and Ebb tide together.\\" A replacement floating-log bridge at Middle Ferry was passable by November 10 and completed on November 11.) Back at Lower Ferry, a new floating bridge was once again in place by December 10, according to diary entries by British Army officer John Andr√©, who would go on to be the Army's chief of intelligence. On December 22, a large British force moved westward across the bridge and camped three miles from Darby. On December 28, the bridge was pulled up, perhaps to protect it from winter ice, as the Army moved north to cross back into the city at the Middle Ferry bridge. The British rebuilt the bridge at Gray's Ferry in the spring of 1778, and left it intact when they withdrew from the city that June. On August 7, 1778, the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wrote to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, saying, \\"In the course of the war it has been found useful to lay a bridge across the Schuylkill at this city. Another bridge over that river was erected by General Washington at Providence [near Valley Forge] in this county. And a third built by the enemy [the Gray's Ferry bridge] remains entire. It is worthy of consideration how these truly convenient structures may be rendered lastingly useful. The terms on which they may be passed ought to be settled.\\" Later that year, the deal was set: the U.S. government would pay 800 pounds annually for the maintenance of the bridge. Ice smashed the bridge to pieces in 1780, leading the Council to pay Major Benjamin Eyre 7,500 pounds to rebuild it. The rebuilt bridge featured a deck over planks attached to the logs, with anchors in mid-stream to steady it and railings for safety. Flexible, it rose and fell with the tide. Heavy wagons often depressed the deck a few inches below the water. A 1796 traveler wrote, \\"Although this bridge floated when not charged, or charged but lightly, the weight of our waggon depressed it several inches below the surface, the horses splashing through the water so that a foot passenger passing at the same time would have been exposed to serious inconvenience.\\" The bridge had a draw that could be lifted with ropes to allow boats to pass by. The whole span could be unmoored and allowed to float downstream in times of ice or heavy weather, then restored to service. The advantages of a permanent bridge were clear, but none would be built for several decades. In 1806, a \\"Gray's Ferry Bridge Company\\" was chartered, but it bore no fruit. In 1828, Martin Kochersperger noted that 304 vessels passed through the bridge in the month of March: 37 schooners, 106 sloops and shallops, 28 oyster boats, 98 curial boats, 16 fishing boats, seven pleasure boats, and 12 rafts. In 1834, a Philadelphia guidebook offered this description, \\"Gray's Ferry -- renowned as the junketing place of our forefathers where our grandfathers and grandmothers danced and sung where the scenery has a right pleasant smack of the antique about it and where the floating bridge still swings as it did in the days of the revolution.\\" =Notable crossings= The pontoon bridge at Gray's Ferry was decorated for the arrival of President-elect George Washington in Philadelphia on April 20, 1789. A rope line indicates the continuing use of a ferryboat alongside the bridge. During the 1787 Constitutional Convention, many delegates eager to escape the hot and humid city crossed the bridge on day trips to visit Gray's Ferry Tavern or Bartram's Garden a bit farther south. George Washington, who is likely to have used the ferry or its successor bridges whenever he traveled from his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia, to Philadelphia and points north, is known to have crossed the floating bridge at Gray's Ferry on at least two occasions. On May 13, 1787, Washington wrote about his arrival in Philadelphia for the convention to revise the Articles of Confederation: \\"At Grays Ferry the City light horse commanded by Colo. Miles met me, and escorted me in by the Artillery Officers who stood arranged & saluted me as I passed.\\" On April 20, 1789, when Washington traveled to New York City, then the national capital, to become the first president of the United States, the bridge was decorated for the latter occasion by the Grays, who enlisted the aid of Philadelphia artist Charles Willson Peale, with laurel arches and the flags of the states and the new country. Permanent bridges =Newkirk Viaduct (1838-1902)= An 1856 drawing of the 1838 railroad-and-highway Newkirk ViaductIn 1831, the Pennsylvania legislature chartered a new company to build a rail line from Philadelphia to the Delaware state line. A survey of routes was begun in July 1835, and the following year, company officials settled a debate over just how and where to cross the Schuylkill: a permanent bridge at Gray's Ferry. The firm, by now renamed The Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, bought the necessary land on December 31, 1836. Over the next two years, the railroad built an 800-foot covered truss bridge supported by five piers; its fifth span, as counted from the east, could be pulled into its sixth span to allow boats to pass. A single track ran along the bridge's southern side, separated by a fence from a roadway that ran along its northern side. The cost, including construction and land acquisition, came to nearly $200,000. The railroad named the bridge for its president, Matthew Newkirk (1794‚Äì1868), a Philadelphia business and civic leader, and erected an obelisk, the Newkirk Viaduct Monument, along its western approach. Construction on the rest of the 17 miles of track proceeded, and when the bridge opened in 1838, it was the final link in the first direct rail service between Philadelphia and Wilmington. It did not initially allow locomotives to pass, nor were locomotives particularly welcomed on city streets, so the cars were pulled by horses over the river and northward along three miles of track to the terminus of the PW&B.; That was the Southern and Western Railroad Station, a grand six-track station and PW&B; office building erected in 1840 at Broad Street and Washington Avenue (the former Prime Avenue). The new bridge was less than a year old when it was severely damaged. On January 26, 1839, historian Daniel Bowen wrote that a \\"great ice freshet ... swept away one of the piers and two of its sections. The floating bridge at Gray's Ferry was also carried away by the violence of the same flood. We are happy to learn that all the damages occurring from that rapid rise of the Schuylkill are in rapid progress of repair and that both the bridges are now passable.\\" (It is not clear when the floating bridge finally ceased to exist.) The damage was repaired within weeks for less than $15,000. A toll was charged for road traffic until 1847, when Philadelphia County paid the PW&B; $50,000 to eliminate the tolls. The deal also bound the railroad to rebuild the bridge if necessary. In June 1846, the Viaduct was chosen as the route for the telegraph line that completing the first telecommunications link from New York to Washington; operators complained of interruptions whenever the draw was opened. In 1852, the bridge was strengthened to handle more weight, and steam power at last replaced horses. This map inaccurately shows the PW&B; crossing the Schuylkill on the PRR's Arsenal Bridge. On November 11, 1854, a passing steamboat damaged the bridge. A temporary platform was quickly erected to carry traffic, and a large work crew set about making repairs. During the Civil War, the PW&B;'s Philadelphia terminal became the great embarkation and debarkation point for Philadelphia men going to and returning from war in the southern states. On December 23, 1863, a fire ‚Äî perhaps started by a locomotive's sparks ‚Äî damaged an eastern span of the bridge, and firefighters intentionally destroyed the draw section to protect the western part. The bridge was rebuilt as a Town lattice truss that was left uncovered. In 1865, the bridge was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court case Gilman v. Philadelphia, which upheld the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, including navigable streams in a particular state. 1876 photo looks northwest at the Newkirk Viaduct. 1899 photo looks southwest at the western end of the Newkirk Viaduct with the draw span retracted.By 1889, the Newkirk Viaduct was a four- span, 503-foot bridge, including a 92-foot Howe truss span with a 144-foot cover. The several acres around the Viaduct's western end had become a hub of railroad activity. The area had had an enginehouse since the Viaduct opened; by 1876, a bigger, eight-stall roundhouse had been erected. By 1877, passenger trains stopped at the Gray's Ferry station, on 49th Street between Grays and Paschall Streets. Here, northbound express trains from Washington, Baltimore, or Wilmington and heading farther north would be switched from PW&B; tracks to the Junction Railroad and on to the PRR's Philadelphia depot, allowing their passengers to continue their journey without switching trains. In 1873, the route south of the bridge was shifted somewhat away from the riverbank as far as Chester, a shift that drew the tracks away from marshy ground and eliminated several drawbridges from the route. The first train ran over this Darby Improvement route on May 12.After the Improvement opened, the PW&B;'s stations, from the northern terminal at Broad and Washington, were: Arsenal, Gray's Ferry, 58th Street, Mount Moriah, Bonnafon, Paschal, Darby, Sharon Hill, Glenolden, Norwood, etc. The Viaduct's importance as a rail bridge waned after 1880-81, when the Pennsylvania Railroad took control of the PW&B.; The PRR, whose passenger trains ran through West Philadelphia, used the Viaduct only to run freight to the Delaware River docks via Washington Street, while the Baltimore & Ohio, which had previously run trains over the bridge, was forced to build its own bridge one-third of a mile to the south. A new draw span was constructed in 1891, but maintenance remained difficult for the rest of the decade. Moreover, the city of Philadelphia itched for a broader bridge to carry trolley and other street traffic between the rapidly developing neighborhoods of Grays Ferry and Kingsessing. =Grays Ferry Bridge (1901-76) = The 1901 Grays Ferry Bridge replaced the non-railroad functions of the Newkirk Viaduct. It carried automotive traffic and streetcars. By the end of the 19th century, the narrow Newkirk Viaduct was a roadway bottleneck. \\"Much of the traffic that would naturally cross the river at Gray's Ferry has been diverted to the South Street bridge because of the congested conditions that exist from morning until night at the railroad crossing,\\" wrote the Philadelphia Record in 1900. \\"The steep incline at the western end of the old bridge has always been an obstacle to heavily-laden wagons, and at times during the day the crush of teams is actually dangerous.\\" In December 1896, the city of Philadelphia appropriated $400,000 to build the new Grays Ferry Bridge (it ultimately cost about $475,000). The appropriation was authorized by ordinance the following April. The stonework was completed in December 1898 by Jutte and Foley Company of Pittsburgh for $250,000. The five river piers were excavated to bedrock, as were most of the bridge's abutments and pedestals. The masonry was \\"rockfaced ashlar, with coping and bridge seats of Port Deposit granite.\\" The metal superstructure, plus a timber fender on the eastern side of the west draw channel and a cluster of wooden pilings at the north end of the west draw pier, were built by the Phoenix Bridge Company, which completed its work on March 1, 1901, under a $145,959.98 contract. The pavement, railings, and \\"other appurtenances\\" were completed May 20, by the Alcatraz Paving Company for $66,870. The bridge was 1,190 feet long, including 1,660 feet of metal superstructure, with a 36-foot-wide roadway and two 10-foot-wide sidewalks. It also held two trolley tracks belonging to the Union Traction Company, \\"connecting the Spruce and Pine streets division with the Darby lines on Woodland Avenue at Gray's Ferry road.\\" The west end was far higher than the old Newkirk Viaduct, for it crossed over the 14-track PW&B; railyard. River traffic was accommodated by a 223-foot, 6-inch swing span that allowed 75 feet of open water to each side of its central pier. The span could open in just one minute, thanks to electric motors powered by cables under the river (a backup system required 12 men to crank for 10 minutes against \\"a moderate wind\\"), although its 22-foot clearance allowed police and fireboats to pass without opening. The bridge opened on March 9, 1901, releasing the railroad from the obligation to maintain the highway portion of its Newkirk Viaduct, and the PW&B; promptly closed the road.West Philadelphia Illustrated: Early History of West Philadelphia and Its Environs, Its People, and Its Historical Points (1903) Under the deal, the railroad gave back the $55,000 it had received for perpetual maintenance under the agreement of 1847, and $20,000 for city-funded improvements to the Viaduct over the years. By January 1, 1902, the draw had been opened 2,653 times for the passage of 4,969 ships and boats. A 1902 U.S. Geologic Survey report called the area \\"Grays Ferry\\" without the apostrophe.Water Resources of the Philadelphia District, p.54 =PW&B; No. 1 (1902-2018) = PW&B; Bridge No. 1, shown here in 2011, replaced the Newkirk Viaduct for rail traffic in 1902. The railroad promptly began construction of a one-track bridge, completed in October 1902. This bridge has a swing span pivoting on a cylindrical stone pier at mid-stream, flanked by a approach span on either side. A wooden pile fender protects the pivot pier and the opened swing span from collisions with boat traffic on the river. On April 14, 1945, the funeral train carrying the body of President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed over the bridge, where mourners gathered to watch its passage. In 1976, Conrail abandoned the bridge shortly after it acquired the Pennsylvania Railroad properties and left it permanently open. An unknown party purchased the bridge in 1987. For decades, the bridge and the fender pilings sat unused and deteriorating. In 2012, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter proposed to return the bridge to service as a part of the Schuylkill River Trail, a bike trail. In 2017, Conrail and CSX transferred ownership of the bridge to the City of Philadelphia, which plans a $13 million project to replace the truss with a bike-trail structure. On August 23, 2018, the bridge's truss and superstructure were demolished. The pilings remained as a foundation for the planned bike-pedestrian bridge. =Grays Ferry Avenue Bridge (1976-present) = Today's Grays Ferry Avenue Bridge (July 2010 photo)In 1976, the Pennsylvania State Highway Agency built a highway bridge to replace the 1901 structure. The new bridge was erected between the old road bridge and the PW&B; railroad bridge. The bridge carries Grays Ferry Avenue across the river and the Northeast Corridor main line. Built of steel girders, it has four traffic lanes and two pedestrian sidewalks. There are also \\"painted, unbuffered bike lanes, but high prevailing speeds on the immediately adjacent motor vehicle lanes and significant debris in the bike lanes make the bike lanes uncomfortable for many bicyclists,\\" said a 2012 City of Philadelphia report. In 2007, PennDOT recorded average daily traffic volume of around 30,000 motor vehicles. In late 2018, PennDOT launched a two-year, $13.3 million project to rehab the bridge. The work was designed by Modjeski and Masters of Philadelphia, carried out by Buckley & Company of Philadelphia, and managed by TRC Solutions of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The work includes \\"extensive rehabilitation work began on the bridge, including \\"repairing the structure and substructure of the bridge, replacing expansion joints, resurfacing the bridge deck, and milling and paving the approaches on Grays Ferry Avenue from 48th Street to 35th Street.\\" A 10-foot, barrier‚Äêseparated lane for cyclists and pedestrians is being created on the eastbound side of the bridge.

Its six buildings and cemetery are on a lot on South Broadway (US 9) just south of the village center. The current church is the third building on a spot that has been home to what was originally a Reformed congregation since 1796. It is one of several Lutheran churches in the area that trace their roots to Palatine German emigrants in the early 18th century. Its late 19th-century brick building is a sophisticated application of the Romanesque Revival architectural style by a New York City architect. In 1998 the entire complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Recently, it has considered selling and demolishing some of the buildings due to financial difficulties. Property The church's property is bounded by South Broadway on the west, Fisk Street to the north, Elizabeth Street in the east and a residence on the south. It is a complex of six buildings, four of which are in a row along the street with the 10 acre (4 ha), and two with the cemetery in the rear. All are considered contributing resources to its historic character. In addition to the main entrances on Broadway there is an entry from Fisk Lane. The land is open with some mature trees. =Church= The church itself is located third from north. It is an asymmetrical brick building with cross-gabled roof topped by a cupola. Windows and doors are in rounded arches. The western (front) facade has a large, detailed rose window with quatrefoil tracery. Below it are three small stained glass windows with sandstone voussoirs. Another small window is above the rose window, in the tympanum. The main entrance is at a small one-story flat-roofed stone porch, with its archivolts likewise in sandstone. A similar porch and secondary entrance are on the northwest corner, at the base of the bell tower. It rises to a broached top with round-arched openings on all four sides and a rounded copper-roofed stair turret. Below the east gable is a steep, conical roof over the cellar entrance near the sanctuary. Inside, the church has plaster walls, wainscoting and deeply recessed windows and doors. Sail vaults support the ceiling, supported by corbels and smaller vaults rising from the columns. With the corrugated metal ceiling, the overall effect suggests a tambour. The floor is laid out following the late 19th-century Akron Plan. Pews are arranged in a semicircle on a sloping floor throughout the transept and nave. Baptismal and choral daises are in the southern corners and the altar is under a raised semidome. =Other buildings= Just north of the church is the parsonage, a Queen Anne-style two-and-a-half-story house with high-pitched roof and wraparound porch. To its north is the parish hall, a Victorian Gothic frame house, whose steeply pitched roof is complemented by a bracketed cornice and pointed-arch windows. On the south end of the row of church buildings is the cemetery caretaker's home, the oldest building on the property. It is a five- bay, one-and-a-half-story frame saltbox house. To the rear of the front row are a small wooden barn, with cross-gabled metal roof and sliding front doors, currently used as a garage. The cemetery office nearby is a one-story frame building with gabled roof and garage doors. =Cemetery= The cemetery takes up the rear of the lot. It is mostly flat, with some undulation near the east side. Several paved and unpaved lanes cross it to provide vehicular access to graves, dividing it into 20 sections, their routes corresponding to former lot boundaries. The earliest gravestone is dated 1813. It is one of a few marble and sandstone markers from that era. Victorian-era marble and granite headstones predominate in five other sections, with the remainder being from the 20th century. There is one zinc marker, and a few vaults. None of the individual gravestones are remarkable for their funerary art or the person buried. History Lutheranism came to northwestern Dutchess County in the 1710s, with Palatine German refugees from the War of Spanish Succession. After an attempt to cultivate naval stores on the lands of Robert Livingston in today's Columbia County, they were released. Some settled in the Rhinebeck and Red Hook areas at the invitation of another large local landholder, Henry Beekman. The Germans established a joint Reformed-Lutheran Church in the Red Hook community in 1715. In 1729 the Lutherans left, either due to a dispute with their Calvinist countrymen or because their congregation had grown enough to require its own church. They established what is today known as the Old Stone Church on the Albany Post Road (today's Route 9) between the two communities. The Reformed-Lutheran Church then became known as the Zion German Reformed Church. That church bought a five-acre (2 ha) plot in Red Hook at the current location in 1796 and moved in six years later. At that time the building now used as the caretaker's cottage was the only improvement, having been constructed a few years before. The congregation built a frame church that was completed the next year. Whether the cemetery was established prior to its earliest known burial, in 1813, is not known. The frame church blew down during a storm in 1834 and a new church was built of stone. A new church in a figurative sense came along in 1846, when the congregation was unable to find a pastor. To resolve the problem, they became Lutherans and became known as St. Paul's. In the 1880s the complex began to expand with the construction of the parish hall on the north end of the property. Two years later, the congregation's growth led to a fundraising drive for another new church. The stone church was demolished in 1889, as worshippers began digging a new cellar. The current church was built for $18,650 ($ in contemporary dollars) and opened the following year. It was designed by New York City architect Lawrence B. Valk, who had written extensively about church design in an 1873 book, Church Architecture. He said that \\"churches are for the salvation of souls, not for architectural display at the sacrifice of comfort\\". Most of his other churches are closer to the city, in New York, Ossining or Long Island. His church in rural Red Hook is not any different from his urban churches of the period. It is most similar to the Congregational Church of Patchogue, where he also used the very contemporary Romanesque Revival style and a similar plan. The early 20th century brought the parsonage to the property, in 1903. Three years later the church building was outfitted with electric light, and carpeting and a new pipe organ came in subsequent years. In 1914 the congregation petitioned a New York court for a name change to the current corporate name, reflecting the church's origins as the Zion German Reformed Church. The cemetery grew enough that in the 1920s the office and barn were acquired, the last contributing resources on the property. It became necessary to acquire more land, and several adjoining parcels were bought until the church's land reached its present size in 1939. There have been a few alterations since then. Work on the cellar in 1956 led to the removal of an original porte coch√®re and the addition of an endwall chimney on the south side. The original slate roof was replaced in the 1970s. By the early 21st century the church was struggling financially, and found that by April 2009 it would be broke. In 2008 it proposed to the village that it demolish the caretaker's cottage and parish hall in order to resubdivide the property and create five new buildable lots. The proceeds from doing so would help keep the cemetery and church functioning. Local preservationists objected, saying that the caretaker's cottage was \\"organic to the site\\" and should be moved, not demolished.

At that point Governor Long in the last year of his own gubernatorial term named Gleason's widow, Mary Smith Gleason, to finish the term. The Thompsons are interred at Doyline Cemetery.

Teacher evaluation study In 2011, Bellwood-Antis School District agreed to participate in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several York County school districts are participating. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, participating school districts will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator's official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. There are meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.Mason, Angie., Educators: New teacher evaluation system is a lot of talk -- but so far that's good, \\"The York Daily Record, April 29, 2012 Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 98 pupils or 7.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 31% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 96 pupils or 7.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Bellwood-Antis School District received a $726,698 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 =Gifted education= The district administration reported that 26 or 1.92% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2011, the average teacher salary in Bellwood-Antis School District was $52,763.10 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $16,762.69 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $69,525.79. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In May 2011, the Bellwood-Antis school board approved a one-year wage freeze Tuesday for its teachers and the administrative staff. The freeze is predicted to save the taxpayers about $278,060. In 2009, the district reported employing 224 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $56,675 and a top salary of $116,887. The teacher's work day is 7 hours 30 minutes with 186 days in the contract year. Teachers have a duty-free, daily preparation period. Extra compensation is paid for work required after the regular work hours. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, 3 paid personal days, 3 bereavement leave days, 10 paid sick days, health insurance in retirement, and other benefits. Bellwood- Antis School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $772.42 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob.., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. In 2008, Bellwood-Antis School District administration reported that per pupil spending was $11,306 which ranked 365th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010, the per pupil spending had increased to $11,495.58 Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a balance of zero in an unreserved- designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $898,153. In 2010, Area Administration reported an increase to $734,636.00 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In December 2009, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the School Board and the district's administration. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 1%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, local services tax, per capita taxes, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. =State basic education funding= For the 2012-13 school year, the district will receive $6,719,010. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. The state will also provide $544.4 million for School Employees‚Äô Social Security and $856 million for School Employees‚Äô Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year. In 2011-12, the district received a $6,639,648 allocation of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $79,362 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount was a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 882 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.48% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $6,974,066. Among the districts in Blair County, the highest increase went to Hollidaysburg Area School District which got a 4.26% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2.49% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $6,805,232. Among the districts in Blair County, the highest increase went to Spring Cove School District which got a 4.68% increase. The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $6,639,648.40. Ninety Pennsylvania public school districts received the base 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state's education budget proposal. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000. This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.U.S. Census Bureau., Annual Survey of Local Government Finances., 2000U.S. Census Bureau., 2008 Survey of Local Government Finances ‚Äì School Systems, 2010 According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 381 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by LEA, 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $215,409 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide teacher training, after school tutoring, and to pay teachers to write New Curriculum and Course Offerings. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Bellwood-Antis School District was denied for funding by the PDE 2006-07. In 2007-08, the Bellwood-Antis School District administration did not apply for funding. The district received $83,441 in 2008-09. In Blair County the highest award was given to Altoona Area School District which received $597,806 over the last two years of the grant. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $2,152,901 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one half million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Environment grant= Bellwood-Antis School District received a $5,000 grant (2009) from the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters' Water Resources Education Network to support a program to develop Environmental Ambassadors of the district's Outdoor Classroom that features storm water best management practice demonstration areas, including streamside buffers, rain gardens, rain barrels, pollinator gardens, and cover crops for gardens.Hess, David E., PA Environmental Digest, May 2011 =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the school board at 98.7148 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 96.4012 mills. *2010-11 - 92.3250 mills *2009-10 - 115.3000 mills. *2008-09 - 110.3000 mills. *2007-08 - 104.0000 mills. *2006-07 - 99.0000 mills. *2005-06 - 94.0000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Bellwood-Antis School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.5%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, Bellwood-Antis School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Bellwood-Antis School Board applied for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index due to increasing teacher pension costs. Each year, the Bellwood-Antis School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Bellwoord-Antis School Board applied for multiple exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011: Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources, and teacher pension costs. For the 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2012, Bellwood-Antis School District approved homestead residents received $164. In 2010, property tax relief for 2,202 approved residents of Bellwood-Antis School District was set at $161.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2010 In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Bellwood-Antis School District was also $168 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,141 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Blair County, the highest tax relief went to Williamsburg Community School District which was set at $216.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Blair County, 53.16% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery. Property tax rebates are increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009.

The Alderney camps were prison camps built and operated by Nazi Germany during its World War II occupation of the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles to be occupied. When a team of specialists came to Alderney to investigate, the Alderney Government shut it down, saying they would not allow them to carry on. Four camps The Nazis built four labour camps on Alderney. The Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) operated each subcamp and used forced labour to build fortifications in Alderney including bunkers, gun emplacements, air raid shelters, tunnels and concrete fortifications. The camps commenced operating in January 1942. They were named after the Frisian Islands. The four camps on the island had a total inmate population that fluctuated but is estimated at about 6,000.

Borkum camp was used for German technicians and \\"volunteers\\" from different countries of Europe. Helgoland camp was used for Russian Organisation Todt workers. =Two concentration camps= The other two camps became concentration camps when they were handed over to be run by the SS from 1 March 1943, they became subcamps of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg: * Lager Norderney * Lager Sylt The prisoners in Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. Sylt camp held Jewish enforced labourers. Norderney camp housed European (mainly Eastern but including Spanish) and Russian enforced labourers. The Lager Sylt commandant, Karl Tietz had a black French colonial as an under officer. A German naval officer, shocked to see a black man beating up white men from the camp, threatened to shoot the colonial officer if he saw him doing it again. Tietz was brought before a court-martial in April 1943 and sentenced to 18 months' penal servitude for the crime of selling on the black market after he sold cigarettes, watches, and valuables he had bought from Dutch OT workers. In March 1943, Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and Lager Sylt, holding Jews, were placed under the control of the SS, with SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Max List commanding. Deaths Alderney concentration camps memorial plaque More than 700 camp inmates lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. There are 397 known graves in Alderney. Apart from malnutrition, accidents and ill treatment, there were losses on ships bringing OT workers to or taking them from Alderney. In January 1943 there was a big storm and two ships, the Xaver Dorsch and the Franks, anchored in Alderney harbour were blown ashore onto the beach, they contained about 1,000 Russian OT workers. Kept locked in the holds for two weeks whilst the ships were salvaged resulted in a number of deaths. On 4 July 1944 the Minotaure an ocean going tug sailing from Alderney to St Malo with about 500 OT workers was hit three times by torpedoes but somehow managed to stay afloat, some 250 died with the ship being towed into St Malo. Two of the escort vessels, V-208 (Walther Darr√©) and V-210 (Hinrich Hey) were sunk. Documents from the ITS Archives in Germany show prisoners of numerous nationalities were incarcerated in Alderney, with many dying on the island. The causes of death included suicide, pneumonia, being shot, heart failure and explosions. Detailed death certificates were filled out and the deaths were reported to OT in St Malo.

It is the simplest aromatic sulfonic acid. It forms white deliquescent sheet crystals or a white waxy solid that is soluble in water and ethanol, slightly soluble in benzene and insoluble in nonpolar solvents like diethyl ether. It is often stored in the form of alkali metal salts. Its aqueous solution is strongly acidic. Preparation Benzenesulfonic acid is prepared from the sulfonation of benzene using concentrated sulfuric acid: :Aromatic sulfonation of benzene This conversion illustrates aromatic sulfonation, which has been called \\"one of the most important reactions in industrial organic chemistry\\". Reactions Benzenesulfonic acid exhibits the reactions typical of other aromatic sulfonic acids, forming sulfonamides, sulfonyl chloride, and esters. The sulfonation is reversed above 220 ¬∞C. Dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide gives benzenesulfonic acid anhydride ((C6H5SO2)2O). Conversion to the corresponding benzenesulfonyl chloride (C6H5SO2Cl) is effected with phosphorus pentachloride. It is a strong acid, being almost fully dissociated in water. Benzenesulfonic acid and related compounds undergo desulfonation when heated in water near 200 ¬∞C. The temperature of desulfonation correlates with the ease of the sulfonation: :C6H5SO3H + H2O ‚Üí C6H6 \\\\+ H2SO4 Because of that, sulfonic acids are usually used as a protecting group, or as a meta director in electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Relying on the 11th Red Army of Soviet Russia operating in neighboring Azerbaijan, the Bolsheviks attempted to take control of a military school and government offices in the Georgian capital of Tiflis on May 3. The Georgian government suppressed the disorders in Tiflis and concentrated its forces to successfully block the advance of the Russian troops on the Azerbaijani-Georgian border. The Georgian resistance, combined with an uneasy war with Poland, persuaded the Red leadership to defer their plans for Georgia's Sovietization and recognize Georgia as an independent nation in the May 7 treaty of Moscow.Kazemzadeh, Firuz (1951), The Struggle for Transcaucasia, 1917‚Äì1921, pp. 296, 314.

Harvard University Press  Background  After their failure to secure the control of government in Georgia following the Russian Revolution of 1917, most of the Bolshevik Georgian leaders relocated to Soviet Russia, from where they guided underground activities aimed at undermining the Menshevik-dominated government in Tiflis. A series of attempts to lead a peasant revolution against the Mensheviks were rendered abortive from 1918 to 1919, but preparations for a larger-scale revolt had been set in motion. The overthrow of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan by the Red Army in April 1920 created a precedent for the Bolsheviks in Georgia. Georgia had been in a defense alliance with Azerbaijan since 1919, but the Menshevik government hesitated to get involved in the conflict. In his April 30 speech, Georgian Premier Noe Zhordania stated that his country had been prepared to come to aid to Azerbaijan provided that the latter's own people fought for their independence. But as the Reds met minimal resistance in Baku, the Georgian government chose not to, a decision that was heavily criticized by the opposition.Avalov, Zurab (1940), The Independence of Georgia in International Politics, p. 261. London: Headley Brothers In conclusion, Zhordania declared that Georgia, if attacked, would defend its independence.  Attempted coup  Sergo Ordzhonikidze, a Bolshevik commissar with the Red Army in the Caucasus and close ally of Joseph Stalin, tried to persuade the Russian leader Lenin to allow an advance into Georgia. On May 1, the Georgian government ordered mobilization and appointed General Giorgi Kvinitadze, Director of the Tiflis Military College, as commander-in- chief. The Bolsheviks in Georgia, fully confident that the Red Army would continue its march into Georgia, no longer hesitated. Following the restive May 1 International Workers' Day manifestations and unrest in Tiflis, the Bolsheviks formed and supported armed groups to take control of government buildings. On the night of May 2-3, some 25 Bolshevik fighters attacked the Tiflis Military College as a preliminary step to taking power. General Kvinitadze was still in residence there, and he and his cadets resisted, killing and wounding several attackers. Afterwards, the ringleaders, three Armenian Bolsheviks, were court-martialed and executed. The attempt to take power had failed and Bolsheviks were rounded up throughout Tiflis and other Georgian towns.  Border clashes  In the meantime, the Red Army, upon reaching the Georgian-Azerbaijani frontier, continued to advance into Georgian territory apparently on Ordzhonikidze's own initiative. Having successfully dealt with the unrest in Tiflis, the Georgian government concentrated all its forces on the border with Azerbaijan and repulsed the Red Army detachments, staging a counter-offensive. The Russian government tried to maintain that this fighting was a local conflict between Georgia and Soviet Azerbaijan. Facing renewed hostilities with Poland, the Soviets concluded that under the circumstances it would cost too much to open a second front and occupy Georgia. Lenin decided for the moment to give up the attempt and agreed on negotiations for which the Georgian delegation had been in Moscow since late April, days before the attempted invasion. On May 7, 1920, Russia and Georgia signed a treaty of mutual recognition.Figes, Orlando (1998 reprint), A People's Tragedy: the Russian Revolution, 1891‚Äì1924, p. 714.

It remains involved in the activities of the International Labour Organization, acting as Secretariat to the Employers' Group, as well as representing business in international forums, including the G20 intergovernmental process on labour and social policy. It describes itself as \\"the largest network of the private sector in the world\\" and \\"the global voice of business\\". History The International Organisation of Employers was founded in March 1920 in London, where the Governing Body of the International Labour Office had organised a meeting. The original name of the organisation was the International Organisation of Industrial Employers (IOIE). The first member organisations of the IOIE were the Central Industrial Council of Belgium, the General Council of French Manufacturers, the Federation of British Industries, the Italian Confindustria, the Spanish Employers' Organisation, the Latin American Employers' Organisation, and other, more local organisations.\\"The International Organisation of Employers\\" Oechslin, p.26-34 In 1938, IOIE revised its statutes and became the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) to include employers beyond those in the industrial sector. The most recent version of the IOE Statutes dates to 2019 when amendments were adopted by the General Council to reflect evolving circumstances. Governance IOE‚Äôs governance structure consists of three components: the General Council, composed of all members worldwide; the Management Board, which is elected by and represents members; and the Secretariat in Geneva, at the centre of IOE‚Äôs operations. Each has specific roles and responsibilities. The supreme decision-making body of IOE is the General Council, which brings together delegates from the membership organisations. It meets at least once a year and is responsible for approving the work of the Management Board, which formulates the general policy direction of IOE, adopts a plan of action for the next year and assesses the previous year's work. The Secretariat, the body responsible for the day-to-day running of IOE, is led by the Secretary- General, currently Roberto Su√°rez Santos, who is accountable to the General Council and the Management Board.\\"Statutes of the International Organisation of Employers\\" Vision, mission and values Its vision is to create a sustainable economic environment around the world, in collaboration with members and partners, that promotes free enterprise and is fair and beneficial to both business and society. Its mission is to serve its members, by fighting and advocating for the interests of employers and business in international policy debates.

A version with English-Tagalog lyrics, recorded in 1964, was a hit in the United States and continues to be popular in Filipino communities on American soil. One of the most popular examples of the kundiman genre, this \\"classic Filipino love song\\"\\"They gladly obliged and belted out, a capella 'to the delight of everybody around' the classic Filipino love song, 'Dahil Sa Iyo!'\\" with original Tagalog lyrics has been translated into different languages. The languages it was translated in include English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and other local languages of the Philippines. Representing an earlier era remembered in nostalgia, it is one of the most popular songs in Tagalog, and a favorite in the Philippines as well as among Filipino communities in Honolulu, on the American West Coast,\\"Filipino seniors took center stage to sing 'Dahil sa iyo,' the old Tagalog love song that captured another time in Manilatown.\\" and in places like Virginia Beach, Virginia.\\"The seniors swoon when he [that is, Senator Mark Earley] launches into a rendition of the romantic 'Dahil Sa Iyo.'\\" Its popularity in the Philippines is such that some think it ought to replace the current national anthem, and that it be played if former American president Barack Obama had made a state visit to the Philippines. It has been covered many times and is a standard on the repertoire of many artists performing Filipino romantic and popular music. The song's canonical status as a classic Filipino love song was again confirmed by its inclusion on the 2004 hit compilation album Great Filipino Love Songs. The song is a personal favourite of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, wife of President Ferdinand Marcos. She would sing it frequently: as a duet with her husband in public gatherings, during her 1992 presidential bid, and performed it as late as July 2000 to wounded soldiers in the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center in Quezon City. In 2008, the song was still associated with her in Manila: \\"Suddenly, the heads of Peninsula Hotel lobby guests swiveled. Imelda Marcos had walked in. Without missing a beat, hotel musicians struck up 'Dahil sa Iyo.'\\" The song is known in the United States because of the Filipino-English lyrics by Tom Spinosa and Mike Velarde Jr. It was recorded by Cora and Santos Beloy, and released in 1964 by Tri-World Records.Video available at This rendition of the song has a 1964 copyright owned by Dexter Music Co. The original composer, Miguel Velarde, Jr., said: \\"Sometime in 1960 a famous US singer who made a personal appearance in Manila presented me a contract seeking authority to record 'Dahil Sa Iyo' in the States. The five figure offer was fabulous but I turned it down - simply because she wanted to change the title to an American title. I couldn't, and wouldn't sell the identity we are trying hard to establish. The merits of the song is its identity.'\\" This song was famously performed by Nat King Cole at the Araneta Coliseum (now SMART Araneta Coliseum) in Quezon City in 1961.Video available at This was also sung by Jerry Vale with English title \\"Your Love Is Mine\\" (Eng. lyrics by Sonny Burke) on his album The Language of Love on Columbia Records, released in 1963.

The fort was named for Thomas G. Stevenson, a Civil War general who was killed in the Battle of Spotsylvania. It was built in 1867 and abandoned in 1883. Life at the fort features heavily in the memoir of R√©gis de Trobriand, the commander of the fort. He describes interactions with the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes, and their hostilities with another group of tribes, the Sioux. The fort was abandoned in 1883 with the sale of all buildings and property. In 1901 the lands encompassing the Fort Stevenson Military Reservation were sold to Black and Associates, a group of eastern businessmen. The group originally planned to raise sugar beets on the acreages but instead dropped those plans and sold off much of the land to adjacent landowners. Several buildings remained on the site until the 1940s. The location was inundated by the rising waters of Garrison Reservoir, later renamed Lake Sakakawea, in the late 1950s and today is under about 120 feet of water. The site was located about nine miles southwest of the city of Garrison, ND. Fort Stevenson State Park, located on the shores of Lake Sakakawea about 4 miles from the original fort's location, includes a replica of the fort's guardhouse, constructed in 2003, which serves as a museum and information center relating to the old military installation.

The novel was published in the English market under the title The Postman. It tells the story of Mario Jim√©nez, a fictional postman in revolution-era Chile, who befriends the real-life poet Pablo Neruda. The novel is based on the motion picture of the same author released in 1983,Burning Patience, IMDB and it was turned into another movie in 1995 as Il Postino, directed by Michael Radford. It was also turned in an opera, Il Postino, by Daniel Cat√°n, with Pl√°cido Domingo portraying Pablo Neruda (premiered at the Los Angeles Opera, 2010). Synopsis The story opens in June, 1969 in the little village of Isla Negra, on the coast of Chile. Mario Jim√©nez, a timid teenager, rejects the profession of his father, a fisherman, and instead takes a job as the local postman. Despite the entire village being illiterate, he does have one local to deliver to‚Äîthe poet, Pablo Neruda, who is living in exile. Mario worships Neruda as a hero and buys a volume of his poetry, timidly waiting for the moment to have it autographed. After some time, Mario garners enough courage to strike up a conversation with Neruda, who is waiting for word about his candidacy for the Nobel Prize for literature, and despite an awkward beginning, the two become good friends. Neruda fuels Mario's interest in poetry by teaching him the value of a metaphor, and the young postman begins practising this technique. In the village, Mario meets Beatriz Gonz√°lez, the daughter of the local barkeep, Rosa. Beatriz is curt and distant from Mario, and the young man finds his tongue tied whenever he tries to speak to her. With Neruda's help as a poet and an influential countryman, Mario overcomes his shy nature and he and Beatriz fall in love, much to the dismay of Rosa, who banishes Beatriz from seeing Mario. Neruda's matters are complicated when he is nominated for candidacy as the president of the Chilean Communist Party, but returns to the village when the nomination turns to Salvador Allende. Neruda tries in vain to deter Rosa's negative attitude towards Mario. Months later, when a clandestine meeting between Beatriz and Mario turns to intercourse, Beatriz discovers she is pregnant and the two are married, much to the dismay of Rosa. Neruda leaves to become the ambassador to France, and as he leaves, he gives Mario a leather-bound volume of his entire works. National workers enter the village to install electricity, and Rosa's bar becomes a restaurant for the workers. As Neruda is gone, Mario is no longer needed as the postman, but takes on a job as the cook in the restaurant. Some months pass and Mario receives a package from Neruda containing a Sony tape recorder. Neruda is homesick (and it is implied otherwise ill), and asks his friend to record the sounds of his homeland to send back to him. Among other things, Mario records the tiny heartbeat of his yet unborn child. Secretly, Mario has saved enough money to purchase a ticket to visit Neruda in France, but matters change when his son is born and the money is spent on the child as he grows. It is announced that Neruda has won the Nobel Prize and Mario celebrates with the rest of the village by throwing a party at Rosa's restaurant. Neruda returns some time later, quite ill. Mario considers sending a poem into a contest for the cultural magazine, La Quinta Rueda, and seeks Neruda's help with the work. Neruda, unbeknownst to Mario, however, is on his death bed. Unable to see Neruda, Mario decides to send in a pencil sketch of his son. The revolution reaches Isla Negra, and Mario takes up his job as postman in order to see Neruda. As helicopters circle the area, Mario sneaks into Neruda's house, to find the poet dying in his bed. Mario reads to Neruda telegrams that he has received offering the poet sanctuary, but it is too late‚ÄîNeruda knows he is dying and gives his last words, a poem, to Mario. Neruda is taken away in an ambulance and dies in the hospital several days later. Shortly after Neruda's death, Mario is approached by Labb√©, the local right-wing general. The general asks Mario to come with him for some routine questioning. As Mario gets into the car, he overhears on the radio that several subversive magazines have been taken over by coup forces, including La Quinta Rueda. In an epilogue, the author talks to one of the editors of La Quinta Rueda. The editor remembers who the winner would have been‚Äîa poem by Jorge Teillier. When the author asks about Mario's sketch, the editor has no memory of it. The author ends the story by sipping a cup of bitter coffee.

The mathematician Gauss used the summit of the Hau√üelberg as one of the triangulation stations for his land surveys, triangulating it to the Falkenberg, AMSL,AMSL = above mean sea level or, more specifically, above the European datum, Normalnull further west near Wardb√∂hmen and to the Wilseder Berg, AMSL, to the north.Overview of the survey triangulation systems in North Germany Another triangle was formed by the Hau√üelberg, the Falkenberg and Breithorn (Breitenhorn), AMSL, south of Unterl√º√ü.

History =Monastery= Legend holds that the area, in Moorish times, was honeycombed with caves made by potters for ovens and to obtain clay, and that after the capture of the city by Christians in the thirteenth century, an image of the virgin was revealed inside one of the caves, where supposedly it had been hidden. It prompted the construction of a chapel of Santa Mar√≠a de las Cuevas to house the venerated icon. In the 15th century, the archbishop of Seville, aided by the noble family of Medina, helped found a Franciscan monastery at the site. Later constructions were patronized by don Peraf√°n de Ribera (who built the Casa de Pilatos). In the 15th century, monks of the cloistered order of Saint Bruno were housed in the monastery. Christopher Columbus' remains were first interred at Valladolid, then at the Monastery of the Cartuja by the will of his son Diego. In 1542 the remains were transferred to Colonial Santo Domingo. During the Napoleonic invasion, the monastery was sacked and used as barracks.

Commencing production in 1841, Pickman established innovative manufacturing methods such as importing raw materials, the use of molds, using specialised machinery, mechanical arms and presses, utilising British ceramist experience while employing pottery workers from nearby Triana.

Charles Pickman is also distinguished by his admission to the Most Noble Order of the British Garter, which is used as a trademark in some models from the factory.https://lacartujadesevilla.com/gb/content/6-Historyhttp://www.eyeonspain.com/blogs/jesuscastro/3433/charles- pickman-christopher-columbus-and-seville.aspx Production continued until 1984. The bottle shaped kilns and tall chimney are the legacy of the ceramics factory. =National Monument and museum of contemporary art= Inside the entrance gateway In 1964, the monastery was declared a national monument, and now is owned by the government of Andalusia, which create a new institution called \\"Monumental Ensemble of the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de las Cuevas\\". Restorations were made for the Seville Expo '92, directed by Bartolom√© Ruiz Gonz√°lez, the first and only one director of the Monumental Ensemble from 1989 to 1994. In 1997, the older part of the monastery became the site of a museum of contemporary art, the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo (CAAC).http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/cultura/caac/english/inf/abo.htm The Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo (CAAC) Approach through courtyard Rose window to chapel The Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo (CAAC) was created in February 1990 with the aim of giving the local community an institution for the research, conservation and promotion of contemporary art. In 1997 the Cartuja Monastery became the centre's headquarters. The CAAC, an autonomous organisation dependent on the Andalusian Government (Junta de Andaluc√≠a), took over the collections of the former Conjunto Monumental de la Cartuja (Cartuja Monument Centre) and the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Sevilla (Contemporary Art Museum of Seville). One of the main aims of the centre has been to develop a programme of activities attempting to promote the study of contemporary international artistic creation in all its facets. Temporary exhibitions, seminars, workshops, concerts, meetings, recitals, film cycles and lectures have been the communication tools used to fulfil this aim. The permanent collection includes pieces by Luis Gordillo, Candida Hofer, Rebecca Horn, Pablo Palazuelo, Joseph Kosuth and Louise Bourgeois. It focuses in particular on the history of contemporary Andalusian creativity and its relationship with other national and international artistic contexts. Since 1994 the centre has organised a series of themed exhibitions relating to different aspects of the Monastery in which pieces from its archives address relevant events in contemporary aesthetic creation. Visitors to the museum may also see the historical grounds of the former monastery which includes the old chain door, atrium, chapels of Santa Catalina, San Bruno, Santa Ana, Profundis and la Magdalena, the priory cell, church, the sacristy, cloisters, monks' chapter, refectory, gardens and orchards.http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/cultura/caac/english/inf/abo.htm External links *History of La Cartuja de Sevilla *The Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo (CAAC) *Museo de la Cer√°mica de Triana, Sevilla.

Education Judge Grimm attended the University of California, Davis, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Classical Rhetoric in 1973, summa cum laude. While at Davis, Judge Grimm was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Reserve Officer Training Corps. In 1976, he received his Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from the University of New Mexico School of Law. Judge Grimm received his LLM from Duke University School of Law. Career Born in Yokohama, Japan, Grimm has had both a military and civilian career in the law. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army in 1973, he was released from service in 1979 as a captain and continued his service as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve until 2001. In active service, his legal duties included the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Fort Bliss, Texas. In 1980, as a civilian, he joined the State's Attorney's Office for Baltimore County, Maryland and shortly thereafter became an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Maryland. From 1984 until 1997, Judge Grimm worked in private practice handling commercial litigation until his appointment as United States Magistrate Judge. Judge Grimm has written numerous books and articles on subjects including electronic discovery, civil procedure, evidence and trial practice and lectures frequently on these topics. He also teaches courses on these subjects at the University of Maryland School of Law and the University of Baltimore School of Law. Federal judicial service On February 16, 2012, President Obama nominated Grimm to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. He would replace Judge Benson Everett Legg who has announced that he is taking senior status effective June 8, 2012. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on his nomination on May 9, 2012 and reported his nomination to the floor on June 7, 2012. The Senate confirmed his nomination on December 3, 2012, by a vote by 92 ayes to 1 nay, Senator Blunt casting the sole no vote. He received his commission on December 6, 2012. Awards During law school, Judge Grimm was awarded the Order of Coif and served on the Law Review. Judge Grimm has also received several military awards, including the Parachutist Badge, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Army Achievement Medal. His other awards include: *Distinguished Service Award, Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education of Lawyers (1998) *Professional Legal Excellence Award for the Advancement of Professional Competence Maryland Bar Foundation (2001) *Outstanding Adjunct Faculty Member of the Year, University of Maryland School of Law (2002 and 2006) *Maryland Leadership in Law Award, Daily Record (2004) Cases of note Judge Grimm's rulings on cases in which electronic discovery concerns were involved have advanced understanding of issues related to electronically stored information (ESI) in civil matters. *Hopson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (2005). In this widely cited 2005 opinion, Judge Grimm outlined a stop-gap formula that offered parties protection against the voluntary waiver of attorney‚Äìclient privilege or attorney work product protections due to inadvertent production of ESI in the discovery process. In so doing, however, he highlighted the unmet need for a definitive legal rule that could provide more certain, uniform guidance on the waiver of those protections. Grimm's opinion in Hopson played a direct role in the subsequent enactment in 2008 of the new Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 502, which was designed to bring more certainty and uniformity to the law of voluntary waivers of the attorney‚Äìclient privilege or work product protections in both federal and state courts. (When outlining the purposes of the new rule in the notes to FRE 502, the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules explicitly cited the Hopson opinion and Judge Grimm's concerns.) *Lorraine v. Markel (2007). In a case regarding insurance coverage for a damaged boat, Judge Grimm wrote a 52-page opinion in which he articulated the evidentiary issues to be addressed in proving whether electronic data should be admitted into evidence at trial. A July 2008 article in the ABA Journal characterized Grimm as a \\"star\\" for breaking ground in a previously unaddressed aspect of evidentiary law. *In Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe Inc. (2008), Judge Grimm found counsel had waived the attorney‚Äìclient privilege as to a group of inadvertently produced documents because, inter alia, counsel failed to satisfactorily explain their review processes. He advised that counsel should be able to provide information regarding the search method used, reasons for its selection, the qualifications of the people who designed the search, the steps taken to assess reliability and appropriateness of the search method and the quality of its implementation. In his comments, Judge Grimm discussed indicia that a reasonable search had been performed, noting that the TREC Legal Track project (a subgroup of the Text Retrieval Conference) would be a way to \\"‚Ä¶support an argument that the party employing them performed a reasonable ESI search‚Ä¶\\". *In Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services Co. (2008), a wage dispute, Judge Grimm wrote a 30-page opinion which contains a detailed examination of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(g) (certification by counsel of discovery disclosures, requests, responses or objections, formed after reasonable inquiry) and an overview of the federal rules and other law that mandate cooperation among parties in discovery, dovetailing the views presented in the Sedona Conference Cooperation Proclamation.

Wescott John Wesley Wescott (February 20, 1849 - June 11, 1927) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as Attorney General of New Jersey from 1914 to 1919. He had the distinction of making the nominating speech for Woodrow Wilson at the Democratic National Convention in both 1912 and 1916. Early life Wescott was born in Waterford Township, New Jersey in 1849 to John and Catherine (Bozarth) Wescott. He attended Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts before entering Yale College, where he graduated in 1872. He then attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1876. At Yale he was active in football, rowing, baseball, wrestling, and boxing, and also won high honors for oratory and English composition. Legal and political career After returning to New Jersey, Wescott was admitted to the bar as an attorney in 1878 and a counselor in 1881. He practiced law in Camden County, and in 1885 was appointed by Governor Leon Abbett to be Presiding Judge of the Common Pleas for the county. Wescott was a Democrat and was named a presidential elector for Grover Cleveland in 1892. In the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey in 1910, Wescott supported the candidacy of Frank S. Katzenbach, who had narrowly lost to John Franklin Fort in the previous election. Woodrow Wilson beat out Katzenbach for the Democratic nomination and won Wescott's support in his successful campaign for governor. When Wilson's name was put into nomination at the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, he sought out Wescott from the New Jersey delegation to give the nominating speech. Four years later, at the 1916 Convention in St. Louis, Wilson again selected Wescott to present his name for nomination. In 1914 Governor James F. Fielder appointed Wescott to a five-year term as Attorney General of New Jersey. His name was put forth as a Democratic candidate for United States Senate in 1914 and 1916. After World War I, Wescott was a strong advocate of President Wilson's attempts to have the United States enter the League of Nations. He was the head of the group Woodrow Wilson Democracy and promoted a pro-League of Nations plank in the Democratic Party platform at the 1924 Convention. Death In 1927 Wescott died at his home in Haddonfield, New Jersey at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife, Francis Marie Louise Leclerc Prior (married January 1, 1875), and his three sons Henry D. (born 1876), Ethan P. (born 1881), and Ralph W. (born 1883), all lawyers.

Biography Dalia Dorner (n√©e Dolly Greenberg) was born in Istanbul, Turkey. Her father, a wood merchant, Levy Greenberg, immigrated there from Odessa. Her family immigrated once again in 1944, this time to Mandatory Palestine, where her father died shortly after. Her mother sent her to a Youth Aliyah boarding school in Nahariya, from which she continued to the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa. During her compulsory service in the IDF, she started her law studies in Tel Aviv. There she met her future husband, Shmuel. They married in 1958 and have two sons, Ariel Levy Bendor (b. 1963) and Amir Eliezer (b. 1965). After the army, she completed her law studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Legal career Dorner worked for the Israel Police for a period, and then re-enlisted as an IDF officer in the Military Advocate General, rising up through the ranks to the position of Chief Military Defense. In 1974 she was appointed as a judge on the Military Court of Appeals, with the rank of Colonel. She was the first Israeli woman not serving in the Israeli Women's Corps to reach the ranks of Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel. After retiring from the IDF, Dorner became a District Court Judge, first in the Southern District and later in the Jerusalem District. She was one of the judges who convicted John Demjanjuk and sentenced him to death in 1988, a decision overturned by Israel's Supreme Court, in 1993. In April 1993, she was appointed a provisional Supreme Court Justice, and a year later this position was made permanent. In her position, Dorner proved to be an ardent advocate of human rights, as was expressed in her interpretation of the Basic Laws of Israel. At the same time she was considered unforgiving to white-collar crime. Toward the end of her career as a Justice she headed the Israeli Central Elections Committee. Dorner retired from the Supreme Court on March 3, 2004. In August 2006, she was appointed president of the Israeli Press Council. She teaches human rights law at the Bar-Ilan University law faculty. She holds Honorary Doctorates from the Weizmann Institute of Science (2005), and from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (2008). She is an honorary member of the American Law Institute. Landmark rulings Dorner required the military authorities to allow personalized epitaphs on soldiers' headstones. Her ruling emphasized the individual versus the collective, observing that \\"every child is an only child to his parents.\\" She ruled that state must allocate adequate budgets to the Special Education Law to allow children with disabilities to be integrated into ordinary education frameworks. In the Jonathan Danilowitz case, she recognized the right of an El Al cabin attendant to receive a plane ticket for his homosexual partner. Dorner‚Äôs broad interpretation of free expression was illustrated in her ruling in the case of Kidum, a night school, which was permitted to use an advertising slogan with vulgar sexual connotations previously deemed unacceptable. Awards and honors In 2010, Dorner was invited to light a torch at the Israeli Independence Day ceremony on Mount Herzl.

Characteristics Low- rise apartments sometimes offer more privacy and negotiability of rent and utilities than high-rise apartments, although they may have fewer amenities and less flexibility with leases. It is easier to put fires out in low-rise buildings. Within the United States due to the legal-economic and modernist perspectives low-rises can in some cities be seen as less luxurious than high- rises, whereas within Western Europe (for historical identity and legal reasons) low-rise tends to be more attractive.

It resulted in 27 deaths, and 76 injuries. The attack had no evidence initially connected to terrorism. Fire At around 8:00 a.m. local time, a diesel bus was engulfed in flames. The number of casualties was aggravated by the rear door not opening, and firefighters and other emergency service crews being blocked 1 km from the scene by bad traffic. The exact cause of the fire was not immediately known by officials, but the diesel engines were intact and authorities quickly ruled out a mechanical glitch. Gasoline carried on board by a passenger was soon blamed, and authorities did not rule out arson as the cause as the investigation proceeded. Several passengers, including the bus driver, reported smelling gasoline, and traces of gasoline were found in the bus, which did not use gasoline as fuel. Following the government probe, investigators stated that gasoline brought on board by a passenger did indeed cause the fire, but they could not immediately determine if the fire was a deliberate act of arson or an accident. The initial probe did rule out an explosion as the cause of the fire. Pedestrians outside the bus rushed to help break the windows to allow passengers to escape. PRC national law does not require buses to maintain hammers for the purpose of breaking the windows in an emergency, but remains of three emergency hammers were found at the scene. The bus was built in February 2005 and had logged at the time of the incident. Including those who died in hospital following the incident, the total death toll was 27. Perpetrator The arsonist was later identified as 62-year-old unemployed Zhang Yunliang (), a native of Suzhou, Jiangsu, who temporarily lived in Chengdu. He had previously threatened suicide after his family reduced his financial support. The night before the arson, Zhang told his daughter he wanted to \\"die differently\\". Zhang had been addicted to gambling before arriving in Chengdu in 2006, and was dependent on the financial assistance from his daughter. Zhang was at the rear of the bus the time he burnt to death. Reactions Emergency hammer and emergency glass breaking device on Chengdu BRT The fire ultimately affected 101 families. Following the incident, Li Shuguang, the chairman of the bus company resigned, saying he hoped his resignation would \\"arouse society's attention to the safety of public transport.\\" A bus company in Chengdu promised to financially reward passengers who report others who bring flammable liquids or other prohibited items on board. The municipal governments of Beijing, Shenyang, and Guangzhou reacted by reviewing bus safety measures. Officials in Haikou outfitted public buses with 400 emergency hammers, but over half of the hammers were stolen from the buses within three days. As local hospitals were running low on blood needed for transfusions to help the victims, over 60 Chengdu citizens and 55 soldiers volunteered for blood donations after an urgent call from hospital authorities. In the days after the Chengdu bus fire, buses also caught fire in Shenzhen on June 13, in Wuhai, Inner Mongolia on June 15 and in Zhoushan, Zhejiang on June 16. There was no evidence initially of any terrorist connection, and no passengers were killed in the three other bus fires. The Shenzhen government responded to the bus fires in Chengdu and Shenzhen by declaring that the city's kindergarten buses must be equipped with GPS.

Today, the majority of Semnanis speak Persian. Throughout the Medieval era, the Semnani people were ruled by various dynasties from Tabaristan. For much of the Pre-Islamic era, the Semnani people were part of the territory of Parthia. Ever since the Seleucid era, the land became known as Comisene, the indigenous name for the province, which survives in the Semnani language as k√∂meshi.  Origins  The Semnani people are Caspians who migrated to the northern fringe of the central Iranian plateau from the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. It is not known when this migration occurred, but these Caspian- speaking tribes slowly intermixed with the tribes of the plateau, creating what has been dubbed in Persian literature as an \\"Isle of Dialects.\\" These same Caspian migrants also settled in the villages and towns of Biyabunak, Eyvanakey, Sorkheh, Garmsar, Shahmirzad, Darjezin, and Mehdishahr. The city of Semnan is the primary hub of the Semnani people, though it is unclear whether the name itself came from the people or the settlement.  Cultural Identity  Semnani books of poetry and vocabulary compilations Like many cultures of the Middle East, Semnani people emphasize kindness, compassion, and hospitality. The identity of the Semnani people is deeply intertwined with their language. The ardent desire to preserve their unique identity manifests throughout Semnani poetry. Semnani is our history Semnani is our cultural heritage Since ancient times 'til now, it has been a treasure intact It is our duty to preserve it -Parviz Pezhum Shariati The spread of Persian‚Äîand even English‚Äîhas threatened the preservation of the Semnani language. Poets, like Azim Hajj Ramazani, offer both hope and warning to the Semnani people. O Brother! The Tree of our Language is still alive and green. O Brother! Do not let this Tree dry and die whilst it still stands. Agriculture The arid plains of Iran's central desert sharply contrast with the lush, forested north of Iran, but the lack of rain did not stop the Semnani people from settling the alluvial fans and bringing the desert to life for the last thousand years. Par√∂ System; speed control The Semnani people built complex water irrigation projects to siphon snowmelt and runoff from the mountains. One such project is Par√∂, which in Semnani means the water splitter. A large channel made of stonemasonry would draw the rushing water into the city. Several large steps and ponds would reduce the speed of the runoff until the water becomes nearly stationary by the last step. From there, the water would be divided into as many channels as needed and dispatched via a system of overland and subterranean aqueducts. In pre-modern times, an engarnevis would oversee the water distribution process, keeping records of how much water has been dispatched to a particular neighborhood or agricultural district.

It was released on October 26, 2009 for SpongeBob's 10th anniversary. Altron developed a Nintendo DS version of the game. Plot SpongeBob has been entrusted by Mr. Krabs to keep the Krabby Patty formula safe. But in all the excitement, SpongeBob forgets where he put the formula. He then relies on the help of the most unlikely companion, Plankton. With the help of his friends, SpongeBob must use Plankton's memory machine to retrace the happiest moments of his life (because according to SpongeBob, he's unable to remember anything when he's sad) to find the Krabby Patty formula in time for the Krusty Krab's \\"eleventy-seventh\\" anniversary. Little does SpongeBob know, however, that Plankton wants the formula for himself and has inserted robots into SpongeBob's memories to extract the precise location of the formula. But after breaking the controller, Plankton has no choice but to go inside SpongeBob's memories instead. SpongeBob travels through his memories, fighting robots and robot bosses that look like Patrick and Squidward. He travels various environments as he relives his memories, such as getting his job as fry-cook, meeting Sandy as well as practicing karate with her, his first Christmas, his first 24-hour shift (where he's lost in Rock Bottom), jellyfishing with Patrick, meeting Mermaidman and Barnacleboy, Squidward's first Krabby Patty (where his fights Squid-Bot), and his fake fight with Patrick to get into the Salty Spittoon (where he fights Pat-Bot). He then remembers the formula is in the Krusty Krab safe. Plankton finds this out however and turns the entire Chum Bucket into one giant Plankton-Bot. After destroying it, SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs the formula is in the safe, but then finds out it was in his back pocket the whole time. However, when he gives the paper to Mr. Krabs, he realizes that he gave him his lottery ticket and that the secret formula was in Mr. Krabs' back pocket the whole time. Voices * Tom Kenny as SpongeBob and Gary * Mr. Lawrence as Plankton * Bob Joles as Mr. Krabs * Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick * Rodger Bumpass as Squidward * Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy * Ernest Borgnine as Mermaid Man * Tim Conway as Barnacle Boy  Features  Players can turn SpongeBob into a Sledgehammer Smash to whack intruders, a WaterBob sponge to spew water, a giant spatula, a spinning blade (or a spinning pirate ship steering wheel), a MuscleBob BuffPants, or even an Explosive Cannon to aim and blast baddies. Players can reminisce through fan-favorite SpongeBob moments as the game draws upon \\"The 10 Happiest Moments of SpongeBob's Life\\" and story elements from the animated television series. In multiplayer mode, players can play as SpongeBob or with a friend playing as Plankton throughout the entire game on both the Wii and Xbox 360 platforms. Each system's cover art has a SpongeBob face. However, the facial expression shown is different between covers. Two levels are exclusive to the PSP and DS versions, Bikini Bottom and The Krusty Krab. Development The game development started under the title SpongeBob SquarePants: Happiness Squared, but was later changed to tie-in with the TV special.  Reception  Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine rated the game 4 out of 10 and considered it boring, while criticizing its \\"tedious\\" levels and \\"irritating\\" camera. Common Sense Media gave it a score of 4 out of 5 stars.

In surveying, a gyrotheodolite (also: surveying gyro) is an instrument composed of a gyrocompass mounted to a theodolite. It is used to determine the orientation of true north. It is the main instrument for orientation in mine surveying and in tunnel engineering, where astronomical star sights are not visible and GPS does not work. History In 1852, the French physicist L√©on Foucault discovered that a gyro with two degrees of freedom points north. This principle was adapted by Max Schuler in 1921 to build the first surveying gyro. In 1949, the gyro-theodolite ‚Äì at that time called a \\"meridian pointer\\" or \\"meridian indicator\\" ‚Äì was first used by the Clausthal Mining Academy underground. Several years later it was improved with the addition of autocollimation telescopes. In 1960, the Fennel Kassel company produced the first of the KT1 series of gyro-theodolites. Fennel Kassel and others later produced gyro attachments that can be mounted on normal theodolites. Operation A gyroscope is mounted in a sphere, lined with Mu-metal to reduce magnetic influence, connected by a spindle to the vertical axis of the theodolite. The battery-powered gyro wheel is rotated at 20,000 rpm or more, until it acts as a north-seeking gyroscope. A separate optical system within the attachment permits the operator to rotate the theodolite and thereby bring a zero mark on the attachment into coincidence with the gyroscope spin axis. By tracking the spin axis as it oscillates about the meridian, a record of the azimuth of a series of the extreme stationary points of that oscillation may be determined by reading the theodolite azimuth circle. A midpoint can later be computed from these records that represents a refined estimate of the meridian. Careful setup and repeated observations can give an estimate that is within about 10 arc seconds of the true meridian. This estimate of the meridian contains errors due to the zero torque of the suspension not being aligned precisely with the true meridian and to measurement errors of the slightly damped extremes of oscillation. These errors can be moderated by refining the initial estimate of the meridian to within a few arc minutes and correctly aligning the zero torque of the suspension. When the spinner is released from restraint with its axis of rotation aligned close to the meridian, the gyroscopic reaction of spin and Earth‚Äôs rotation results in precession of the spin axis in the direction of alignment with the plane of the meridian. This is because the daily rotation of the Earth is in effect continuously tilting the east-west axis of the station. The spinner axis then accelerates towards and overshoots the meridian, it then slows to a halt at an extreme point before similarly swinging back towards the initial point of release. This oscillation in azimuth of the spinner axis about the meridian repeats with a period of a few minutes. In practice the amplitude of oscillation will only gradually reduce as energy is lost due to the minimal damping present. Gyro-theodolites employ an undamped oscillating system because a determination can be obtained in less than about 20 minutes, while the asymptotic settling of a damped gyro-compass would take many times that before any reasonable determination of meridian could possibly be made. When not in operation, the gyroscope assembly is anchored within the instrument. The electrically powered gyroscope is started while restrained and then released for operation. During operation the gyroscope is supported within the instrument assembly, typically on a thin vertical tape that constrains the gyroscope spinner axis to remain horizontal. The alignment of the spin axis is permitted to rotate in azimuth by only the small amount required during operation. An initial approximate estimate of the meridian is needed. This might be determined with a magnetic compass, from an existing survey network or by the use of the gyro-theodolite in an extended tracking mode. Uses Gyro-theodolites are primarily used in the absence of astronomical star sights and GPS. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyro-theodolite can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, which runs under the English Channel from France to the UK, gyro-theodolites were used to align the tunnels. Limitations Although a gyro-theodolite functions at the equator and in both the northern and southern hemispheres, it cannot be used at either the North Pole or South Pole, where the Earth's axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner and the meridian is undefined. Gyro-theodolites are not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole where the angle between the earth's rotation and the direction of gravity is too small for it to work reliably. Unlike an artificial horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyro-theodolite cannot be relocated while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site. When available, astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than one hundred times the accuracy of the gyro-theodolite. Where this extra precision is not required, the gyro-theodolite is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.

Ramos Otero's and Ferr√©'s stories were based on the life of Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer (better known as Isabel la Negra), a famous madam who ran a brothel in the city of Ponce from the 1930s to the 1960s. Ramos Otero's story was later included in his book El cuento de la Mujer del Mar (The Story of the Woman of the Sea).Ramos Otero, Manuel. \\"La √∫ltima plena que bail√≥ Luberza.\\" In El cuento de la Mujer del Mar, 47-68.

Facing firm opposition from the state's Governor Jerry Brown and denied a permit by a state agency, plans for the construction of the power facility were rejected in 1978 after 100 million dollars had been spent towards its construction. The Sundesert proposal was the last major attempt to build a nuclear plant in California. History =Background= California Governor Jerry Brown in 1978 Opposition to nuclear power plants in California began in 1958 over the proposed Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant near the small fishing town of Bodega Bay, California. The six- year controversy pitted utility company Pacific Gas and Electric against local activists opposed to the location of the nuclear plant. According to nuclear power historian Thomas Wellock, this successful fight by the activists, the first in the history of nuclear power, led directly to the eventual growth of California‚Äôs anti-nuclear movement. A second battle by state environmentalists stopped a nuclear facility proposed for Malibu, California, in the scenic oceanside Corral Canyon, in 1970. However, by the early 1970s, the future of nuclear energy in California was projected to expand on a major scale, with numerous proposals on the drafting boards of the state‚Äôs utility companies. In the mid- and late 1970s, plans envisioned as future United States energy policy by the Carter Administration called for hundreds of new nuclear plants to be built nationwide. But under Governor Jerry Brown who was elected in 1975, California was heading in the opposite direction.Coast Legislators Apparently Doom Nuclear Plant, New York Times, Gladwin Hill, April 18, 1978. Retrieved July 7, 2019. =Proposal and rejection= In 1976, after purchasing the necessary parcel of land the previous year, San Diego Gas & Electric Company submitted an application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct two 974 MWe Westinghouse pressurized water reactors approximately 15 miles southwest of Blythe, California near the border of Arizona.https://scua2.sdsu.edu/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&id;=4&q;= The location of the proposed nuclear plant was 160 miles east of the city of San Diego, and the site had been cleared for general and earthquake safety by both state and federal regulators. The cost of the twin reactor plant was to be 3 billion dollars. The two reactors were scheduled to come on line in 1985 and 1988.San Diego Gas and Electric, Sundesert Nuclear Power Plant Collection, 1974-1980, San Diego State University, Ellen Jarosz. Retrieved July 7, 2019. California had already enacted a state law in 1976 that mandated that a solution be found to the problem of safe disposal of nuclear waste before further nuclear plants could be constructed. Attempts to exempt the Sundesert plant from the law failed in what was then called the California Assembly's Resources, Land Use and Energy Committee. Additionally, statewide public disapproval of nuclear power had increased significantly. In March 1978 in California‚Äôs Kern County, voters for the first time in United States history emphatically rejected a nuclear power plant, the proposed four-reactor San Joaquin Nuclear Project, by a 70% to 30% margin. If approved and constructed, it would have been the largest nuclear power facility in the world.Price, Robert The next month, April 1978, a year before the Three Mile Island accident, Governor Brown stated he would never sign a bill allowing construction of a nuclear power plant in California. Soon afterwards the California Energy Commission voted to halt the construction of the two Sundesert units in the \\"absence of federally demonstrated and approved technology for permanent disposal of radioactive wastes\\".Luther J. Carter \\"Political Fallout from Three Mile Island\\", Science, 204, April 13, 1979, p. 154. The Sundesert project was cancelled in May 1978. Aftermath Political response to the crucial California Energy Commission vote to deny the Sundesert plant a permit was considerable from both parties. The body had been created in 1974, and all five members had been appointed by Governor Brown. There were calls to abolish the commission in the wake of the commission vote not to approve the plant. The utility most involved with the plant construction, San Diego Gas and Electric with a 50% stake, had invested 100 million dollars in the failed project. The rejection of the Sundesert plant was the last major effort to locate a new nuclear power plant in California. As of 2020, the final operational nuclear power plant in the state, the twin- reactor Diablo Canyon Power Plant facility midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is slated to be shut down no later than 2025.

Its principal operation is an assembly plant located in Luton, Vauxhall Luton, which currently produces light commercial vehicles sold under the Opel and Vauxhall marques. History IBC Vehicles has its roots in Bedford Vehicles, the van manufacturing subsidiary of Vauxhall. In 1986 the Bedford Vehicles van factory in Luton was reorganised as a joint venture with Isuzu. The resulting company was named IBC Vehicles (Isuzu Bedford Company Limited). Its first product was the Bedford Midi - a badge engineered clone of the Isuzu Fargo midsize panel van, intended to replace the ageing Bedford CF. The Suzuki-based Bedford Rascal microvan followed in 1987. In 1992 the factory produced a European version of the Isuzu Wizard aka Amigo 4WD called the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera and the Isuzu MU aka Trooper 4WD called the Opel/Vauxhall Monterey and a range of Renault-designed vans sold under the Vauxhall and Opel brand names. The Bedford name was dropped completely as were all of its preceding range apart from the Midi. The Frontera A was produced from 1992 - 1998 and the Frontera B 1998 - 2004. In 1998 GM bought Isuzu out of the IBC partnership and renamed the plant to GMM Luton. Products GMM Luton produced the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro A, Renault Trafic and Nissan Primastar from 2001 to 2014. The Hi-top roof versions were built in Barcelona, Spain by Renault at the former Nissan Plant because the Luton IBC building was not high enough to accommodate the Hi-top vehicles. By 2011, the plant had produced 1.25 million vehicles since the 2001 launch, with production now down to 68,000 vehicles a year, with a capacity for 100,000. Opel/Vauxhall announced in 2011 that the 2013 Vivaro would continue production at Luton and the high roof versions and the Renault Trafic would be manufactured at Sandouville, France.

J√≥zsef Klekl () (October 13, 1874 ‚Äì May 30, 1948) was a Slovene Roman Catholic priest from Prekmurje and politician in Hungary, writer, governor of the Slovene People's Party (Slovenska l√ºdska stranka), later a delegate in Belgrade. Klekl was an active proponent of the independence of the Slovene March in Hungary (Slovenska krajina), and for some time fusion with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.  Early life  Klekl born in Prekmurje, in Krajna, in the Vas County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The writer J√≥zsef Klekl (1879‚Äì1936), his cousin, was also born here. Because he was older, he is known as Jo≈æef Klekl Stari ('J√≥zsef Klekl Sr.') in Slovenian. His parents, Istv√°n Klekl and Ter√©z S√°lm√°n, were farmers. The Klekl family was of German descent. His grandfather Anton Klekl was born in Kellerdorf, near Radkersburg, Austria. On July 11, 1897 Klekl became a priest and chaplain to Ferenc Ivan√≥czy in Ti≈°ina. At the time, Ivan√≥czy was the governor of the Hungarian Slovenes. From 1902 to 1903 he was a chaplain in D√ºrnbach im Burgenland, and from 1903-1905 in ƒåren≈°ovci. In 1905 he became the priest in Peƒçarovci. In 1910 he retired on a pension and lived in ƒåren≈°ovci.  Political activity  In 1904 Klekl founded the Hungarian Slovene Catholic newspaper Marijin liszt. In 1914 he founded the semi-radical newspaper Novine. In this paper he took a stance against the Hungarisation of Prekmurje. In 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire was breaking up. Klekl was in connection with the Slovene politician Anton Koro≈°ec. Koro≈°ec and a few Slovene politicians backed the idea of an independent Slovene March, which would later be part of Yugoslavia. Klekl, J√≥zsef Szakovics, Iv√°n Bassa, Istv√°n K√ºh√°r, and J√≥zsef Cs√°rics worked out the Slovene March programme, but in Hungary the Bolshevik administration came to power and Serbian forces quickly annexed Prekmurje. For a long time the people of Prekmurje were angry with Klekl because he did not create an independent Slovene territory. The county of Szentgotth√°rd thus remained in Hungary and in Prekmurje the official language became Slovene, not Prekmurje Slovene.  After the First World War  After 1920, Klekl became a delegate in the Yugoslav capital. In 1941 he enlisted in the Hungarian Army. Klekl and Szakovics actively wrote and championed the standard Prekmurje Slovene in the 20th century, which was banned after 1945. Klekl died in Murska Sobota in 1948.

After World War I, the family moved to Johannesburg, where he was educated at Parktown Boys' High School and the University of the Witwatersrand. Training Married in 1934 Diana Malkin, Penn and his wife went to the United Kingdom, where he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1935. He worked successively at the Orthopaedic Centre in Liverpool, at the then new British Postgraduate School in London, as acting Senior Surgeon at a County Council hospital in London, and as Resident Surgical Officer at the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. He also spent part of 1937 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, in the United States of America, then returning, with a short spell in London, to Johannesburg, where he was offered a part-time appointment as lecturer in Clinical Anatomy by Prof. Raymond Dart at the University of the Witwatersrand. The military context: plastic and reconstructive surgery Penn enlisted as a part-time officer with the rank of major in the Union Defence Force (predecessor of the South African Defence Force), being called up in 1939 as a major attached to the 7th Field Ambulance. In this capacity he went to London to help with war casualties in need of plastic and reconstructive surgery, notably during the Battle of Britain. Here, Penn trained in military plastic surgery under Sir Harold Gillies and Sir Archibald McIndoe.Bloch, Ceeil and Fana Malherbe 1997. Jack Penn. South African Medical Journal, 78(6):871 Returning to South Africa, he founded and was commander in charge of the Brenthurst Military Hospital, which he founded. Severely damaged by fire in 1944, Brenthurst was restored and returned to its owner, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer made possible a new Chair of Plastic, Maxillo Facial and Oral Surgery, and Dr Penn, at the age of 35, was appointed first professor of Plastic Surgery at the University of the Witwatersrand. His academic positions included visiting professorships at Oxford, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Ann Arbor, UCLA, New York, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hiroshima, Tokyo, and the Taiwan Army Medical Centre. Brenthurst Clinic Penn resigned from the University in 1950 in order to found his own clinic, which he named the Brenthurst Clinic. Penn originated innovative techniques in plastic surgery, notably the Brenthurst Splint, which was standard for many years for jaw fractures. In 1956 Penn was the moving force behind the establishment of the Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and he was elected unanimously as its first president. He helped to initiate plastic and reconstructive surgery in other countries, including Israel (during the 1948 war), Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), Kenya, Gabon (then French Equatorial Africa, at the invitation of Albert Schweitzer at Lambarene), Japan (assisting Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims) and Taiwan.Eberhard, Etaine. 1983.

South African Medical Journal, 78(6):871 Penn was also responsible for the first academic journal of plastic surgery in the English language, the Brenthurst Papers, and he authored many professional papers, editorials and book chapters in this field. Author and sculptor It has been said that Penn was as well known for his sculpture and his writings as for his plastic surgery. Penn's sculptures are to be seen in various places in South Africa and elsewhere. A bust of General Jan Christiaan Smuts was commissioned for the Jan Smuts Airport (now O. R. Tambo Airport), and a statue of Henrietta Stockdale, the nursing pioneer, is in the grounds of St Cyprian's Cathedral in Kimberley. His bust of Albert Schweitzer was presented to Strasbourg, while those of David Ben-Gurion and General Moshe Dayan are in Israel. He produced a bust of Joseph Lister, in England. He also made sketches and paintings. Jack Penn wrote a number of books, mainly of a philosophical nature, which include his Letters to my Son (1975) ‚Äì letters that were addressed to his son John who, like himself, became a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and served as president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery; The Right to Look Human: an autobiography (1976); Reflections on Life (1980); and To think is to live (nd).

Its source is in the Circo de Pineta, in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, in the Aragonese Pyrenees. It is a tributary to the Segre River, with its confluence at La Granja d'Escarp, not far from the point where the Segre flows into the Ebro River. The Cinca River flows through a rich agricultural region.  Path and tributaries  Map of the course of the Cinca The Cinca is born in the area of Pineta and begins its descent between cascades and torrents, in the mountains of the Tres Sorores. It flows across the entire Pineta valley. In Bielsa it joins with the Barrosa, and somewhat later the Cinqueta. Upon reaching A√≠nsa it is joined on the right side by the Ara River, where the Mediano Reservoir is located. Immediately after the Mediano, after crossing the throat of the Entrem√≥n, it is again dammed at the El Grado Reservoir near El Grado. Just after this, it is joined on the left side by the √âsera River, the Cinca's most important tributary. On the right side it is joined by the Vero River, and in Monz√≥n by the Sosa River on the left. Later, the Alcanadre pours into it on the right. Finally, in Massalcoreig, it joins the Segre to flow into the Ebro River.  History  The presence of humans is not found in the upper stretches of the river, but only in the middle stretches, although it is known from ancient accounts. The migratory villages, in the first Iron Age, used the Cinca Valley in their path to the interior; they were populated by the Ilergetes. The current name of the river comes from Cinga, because Julius Caesar in his account of the civil war used that name. It underwent a change of name under the Moors because it came to have the name Az-Zaytum, which meant the River of Olives.

The Great Gale of 1891 destroyed the fishing fleets of many of the smaller Cornish villages. The old boats were generally clinker-planked and lug-rigged. The new boats built after the Gale with government intervention and support were to a new design, carvel planked and with the \\"modern\\" gaff rig, boats we now know as typically West Country with straight stem and transom sterns though the lines varied from port to port. Peter and Anne Pye, in Honolulu in July 1953 Polperro fleet The little fishing port of Polperro, 5 miles west of Looe had a fleet of small sailing fishing boats known as Polperro Gaffers. Their principal catch was the pilchard but this was a late summer catch and the rest of the year they set long lines, and seine nets. Most were built in Looe, around 26' with a deep 6' draft, a gaff rig on a pole mast stepped on the keel and they dried out on legs in Polperro's drying harbour. Similar vessels The Plymouth Hooker was very similar and the only surviving sailing fishing boats still working, the Falmouth Oyster Boats are almost the same in hull design. Design A gaffer in Channals Creek The Polperro Gaffer and the Plymouth Hooker were essentially open boats with a fore deck back to the mast, a small aft deck and narrow side decks or waterways. The \\"cock-pit\\" was divided into the fish hold where the catch was carried and the net hold where the long seine nets were carried with a wooden roller athwartships to feed the net in and out. It was not uncommon for the boats to have a couple of berths in the fore peak cabin. Sails The rig was deliberately low as it had to be handled by a small crew in all weathers and they would lie to the nets with mainsail set. However the sail area could be extended by setting a large topsail on a yard making these boats remarkably fast in races on high days and holidays. Moonraker These boats have excellent sea-keeping capability as witnessed by Dr Peter Pye who with his wife sailed his Polperro Gaffer Moonraker round the world in the 1940s.

It had two masts, and was 47.78 metres long and 6.10 metres wide. Rumija was purchased in England by the Ottoman Turks and carried the name Zaza. In January 1905, Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II gifted the yacht to Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro. The yacht, sailing under Turkish sailors, arrived at Pristan on 1 January 1905 to be taken over by the Montenegrin crew two days later, on 3 January. Two days later, loaded with 15 tonnes of coal, the prince's new yacht set sail for the Bay of Kotor and it cast anchor in Meljine. During the first few months, Zaza was used to transport the royal family from the Bay to Albania. On 23 March 1905, Prince Nicholas, while on board Zaza, held a ceremony which formally commenced the construction of the Port of Bar. Montenegrin Crown Prince Daniel, while taking a cruise down the Bojana River on 28 July 1908, had decided to rename Zaza Rumija. The name Rumija may have been chosen in part because the Rumija mountain range is located near the Bojana River.  World War I and demise  Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat Streiter During World War I, the ship was used to transport military forces and arms. Because of the few risks involved, the Austro- Hungarian forces decided to take action into their own hands, following the ship in pursuit for several days with airplanes, submarines and torpedo boats. Finally, on 2 March 1915, near Pristan, two out of five Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats broke off the ship's anchor chain, pulling the ship to breakwater. This in turn was followed by a series of torpedoes directed toward the ship. The ship is reported to have sunk at 3:45 that morning.  Crew  The yacht's crew included fourteen men operating the ship.

They were proposed by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, following stagnating negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians from 19 to 23 December 2000. The Parameters were the compromises that Clinton believed to be the best possible within the margins of the positions of the two parties. The Clinton Parameters were meant to be the basis for further negotiations. The proposal was presented on 23 December. On 28 December, the Israeli Government formally accepted the plan with reservations. In a meeting in the White House, on 2 January 2001, Yasser Arafat also officially accepted the parameters with reservations. The White House confirmed this the following day in a statement which said that \\"both sides have now accepted the president's ideas with some reservations.\\" In 2005, Clinton wrote that he considered the Israeli reservations within the Parameters and the Palestinians' outside them. Others argue that Clinton's parameters denied Palestinians what they were legally entitled to under international law, specifically, sovereignty over the entirety of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees' right of return to Israeli territory they inhabited before 1948 and dismemberment of Israeli settlements on Palestinian West Bank territory.  Background  The background for the Clinton's Parameters was the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, the following outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada), the upcoming Israeli elections, which polls indicated a possible defeat for then Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and the end of the Clinton presidency, in which Bill Clinton desired to end the eight years of peace efforts and Middle East arena in a successful note. The negotiations, which were suspended on 25 July 2000, were resumed on 19 December at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington. On 21 December, President Clinton presented a plan for a final-status agreement on the basis of former talks. As the parties failed to reach an agreement, Clinton offered bridging proposals, later dubbed \\"the Clinton Parameters\\".UN Division for Palestinian Rights, \\"Monthly media monitoring review,\\" December 2000 . Par. 25‚Äì29. The proposal was drawn up by Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian envoy Dennis Ross, but represented discussions in September between Ross and the other members of his team‚ÄîAaron David Miller, Gamal Helal, Jon Schwartz, and Robert Malley. President Clinton was not consulted in creating the proposal.  The Parameters  The (non-negotiable) Clinton Parameters, to accept within four days as a condition for Clinton's proceeded support,JewishVirtualLibrary, Bill Clinton Reflects on 2000 Camp David Summit. Quotes from President Bill Clinton's autobiography, My Life (2005) were orally presented on 23 December 2000.The unofficial text of the Parameters: 1. ProCon, The Clinton Parameters; 2.

Some sources do not mention the three-year withdrawal period, contrary to Clinton's book My Life. Clinton proposed: A Palestinian state, including 94‚Äì96% of the West Bank; Israeli annexation of settlements in blocks,Note: The sources refer to them as blocks; usually they are called blocs. Settlement blocs are groups of Israeli settlements, exclusive Jewish interconnecting roads and roads connecting them with Israel, together with expropiated and requisitioned land between. with 80% of the current settler population; in East Jerusalem, Arab areas for the Palestinians and Jewish ones for the Israeli; temporary international and Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley and the long-term presence of 3 Israeli- controlled \\"early warning stations\\"; Palestinian sovereignty over its own airspace; return of refugees only to the Palestinian state, in principle. The Parameters did not mention Gaza at all, but Clinton declared on 7 January 2001, that the Palestinian state would include the Gaza Strip.President Clinton's \\"parameters\\" for a comprehensive agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, 7 January 2001. On unispal The proposed percentage of the West Bank the Palestinians would get, however, was ambiguous, as the Israelis did not include the annexed areas in East Jerusalem, the no-man's land and the Palestinian part of the Dead Sea.PLO-NAD, 1 January 2001, Official Palestinian Response to The Clinton Parameters (and letter to the international community) This would decrease the Israeli offer some 5%. = The details = ;Territory The Clinton Parameters proposed a Palestinian state comprising between 94‚Äì96% of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip. Israel would annex the remaining land, which would include Israeli settlements, containing 80% of the settler population, mainly in major settlement blocs. Israel would cede 1‚Äì3% of land to the Palestinians in land swaps to compensate for the annexations. The Palestinian state would have to be contiguous, and annexed areas along with the number of Palestinians affected would be as minimized as possible. ;Jerusalem According to the Parameters, Israel would gain sovereignty over the Western Wall. The Palestinians would gain sovereignty and Israel would gain \\"symbolic ownership\\" over the rest of the Temple Mount, with both parties sharing sovereignty over the issue of excavations under the Temple Mount. East Jerusalem and its Old City would be divided according to ethnic lines, with Israel gaining sovereignty over Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians gaining sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods. ;Refugees The Parameters required the Palestinians to waive their claim to an unlimited \\"right of return\\" to Israel proper, and Israel to acknowledge the \\"moral and material suffering caused to the Palestinian people by the 1948 war, and the need to assist the international community in addressing the problem\\". Under the Parameters, an international commission would be established to implement all aspects dealing with refugees as part of a permanent peace agreement. The Palestinian state would accept all refugees wishing to settle in its territory. The remaining refugees would be rehabilitated in their host countries, immigrate to third- party countries, and a limited number could settle in Israel if it agreed to accept them. Both sides would agree that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 has been implemented. ;Security The Israel Defense Forces would withdraw within 36 months and gradually be replaced by an international force. Israel would retain a small military presence in fixed locations in the Jordan Valley under the authority of the international force for another 36 months. This period could be reduced in the event of the diminishing of regional threats to Israel. Israel would also maintain three radar facilities in the West Bank (Early Warning Stations, EWS). These facilities would have a Palestinian liaison and would be subject to review after every ten years, with any changes in their status to be mutually agreed by both parties. The Palestinian state would gain sovereignty over its own airspace, with special reservations for Israeli training and operational needs. The Palestinian state would also be defined as a \\"non-militarized state\\", and would not possess conventional military forces, but would be allowed to have a \\"strong security force\\". The Palestinian state would also have an international force for border security and deterrence. In the event of a military threat to Israel's national security requiring a state of emergency, Israel would be allowed to deploy military forces to certain areas and routes, according to a pre-drawn map. International forces would have to be notified prior to any such deployments. ;End of the Conflict The Parameters required that this agreement put an end to the conflict and any other claims. This could be implemented through a United Nations Security Council Resolution declaring that Resolutions 242 and 338 have been implemented. Acceptance and reservations On 3 January 2001, the White House released an official statement which stated that both sides had accepted the President's parameters with reservations.Embassy of the United States, Israel, 3 January 2001, Excerpts: State Dept. spokesman on Mideast peace prospects (Both sides accept Clinton's parameters with reservations) .

Moreover, the Israelis demanded a route between East Jerusalem and the Jordan River (to pass by a tunnel or bridge, providing \\"contiguous\\" territoryCamp David and After: An Exchange (1.

There were also fears that the Parameters would not be approved in a public referendum, and that the Palestinians might violate their terms of the agreements. Despite some provisions on Jerusalem being contrary to the election promises of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the Parameters received wide support in the Israeli cabinet, which voted early on 28 December with 10 votes to 2 to accept them, but with reservations and on condition the Palestinians would accept them as well. Only Cabinet Minister Roni Milo resigned over his objection to the Cabinet's approval of the plan.CNN, 27 December 2000, \\"Mideast summit in Egypt called off\\" On 31 December, Barak declared that Israel had accepted Clinton's proposals, but will not accept the Palestinian right of return to Israel and sovereignty over the Temple Mount.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 31 December 2000, PM Barak: Israel has proven its commitment to peace Although he chose to accept the plan, Barak sent Clinton a 20-page letter of \\"reservations\\".

Ross diligently spread this fairy tale, as did the president himself.\\" A summit with Arafat and Barak the next day in Egypt was cancelled.RT√â, 28 December 2000, \\"Arafat and Mubarak hold 'constructive' talks on peace proposals\\"CNN, 27 December 2000, \\"Palestinians ask for more details on U.S. peace proposals\\" On 1 January, the Palestinian Negotiating Team (NAD) published an open letter, explaining why the proposals would \\"fail to satisfy the conditions required for a permanent peace\\". They claimed that the parameters divided the Palestinian state, including East Jerusalem, into separate cantons and unconnected islands, and protested the surrender the right of return of Palestinian refugees and lack of clarity and details. Clinton's proposal was not accompanied by a map; only the Israelis presented a map, which would allegedly render the Palestinian state unviable and lacking direct access to international borders. The Palestinians opposed the Israeli annexation of settlement blocs in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which they claimed subordinated the contiguity of the Palestinian state. They also protested that Israel would gain control over their natural resources, and was planning on ceding them less valuable land on the outskirts of West Bank and Gaza in exchange. While Arafat flew to Washington to meet with President Clinton, the newspaper Al-Ayyam published in Arabic a letter to Clinton with the Palestinian reservations.An English translation of the letter, which reflects the open NAD letter: MEMRI: Arafat's Letter of Reservations to President Clinton, IMRA, 11 January 2001; Also on MEMRI On 2 January 2001, at a meeting in the White House, Arafat gave his qualified agreement to the Parameters with reservations. In a memorandum, his Negotiations Support Unit (NSU) had warned him \\"that the proposals in general are too vague and unclear to form an acceptable framework for an agreement\\".Palestine Papers, 2 January 2001, Memorandum. On The negotiation team opposed the use of percentages. First, the Israelis were to make clear which reasonable needs they had in specific areas; without a map, the percentages given were also ambiguous, as the Israelis did not include all disputed land or part of the Dead Sea, and it was unclear where the 80% proportion of settlers would remain. All Israeli settlers taken together occupied around 1.8% of the West Bank. The Palestinian concerns about lack of contiguity were largely related to Israeli control over large swaths of land in key development areas such as Jerusalem and Bethlehem, due to the large settlement blocs. Palestinians would be unable to move without restriction within their own state. A PLO website gives further comments on the Parameters.PLO-NAD, Summary - Negotiation and the peace process The Palestinian position about the right of return was, as it has always been, that it is an individual universal right which can never be set aside. This right they see acknowledged in UN resolution 194.Palestine Papers, 22 April 2001, NSU: Possible Questions & Answers to Camp David; see par. 16. On Public opinion A 25 December published poll found that 48% of the 501 Israelis questioned were opposed to the proposals; 57% would object to Palestinian control of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound; 72% were against even a limited return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. A 29 December published poll found that 56% of the Israelis would oppose a peace agreement reached on the basis of the Parameters. A poll carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University indicated that a growing number of Palestinians and Israelis supported a settlement to the conflict based on the Parameters. The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47% of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out.  Aftermath  Additional attempts to reach a compromise at the Taba Summit were unsuccessful, although some progress was made. In Israel, the Prime Minister's opponents claimed that his government lacked the support of the Israeli public, the Knesset (Israeli parliament) and the polls, and that he was submitting Israel to a \\"liquidation sale\\".

The hotel is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing property of the Downtown Woodland Historic District. History In 1920 the idea of an upscale hotel in Woodland was discussed by a group of local businessmen, who then formed an investment group that offered stock ownership for this idea. This group approached W.H. Weeks with their preliminary plans after enough funds were raised to make the project seem possible. The plans weren't carried out until 1928, however. At this point in Woodland's history, there were many tourists and visitors to the city, and this prosperity prompted the plans years earlier for an upscale hotel, to come to fruition. The hotel was developed by Weeks' Securities Corporation, a corporation Weeks had just started the same year, which had developed several other hotels in northern California. Around 50 local businesses also invested in the hotel, raising 10% of the $500,000 spent to construct the building. A site on the corner of Main and College Street was chosen, where just ten years earlier a hotel by the name of Byrns Hotel had been condemned and demolished. Hotel Woodland was thus made real. In the 25 years since his first project in Woodland, this would be Weeks' 14th project and last major work in the city. The hotel was completed with four stories, 80 guest rooms, and was built reflecting a simplified California Churrigueresque style of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. The Spanish Colonial Revival style of the building shows a simplified commercial version, but has more detailed Churrigueresque features like the \\"festively painted\\" moldings that are grouped together in the upper window of the central tower of the building. The building also shows off a clay tile roof and decorated spiral columns near the entryway. The building's lobby features of cement floor, meant to appear like Mexican tile, wrought iron chandeliers and \\"beamed, stenciled ceilings\\". The ground floor also had a restaurant and a banquet room for social events. Its elegance made it a spot for important community events and gatherings. Because of its visibility on Main Street, as well as its beauty, it was one of the buildings that contributed to the splendor of Downtown Woodland. By the 1980s, the hotel had become dilapidated and worn. Main Street merchants and city residents all agreed that something had to be done to the building, either to demolish it or to renovate it. After much discussion over several years, the path of renovation for the hotel was chosen. Near the end of 1994 a non-profit organization and a local developer purchased the hotel for $925,000. They made $5.5 million in subsequent renovations to make the hotel livable. The hotel was converted into a place for low-income residents. The renovations were funded from local, state, and federal grants. The upper floors were planned for housing while the bottom floors were projected to have shops.

Patent disputes uncovered earlier designs by Peter Chilvers and Newman Darby such that Drake accepted that he was the third inventor of the concept. He was the engineer who perfected the concepts of board and rig layout and the universal joint which is core to the sport. Aeronautics career Drake trained as an aeronautical engineer, although as most of his work was for the US Government, most of the details remain to this day top secret. What is known is that he worked for Rockwell and their division RAND Corporation, worked for North American Aviation, and was on secondment to The Pentagon for various periods of his career both directly and indirectly, part of which was associated with the development of improved Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles during the Cold War of the 1960s and 70's. Invention of windsurfing Drake, a Californian by birth, loved the water and sailing. In 1964, over a discussion on water sports over a brandy at his home in Southern California, Drake and his former Rockwell boss and now good friend Fred Payne, who worked at The Pentagon, discussed options for creating a wind-powered water-ski which would allow Payne to travel on the Potomac River. That night they developed the idea of a kite powered surfboard. On later reflection, Drake didn't like the integrity of the idea and dismissed it. There were already a number of sailboard designs available, and Drake also was concerned about the integrity of a design needing taut wire close to a human body to keep the sail upright. Still developing the idea, Drake's wife met the pregnant Diana Schweitzer, and the two families became good friends through their children. Drake mentioned the idea to surfer Hoyle Schweitzer who wanted to develop it, but Drake was still unsure of how to control and steer what he envisaged in a design concept as a surfboard with upright sail design, whereby the sailor stood upright on the board holding the sail. The technical problem was that most boats steer by differentiating the angle of attack in the water between the centre board and the rudder, and Drake's question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft. In 1967, while driving between his home and a contract at the Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, Drake had time to reflect on early 17th century based sail ship control. Rudders then were weak and ineffective, mostly used for trimming course. Hence with multi-masted boats, the sailors would trim the upper sails on the forward and rewards masts to steer the ship. Dismissing the idea of a design with two upright sails, Drake decided to move the sail by rotation, as moving it linearly would require a mechanical system. Experimenting with a rotational design which became the concept for the universal joint, whereby the angle of attack of the sail to the board could be varied to allow control of both power and craft direction. Drake finished the design by using an earlier but for them failed invention of East Coast racing sail, and added a wishbone boom. =Drake's first prototype, the Windsurfer name= Drake built a concept in his garage. Hoyle supplied two sails that were adapted to the two options of rigs Drake built, by sail maker Bob Broussard into a triangular Bermuda rig. In May 1967, Drake and both families went to Marina del Rey to try the two universal joint designs. Met by Broussard who happened to be on his bicycle, the first design failed, but the second worked. Drake admits he had thought through many of the ideas of control, but hadn't thought about how he would raise the sail from the water, so on this first run got Broussard to wade into the water to give it to him. Although the design worked, Drake was frustrated by the control mechanism, the need for pulling the sail out of the water, and continually ending up in the water when he lost control: effectively, he was teaching himself to windsurf while creating the prototype. Having remembered to insert a skeg this time, Drake added a lanyard (now called an uphaul) by which he could stand up and haul his own sail out of the water. Returning to Marina del Rey two weeks later, Drake was impressed enough by the improved prototype to allow Hoyle to arrange a launch party for what they had called the \\"Skate.\\" However, they found another company had already used the name \\"Skate\\" and were preparing to copyright it, so decided on the name \\"Baja Board.\\" While developing the design and patent paperwork, in late 1967/early 1968, Hoyle was showing a prototype \\"Baja Board\\" in Seattle, when Public Relations man Bert Salisbury stopped his car to have a look, and commented: \\"Gee I have the perfect name for it! The WINDSURFER!\\" The details of the original designs are available in Drake's white paper on windsurfing, and these interviews with Jim Drake. Despite forty years of subsequent development, the design is still remarkably similar to today's windsurfing equipment, and the word \\"windsurfer\\" has become synonymous with the sport itself. There is also a video of Drake's early attempts to teach himself windsurfing. =Windsurfing International= In 1968, Drake and Hoyle together as individuals filed the very first windsurfing patent, which was granted by the USPTO in 1970.About.com: Inventors - History of Windsurfing There is no evidence that they had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs, but Drake accepts in retrospect that although he can be credited with invention, he was \\"probably no better than third,\\" behind Englishman Peter Chilvers and mid-west based Newman Darby. The patent was wholly licensed by Drake and Hoyle to Windsurfing International. Subsequently in 1968, Hoyle and Diana Schweitzer founded the company Windsurfing International in Southern California to manufacture, promote and license a windsurfer design. The company registered the term \\"windsurfer\\" as a trademark at the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1973, launching the craft as a one-design class. Going one-design was influenced by the success of the Laser and Hobie Cat classes. Each Windsurfer had an identical computer-cut sail, a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce and the Laser class. In 1968, Hoyle's other business collapsed, and he and Diane moved to Newport Beach; at the same time Drake accepted a two year secondment to The Pentagon, and moved to Washington DC. Immediately, Hoyle offered Drake to buy out his half of the patent, and it was only when Hoyle pointed out ownership of the company that the relationship between the pair began to fall apart. Having returned to California, in 1973 Drake sold his half of the patent to Windsurfing International for the sum of $36,000. =Patent disputes= Through the seventies, Schweitzer aggressively promoted and licensed the Windsurfing International design and licensed the patent to manufacturers worldwide. The sport underwent very rapid growth, particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub-license sold to Ten Cate in the Netherlands. At the same time, Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers. This led to a host of pre-dating windsurfer-like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International's rights to the invention. In 1979, Schweitzer licensed Brittany, France-based company Dufour Wing, which was later merged with Tabur Marine - the precursor of Bic Sport. Europe was now the largest growing market for windsurfers, and the sub-licensed companies - Tabur, F2, Mistral - wanted to find a way to remove or reduce their royalty payments to Windsurfing International. Tabur lawyers found prior art, in a local English newspaper which had published a single story with a picture about Peter Chilvers, who as a young boy on Hayling Island on the south coast of England, assembled his first board combined with a sail, in 1958. They also found stories published about the 1964 invention of the Darby Sailboard by Newman Darby in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania. . In Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd. 1985 RPC 59, with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fanatic Baron Marcel Bich, British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer, but rather a \\"straight split boom\\" that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was \\"merely an obvious extension\\". It is worthy of note that this court case set a significant precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom, in terms of inventive step and non-obviousness; the court upheld the defendant's claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International and royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became the world‚Äôs largest producer of windsurfing equipment, with an annual production of 15,000 boards. In 1983, Schweitzer sued Swiss board manufacturer Mistral, which is today still a major sailboard manufacturer, and lost. Mistral's defense hinged on the work of US inventor Newman Darby, who in the mid-sixties conceived the \\"sailboard\\": a hand-held square rigged \\"kite\\" sail on a floating platform for recreational use. Darby's published version did not show any connection between the rig and the board (the mast simply rested in a depression on the board) but it did refer to a \\"more complex swivel step for advanced riders not shown\\". He published his \\"sailboard\\" design in August 1965 Popular Science magazine. Darby organized Darby Industries Inc in 1964 to build these sailboards. However, the sailboard never gained popularity, and Darby's company ceased operations by the end of the 1960s. Eventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Chilvers prior art. Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms, and finally it expired in 1987. Shortly thereafter, having lost its license royalty income, Windsurfing International ceased operations. In 1983, Australian courts reported a patent case in \\"Intellectual Property Reports\\" 3 IPR 449, attributed the first legally accepted use to an Australian boy, Richard Eastaugh. Between the ages of ten and thirteen, from 1946 to 1949, aided by his younger brothers, he built around 20 galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms. He sailed these near his home on the Swan River in Perth. There is no evidence that any of the later \\"inventors\\" ever sighted the Eastaugh craft of a decade earlier on the other side of the world. It is acknowledged that the separate Chilvers, Darby inventions all pre-dated the Drake and Schweitzer patent. Death Drake died on June 19, 2012, from complications of lung disease, at his home in Pfafftown, North Carolina.

The angle between the radii lying within the bounding semidisks is the dihedral angle of the wedge Œ±. If AB is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z-axis, revolving AB only through a given Œ± produces a spherical wedge of the same angle Œ±. Beman (2008) remarks that \\"a spherical wedge is to the sphere of which it is a part as the angle of the wedge is to a perigon.\\" A spherical wedge of Œ± = radians (180¬∞) is called a hemisphere, while a spherical wedge of Œ± = 2 radians (360¬∞) constitutes a complete ball. The volume of a spherical wedge can be intuitively related to the AB definition in that while the volume of a ball of radius r is given by r, the volume a spherical wedge of the same radius r is given by :V = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi} \\\\cdot \\\\tfrac43 \\\\pi r^3 = \\\\tfrac23 \\\\alpha r^3\\\\,. Extrapolating the same principle and considering that the surface area of a sphere is given by 4r, it can be seen that the surface area of the lune corresponding to the same wedge is given by :A = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi} \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi r^2 = 2 \\\\alpha r^2\\\\,. Hart (2009) states that the \\"volume of a spherical wedge is to the volume of the sphere as the number of degrees in the [angle of the wedge] is to 360\\". Hence, and through derivation of the spherical wedge volume formula, it can be concluded that, if Vs is the volume of the sphere and Vw is the volume of a given spherical wedge, :\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{w}}{V_\\\\mathrm{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi}\\\\,. Also, if Sl is the area of a given wedge's lune, and Ss is the area of the wedge's sphere, :\\\\frac{S_\\\\mathrm{l}}{S_\\\\mathrm{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi}\\\\,.

The term ungula refers to the hoof of a horse, an anatomical feature that defines a class of mammals called ungulates. The volume of an ungula of a cylinder was calculated by Gr√©goire de Saint Vincent.Gregory of St. Vincent (1647) Opus Geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni Two cylinders with equal radii and perpendicular axes intersect in four double ungulae.Blaise Pascal Lettre de Dettonville a Carcavi describes the onglet and double onglet, link from HathiTrust The bicylinder formed by the intersection had been measured by Archimedes in The Method of Mechanical Theorems, but the manuscript was lost until 1906. A historian of calculus described the role of the ungula in integral calculus: :Gr√©goire himself was primarily concerned to illustrate by reference to the ungula that volumetric integration could be reduced, through the ductus in planum, to a consideration of geometric relations between the lies of plane figures. The ungula, however, proved a valuable source of inspiration for those who followed him, and who saw in it a means of representing and transforming integrals in many ingenious ways.Margaret E. Baron (1969) The Origins of the Infinitesimal Calculus, Pergamon Press, republished 2014 by Elsevier, Google Books preview Cylindrical ungula Ungula of a right circular cylinder. A cylindrical ungula of base radius r and height h has volume : V = {2\\\\over 3} r^2 h,Solids - Volumes and Surfaces at The Engineering Toolbox. Its total surface area is : A = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r^2 + {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} + 2 r h, the surface area of its curved sidewall is : A_s = 2 r h , and the surface area of its top (slanted roof) is : A_t = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} . =Proof= Consider a cylinder x^2 + y^2 = r^2 bounded below by plane z = 0 and above by plane z = k y where k is the slope of the slanted roof: : k = {h \\\\over r}. Cutting up the volume into slices parallel to the y-axis, then a differential slice, shaped like a triangular prism, has volume : A(x) \\\\, dx where : A(x) = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \\\\cdot k \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2} = {1\\\\over 2} k (r^2 - x^2) is the area of a right triangle whose vertices are, (x, 0, 0), (x, \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}, 0) , and (x, \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}, k \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}), and whose base and height are thereby \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2} and k \\\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}, respectively. Then the volume of the whole cylindrical ungula is : V = \\\\int_{-r}^r A(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\int_{-r}^r {1\\\\over 2} k (r^2 - x^2) \\\\, dx : \\\\qquad = {1\\\\over 2} k \\\\Big([r^2 x]_{-r}^r - \\\\Big[{1\\\\over 3} x^3\\\\Big]_{-r}^r \\\\Big) = {1\\\\over 2} k (2 r^3 - {2\\\\over 3} r^3) = {2 \\\\over 3} k r^3 which equals : V = {2\\\\over 3} r^2 h after substituting r k = h. A differential surface area of the curved side wall is : dA_s = k r (\\\\sin \\\\theta) \\\\cdot r \\\\, d\\\\theta = k r^2 (\\\\sin \\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta , which area belongs to a nearly flat rectangle bounded by vertices (r \\\\cos \\\\theta, r \\\\sin \\\\theta, 0), (r \\\\cos \\\\theta, r \\\\sin \\\\theta, k r \\\\sin \\\\theta), (r \\\\cos (\\\\theta + d\\\\theta), r \\\\sin (\\\\theta + d\\\\theta), 0), and (r \\\\cos (\\\\theta + d\\\\theta), r \\\\sin (\\\\theta + d\\\\theta), k r \\\\sin (\\\\theta + d\\\\theta)), and whose width and height are thereby r \\\\, d\\\\theta and (close enough to) k r \\\\sin \\\\theta, respectively. Then the surface area of the wall is : A_s = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi dA_s = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi k r^2 (\\\\sin \\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta = k r^2 \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta where the integral yields -[\\\\cos \\\\theta]_0^\\\\pi = -[-1 - 1] = 2 , so that the area of the wall is : A_s = 2 k r^2 , and substituting r k = h yields : A_s = 2 r h. The base of the cylindrical ungula has the surface area of half a circle of radius r: {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r^2 , and the slanted top of the said ungula is a half-ellipse with semi-minor axis of length r and semi-major axis of length r \\\\sqrt{1 + k^2}, so that its area is : A_t = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\cdot r \\\\sqrt{1 + k^2} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + (k r)^2} and substituting k r = h yields : A_t = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}. ‚àé Note how the surface area of the side wall is related to the volume: such surface area being 2kr^2, multiplying it by dr gives the volume of a differential half-shell, whose integral is {2\\\\over 3} k r^3, the volume. When the slope k equals 1 then such ungula is precisely one eighth of a bicylinder, whose volume is {16\\\\over 3} r^3. One eighth of this is {2\\\\over 3} r^3. Conical ungula Ungula of a right circular cone. A conical ungula of height h, base radius r, and upper flat surface slope k (if the semicircular base is at the bottom, on the plane z = 0) has volume : V = {r^3 k H I \\\\over 6} where : H = {1 \\\\over {1\\\\over h} - {1\\\\over r k}} is the height of the cone from which the ungula has been cut out, and : I = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi {2 H + k r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\over (H + k r \\\\sin \\\\theta)^2} \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta . The surface area of the curved sidewall is : A_s = {k r^2 \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} \\\\over 2} I . As a consistency check, consider what happens when the height of the cone goes to infinity, so that the cone becomes a cylinder in the limit: :\\\\lim_{H\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\Big(I - {4\\\\over H}\\\\Big) = \\\\lim_{H\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\Big({2 H \\\\over H^2} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta - {4\\\\over H} \\\\Big) = 0 so that :\\\\lim_{H\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} V = {r^3 k H \\\\over 6} \\\\cdot {4\\\\over H} = {2\\\\over 3} k r^3 , :\\\\lim_{H\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_s = {k r^2 H \\\\over 2} \\\\cdot {4\\\\over H} = 2 k r^2 , and : \\\\lim_{H\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_t = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r^2 {\\\\sqrt{1 + k^2} \\\\over 1 + 0} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r^2 \\\\sqrt{1 + k^2} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + (r k)^2}, which results agree with the cylindrical case. =Proof= Let a cone be described by : 1 - {\\\\rho \\\\over r} = {z \\\\over H} where r and H are constants and z and œÅ are variables, with : \\\\rho = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\\\qquad 0 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le r and : x = \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\qquad y = \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta . Let the cone be cut by a plane : z = k y = k \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta. Substituting this z into the cone's equation, and solving for œÅ yields : \\\\rho_0 = {1 \\\\over {1\\\\over r} + {k \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\over H}} which for a given value of Œ∏ is the radial coordinate of the point common to both the plane and the cone that is farthest from the cone's axis along an angle Œ∏ from the x-axis. The cylindrical height coordinate of this point is : z_0 = H \\\\Big(1 - {\\\\rho_0 \\\\over r}\\\\Big) . So along the direction of angle Œ∏, a cross- section of the conical ungula looks like the triangle : (0,0,0) - (\\\\rho_0 \\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\rho_0 \\\\sin \\\\theta, z_0) - (r \\\\cos \\\\theta, r \\\\sin \\\\theta, 0) . Rotating this triangle by an angle d\\\\theta about the z-axis yields another triangle with \\\\theta + d\\\\theta, \\\\rho_1, z_1 substituted for \\\\theta, \\\\rho_0, and z_0 respectively, where \\\\rho_1 and z_1 are functions of \\\\theta + d\\\\theta instead of \\\\theta. Since d\\\\theta is infinitesimal then \\\\rho_1 and z_1 also vary infinitesimally from \\\\rho_0 and z_0, so for purposes of considering the volume of the differential trapezoidal pyramid, they may be considered equal. The differential trapezoidal pyramid has a trapezoidal base with a length at the base (of the cone) of r d\\\\theta, a length at the top of \\\\Big({H - z_0 \\\\over H}\\\\Big) r d\\\\theta, and altitude {z_0 \\\\over H} \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2}, so the trapezoid has area :A_T = {r\\\\,d\\\\theta + \\\\Big({H - z_0 \\\\over H}\\\\Big) r\\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\over 2} {z_0 \\\\over H} \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} = r\\\\,d\\\\theta {(2 H - z_0) z_0 \\\\over 2 H^2} \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2}. An altitude from the trapezoidal base to the point (0,0,0) has length differentially close to :{r H \\\\over \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2}}. (This is an altitude of one of the side triangles of the trapezoidal pyramid.) The volume of the pyramid is one-third its base area times its altitudinal length, so the volume of the conical ungula is the integral of that: : V = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi {1\\\\over 3} {r H\\\\over \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2}} {(2 H - z_0) z_0 \\\\over 2 H^2} \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} r\\\\,d\\\\theta = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi {1\\\\over 3} r^2 {(2 H - z_0) z_0 \\\\over 2 H} d\\\\theta = {r^2 k \\\\over 6 H} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi (2 H - k y_0) y_0 \\\\,d\\\\theta where : y_0 = \\\\rho_0 \\\\sin \\\\theta = {\\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\over {1\\\\over r} + {k \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\over H}} = {1 \\\\over {1\\\\over r \\\\sin \\\\theta} + {k\\\\over H}} Substituting the right hand side into the integral and doing some algebraic manipulation yields the formula for volume to be proven. For the sidewall: :A_s = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi A_T = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi {(2 H - z_0) z_0 \\\\over 2 H^2} r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2}\\\\,d\\\\theta = {k r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} \\\\over 2 H^2} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi (2 H - z_0) y_0 \\\\,d\\\\theta and the integral on the rightmost-hand-side simplifies to H^2 r I. ‚àé As a consistency check, consider what happens when k goes to infinity; then the conical ungula should become a semi-cone. : \\\\lim_{k\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\Big(I - {\\\\pi \\\\over k r}\\\\Big) = 0 : \\\\lim_{k\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} V = {r^3 k H \\\\over 6} \\\\cdot {\\\\pi \\\\over k r} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\Big({1\\\\over 3} \\\\pi r^2 H\\\\Big) which is half of the volume of a cone. : \\\\lim_{k\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_s = {k r^2 \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} \\\\over 2} \\\\cdot {\\\\pi \\\\over k r} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\pi r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} which is half of the surface area of the curved wall of a cone. =Surface area of top part= When k = H / r , the \\"top part\\" (i.e., the flat face that is not semicircular like the base) has a parabolic shape and its surface area is : A_t = {2\\\\over 3} r \\\\sqrt{r^2 + H^2} .

During the Great Depression and Prohibition, the owner was allegedly a bootlegger. The resort attracted celebrities such as Cecil B. DeMille and Rudolph Valentino, who \\"came up here and laid in the hot water baths, and they drank the whiskey\\". In the 1940s and 1950s, it was home to a gas station. The Rock Store opened in 1961 as a grocery store, later becoming a common motorcycle pit stop.

The foundations, located west of the active San Andreas Fault, were being dug at the time the plant was cancelled. The action has been termed \\"the birth of the anti-nuclear movement.\\" History Pacific Gas & Electric planned to build the first commercially viable nuclear power plant in the US at Bodega Bay, California, a fishing village fifty miles north of San Francisco. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958.Paula Garb. Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958‚Äì1978 (book review) Journal of Political Ecology, Vol 6, 1999, Retrieved 14 December 2015 The proposed plant site is close to the San Andreas Fault, a major active tectonic boundary, and in the region's environmentally sensitive fishing and dairy industries. Bodega Head sits on the Pacific Plate, while the town is on the North American Plate. Fishermen feared that the \\"plant's location and thermal discharge would interfere with their livelihood.\\" Other citizens did not want their \\"simple isolated lifestyle\\" disturbed. Bodega Bay resident Rose Gaffney, who owned acreage on the Bodega Head that PG&E; needed to buy, sued the utility company to keep her land and invited government officials to see the fault lines on the proposed nuclear site. The Sierra Club became actively involved and opposed the choice of the site. The Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, said he was \\"gravely concerned\\" about the Bodega site.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, pp. 110‚Äì111. The Northern California Association to Preserve Bodega Head (NCAPBH) was formed and released press statements and submitted appeals to various state and federal bodies. In June 1963, NCAPBH organized a public meeting and 1,500 helium balloons were released into the air. They carried the message: \\"This balloon could represent a radioactive molecule of strontium 90 or iodine 131.\\" These two substances had reached public prominence in the debate about fallout from nuclear weapons testing.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 94. The conflict ended in 1964, when, following a negative review by the Atomic Energy Commission, Pacific Gas & Electric withdrew its application and canceled plans for the plant. By this point, a pit had been dug for the foundation, near the tip of Bodega Head; since the abandonment of the site, the pit has partially filled with water and become a pond, informally called the \\"Hole in the Head.\\" Thomas Wellock traces the birth of the anti-nuclear movement to the controversy over Bodega Bay. An attempt by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to build a nuclear power plant in Corral Canyon near Malibu, similar to that at Bodega Bay, was abandoned in 1970.

Sadashivgad is a village located in Karwar, Uttara Kannada district, in the state of Karnataka in India. Significant and picturesque, it is now a popular tourist destination located by the Kali river bridge, which has been built at the confluence of the river and the Arabian Sea. Geography & Structure The fort was built on an old fortified site on the north bank of Kali River where it meets the sea. It had about 8 meters high ramparts which were about 2 metres wide at the top. There were towers and openings for guns. The citadel was at the highest point. An outwork was on the west, near the sea at the base of the cliff and was appropriately called Pani Killa. There was another outwork on the eastern slope. The citadel had single arched gateway. Samvargad was a very small fort, about 60 metres by 20 metres on top of a hillock east of Sadashivgad. It was a satellite fort guarding the former on its east & north east. Very few ruins remain. History Kali River Bridge view from Nandangadda village. =Etymology= The fort was named Sadashivgad by Basavlingraj after his father Sadashivlingraj in 1715. They were chieftains of Sonda who assumed the title of 'Raja' after incorporating Chittakula, Simveshwar (Angadi), Kadra, Kadwad, Ankola and some other parts of Canara. The old Karwar fort was pulled down and its material used to build Sadashivgad. =Early history= Cintacora as known to the Portuguese was a very old port and was also known as Chitrakul(Chittakula) and Sindpur. When Sadashivgad was built in this area, the village also came to be known by that name. A fort existed at Cintacora which was captured and burnt by the Portuguese in 1510. They called it Pir fort due to the Muslim Dargah(Tomb of a Sufi Saint Shahkaramuddin) they found there - & was known in Portuguese language as Forte de Piro or Pito. The creek at the mouth of the Kali River was a trading center from early days. It came into greater prominence after Sadashivgad was built and the Portuguese realized the advantages of its sheltered harbor. =Early Trade= In 1638 a rival English trading body, the Courteen Association, established a factory at Karwar. Muslin was the chief commodity purchased but Karwar was also a source for pepper, cardamom, cassier and coarse blue cotton cloth. Situated on India's west coast, 50 miles south- east of Goa, Karwar was noted for its safe harbour. In 1649 the Courteen Association united with the Company and Karwar became a Company factory. =Maratha Influence= Having marched from Bednore in the south, visiting on his way the sacred temple at Gokarna, Shivaji] seized Ankola and the next day came to Karwar (then known as Kadwad). Both the East India Company and Sher Shah, the sardar of Bijapur, were very much alarmed at this sudden development. They collected huge amount and offering it to Shivaji, prayed that they may be spared. Satisfied at the recognition of his authority, Shivaji crossed the Kali River and conquered Sadashivgad on 21 February 1665; =Portuguese & East India Company Rule= Owing to the hostility of the Raja of Sonda, the factory was closed in 1720 and was not reopened until 1750. War broke out in the meanwhile between the Portuguese and the Raja of Sonda. The Raja of Sonda had helped the English establish a factory in Karwar. This was not liked by the Portuguese. In May 1752 the Portuguese sent a fleet and captured the Sonda fort, Sadashivgad but was given back on restoration of peace when the Portuguese were allowed to build a fort at Bhatkal. The Portuguese claimed the monopoly of the Karwar trade and as they were in a position to enforce their claim, the English agent was withdrawn. It passed on to Tipu Sultan in 1793 and finally to the East India Company in 1799 after the Battle of Seringapatam in which Tipu died. *In the Treaty of Mangalore(1784) one finds reference of Karwar & Sadashivgad written as Carwar and Sadasewgude. *Karwar since the records of 1862, the time from which it fell under Bombay Presidency, was described as the first rate harbor between Bombay & Colombo. Current Condition The fort is in ruins as most of it was pulled down by East India Company General Matthews in 1783. A road now runs between it and its satellite fort Samvargad. Midway on the Sadashivagad hill is the many centuries old Shantadurga Temple, known for its serenity. From the peak of the hill, the view of the sun setting in the Arabian sea, is an experience in itself. The 17th century Dargah also attracts a lot of Muslim pilgrims. At a distance of approximately 2 km northwards a village lies by name Shiveshvar which got Fortress Kot Shiveshvar (mentioned in the Mangalore treaty between Tipu Sultan and the East India Company, as well as in earlier historical accounts) built exclusively for guarding the northern borders of Canara. It was built by the Bijapur Sultanate and subsequently, its fortunes were connected to the Sadashivgad Fort. This fort is in a shambles but the eastern gate, a Muslim graveyard, well and tunnel can still be seen. Another important village is Kadwad situated on the banks of tributary of the Kali River, from which the name 'Karwar' has been derived. At this location the British used to have a factory and it was an important trade port in earlier days. It also had a large Muslim population and a larger mosque which was frequented by traders from Arabia and Africa. The National Highway NH-66 continues on a bridge built over Kali River and the road splits the Sadashivgad granite hill to connect Karnataka to Goa. Reaching Sadashivgad =By Train= The closest railway stations are Karwar and Asnoti; though transport facilities are better available at the larger station of Karwar. =By Road= Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses as well as Goa state owned Kadamba Transport Corporation buses ply regularly on the NH-66. Apart from State transport, a number of private operators run their bus services on the same route. Trivia * Sadashivgad used to be a popular word for native konkani speaking people travelling from Mumbai to Karwar before the advent of Konkan Railway. In local Konkani people, it is mostly referred to as simply 'Gad'. * Jayshree Gadkar a noted Marathi movie actress and a star of Marathi cinema in the 1960s was born in a konkani speaking family at Kanasgiri village very close to Sadashivgad.

She is a distant relative, on her mother's side, of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Her family, the Parkers, were reported to be relatives of Mary Todd Lincoln.Wild Ride, Anne Hagedorn Auerbach, New York, Henry Holt & Company, 1994. p.61 In 1919 she married Warren Wright Sr. (1875-1950); their son Warren Jr. (died 1978) was born in 1920 and married and had four children. Thoroughbred racing She inherited Calumet Farm on the death of her husband and ran it successfully for more than thirty years. Under her guidance, Calumet Farm won the Kentucky Derby four times beginning with Hill Gail (1952), Iron Liege (1957), Tim Tam (1958), and Forward Pass (1968). Among her other horses, in 1977 her filly Our Mims (named after her second husband's daughter, Melinda) won the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, in 1979 another filly, Davona Dale won the Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing (as well as finishing Fourth in the 1979 Travers Stakes against colts), and in 1981 still another filly, Before Dawn was voted the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Two- Year-Old Filly. On September 27, 1952, Lucille Wright married screenwriter Admiral Gene Markey. With her new husband, she divided her time between Lexington, Kentucky, Miami Beach and Saratoga Springs. She owned a Yorkshire Terrier, Timmy Tammy, and carried the dog with her in her purse everywhere she went - even on airplanes. It has been speculated that Calumet's outstanding thoroughbred Tim Tam was named after the dog, but this has never been absolutely proven. Among her hobbies were needlepoint and collecting statues of eagles. In 18th century Kentucky, eagles were widely believed to be a symbol of good luck.Wild Ride, Anne Hagedorn Auerbach, New York, Henry Holt & Company, 1994. p.62 In 1978, when Calumet Farm's outstanding three-year-old colt Alydar (named for Prince Aly Khan, and half-brother of Our Mims), ran in the Bluegrass States at Keeneland the Markeys (due to their failing health) were brought to the rail to watch him run. Alydar won in a time of 1:49.60. Admiral Markey died in 1980. Death and legacy She established the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust. The Trust's aims were to benefit basic medical research. The University of Virginia's Molecular Biology Institute is among the many recipients of grants from the Trust. Lucille Markey died on July 24, 1982 at the age of 85 in the Miami Heart Institute in Miami, Florida. She is buried next to her second husband, Admiral Gene Markey, in Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky. As Warren Wright Jr., her only son and heir, predeceased her in 1978, his widow Bertha Cochran Wright and their four children (two sons and two daughters) inherited Calumet Farm, only to lose it under scandalous circumstances ten years later. Calumet Farm is now part of an investment trust company.

It is dedicated to the Apostle Saint Andrew whose relics are kept here. Formerly the archiepiscopal seat of the Diocese of Amalfi, it has been since 1986 that of the Diocese of Amalfi-Cava de' Tirreni. Begun in the 9th and 10th centuries, it has been added to and redecorated several times, overlaying Arab-Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque elements, and finally a new 19th century Norman-Arab-Byzantine facade. The cathedral includes the adjoining 9th-century Basilica of the Crucifix. Leading from the basilica are steps into the Crypt of St. Andrew. History The first church, now the Diocesan Museum of Amalfi was built on the 9th century on the ruins of a previous temple. A second church was built to the south in 10th century, and this is now the Cathedral. By the 12th century the two churches formed a single 6 aisle Romanesque church, which was reduced to 5 in the 13th century to allow the construction of the cloister of Paradise, in the Arab-Norman style. The remains of St. Andrew were reportedly brought to Amalfi from Constantinople in 1206 during the Fourth Crusade by Cardinal Peter of Capua. In 1208, the crypt was completed and the relics were turned over to the church. It said that later on manna issued from the saint's bones. The bell tower was constructed between the 12th and 13th centuries in front of the first church, topped by an elaborate crown decorated with marble and majolica in the Arab-Norman style, also seen in other churches in southern Italy in this period. The chapels inside are variously Gothic and Renaissance, with the nave decorated in the Baroque style in the 18th century. In 1861, part of the facade collapsed, damaging the atrium. The whole front of the church was then rebuilt to a design by architect Errico Alvino in a richly decorated manner drawing on Italian Gothic and especially Arab-Norman styles, similar to but more ornate that the original, completed in 1891. Architecture and fittings =Interior= The cathedral's central nave seen from the entrance A wooden 13th century Crucifix hangs in the liturgical area. Another crucifix, made of mother-of-pearl, was brought from the Holy Land and is located to the right of the back door. The High Altar in the central nave is formed from the sarcophagus of the Archbishop Pietro Capuano (died 1214). Above the altar is a painting by Andrea dell'Asta of The Martyrdom of St. Andrew. The boxed ceiling dates to 1702 and its artwork includes the Flagellation, the Crucifixion of the Apostle, and the Dell'Asta's 1710 Miracle of the Manna. The triumphal arch is held up by two Egyptian granite columns. There are two additional twisted columns and two pulpits that were part of the 12th century ambo. One of the pillars boasts a hidden column as an example of the ancient Romanesque structure. =Exterior= Painting of 1845 by Giacinto Gigante The front facade was rebuilt in the late 19th century in striped marble and stone, with a tall pediment decorated with mosaics, and a deep porch with windows of delicate Arab-Moorish tracery similar to, but more ornate than, the original. The tympanum's mosaics portray ‚ÄúThe triumph of Christ‚Äù in a work created by Domenico Morelli and whose original designs are retained in the Town Hall. Sixty-two steps, wide and steep, lead up to the doors. Cast in Constantinople before 1066, and signed by Simeon of Syria, the cathedral's bronze doors are the earliest in Italy of post-Roman manufacture. Begun in 1180, and completed over 100 years later, the Romanesque style bell tower is topped by a cluster of four small towers around a larger one, all decorated with brightly coloured majolica tiles forming interlaced Gothic arches in an Arab-Norman style. This is the most ornate example of type of medieval bell-tower found only in southern Italy. During times of war, the bell tower was purposed for defense. The garden contains colonnades, arches, and sculptures.

Colonel Wellington Henry Stapleton- Cotton, 2nd Viscount Combermere (24 November 1818 ‚Äì 1 December 1891) was a British soldier and Conservative politician. Background Combermere was born at Duncombe House, St. Thomas, Barbados, the son of Field Marshal Stapleton Stapleton-Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere (then Governor of Barbados and the Windward Islands), and Caroline, daughter of William Greville.thepeerage.com He was educated at Audlem Grammar School, Cheshire, and Eton College, then briefly attended Christ Church, Oxford in 1837 before entering the army. Military and political career Stapleton-Cotton was commissioned into the 7th Hussars in 1837, and served in Canada, where the regiment took part in suppressing the Papineau Rebellion, before returning to England in 1841, when he exchanged his commission into the 1st Life Guards. He was promoted captain in 1846, and major in 1850, holding a staff position as Secretary to the Master General of Ordnance from March to December 1852. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1857, and achieved the rank of full colonel in 1861, retiring from the army in 1866. Throughout his military career and on Combermere distinguished himself as a sportsman acquiring a reputation of being a good shooter, steeple chase rider, and keen fly- fisherman. He also bread horses, was a keen foxhunter, and often judged at the Royal Agricultural and other shows in Islington and Birmingham. In 1847 he was returned to Parliament for Carrickfergus, a seat he held until 1857.leighrayment.com In 1865 he succeeded his father in the viscountcy and entered the House of Lords. Family In 1844 Lord Combermere married Susan Alice, daughter of Sir George Sitwell, 2nd Baronet (1797-1853). They had two sons and two daughters. She died in August 1869. Lord Combermere survived his wife by 22 years and died of coronary thrombosis at his London home in St James' Place in December 1891, aged 73, seven weeks after being run over by a horse-drawn carriage. He was buried at St Margaret's Church, Wrenbury, Cheshire. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his eldest son, Robert. = Lord Combermere's ghost photo = The 2nd Viscount Combermere became a posthumous celebrity in connection with \\"Lord Combermere's Ghost Photo\\", taken in 1891 by Sybell Corbet. She was Lady Combermere's sister and staying at Combermere Abbey at that time. She set up her camera with its shutter open for one hour in the Abbey Library while the entire staff were out, attending Lord Combermere's funeral at St Margaret's Church, Wrenbury, some four miles away. When the plate was developed, the transparent image of a man sitting in one of the library chairs was noticed. Many of the staff said that the image looked like the late 2nd Viscount, and the apparition happened to be sitting in Lord Combermere's favourite chair. It is thought by some that a servant might have come into the room and sat briefly in the chair, thus creating the image. This idea was refuted by members of Lord Combermere's household.www.ghost- story.co.ukGhost Photos: Lord Combermere Lord Combermere's father, the 1st Viscount, had been involved in a mysterious incident himself several years earlier while serving as Governor of Barbados when he had the Chase Vault opened and carefully examined in search of an explanation for the \\"moving coffins\\" there.

They promote climate protection on three levels: avoidance techniques such as capacity building and teaching, reduction (which includes energy efficiency, renewable energy and management methods) and carbon offsetting. myclimate advocates for the development of a carbon market while setting new standards in carbon emissions and in designing a sustainable society.  The 3 pillars  =Avoid= myclimate promotes the gathering of knowledge about CO2 reduction, raises awareness and inspires long-term climate protection. To achieve these goals, myclimate works with schools, institutions and businesses, organises exhibitions, contests, designs schoolbooks and games. In 2008 the climate protection game TriCO2lor was awarded by the UNESCO. =Reduce= myclimate provides carbon assessment services, as well as more comprehensive life cycle assessments. In 2008, together with the Swiss ecological centre of Langenbruck, the association Climatop was founded which awards climate- positive products. The initiative thereby hopes to increase competition among producers and to encourage the development of better productsClimatop and promote ecodesign. The label is, among others, used by the biggest retailer in Switzerland, Migros.Migros In addition, businesses are provided a range of tools for the development of strategies, the analysis of products and the optimisation of existing processes. Furthermore, myclimate designs carbon neutral products, for example climate neutral printing.The Printing Union and myclimate =Offset= myclimate develops its own projects according to the CDM Gold Standard. This most stringent standard for carbon offsetting projects was developed by 21 NGOs, including the World Wide Fund for Nature. The Standard is supported by 60 NGOs worldwide. The Golden Standard is the only standard which certifies projects' sustainable development factors, e.g. co- benefit criteria like healthcare, job creation or reforestation.  Characteristic traits  In comparison to other climate protection companies working in the carbon market, myclimate has several unique characteristics: * it is a charity foundation * it operates within the \\"voluntary\\" carbon market (i.e., carbon offset is realized in addition to the Kyoto Protocol targets) * it generates \\"sustainability\\" carbon certificates in self-developed carbon offsetting projects (i.e., it does not trade carbon certificates).  Partners and Patronage  The original idea for myclimate comes from former students of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) and is academically supported by different institutes in the university, such as the ETH Centre for Sustainability, as well as the Swiss Federal Office for Energy.Partners in climate protectionInternational partners Its patrons include, among others, the Swiss Minister of the Environment Doris Leuthard and the former member of the German Bundestag Prof. Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker.Patronage committee The government of Liechtenstein, UNEP Global Civil Society Forum, Climate Friendly Civil Society Conference Gives Delegates Guilt-Free Travel the Swiss federal office for environmental protection or the Swiss WWF Climate Group compensate their emissions with myclimate.News  Market Insecurities  There is some controversy around the topic of emission reduction through carbon offset. There are several insecurities within the three trading markets under the so-called Kyoto flexible mechanisms (see also Carbon market mechanism), e.g. most standards lack of a proper quality assurance scheme which can lead to double counting or lacking Additionality. According to myclimate the CDM Gold Standard was developed to avoid these insecurities.Comparison of Carbon Markets  Studies  In 2006 the climate department of Tufts University in the United States examined 13 organisations that offer compensations for CO2 emissions. Criteria were transparency, exactness of the calculations, price of the certificates and administrative costs. myclimate was one of four suppliers who reached the mark \\"excellent\\".

Hetherington published his Poor Man's Guardian, a successor to his earlier (1830‚Äì31) penny daily Penny Papers for the People, as an outright challenge to authority. Published at the low price of a penny per weekly copy it bore the explicit heading: Published contrary to 'law' to try the power of 'might' against 'right'.Asa Briggs,Chartist Studies (Macmillan, 1959) The paper represented a fight against the consequences of the Six Acts of 1819, imposed by the Tories. The Acts aimed to combat the free, radicalized press seen as representative of a period of radicalism from 1816, which continued until 1820. They imposed a stamped (taxed) press; all publications appearing at less than 26-day intervals had to bear a government stamp and retail at 7d (3p) each. The Poor Man's Guardian was hugely influential upon the decision by the Whig government of Lord Melbourne to lower the tax to a point where newspapers could retail at 4d (1.5p). The paper claimed that the newspaper stamp was a tax on knowledge; it had the significant motto 'Knowledge is power'. Hetherington's paper was enormously successful and achieved sales of 15,000 copies a week all over the country despite being London-based. Bronterre O'Brien, later a regular contributor to the Northern Star, edited the Poor Man's Guardian from 1832.
