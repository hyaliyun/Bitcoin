The Amendment aimed to undo several changes that had been made to the Constitution by the 42ndAmendment which had been enacted by the Indira Gandhi- led Indian National Congress during the Emergency. Legislative history The bill of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 16December 1977 as the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1977. It was introduced by Shanti Bhushan, Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs. The bill sought to amend articles 19, 22, 30, 31A, 31C, 38, 74, 77, 83, 105, 123, 132, 133, 134, 139A, 150, 166, 172, 194, 213, 217, 225, 226, 227, 239B, 329, 352, 356, 358, 359, 360, 366, 368 and 371F and the Seventh and Ninth Schedules to the Constitution; substitute new articles for articles 71, 103 and 192; insert new articles 134A, 361A and Chapter IV in Part XIII of the Constitution; and omit articles 31, 257A and 329A and Part XIVA of the Constitution. The Bill also sought repeal sections 18, 19, 21, 22, 31, 32, 34, 35, 58 and 59 of the 42nd Amendment Act. The bill was debated by the Lok Sabha on 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22 and 23 August 1978. Clauses 1, 15 and 26 of the Bill were adopted by the Lok Sabha on 22 August with formal amendments to replace the word \\"Forty-fifth\\" with the word \\"Forty-fourth\\". Clauses 2 to 14, 16 to 20, 23 to 25, 27 to 40 and 42 to 49 were adopted in their original form. Clause 21, 22, and 41 of the bill were adopted by the House with amendments. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 23 August. The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered by the Rajya Sabha on 28, 29, 30 and 31 August. Clauses 1, 15 and 26 of the Bill were adopted by the Rajya Sabha on 31 August. However, the House rejected some clauses of the Bill. The motion to adopt clauses 8, 44 and 45 which would have amended articles 31C, 366 and 368 respectively failed to secure the required supermajority. Clause 35 of the Bill which sought to omit Part XIV-A of the Constitution also did not receive support. The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha with amendments on 31 August. The Bill, as amended by the Rajya Sabha, was considered by the Lok Sabha on 6 and 7 December. The House accepted the amendement made by the Rajya Sabha and the bill passed by the Lok Saba on 7 December 1978.

Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is the prime minister of the UAE, and her mother, Houria Ahmed Lamara, is from Algeria. She is the full sister of Sheikha Maitha (born 1980), Sheika Latifa (born 1985) and Sheikh Majid (born 1987). In 2000, whilst on holiday in the UK, she fled her family and stayed with friends in London. In August 2000, she was snatched by men working for her father off the street in Cambridge, and taken back to Dubai on a private jet. In 2020 a UK family court found that her father orchestrated her abduction.  Disappearance in 2000  In summer 2000, Shamsa was in the UK on holiday with her extended family residing at their Longcross estate near Chobham in Surrey. In an attempt to seek a better future for herself and escape restrictions on her life in Dubai, she used the opportunity to flee from her family in mid July. After her escape she stayed with friends for a few weeks in a London flat before being found by her family. In August 2000, Shamsa was forcefully picked up from the streets of Cambridge while walking out of a bar and taken back to Dubai on a private jet. In March 2001, after having been contacted by a British solicitor who had spoken to Shamsa, Cambridgeshire police began investigating the incident. During inquiries, people close to Shamsa in the UK substantiated her story of escape, and the matter was raised in Parliament; the police investigation stalled, however, due to denial of access to her by Dubai authorities and non- cooperation of the Longcross estate staff. According to the Foreign Office, Sheikh Mohammed himself tried to intervene with the British government over the police investigation. Shamsa has not been seen in public, after her disappearance.  2018 revival of investigation  In March 2018, Shamsa's sister Latifa also attempted to escape and was also forcefully recaptured and brought back to Dubai. Her video-statement corroborating story of Shamsa's attempted escape, her own abuse and their imprisonment in a family-owned compound brought the almost two decades old incident back into media focus. Appeals by various human rights groups and campaigners seeking release of the two sisters made a United Nations special rapporteur to seek official response from the UAE as well. A few months later in 2019, Princess Haya had to leave Dubai with her children reportedly due to feeling threatened after inquiring about the sisters on her own. In December 2018, the police investigation on Shamsa's disappearance was reopened after testimony of Shamsa's cousin Marcus Essabri (then Fatima Essabri) living in the UK, and their mutual correspondence before her disappearance made her wishes for freedom apparent.  2019 Court proceedings  In December 2019, a UK family court ruled that‚Äîon the balance of probabilities‚ÄîSheikh Mohammed orchestrated the abductions of Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa and subjected Princess Haya to a campaign of \\"intimidation\\"; the findings were published in March 2020.Re Al M [2019 EWHC 3415 (Fam)] Police have subsequently said that the lapsed investigation into Shamsa's disappearance is to be reviewed.

She is the founder of Marie Walton-Mahon Dance Academy and the founder of the Progressing Ballet Technique. Dancing career Marie Walton-Mahon's former ballet training was in Newcastle, Australia. Upon completing her Royal Academy of Dance qualifications, including honours in advanced RAD qualifications, she received the Solo Seal award in 1970.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NvBpoI6fzyQ She continued her studies in France with a scholarship at Rosella Hightower school in Cannas before joining Les Ballet de Marseille. The company toured in Europe with Maya Plisetskaya.. Later Walton-Mahon had to return to Australia ending her solo dance career prematurely in 1974, due to her father's ill health. Teaching career Upon returning to Australia she opened her own dance academy, the Marie Walton-Mahon Dance Academy, and went on to produce many famous ballet dances with successful solo careers. Walton-Mahon remained as the artistic director/principle at the academy for almost 38 years. In early 1980s her students were able to secure places at prestigious ballet companies such as Australian Ballet Company, New York Ballet Theatre, Royal New Zealand Ballet Company and Birmingham Royal ballet. During this period her students also won awards at the Gene√© international ballet competition including two gold awards. In 2005, Walton-Mahon was invited to the board of examiners for the Royal Academy of Dance. In 2007 she founded the National College of Dance in Newcastle. She was a Royal Academy of Dance Examiner and a teacher until she resigned from its duties in 2018. In 2016 Walton-Mahon was invited by the RAD as a standardisation and Solo Seal Examiner. Innovations and teaching technique Walton-Mahon started studying books on anatomy and in 1979 started training with Valarie Grieg who is the author of inside ballet technique. This experience inspired Walton-Mahon to learn and create innovative and safe teaching styles. In the mid 90s Walton-Mahon commenced working with a group of 10 year old students with the use of stability balls and found that they became more aware of their posture, alignment and weight placement within just three months. This finding made her explore further into this concept of teaching. In 2006 she further experimented with these exercises and started creating PBT using a 16 year old male student, Daniel Roberge who had no former ballet training at that time and given instructions to practice according to the PBT technique. Two years later he went on completing all senior examinations, winning the silver award at Gen√©e International Competition 2007 held in Singapore. Walton-Mahon created the Progressing Ballet Technique which is used as a teaching technique around the world. As part of her passion for safe training and innovation, she launched ‚Äúbackalast‚Äù a special posture jacket to assist with the famous ‚Äòtech-neck‚Äô condition. She was able to launch the product after four years on research in the field. Personnel life Walton-Mahon is married to Paddy Mahon and she has two children, Veronica and Laurie.

After serving in the First World War, he joined the circle of artists associated with Conrad Felixm√ºller; which included Otto Griebel, Otto Dix and Elfriede Lohse- W√§chtler. In 1921 he, his wife Susanna and son Ra moved from Dresden to Wehlen, where they lived until 1938. There, they had a second son; Constantin. He created a summer studio at an isolated quarry near (a hamlet near Wehlen) where he painted portraits, animals, still-lifes and landscapes. Hitler's rise to power ended Cassel's career. In 1933, his works were classified as \\"degenerate art\\". Many of his paintings were confiscated and shown at the Degenerate Art Exhibition of 1937, in Munich. In hopes of regaining some positive recognition, he joined the Nazi Party, but the only result of this was the loss of all his friends. The hoped-for rehabilitation never came and he had to work as a manual laborer in the quarries until 1939, when he was assigned to the Hydraulic Engineering Department in Pirna. In March 1944, he was drafted and sent to the Eastern Front, but was soon taken prisoner by the Red Army. He died the following year, in Soviet captivity, in what is now Moldova.Rainer Zimmermann: Expressiver Realismus. Malerei der verschollenen Generation, Hirmer, M√ºnchen 1994, S. 360. His works were largely forgotten until after 2000. Since then, there have been two major retrospectives; at the Lindenau-Museum (2005) and the (2011/12).

Xi succeeded as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and became the paramount leader in 2012. Xi has reportedly taken a hard-line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage. His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.  Republic of China (Taiwan)   Americas  = United States = Xi giving a speech at the U.S. Department of State in 2012, with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then Vice-President Joe Biden in the background. Seated in the front row is former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Xi has called China‚ÄìUnited States relations in the contemporary world a \\"new type of great-power relations\\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace. Under his administration the Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued. On China‚ÄìU.S. relations, Xi said, \\"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\\". The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office. Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \\"strategic pivot\\" to Asia. Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \\"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\\", he told the conference. In spite of what seemed to be a tumultuous start to Xi Jinping's leadership vis-√†-vis the United-States, on 13 May 2017 Xi said at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing: \\"We should foster a new type of international relations featuring 'win-win cooperation', and we should forge a partnership of dialogue with no confrontation, and a partnership of friendship rather than alliance. All countries should respect each other's sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity; respect each other's development path and its social systems, and respect each other's core interests and major concerns... What we hope to create is a big family of harmonious coexistence.\\"  Asia  = Iran = Xi with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, 23 January 2016 On 4 June 2019, Xi told the Russian news agency TASS that he was \\"worried\\" about the current tensions between the U.S. and Iran. He later told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani during an SCO meeting that China would promote ties with Iran regardless of developments from the Gulf of Oman incident. = Japan = China‚ÄìJapan relations have soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013. = Korea = Under Xi China has also taken a more critical stance on North Korea, while improving relationships with South Korea. Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the THAAD purchase of the latter while China's relations with North Korea increased because of meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \\"timely easing\\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.  Europe  Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2015 = Russia = Xi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests. Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.  Public opion  In the 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on attitude to Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea. The survey indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence. These number are almost same with those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).

He served as Director of the PLA Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Research and the Beijing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy Laboratory. Known for his research on hematopoietic stem cell therapy for leukemia, he was awarded the State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class) in 2015 and the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize in 2016. In 2017, he and Deng Hongkui engineered resistance to HIV in mice using CRISPR gene editing, and for the first time used the technique on an AIDS patient. He died of a sudden heart attack before their findings were published.  Biography  Chen Hu was born 17 February 1962 in Chongqing, China, with his ancestral home in Luoyang, Henan. He enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in September 1979 and enrolled at the Third Military Medical University (now Army Medical University). He earned both a Ph.D. and an M.D. After graduation, Chen became a physician at the Affiliated Hospital of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. He later served as Director of the Beijing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy Laboratory and Director of the PLA Institute of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Research at the Fifth Medical Center (formerly the 307 Hospital) of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing. Chen spent more than 30 years researching treatment for leukemia, with a focus on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapy. He treated more than 40,000 patients and performed over 3,200 HSC transplants, improving the survival rate from nearly 0% at the beginning to 65%. In 2015, his research on the treatment of radiation damage using adult stem cells won the State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class). A year later, he won the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize for Science and Technology Progress. In 2017, Chen and his collaborator, Deng Hongkui of Peking University, used CRISPR gene editing to transplant human HSCs with the edited CCR5 gene to mice, and conferred HIV resistance to the animals. They subsequently used the technique to treat an AIDS patient who suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It was the first time CRISPR was used on a human HIV patient. 19 months later, the patient's ALL was in complete remission. Their research demonstrated the safety of CRISPR for humans, although the therapy was not effective for curing AIDS as only 5% to 8% of the patient's bone marrow cells carried the edited CCR5 gene, much lower than the ideal 100%. Their research was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2019, after Chen had died. On 24 July 2019, Chen Hu died from a sudden heart attack in Beijing, aged 57. At the time of his death he was a candidate for election to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Background Prior to the Syrian Civil War Khawla was reportedly involved in stealing motorcycles and was imprisoned for it by Syrian state authorities. As the war began he joined the Syrian Opposition in Deir ez-Zor and established his own militia which allegedly took part in running checkpoints that would extort and steal from drivers. Biography =Prior to SDF= In 2013 he and his group assisted the Syrian rebels in besieging the 113th Brigade of the Syrian army in Deir ez-Zor. In 2014 after the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) he pledged allegiance to the group. However he later left the group and fled to Turkey after ISIL executed his brother. =After joining SDF= By February 2016 he had returned to Syria and claimed to have established a new group allied with the Syrian Democratic Forces, opposed to ISIL. In March 2016, he formally announced that he and his group had joined SDF, and he would later become the spokesman of SDF's Deir ez-Zor Military Council. On 24 March 16, he announced that the Deir ez-Zor Military Council had captured several villages from ISIL in northwestern Deir ez-Zor. In February 2017, he was arrested by the SDF which accused him and his group known as the \\"Gathering of the Baggara Youth\\" of not effectively participating in SDF's offensive against ISIL, however activists and individuals linked to him and his group claimed SDF arrested him for his desire to integrate fighters who had defected from groups that took part in Operation Euphrates Shield into his ranks. He was held for at least four days and later released. In September 2017, during a standoff between Syrian government forces and the SDF, he said speaking on behalf of the SDF and the Deir ez-Zor Military Council, that the SDF would fight the Syrian government if they attacked or entered SDF held areas and he also claimed that the SDF would take over all of Deir ez-Zor. In April 2019, activists reported that he became involved with oil smuggling from Deir ez-Zor with an individual known as \\"Abu Bakr al-Homsi\\", that reportedly served as a broker on behalf of a company, between the SDF and the Syrian government, and he had also previously organized oil sales on behalf of ISIL. In July 2019, during an interview Khawla stated that he and his groups cooperated with the governments of Russia and Iraq. However he denied any cooperation with the Syrian government or Iran and criticized efforts by Iran and groups linked to Iran for spreading the Shiite sect in eastern Syria, and referred to them as occupation forces. He also stated that he had recruited several fighters from Turkish-backed groups and tribal militias in Deir ez-Zor, and he referred to areas under the control of Turkey and allied opposition groups as liberated areas. He also said if he were authorized by the coalition to attack Iranian forces and allied Shiite militias in Deir ez-Zor he would, and said regarding Iranian efforts to promote Shiism in Deir ez-Zor, \\"civilians are being displaced and killed, the names of Sunni mosques are being replaced with Shiite ones and religious centers are being constructed for them\\".

It is then that he encounters violence and hatred from some greedy men. The film was released theatrically on 15 January 2020, coinciding with Sankranthi. Plot When her train halts at Yelamanchili due to a blockage, Nandini tells a group of women about her lover Balu in a flashback. As a young boy, the death of Balu's parents leaves him abandoned. Nandini's father helps Balu by getting him into a boys hostel. 15 years later, Balu grows up to become a short film actor often referred to as Hero by Nandini, while the former refers her to as \\"Producer\\". One day, she sees an army uniform in his bag and suspects him. She sends two of her partners to spy on Balu, who discover he is Surya, an army officer with a brother. Similarly, they find a photograph of Balu with an old couple performing Tulabhara as their grandson Shiva. Balu then celebrates Raksha Bandhan with a woman as her brother Rishi. Nandini and team meet Balu at a cafe and question him about his multiple identities. It is then revealed he stopped the old couple, who were left abandoned by their grandson, from committing suicide and being a grandson to them. He agreed to act as a deceased soldier and the brother of a mentally unstable man. He also saved a woman from getting harassed by goons, beating them up and openly proclaiming himself as her brother. Balu then decides to start an organization named as All is well Emotion Suppliers to help people by sending an actor as the relative they want. One day, Balu and Nandini are approached by a woman who wants a son for the happiness of her husband Rama Sharma who is diagnosed with cancer and had lost their son years ago. Balu assumes the identity of Acharya, their son, making Rama Sharma happy about his return. However, an illegal land miner named Gangaraju tries to forcibly acquire signature on a document from Rama Sharma, resulting in two brawls and Gangaraju's arrest. Balu and Nandini are happy to see their organization running successfully for 6 months. However, the old couple's grandson arrives from America with goons and vandalizes the office. Balu thrashes them, before the old couple arrive to stop him. The old man reveals he transferred his property to Balu because of his love towards them as opposed to how their own grandson treated them. Balu convinces them to not relate love and wealth, and slaps the grandson who was angry for the loss of property. Later, Rama Sharma reveals he knows Balu is not his son, since a man showed him an ad of Balu and Nandini. He slaps Balu and tells him to leave, but Nandini explains Balu's true love for him. Realizing his fault, he re-accepts Balu but later succumbs to cancer. Balu hands over flight tickets for Kashi to Acharya's mother and assures her she can later live with him. Nandini, her fianc√© Kishore and Balu are on a car trip and their car breaks down in Munnar, where an old man assists them and takes them to his marriage anniversary party. Meeting his Telugu-speaking wife who misses her relatives, Balu reveals he is her nephew and Nandini tells her she is his wife. The woman gifts the couple before they leave, and Balu reveals he lied to her but also explained his intentions to the old man who made him promise to continue the relation. Seeing Nandini and Balu's love for each other, Kishore refuses to marry her. Eventually, Nandini and Balu get married. Back to present, Nandini reveals she is 3-months pregnant and leaves the train with her family after Balu tells her to meet him at a point. A priest who claimed to predict Nandini's future runs to inform her about an upcoming obstacle. However, he misses her and Nandini joins Balu and the whole family on a boat. However, a recently released Gangaraju attacks the boat with his henchmen. In the ensuing fight, Nandini is injured and thrown into water. Balu rescues her and kills Gangaraju before himself getting fatally stabbed. A dying Balu is admitted to a hospital where he convinces everyone to move on.

It was built to connect Imaichi, Shimotsuke Province (in modern-day Tochigi Prefecture) with Aizuwakamatsu Castle in modern-day Fukushima Prefecture. It is roughly traced by Japan National Route 121 and Fukushima Prefectural Route 131. Ouchi-juku Historical Sites sightseeing - Travel Fukushima. Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association. Retrieved September 22, 2019. History and background With the establishment of Aizu Domain, the daimy≈ç Hoshina Masayuki (1611-1673) called for the construction of a road to connect his castle with the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, which was the main route north-south from the Tokugawa shogunate's capital of Edo. Part of the reason for this road was economic, as the Aizu area was geographically isolated by mountains. It was also political, as the daimy≈ç of Aizu were required to travel back-and-forth to Edo on alternative years with a large retinue under the sankin-k≈çtai system and needed a well-maintained road with suitable post stations for rest and resupply along the route. The road Hoshina Masayuki created was marked with ichirizuka distance markers to facilitate travel. The road was named the or sometimes the . In addition to Aizu Domain, the route also proved popular with the sankin-k≈çtai retinues of Shibata Domain, Murakami Domain, Sh≈çnai Domain and Yonezawa Domain. The route was closed from 1683 to 1723, when a landslide blocked the Kinugawa River creating a natural dam.

Picture published in S√ºdsee- Erinnerungen, p 123. Hernsheim & Co was a German trading company in the Western Pacific Ocean with main offices on Yap (Caroline Islands), Jaluit (Marshall Islands) and Matupi (Bismarck Archipelago). The company was specialized in the copra export to Europe and tried after the loss of their possessions in the South Seas (1918), a new beginning in the French Mandate area of Cameroon (Central Africa). In the heyday of their South Sea business (circa 1882-1885), Hernsheim & Co exported almost 30% of the copra produced in the Western Pacific Ocean. Many of their agents were also dealers in ethnographic objects.  In Oceania  = Founding and start capital (1875) = Hernsheim & Co was founded in November 1875 by the brothers Franz and Eduard Hernsheim in Sydney (Australia). The start capital consisted of the South Sea stations Malakal (Koror, Palau), Nif and Tomil (Caroline Islands) and Niata (Duke of York Islands), already built by Eduard Hernsheim, and the schooner Coeran. Franz Hernsheim put in M 50,000. Furthermore, the Hamburg merchant Ruben Jonas Robertson, an uncle of the Hernsheims, offered loans. = First Expansion (1876-1882) = Between January and August 1876 Eduard Hernsheim did new reconnaissance trips which led to the founding of Makada, a first central station for the Bismarck Archipelago on the island Makada (Duke- of-York Group). A second central station, Jaluit, was founded for the Marshall Islands on the island Jabor (Jaluit Atoll) followed. In addition, in the Ratak Chain (eastern Marshall Islands) five dealers were contracted and then probably a trading post on Ponape (formerly Pohnpei, Caroline Islands) was also founded. From the middle of 1876, the agent J. T. Blohm made trade contacts with the Talilibai and Kabaira (northern beaches of the Gazelle Peninsula), as well as the district of Birara (southern Blanche bay, all New Britain archipelago)Anderhandt (2012) Bd. 1, p. 202.. Until 1883 on the Gazelle Peninsula the stations Kurakaul, Ragunai, Kabaira, Vlavolo / Nogai and Pulpul / Kabaira (northern beaches), and Rolavio (port island Matupi, Blanche bay), Ruluana, Urakukuni, Ululai, Lagumgum, Tarram and Tawana (bank of the Blanche bay / District Birara) were founded. In June 1879, due to a malaria epidemic, the central station for the New Britain archipelago was moved from Makada to Matupi. The existing on Matupi station was expanded to the factories and supplemented by a second factory on the east coast of the island. In February 1880, at the beginning of another series of exploratory voyages, now with the small-scale Pacific and Alice, once again stations were founded, now in the village of Pakail and on the port island of Nusa (Northern New Ireland)Anderhandt (2012) Bd. 1, p. 348, 447. By the agent Friedrich Schulle these trade relations were extended to the east coast of New Ireland (stations Kablaman, Butbut, Navangai, Lamerotte, Lagumbanje, Lauaru and Kapsu). On other reconnaissance trips by Eduard Hernsheim it came only sporadically to the establishment of new stations: Woleai atoll (formerly Uleai, March 1878), Kosrae (formerly Kusaie, Caroline Islands, August 1878), Nauru (September 1878), Carcone (Hermit Islands, Western Islands, June 1879) and Oberlark (Laughlan Islands, Louisiades, beginning (?) 1881)Anderhandt (2012) Bd. 2, p. 576‚Äì591. Franz Hernsheim took over the management of the Jaluit business in 1877 and established in early 1878 a ship connection to the Gilbert group, over which copra purchases from the islands of Apamama, Aranuka and Kuria were introduced to the central warehouse on Jabor from 1883/84Anderhandt (2012) Bd. 1, p. 219, 222. He lived on Jaluit and served as German Consul. He was still on Jaluit in 1885 at the German acquisition of the Marshalls, but left the island in January 1886 to return to Europe. For the business on Yap in March 1878 and March 1880 the American captains C. P. Holcomb and D. D. O'Keefe were won as general agents for Yap or the St. David's island. However, these connections were resolved again in April 1884. = Introduction of an \\"Agent System\\" (1882-1885) = The expansion of the field of activity to a large part of the western Pacific Ocean and the exploding operating costs to maintain traffic between the three main stations Yap, Jaluit and Matupi forced Hernsheim & Co to consolidate in October 1882. Instead of small drifters, the inter-island traffic was increasingly provided by cheaper sailing ships and outsourced the import and export from / to Europe on charter vessels. In the New Britain archipelago, the number of trading stations was reduced and the exchange transaction was transferred to independent agents who regulated the traffic with the local negotiators or suppliers in their own responsibility. From October 1885, through the partnership with Mouton, Dupr√© & Co. the former dealer Friedrich Schulle acted as a general agent for northern Gazelle peninsula, New Ireland. General agent for Yap was Robert Friedl√§nder. He had been sent out by the Hamburg mother house since December 1883. A cutthroat competition in the Marshall Group with the German Trading and Plantation Company of the South Sea Islands of Hamburg (DHPG) forced Hernsheim & Co to unite their possessions there with those of their rivals. = Concentration on the Matupi Branch and Diversification (1886-1892) = On the protection declaration of the German Reich over the New Kingdom archipelago (November / December 1884, renamed after that afterwards in Bismarck archipelago) reacted Hernsheim & Co with a restructuring of their company possession. The branches of the Marshall Group and the Yap group were merged with those of the German Trading and Plantation Society of the South Sea Islands of Hamburg (DHPG) to Jaluit Society (December 1887). In contrast, the Matupi branch was outsourced, taken over by Eduard Hernsheim in sole responsibility and converted into the Hernsheim & Co OHG (1888/89). Following individual deliveries to SMS Habicht, Carola, Hy√§ne and Albatros, as well as to HMS Espi√®gle and Dart on the English side, Hernsheim & Co OHG was able to get a coal supply contract with the Imperial Navy signed by the Hamburg parent company Robertson & Hernsheim (see below) with the Royal British Navy and extend the former repeatedly until 1914. This, as well as supply contracts with small businesses and public entities in the protected area, including the Wesleyan Mission, allowed the Company to cross-finance its co-buyer business and give it the competitive edge ahead of DHPG and E.E. Forsayth. Increasing profits from 1888 led to the conversion into a limited partnership (1901) and finally to the transfer into a corporation with a registered capital 1.2 million marks (1909, seat Hamburg). = Second expansion in trade and extensive plantation economy (1893-1914) = Maximilian Thiel was in charge for the new management of the Bismarck Archipelago which included the Admiralty Islands (stations of Komuli and Manus), the Ninigo Islands, the Solomon Islands (stations Bouka and Choiseul), the St. Matthias Group and the Portland Islands. For reasons of space a new relocation of the main station was made in 1912 from Matupi to Rabaul. An intensive plantation strategy according to the scheme of DHPG and E.E. Forsayth was applied by Hernsheim & Co. The company operated labor- intensive plantations involving the importation of foreign workers in the grasslands near Rabaul and on their property on Makada (Duke-of-York group), also on Nusa, Nusalik and in Pakail (all New Ireland). Through expanding their palm tree cultivations in 1912 the company could increase its share capital by M 600,000.  In Australia and in Cameroon  = Participation in Melanesia Co. Ltd. (1928-1930) = After the peace agreement of Versailles, all possessions of Hernsheim & Co AG in the former protected area German New Guinea were confiscated by the Australian Mandate Authority. After passing the war indemnification law (1928) the company received from Germany 13% of their recognized claim for damages i.H.v. 14 million marks plus a rebuilding surcharge of 2%. Together with the Hamburgische S√ºdsee-Aktiengesellschaft (HASAG), Hernsheim & Co acquired a stake in the London-based Melanesia Company Ltd., which had acquired parts of the company property of both companies in the former German protected area. As a result of Black Friday (1929), the Melanesia Company ran into trouble; a joint attempt by HASAG and Hernsheim & Co to sell their shares failed. After a collapse of the copra market in the financial year 1930, the plantations and plantations run by the Melanesia Company had to be sold at such a low price that not even the preferred main creditors - which included neither HASAG nor Hernsheim & Co AG - could be satisfied. = Palm oil production in Ed√©a (1928-1939) = As part of the so- called \\"prior compensation\\", Hernsheim & Co AG received a share in i.H.v. RM 900,000, - of their recognized claim for damages from the Weimar government. The former managing director for the Bismarck Archipelago, Maximilian Thiel, now CEO in Hamburg, initially invested this sum in the Dutch East Indies. From 1928 he also participated in the production of palm oil in Ed√©a (French Mandate of Cameroon). Because of further collapses in the copra and palm oil market, the company had to accept new heavy losses from 1930, so that a settlement was only possible through write-offs and the inclusion of a mortgage on the property in Ed√©a. Since 1932, the shares of Hernsheim & Co circulated only with a \\"memorial value\\" of RM 1, - in the books. After losses had been written without exception in the following years, the liquidation was initiated on January 7, 1939.

Retrieved 22 September 2019 was a German boxer, who was a champion of Europe as both an amateur and a professional. He won German amateur titles at three weights, was European amateur champion at light heavyweight, and as a professional won the German and European heavyweight titles. Career Born in Cologne, M√ºller first had success as an amateur. He won a bronze medal at the 1925 European Championships in Stockholm in the welterweight division,1\\\\. European Championships - Stockholm, Sweden, 1925 and in 1927 in Berlin, he won gold at light heavyweight.2\\\\. European Championships - Berlin, Germany, 1927 He won the German national championship three times, in 1925 at welterweight, in 1926 at middleweight, and in 1927 at light heavyweight. In 1927, M√ºller turned professional, making his pro debut at light heavyweight in April that year. He was unbeaten in close to twenty fights by the end of 1928, including wins over former Scandinavian middleweight champion Martin Tancred, future French champion Abel Argote, former German (VDF) heavyweight champion Hans Breitenstraeter, the only fight he failed to win during this period a controversial draw with future British champion Harry Crossley which resulted in the referee being suspended by the German authorities and Crossley instructed to omit the fight from his record. In February 1929 he beat Hein Heeser on points over 15 rounds to take the VDF German light heavyweight title. He followed this two months later with a points win over Gipsy Daniels. In June 1929 he challenged for Michele Bonaglia's IBU European light heavyweight title in Turin, the Italian stopping him in the fourth round. M√ºller moved up to heavyweight, and after a draw with German (VDF) champion Hans Schoenrath in a non-title fight in November 1930, faced him with the title at stake in February 1931. M√ºller took a points decision to become German heavyweight champion. In August he beat Pierre Charles on points to take the IBU European heavyweight title.Boyd White, Iain & Frisby, David (2013) Metropolis Berlin: 1880-1940, University of California Press, , p. 545 He was stripped of the title after failing to fight mandatory challenger Otto von Porat. In January 1932 he beat Reggie Meen at the Granby Halls in Leicester, Meen being forced to stop in the fourth round due to an eye injury. The fight was subsequently recognized by the IBU as a European title fight, with M√ºller regaining the title. He had been due to fight Larry Gains early in 1932, but he was forced to withdraw due to a badly-bruised chest, with Don McCorkindale taking his place. He suffered only the second defeat of his professional career in April 1932, when he was beaten on points by McCorkindale at the Royal Albert Hall, McCorkindale a substitute for Gains who had injured his thumb (the agreed fight with Gains required the lifting of the colour bar that had been in place at the venue since 1923), and in his next fight, in May, lost his European title, with Charles taking a points verdict to regain his title. M√ºller's career never recovered, winning only two of his last nine fights (over Hans Schoenrath and Gustave Limousin), suffering knockouts at the hands of von Porat and Jack Petersen (in front of 50,000 spectators at Ninian Park), and failing in three attempts to take the BDB German heavyweight title from Vincenz Hower. In April 1934, M√ºller announced his decision to retire from boxing and return to his former profession as a baker. He did, however, return for one more fight, an eighth-round stoppage loss to Erwin Klein in November 1934. He retired with a record of 32 wins from 47 fights. After retiring from boxing, M√ºller took up professional wrestling, competing in the UK in the late 1930s. During World War II, M√ºller was initially exempted from military service due to an eye condition, but in March 1945 he was enrolled into the Volkssturm. He was shot dead by Allied forces during fighting for Berlin on 29 April 1945.

It is the first in her Runnymede series of book about a small town on the Mason-Dixon line and its sometimes eccentric residents. It is also the first of the Hunsenmeir trilogy, a subset of the Runnymede series, which focuses on the elderly Hunsenmeir sisters. According to Brown, the sisters are based on her own mother and aunt, who \\"do tend to dominate in a way\\", and the town is based on her own birthplace, about which she says: \\"It‚Äôs really interesting to have one foot in the North and one foot in the South.\\"  Plot Synopsis  Six of One is set in Runnymede, a Maryland town that straddles the Mason-Dixon Line. The narrative moves back and forth in time, following a colorful cast of characters. Thirty-five-year- old Nickel (Nicole), a bisexual woman, is the first-person narrator. Her adoptive mother, Juts (Julia Ellen), and aunt Wheeze (Louise) Hunsenmeir have been quibbling and making up since they were small girls in 1908, the earliest part of the story. In 1980, the contemporary part of the novel, the sisters are in their 70s and still at it. Most of the characters are female, each with her own over-the-top propensities: Celeste Chalfonte murders the local weapons tycoon for principle, and shares her lover Ramelle with her brother. Cora, Celeste's servant and friend, illiterate, simple and hardworking, is the mother of the bickering Hunsenmeir sisters. Fannie Jump Creighton turns her aristocratic home into a speakeasy during prohibition, to survive the great depression. Events both minor and historic are treated with light humor, with only the occasional more serious tone.  Characters  * Nicole \\"Nickel\\" Smith: First-person narrator, a young bisexual writer, who has returned to her home town to figure out her next step in life. Juts is her adopted mother. * Louise \\"Wheezie\\" and Julia \\"Juts\\" Hunsenmeir: Boldly eccentric sisters. Wheezie and Juts spend their whole lives in Runnymede, deeply devoted to each other, though constantly bickering and holding grudges. * Celeste Chalfonte: Headstrong and aristocratic, Celeste is the witty intellectual lesbian heiress, living with her beautiful young lover Ramelle in her mansion on the hill. * Cora Hunsenmeir: Mother of Wheezie and Juts, and lifelong friend and servant of Celeste. * Fannie Jump Creighton: Highly sexual and alcohol loving southern belle, who runs a speakeasy in her home. * Ramelle Bowman: Celeste's long term partner. Has a child with Celeste's brother, Curtis.  The Runnymede series  * Six of One (1978), Harper & Row * Bingo (1988), Bantam * Loose Lips (1999), Bantam * The Sand Castle (2008), Grove/Atlantic * Cakewalk (2016), Bantam  Reception  Susanna Rodell, in Harvard University's Crimson Review, writes that \\"Six of One is an attempt to construct a fictional feminist history of the 20th century in America, through the lives of women living in a small town in Maryland.\\" She finds the book \\"fun\\", with dialog that is \\"rich and raunchy, often delightful\\". She does find the style of the novel \\"uneven\\", but only on an \\"essentially cosmetic\\" level. The Kirkus review of Six of One states: \\"Though the march through time gets a little forced at times, Brown is always ready to bring us back to Runnymeade and its pranks... At her winning, fondest best, Brown has some of the same effervescent yet secure trust in her local characters that Eudora Welty feels for hers. Girls are more fun, seems to be the message; on the evidence of these here--no argument. Amanda Bearse, writing for The Advocate, called Six of One \\"an easy and delightful read\\". In the Washington Post Book World, Cynthia McDonald raved about the book because \\"The vision of women we have usually gotten from women novelists is of pain and struggle or pain and passivity; it is seldom joyous and passionate, and almost never funny. And what humor there was has been of the suffering, self-deprecating New York Jewish stand-up comedian type. Six of One by Rita Mae Brown is joyous, passionate and funny. What a pleasure!\\"  Awards  Brown received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Massachusetts Arts Council to publish Six of One.

They are sometimes claimed to have the longest continuous span of silversmithing of any American family. * William Moulton (1615-1664) immigrated in 1637 with his two brothers John and Thomas from Norfolk, England, and settled on Winnacunnet Road in Hampton, New Hampshire. * William Moulton II (1664-1732) left the family farm in Hampton in 1682, at age 18, and settled near the Merrimack River in a section of Newbury, Massachusetts that would later become Newburyport. By some accounts, he was the first in six generations of silversmiths. While he did buy and sell silver goods, he was primarily a general trader. His son Joseph Moulton (1694-1750) has also been proposed as the first Moulton to work in silver, but he was actually a blacksmith by trade, though he likely turned his hand to whatever came through his shop door. Although most of the Moultons carried on their craft in Newburyport, some went to other communities where they established themselves as silversmiths. * William Moulton III (1720‚Äì1793) was the first verified silversmith. He worked from 1742 to 1762 as a silversmith in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and from 1762 to 1788 in Hampstead, New Hampshire. He then moved in a covered wagon to Marietta, Ohio, carrying his silversmith's tools with him. He was one of the forty-eight pioneers to settle in the Northwest Territory, and is considered one of its founders. * Joseph Moulton (1744‚Äì1816), his son and the fourth in line, worked from about 1764 to 1810 as a silversmith in Newburyport, with home and shop on State Street. He had four sons who were silversmiths. 1) Ebenezer moved to Boston. 2) Enoch moved to Portland, Maine, each of them continuing their crafts in their respective places. 3) Abel inherited his father's business in Newburyport. * William Moulton IV (1772‚Äì1861) was the fifth in line of the Moulton chain. He worked from 1795 to 1845 as a silversmith in Newburyport, Massachusetts, establishing his own shop there. In addition to supplying church silver and other vessels, he made jewelry in his shop on Merrimack Street. William had two apprentices, Anthony Francis Towle and William P. Jones. * Joseph Moulton (1814‚Äì1903), his son and the sixth and final in line, in 1857 sold the silver business he inherited to his father's two apprentices, Anthony Francis Towle and William P. Jones (who were also his apprentices), to form Towle & Jones, Co. In 1873, the son of Anthony Francis Towle, Edward Bass Towle, was added to the business, and the name was changed to A.F. Towle & Son. It was in business through 1902, at which point their dies were purchased by Rogers, Lunt and Bowlen, who were later to become Lunt Silversmiths. A number of examples of early silver items produced by the Moulton family are in the Strawbery Banke Museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

History  In 1306, king Frederick III of Sicily, devoted to Maria Santissima Annunziata and in order to thank her for the graces he had received, donated the lands near Altofonte to the Cistercian Order, because he wanted an abbey to be built in order to enhance the cult for the Virgin Mary. Three years later, the king saw the merits of these friars and gave also the lands in the park of Partinico (that in the previous years had been devastated by Saracens. So it was up to these abbots to provide for the rebuilding of this small town, but they started works only at about 1430 A.D. They gave Partinico the coat of arms and tried to repopulate it; a group of friars settled in the wood in order to administer the assets they had received and give a civil and religious education to the new settlers. The abbot Pietro Guzio started the restoration works of a small church in order to let Federico II to attend mass when he was hunting in that area. In 1774, Frederick III of Sicily gave his financial support to the restoration of the sanctuary: it was enlarged with three naves, and the vaults supported by four stucco columns. In order to satisfy the wish of all the community of Partinico, grateful towards the Virgin who had saved the town from cholera in 1854, they made the request for the coronation of the holy Image: it took place in 1861, and the were five days of celebrations on that occasion. In 2000, with the Great Jubilee, the sanctuary was chosen as a place of pilgrimage to get indulgences, and in 2010 it was associated to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.  The painting  The painting of the Virgin Mary, realized by Vincenzo Manno in 1819 The first image was a copy (painted or sculpted) of that one venerated at Altofonte and still existing there; later it got ruined as time passed by. In 1669, the bishop of Mazara del Vallo gave the permit to build an altar in the Mother Church of Partinico with the image of Maria Santissima del Ponte. In 1795, as humidity had ruined the painting, they had another copy made by the painter Domenico Ferrandina: it was used the old canvas already consumed. The present painting was realized by Vincenzo Manno in 1819, and has been restored several times. Our Lady is represented on the throne: with an arm she is holding the Christ Child, who is stretching out his hands towards her, while her right hand is holding a heart; on the two sides there are Saint Peter, with a book and keys in his hands, and Paul the Apostle (or saint John the Apostle) with a book and a lily. Below them we can see a bridge, which recalls the old one on the river Jato that is near this place.  The feast  It takes place in the week following Easter from Thursday to Saturday; thousands of devotees go on a pilgrimage to the sanctuary with torches lit. At the same time, some folkloristic events take place. On the day of the feast (Sunday) at 12 o‚Äôclock sharp, the painting is put on a vara and starts towards Partinico: in the evening, when it arrives, is received by the civil authorities, the clergy and the townspeople; then it goes round the streets of the small town. At about midnight the procession arrives at the Mother Church, where the painting will remain and people go there to pray the Holy Virgin; in August there will be three days‚Äô celebrations, with folkloristic events, and in November it will be taken back to the sanctuary. People from Partinico, Balestrate, Trappeto and Alcamo take part in this feast; according to tradition, if the painting goes out from the small Church at 12 o‚Äôclock, i twill belong to the people of Partinico, if it is late (until 12,30), it will belong to the people of Alcamo, and if it goes out from 12,30 to 13,00 it will belong to Balestrate, and finally to Trappeto. In fact, according to Giuseppe Pitr√®, the legend says that there were four people from the neighbour towns to competing for the property of The Madonna, miraculously found in a grotto; as the chart carrying the statue was not moving towards any of the four towns, they decided to build a small Church there in order to venerate it all together.

The commandery was established as Hengshan by the Qin state after it annexed the state of Zhao. After the foundation of Han dynasty, it became part of the Zhao Kingdom. During Empress Dowager L√º's reign, it was briefly granted to Liu Buyi (Âäâ‰∏çÁñë), son of the Emperor Hui, as his fief. After the death of Buyi, the territory was first passed to Liu Hong, Emperor Houshao of Han, then it was granted to Liu Chao (ÂäâÊúù), another son of Emperor Hui. During the defeat of the L√º clan, Liu Chao was killed and the territory again became a commandery of Zhao. The name was later changed to Changshan for the naming taboo of Emperor Wen of Han (personal name Liu Heng). The territory became a separate principality in 145 BC during Emperor Jing's reign, and was granted to Liu Shun (ÂäâËàú). In 113 BC, Shun's successor Liu Bo (ÂäâÂãÉ) was deposed and the principality was abolished. A brother of Bo, Liu Ping (ÂäâÂπ≥), was granted part of the former Changshan as the principality of Zhending, while the remaining territories became Changshan Commandery. In late Western Han dynasty, the commandery administered 18 counties, namely Yuanshi (ÂÖÉÊ∞è), Shiyi (Áü≥ÈÇë), Sangzhong (Ê°ë‰∏≠), Lingshou (ÈùàÂ£Ω), Puwu (Ëí≤Âêæ), Shangquyang (‰∏äÊõ≤ÈôΩ), Jiumen (‰πùÈñÄ), Jingxing (‰∫ïÈôò), Fangzi (ÊàøÂ≠ê), Zhongqiu (‰∏≠‰∏ò), Fengsi (Â∞ÅÊñØ), Guan (Èóú), Pingji (Âπ≥Ê£ò), Hao (ÈÑó), Leyang (Ê®ÇÈôΩ), Pingtai (Âπ≥Ëá∫), Duxiang (ÈÉΩÈÑâ) and Nanxingtang (ÂçóË°åÂîê). The population in 2 AD was 677,956, or 141,741 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. Zhending was merged back in early Eastern Han dynasty, and the seat of the commandery was moved to Zhending County (ÁúüÂÆöÁ∏£). The commandery became the fief of imperial princes several times during the Eastern Han. In 140 AD, the population was 631,184, or 97,500 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 110. From the Jin dynasty to the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, its territory was reduced as new commanderies were formed and counties were transferred to other commanderies.

He is a three times Irish Greyhound Derby winning trainer. Profile Holland left school aged 16, to work at the Hook Estate and Kennels for Greyhound Racing Association trainer Randy Singleton, who was based at White City. He then moved to work for Jill and Gordon Holt. After a break he returned to greyhound racing on the independent circuit. In September 1992, based at the Avon Park Kennels on Ringwood Road, in St Ives, Dorset he applied for and was granted a National Greyhound Racing Club licence and gained an attachment at Portsmouth Stadium where he met his wife Nicky. His first major training feat was steering One For Tarbert through to the Wendy Fair St Leger at Wembley on 15 November 1996. He reached the 1997 Scurry Gold Cup final with Official Figure before Holland moved to Poole Stadium and became the track's champion trainer but he soon required a track that could provide regular races for his higher class of greyhound. He subsequently joined Oxford Stadium in 2000 and continued to build a strong reputation. In 2001 he then became attached to Brighton & Hove Greyhound Stadium and reached the final of the RD Racing Cesarewitch. In 2002 Graham and Nicky made the decision to moved to Golden, County Tipperary in Ireland, they set up the Riverside Kennel on a seven acre plot. The move inevitably resulted in a period of transition for the kennel and it was not until 2005 that they tasted success winning the 2005 Tipperary Cup with Broadacres Tommy. The competition wins began to regularly arrive from 2008 including the Cox Cup and Tipperary Cup (2008) and the Laurels and Select Stakes (2009). The following decade would see the kennel become the most significant in Ireland and arguably the United Kingdom, in 2012 Knockglass Billy won the Laurels and the following year Cabra Buck reached the 2013 Irish Greyhound Derby final It was during 2015 that Holland was propelled into the leading trainer in Ireland, he won the Easter Cup with Sidarian Blaze, the Oaks with Ballydoyle Honey and the Champion Stakes with Sidarian Vega. In 2016 he won Ireland's leading prize, the Boylesports Irish Greyhound Derby with Rural Hawaii. In addition Clares Rocket won the National Produce and Champion Stakes and Skywalker Manner won the Laurels. The following year (2017) resulted in a Clonbrien Hero winning three competitions; the St Leger, Produce and Laurels. Following a quiet 2018 he bounced back with a second Derby triumph when Lenson Bocko won the 2019 Irish Greyhound Derby. The year also contained major wins in the Easter Cup, Shelbourne 600, Select Stakes and the Race of Champions. Holland began 2020 with a third Easter Cup title, this time with Wolfe and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown he won a third National Produce in five years, with Newinn Taylor who won his 12th successive race. The success continued when Newinn Taylor then won the 2020 Irish Greyhound Derby winning his 16th race from 18 starts, propelling Holland on to a short list of three time Irish Derby winners behind four time winners Tom Lynch and Gay McKenna.

Once the virgin pine resource was exhausted in south Mississippi, small towns like Maxie, that depended on commerce in forest products, faded rapidly. In 2019, a church and cemetery were the only features bearing the Maxie name.

Life and career Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Blattner studied at Affton High School. He organized his first group, Jules Blattner and the Teen Tones, in 1956. Reputedly the first white rock and roll band in St. Louis, they performed regularly at high school dances and in local shows over the next few years. In 1959, Blattner recorded his first single, \\"Rock & Roll Blues\\", for the local Bobbin record label. Regarded by Bruce Eder at Allmusic as \\"a classic of late- era rockabilly\\", it reached the local charts but failed to break nationally. Blattner and his band supported stars such as Brenda Lee, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard when they did shows in the area, and he released a second single, \\"Teen Town\\", but again failed to achieve nationwide success. Biography by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 19 September 2019 Tony Wilkinson, \\"Jules Blattner\\", Black Cat Rockabilly. Retrieved 19 September 2019 In the early 1960s he recorded for the K-Ark label in Nashville, and changed the band name, first to the Twist Tones and then to the Jules Blattner Group. As resident bandleader at the Butterscotch Lounge in St Louis, he recorded his own song, \\"Butterscotch Twist\\", which was included on the compilation LP, A Musical Tour of Gaslight Square. Blattner also recorded several singles for the local Norman label, and released a version of Chuck Berry's \\"No Money Down\\" as a single on Coral Records. In 1965, he and his band recorded tracks in Chicago with Chuck Berry, which appeared on Berry's LP Chuck Berry in London. The songs included a reworking of \\"Butterscotch Twist\\", credited to Berry as \\"Butterscotch\\". Blattner and his band performed regularly in St Louis, and in Hawaii during the winter season. He also recorded for the Tee Pee label. He relocated to California, and was recruited by the USO to perform in Vietnam, where his tour in early 1968 coincided with the Tet Offensive. After returning to the US, Blattner formed a new band in Wisconsin, which eventually took the name Jules Blattner and the Warren Groovy All-Star Band, and released several further singles on local labels. In 1971, the Jules Blattner Group released an album on Buddah Records, Call Me Man!, followed by Back On The Road Again in 1972. He also recorded a concept album The Mishtabula Maine Marching Band and Soil Salvation Society, credited to Seluj Renttalb (Blattner's name spelled backwards) and issued by MGM Records. The album is described as \\"a 'Sergeant Pepper' style release, complete with folk music influences and a talking children choir, for the flower power generation\\". Other albums followed, including Back to the Basics (1979). After the commercial failure of his recordings, Blattner retired from music for several years, re-emerging in the 1980s as a live performer in the St Louis area, Florida and elsewhere. In 1992, he was voted Best Local Rock & Roll Artist in a newspaper poll, and released the album Jump On This. He retired from performing in 2003. His early recordings were reissued on several compilations of rockabilly music, and in 2004 a compilation CD of his recordings was released by the German label Hydra.

It has been argued that the Kamba attack forced the communities living in this area to unite against the enemy and that this unification led to the creation of Zaramo identity. The Zaramo are presently the largest ethnic group in the regions surrounding Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Overview Zaramo traditions state that these Swahili communities later known as Zaramo were led by a group of Shirazi rulers called Shomvi or Shomwi at the time they were attacked by the Kamba people of Kenya. Other accounts indicate that it was these communities that were known as Shomvi. The Shomvi sought the assistance of a leader known as Pazi Kilama Lukali or Pazi Kibwe Banduka who came to their aid. Subsequently, the Shomvi agreed to offer the Pazi an annual tribute as ongoing payment for his assistance.

The story goes as follows: In the Songhai areas of Niger, the revolt against the French occupation was orchestrated by Morou (or Oumarou), chief of the canton of Karma, a town on the river Niger a few miles upstream from Boubon. Karma was a meeting point for farmers, fishermen, and nomadic populations. The village had a hard time coughing up the taxes imposed on it by the French. Even the French commander L√∂ffler at the time recognized this, saying the taxes \\"are imposed with an efficiency facilitated by the proximity of the chief town - Niamey - and they are paid without the natives being able to seize any justification, if not that of force\\". Then, in 1905 Morou, (who had already had trouble with an earlier French ruler, Captain Chanoine in 1899), was falsely accused of having refused to provide food claimed for the French troops established in the region. Arrested, he had to carry a goat skin filled with water to Niamey (45 km), walking barefoot in front of the riders of the canton of Niamey. After his release, back in Karma, Morou pondered his revenge. First, he decided not to pay any taxes anymore to the French. He then had the French officer who came to ask him for an explanation assassinated. Then, being a realist, Morou consulted the neighboring villages Boubon, Sorbon Haoussa, Sakaraara, Namari-goungou, and others and managed to gather around 1200 warriors. The leaders of the allied villages began to buy horses: the great settling of accounts with the white men was thus actively prepared. Imaginative, Morou cut the telegraph line Niamey-Tera and the wire thus obtained was used to make arrows. Then, as if he had not already provoked the French enough, during the night of January 9-10th, 1906, he had the French Lieutenant Fabre -who went down towards Niamey by the river- murdered, and looted his boat. Summoned to Niamey to justify the interruption of the telegraph line, Morou refused to go. A confrontation became thus inevitable. The authorities in Niamey asked for reinforcements from Dori, Tahoua and Zinder. A column of repression of nearly 300 regular and auxiliary men took the direction of Karma on January 16, 1906, under the command of Captain Bouchez. The next morning, not far from Boubon, the French column faced the troops of Morou: 700 men (300 riders and 400 archers) hidden in the scattered thickets on the slopes of the plateau. The fight raged only briefly, as the firepower of the French troops imposed itself easily. Morou and his partisans dispersed in the direction of the Zarmaganda Plateau and Captain Bouchez torched the villages of Boubon and Karma -abandoned by their inhabitants. On March 2, 1906, Captain Bouchez set off in pursuit of the fugitives at the head of a 160-strong force. Morou and his followers were crushed in the Zarmaganda. Villages that had dared to grant hospitality to the chief were severely punished.\\"La Question Touar√®gue au Niger\\", Andr√© Salifou. Editions Karthala, 1993, page 75-76.

He was the Director of the Escuela Regional de Bellas Artes \\"Carlos Bacaflor\\" in Arequipa, Peru.  Biography  Victor was the son of Lucas Manuel Mart√≠nez (musician and vihuela teacher) and Natividad M√°laga. The early passing of his parents took him to spend part of his childhood with one of his aunts in Mollendo, the main port in the Peruvian southern coast. While in Mollendo, he started to become interested in painting and a more adventurous life which took him to Chile, where he lived for two decades. While abroad, he traveled with several theater companies with whom he traveled through Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. He earned a living as a set designer and illustrator of movie and theater posters. In 1918, he returned to Arequipa with a theater company and decided to establish himself back in his birth city. From then on, he dedicated himself completely to painting which he learned on his own. In Arequipa, Mart√≠nez M√°laga became friends with the most prominent local painters and writers. He joined the Centro Art√≠stico and won the most important awards in his field quickly becoming one of the members of Los Independientes, a new movement of independent painters in Peru. The artist also spent long periods of time living in Cusco, where he established a tight friendship with the renowned Peruvian photographer, Mart√≠n Chambi Jim√©nez. In Cusco, Mart√≠nez M√°laga also opened his first solo gallery show. He later showed his work in several solo and group exhibits in Arequipa, Puno, Lima, La Paz (Bolivia) among other cities. In 1933, he became a teacher of fine arts at the Colegio Nacional de la Independencia. In 1951, he became professor and Director at the recently opened Escuela Regional de Bellas Artes de Arequipa until he retired in 1966. Mart√≠nez M√°laga continued to paint until he died in Arequipa on November 28, 1976.  Works  Between the Peruvian artists of his generation, Mart√≠nez M√°laga stood out for his portraiture painting. \\"The human figure\\", noted the poet C√©sar Atahualpa Rodr√≠guez, \\"has in him one of its most accomplished painters.\\" Along with the portraits he was commissioned to create, V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez M√°laga created a prolific body of work in which he represented with mastery the farmers and working people from Arequipa and Cusco. His skill in the oil painting technique took him to also represent Costumbrismo scenes, and urban and rural landscapes of the cities where he lived. He was especially interested in his work in the study of the light. Several of his portraits are part of the collection owned by Galer√≠a de la Municipalidad de Arequipa and Banco Wiese, while his Costumbrismo pieces are part of private collections in Arequipa, Lima, Cusco and the United States. In 2015, el Gobierno Regional de Arequipa and Cuzzi Editores published the book Mart√≠nez M√°laga in which a vast collection of his paintings and drawings are showcased.

County Hall, which is the headquarters of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, is a Grade II listed building. History Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became necessary to find a meeting place for the East Riding County Council. Initially meetings of the county council were held in the Sessions House and in the Guildhall. After deciding the old Sessions House and Guildhall were inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected in Cross Street had been occupied by the former Mechanics Institute. A new purpose-built building, which was designed by R. G. Smith and F. S. Brodrick in the Flemish Renaissance style, was completed in 1891. The design involved a main frontage with eleven bays facing onto the Cross Street; the left hand section section of five bays, which was symmetrical, featured an elaborately carved stone doorway on the ground floor flanked by composite order columns, with three tall mullion windows on the first floor; the right hand section of six bays, which was asymmetrical, featured a porch flanked by Doric order columns and topped with a pediment containing the county coat of arms, with tall mullion windows on the first and second floors. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber which contained fine furniture carved by the wood carver and cabinet maker, James Elwell. In the 1930s the novelist, Winifred Holtby, attended council meetings in the council chamber to obtain inspiration for her book South Riding which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1936. Following the abolition of East Riding County Council in 1974, the building became the offices of Humberside County Council. A large modern office block, intended to create additional facilities for the county council, was was built on Champney Road and opened in 1983. Local government was reorganised again, with the abolition of Humberside County Council in 1996, and county hall became the offices of the new unitary authority, East Riding of Yorkshire Council at that time. The council chamber was refurbished in late 2019.

The benefit is aimed at reducing funeral poverty in Scotland by providing people who receive certain benefits or tax credits with a payment that can be used to help pay funeral costs, burial or cremation costs, travel costs, and medical costs. The amount of each payment is dependent upon which local authority the person who died resided in. If the person who died left any money or had an insurance policy, this can also impact the total amount paid.  Origin  Social Security Scotland was established in April 2018 following the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018. Social Security Scotland delivers certain areas of social security policy that was devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the Scotland Act 2016.  Funeral Support Payment  On 16 September 2019, Funeral Support Payment replaced the UK's Funeral payment in Scotland. The benefit widened the eligibility of the UK's funeral payment, allowing more people to apply for it. It also increased the flat rate of the payment to take into account inflation. For applications submitted from 1 April 2020 onwards, payments have been increased in line with inflation. The flat rate of the payment has been increased ¬£700 to ¬£1,000. The payment for those with a funeral plan will also increase from ¬£120 to ¬£122.05.  Eligibility  To be eligible for Funeral Support Payment, the person applying must be in receipt of one of the following benefits: * Universal Credit * Child Tax Credit * Working Tax Credit * Income Support * Pension Credit * Housing Benefit * Income-based Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) * Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) The person applying for the payment must also be responsible for the costs of the funeral.

Yagami is a former defense attorney who resigns after a client he successfully defended kills their partner. Three years later, Yagami is a private detective in his own and investigates a serial killer who gouges out their victims' eyes. Yagami is voiced by Takuya Kimura in Japanese and by Greg Chun in English. When developing Yagami, the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio team wanted to create a new type of main character following the release of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, which concludes the story of series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. In contrast to the Kiryu's strong, heroic presence, Yagami is meant to be a more relatable character due to his troubled life. To differentiate between the two protagonists, Yagami was given sidequests in which he becomes friends with residents of Kamurocho. Takuya Kimura was chosen to voice Yagami to appeal to a wide audience. Greg Chun, who played Yagami in English-language versions of the game, said the role was challenging but enjoyable. Critical response to Yagami has been generally positive. Video game journalists have praised the depth of Yagami's character arc and backstory in Judgment, and have favorably compared him to former protagonist Kiryu. Kimura and Chun have both been commended for their portrayals of the character. Creation and development =Personality and influences= Since the game Yakuza 6: The Song of Life concluded the story of Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio game developers wanted to create a distinctive character for the story. At the behest of producer Kazuki Hosokawa, the team decided the character should be a detective. The biggest influence was the Paul Newman film The Verdict, in which Newman's character Frank Galvin suffers a crisis similar to Yagami's in regards to his career as a lawyer. In order to a stark contrast between Kiryu and the new protagonist, the staff wanted to develop Yagami as a more relatable character, with his fall from grace and gradual redemptive arc designed to appeal to players. Due to the popularity of detective stories, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio wrote Yagami as a man who would become more knowledgeable alongside the player as the game progressed. Sega described Yagami as \\"a man of conviction who fights for his beliefs, despite the overwhelming despair surrounding him\\". Executive director and writer Toshihiro Nagoshi said the detective idea drew on multiple influences, primarily Korean films. Because there are few games based on detective dramas, Hosokawa wanted Yagami to stand out but recognized creating a new character is a major challenge. To make a protagonist who would be a fitting successor to Kiryu, Hosokawa wanted Yagami to be \\"more grounded to fit the noir vibe\\". He also said: > \\"When you‚Äôre writing a story and there‚Äôs a really solid character that‚Äôs > been around for a long time, the character dictates what happens next. In > contrast to that, with Yagami, at the start of development we didn‚Äôt really > have anything attached to him at all. It was a challenge, but also an > opportunity for a development team that has been working so long on the same > series.\\" The staff wanted the protagonist to have a deep connection to the city. To emphasize this, they introduced a gameplay mechanic known as the Friendship System, allowing Yagami to befriend and form bonds with the residents of Kamurocho. The developers used the main story to explore facets of Yagami's personality, using sidequests to please fans wanting a balance between seriousness and comedy. Hosokawa regarded the friendship system as one of his favorite parts of Judgment due to the bonds Yagami forms with other characters. As a result, Hosokawa believes that a Judgment sequel would have to remain in Kamurocho due to Yagami's strong connection with the city and its people. In contrast to previous Yakuza protagonists, who are often only visitors to Kamurocho, Yagami was written as a civilian resident in the city, allowing his social life to be further explored. Localization producer Scott Strichart said though fans might miss previous Yakuza characters, like Kiryu and Goro Majima, he hoped they would be receptive to Yagami, describing him as \\"his own person ‚Äì super smart, a razor-sharp wit, and a guy who harbours his own flaws, too\\". The relationship between Yagami and his ex-lover Mafuyu Fujii was changed during development because Nagoshi found the romance spoiled the thriller aspects of Judgment. Nagoshi also expressed doubts about the game's popularity in English-speaking countries because Takuya Kimura is not popular in Western regions. Following the release of the game, Sega staff felt that if there should be a sequel to Judgment, Yagami and his partner Masaharu Kaito would retain their lead roles and would still be set in Kamurocho. =Casting= Takuya Kimura served as a face model to Yagami as well as Japanese actor. Early in the development of Judgment, the developers considered using a famous actor to portray Yagami, deciding upon Takuya Kimura. Nagoshi was afraid audiences would accuse them of toning down the character due to Kimura's popularity. However, Kimura was open to the team's suggestions and worked with the developers to hone the character. Yagami has more spoken dialogue in Judgment than Kiryu had in any individual Yakuza game. Sega was pleased with Kimura's performance, noting he needed far fewer retakes during recording than they anticipated. Some lines were rewritten to better fit Kimura's delivery, but the writers ensured these changes would not deviate from Yagami's personality. The game's dialogue was recorded in chronological order so players would feel Kimura's voice evolving as Yagami's character develops during the story. Kimura enjoyed his work on the game, and Nagoshi remarked on Kimura's quick response to his messages. In contrast with previous Yakuza titles, the game was not recorded until after the whole scenario was written, which helped Kimura and the other actors. Yagami's character was revealed alongside the Japanese marketing of the game in September 2018. Sega stated that Kimura \\"more than 1,000 minutes of voice recording time for his lines\\". As a result, the company aimed to bring a major appeal in the protagonist. Nagoshi also expressed doubts about the game's popularity in English-speaking countries because Kimura is not popular in Western regions. The game also references other parts of Kimura's career, such as the dialogue line \\"Chotte mateyo\\" (Hey, wait a minute!), a line spoken by Kimura's character in the 1997 television drama Love Generation and Yagami's use of multiple outfits like Kimura. Based on his previous knowledge of the Yakuza franchise, Greg Chun was surprised and pleased to be selected to voice Yagami in the English-language version of Judgment. Yagami's voice was meant to make him sound like a \\"bona fide badass\\" regardless of language, something the localization team believed they succeeded at. Chun found his work on the game gratifying, saying, \\"it really did require me to let go of the tricks that you use to push a performance through, and I really did need to fall back on authenticity and genuine groundedness\\". Chun found staying faithful to the spirit of the Japanese version challenging, but enjoyed portraying Yagami's blend of seriousness and comedy. He said having to scream in certain parts of the game was difficult. Chun was surprised by the depth of Yagami's character arc, considering his work on the game an unforgettable experience. He found the character easy to connect with because of his realistic characterization. =Fighting style= Yagami's fighting style was inspired by Chinese martial arts. Ryu ga Gokotoku Studios developed multiple techniques for Yagami. While the team had experience thanks to the main Yakuza game, they felt that Yagami should have own new unique moves. This was provided by the fact that Judgment is noir game and thus were restricted to techniques that fit the genre. This was balanced by giving Yagami his own detective skills not present in any of their previous works. Nagoshi wanted to make Yagami's moves entertaining in order to make the player relief stress from the dark narrative but did not want him to use over-the-top fighting techniques. Yagami was given the Parkour moves like the wall kick with the intention of making the character being easy to control. Yagami's fighting style was inspired by Asian movies with a stylishness based on Kung Fu style and Parkour moves at the same time. In order to fit the actor behind the character, Nagoshi claimed that he drew parallels from Power Rangers-like characters. This further made Nagoshi felt Yagami's character would be fitting to Kimura. In the original Japanese version of the game, Yagami's fighting styles are known as and stances. Sega changed them for the Western release to crane-style and tiger-style stances since they found order to these two words more common for English speakers. Plot summary Born in 1983, Takayuki Yagami is orphaned as a teenager after his attorney father proves an accused murderer innocent, leading the victim's father to kill his parents in retribution. Yagami moves to Kamurocho, where he is taken in and raised by yakuza patriarch Mitsugu Matsugane. Matsugane's friend Ryuzo Genda takes an interest in Yagami, paying his law school tuition and later hiring him to work at his law firm. Yagami develops a romantic relationship with prosecutor Mafuyu Fujii, and gains widespread recognition in 2015 after proving Advanced Drug Development Center (ADDC) janitor Shinpei Okubo innocent of murdering patient Koichi Waku. Shortly thereafter, Okubo is arrested for killing his girlfriend Emi Terasawa and burning down his apartment. As a result, Yagami breaks up with Fujii and gives up practicing law. Three years later, at the beginning of Judgment, Yagami has become a private detective, working alongside former Matsugane family yakuza Masaharu Kaito. While helping prove Matsugane captain Kyohei Hamura innocent of murder, Yagami becomes interested in a serial murder case in which the victims' eyes are removed from the bodies. Dubbing the killer \\"The Mole\\", Yagami and Kaito begin investigating the case with help from Fujii, Genda, and several others. After the Mole kills Yagami's former colleague Masamichi Shintani, Yagami discovers ties between the Mole and ADDC doctor Yoji Shono. Yagami meets Shigeru Kajihira, who reveals a failed plan to take over the area around the ADDC for a land redevelopment program that was foiled when researchers claimed to have found a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease named \\"AD-9\\". Kajihira asks Yagami to investigate the death of former ADDC vice-director Toru Hashiki. While police detective Mitsuru Kuroiwa accuses fellow detective Kazuya Ayabe of being the Mole, Yagami theorizes the real culprit is conducting human experiments to test the effectiveness of AD-9 and that the deaths of Waku, Shintani and Hashiki were failed experiments. He also suspects Shono killed Terasawa to cover up the experiments. After Matsugane is killed defending them both from the Mole, Hamura tells Yagami that Kuroiwa is the Mole and provides Yagami with evidence of the ADDC's connection to Shintani's murder. Yagami successfully defends Ayabe in court and proves the ADDC's involvement in the murders. During the trial, Yagami learns Kuroiwa has escaped and pursues him to the ADDC. Yagami defeats Kuroiwa, who is shot by the police, while Shono dies of side effects from an AD-9 injection. The court frees Okubo and places the others involved in the conspiracy under arrest. In the aftermath, Yagami declines to take up law again and continues to work with Kaito at the Yagami Detective Agency. Reception Critical response to Takayuki Yagami has been generally positive. Upon his revealtion before the game's release, RPGSite found his moves more entertaining than previous Yakuza leads, citing them as \\"Not only is Yagami more agile and lithe than the characters introduced through the Yakuza series, his style is arguably flashier and more acrobatic.\\" IGN India and Entertainment Focus enjoyed the character's personality and depth provided by his role in the story. Engadget called him a \\"flawed but lovable hero\\" for his sense of honor, comparing him to detectives in television dramas. RPGamer called Yagami a likable hero and considered his character arc the best part of the game, something which IGN agreed with. His dynamic with Kaito was praised by GameSpot and Siliconera due to the duo's likable chemistry. Upon first seeing him, VideoGamer stated that despite Yagami does not look like a classic sleuth, he sounds like one due to his narration when the video game starts, proving potential for an entertaining hero with his martial arts providing more entertainment. He further compares him with the detective Philip Marlowe from the novel The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. Several outlets compared and contrasted Yagami with Kazuma Kiryu. EGM Now found the differences between Yagami's upbeat attitude and Kiryu's stoic nature to be interesting. GameInformer noted Yagami has no similarities with Kiryu and considered him a more relatable character. Kotaku called Yagami a more realistic character than Kiryu because of the way his story is portrayed. GamesRadar considered Yagami's character one of the biggest differences between Judgment and the Yakuza games, highlighting Yagami's different worldview; the reviewer praised Yagami because he stands out both physically and mentally. GameRevolution considered Yagami more complex than Kiryu due to his ability to show weakness. GameSpot considered it challenging to see Yagami as a true successor to Kiryu's legacy but liked the narrative presented through the character, comparing him to fellow Yakuza character Shun Akiyama. Another IGN writer compared Yagami's fighting styles instead to the works of Jackie Chan. Despite fearing Yagami might seem similar to Kiryu, Polygon said Yagami's interactions with secondary characters give him an identity of his own. USGamer and HobbyConsolas were more critical, saying Yagami is not as appealing as his predecessor and that his backstory is similar to Kiryu's. Following the worldwide success of Judgment, PushSquare and GamesRadar said they would enjoy to see Yagami return in a sequel, with GamesRadar finding him as a fitting successor to Kiryu. Due to their similar jobs, Yagami has often been compared to Phoenix Wright, the main character from Capcom's Ace Attorney series. Similarly, GameRant listed him as one of the best cops in gaming based on parallels with Phoenix Wright due to his previous job as he turns into a detective instead. Journalists also commented on the vocal performances of Yagami's two voice actors. RPGamer gave Judgment its Editors' Choice Award for Best Voice Acting, praising both Kimura and Chun's performances as Yagami. VG247 noted Kimura's appeal to female Japanese fans based on his portrayal of the character, while USGamer said Kimura's performance was one of the strongest influences on Yagami's character. Kotaku said Kimura's similarities with Yagami make the detective popular in Eastern regions for similar reasons. Chun's performance as Yagami was praised by The Hollywood Reporter and Game Informer. EGM Now believed Chun's performance was more striking than Kimura's, who the writer did not find suitable for the character. In the 2020 NAVGTR Awards, Kimura was nominated for the \\"Performance in a Drama, Lead\\" award for his work as Yagami, but lost to Charlotte McBurney's Amicia from A Plague Tale: Innocence.

The work was commissioned by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra and was completed on February 2, 2017. It received its world premiere on November 16, 2018, by the St. Louis Symphony and their principal bassoonist Andrew Cuneo under the conductor Cristian MƒÉcelaru in Powell Hall, St. Louis. Composition The composition has a duration of approximately 20 minutes and is cast in the traditional three-movement (fast-slow-fast) concerto form. In the score program note, the composer state that the work \\"is meant in large part simply to provide pleasure. I realize that such an intent is now looked upon with suspicion is some quarters, but I have never felt that every work of art is required to plumb the depths and secrets of human existence. Sometimes twenty minutes spent in the company of, I hope, a genial companion can be the most meaningful way of passing time.\\" He added, \\"I did, however, try to resist making too much of the bassoon's oft-heralded role as the 'clown' of the orchestra. While there are occasional forays into the more 'comical' lower range of the instrument, more time is spent in the middle and upper tessitura of the bassoon, and melodic lines often tend toward the lyrical. Overall there is a collegial relationship between soloist and orchestra, unlike the common 'soloist against the orchestra' paradigm of many romantic era concerti.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo bassoon and a small orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two additional bassoons (\\"in order to provide the occasional potential for building a sort of 'mega-bassoon'\\"), two horns, timpani, one percussionist, harp, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Sarah Bryan Miller of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the performance as \\"a resounding success\\" and wrote, \\"The composer rang all the changes in mood and style, but kept things accessible. The concerto started out playfully, moved into mystery, explored some jagged rhythms; there were dialogues with those other bassoons, with the winds, the harp and other instruments, for an engaging whole.\\" References Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:2017 compositions Rouse Category:Music commissioned by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the St. Louis Symphony Category:Music commissioned by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Bassoon Concerto (Rouse)"},{"id":"61855961","text":"Lygodactylus tsavoensis, the Tsavo dwarf gecko, is a species of gecko endemic to Kenya.

Retrieved 22 September 2019 was a German boxer who was the heavyweight champion of Germany and Europe in the 1930s. Career Born in Berlin the son of businessman Otto K√∂lblin and Hedwig K√∂lblin (n√©e Richter),Kliemann, Horst (1956) Who's Who in Germany, Volume 1, Intercontinental Book and Publishing Company, p. 643 K√∂lblin turned professional shortly after leaving school. He made his debut on 12 March 1931 with a points win over Hans Bischoff. In July that year he stopped former German heavyweight champion Ludwig Haymann in the seventh round. These were the only two wins from his first seven fights. The mixed results continued into 1934, K√∂lblin suffering losses to Vincenz Hower, Motzi Spakow, but three straight wins between June and October that year, including a win over Hans Sch√∂nrath led to a German heavyweight title fight against Hower, the defending champion winning comfortably on points. After a run of eight fights in which he only lost once (to Adolf Heuser), he challenged Hower in August 1936 for the German heavyweight title; K√∂lblin knocked Hower out in the tenth round to become German champion. He successfully defended the title against Werner Selle and Erwin Klein, and in March 1937 challenged Pierre Charles for the IBU European heavyweight title at the Deutschlandhalle, Charlottenburg. K√∂lblin won on points to add the European title to his German title. He successfully defended his German title against Hower in May 1937, but after losing to Eddie Phillips in a non-title fight in November 1937, lost the European title in March 1938 to Heinz Lazek after being disqualified in the second round at the Sportpalast in Schoeneberg for repeated low blows. In November 1938, he also lost the German title, losing on points to Walter Neusel. In August 1939 he was set to fight Tommy Farr in Wales, but with tensions growing between the UK and Germany, the Welsh branch of the British Boxing Board of Control refused to recommend that the Ministry of Labour give him a permit to fight, prompting criticism from the German press, who saw it as a political decision. He beat Lazek in November 1939, and June 1940 challenged Neusel in an attempt to regain the German title, but Neusel again won on points. K√∂lblin was out of the ring after November 1942 due to World War II, but returned to boxing after the war, winning eight of his ten post-war fights, but losing two, including an unsuccessful challenge for Hein ten Hoff's German title. His final fight was a fourth-round knockout of Heinz Klose in May 1950. He retired with a record of 50 wins from 78 fights, with 20 losses and 8 draws. In the early 1950s, K√∂lblin worked as a coach in the German Democratic Republic. In 1956 he fled to West Germany, where he continued to work as a boxing trainer and later a manager. K√∂lblin died on 19 December 1998, at the age of 87.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The building, which dates back to 1320, was acquired from a householder, Edward Mynskyp, for use as a meeting place by the town officials in 1501. It was remodelled internally by William Middleton in 1762. It was remodelled again, both internally and externally in 1832, when the original arched entrance was removed and a large portico with four Doric order columns and a pediment above, designed by Charles Mountain the Younger, was installed on the front of the building. The courtroom, located on the ground floor on the south side of the building, features a Rococo-style stucco ceiling, created by the stuccoist, Giuseppe Cortese (1704-1779), which was installed at the time of the remodelling by Middleton. The courtroom was used as the sole facility for dispensing justice in the town until the Sessions House at New Walk opened in 1814. At that time the quarter sessions moved to the new Sessions House, but the magistrates' courts continued to be held in the guildhall. In 1827, a public gallery was created in the courtroom using two Doric order columns which had been designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor for the galleries of Beverley Minster and which had been removed from the minister the previous year. Also created by Middleton, as part of the remodelling, was the magistrates room, located on the first floor on the north side of the building: this functioned as the council chamber for the Borough of Beverley until 1832 when the mayor's parlour was created. The mayor's parlour, located on the first floor at the front of the building, was used as a council chamber for the Borough of Beverley from 1832 until council meetings moved to the courtroom in 1896. Although council offices were established at Lairgate in 1911, council meetings including the annual mayor choosing ceremony continued to be held at the guildhall. In the late 19th century, along with the Sessions House, the guildhall was also used as the meeting place for the East Riding County Council until County Hall was completed in 1891. The guildhall also ceased to be the local seat of government for the town when the new unitary authority, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, was formed in 1996. The guildhall now operates as a community museum which exhibits objects from Beverley's history.

In September 2019, he won a bronze medal at the Paralympic World Swimming Championship in London. He has also won a silver at the Mediterranean Games of Mersin in 2013 and two bronze medals at the European Championships in Funchal in 2016.  Career  Since birth, Ciulli has suffered from both a case cerebral palsy that caused him a mild half-paresis on the right side of his body and from perineuroma which is located on his right sciatic nerve. In 2012, he was introduced to the Paralympic organization and entering the world of Paralympic swimming by participating at the Italian Paralympic Swimming Championships in Pietralata, with Po.Ha.Fi. team. There, he was first classified as an S10, SM10 and SB9. At that meet, he broke two Italian records in the 50 and 100 freestyle. In 2013, he was invited for the first time to join the Italian national Paralympic swimming team and competed for the red, white and green at his first international meet in Berlin. A few months later, he was invited, together with the paralympic champion Federico Morlacchi, to compete at the XVII Mediterranean Games, in Mersin Turkey, where he won the silver medal in the 100 freestyle with a time of 57 \\"14. That same year he was selected by the National Team to take part in the FINA World Cup for able- bodied swimmers in Eindhoven. There he won three gold medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle and in the 100 IM. At that same event, he competed together with able-bodied athletes from the Italian National Swimming Team including, Gregorio Paltrinieri, Fabio Scozzoli, Ilaria Bianchi and Federico Turrini. In August 2014 at the European Paralympic Swimming Championships in Eindhoven, he broke the Italian S10 long course national record with a time of 25\\"18, while placing forth in the event. In Eindhoven, he also set the Italian S10 national backstroke record in the 4x100 mixed relay with a time of 1'04\\"69. In 2015, he once again was invited to join the National swim team to compete in an international meet in Berlin where he established two new Italian national S10 records in the 100 freestyle with a time of 56\\"35 and in the 100 butterfly, with a time of 1'00\\"88. These times were just a few tenths of a second away for the qualifying time for 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. In 2016 at the European Championships in Funchal he won two bronze medals. One in the 50 freestyle with a time of 25\\"40 and the other in the 4x100 mixed relay. In 2017 at the Italian Winter Paralympic Swimming Championships held in Portici, he became the first Italian Paralympic athlete to swim the 50 freestyle under 25 seconds (24\\"89) and the 100 freestyle under 55 seconds (54\\"77), also establishing the new national short course records. At the 2019 World Series in Lignano, he was reclassified as a S9, SM9 SB8 swimmer because the tumor located on his right sciatic nerve grew and progressively hampered the functionality of his lower right leg. In September 2019, he represented Italy at the World Paralympic Swimming Championships in London, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 metres freestyle with a time of 26‚Äù04 and he became World Champion with the National Team of Italy  Extra-competitive activities  In 2011 he graduated with a master's degree in Law and subsequently, in 2015 passed the Bar exam to earn his license to practice. He has elected to not pursue his law career until he retires from competitive swimming. Concurrently in 2015, he obtain a number of state certifications to expand his expertise in swimming and water safety. His certifications include, life guard, second level triathlon trainer, water polo instructor, various fitness instructor, swim school coordinator, as well as sports and facilities management. Since 2010, he has also been the head coach Klab Nuoto Master Swim Team in Florence, Italy. He has built the program from scratch currently counts over 100 athletes: as of 2019, Klab Nuoto Masters has won six consecutive Italian Master Swimming Championships U.I.S.P. Additionally, since 2016 he has been the personal trainer of Noura Mana, who is a member of the Moroccan National Swimming Team and who participated in the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Under Ciulli's guidance, she has broken two Moroccan national records, in the 50 freestyle (25 and 50 metres). She has won a bronze medal at the 2019 Pan-African Games in Casablanca and has also participated at the World Short Course Championships in 2018 in Hangzhou.

ChemRisk founder and former president, Dennis Paustenbach, \\"has long been an expert witness and top consultant\\" to \\"scores of companies in the chemical, energy and medical products industries\\" facing lawsuits over products or environmental practices or product safety. Their clients included San Francisco-based utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E;) and BP. ChemRisk uses toxicology and risk assessment to measure the hazards of chemicals in soil, air, water, food, sediments and consumer products. Paustenbach and his firm have \\"drawn the scrutiny of investigative journalists.\\" Background Paustenbach, who earned his PhD in environmental toxicology from Purdue University in 1982, created ChemRisk in 1985, with its headquarters in San Francisco, as an environmental consulting firm. Using assessments models regarding health risk, ChemRisk quantified risks of chemicals in \\"foods, water, air, sediment, soil, and consumer products\\". He worked at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis for two years before taking a masters in industrial hygiene. The new field of risk assessment was emerging in 1982, which integrated environmental toxicology and industrial hygiene. While working for Stauffer Chemical in Connecticut in the early 1980s, he \\"gained expertise in how chemicals were regulated\\" as he interacted with federal agencies through his job. He then worked for Syntex Pharmaceuticals in California's Silicon Valley. For three years Paustenbach worked on a project related to hexachlorophene, and dioxin which is its toxic byproduct. where Hexachlorophene had previously been manufactured at a production facility in Times Beach, Missouri. \\"Large amounts of dioxin, a toxic byproduct of hexachlorophene, had been accidentally mixed with motor oil and sprayed on roads and land throughout the town, creating a huge liability as it became the country's most visible toxic waste site and forcing the town's entire population to re-settle elsewhere.\\" His 1986 Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology co-authored article, \\"A Critical Examination of Assumptions Used in Risk Assessments of Dioxin Contaminated Soil\\"According to the February 18, 2016 article \\"Brokers of junk science?\\" which is part of their 2016 series entitled Science for Sale the Center for Public Integrity (CPI), critics also claim that Critical Reviews in Toxicology and Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology are \\"purveyors of junk science. CPI said they published \\"misleading, industry-backed articles that threaten public health by playing down the dangers of well-known toxic substances such as lead and asbestos. The articles often are used to stall regulatory efforts and defend court cases.\\" was written in response to the Times Beach, Missouri crisis. In it the authors concluded that there were \\"flaws and shortcomings\\" in the original Times Beach risk assessment. Paustenbach noted that since 1984 studies had replaced previously held assumptions with new \\"quantitative evidence\\" about the estimation of exposures to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, more commonly known as dioxins. The article found flaws in the EPA studies and concluded that much higher levels of dioxins were \\"acceptable for residential and nonresidential areas.\\" ChemRisk cited this article in their September 5, 1990 report commissioned by Hercules Inc. In the early 1990s, ChemRisk operated as a division of the environmental engineering and consulting firm Rancho Cordova-based McLaren/Hart Environmental Engineering. Paustenbach was appointed as McLaren/Hart President and CEO in 1993. By 1998, McLaren/Hart‚Äîwhich operated from 1977 to 2000‚Äîhad become the 11th largest environmental engineering firm in the area.ChemRisk.

ChemRisk (a division of McLaren/Hart), Alameda, CA 1994 Prepared for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Paustenbach moved ChemRisk to Exponent from 1998 to 2003. In \\"mid- to-late 2003\\", he re-established ChemRisk. At that time some of operations that had been handled by Exponent were moved to the newly re-formed ChemRisk. In his August 1, 2018 article in New Solutions: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy, David Egilman said that the role of scientific consulting firms such as ChemRisk and Exponent, was litigation. These firms use \\"dose-reconstruction studies and policy arguments\\" in legal defenses using \\"multidisciplinary\\" teams that they include \\"scientists, physicians, engineers, and regulatory consultants\\". ChemRisk has described its role as one in which its \\"scientists and engineers\\" served as \\"technical advisors to lawyers in all aspects of environmental, occupational, toxic tort, and product liability litigation, including technical strategy development, providing scientific advice, expert testimony, selection and preparation of expert witnesses, assistance in cross-examining opponent's expert witnesses.\\" In his presentation to the March 1, 2007 Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing Examining Asbestos, Focusing on Efforts to Better Protect the Health of American Workers and their Families entitled \\"Asbestos: Still Lethal/Still Legal\\", veteran environmental consultant Barry Castleman, whose PhD was on asbestos, described how ChemRisk \\"seeded literature\\" on asbestos. He drew attention to the $120 million a year worth of asbestos brake linings and brake shoes\\" imported into the United States from \\"countries such as Brazil, China, Colombia, and Mexico, that use a lot of asbestos. Castleman said that by 2007, annually there were 10,000 Americans that died from the way asbestos was used in the past. Since 1972 Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) standards have required warning labels on brake and clutch parts made with asbestos. Ford Motor Company began to use them in 1980; Chrysler in 1984. General Motors had not documented when it started to use labels warning consumers of their brake parts about asbestos. OSHA never cited \\"any seller of these unlabeled products for violation of the standard.\\" On July 26, 2006 OSHA posted a factsheet by industrial hygienist Ira Wainless on its website which explained the \\"mandatory appendix\\" of the 1994 OSHA \\"asbestos standard applicable to mechanics doing brake and clutch repair. Former OSHA chief John Henshaw, whose daughter Shannon Henshaw Gaffney had been hired by ChemRisk after she \\"obtained her doctorate in environmental science in 2004\\" was also listed as a \\"teaming partner\\" at ChemRisk in early 2005. John Henshaw had acted as an expert witness for a leading defendant, Honeywell International in their Bendix brakes lawsuit in 2004. Soon after Wainless' factsheet was posted, Henshaw contacted his former subordinates at OSHA urged his \\"former subordinates at OSHA to retract the factsheet and possibly redo it with additional references\\". On November 6, 2006, OSHA threatened to suspend Wainless for not including articles that had been \\"commissioned jointly by General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler, starting in 2001\\". Castleman said that \\"Shannon Henshaw Gaffney's services [had] appeared 21 times on Chemrisk asbestos litigation bills to the Big Three in 2004, totaling around $10,000.\\" The Baltimore Sun reported that the OSHA brakes warning \\"survived the challenge.\\" Castleman described how ChemRisk and Exponent provided litigation services as a \\"key\\" part of the defense strategy used by General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler. Castleman said that Exponent and Chemrisk authors' work has \\"technical shortcomings, such as selectivity in what was included in these reviews and what was not.\\" He said their work was \\"solicited for the purpose of fighting personal injury claims brought by mechanics and their family members\\" as part of a \\"strategy of corporate defense lawyers, approaching and generously supporting the scientist-authors, most of whom had previously published little or nothing on asbestos. These publications were created to provide evidence that mechanics' asbestos exposures do not cause asbestos diseases. They were to be published by the best scientists money could buy.\\" Merger with Cardno By 2012, when Cardno, an \\"Australian infrastructure services group\\" acquired ChemRisk for US$33 million, the firm had a staff of 95 with expertise \\"across toxicology, industrial hygiene, epidemiology, ecotoxicology, environmental sciences, medicine, engineering, statistical analysis and risk assessment.\\" Their client base then included \\"Johnson & Johnson, John Crane Group, Ford Motor Company and Union Carbide. Cardno would expand their consulting services to include \\"occupational health and safety, product sustainability, consumer product safety and contaminated site evaluations.\\" Core expertise By 2014, over two-thirds of Cadrno ChemRisk LLC contracts involved litigation while the rest were related to general consulting. Focus areas of expertise included \\"dioxin, asbestos, lead, Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), chromium, benzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), beryllium, cobalt, diacetyl, rubber particles, nanoparticles, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and phthalates, Volatile organic compound (VOCs) & diesel exhaust, mercury, glycol ethers.\\" Researchers Along with Dennis J. Paustenbach, prominent CardnoChemRisk researchers include Kara A. Keeton, Meghan E. Glynn, Shannon H. Gaffney, Stacey M. Benson, Peter Ruestow, Rachel M. Novick, and Gary M. Marsh. Clients When Cadrno merged with ChemRisk in 2012, clients included \\"Johnson & Johnson, John Crane Group, Ford Motor Company and Union Carbide. ChemRisk played a key role in the litigation defending their clients in cases that were followed extensively by the media. This included Pacific Gas and Electric Company in relation to 1993 lawsuit by the town of Hinkley regarding the Hexavalent chromium (Chromium-6) contamination of the groundwater, BP in relation to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill,ChemRisk LLC, Study by Leading Scientific Consulting Firm Finds No Evidence of Health Dangers for Gulf Coast Cleanup Workers, CISION (Sept. 2, 2011, 4:04 PM) and DuPont who hired ChemRick to environmental chemist Wilma Subra's findings that the 2005 flooding of the Dupont DeLisle Plant by 2005 Hurricane Katrina had released toxins that were harmful to human health. Hercules Incorporated The contract with Hercules was the first major contract for Paustenbach and ChemRick. Paustenbach's 1986 paper had found flaws in the original Times Beach, Missouri risk assessment. Paustenbach noted that since 1984 studies had replaced previously held assumptions with new \\"quantitative evidence\\" about the estimation of exposures to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, more commonly known as dioxins. ChemRisk cited this article in their September 5, 1990 report commissioned by Hercules Inc. Hercules was one of several chemical companies that had, from 1964 to 1968, manufactured and sold a \\"specific phenoxy herbicide, code named Agent Orange\\" at the request of the Department of Defense. Hercules was one of the nine nine manufacturers of Agent Orange that were sued by Vietnam veterans and their families starting in the 1970s. Litigation, which was consolidated into the 1980 \\"Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation said that the \\"veterans' exposure to dioxin, a toxic by product found in Agent Orange and believed by many to be hazardous, had caused various health problems.\\" While the chemical companies involved said that based on recent scientific research, there was no link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems. Seven of the chemical companies settled the class-action suit on May 7, 1984 out of court; they would compensate the veterans $180 million if they agreed to drop all claims against them. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment In 1990, ChemRisk was hired by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to prepare Phase 1 (1990‚Äì1994) of the nine-year long Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposures Studies arising from the radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant. The Rocky Flats Plant located south of Boulder, Colorado was originally managed by Dow Chemical Company, then transferred to Rockwell in 1975. At that time, ChemRisk was a division of McLaren/Hart, a large environmental engineering and consulting firm. Pacific Gas & Electric chromium-6 pollution In 1993, 650 residents of Hinkley, California, located 120 miles northeast of Los Angeles, filed a lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;)‚Äîa San Francisco-based utility‚Äîaccusing PG&E; of contaminating the town's groundwater with chromium-6‚Äîcausing a host of ailments, from various types of cancer to severe digestive disorders. From 1952 to 1966 PG&E; dumped \\"roughly 370 million gallons of chromium-tainted wastewater\\" into unlined wastewater spreading pond around Hinkley. \\"Chromium 6 is one of the cheapest and most efficient commercially available corrosion inhibitors and was used by PG&E; in their compressor stations.\\" In 1996, \\"after arbitrators awarded $130.5 million in the first 39 cases, PG&E; decided to settle for a whopping $333 million\\"‚Äî the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history. In 2000, the lawsuit became an international cause c√©l√®bre, when Erin Brockovich, the blockbuster movie was released. However the chromium remained and by 2013, the plume was \\"more than six miles long and two miles wide and gradually expanding.\\" In 1987 the Chinese scientist‚ÄîJian Dong Zhang published a paper reporting \\"significant association between chromium pollution of drinking water and higher rates of stomach cancer in villages in rural northeast China.\\" PG&E; hired ChemRisk as scientific consultants to disprove the allegations. ChemRisk purchased Zhang's original data, distorted the findings, rewrote the paper and published it in April 1997 Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (JOEM)‚Äîthe official publication of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine‚Äîas a retraction of Zhang's 1987 paper. It was published under Zhang's name‚Äîwho was then a retired Chinese government health officer, in spite of his written objection‚Äîand a second Chinese scientist, Shu Kun Li. The fake 1997 JOEM article had lasting consequences for drinking water regulation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency cited the article when it allowed continued use of chromium in a wood preservative. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry discounted chromium-6 as an oral carcinogen because of this article. In 1996 Paustenbach and Steven Patierno were co- authors of a highly-influential article arguing that chromium 6 is not genotoxic. \\"One of PG&E;'s key experts was Steven Patierno, a former professor of pharmacology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences who had conducted numerous studies on the metal. Patierno, now the deputy director of the Duke Cancer Institute, has been an expert defense witness in seven chromium lawsuits. He hasn't wavered in his view that drinking low doses of chromium (VI) does not cause cancer.\\" In 2006 JOEM undertook a six-month internal review of the 1997 retraction. By the time JOEM undertook their investigation, Zhang had already died but the second author agreed the paper should be retracted when JOEM. According to an 2005 article by Peter Waldman in The Wall Street Journal, ChemRisk had authored the article as consultants for PG&E; who were \\"being sued for alleged chromium pollution.\\"article ID SB113530126572230084 In 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported on the influential role ChemRisk had played in changing the narrative about chromium by authoring the article as consultants for PG&E.; In addition to ChemRisk, Paustenbach later worked with Exponent; Paustenbach and ChemRisk have \\"drawn the scrutiny of investigative journalists.\\" Since 1995 he Environmental Protection Agency and California's EPA concluded that drinking chromium causes cancer but they faced powerful opposition from the chemical industry in making its ruling official. Since 1995 John Morgan who works for the California Department of Public Health, has worked to debunk allegations that chromium pollution caused a cluster of cancer cluster in the Hinkley area. In 2013 the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) found glaring weaknesses in Morgan's analysis that challenge the validity of his findings. \\"In his first study, he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in Hinkley. In his latest analysis, he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination.\\" The year long investigation by CPI, Toxic Clout, produced in partnership with the PBS NewsHour, \\"unmasked the deep, sometimes hidden, connections entangling the chemical industry, scientists and regulators, revealing the industry's sway and the public's peril.\\" In 2013 California Environmental Protection Agency finally ruled that \\"drinking hexavalent chromium, the rust inhibitor that PG&E; dumped in Hinkley, can cause cancer.\\" GM, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler Between 2001 and 2016, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and DaimlerChrysler spent about $23 million for the \\"consulting and publishing services of Exponent and Chemrisk, and scientists including Dennis Paustenbach, Michael Goodman, David Garabrant, Mary Jane Teta, Patrick Hessel, Patrick Sheehan, Elizabeth Lu, Gregory Brorby, and Brent Finley. DuPont Dupont hired ChemRisk‚Äîan \\"industry risk assessor\\"‚Äîto quantify the amount of C8 that had been released from Dupont's Parkersburg, West Virginia-based Washington Works plant between 1951 and 2003. ChemRisk's 2004 report said that the over 1.7 million pounds of perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as C8‚Äîwhich was used to produce Teflon‚Äîhad been \\"dumped, poured and released\\" into the environment. In 2005 DuPont hired ChemRisk's Houston, Texas branch of the \\"environment and health consulting firm\\" to review the work of environmental chemist Wilma Subra. They challenged Subra's findings, whose work showed that heavy metals and other pollutants that had accumulated over time at the DuPont DeLisle Plant were stirred up when the facility was flooded by Hurricane Katrina. ChemRisk researcher Mark Harris argued that the toxicants such as arsenic that Subra found in soil samples, did not pose a health risk. Subra found higher levels of dioxin and chromium levels in sediment samples from the facility. ATSDR found that in 2004, \\"DuPont DeLisle‚Äôs titanium dioxide plant reported the third highest amount of dioxin-like compounds in EPA‚Äôs Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). In 2005, the Hurricane Katrina storm surge flooded significant portions of the plant.\\" However, there was no threat to human health. By 2005, almost 2000 people had sued DuPont claiming dioxin emissions from Dupont Delisle Plant in Mississippi, had caused cancers. In August 2005, Glen Strong, an oyster fisherman with the rare blood cancer multiple myeloma, was awarded $14 million from DuPont, but the ruling was overturned June 5, 2008, by a Mississippi jury who found DuPont's plant had no connection to Mr. Strong's disease. DuPont's DeLisle plant is one of three titanium dioxide facilities produce the most dioxins in the United States, according to the US EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. DuPont maintains its operations are safe and environmentally responsible. BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill In September 2011 ChemRisk published an article entitled \\"Study by Leading Scientific Consulting Firm Finds No Evidence of Health Dangers for Gulf Coast Cleanup Workers\\" in the journal Environmental Science and Technology concluding that off-shore workers who cleaned up BP's oil between April and October 2010 found that exposure to \\"airborne benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) fell well below the Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\\" In 2013 Cherri Foytlin and her colleague, Karen Savage authored article about ChemRisk in Huffington Post. Faced with accusations that Paustenbacn and ChemRisk had \\"slanted scientific findings to suit its clients\\"‚ÄîChemRisk launched a libel suit against Cherri Foytlin and her colleague, Karen Savage who had co-authored an article about ChemRisk in Huffington Post. The case was thrown out of a New York court so ChemRisk launched another libel suit in Massachusetts. When ChemRisk attempted to withdraw the suit, Foytlin and Savage filed that ChemRisk \\"filing, Ms. Foytlin and Ms. Savage argued that ChemRisk, a unit of Cardno ChemRisk, should not be allowed simply to withdraw its lawsuit. Instead, they say the company should pay their lawyers, who have represented them on a pro bono basis, and issue an apology for dragging them through years of litigation.\\" In their article, Foytlin and Savage \\"raised questions about a 2011 ChemRisk study that found no link between chemicals released during the 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, and health problems reported by cleanup workers.\\" They claimed that \\"ChemRisk has a long, and on at least one occasion fraudulent, history of defending big polluters, using questionable ethics to help their clients avoid legal responsibility for their actions.\\" ChemRisk filed a lawsuit against Cherri Foytlin and Karen Savage, the two environmental activists whose article \\"ChemRisk, BP and Purple Strategies: A Tangled Web of Not-So-Independent Science\\" was posted on the Huffington Post site. ChemRisk lost the case based on Massachusetts Anti-SLAPP Statute‚Äî\\"legislation that provides a special motion to dismiss lawsuits designed to chill public participation in government.\\" Johnson & Johnson As reported by the St. Louis Record, in the lawsuit before the St. Louis City Circuit Court, 22 women sued Johnson & Johnson saying that J&J; baby powder had caused their ovarian cancers. Mark Lanier, the attorney for the plaintiffs challenged a witness for Johnson & Johnson‚ÄîChemRisk's Dana Hollins, a \\"board certified industrial hygienist\\". Hollins said that studies by an expert witness for the plaintiffs‚ÄîDr. David Egilman‚Äîwere \\"flawed\\". Egilman said that \\"960 studies showed the presence of asbestos in J&J; talc powder out of 1,400 studies conducted.\\" Morton Dubin, J&J;'s attorney said that Egilman had \\"inflated his exposure calculations\\". Hollins said that Egilman had not performed \\"his analysis scientifically on sound data.\\" Lanier said that Hollins who has a master's degree in public health and who was introduced as a scientist‚Äîan \\"industrial hygienist as in epidemiologist\\" was much less qualified to speak on the issue of asbestos exposure than witnesses for the plaintiffs such as Egilman and Jacqueline Moline, who is the director of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Committee. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science Magazine, Egilman's contribution to the trial was \\"decisive\\". He interviewed the women regarding how often they applied the talc. With his student researchers, they also thoroughly examined \\"thousands of pages of internal J&J; documents unearthed during the litigation\\" revealing that \\"J&J; found no asbestos in the talc because its tests were not sensitive enough\\". Egilman compared this to \\"trying to weigh a needle on a bathroom scale.\\" The jury awarded the \\"16 surviving women and the families of the six who had died\\" with $4.69 billion‚Äîthe \\"largest award in Missouri's history.\\" By 2019, John & Jonson faced over 14,000 lawsuits \\"alleging their talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer in women.\\" Johnson & Johnson deny the claims.

There is no existing mass transit but there is an existing proposal for a Cebu Bus Rapid Transit System and Cebu Light Rail Transit System. Public transport =Regulations= The public transportation system is regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board which is responsible for promulgating, administering, enforcing, and monitoring compliance of policies, laws, and regulations of public land transportation services. Road transport =Jeepneys and modern jeepneys= Just like any other place in the Philippines, jeepney is the most popular means of public transportation in the city. Modern jeepneys have also started plying the roads of the city namely Beep operated by Persano Corp. and PeoplesJeep operated by Cebu People's Multi-Purpose Cooperative. Beep has 40 vehicles in the city, with 20 units in two routes which goes from Cebu City Hall to Cebu IT Park via Robinsons Galleria, Cebu Business Park and vice versa. The other route goes from Paseo Arcenas at R. Duterte Street to Sykes in Panagdait, Barangay Mabolo via Happy Valley, Fuente Osme√±a, Ramos St., D. Jakosalem St., Cebu Business Park and vice versa. Each air conditioned beep has a seating capacity of 24 passengers, and can accommodate an additional 10 standing passengers. The service also operates 24/7. Recently, they have also opened a third route which goes from Guadalupe to Carbon Market. PeoplesJeep is a new modern jeepney that was launched in September 2019 with 15 units in 3 routes: Talamban-Ayala-Colon, Lahug-Ayala-SM and Bulacao-Colon-SM. Starting October 1, 2019, they will charge a passenger fare of PHP 10. =Buses= Most of the buses and mini-buses are stationed in Cebu South Bus Terminal (CSBT), owned by the Cebu Provincial Government, at N. Bacalso Avenue, Cebu City. The terminal serves passengers heading to the southern part of Cebu and neighboring provinces of Negros Oriental and Zamboanga del Norte. MyBus, a public bus transportation operated by Metro Rapid Transit Services, Inc. (MRTSI), serves passengers coming the city going to Talisay City, Mandaue City up to Mactan-Cebu International Airport. It can accommodate up to 90 passengers including standing passengers. =Vehicles for hire= There were 6,000 taxicabs operating in Cebu as of early 2018 according to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) in Region 7 and most of which ply the roads of Cebu City. The minimum flag down rate is PHP 40 with an additional PHP 13.50 for every succeeding kilometer and PHP 2 for every two minutes of waiting time during traffic. They can be flagged down at any time of the day along any roads in the city. Grab and MiCab also operate in Cebu. =Motorcycle taxis (habal-habal)= Despite being not a legal mode of public transportation in the Philippines, motorcycle taxis, locally known as \\"habal- habal\\", have long been a staple in the mountain barangays of Cebu City that are inaccessible by 4-wheel vehicles. Due to the high volume of traffic in some parts of the city and convenience of passengers especially during rush hours, several motorcycle taxis have propagated in the lowland with more than 6,000 of them that can be hailed along the road or can be booked using Angkas, a motorcycle-hailing platform. Fare for motorcycle taxis not under Angkas is done thru negotiation with the driver. The city government has also been supportive of this mode of public transportation and spearheaded in organizing its drivers to address concerns about passenger safety. A bill was refiled by Cebu City North District Representative Raul del Mar in the House of Representatives to legalize the operations of motorcycle taxis while a pending city ordinance regulating motorcycle taxis has the support of the city's mayor Edgardo Labella. =Horse-drawn carriages (tartanilla)= Before the introduction of motorized vehicles in 1901, \\"tartanillas\\" were the primary means of transportation in the city until the 1970s. Also known in Filipino as \\"kalesa\\", these two-wheeled carriage drawn by a single horse have only limited routes covering Barangays Pasil & Duljo Fatima and Magallanes, Taboan & Carbon Streets. =Motorized and electric tricycles= Motorized tricycle is a mode of transportation for tertiary roads in the city and are not allowed on national highways. Some electric tricycles or \\"e-trikes\\" are also starting to appear in certain roads of the city. =Pedal-operated tricycles (trisikads)= This mode of transportation locally known as trisikad (also called as sikad or sikad-sikad) is commonly used in accessing inner roads in the urban area of the city. Similar with motorized tricycles, they are not allowed to ply on national highways. Maritime transport Passenger and cargo ships coming from within and outside the country arrive at the Port of Cebu which is managed by the Cebu Port Authority. The city is home to more than 80% of the country's island vessels traveling on domestic routes mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao. Ferry boats going to Lapu-Lapu City dock at Pier 3. Those operated by Metro Ferry, Inc. can accommodate up to 270 passengers with a travel time of 15 minutes to Muelle Osme√±a docking point while those operated by Topline Marina can accommodate 325 passengers with a travel time of 35 to 40 minutes. Infrastructure =Piers= The Port of Cebu, located in the North Reclamation Area of Cebu City, Philippines, is the largest domestic port in the Philippines. Managed by the Cebu Port Authority, it mostly serves routes in the Visayas and Mindanao. It is situated in the Mactan Channel, a narrow strait between the islands of Cebu and Mactan. =Roads and expressways= Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway Cebu City will have its first toll bridge expressway with the construction of the Cebu‚ÄìCordova Link Expressway (CCLEX). Expected to open in 2021, CCLEX will connect the city to Cordova and will provide an alternative route for passengers going to Lapu- Lapu City. Metro Cebu Expressway At approximately 73.75 km (45.82 mi) long, the proposed Metro Cebu Expressway, also known as the Cebu Circumferential Road, will serve as an alternative highway connecting Naga City to Danao City to address the traffic congestion within Metro Cebu and will cross the mountain barangays of Cebu City.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The first sessions house in Beverley was located in a building at Hall Garth on a site which had previously accommodated the archbishop's manor house. In the early 19th century the justices decided to allow the lease on the building at Hall Garth to expire and, instead, chose to procure a new sessions house in New Walk. A prison facility or \\"house of correction\\", which could accommodate around 60 prisoners at a time, had already been built in Norfolk Street, to the rear of the proposed site for the sessions house, in 1810. The new building, which was designed by Watson and Pritchett in the classical style, was completed in 1814. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto New Walk; the central section of three bays featured a two-storey tetrastyle portico with full height Ionic order columns; the doorway was flanked by windows on the ground floor and there were three arched windows on the first floor; there was a large pediment containing a Royal coat of arms topped with a figure of justice above. The quarter sessions and the petty sessions were both held in the courtroom. After the prisoners had been dispersed to alternative facilities in the West Riding, the prison closed in 1878 and prison buildings were subsequently converted into private housing. The sessions house continued to be used as the local facility for dispensing justice but, in the late 19th century, along with the Guildhall, it was also used as the meeting place for the East Riding County Council until County Hall was completed in 1891. Facilities for the local police force were established in an adjacent building to the north of the sessions house and substantially enlarged when the police station became a constabulary headquarters in 1930. The sessions house continued to be used as a courthouse throughout the 20th century, latterly for the Crown Court, and repairs were carried out to the roof to extend the use of the building in 1984. It ceased operating as a courthouse in 1988 and was empty and deteriorating until it was marketed for sale in 1999. It was then converted for commercial use and re-opened as a spa, beauty salon and boutique in 2004. In March 2019 it featured in the Channel 5 television series \\"The House of Extraordinary People\\".

He advocated for the ethical consideration and treatment of animals and authored several articles, books, essays and pamphlets on ethics, vegetarianism, humanitarianism and education. He is best known for his work The Universal Kinship (1906), which advocated for a secular sentiocentric philosophy he called the doctrine of \\"Universal Kinship\\", based on the shared evolutionary kinship between all sentient beings.  Biography  = Early life and education = Moore was born on a farm in Missouri in 1862, the son of William A. Moore, a farmer; he had two brothers and two sisters. During the first 30 years of his life, he and his family moved between Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. Moore studied at Oskaloosa College (now defunct), in Iowa, during the 1880s, but did not graduate. In 1884, he became an examiner for the Board of Teachers for Mitchell County, Kansas. Moore was struck by lightning in 1885, receiving burns to his arm and chest and temporarily losing his sight and capacity for speech; he made a full recovery after six days of bed rest. In 1886, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Around this time, he became a vegetarian for ethical reasons. In 1889, he was employed by the National Lecture Bureau, delivering lectures in a manner which led to him being described as \\"the matchless silver tongue of Kansas\\". From 1890 to 1893, he continued to work as a lecturer. In 1894, he started at the University of Chicago with advanced academic standing. He soon helped form and became president of the vegetarian eating club at the university. He was also a member of the university's prohibition club, taking part in several local and statewide oratorical contests on prohibition. In 1895, he won first honors at the national contest in Cleveland, for his oration \\"The Scourge of the Republic\\". At this time, he was known to be a supporter of women's suffrage. Moore was an influential member of the Chicago Vegetarian Society (formed around 1890) and the Humanitarian League, an English radical advocacy group; under his direction, he modelled the society as an American version of the League. In 1895, the society published Why I Am a Vegetarian, based on a speech Moore made, in which he laid out the reasons for his vegetarianism. In the summer of 1896, he accepted the chair of sociology at Wisconsin State University and lectured on the topic of social progress. Drawing of Moore in 1895, from an article published in the Waterbury Evening Democrat In 1898, Moore was given a full-page column in the Chicago Vegetarian, the Chicago Vegetarian Society's journal, which started in 1896; this increased his influence on the society and its overall message. Moore graduated in the same year, earning an A.B. degree in zoology. After graduation, he taught ethics in Calumet High School and briefly in Wisconsin. In 1899, he married Louise Jessie (Jennie) Darrow (1866‚Äì1955) in Racine, Wisconsin; they had met in Chicago. She was an elementary school teacher and a fellow advocate for animal rights and vegetarianism, and the sister of renowned lawyer Clarence Darrow. The couple soon returned to Chicago and Moore joined Crane Technical High School as an instructor in biology and ethics; he taught at the school for the last 20 years of his life. = Later life and career = Moore published Better World Philosophy in 1899, in which he laid out what he considered fundamental problems with the world, stemming from an evolved preponderance towards egoism in humans and other sentient beings, which led them to exploit their fellows, treating them as a means to an end to satisfy their desires. In response, he argued for a \\"Confederation of the Consciousnesses\\", as an ideal arrangement of the living universe, where sentient individuals of all species bring together their talents and collaborate for the benefit of all. The book was endorsed by Lester F. Ward and David S. Jordan. Moore expanded on these ideas in The Universal Kinship (1906) and The New Ethics (1907), arguing for the inevitability of socialism, as the path of least resistance to \\"a civilisation based on the shining and imperishable foundations of Brotherhood and Mutual Love\\", and against the claimed divinity and exceptionalism of humankind, stating that \\"[m]an is not a fallen god, but a promoted reptile\\". He asserted that the ethical implications of the shared evolutionary kinship of sentient beings‚Äîcombined with the Golden Rule‚Äîshould form the basis for a secular philosophy which he termed \\"Universal Kinship\\". He argued that the doctrine was not new and was almost as old as philosophy itself, citing the Buddha, Pythagoras, Plutarch, Shelley and Tolstoy as adherents. Following this doctrine, he asserted‚Äîin a utilitarian fashion‚Äîthat humans must work together to reduce the suffering and increase the happiness of their fellow humans and other sentient kin: > Yes, do as you would be done by‚Äîand not to the dark man and the white woman > alone, but to the sorrel horse and the gray squirrel as well; not to > creatures of your own anatomy only, but to all creatures. You cannot go high > enough nor low enough nor far enough to find those whose bowed and broken > beings will not rise up at the coming of the kindly heart, or whose souls > will not shrink and darken at the touch of inhumanity. Live and let live. Do > more. Live and help live. Do to beings below you as you would be done by > beings above you. Pity the tortoise, the katydid, the wild-bird, and the ox. > Poor, undeveloped, untaught creatures! Into their dim and lowly lives strays > of sunshine little enough, though the fell hand of man be never against > them. They are our fellow-mortals. They came out of the same mysterious womb > of the past, are passing through the same dream, and are destined to the > same melancholy end, as we ourselves. Let us be kind and merciful to them. Moore was a close correspondent and friend of fellow Humanitarian League member Henry S. Salt, who later described The Universal Kinship as \\"the best ever written in the humanitarian cause\\" and they worked together to popularize Moore's doctrine within the humane movement; this was largely unsuccessful. As well as his work as a high school teacher and author, Moore gave frequent lectures on vegetarianism, the humane treatment of animals, anti- vivisectionism, evolution and ethics. He also authored articles and pamphlets for humane organizations and journals, including \\"the Humanitarian League, the Millennium Guild, the Massachusetts SPCA, the American-Anti-Vivisection Society, the American Humane Association, and the Chicago Vegetarian Society\\". Additionally, Moore wrote in support of the temperance movement and humane education‚Äîeducational reform in favor of the teaching of ethics and humaneness. Photograph of Moore from a 1908 advertisement for his works Moore was a fierce critic of American imperialism and America's actions in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, publishing an article entitled \\"America's Apostasy\\", in 1899. He also denounced Theodore Roosevelt and his hunting expedition to Africa, describing Roosevelt as having \\"done more in the last six months to dehumanise mankind than all the humane societies can do to counteract it in years\\". In an article titled \\"The Source of Religion\\", he criticised religion, describing it as \\"an anachronism today, with our science and understanding\\". Following the passing of a law in Illinois prescribing that teaching of morals in public schools, in 1912, Moore published three books on ethics to be used as educational material: High-School Ethics, Ethics and Education and The Ethics of School Life‚Äîbased on a lesson that Moore gave to high-school students. High-School Ethics was intended to form the first part of a four- year course, including topics such as evolution, the ethics of school life and business, the ethical treatment of animals, social justice, eugenics, women's rights and utilitarianism. Moore delivered a speech entitled \\"Discovering Darwin\\", at the International Anti-vivisection and Animal protection Congress, held in Washington D.C, in 1913. The speech claimed that vivisection and the consumption of meat are a product of anthropocentrism and that Darwin's On the Origin of Species, had made any notion of human superiority or uniqueness untenable and ethically indefensible. In 1914, Moore gave a speech in Chicago, at Hull House, in favor of sex education and published The Law of Biogenesis. In the first part of the book, he described how the physical laws which govern the way an embryo grows into an animal before and after birth, and how this can be traced back to the species' evolutionary history. In the second part, he argued that the same laws apply to the developing minds of children, which \\"passes through stages of savagery and barbarism like those experienced by the human race in past ages\\". His last work, Savage Survivals was published in 1916, in which he traced the ethical and cultural evolution of humans and other animals, from the past to the present day.  Death  Jackson Park, Chicago's Wooded Island during the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893; the site of Moore's death in 1916 On June 17, 1916, at the age of 53, Moore died by a self-inflicted gun wound on Wooded Island in Jackson Park, Chicago. He had visited the island regularly to observe and study birds. Moore had struggled for many years with an unspecified illness and chronic pain from an abdominal operation for gallstones, in 1911. He had also expressed continuing despondency at human indifference towards the suffering of their fellow animals. In a suicide note found on his body by a police officer, he had written: > The long struggle is ended. I must pass away. Good-by. Oh, men are so cold > and hard and half conscious toward their suffering fellows. Nobody > understands. O my mother, and O my little girl! What will become of you? And > the poor four-footed! May the long years be merciful! Take me to my river. > There, where the wild birds sing and the waters go on and on, alone in my > groves, forever. O, Tess, forgive me. O, forgive me, please! His brother-in-law, Clarence Darrow, delivered a eulogy at Moore's funeral, describing him as having died while \\"suffering under a temporary fit of sanity\\" and as having been a \\"dead dreamer\\"; the eulogy was later published. Moore was buried in Excelsior Cemetery, Mitchell County, Kansas.  Legacy  An obituary published soon after Moore's death, in the Chicago Tribune, labelled Moore as a misanthrope. An obituary published by the Humanitarian League's journal The Humanitarian, described him, in much more positive terms, as \\"one of the most devoted and distinguished humanitarians with whom the League has had the honor of being connected\\". Henry S. Salt dedicated his 1923 book The Story of My Cousins to Moore and in his 1930 autobiography Company I Have Kept, he reflected on the strength of their friendship, even though the two never met in person. A selection of Moore's letters to Salt was included in the appendix of the 1992 edition of The Universal Kinship (edited by Charles R. Magel). Moore has been recognized as an early, but neglected, advocate for ethical vegetarianism; Rod Preece in Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought, asserts that Moore's ethical vegetarian advocacy was \\"ahead of his time\\", as it appears to not have had \\"any direct influence on the American intelligentsia.\\" Moore's ethical approach has been compared to Albert Schweitzer and Peter Singer, with Moore's views identified as anticipating Singer's analysis of speciesism. The environmental historian Roderick Nash argues that both Moore and Edward Payson Evans, \\"deserve more recognition than they have received as the first professional philosophers in the United States to look beyond anthropocentrism.\\" Animal rights activist Henry Spira cited Moore as an example of a leftist who wasn't uncomfortable about advocating for animal rights. Animal rights author Jon Hochschartner describes Moore's The Universal Kinship as an animal liberationist text, but criticizes his endorsements of social Darwinism and scientific racism, while acknowledging that such views were likely common at the time Moore was writing, drawing attention to the fact that the book was endorsed by several notable progressives. Moore's last work Savage Survivals, has similarly been criticized as an example of scientific racism by the prehistoric archaeologist Robin Dennell. Mark Pittenger argues that Moore's racism was influenced by Herbert Spencer's The Principles of Sociology and that similar views were held by contemporary American socialists.

Howard Moore"},{"id":"61857242","text":"Portrait of Giovanni Randaccio, c.1915 Life Giovanni Randaccio was born in Turin in 1884 to a father of Sardinian origins and a mother from Vercelli. He began his military career in the infantry as a second lieutenant. He was promoted first to lieutenant, and then, on the outbreak of the First world war, captain. On 24 December 1914 he became a freemason joining the Vomere lodge in Naples.Vittorio Gnocchini, L'Italia dei Liberi Muratori, Erasmo ed., Roma, 2005, p. 231. Randaccio's war record was outstanding. He consistently displayed great courage and boldness, and was awarded many honours. He earned his first Silver Medal of Military Valor during the assault on :it:Monte Sei Busi on 1 June 1915; and his second silver medal after the attack on the heights of (it) Polazzo on 21 October 1915. Seriously wounded, he was exempted from further service but insisted on returning to the front. In October 1916 he earned his third silver medal and a promotion to the rank of major at the taking of Veliki Kribach. Wounded once more, he again returned to the front. Randaccio was placed in command of the 2nd battalion of the 77th Regiment of Infantry. Here he met Gabriele D'Annunzio, then working as liaison officer between the 45th Division and the 7th Infantry Division Lupi di Toscana, of which the regiment was a part. Both Randaccio and D‚ÄôAnnunzio, whom he commanded, took part in the Eighth and Ninth Battle of the Isonzo. A deep friendship and mutual admiration grew up between the two men. Death Promontario Bratina (Quota 28) On 27 May 1917, during the Tenth Battle of the Isonzo, Major Randaccio launched his battalion in a perilous assault on Quota 28 (‚Äòhill 28‚Äô, on the Bratina promontory), on the other side of the Timavo river. Having taken the hill with heavy losses, Randaccio himself fell under a burst of enemy machine gun fire. He was taken to the \\"Scuola Popolare\\" in Monfalcone which was serving as a field hospital, but died soon afterwards. He was originally buried in Monfalcone on 30 May but his body was then transferred to Aquileia cathedral where a grand funeral was held for him. There is a lack of certainty about the precise date of his death. The memorial erected on the site of the field hospital records the date of his death as 27 May. However, according to the official account of the military headquarters, the action that resulted in his death began during the night of 28 May and hill 28 was taken on the morning of the following day. Furthermore, the official citation for the award of the Gold Medal of Military Valour also refers to his death as being on 28 May. Disputed accounts What became the official account of the circumstances of Randaccio's death was set out in the oration made by D'Annunzio at Randaccio's funeral, which the Duke of Aosta had printed and distributed to the soldiers of the Third Army in the interests of their 'moral preparation' as combattants. In this account, the Italians had tried for two days to force a crossing of the Timavo river, without success, before receiving orders to suspend operations. D'Annunzio then himself proposed an audacious assault on the enemy lines with the objective of moving along the coast to Duino. The intention was to raise the Italian flag from the top of the Duino castle, from where it would be visible in Trieste 21 kilometers away. This was to be a propaganda victory rather than the securing of an important military objective. Memorial to Giovanni Randaccio at San Giovanni di Duino To achieve this, the Italian troops needed to cross the mouth of the Timavo river on temporary catwalks made from 40 cm-wide boards, fixed to empty oil drums, and then take the Austrian batteries on the Bratina promontory. This assault began on 27 May. Despite terrible losses under enemy fire, the Italians succeeded in taking hill 28. However the Austrians brought up reinforcements and retook it, cutting off many Italian troops as they did so. At this, a number of Italian soldiers hoisted a white flag and surrendered. According to D‚ÄôAnnunzio's account, Randaccio was struck by an Austrian bullet before the hill was taken. D‚ÄôAnnunzio was by his side, and rested his head on the folded tricolour Italian flag. Several times Randaccio asked if the hill had been taken, as D‚ÄôAnnunzio lied, telling him that it had because, as he said, ‚Äúa hero cannot do other than die victorious.‚Äù According to D‚ÄôAnnunzio, as he lay dying Randaccio begged D‚ÄôAnnunzio to give him the poison capsule that the poet, he knew, always carried with him in battle. Three times he asked for it and three times D‚ÄôAnnunzio refused because, as he explained in his funeral oration: \\"It was necessary for him to suffer so that his life could become sublime in the immortality of death\\". However, according to the account included in the official citation for his gold medal, he succeeded in taking the hill but was shot soon afterwards. According to other accounts, having taken and lost at the hill, Randaccio showed great bravery in leading his men in retreat, ensuring that they made their way back to the river, where they threw themselves in the water and swam back across. While escorting the last of them off the promontory, Randaccio was struck by enemy fire. Orderlies carried him towards safety on a stretcher under fire, but he was struck by a second bullet, and they dropped him and fled. He was eventually brought to safety but did not survive long. Exactly what role D‚ÄôAnnunzio played during the last hours of his friend‚Äùs life is difficult to determine. While his own account may give the impression that they were together on the front line, D‚ÄôAnnunzio never crossed the river himself, remaining on the west bank throughout the fighting. According to some accounts, D‚ÄôAnnunzio was so enraged at the retreat from hill 28 that he ordered the Italian artillery to open fire on its own men as they struggled to get back across the Timavo. According to Guido Agosti (see bibliography) Randaccio himself never crossed the river either, observing the advance from the west bank, throwing himself onto the catwalk to assist his retreating men and being mortally wounded there. To add to the uncertainty, the stele memorialising Randaccio's death has been moved. It was originally placed on the west bank of the Timavo, near a footbridge, in 1919. However it now lies at San Giovanni di Duino alongside the SS14 road, under the monument to the Wolves of Tuscany, where it was moved following the industrialization of the Lisert district. At least one authority suggests that the move dates to 1932; however the 1949 Duino sheet of the Military Geographic Institute shows the \\"Cippo Randaccio\\" still in its original position, on the west bank. Legacy Randaccio became a central figure in D‚ÄôAnnunzio's hero mythology, as a martyr and sacrificial victim. The flag on which D‚ÄôAnnunzio had first rested his head and later wrapped his body was used to cover his coffin at his funeral; it was to become a key symbolic object during the Italian Regency of Carnaro and D‚ÄôAnnunzio later kept it at his home, Vittoriale degli Italiani. There are many streets and schools in Italy named after Randaccio. There is also a piazza Giovanni Randaccio in Rome.

Prior to this role, he held academic and directorial positions at the universities of Durham, Lincoln, and Lancaster. His areas of academic interest are business and entrepreneurship, particularly related to small and medium-sized enterprises and China. Education Atherton read Chinese and Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, graduating in 1989. This was followed, in 1992, by a Master's degree in International and Development Economics at Yale University in the United States. As a result of his studies of China, he is fluent in Mandarin. Andrew completed a PhD by publication in 2012 on the effectiveness of government enterprise policy at the University of Lincoln. Career Atherton began his academic career at Durham University, in the Small Business Centre, Durham University Business School. He was Director of the Policy Research Unit within the Small Business Centre from 1995 to 1999, establishing the Centre as an international policy research unit. In 1999, he became Head of Department of the department the Foundation for SME Development at the Durham University, which at that time was one of the world's leading centres for small and medium enterprise development and enterprise. He then moved to the University of Lincoln in 2002, where he worked for 10 years, initially as Director of Research in the Business School and then as Acting Dean of the School. He was appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor Strategy and Enterprise in 2006 and in 2010 became Senior Deputy Vice- Chancellor. In this role he worked toward the establishment of the School of Engineering, the first new engineering school in the UK for over 20 years, as well as contributing to the emergence of the University as one of the leading modern universities in the UK. From Lincoln, he moved on to Lancaster in 2013 as Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Entrepreneurship. As Deputy Vice- Chancellor at the University of Lancaster, he was responsible for the development of the University, leading on resource planning and the annual planning cycle. He also led on creation of the Health Innovation Campus, a science park adjacent to the University, and was part of a team that attracted the Eden Project to Morecambe to create Eden North At Lancaster, Atherton also led on creation of a new campus in China, as a Joint Institute with Beijing Telecommunications University and creation of Lancaster University Leipzig, a campus based in Germany, which recruited its first students in 2019. Atherton has published extensively on enterprise and small and medium enterprise development. On small and medium-size enterprises in China, Atherton had a book published (Entrepreneurship in China) with co-author Alex Newman in 2017. After the retirement of Professor Sir Pete Downes from his principality at the University of Dundee, Atherton was announced as his successor in 2018. His tenure officially began on 1 January 2019. During his period as Principal, the University rose to 4th in the UK for student satisfaction, its best ever result, and to its highest league table position of 24th in the Sunday Times University Guide and 3rd in Scotland. The University was named Student Experience University of the Year by the Sunday Times as a result of its rise in student satisfaction. On 30 and 31 October 2019, several Scottish newspapers reported that Atherton had been suspended from office, pending an independent investigation into allegations that he had failed to pay rent in full on the Principal's official residence‚ÄîUniversity House. In a statement to the BBC, a university spokesperson said: \\"As is our policy in any disciplinary case, it would not be appropriate for the university to comment further while the process is ongoing.\\" Later, some sources reported that allegations of bullying had been made against Atherton, although it was unclear whether or not this was related to the ongoing investigation or suspension and these claims were not substantiated. On 8 November 2019, it was announced that Atherton had resigned. The University statement was as follows \\"In the short time that Professor Atherton has been with the University he has shown a commitment to excellence. His broad experience has brought fresh ideas, a focus on sustainability and a drive to further enhance the University's national and global standing. However, it has become apparent that the University‚Äôs vision for its future and the values it holds are different to the aspirations of Professor Atherton. He has therefore decided to step down so that the University can continue to pursue its current strategy.\\" The financial statements 2019 for the University state that an outstanding balance of one month's rent was settled on August 1st 2019.

Johnson (died January 1, 1916) was an Irish-born priest who ministered in the Archdiocese of Boston. Personal life Johnson was born in Ireland and fluent in Irish. He was friends with Henry Cabot Lodge. Following the Spanish-American War, Johnson spoke out against the atrocities the United States government was committing against the Filipinos. He died on January 1, 1916, and was buried on January 4 in Lowell, Massachusetts, after a funeral at Gate of Heaven Church in South Boston. There was a large crowd of priests in attendance and the church was not big enough to hold all of the people who wished to attend. Ministry Johnson built St. Mary's Church in Dedham, St. Eulalia's at City Point, and Gate of Heaven Church in South Boston. He also served as a curate at S.S. Peter and Paul in South Boston. On July 1, 1898, he was appointed chaplain of the Suffolk County House of Correction. It was said that he \\"was a perfect treasure-house of theological lore.\\" =St. Mary's Church= Johnson served as past of St. Mary's Church in Dedham, Massachusetts from August 1878 to 1890. During this decade, Johnson was publicly raising the issue of discrimination against Catholics in the public schools. He served two terms on the Dedham School Committee, from 1884 to 1890. As a member of the School Committee in 1885, he claimed the principal of the Avery School ridiculed Catholic students, and several years later had a lengthy debate with a Protestant minister via letters in the Dedham Standard about the \\"rank misrepresentation of the Catholic Church\\" in a history book adopted by the School Committee. During Johnson's pastorate, the cornerstone of the present St. Mary's Church church was dedicated on October 17, 1880 by Archbishop John Williams. A crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood to accommodate all those who wished to attend. It was one of the largest gatherings in Dedham's history. The crowd included many of the leading citizens of Dedham as well as 30 priests. The clergy included Father Theodore Metcalf of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross who served as Master of Ceremonies. The footprint of the Gothic church, which Father Johnson said was to be a \\"cathedral in the wilderness,\\" measures 150' long by 65' wide, and the bell tower is 164' tall. To serve the Catholics of East Dedham, he built St. Raphael's Church, but it was destroyed by fire a few years later. When he left St. Mary's, the Catholics and Protestants of the town were both sorry to see him go. He had become friends with all, including many of the leading men in town. =Gate of Heaven Church= After leaving St. Mary's, Johnson was pastor of Gate of Heaven Church from 1890 to his death in 1916. Johnson became pastor on June 1, 1890. He was known as the \\"second founder\\" of Gate of Heaven. During his first years at Gate of Heaven, the parish had 10,000 parishioners and 600 girls enrolled in the school. With many societies and programs running, the church was too small to accommodate them. On March 4, 1895, the church caught on fire and the interior was destroyed. On April 10, 1895, services began inside the old church again, but it continued to be too small. Johnson began raising funds for a new church, partly though his personal magnetism. In 1896, the cornerstone was laid for a new church by Archbishop Williams. While construction was ongoing, he opened St. Eulalia's Chapel in City Point on May 6, 1900. During construction, the stained glass windows were originally to be shipped from London duty-free. After two had been installed, however, the Treasury Department overruled the decision of the local collector and demanded a duty payment for the windows already installed and those yet to be delivered. Eventually Congress passed special legislation exempting the windows from the duty and, as a result of this precedent, all stained glass windows for houses of worship were exempt from duty in the Tariff Act of 1913.

The area is bound by Alberta Highway 2A to the west, Red Deer city limits the north, Range Road 272 to the east, and the south boundaries of quarter sections along Township Road 374 (McKenzie Road) to the south. It is bisected by Alberta Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway), which has resulted in the area being divided into Gasoline Alley East and Gasoline Alley West.  Description  Gasoline Alley is a predominantly commercial and light industrial area located along Alberta Highway 2 in Red Deer County. As of 2018, it also includes a residential community named Liberty Landing. Due to the area being divided by Highway 2, the area is referred to as Gasoline Alley East and Gasoline Alley West. Gasoline Alley South is used in reference to the area located west of Highway 2 and south of McKenzie Road which is characterized by warehouses and logistical companies. The following various industrial and business parks form part of Gasoline Alley. * Gasoline Alley East ** Clearview Industrial Park ** Energy Business Park ** McKenzie Industrial Park ** Petrolia Industrial Park ** Piper Creek Business Park * Gasoline Alley West ** Hamlet of Gasoline Alley including the urban residential community of Liberty Landing  History  Gasoline Alley began as a private rest area due to its location near Red Deer, midway between the cities of Calgary and Edmonton. Gas stations and restaurants were located along Highway 2 on service roads located just south of Red Deer city limits, with some business located on both sides of the highway to service northbound and southbound travellers respectively. In 1995, Alberta Transportation opened the McKenzie Road interchange, which allowed travellers from either direction of Highway 2 to better access both sides of Gasoline Alley. Around the same time, Red Deer County began expanding and developing Gasoline Alley to have more industrial and retail development, with Gasoline Alley West now having big box stores such as Costco and a movie theatre.

Enriquez (November 24, 1942 - August 31, 1994), also known as Doc E, was a social psychologist and the Father of Filipino psychology \\"Ama ng Sikolohiyang Pilipino\\". He was born on November 24, 1942 at Santol, Balagtas formally Bigaa, Bulacan. He was the youngest of 5 children to Arsenio Libiran Enriquez and Rosario Galvez Gaspar. He is the founder of the Pambansang Samahan sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino, (corporate name: National Association for Sikolohiyang Pilipino, Inc.). Through his efforts and discoveries, the concept of psychology has gradually been acknowledged by more people in the Philippines and other non-western cultures. The research model he used provided valuable information on culture-as-target and culture-as-source approach which have a tremendous influence in regulating practical applications. Before Enriquez, the study of psychology in the Philippines was not productive due to a language barrier; a large amount of psychological literature from Western history was only available in English. Enriquez's work inspired Filipino researchers with the concept of Western research methods in psychology and have broadened the view of cross-cultural psychology. Filipino psychology remains a controversial topic. From the perspective of future development, Filipino psychology will pay more attention to individual and feminist treatments. The current therapeutic methods given in Filipino psychology are more group-oriented instead of individual-based thus individual patients will not receive precise treatments and follow-up diagnosis corresponding to their conditions. There is still an issue of unstandardized testing instruments in terms of therapeutic techniques which lack proper regulations. In spite of its imperfections, the growth of Filipino psychology has contributed to the increased social acceptance for psychological disorders and initiative for seeking effective treatments.  Education  Enriquez earned his B.A. in Philosophy from the University of the Philippines in 1961. In 1966, he attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, to pursue a Masters, and later a Doctorate degree in social psychology. He then returned to the Philippines in 1971 to continue teaching psychology. Filipino psychology was created because he noticed that scholars and intellectuals in the Philippines were dissatisfied with the Western-oriented take on psychology as their models did not fit with Filipino culture and behavior. As such, he focused more on a Filipino-oriented teaching model in his teaching and research including using Filipino to lecture and exam.  Career history  = Filipino psychology = Even as there was ‚Äúno concerted effort in the 1960s to reject and correct traditional way of teaching and studying psychology‚Äù, this changed in the 1970s when Enriquez introduced Filipino psychology, also called Sikolohiyang Pilipino--his most significant contribution to the realm of psychology. According to Enriquez, Filipino psychology is the fruit of experience, ideas, and orientation of Filipinos. He also said that a Filipino can better understand himself and in turn, is able to improve his life more. Different from traditional psychology, Filipino psychology identifies what the key concepts are in order to have an understanding of a Filipino's mind, personality and behaviour, while also looking at human behaviour from non-western culture context. Filipino psychology \\"began in the early 1970s initially as a protest against Philippine psychology's colonial character and the uncritical acceptance of American psychological models.\\" It ‚Äúurges Filipino psychologists to confront social problems and national issues as part of their responsibility as social scientists.‚Äù A way to understand the Filipino character, it is helpful to analyze the social interaction in a Philippine setting. A conceptual distinction in many different levels and modes of interaction is provided by the Filipino language. There are 8 levels of interaction that were found by Santiago and Enriquez; these levels include pakikitungo (transaction/civility with), pakikisalamuha (interaction with), pakikilahok (joining/participating with), pakikibagay (in conformity with/in accord with), pakikisama (getting along with), pakikipag-palagayang-Ioob (having rapport with), pakikisangkot (getting involved with), and pakikiisa (being one with).‚Äù Enriquez coined the term 'kapwa', and he believes it to be the only term that both categories of \\"outsider\\" (ibang tao) and \\"insider\\" (Hindi ibang tao). He used this term to ‚Äúexplain Filipino interpersonal relations.‚Äù The English word \\"others\\" is what is thought to be the closest English equivalent of \\"kapwa.\\" Although ‚Äúkapwa\\" is similar, it means the unity of the ‚Äòself‚Äô and the ‚Äòothers‚Äô. A prominent student of Enriquez, Katrin de Guia also studied kapwa and asserted that it is the shared identity between the self and others. = Indigenous Psychology = Virgilio Enriquez was a prominent advocate of indigenous psychology in Asia. This academic movement arose from Western psychology's lack of applicability to non-Western societies and thereby promoted cultural sensitivity and appropriateness within psychology by enabling each culture to develop their own frameworks and methodologies. Enriquez coined the term culture-as-source to indicate that every culture is a contributor to psychological knowledge, contrasting from the approach he referred to as culture-as-target which regards cultures as being dependent on other cultures to gain psychological knowledge. Enriquez and his colleague Carmen Santiago made a contribution to indigenous research methods by providing data gathering techniques that are relevant and applicable to Filipino culture. Their research model is made up of two scales that exist on a continuum including Iskala ng Mananaliksik as well as Iskala ng Pagtutunguhan ng Mananaliksik at Kalahok. The former being the researcher/method scale where the observational methods are unobtrusive such as pagmamasid, where no manipulation occurs, rather the investigator solely observes the natural environment. The latter being the researcher- participant relationship scale that is regarded as more intrusive, involving a stronger relationship between the respondents and the investigators. For instance, multiple encounters in the respondents‚Äô home involving participant interviewing take place, referred to as padalaw-dala w. Techniques that lie in the center of the continuum, including the pagtatanung-tanong research model entails casual interaction between both parties. It incorporates a combination of surveys and informant interviewing where questions are asked to different respondents in random order.  Accomplishments and contributions to psychology  = Accomplishments = As Enriquez worked to break boundaries and instigate different learning practices, he received many high accolades in his profession. Most notably in 1982, he was given the Outstanding Young Scientist of the Philippines award by the National Academy of Science and Technology, and after his passing was awarded the National Achievement in the Social Sciences in 1997 from the National Research Council of the Philippines. = Contributions = Enriquez made several substantial contributions to the field of psychology, particularly in relation to Filipino values and society. Similar to many countries who are also colonized, there is a sense of identity loss and cultural theft as adaptation to Western practices occur. After getting his Ph.D. in the US, Enriquez returned to the Philippines to create new teaching methods in collaboration with the University of the Philippines with the goal of taking a deeper look at ‚ÄúPhilippine psychology and developing creativity and inventiveness among Filipinos.‚Äù On this path of education and research, Enriquez helped to officiate the First National Conference on Filipino Psychology (Unang Pambansang Kumperensya sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino) as well as created the Philippine Psychology Research House (PPRH), later known as the Philippine Psychology Research and Training House, home to Filipino psychology and the growth of research with Filipino perspective. = Publications = Enriquez is also well known for the numerous books he authored throughout his career such as Indigenous Psychology and National Consciousness (Enriquez, 1989) to his final publication Pagbabangong-Dangal: Indigenous Psychology & Cultural Empowerment (Enriquez, 1994). Areas of his research included ‚Äúindigienous psychology, Filipino personality, psychology of language and politics, philosophy and values, cross-cultural psychology, and Pilipinolohiya (Philippine Studies).‚Äù = Later life = Enriquez went on to become Chairman of the Department of Psychology at the University of the Philippines from 1977‚Äì1982. He continued to inspire and encourage students to embrace the Filipino language and culture, furthering the growth of Filipino psychology and continuity of the national language. He died at the age of 51 on August 31, 1994 in San Francisco, California due to cancer.

The band has headlined tours across the UK, as well as performing at festivals, such as Glastonbury Festival, Farmer Phil's Festival, Boomtown Fair and Bearded Theory. In 2019 the band achieved a career highlight of playing to a packed Big Top stage at Beautiful Days. To date, The Leylines have released two full studio albums and one EP. The band's second studio album, Recover Reveal, was released on 1 March 2019.  Early Years: 2013-14  \\"The name of the band means energy...it means electricity, and when we go into a venue...we feel that energy\\" - Steve Mitchell The Leylines were formed in 2013 when founding members Steve Mitchell, formerly of British rock band Evanfly, along with Matthew Wilkins, of the band The Moderations, went to record a series of demos for a new festival band they wanted to form, of which the band The Levellers were a strong influence. They recorded a few tracks at Sawmills Studios with Tony Hobden & Weston College. Upon listening through the tracks the duo decided to enlist Hannah Johns, a local session violinist, into the band. With the trio formed, they also recruited bassist Peter Fealey and drummer James Dyer. The band's first full band show was in October 2013, supporting 3 Daft Monkeys at Gloucester Guild Hall. On 20 December 2013 the band released the Let It Go E.P., featuring four songs, including the eponymous track Let It Go produced by Tony Hobden in Weston-super-Mare. Following the release of their first E.P. the band began playing music festivals, such as Watchet Festival, Lakefest, Sat In A Field Festival and Something Else In The Dean Festival, where they built a grassroots fanbase. The band also supported Skinny Lister on their Five Cities Tour in October 2014. In late 2014, James Dyer made the decision to leave the band to head to university. Following a relatively short period without a drummer, the band announced the recruitment of Bristol-based Dave Burbidge on 9 December 2014.  First Album & Tours: 2015-16  In 2015 the band released their first single, Sat In A Field to raise money for four charities; Myeloma UK, The Nikita Jade Fund, Somewhere House Somerset and the Children's Hospice South West. The same year the band played Lakefest Festival, and one review commented: \\"The Leylines never fail to impress and once again their driving take on bawdy folk rock left the audience baying for more, having paid witness to an invigorating set by a band built for the biggest of festival stages.\\" The band headed to Brighton, UK to record Along The Old Straight Track in February 2016 (see below). The Leylines' first full UK headlining tour began in February 2017, it was called the \\"Along The Old Straight Track Tour'\\". The tour included 19 dates across the UK.  Line-Up Changes & Second Album: 2017-20  During the summer of 2017, the band made their first appearance at Glastonbury Festival, playing four shows at The Bread & Roses bar, Bimble Inn and Toad Hall stages. That same summer, the band made the decision to change up their sound with the inclusion of an electric guitarist, and they chose to recruit their occasional sound engineer, Dan Thompson. Around the same time, bassist Peter Fealey decided to leave the band to focus on his family. Sean Booth was drafted in to replace Peter Fealey and made his debut with the band, a trial by fire, at their first appearance at Beautiful Days Festival 2017 at the Bimble Inn stage. In March 2018, the band embarked on a pilgrimage to Cornwall, UK to record their second album, Recover Reveal (see below). Summer 2019 was one of the biggest festival seasons yet for the band, with slots at Glastonbury Festival on the Avalon Cafe Stage and The Big Top at Beautiful Days Festival being amongst the multitude of festivals & events they played. As part of the Fly Away Tour in Spring 2020, the band were due to travel to The Netherlands, and support Levellers on their 2020 tour but had to postpone their tour due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  Music  =Along the Old Straight Track (2016) = Recorded at Metway Studios, Brighton, UK in February 2016, Along the Old Straight Track is the band's debut studio album. It was produced by Sean Lakeman and mixed & mastered by Al Scott. The album received praise from Louder Than War: \\"If you buy just one album this year there are eleven excellent reasons as to why it should be The Leylines Along The Old Straight Track. Quite simply you should buy this album.\\" In fact the album was reviewed positively by multiple sources The album title is derived from the book, \\"The Old Straight Track\\" by Alfred Watkins, in which the book explores the use of Ley lines across the UK. =Recover Reveal (2019) = Recorded at Cube Studio, Truro, Cornwall, UK over two weeks in March 2018, Recover Reveal is the band's second studio album. It was produced by Al Scott, who also mixed & mastered the album. During the two weeks, the band lived together in a house in Tregullow, Redruth, close to the recording studio. The album was released on 1 March 2019 and was well received, with airplay on BBC Cambridgeshire (The Folk Show), BBC Gloucestershire (Johnny Coppin) and BBC Shropshire (Genevieve Tudor's Sunday Folk). Reviews for the album were also very positive \\"Long-time favourites on the festival scene, The Leylines bring a raucous energy to everything they do.

Premise  Kitboga began baiting in mid-2017 after he found out that his grandmother was a victim of many types of scams designed to prey on the elderly, both online and in person. He holds that, by wasting the time of scammers, he is preventing them from scamming others and is also providing a source of entertainment and education to his viewers. In doing so, he mixes elements of popular culture into his dialogue during scam calls. = Scambaiting = In his videos, Kitboga engages in scambaiting several types of scammers, a majority of whom operate call centers in India. Besides technical support scammers, he also engages with refund scammers, IRS scammers, and others. To misdirect scammers away from his real identity, as well as for viewer entertainment, Kitboga often acts as a number of characters during his videos, including an 80-year-old grandmother named Edna and a granny named Matilda, a Russian man named Vicktor Viktoor, a valley girl named Nevaeh, or sometimes even a competing technical support scammer named Daniel. He does this by imitating the accent or vocal intonation of the character he is trying to portray, in addition to oftentimes using a voice changer to alter the pitch of his voice. However, the common factor uniting all these characters is that they are not computer-savvy, giving the scammer confidence that the would-be victim is more likely to fall for the ruse. With the use of some hardware voice changer (Roland VT-3 and GoXLR) and different accents, Kitboga role- plays multiple characters, often related to each other.

It took place in early October 1916. In late September 1916, Romanian forces occupied the island, setting up a garrison comprising an infantry company and six guns in two batteries. On 2 October, in support of the FlƒÉm√¢nda Offensive, the Romanian garrison on the island attacked bypassing Austro-Hungarian warships, inflicting some damage and delaying the naval group long enough to allow the Romanian bridge over the Danube to be repaired. However, after an artillery bombardment which started on 7 October, the island was taken by the Central Powers on the 8th, the Romanian garrison being captured. Background Following the defeat of the Romanian 3rd Army at Turtucaia in early September 1916, the commanding general of this army was replaced with Alexandru Averescu on 7 September, whom historian John Buchan considered \\"the ablest of Rumanian generals\\". At the end of September, Romanian forces occupied the island of Cinghinarele. Averescu had deployed on the island an infantry company along with two artillery batteries of three guns each. Cinghinarele is a low-lying island in the Danube, a third of a mile wide and two and a half miles long. It is located at the eastern opening of the Belene Channel. Aside from the garrison, the Romanians had also laid mines near the island.Michael B.

Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 226 Battle On 2 October, the Romanian batteries on the island opened fire at the bypassing warships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's Groups I and IV of the Danube Flotilla. The Romanian guns holed Group I's coal barge, forcing the naval formation to run for cover in order to make repairs. Group IV decided not to risk shell fire hitting its fuel barge, and thus waited until nightfall before moving on. The two naval groups finally arrived a Ryahovo on the morning of 3 October. However, there they discovered that the Romanians had repaired the damage to the bridge and were retreating across it. On 7 October, Group II of Austro-Hungarian monitors (Inn and Sava), along with a German artillery battery of 100 mm guns, began a bombardment of the Cinghinarele. On the 8th, a combined force of German infantry and Austro- Hungarian combat engineers overran the island, capturing the six guns along with 130 prisoners. The flotilla's minesweeping detachment subsequently cleared the channel.Michael B.

The painting belonged to the collection of Walter and Louise Arensberg before being donated in 1950 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where it is currently held. Analysis Fish Magic is seen as an intermingling of aquatic, celestial, and earthly entities. The painting is covered by a delicate surface of black paint, under which lies a dense layer of multicolored pigments. The colorful figures were then scratched and scrawled out by Klee on the dark background. A square of muslin was glued to the painting in the center, giving the painting the sense of a collage. The painting's dark palette and the muslin's fragility create a mysterious and inky atmosphere. Ker writes that \\"Fish Magic is set squarely within the tradition of German Romanticism, with its blend of fantasy and natural empiricism, of poetry and pragmatics.\\" She points to the technique used to draw out the various fish, flora, human beings, and clock tower as \\"a sophisticated version of the games children play with wax crayons.\\" According to Ann Temkin, Fish Magic is a masterpiece in which the intellectual and imaginative forces of Klee's artistic gifts are reconciled, producing a \\"sense of magic\\". Specifically, Temkin points to the thin diagonal line extending from the middle right of the canvas to the top of the clock tower, writing that the \\"long painted line from the side seems ready to pull the [square of muslin] off to reveal something underneath.\\" References Category:Paintings by Paul Klee Category:1925 paintings Category:Paintings of the Philadelphia Museum of Art Category:Fish in art Category:Surrealist paintings ","title":"Fish Magic (Klee)"},{"id":"61858114","text":"React - Include - Recycle (, RIR) is a Portuguese political party led by Vitorino Silva, better known as Tino de Rans.

He is known for his interactive art and technology works, electronic and robotic musical instruments, fire art and guerilla art.  Education  Singer holds a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, a Diploma in Music Synthesis from Berklee College of Music and an M.S. in Computer Science from New York University. Singer has been an Adjunct Professor at both NYU and CMU, designing and teaching graduate courses in electronic art and music, interactive performance and controller design..  Electronic, Computer and Robotic Music  Singer is known internationally as a creator of alternative MIDI controllers and musical instruments, interactive and algorithmic music software and robotic musical instruments. Singer began creating interactive performance software in 1990 as an assistant to Dr. Richard Boulanger. Written primarily in the Max multimedia programming environment, this included software for MIDI controllers such as the Radio Baton and Power Glove. He quickly became known as a Max expert, releasing a series of popular Max plug-ins for video tracking, electronic conducting and artificial life bird-flocking simulation. In the mid-90s, Singer began creating his own novel electronic instruments. One early instrument of note was the Sonic Banana, a rubber tube with bend sensors to control arpeggiators and other generative music. Later instruments included the GuiroTron, ChimeOTron, SlinkOTron, SlimeOTron, CycloTron and MIDI Steering Wheel (for Joshua Fried). Many of these instruments were featured in his 2011 solo retrospective \\"Living in the Future.\\" Singer also designed and marketed a sensor and robotic interface board, MidiTron, to aid other artists in creating their own MIDI instruments. In Brooklyn, NY in 2000, Singer founded the pioneering musical robotics group LEMUR: League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots. Over the next decade, Singer led the group to create a large body of robotic musical instruments; produce performances with renowned musicians; present installations at well-known museums and galleries; and open LEMURplex, an early makerspace for performance, gallery shows, artist residencies, teaching and fabrication. LEMUR presented installations and performances throughout the world, at venues including Lincoln Center, the Whitney Museum, the National Gallery of Art and the Virgin Festival. LEMUR also collaborated with musicians and composers on live human/robot performances as well as solo works for LEMUR's instruments. Notable musicians and groups included pop artists They Might Be Giants, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, JG Thirlwell, Morton Subotnick, Ikue Mori and George Lewis. In 2009, Grammy-winning guitarist Pat Metheny commissioned LEMUR to build a large robotic orchestra, or orchestrion. This resulted in Metheny's 2010 Orchestrion album and world tour, with LEMUR instruments as his backing band. After to moving to Pittsburgh in 2009, Singer established as a solo artist under the name SingerBots and continues to do performances and large commissioned installations. In 2014, he was commissioned to create a robotic orchestra for the Lido Cabaret in Paris. The resulting 40+ piece orchestrion is featured nightly as the club's dinner band. In 2018, Singer built the SpiroPhone, a spiraling robotic xylophone sculpture that lives as a permanent installation in RoboWorld at the Carnegie Science Center. From 2012 to 2014, Singer consulted for Disney Imagineering on the Touche project to enable plants to play music in response to touch. Singer has also created software for generative music and algorithmic improvisation, including an animated improvising saxophone player at the NYU Media Research Lab in 1996 and a generative drum and percussion program for an installation at the Beall Center in 2005. In 2018, he appeared on WNYC's Science Friday to discuss the topic of computer improvisation in music.  Fire and Guerilla Arts  In 1997, Singer founded the New York City Burning Man Regional Association and served as the NYC regional contact for two years, organizing events and popularizing the festival in the New York area. Around the same time, Singer co-founded the influential Brooklyn arts combine The Madagascar Institute, with Chris Hackett and Ryan O'Connor Over the next decade, The Madagascar Institute would become known as a leading underground arts group with over 100 members, producing machine and fire art, expansive themed warehouse parties, guerilla street spectacles and theatrical events in abandoned urban buildings. In 2002, Singer lead a Madagascar Institute team to victory on The Learning Channel reality TV show Junkyard Wars. Singer has been involved in fire arts since the inception of the Madagascar Institute, creating pyrotechnic spectacles for many events and collaborating on a Pyrophone (MIDI-controlled flamethrower instrument). In 2000, he created Flaming Simon, a life-size fire-based version of the Simon electronic game. In 2008, he premiered PyroStomp, a walk-on step sequencer which controlled an eight cannon pyrophone. For the 2017 Roboexotica festival, he built a robot to create flaming cocktails. In Pittsburgh, Singer created and produced the Pyrotopia Festival of Fire Arts, first in 2012 and again in 2014. These large- scale outdoor events featured fire performers, art, games, installations, glass-blowing, forging and fire science demonstrations.  Performer  Singer has been a saxophonist since an early age. Throughout the 90s, he co-founded, performed in and recorded with a number of popular ska bands in Boston and New York, including Metro Stylee, The Allstonians, The Slackers, Stubborn All- Stars and Skinnerbox. He can be heard on commercially released recordings by these and other bands. Singer studied improv comedy in New York City at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and has studied and performed in Pittsburgh at the Arcade Comedy Theater, Unplanned Comedy and Steel City Improv Theater. He has formed and performed with a number of Pittsburgh long-form improv groups and duos. He is currently writing and performing in the sketch comedy duo The Problem with Pittsburgh comedian Ian Insect.  Medical Device Engineering  Since 2014, Singer has worked in the field of medical device engineering. From 2016 to 2018, Singer was part of Cerebroscope, a medical startup creating an experimental EEG device for monitoring cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) in stroke and TBI patients.

The species is found in North America and is most concentrated along the southern coast of California and in Mexico. D. mettleri are dependent on plant hosts, namely, the saguaro and cardon cacti. Thus, they are most prevalent in arid, desert conditions. It is able to detoxify chemicals found in the rotting liquid of cacti hosts, which allows it to use otherwise lethal soil as a nesting site. D. mettleri was discovered in San Felipe, Baja California in October 1961 during an experiment where banana was used to attract several species of Drosophila. Due to physical geographic barriers between Sonoran Desert flies, gene flow explains speciation. It breeds in soil moistened by liquid excreted by rotting cacti and on necrotic patches. The liquid found in rotting cacti patches serves as a nutrient source for D. mettleri larvae, despite it containing chemicals toxic to the intestines of other Dipterans. Several aspects of the fly species' courtship behavior, such as its courtship song and copulatory plugs, explain sexual selection methods in this fly. Description  = Differences between D. mettleri and D. nigrospiracula = Of the Sonoran Desert fly species, D. mettleri behaves, breeds, and is distributed most similarly to D. nigrospiracula. When D. mettleri are collected from cacti in prevalent geographic locations, they are isolated alongside D. nigrospiracula. Both species exploit the toxic sap of their host plants. However, unlike D. nigrospiracula, D. mettleri has a more efficient detoxification system that enables it to nest in areas not exploited by D. nigrospiracula. D. mettleri prefers to breed in soil moisturized in the sap of injured cacti, while D. nigrospiracula is found in the tissue of the cactus itself and is thus subjected to less concentrated toxin levels as compared to D. mettleri. An up- regulation in the genes encoding for xenobiotic resistance are attributed to the specialized and highly efficient detoxification ability of D. mettleri in comparison to other species. This enables the species to use a breeding ground otherwise lethal to both larvae and adults. =Feeding differences= D. nigrospiracula solely exploits cactus sap on the plant itself (i.e. in the tissues of the cacti). However, D. mettleri adults are located on both the cactus and in nearby soil, as the fly has the specialized ability to detoxify the highly concentrated sap found in surrounding soil. Females are more commonly located in their breeding ground (the soil), whereas males are situated in both areas. =Physical distinction= Phenotypic differences and similarities may be used to distinguish between D. mettleri and D. nigrospiracula. Similarities between these two species include large bodies, black carcasses, and thin, defined cheeks that stand in stark contrast to their elongated eyes. Differences between these two species that can be used to decipher between them include the following characteristics that D. mettleri has and D. nigrospiracula does not: toe extensions from the genital region, a frons pollinose that is angularly shaped like a \\"v\\", less maturated gonapophysics, and horns on the anterior only (no horns exist on the posterior region). The bristled texture of fly legs is pictured. Distribution = Distribution due to heat = The species is most commonly found in North American deserts, specifically, in Mexico and Arizona. The species is also found on the southern coast of California, where they inhabit prickly pears. Of the four species of Drosophila found in the Sonoran Desert, D. mettleri have the lowest heat tolerance. D. mettleri are abundant through all seasons but are less prevalent during the summer period. Because the necrotic tissue of cacti in the arid environment of the desert characterizes intense heat conditions, the ability of D. mettleri to exploit the nearby soil of the cacti for breeding purposes provides a selective advantage wherein the pupa of this species have a higher survival rate than other Drosophila desert species. Other species of Drosophila are less successful in the heat of the Sonoran Desert in rearing young due to the intense conditions. Their inability to burrow into the soil has been shown to prove detrimental in increasing pupa survival, yet D. mettleri has an evolutionary advantage in their ability to exploit a niche environment for breeding. The hypothesis that the necrotic tissue of cacti serves as a similarly protective environment as the soil of the Sonoran Desert for other species of Drosophila has been disproven. While other Drosophila have higher heat tolerances due to their breeding grounds in the necrotic tissue of cacti that is higher in heat, D. mettleri have a lower thermal tolerance because there is no evolutionary advantage to such heat tolerance (ability to exploit the less heat-exposed area of cacti soil). A species of Saguaro cactus, a key host species for D. mettleri. = Effects of geographic barriers = The geography of the area encompassed by the Sonoran Desert gives rise to genetic differentiation among desert Drosophila species who feed on necrotic rot. The Sonoran Desert incorporates the peninsular region of Baja California and mainland regions of California. After the peninsula was formed, the Gulf of California, which lies between the peninsula and the mainland, served as a barrier to dispersal opportunities in insects and land mammals. Another physical geographic barrier is the Gran Desierto de Alter, a large sand dune between the peninsula and the mainland. These physical geographic barriers are the cause of gene flow among Sonoran Desert flies. Studies of allozymes in D. mettleri and D. nigrospiracula show differences in nuclear markers that would otherwise suggest differentiation among the regions of the Sonoran Desert. In D. nigrospiracula, there were markers that showed differences within the species when they were located disparately among the peninsular and mainland regions of the desert. In D. mettleri, however, there were no such nuclear marker differences among members of the species found on the peninsula versus those found on the mainland. These differences show that deviations among D. mettleri can be supported through the stepping stone hypothesis. Each of the relatives of D. mettleri that are closest phylogenetically do not inhabit the Sonoran Desert region; therefore, the four species of Drosophila that do inhabit the Sonoran Desert region experienced parallel evolution instead of speciation within the desert. The species endemic to the Sonoran region, other than D. mettleri, are D. nigrospiracula, D. mojavensis, and D. melanogaster. The Sonoran Desert landscape shows the heavy dispersal of host cacti. Habitat =Host plants= The main host plants include the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), the cardon (Pachycereus pringlei), and the senita (Lophocereus schottii) cacti. D. mettleri is most commonly found in the saguaro and cardon cacti, in part for these cacti's larger size and cooler internal environments. In addition, these species of cacti release more exudant material into the soil; this enriched soil serves as a nesting site. The necrotic tissues of these cacti may also be used as feeding and nesting sites, yet the exploitation of the rot patches in these cacti is less common in D. mettleri in comparison to other desert Drosophila species. = Selection of host plant by rot patches = A characteristic pertinent to each of the Sonoran Desert Drosophila species is host cactus selection. Each of these flies chooses to exploit a different host plant for its resources (breeding, food). The selection of host cactus is important to the amount of resources available to each of these species and plays a role in the growth and development of the species. = Other factors leading to host selection = Each fly species exploits necrotic rot patches on the cactus for nutrients. The largest necrotic patch sizes rank in order from highest to lowest: cardon, saguaro, organpipe, and senita. The size and arm spans of the cacti did not influence the size of the necrotic patches. Instead of rot patch size being regulated by spatial factors, seasonal differences in the growth of the host plants determined how large and how abundant necrotic patches were. Further, temporal factors determined the amount of time a necrotic patch lasted; during the spring, patches are least abundant and during the summer, patches are most abundant. While all other species of the four Sonoran Desert Drosophila showed a correlation between the resource richness of their hosts‚Äô necrotic patches and population size, no such distinct correlation was found for D. mettleri. D. mettleri exploits both necrotic patches and soil near rotting cacti; further, this species can thrive on a variety of hosts, leading to more dispersal of these flies under a given spatial region. The overall development periods and availability of host cacti strongly affects the growth of both larvae and the reproductive success of adults. For larvae, optimal host conditions entail long-lived necrotic plots as this gives the larvae enough time to grow and develop into larger, more fit adults. For adults, adequate conditions include hosts that grow more regularly because adults will have a regular site to lay eggs. =Defense mechanism= The host cacti contain toxic chemicals and compounds that otherwise prevent flies from feeding on cacti. D. metlerri contains genes that enable it to detoxify these toxic compounds and thus feed off of the cacti as a source of nutrients. These genes are linked to the evolution of xenobiotic resistance. Life history The unique ability of D. mettleri to detoxify the high concentration of alkaloids present in the soil surrounding cacti with rot spots enables adult females to lay their eggs and sustain their larvae in the same nesting area. Other species of desert Drosophila that inhabit the same geographic region lack this ability and thus reduce the amount of competition females face in finding nesting sites. One species (D. majavensis) is composed of adults who cannot withstand the high alkaloid concentration in cacti soil unlike the larva that is only slightly sensitive. While this may encourage larval deposits to form in the soil, the inability of adult females to survive in these soil conditions prevents them from nesting in the soil, thus decreasing the amount of competition D. mettleri faces in finding appropriate nesting sites. Food resources = Rot material = Like other desert species of Drosophila, D. mettleri relies on the exudant juices of cacti as a feeding substrate. The juice found in the necrotic tissue of the cacti is also used as a feeding substrate when levels of exudates in the soil become low or scarce. = Yeast and bacteria = The area of the cactus often exploited by D. mettleri (when exudants are not extracted from soil) are \\"rot pockets\\". These pockets form when the cactus is injured; aggregates of bacteria and yeast conglomerate on the surface near the injury site and begin to form a pocket-like indent. The fermentation of the yeast and bacteria in this pocket serve as a \\"signal\\" to D. mettleri so that the site can be exploited for food. Communities of yeast on host species of D. mettleri have been isolated and serve to decompose the host cacti. During mating, both sexes of the fly gift each other yeast and bacteria. This mixture is then placed on breeding sites, later exposing larvae to natural florae necessary in increasing their fitness. Mating =Courtship behavior= The courtship behaviors of desert Drosophila of the Eremophila complex are similar. D. mettleri, belonging to this complex, begin courting as soon as they have their first intrasexual contact. Once the male brushes against a female, courting begins and the male begins to follow the female. The male initiates in courtship song through vibration of his wings. The male will choose to either follow a side of the female or follow behind her. Depending on the spot the male decides to occupy will determine the vibrational frequency of the male's wings. The farther the male is to the female, the shorter the wing pulses are. When the female stops moving, vibrational frequency increases. During this courtship song, the male may choose to lick the genitals of the female. If the female chooses to accept a male during his courting song, the female's wings will expand and the male will terminate his song. The flies will begin to copulate soon after. In comparison to other species in the Eremophila complex, males of D. mettleri are more likely to force copulation with females. =Courtship song= The courting song of D. mettleri is characterized by distinct vibrational pulses and frequencies. The more mobile a female is, the more irregular the vibrational pulses of the male will be. To initiate the courting song, a male will extend his wings seventy-eighty degrees and release a few short pulses. After the initiation process, more regular pulses are released by males. = Male-female controls = In D. mettleri, after the male inserts his sperm (i.e. ejaculates) into his mate, swelling of the vaginal wall occurs. This may serve as a copulatory plug that serves as a defense against other males copulating and having offspring with the female. The male is then enabled to ensure his own paternity. This is an adaptation by the males of D. mettleri, as females of this species re-mate many times and will selectively fertilize her eggs. The copulatory plug has been shown to ensure paternity of the father, but there is no evidence of this plug serving any selection purposes. 6‚Äì8 hours after the insemination process occurs, a female will get rid of any excess sperm and the material that was used as a copulatory plug by her mate. This shows that both the male and females in the relationship have control over the sexual behaviors and outcomes of the opposite sex. A sketch shows the reproductive architecture in a female fly.  Ejaculation material  The ejaculate material from the male serves a larger purpose than acting as a copulatory plug. The fluid may serve as a source of nutrients, and can also affect the time it takes for sperm activation to occur as well as the time of oviposition. The nutrients found in this fluid have been shown to increase egg size and to increase the quantity of eggs laid by the female (depending on the nutrient density of the fluid). Thus, the quality of this fluid limits or increases the female's reproductive success. The amount of fluid a male will contribute during a mating is dependent on the species of the Sonoran Desert drosophila. In D. mettleri, males make large ejaculatory investments when mating, and thus the male's fluid quality plays a large role in the development of the larvae. = Ejaculation nutrients' role in monogamy = The costs of having only one reproductive partner due to effects of the plug must be outweighed by the nutrient benefits gained by the ejaculated material. The cost to benefit trade-off is dependent upon resource availability and is highly regulated by the distribution and growth of rot material. In D. mettleri, there has been an evolutionary drive toward greater reproductive success of males donating the best quality and quantity of fluid. Radio-labeling was used to measure the amount of fluid incorporated into female egg production (and thus not removed from the body after 6‚Äì8 hours). They found that females with the largest vaginal swellings incorporated the highest amount of sperm from a single male partner than did females who had smaller vaginal swellings (and thus had the option to re-mate). Other Dipterans who do not have females undergoing an insemination process were also observed; no radio-labeled material was found in the eggs of these females, showing that the insemination process characteristic of D. mettleri and other Desert Drosophila is essential in male paternity assurance. = Not all are monogamous = A study published in 2012 did extensive research into the reproductive biology of D. mettleri and correlating information to its reproductive behaviors. Male flies mature more quickly than female flies do, but the study showed this is not the pivotal factor in why many wild females either lack sperm or exploit sperm sources too quickly once inseminated. The researchers concluded that the quick cycling of sperm in females explains why there may be frequent remating in this species both in the lab and in nature. The study also found that there were no consequences to life spans of females that had remated more than other females. In fact, a few benefits to multiple mating for females include greater female postcopulatory control of sperm and greater success of offspring. Parental care =Oviposition= As necrotrophs, these flies are known to lay their eggs in the rotting refuse of dying cacti. In comparison to other necrotrophs in the desert, D. metlerri prefers to breed in soils entrenched in the liquid of these rotting cacti rather than breeding in the tissues of cacti that contain these juices. The significance of this behavior is that the arid conditions of the desert lead to extreme water loss in the cacti, and resulting liquid toxins trailing into nearby soil is concentrated to a magnitude other nectrotrophs cannot detoxify. Thus, the detoxification capacity of D. metlerri enables it to breed in a niche environment not exploited commonly by other species. The specialized detoxification abilities of D. mettleri have been tested in order to see if host-plant shifts would lead to changes on the genetic level in future offspring of flies exploiting cacti with different chemical compositions than those of their typical host cacti (senita and saguaro). Future generations showed transcriptional changes in genes triggering different metabolic pathways better equipped to detoxify the variant chemical environment of their host-cacti. Enemies =Parasites= Drosophila species, including D. mettleri and others in its phylogenetic lineage, show predatory pressure by ectoparasistic mites that live in the necrotic rotting spots on desert cacti. When D. mettleri feeds on these rots or breeds in these areas, they are parasitized by these mites which reduce their lifespans and hinder their reproduction abilities.  Genetics  The diagram provides a visual of the CYP Gene superfamily and its evolutionary divergence. = P450 gene family and upregulation of CYP28A1 gene = To exploit the rotting liquid refuse of dying cacti, D. metlerri has been found to contain mutations leading to evolutionary adaptations. These mutations are thought to be the reason for the fly's xenobiotic resistance. Three families of genes, which include P450s, esterases, and glutathione s-transferases, contain the specific genes known to regulate the detoxification abilities of insects. The CYP28A1 gene has been isolated in lines of dipterans in the metlerri lineage and is upregulated in these flies. The upregulation of this gene is an adaptive response to exposure to toxic alkaloids in host plants. Similarly, the Cyp 28A1 gene expression is also upregulated in D. mettleri that are exposed to more alkaloids in host plants. The P450 family of genes have a protein structure that can be highly altered by few mutations and sequence changes. A site in the Cyp 28A1 gene has a single change from a nonpolar to polar amino acid. This alteration is enough to lead to an up-regulation in gene expression causing a significant change in physical protein structure; the consequence is increased detoxification of toxins in host plants within the D. mettleri tested. = Genetic isolation between species = A new model studies genetic isolation between species of cactophillic Diptera (D. mettleri and D. mojavensis) on the Catalina Islands off the Californian coast. The flies of these species have switched host plants to prickly pear cacti on these islands, and genetic differences have also been isolated in these flies. After comparing the genotypes of these species on the Catalina islands to other flies that use prickly pear cacti as their hosts, haplotype relationships among D. mettleri and D. mojavensis were found. In conclusion, the study found that the geographical barrier of the San Pedro Channel found between the Catalina Islands caused genetic isolation and that there was ecological factors that lead to genetic differences in those flies of D. mettleri and D. mojavensis feeding on prickly pear on the Catalina islands.  Physiology  =Thermoregulation= Different species of Drosophila will exploit different species of cacti; the host species regularly inhabited by D. mettleri has been shown to determine the thermotolerance differences within this species of fly, despite their geographical dispersal overlap. Species of cacti that are larger and store more water, like the cardon and saguaro cactus, are able to retain cooler internal temperatures during periods of intense heat. Species like the senita are smaller and carry less water; they are prone to reaching higher temperatures in arid climates. D. mettleri is found most commonly near saguaro and senita cacti, characterizing their lower heat tolerance levels than other species of desert Drosophila. The differences in species distribution among host cacti is linked to the physiological differences in the flies on the basis of their detoxification efficiency of the toxins naturally found in the varying cacti species. D. mettleri contains the transcriptional changes needed to detoxify the more cool and temperate environment of the saguaro and cardon cactus. Over time, less necessity to inhabit hotter cacti reduced the genes selecting for higher heat tolerance. Mutualism = Host rot plot exploitation = Other species of desert Drosophila can exploit the substrates of the desert cacti species saguaro and cardon. D. mettleri is one of two species of nine that can use the juices of the senita cactus as food. Alkaloids in cacti are highly toxic to most Drosophila and to the development of larva. Components leading to the toxicity of desert cacti include medium fatty acid chains, dihydroxy sterols, and senita alkaloids. Some species of Drosophila can withstand these chemical conditions within the cacti when breeding but at the consequence of the survival of larvae. D. mettleri is one of two species where the toxicity of the cacti (specifically the senita) does not reduce the survival rates of larvae and pupa, and has little effect on the mother's survival. = Mutualism role in nesting area choice = Despite the distinct ability of D. mettleri to breed successfully in both the necrotic tissue of desert cacti and soil moisturized with the exudates of rotting cacti, the species has a behavioral preference to breed in the soil habitat where conditions are cooler and where there is less predatory pressure.

British policy toward Mihailoviƒá was shaped by reports of Bailey who was one of the most responsible for wrecking the position of Mihailoviƒá and Chetniks with British and consequently Allied side. The Chetniks followed requests of Allied command sent before the offensive against Rommel in Africa and organized a campaign against Axis communications through German occupied Serbia and further to Thessaloniki and Libya. Bailey reinforced British missions with Chetniks with well trained military sappers to help Chetniks to be more effective in sabotaging German lines of communications. The campaign of Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks against Axis communications was probably instrumental in the victory of the Allies against Rommel in Africa. The British command praised Mihailoviƒá for this successes while Hitler blamed Chetniks in Serbia for his defeats in Africa and at the beginning of 1943 issued an order for complete annihilation of all Chetnik forces. When the crisis of Allied forces in Africa had passed the Chetniks assumed a policy of tactical inactivity which was criticized by the British command. In order to convince Mihailoviƒá that the British could \\"make him or break him\\" Bailey proposed a new firm position of the British side toward Mihailoviƒá and his Chetniks.:\\" Bailey informed Cairo that \\"the time has come to treat Mihailovic firmly. He must be made to realise that we can make him or break him....\\" Just how the British were to convince Mihailovich that they could \\"make him or break him\\". Bailey offered Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá the position of Chetnik leader and to replace Mihailoviƒá, which ƒêuri≈°iƒá refused. Mihailoviƒá launched a campaign against Axis positions in Eastern Bosnia in October 1943 inflicting hundreds of casualties on Axis forces and liberating Vi≈°egrad, Rogatica and many other places, and the British media attributed all those Chetnik victories against Axis to rival Communist forces. Bailey prevented Chetniks from disarming the Italian Venezia division after the capitulation of Italy and organized capture of their arms by communists who used it to push Chetniks out of the valley of river Lim. Bailey left Chetnik HQ on 29 January 1944 after first refusing an American proposal to leave at least one member of their missions at Mihailoviƒá HQ.  Early life  Bailey completed Emmanuel School in Wandsworth. Before the World War II Bailey lived in Kingdom of Yugoslavia for some time when he was engineer in Trepƒça Mines and fluently spoke Serbian language. During the World War I Bailey was a member of British SOE team in Athens, Greece when the king of Greece was removed and pro-Allied Venizelist government installed.  World War II  When he returned from a mission in Canada, Bailey was parachuted into Mihailoviƒá's HQ on 25 December 1942.: \\"Meanwhile Bailey, having returned from his recruiting mission to Canada, had been parachuted to Mihailoviƒá's headquarters on Christmas Eve 1942\\" The chief of Bailey's staff in Chetnik HQ was Major Kenneth Greenlees.:\\"Col.

During 1943 a number of British military missions were sent to various Chetnik corps in Serbia. Bailey reported that Mihailoviƒá had overwhelming support of people in Serbia while strength of Communists there was negligible. Mihailoviƒá gave code name Milo≈° to Bailey, as association to Kosovo where Bailey lived for longer period during his service in Yugoslavia, or to Serb hero of Battle of Kosovo Milo≈° Obiliƒá.:\\"–î—Ä–∞–∂–∞ –º—É —ò–µ –¥–∞–æ —Å–∏–º–±–æ–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ –∏–º–µ –ú–∏–ª–æ—à, —à—Ç–æ —ò–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±–∞–ª–æ –¥–∞ –∞—Å–æ—Ü–∏—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞ –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–æ, –≥–¥–µ —ò–µ –ë–µ—ò–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–æ –¥—É–∂–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ –∑–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ —Å–≤–æ—ò–µ —Å–ª—É–∂–±–µ —É –à—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—ò–∏, –æ–¥–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥ —ò—É–Ω–∞–∫–∞ –ú–∏–ª–æ—à–∞ –û–±–∏–ª–∏—õ–∞. \\" = Crisis in Africa = The British General Harold Alexander sent personal telegram to Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá before the offensive against Rommel in Africa, requesting him to organize a large-scale campaign against Axis lines of communication in order to obstruct transport of German war material through Serbia to Thessaloniki and further to Libya. In May 1942 Mihailoviƒá demanded heavy explosives from the British command to be used for destruction of the German supply lines running through Serbia and Aegean to North Africa German troops.:\\"Mihailoviƒá ... requested from the British Middle East command heavy explosives for the purpose of destroying the German supply lines running south to the Aegean for Rommel's troops in North Africa.\\" To support Western Desert campaign Chetniks organized a campaign against communications of Axis through German occupied Serbia. This campaign was witnessed by Hudson.:\\"The campaign against Axis communications had been witnessed by Colonel William Hudson, who at that time was the sole British officer attached to Mihailovich.\\" On 1 December 1942 Mihalovic received a greeting from the Chief of the British Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke who expressed his felicitations for the wonderful undertaking of the Yugoslav Army.

Despite lacking formal military training, Tatya Tope is widely considered as the best and most effective rebel general. Born as Ramachandra Panduranga Yawalkar to a Marathi Deshastha Brahmin family, in Yeola, (near Nasik). Tatya (Tantia) took on the title Tope, meaning commanding officer. His first name Tantia means General. A personal adherent of Nana Saheb of Bithur, he progressed with the Gwalior contingent after the British reoccupied Kanpur (then known as Cawnpore) and forced General Windham to retreat from the city. Later on, Tatya Tope came to the relief of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi and with her seized the city of Gwalior. However, he was defeated by General Napier's British Indian troops at Ranod and after a further defeat at Sikar, he abandoned the campaign.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books; pp. 132-34 According to an official statement, Tatya Tope's father was Panduranga, an inhabitant of Jola Pargannah, Patoda Zilla Nagar, in present-day Maharashtra. Tope was a Mara·π≠ha Vashista Brahman by birth. In a government letter, he was said to be the minister of Baroda, while he was held identical to Nana Saheb in another communication. A witness at his trial described Tantia Tope as \\"a man of middling stature, with a wheat complexion and always wearing a white chukri- dar turban\\". Tatya Tope was executed by the British Government at Shivpuri on 18April 1859. Initial engagement at the Indian rebellion of 1857 After the rebellion in Cawnpore (Kanpur) broke out on 5 June 1857, Nana Saheb became the leader of the rebels. As the British forces surrendered on 25 June 1857, Nana was declared Peshwa in late June. General Havelock twice faced Nana's forces in a battle before the latter were finally defeated at the their third encounter. After the defeat, Nana's troops had to withdraw to Bithur, after which Havelock crossed the Ganges and retreated to Awadh. Tatya Tope began to act in Nana Saheb's name from Bithur. Tatya Tope was one of the leaders of the massacre of Cawnpore, which occurred on June 27, 1857. Afterwards, Tope held a good defensive position until he was driven out by the British force led again by Sir Henry Havelock on August 16, 1857. Afterward, he defeated General Charles Ash Windham at Cawnpore II, which started on November 27, 1857 and continued for two days. However, Tope and his army were later defeated at Cawnpore III, when the British counterattacked under Sir Colin Campbell. Tope and other rebels fled the scene and had to take shelter at the Rani of Jhansi, while aiding her as well. Clash with Colonel Holmes Later on Tatya and Rao Saheb, after assisting Jhansi during the British assault successfully helped Rani Lakshmibai escape the attack. Together with Rani Lakshmibai, they took control of Gwalior Fort declaring Hindavi Swaraj (Free Kingdom) under the name of Nana Saheb Peshwa from Gwalior. After losing Gwalior to the British, Tope and Rao Saheb, nephew of Nana Saheb, fled to the Rajputana. He was able to induce the army of Tonk to join him. Tope was unable to enter the town of Bundi though, and while announcing he would go south, he headed west in reality and towards Nimach. A British flying column commanded by Colonel Holmes was in pursuit of him, while the British commander in Rajputana, General Abraham Robert was able to attack the rebel force when they had reached a position between Sanganer and Bhilwara. Tope again fled from the field towards Udaipur and, after visiting a Hindu shrine on 13 August, he drew up his forces on the Banas River. They were defeated again by Roberts's forces and Tope fled again. He crossed the Chambal River and reached the town of Jhalrapatan in the state of Jhalawar. Continued resistance Even after the Revolt of 1857 was put down by the British, Tatya Tope continued resistance as a guerrilla fighter in the jungles. He induced the state forces to rebel against the Raja and was able to replace the artillery he had lost at the Banas River. Tope then took his forces towards Indore, but was pursued by the British, now commanded by General John Michel as he fled towards Sironj. Tope, accompanied by Rao Saheb, decided to divide their combined forces so that he could make his way to Chanderi with a bigger force, and Rao Saheb, on the other hand, with a smaller force to Jhansi. However, they combined again in October and suffered yet another defeat at Chhota Udaipur. By January 1859, they arrived to the state of Jaipur and experienced two more defeats. Tope then escaped alone into the jungles of Paron. At this point, he met Man Singh, Raja of Narwar, and his household and decided to stay with at his court. Man Singh was in dispute with the Maharaja of Gwalior while the British were successful in negotiating with him to hand Tope to them in return for his life and protection of his family from any reprisals by the Maharaja. After this event, Tope was handed to the British and left to face his fate at the hand of the British.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year. London: Sphere Books; pp. 129-35 Execution Tatya Tope admitted the charges brought before him, but noted that he might be held accountable only before his master, the Peshwa. He was executed at the gallows on 18 April 1859 in Shivpuri.

The No to Oppression against Women Initiative protested against the men-only composition of the commission. Background The Khartoum massacre took place on 3 June 2019 in the context of the Sudanese Revolution against a protestors' sit-in in Khartoum. The massacre of 118 civilians and the rape of 70 women and men is generally attributed to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), under the leadership of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (\\"Hemetti\\"). The rapes were documented as a deliberate campaign to \\"break the girls\\" according to France 24. The results of three different enquiries were released in late July 2019. On 27 July, Fathelrahman Saeed, the head of a committee appointed by the Attorney-General at the request of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) to investigate the massacre, stated that 87 people had been killed, 168 injured, no rapes had occurred and no tents had been burnt. Saeed stated that legal cases for crimes against humanity had been launched against eight unnamed high-ranking security officers. The report was considered \\"poor and defective\\" by citizens' groups. The Darfur Bar Association (DBA) released its own report on 30 July, stating that eight rape victims were receiving psychological therapy; one in Omdurman had committed suicide as a result of the rape; one rape victim had been forced by social stigma to search for another home for her and her family. The DBA claimed that it had \\"ample evidence\\" of responsibility of the TMC for the massacre and that the \\"decision to disband the sit-in\\" took place at a meeting including all TMC members, the Attorney-General, police chiefs and security directors. The third report was that of a committee created by the National Umma Party and led by Yousef El Amin. On 30 July, El Amin stated that the sit-in was disbanded by \\"a large military force wearing RSF uniforms and riot police\\" and that the massacre had been \\"premeditated and planned\\". He stated that 47 victims of the massacre died on 3 June, with a total of 124 dying from 3 to 20 June. He confirmed rapes, throwing of bodies into the Nile, and burning of tents. Legal constraints The 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration refers to the investigation in Article 7.(16) as an element of the \\"Mandate of the Transitional Period\\", defining the scope as \\"violations committed on 3 June 2019, and events and incidents where violations of the rights and dignity of civilian and military citizens were committed.\\" The investigation committee is to be created under an \\"order\\" that \\"guarantees that it will be independent and possess full powers to investigate and determine the timeframe for its activities\\". Article 21 of the Draft Constitutional Declaration gives \\"procedural\\" immunity to members of the Sovereignty Council, the Cabinet, the Transitional Legislative Council, governors of provinces and heads of regions, with Article 21.(2) giving the Transitional Legislative Council the right to lift that immunity by a simple majority. Commission On 21 September 2019, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok issued a decision to create the primary investigation commission of seven lawyers, including a Supreme Court judge, representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Defence and Interior, a \\"national figure\\" and two independent lawyers. The decision guaranteed that the committee would operate independently of any other governmental, judicial or legal body. The commission will be required to release a report with its findings within three months and can extend its mandate for another three months. Hamdok named the members of the commission on 20 October, with Nabil Adib as the head of the commission. The other commission members are Osman Mohamed Osman as rapporteur, Sohaib Abdullatif as deputy rapporteur, colonel Ismat Abdalla Mohamed Taha and Ahmed El Taher El Nur and two unnamed members. =Men-only commission= Ihsan Fagiri of the No to Oppression against Women Initiative protested on 22 October 2019 against the men-only nature of the commission. She stated that women should participate as commission members, since many women had been killed, raped or thrown dead into the Nile and three women rape victims had committed suicide after the massacre. Missing persons committee On 23 September, the Attorney-General Abdallah Ahmed Abdallah created a committee of prosecutors and \\"representatives of the Bar Association, the police, the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Justice, and the Unit to combat violence against women\\" to investigate the disappearances of the people who remained missing after the Khartoum massacre and provide a report within two months. On 14 September, the citizens' group \\"Missing\\" listed 21 people missing.

Life She was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1885. Her parents William Francis Moore and Georgette Robinson were Canadian and took her back to Canada. She grew up in Cookstown and Dundas, Ontario. Jamieson attended Hamilton (Ontario) Model School and got training in domestic science. She became a teacher, following in her father's line of work. But she worked for several years before getting her qualifications from the Winnipeg Normal school. She was known as Pat to her family and friends. On 23 October 1907 Jamieson married farmer Norman Jamieson and they had four children. She worked for the Ontario Department of Agriculture. Jamieson spent time lecturing to Women's Institutes and the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire. During the First World War, encouraged by her mother and husband, Jamieson began to send her work to The Mail and Empire. She was soon a regular journalist working on a column for them. She also contributed to Business Woman, Family Herald, Montreal Weekly Star, Ontario Farmer and Toronto Star Weekly. She managed to publish two volumes of verses and sketches, one before she died, one was arranged by family and friends after her death. Her final book, The Golden Shackle was never published.

The Basilica del Santo Crucifix is a 1444-1447 bronze sculpture by Donatello on the high altar of the basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova in Padua. It measures 180 by 166 cm - his only monumental bronze on that scale prior to that date had been his 1423-1425 Saint Louis of Toulouse. The work was originally nude, with a textile loincloth probably intended to be added - the current bronze one is a Baroque addition. The work also marks a development away from the exaggerated realism of his youthful Santa Croce Crucifix. Probably the artist's first important commission in Padua, it may have even have been the offer of producing this work in bronze (a difficult and costly material) which tempted him to leave Florence for Padua in 1443. He acquired the wax for its modello in 1444 and the work was first displayed in the basilica in 1447, with Donatello paid the last installment of his fee in 1449. He was working on the fencing for the choir at the same time and so the crucifix was probably originally intended for the centre of that space rather than the high altar. It does not form part of the artist's 1446-1450 scheme of reliefs for that altar, though it was so highly prized by the monks that it probably gained him that later commission.Rolf C.

He is the Elizabeth and Edward Conner Professor of Education and Affiliated Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.  Education and career  Schoenfeld was raised in New York City, studying at Queen's College (BA 1968) before moving to Stanford for research in pure mathematics (MS 1969, Ph.D 1973 on topology and measure theory). During his graduate studies he became increasingly interested in the teaching and learning of mathematics, particularly of non-routine problem solving. He taught at UC Davis (1973‚Äì5), UC Berkeley (1975‚Äì78), Hamilton College (1978‚Äì81) and the University of Rochester (1981‚Äì1985) before moving back to Berkeley where he now works.  Research  Schoenfeld's work ranges widely across thinking, teaching, and learning in mathematics and beyond, with particular interest in methodological issues aimed at improving the effectiveness of educational research. He has written, edited, or co-edited twenty-two books and more than two hundred articles on thinking and learning. He has focused successively on three major areas: On problem solving. He made an empirical study of how far mathematics undergraduates tackling non-routine problems can use the strategies set out in George Polya's seminal work How to solve it (1945) The strategies were based on Polya's reflections on how he solved problems. Schoenfeld's study found that the strategies alone are weak, and need to be strengthened by complementary domain-specific tactics. He also showed the importance of students' monitoring their work on a problem and adjusting their tactical and technical moves accordingly. This work was published as Mathematical Problem Solving (1985). On models of teaching. Understanding the decisions that teachers make in real time in the classroom then became a focus. From the analysis in great detail of videos of mathematics lessons, he and his collaborators developed a model of teaching emphasising three key dimensions ‚Äì the teacher's knowledge, goals and the beliefs about mathematics. He later generalized the work to real time decision making by professionals, published as the book How we think (2010). On improving classrooms. Since the 1990s Schoenfeld has become increasingly focused on the challenges of translating research insights into tools and processes that improve teaching and learning in real world classrooms. Working with the design team at the Shell Centre for Mathematical Education. in Nottingham, he has led projects to develop tools for teaching and assessment, culminating in the Mathematics Assessment Project. Complementing this he developed a theoretical framework, Teaching for Robust Understanding (TRU), a model of classrooms in which productive learning is likely to occur. This identifies five key dimensions: the Mathematics; Cognitive demand; Access; Agency, authority and identity; Formative assessment.

It is in the Cappella Bardi di Vernio just off the left transept of Santa Croce in Florence, Italy. History According to the Book of Antonio Billi (a manuscript in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze), quoted and added to in Vasari's Lives of the Artists, the work was originally in the church's cappella Barbigia. There it was criticised by Donatello's friend Filippo Brunelleschi (who had gone with him to Rome) as showing a \\"contadino\\" (farmer) on a cross, that is for its exaggerated realism. This spurred Brunelleschi to produce for Santa Maria Novella in c.1410-1415 his own crucifix - Donatello's first sight of that work made him drop the eggs he was carrying. Anonimo Magliabechiano also attributes the work to Donatello, as does Vasari in a letter to Matteo Benvenuti dated 29 December 1571 recording its move to its present chapel. A few art historians have disputed this attribution and instead assigned the work to Nanni di Banco or another sculptor. Johnson identifies the work in Billi, Magliabechiano and Vasari with the crucifix at the Bosco ai Frati Monastery, but that work is now generally considered to date to between 1450 and 1499 instead.

Early life Cook was born in Bournemouth, Dorset on 4 January 1967.  Career  Cook was a jet engine technician in the Royal Air Force from 1983 to 1991. She served on Tornado aircraft and in 1985, at the age of 18, saved the life of a colleague following an explosion on an aircraft. After spending most of the 1990s in Saudi Arabia, she returned to the UK in 1998 where she became a photographer with a varied portfolio, including stints as club photographer at AFC Bournemouth and a long connection to Peter Doherty and The Libertines. Cook used her profile to speak out against the stigma surrounding mental health and bigotry, including an appearance at TEDx Brighton in 2018. She became a news anchor and TV chat show host for Latest TV in Brighton, becoming the first transgender newscaster in Europe. Her autobiography, Not Today: How I Chose Life, was released in 2018 as a self-help book for those struggling with mental health or identity.  Political career  In 2017, Cook stood as the Labour general election candidate in East Worthing and Shoreham, where she came second with 39.3% of the vote. Supported by the activist group Momentum and trade union Unite the Union, she sought the Labour Party's nomination to stand again in the 2019 general election. She was removed from the shortlist over questions about the bankruptcy of a previous company she ran, but the process was stopped after the other two candidates withdrew in protest. The selection began again with Cook on the shortlist, but she wasn't selected. She stood as an independent candidate instead, but withdrew from active campaigning, citing harassment that she was receiving and its effect on her mental health as the reason for doing so. In 2019, she set up the Sophie Cook Foundation in order to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health in schools, colleges and universities.  Personal life  Cook is a transgender woman, and began to transition in 1998. Having struggled with her gender identity from childhood and with her mental health, notably posttraumatic stress disorder, self harming and suicidal ideation both during and after her military service, Cook transitioned in July 2015 while working at AFC Bournemouth. In doing so, she became the first transgender person to work in Premier League football.  Honours  Cook was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bournemouth University for her work raising awareness of mental health issues in November 2019, and invited to become a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 2020.

The second album is called Wild Child and the backing band is primarily members of Toto. This is everlasting greatness done perfectly.\\" Echoes in the Wind Archives says of the album, \\"So what to make of Just A Stone's Throw Away? Well, like a lot of the records that were coming out of L.A. at the time, it can be a little too slick at moments.

Originally opened in 1866 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, the depot was rebuilt in 1890, 1945 and lastly in 1948 when it was under British Railways ownership. It was closed to all traffic in 1967, being one of the last steam sheds in the Leeds and Bradford area. History The first depot to serve the needs of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) in southern Bradford, was opened in 1850 near to the Drake Street (later Exchange) railway station. This was soon replaced by a new engine shed at Low Moor, which later become an important railway junction. Bradford was directly to the north, the Great Northern Railway's Bradford avoiding line via (and the line to Wakefield) to the east, with Halifax to the south, and the Spen Valley Line to the south east. The depot at Low Moor was opened by the LYR in 1866 and was located to the northern side of Low Moor railway station. This had replaced an earlier structure built in the 1860s which was nearer the tunnel mouth. The engine shed was subject to alterations in size and structure in 1890 and 1945, by the LYR and London Midland and Scottish Railway respectively. During the First World War, many of the traditional male-orientated jobs were being undertaken by women due to most of the shed's able bodied men volunteering for war work. In the 1940s, the shed had a turntable at the northern end, and twelve roads inside the shed, with access to the depot only from the northern end. By the 1960s, twelve roads still ran into the shed area, but the six most western lines had the overall roofing removed by then. As the drawdown of steam took place in the late 1960s, steam engines from the Leeds and Bradford area were sent to Low Moor as they were either supplanted by diesels or their steam depot closed down. Moving engines to Low Moor had been going on since the early 1960s; just before their withdrawal, the shed was allocated four Royal Scot 4-6-0s after they were no longer needed for Settle and Carlisle workings. Originally, the depot had been designated as Shed No. 2 under the LYR. It was coded as 25F between 1948 and 1956, then 56F from 1956 until its closure. The 56X code determined that Low Moor was a sub-shed of 56A at Wakefield. Allocations *1933 - 65 steam engines *1950 - 37 steam engines *1955 - 31 steam engines *1962 - 50 steam engines *1966 - 14 steam engines *1967 - 12 steam engines Closure Closure of the shed came in October 1967. Low Moor was the last surviving steam shed in the Bradford area. After closure, the site was earmarked for a Freightliner intermodal terminal, though this came to nothing, and all the lines were removed.

Its initial purpose was as an asset management company. The holdings were that of James Ludington, a lumber baron. The business firm was the cradle for the development of the city of Ludington, Michigan. The company was an important component of the lumber boom and bust in the area, supplying lumber for hundreds of thousands of homes and other structures in the Midwest. It was one of the largest producers of salt in the state of Michigan. The company was active from 1869 to 1897 and later sold.  Background  James Ludington Ludington's holdings contained in part 360 acres that included the lots of the village of Pere Marquette in Mason County in the northwestern part of Michigan in its lower peninsula. The village lots were sold out to individuals and became the core of a town that in 1873 would become the city of Ludington. The city became the terminus of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad that ultimately became a railway line to Wisconsin via carferries across Lake Michigan. This became the home port of the largest carferry fleet in the world. The village's sawmill was also owned by Ludington. It was the oldest sawmill in northwestern Michigan and had been operating since 1848. The sawmill had been owned by different men until 1859 when it became the property of Ludington through a foreclosure. In addition, he owned a parcel of land of 25,000 acres that contained white pine timber that could be turned into lumber for construction. The parcel was situated on the Pere Marquette River in Mason County, Lake County, Newaygo County, and Oceana County in northwestern Michigan near the village of Pere Marquette.  History  Advertisement in city directory - 1883 Ludington had failing health in the late 1860s and felt he could no longer manage his vast holdings in Michigan. The Pere Marquette Lumber Company was then formed to buy his holdings to take over the management. The new lumber company arrangement came under the guidance of Delos L. Filer. Ludington's holdings were bought out by the new lumber company with $500,000 cash. It was officially organized on July 24, 1869. The members of the new company were Ludington, Filer, John Mason Loomis, Edward A. Foster and Luther H. Foster. The officers of the new company were Filer as president, Loomis as treasurer, with L. H. Foster and James Ludington as secretaries. The stock of the new lumber company was divided up proportionally when they pooled together the money to buy out Ludington's holdings. Ludington had built a large commercial store in the village of Pere Marquette built in 1867 called The Big Store. The store sold all kinds of general merchandise to the public. For years it was the largest retailer for Mason County. It advertised with the slogan \\"Large sales and small profits.\\" The second story of the building was used for the offices of the lumber company and from time to time as a church and public library. The sawmills of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company consisted originally of the basic saws of the time when first operated in the 1870s. The mills manufactured about three to four million board feet (FBM) of lumber yearly. The company gradually improved and updated the machinery of their sawmills as time went on to the latest equipment. The sawmills were capable of producing 10,000,000 board feet per year by 1880. Later more improvements were added to their sawmills so that 12 to 15 million FBM per year could be produced. The company branched out into the salt business in 1883. At that time the new salt business division started boring a well for a salt bed. The salt enterprise was successful in 1885 when it had drilled a well 2,220 feet deep. The lumber company used leftover timber from their sawmills in its production for burning to distill salt from the brine brought up from the drilled well. The salt enterprise had the capability to produce about four hundred barrels of salt per day when first started producing salt in 1885. The salt division produced about 90,000 barrels of salt annually by 1898. The grades of salt produced were No. 1 fine grade, and packers' salt. The company ranked among the largest salt and lumber producers in the state of Michigan by 1890. These were important industries to develop out the city of Ludington. The Pere Marquette Lumber Company ceased operating in 1897 when its timber supply was used up. The company was sold to the Michigan Salt Association in 1900. This company should not be confused with the Pere Marquette Lumber and Boom Company. Legacy The Michigan State University Archives and Historical Collections holds three cubic feet in 17 binders of the company's records.

He won the World Amateur Billiards Championship title twice, in 1952 and 1967; and the Billiards and Snooker Control Council version of the world professional championship, played on a challenge basis, in 1971 and 1973.  Early Career and English Amateur Championship Title Driffield started playing billiards aged 12, and was making breaks by 13. His day job was as an executive at an Ellerby Foundry Ltd in Leeds, where his father was chairman. He learnt on a 6x3 foot table at home, then played and practised at the YMCA for 23 years, before winning his first English Amateur Championship title. He was coached by George Nelson, and won the Yorkshire Championship in 1937, 1938, 1950, and 1951, and the Leeds Championship in 1949. In the 1952 English Amateur Championship final against Herbert Beetham, a mineral water manufacturer, Driffield was 98 points behind when his came off and he had to use his reserve cue. In his first six using the reserve cue he scored a total of only 31 points, compared to his average score per visit of 36.4 in the previous session. Beetham increased his lead to 271, but Driffield fought back, with the help of a 142 break, to be 174 behind at the end of that session. At the end of the match, Driffield was the victor by 101 points, 2,894‚Äì2,793.  World Amateur Championship  Following an appeal by the Billiards and Snooker Control Council for funds to send Driffield to Calcutta for the 1952 world championship, he travelled to India a couple of weeks before the competition began. He was the only player in the competition to win all of his matches, netting 8,538 points for, and 4,254 against, and took the title. Before leaving India, he won all-India Billiards Championship, beating fellow world championship competitor Walter Ramage of Scotland 3002-2256, and also won the all-India snooker championship. He left the original trophies in India because of the possible customs problems involved in returning them, and took replica trophies back to the United Kingdom. Between winning the English and World titles, Driffield lost his Yorkshire title that he had been attempting to defend. In 1958, having won further English Amateur titles, Driffield was the world championship runner-up to Wilson Jones. Following his English Amateur title victory in 1967 Driffield played at the 1967 world championship in Colombo and was, as in 1952, the only unbeaten player, and the champion.  BA&CC; World Title and WPBSA breakaway  Driffield was a member of the Billiards Association and Control Council, and was present at the meeting where he the Council nominated him as the challenger to Rex Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the B&SCC; Council had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Jack Karnehm. Driffield beat Karnehm 9,029‚Äì4,342 in June 1971, in a match not recognised by most professional players. Meanwhile, on 12 December 1970, the Professional Billiard Players Association, which had been reestablished in 1968 Williams and seven other players, changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion.

The impetus for this enterprise came from the geologist and explorer Otto Nordenskj√∂ld, who had led the 1901‚Äì03 Swedish Antarctic Expedition He wished to continue and extend the work begun there. The British involvement in the new venture arose because Nordenskj√∂ld planned to finance it from the profits of a whaling company which he proposed to set up. For this, he needed to obtain a licence from the British authorities, who controlled all whaling activities in the sector of the Antarctic in which Nordenskj√∂ld intended to operate. The British would not grant the licence, because of their concern that the resource was being over- worked. They did, however, have a close interest in further researches into whales and whaling. The Swedish and British representatives discussed how this concern could be combined with the Swedes' more general interests in biological, geological and meteorological investigations. A plan emerged for the establishment of a scientific station that would be manned for five years by a team of British and Swedish scientists, funded equally from British and Swedish sources. The Swedish government was supportive of this plan, and promised the required finance. In Britain the government was more reticent, partly because it was pursuing other avenues for the development of whaling research, and also because it was unenthusiastic about funding further Antarctic expeditions. Consequently, much of the British share of the finance for the Anglo‚ÄìSwedish expedition had to be secured from learned societies. Nordenskj√∂ld had achieved some success in obtaining contributions, before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 led to the postponement and eventual cancellation of the project. Many years later, a part-revival of the plan led to the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949‚Äì52. Background: the first Swedish Antarctic expedition The Antarctic, Swedish Antarctic Expedition ship 1901‚Äì03 In 1901 Otto Nordenskj√∂ld, a 31-year-old geologist and university lecturer,, led the first Swedish Antarctic Expedition, one of several ventures heading for the then largely unexplored Antarctic continent at the beginning of the 20th century. Nordenskj√∂ld had previous field experience in Tierra del Fuego, Alaska and Greenland, and had an excellent family pedigree; his uncle, Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld, had won fame for his completion of the first navigation of the Northeast Passage in 1878‚Äì79. The 1901 expedition was funded by private contributions and loans, having failed to secure financial support from the state. In February 1902 Nordenskj√∂ld and a small group of scientists established a base at Snow Hill Island, to the east of Graham Land, while the expedition ship Antarctic carried out survey and other work further north. The following season, when Antarctic returned south to pick up the shore party, she became trapped in the ice and was finally crushed and sunk on 14 February 1903. Her crew escaped to nearby Paulet Island, and the two parts of the expedition each endured a second polar winter in harsh conditions, before both groups were rescued by the Argentine gunboat Uruguay in November 1903. In difficult circumstances the expedition achieved significant scientific results, despite its eclipse in most polar histories by the more glamourised exploits of Scott, Shackleton and others. On his return to Sweden, Nordenskj√∂ld continued with his academic career, being appointed professor of geology at the University of Gothenburg, and carried out field assignments in Finnmark, Spitsbergen and Greenland. Amid these various activities, he was eager to return to the Antarctic, to complete and extend the work of the earlier expedition, and together with Johan Gunnar Andersson, his second-in-command during the 1901 expedition, he sought the means to do so. Negotiations for a whaling licence Map showing the territory claimed by Britain as within the Falkland Island Dependencies (South Georgia is off the map) In April 1911, addressing the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, Nordenskj√∂ld outlined a scheme for a second Antarctic expedition, based on the establishment of a scientific station that would operate over a period of several years. He included in his argument an appeal to nationalism, the desire to restore Sweden to the top ranks of scientific polar exploration. The question of how such a long-term scheme could be financed was a major issue for Nordenskj√∂ld, bearing in mind the funding difficulties that all prospective expeditions faced, and his state of personal indebtedness arising from the financing of the first expedition. The solution, he decided, was to set up a commercial whaling company to operate in the area of the expedition, the profits from which would fund the scientific research. The 1901‚Äì03 expedition had noted the abundance of whales in that area; Carl Anton Larsen, the captain of the Antarctic, had seen the commercial possibilities for whaling there, and had founded an industry which, Nordenskj√∂ld noted in 1914, had developed to the extent that 40 vessels were now employed, producing a yield that over the years had amounted to ¬£2 million. The establishment of a whaling company would not be a straightforward matter. In 1908 the British government had issued Letters Patent claiming sovereignty over this area of the Antarctic, declaring that South Georgia, the South Shetlands and Graham Land were part of the Falkland Island Dependencies (FID). As a result, whaling activities in the area were now subject to British Colonial Office control, through the granting of a licence which, Nordenskj√∂ld was aware, might not easily be obtained. Nevertheless, he and Andersson hoped that with support from leading geographers and polar experts, the difficulty might be overcome. With this in mind they approached Sir John Scott Keltie, secretary of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). Keltie was encouraging; he thought that the proposed scheme for a long-term scientific station was \\"the kind of exploration we now want in the Antarctic\\", and considered it would be not too difficult to get the government's agreement to the granting of a whaling licence. A draft application to the Colonial Office, submitted to the RGS for consideration, made the point that it was as a result of the 1901‚Äì03 Swedish expedition that whaling had become established in the area. The proposed whaling company would not only provide funding to support the scientific station, but would enable the creation of a fund for to support further research, greatly to the benefit of Antarctic whaling. However, when Nordenskj√∂ld and Andersson visited London and met Colonial Office officials, the outcome was disappointing. The government, they were informed, prompted by advice from the Natural History Museum (NHM), was concerned about possible over-fishing and was considering introducing further measures for the protection of whales. In the meantime, no further licences for whaling would be issued. Faced with this setback, Nordenskj√∂ld and Andersson nevertheless felt that if they could convince the NHM of the merits of their plan, they might yet overcome the Colonial Office's objection. They approached Sidney Harmer, the museum's Keeper of Zoology, who after considering their proposal, thought it might provide a practical means for the necessary research into protection of whales: \\"The information that would be gained thereby\\", he wrote in June 1912, \\"is so important that it would probably more than compensate for the number of whales killed\\". Others were less convinced, and when later that year the museum was invited to participate in a government commission to investigate whaling policy, Harmer backtracked. In February 1913 he informed Nordenskj√∂ld and Andersson that he could no longer support their licence application. Revised scheme Louis Palander Thwarted in their desire to base a new Swedish expedition on the revenues from a whaling venture, Nordenskj√∂ld and Andersson devised an alternative strategy: a joint Anglo- Swedish project with shared costs, in which a five-year scientific station manned by British and Swedish scientists would incorporate whaling research into their scientific programme. They established a prestigious committee to deal with the Swedish side of the undertaking, chaired by Louis Palander, the naval officer who had captained the SS Vega on the first successful traverse of the Northeast Passage in 1878‚Äì79. A key member of the committee was the industrialist Axel Lagrelius, who promised to provide half of the Swedish share of the annual costs of the station. Informal talks with government officials indicated that the state would help, if matching contributions were forthcoming from the British. The costs were estimated at ¬£3,000 per year ‚Äì ¬£1500 to be provided from Sweden, ¬£1,500 from Britain. On the British side, although Harmer and Keltie were enthusiastic, the Colonial Office was cool. They had appointed Major Gerald Barrett-Hamilton to conduct a one-man investigation into whaling, and until his report was available, the Colonial Office was unwilling to take further steps. An additional difficulty was the British government policy whereby local projects were required to be locally financed; thus, the projected British annual share of ¬£1,500 would fall on the FID, a sum beyond the means of their small budget. No such problems were encountered on the Swedish side, where the government readily included its share of the costs in the 1914 national budget. Whereas the Swedish government had been influenced by the prestige of such as Palander, and his appeal to \\"bringing new honour to old Sweden\\", in British government circles there was a general weariness with Antarctic expeditions, and no authoritative voice equivalent to Palander's to press the case. In an effort to break the impasse, Nordenskj√∂ld travelled to Britain early in 1914. There, he worked with Harmer to reduce the size of any government contribution, and was able to secure a grant from the NHM of ¬£500 for each of the five projected years of the scientific station. The Royal Society provided a one-off sum of ¬£500. Nordenskj√∂ld hoped that the RGS would match the NHM amount, but in spite of Keltie's advocacy its council would only offer ¬£200 for the first year, and ¬£100 a year thereafter. Meanwhile, Barrett-Hamilton had sent a preliminary report, but died shortly thereafter, leaving his investigation incomplete. While remaining sceptical of the utility of the Swedish plan, the FID then offered a token sum of ¬£100 per year to the venture. Thus, in the spring of 1914, a substantial financial shortfall still existed on the British side. Notwithstanding this, Nordensj√∂ld and Palander made a confident statement of the proposed expedition's aims and objectives, published in the RGS journal in May 1914. Beyond the scientific studies, including the biology of whales, they declared that the expedition would seek to resolve the outstanding question, which Wilhelm Filchner's recently returned German expedition had failed to do, as to whether Antarctica was a single integrated entity, or was divided between separate landmasses on the east and west. On the question of financing, they announced optimistically that \\"the enterprise has met with the heartiest support in England\\", and glossed over the shortfall, stating that \\"to judge from news lately received from the committee, England's [financial] share in the undertaking gives promise of equalling Sweden's\\". A projected start date was given as August 1915. War, delays, abandonment The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 frustrated all these plans. Harmer informed Nordenskj√∂ld that the expedition would have to be postponed; Nordenskj√∂ld hoped a 1915 start was still possible, if the funding shortfall could be overcome. However, Keltie told him that the RGS was suspending its funding, and that making further plans was now pointless. Nordenskj√∂ld would not give up hope, and thought that, if the world situation improved, a 1916 start might be achieved. A notice in the American Wanamaker Diary for 1916 announced the postponement of the departure date until 1916, adding: \\"It is hoped that a further postponement will not be necessary\\". But in October 1917, the NHM withdrew its funding, effectively ending all hope for the expedition. In Sweden, the funding remained in place, and after the war's end in 1918, tentative approaches were made to Britain to see if the idea could be revived. Harmer declared that there was no longer any British interest. In 1919 the Swedish committee dissolved itself, and the funds were distributed to other projects. Aftermath During the 1930s, and again in the 1940s, Andersson raised the possibility of reviving the defunct Anglo-Swedish plans. His suggestion was taken up by the geographer and geologist Hans Ahlmann; there followed proposals for a multi-national scientific expedition involving Norway, Sweden, Britain and perhaps other countries. These discussions led eventually to the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSX) of 1949‚Äì52. This was carried out by a mixed team of Norwegian, British and Swedish scientists, from a base in Queen Maud Land rather than Graham Land, and its researches were confined to glaciology, meteorology and geology. By this time, Nordenskj√∂ld was long since dead. After the First World War he continued his academic career at the University of Gothenburg. He never revisted the Antarctic, although he led expeditions to Peru and southern Chile in 1920-21. He died on 2 June 1928, following a street accident near his home in Gothenburg. In 1919 Andersson returned to China, which he had first visited in 1914. He remained there for many years, devoting himself to archaeological exploration, and discovered the initial evidence that later proved the existence of Peking man. Andersson died in 1960. Keltie retired from the RGS secretaryship in 1915. He was knighted in 1918, and died in 1927. Harmer became director of the Natural History Museum in 1919, serving until his retirement in 1927. He was appointed KBE in 1920, and received many other honours before his death in 1950. The failed Anglo-Swedish Antarctic Expedition was Palander's final involvement in public affairs. He died in 1920.

He was also a leading campaigner and a founding member of the Hulme Asbestos Action Group. He died in 2011 of mesothelioma a type of cancer closely linked to exposure to Asbestos. The legal case against his landlord citing asbestos in his council home leading to his cause of death was one of the first of this type. Early life In his earlier years he attended Lancaster University and was a member of the Gay Liberation Front there, travelling to London for Conferences. In 1978 an article he wrote was published by the Gay Left titled 'Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back', 'Coming Out Six Years On by John Shiers'. On completing his studies at York University he was attracted to the lifestyle of the commercial gay scene at the emerging Manchester Gay Village at Canal Street. In 1978 he lamented on how it changed him, rather than him bringing change in accordance with the ideals he had learned from the Gay Liberation Front. He recalled bouts of depression and how for some time he met his partners through Cottaging, he described his sexual encounters as 'commoditised' and not associated with emotion, he was a member of the organisation 'Friend' at this time . Career In his early work career as a local authority officer he was a strong influence in decentralising council services in Manchester and Rochdale in the 1980s. His career in the early 1990s was with Save The Children where he became a consultant and charity trustee, he was influential in shaping services for children and young people in the North West England region. By the middle of the 1990s he had changed his career to psychosynthesis, to address further bouts of depression, he studied and qualified and went on to build a psychotherapy practice in Didsbury. Campaigns In the late 1970s he had moved to local authority housing in Hulme, owned by Manchester City Council when first arriving in the city. Whilst living in Hulme he discovered he and thousands of his neighbours council properties were riddled with Asbestos. He had been one of the first to speak out about the asbestos in the properties. After his death Manchester Council admitted limited liability, in what was one of the first legal cases of this type. In 1988 he was instrumental in organising a demonstration against Section 28 in Manchester, attended by 25,000 people. In 2011 he was a guest speaker at the Greater Manchester Asbestos Victims Support Group and spoke in the presence of a gathering including Members of parliament Lisa Nandy, Kate Green, Tony Lloyd and Paul Goggins alongside Dr Linda Waldman, co-author of a report on asbestos in social housing at the Action Mesothelioma Day of the need for greater access to information about asbestos in social housing, highlighting risks of no requirement for social housing landlords to inform tenants of the presence of asbestos.

Its representation, in the 1970s and 1980s, of contemporary and mid-century, mostly American and some European original fine prints from major artists was influential on Australian audiences and practitioners, while a selection of the latter's work sympathetic to the gallery ethos was shown alternately and then dominated the program.  Other uses  An unrelated space also called \\"The Photographers' Gallery\\" ran for three years from 1989‚Äì1992 in Brisbane; another, the Photographer's Gallery [sic], was operating in Sydney in the c.1993-2000s at 96 Reserve Road, Artarmon,The Sydney Morning Herald, Friday, 28 July 2000, Page 66; and the 2006 Head-On Portrait Prize Exhibition was held in Balmain, also in Sydney at a short-lived venue called \\"The Photographers Gallery\\".

It was the second gallery devoted to photography to be established in the city after Rennie Ellis' and Robert Ashton's Brummels Gallery, which was started in 1972 less than a kilometre away, and before the Church Street Photography Centre run by Joyce Evans in neighbouring Richmond (1976). = Gallery = Ian Lobb, an Australian born in 1948, who had undertaken workshops with Ansel Adams and Paul Caponigro,Geoff Strong, 'The Melbourne Movement: fashion and faction in the 1970s'. In took over the Gallery in late 1974. Also that year, Lobb was teaching photography at Coburg Technical School with Carol Jerrems, and they met American Bill Heimerman (born 13 January 1950) who was teaching Englsh at the same institution and was renting rooms above the gallery; the two inspired Heimerman's interest in photography. Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975. He and Heimerman became co-directors of the gallery from the beginning of 1976. Beside some government funding and sales, both financially supported their roles through teaching, Heimerman being next employed at Brighton Technical College, where he and other staff members established a photography program, and then at the Council of Adult Education. Critic and photography lecturer Tony Perry noted Heimerman's 'detached, informed view of photography'.Tony Perry, 'Striking quality from 22 top photographers.' In The Age, Friday, 15 June 1979, p.2 Lobb and Heimerman showed some local work, but pursued high profile international, mainly American and some European, photographers for exhibitions.Robert Deane, 'FOREIGN INFLUENCES iN AUSTRALIAN PHOTOGRAPHY 1930-80', A lecture delivered at APSCON, National Gallery of Australia 10 October 2000, Canberra The first exhibition of international photography at the gallery was that of Paul Caponigro in 1975 which sold 22 prints, after which success the gallery was closed for renovations and while Heimerman made a trip to the US to secure more shows. After the refurbishment Melbourne Times critic Wendy Harmer described the space as \\"an oasis of pristine white walls and warm, polished wood.Wendy Harmer, 'Life through the lens.' In The Melbourne Times, 24 February 1982, p.11 = Workshop = As well as exhibitions, and from the outset, workshops were held in the gallery building from which part of the funding for the enterprise was derived. The two floors of the terrace building accommodated a two-person darkroom available for film development and printing, and a demonstration room with 6-8 student capacity. Printing for exhibitions was offered. Technical instruction for beginners and in the Zone System for those more advanced was provided at first by Australian photographer Steven Lojewski in 1976. Evening classes ran for ten weeks. By 1977 Heimerman and Lobb had organised the first workshop to be conducted in Australia by an American photographer, Ralph Gibson, and sponsored another, of 6 days by William Clift in May 1978 (costing participants $200),Gallery brochure, 1978 before Lobb left to pursue his own photography later that year. Jeff Busby, who also exhibited at the gallery, took over later as Heimerman's assistant. Among the more recent workshops was 'How Joshua Greene Saved Marilyn Monroe: Techniques to Rehabilitate Ageing Photographs and the Art of Digital Printing', held on 26 November 2002 by the son of Milton H. Greene who photographed Monroe. In addition to its activities at its own premises was the Gallery's organisation and sponsorship of seminars by international photographers, which began with Ralph Gibson's on 11 August 1977 at Prahran College, then that of Harry Callahan, held on 20 November 1979 at the Prahran Recreational Centre, 147 High Street with also a workshop at the Gallery.  Ethos  By showcasing the silver gelatin 'fine print‚Äô Lobb and Heimerman hoped to improve Australian work by example, as Lobb observed, > \\"From 1975, every second show was an international show [. . .]Tony Perry, > ‚ÄòAustralia: Longing for a photographic identity‚Äô.

In Nevertheless, Jerrems was amongst the first exhibitors at the Gallery, showing there four times before her premature death in 1980. Noted women's activist Beatrice Faust, who reviewed many of the gallery's shows from 1976-88 in The Age newspaper, was supportive in her critiques, and in September 1987 hosted Beatrice Faust Curates: From Boubat to Fereday at the gallery featuring male and female photographers. Certainly women exhibiting were outnumbered by men in a ratio of nearly 10:1 until the 90s, after which they appear on a more equal footing (see below). The Gallery's concentration on American photography in its early years was not in isolation and was prompted as much by interest in international photography amongst Australians as by Heimerman's own contacts in the US, and paralleled international touring exhibitions of Bill Brandt in 1971, and the French Foreign Ministry‚Äôs major exhibition of Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1974. Joyce Evans' Church Street also presented work by American's Minor White, Jerry Uelsmann, Les Krims and others. In mid-1978, the gallery extended a call in the pages of the magazine Light Vision to Australian photographers to submit work for a survey that was to be a traveling exhibition. The final selection, featured in the journal in a double number, 6 and 7, titled 'Special Australian Edition', issued October 1978 with two samples across double-page spreads of each of 21 photographers, many represented and selected by the Photographers Gallery, among them a number who were also 'Correspondents' for Light Vision at the time. Editor Jean-Marc Le Pechoux acknowledged the cooperative nature of the venture in his editorial, and in her introduction Memory Holloway emphasised the breadth of the selection; \\"...a plurality of techniques, ideologies and styles; social documentary; pictorial, surreal landscapes; nudes; portraits; straight photography.\\" Four of the 21 contributors were women, but the exercise marked a shift in the program toward a gender-inclusive representation of Australian photographers of diverse styles and often radical attitudes to picture-making and photographic printing and presentation. Tony Perry, who reviewed shows there 1978-80, was complimentary of contributions by William Heimermann and the 'Photographers Gallery' to Australian Photography in his article 'Australia: looking for a photographic identity', No.25, Vol.5 No.1 as was Peter Turner's interview with Paul Cox in Light Vision.Light Vision No.2, pp 24-29. In 1981, The Age newspaper critic Geoff Strong, in reporting on the imminent closure of Joyce Evans' Church Street gallery, noted that The Photographers' Gallery was also facing tough times during a recession, rising unemployment and a general downturn in the fortunes of art galleries; The status and purpose of the Photographers' Gallery over its long tenure continued to evolve. Critic Beatrice Faust, a supporter of the gallery since its inception, in The Age in January 1990 observed; Nevertheless, the Gallery was to survive for another twenty years. Closure The gallery was closed in 2010 and sold in 2015, and after a period of failing health, Bill Heimerman died on 1 October 2017. Legacy In the 1970s, with the decline of the pictorial magazines and a consequent crisis in photojournalism and documentary photography, a revival of the pre-WW2 interest in photography as a fine art was a world-wide phenomenon, as it was in Australia. In 1972, Beatrice Faust, in reviewing Two Views of Erotica: Henry Talbot/Carol Jerrems at Brummels Gallery in Nation Review urged; The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop, because of its policy of sourcing and promoting established international work of a high standard, was well placed when percipient private collectors were entering the market in fine photographic prints, and major Australian institutions were initiating collections of photography. The inaugural curator of the new photography department Jennie Boddington at the newly (1968) re- housed National Gallery of Victoria; Alison Carroll and Ian North of the Art Gallery of South Australia (which had begun to collect photography as a distinct discipline from the mid-1920's, its building expanded in 1962, refurbished 1979); and David Moore and Wes Stacey at the Australian Centre for Photography (est. 1973); all purchased from the Photographers' Gallery, with special interest in American and European works, along with the National Gallery of Australia, which though not built and opened until 1982, had started a photography collection in 1972. Its director James Mollison turned the sponsorship of the tobacco company Philip Morris International to the acquisition of Australian photography. These sales contributed significantly to the standing and survival of the Gallery, particularly in its early years of the 1970s and 1980s. An archive of The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop is maintained by Heimerman's partner, Barbara Derrick. Exhibitions Other solo or group exhibitions at the Gallery presented photographers Paul Hopper and Ingeborg Tyssen.
