In a 2009 study at the University of Alcal√° in Madrid, Spain, ten sighted subjects were taught basic navigation skills within a few days. The study aimed to analyze various sounds which can be used to echolocate and evaluate which were most effective.

It is situated in of Sherwood Forest approximately south of the town of Mansfield. Portland College has around 270 students aged between 16 and 60. Foundation The college was originally established as institution for the training for men who had been disabled through war injuries and for miners injured or made ill through working in that industry.The History of Portland College Portland College. Retrieved 23 January 2017. The college was founded in 1949. The college's early development owed much to the energy, enthusiasm and vision of Winifred, Duchess of Portland. The Duchess had been inspired to act after regular visits to Harlow Wood Hospital near Mansfield in the 1940s. She shared a vision along with Doctor Alan Malkin an orthopaedic surgeon, to provide provision for the hope of retraining and re-employment of the patients after they had recovered and left the hospital. In 1947 the Duke of Portland had transferred of his land in Sherwood Forest to the Duchess's Charity through a deed of gift and a further had been purchased for the sighting of the new college. Along with these moves a Workers Contributory Fund had been established which encouraged local Nottinghamshire employees to contribute one penny a week towards the ¬£100,000 estimated to open the college. By 1948 some 17,000 workers had agreed to take part in the scheme and by 1949 a total of 20,000 workers were in the scheme. The Foundation stone was laid by the then Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen on 29 June 1949. By the end of the year ¬£90,000 () had been raised. Building Begins The Architect of Portland College was Thomas Nelson Cartwright of Evans, Cartwright and Woollatt. The buildings were designed with the needs of disabled people in mind. There were no stairs in the student areas, all doors were made wide enough for wheelchairs, and bathrooms and bedrooms were fitted with aids and adaptations. By early 1950 two accommodation blocks, a dining hall, workshops and the boiler house had been completed. Staff for the college had been recruited and in June 1950 the college opened its doors to its first students. On 24 July 1950 Her Majesty The Queen officially opened Portland College. Initial years: 1950 to 1969 The College was able to offer four courses to it initial intake of 18 students. These were gardening, bench carpentry, boot and shoe repair and surgical boot making, and clerical and commercial. These students included ex- miners and ex-servicemen and there disabilities ranged from quiescent tuberculosis and poliomyelitis to limb amputees. Despite their widely varying backgrounds, these students thrived in spite of being away from home in an environment that was conducive to discussion, debate and friendship helping each other with their problems and frustrations associated with all their disabilities. Throughout the 1950s the college went from strength to strength. In 1953 the Administration Block was opened. It had a close working relationship with the National Coal Board with efforts particular aimed at the mining communities. The college also became a vital link for disabled and handicapped school leavers supplying further education and the college commitments were extended to provide this along with vocational training. 1961 saw the first female students enrolled at the college. At this time new courses were introduced and these included shorthand and typing followed by course in electronic wiring and assembly, and industrial electronics. The college along with the Ministry of Labour developed a pilot sheltered employment project. Workshops on site produced and marketed its own line of gift local cut oak products with the theme of Sherwood Forest and local legendary hero Robin Hood. 1970 to 1989 The 1970s saw the college having to cope with the climate of high unemployment, high inflation and political turmoil. The rising inflation meant rising running costs, which in turn affected the funding from local education authorities. Further consequences were that ever urgent fundraising became more difficult. Nevertheless Portland College continued its improvements to its curriculum. An appeal to raise ¬£80,000 to improve and extend the college's residential provisions and the education and vocation wings was successful. In 1975 the college introduced Literacy courses. A new concept in the teaching of Literacy was pioneered at the college by Don Price MBE, who was the Assistant Director of the college. Don and his wife Jeune invented the Portland Blend System in 1977. This teaching system was fundamental to great achievements by students at Portland and around the world. As a tried and proven improvement to the teaching of Literacy, this system attracted wide attention from the academic community and the system was marketed under the name 'Phonic Blend Systems Limited', with the college retaining a financial interest through an agreement on royalties. The later part of the seventies and early eighties saw the rapid increases in modern technology. The college soon saw the potential as training aids the newly installed computers and micro-writers in classrooms. By 1983 Portland saw a significant milestone when the 5,000th student passed through the college. In 1988 the college opened its Vocational Training Department's Technical Centre which provided students with courses in computing. 1990 to 1999 The new decade marked Portland's 40th anniversary and to celebrate this achievement Her Majesty The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the college in June 1990. the royal party spent the day at the college, presenting awards at the prize giving and Her Majesty also laid the foundation stone for a new residential unit which would eventually be called the 'laurels'. The Laurels was completed in 1992 which added new High-care accommodation for 60 residential learning skills students. The early years of the 1990s also saw a shift in the college's Vocational Department to competence based training with the National Vocation Qualifications, replacing the traditional examinations. In 1993 funds were raised to build Rowan Place independence units. The college's dining rooms were also upgraded and extended. In the College's Golden Jubilee Year a state of the arts hydrotherapy pool and fitness centre was added to Portland's excellent campus facilities. The 1990s also saw an increase in the numbers of students from around 200 at the beginning of the decade rising to 280 at any one time in 1999. By the new millennium over 8,000 students had now passed through Portland College. 2000 to the present In the new millennium Portland faced new challenges with massive changes taking place in the education, care and inspection directives. In the Learning and skills Department, Essential Skills Programmes were enhanced with student placed into the programmes according to their individual needs and aspirations. The Employment Department saw the emphasise shift towards Information Technology-based training which it embraced. The college won a prestige's award for 'Best Local Academy for the year of 2000 in UK, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. For its work in its Cisco Academy. With this the college was accredited to become a regional Academy and has continued to offer excellent training opportunities for the students of Portland. The Karten Trust provide funds for the college's CTEC centre and this has been instrumental in giving students skills in Web Page Design and to create a Computer Aided Design program with student being able to access software and producing live work for both internal and external customers. The department has a record for securing employments for graduates of the College. In 2003 the college became Microsoft Office Specialist Authorised Testing Centre and with the Microsoft Academy giving students the opportunities for qualifications in the full range of Microsoft Programmes. After over half a century of steady growth, the number of students at Portland has stabilised in recent years to a level of between 250 and 300 students. With around 30 of these being day students from the surrounding area. The employment students attend the course on a steady roll‚Äìon-roll off basis rather than an academic year.  Information and Communication Technology learning centre 200px In 1997 the college Principal Mike Syms put together the concept of an Information and Communication Technology learning centre. By July 2006 the college had reached its fund raising target of ¬£3.2 million and a further ¬£370,000 for equipment and technology. In May 2004 the official ground breaking ceremony took place performed by HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Just as his mother, the Queen, had laid the foundation stone for the college in 1949, Prince Edward carried out the unveiling of the foundation stone for the new centre almost 60 years later. The buildings Architects were Patel Taylor of London. The main construction contract was given to a local company Clegg Construction of Lace Market in Nottingham. Work commenced in May 2005 and the finished building was handed over in June 2006. The new building has ten teaching spaces. These teaching spaces include the IT Essentials Suite, Computer Aided Design Suite, CISCO and Microsoft Academies, Job Club and Transition Suite, Skills for Life/Learning Resource Suite, Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) Suite, Learning and Skills Information Learning Technology Suite and a Research and Development Centre. There are also various meeting rooms and a new main reception. The new centre is furnished with equipment and furniture. There are specially designed desk with integrally fitted computers and interactive whiteboards and ceiling mounted projectors in some of the rooms. All the workstations have chairs.

Biography Pagno di Lapo was born at Fiesole, near Florence. In 1426-28 Pagno di Lapo was working as a stone-cutter in the joint shop of Donatello and Michelozzo in Pisa, during the production of the Coscia and Brancacci tombs. In 1428 he collaborated with two obscure stone-cutters on the decorative elements of the baptismal font in the Duomo of Siena, and as a garzone in Donatello's shop in connection with the resumed work on the pulpit for Prato, 1434. In Florence he was occupied between 1448 and 1451 with decorative carving executed concurrently for the Basilica of San Lorenzo and Palazzo Medici (both projects under Michelozzo again).First noted by Isabelle Hyman, \\"Notes and Speculations on S. Lorenzo, Palazzo Medici, and an Urban Project by Brunelleschi\\", The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 34.2 (May 1975:98-120) and summarized in her Fifteenth Century Florentine Studies: The Palazzo Medici and a Ledger for the Church of San Lorenzo (New York and London) 1977. Documents show that he was working on chapels for the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna between 1451 and about 1469, never designated there as a scultore but as a stone-cutter or marble- worker. Nevertheless, he is credited with designing Palazzo Isolani on Piazza Santo Stefano, which was built between 1451-55. Basing their attributions on Giorgio Vasari, a significant number of Early Renaissance sculptures have been associated with Pagno's name since the late nineteenth century, most notably the Madonna and Child at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.H. W. Janson, \\"Two Problems in Florentine Renaissance Sculpture: part I. Pagno di Lapo\\", The Art Bulletin 4.4 (December 1942:326-334) pp 326- Modern scholars, however, assign to Michelozzo other sculptures Vasari assigns to Pagno di Lapo in the same passage, which Vasari had claimed for Michelozzo in the first edition of his Lives, and more recent documentation reassigns to Pagno di Lupo a less exalted role as a sculptor of decorative stonework. When Piero de' Medici planned to commission a marble tabernacle in the Gothic Chiesa della Santissima Annunziata, the church of the Servi di Maria, Florence, he consulted Michelozzo, who seems to have provided the design, but left the execution of its architectural enframement to Pagno di Lapo, whose inscription runs round the inside of the architrave. Vasari, in noticing the inscription in time for his revision of Le Vite, revised his attribution of other sculptures at the Santissima Annunziata, attributing to Pagno metalwork that documents actually show to have been supplied by Maso di Bartolomeo,Hyman 1975. Maso was another of the craftsmen consistently at work in Michelozzo's projects. doubtless under Michelozzo's supervision; Vasari added to his attributions the Madonna and Child relief illustrated above, which was already in the Opera del Duomo. On this slender basis early twentieth-century scholars erected an increased oeuvre for Pagno di Lapo, until in 1942 H.W. Jansen related the relief to a group of reliefs of the Madonna and Child, recognized as by the youthful Agostino di Duccio, under the influence of Luca della Robbia. The sole surviving identifiable work by Pagno di Lapo is the inscribed tabernacle frame, which Jansen found \\"shows him to have been a skillful carver of ornament, but the plastic d√©cor of the structure contains so little of true sculpture that it yields small evidence of his artistic ability.\\"Jansen 1942:329. Jansen considered the possibility that the altar table from the tabernacle, now in the Museo Bardini, Florence, was also Pagno's.

Based on a story by Clifford Grey, with a screenplay by Sidney Gilliat, the film is a tale about a European express train to Rome carrying a variety of characters, including thieves, adulterers, blackmail victims, and an American film star. The film won the American National Board of Review award for Best Foreign Film. Rome Express was remade as Sleeping Car to Trieste (1948). It was shot at the Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush. The film's sets were designed by the art director Andrew Mazzei, with the costume design by Gordon Conway. Plot The film is centred almost entirely on the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits train the Rome Express, travelling between Paris and Rome. Just as the train is departing from a station in Paris, Zurta and his colleague Tony just manage to board the train. They have found out that someone they want to see is on board. Another passenger, McBain, a wealthy businessman travelling with his brow-beaten secretary/valet, Mills, learns that a painting by Van Dyck, which he had previously tried to buy and which had later been stolen, has not been recovered and says he would do anything to obtain it. Also on the train are an adulterous couple, an annoyingly sociable Englishman, a French police inspector, and an American film star who is tiring of her fame, accompanied by her manager/publicist. It transpires that the stolen painting is in the possession of a man, Poole, who conspicuously keeps his briefcase close to him at all times. When he agrees to join a poker game, he finds that one of the other players is Zurta, and Poole's reaction shows that they know each other. Poole is disconcerted and carelessly sets down his briefcase, which is later innocently taken by Mills, who has a similar briefcase. After the game ends, Zurta follows Poole to his compartment, forces his way in and confronts Poole, who offers to hand over the painting but finds he has the wrong briefcase. After Zurta threatens to throw him from the train, they struggle and Poole is killed. Meanwhile, McBain discovers in Mills' briefcase the stolen Van Dyck he had wanted to buy. When Poole's body is discovered by an attendant, the police inspector begins an investigation and interviews all those who have been in contact with Poole. Zurta learns that the briefcases have been switched and tries to recover it from McBain's compartment, but is apprehended by McBain and Mills until the inspector arrives. Then Mills discovers the stolen painting hidden in McBain's compartment and realizes that McBain found it. He tries to use it to blackmail McBain, but McBain outwits him and takes it to the police. As the police inspector begins to suspect him, Zurta leaps from the train in an attempt to escape, but is killed.

It was the last unit of its kind to be founded by the Allied armies. Among the campaigns which it recorded were the invasion of Sicily, the D-Day Landings, the liberation of Paris and the Elbe River link-up of the Allied armies, known as 'Elbe Day'. History Sergeant George A. Game of the Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit operating his camera near San Leonardo di Ortona, Italy, December 10, 1943 The first official Canadian army photographer was Lieutenant Laurie Audrain of Winnipeg; he was appointed on June 25, 1940. However, it was soon recognized that a dedicated photographic unit was necessary. The CFPU was formed on June 19, 1941 under the command of Captain William Abell of Winnipeg. By the end of World War II, fifty nine Canadian photographers and cameramen had been involved in combat operations in Europe. Of these, six were killed and eighteen were wounded.O'Regan p. 1. The CFPU was staffed by enlisted men and women. Its objectives were to film Canadian troops in action and supply the Department of National Defence, and also media outlets, with theatrical newsreels and still photographs. It was the first Allied unit to provide film of the assault waves landing in Sicily and Normandy, the first to get still pictures from Normandy onto the front pages of the world press, and the only one to produce colour pictures of Operation Overlord.O'Regan Among its members were: * Charles Roos, who was the first Allied cameraman ashore on D-Day. Roos' film of Canadian soldiers disembarking under fire on Juno Beach is among the most iconic footage of the D-Day Landings.O'Regan 2005 * Al Calder, who parachuted over the Rhine during Operation Market Garden, (General Montgomery's bold but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to bring the war to an end by Christmas 1944). * Lieutenant Ken Bell, who landed on Juno Beach on D-Day with The Highland Light Infantry of Canada, and shot the only surviving colour footage of D-Day. * Llewellyn Weekes, who shot the liberation of Paris. * Sergeant D.W.

G. (1990). Invertebrate Relationships : Patterns in Animal Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.). Pole cells are the cells that form at the polar ends of the Drosophila egg, which begin the adult germ cells. Pole plasm functions to bud the development of polar cells, as well as restore fertilization, even when the cell was previously sterile.  Formation  During early development of the Drosophila development, pole plasm assembles at the posterior pole of the Drosophila embryo, allowing determination of the abdominal patterning. Late in oogenesis, polar organelles, which are electro-negative granules, are in the pole plasm. When the pole plasm further matures, it continues to consist of polar granules into the development of germ cells, which develop into adult germ cells. Serine protease activity occurs less than 2 hours after the budding of the pole cells from the pole plasm, and ending just prior to the movement of the pole cells via gastrulation. The patterning of the pole cells are determined by the activation of Oskar, which acts in the determination of body patterning segments. Pole cells begin their migration in a cluster in the midgut primordium. To reach their final destination, pole cells must migrate through the epithelial wall. It is known that the cells migrate through the epithelial wall, but little is known about the mechanisms used to do so.

With foundry headquarters in Dortmund, Germany, induction heating headquarters in Brookfield, WI United States, and operations in China, Sweden, Thailand, Russia, Mexico, India, Japan and Brazil, ABP operates worldwide.  History  In 1903, the predecessor of ABP, ASEA (Allmanna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget) in Sweden built the first induction channel furnace for foundry operations. Basing on the principle that the energy required for the melting process is induced directly into the charge by electromagnetic coils, ASEA managed to create a new technology that is fundamentally more efficient and precise. In order to expend the know-how of the company and to consolidate its market position, ASEA decided to merge in 1988 with Brown Boveri from Switzerland and to form ABB (Asea Brown Boveri). The new firm added sophisticated control, automation and information technology to the products, and supplemented them with consulting, planning, start-up and training services. Today their components and systems are used in nearly every foundry throughout the world. In 2005, with the backing of a group of experienced foundry industry investors, the Foundry Systems group was acquired from ABB and ABP Induction, LLC was born. In 2008 ABP Induction and the Pillar Induction Company combined their operations into ABP Induction. In January 2011, Ajax Tocco Magnethermic acquired the assets and intellectual property formerly known as Pillar from ABP Induction. The sale included the Brookfield, Wisconsin and Sterling Heights, Michigan operations.

She began gymnastics at the age of four and went on to become the Ukrainian National Champion in 1996.GymBox Bio Competitive history Karpenko made her world debut at the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, Japan with strong performances; however, she was overshadowed by veteran gymnasts and did not medal. Shortly after, she injured her hamstring and was unable to compete in the 1996 Olympic Games. The following year, she broke a finger during training and was forced to watch the 1997 World Championships from the stands. In March 1998 she surprised coaches by winning the American Cup against U.S. hopefuls Vanessa Atler and Kristen Maloney. In April she placed second in the uneven bars final behind five-time world uneven bars champion Svetlana Khorkina at the European Championships. At the 1999 World Championships, Karpenko performed with ease and placed second in the all-around competition.IG Interview Things were looking great for Karpenko in early 2000, as she won preliminaries at the European Championships in Paris. Ending up third in the all-around, she also grabbed a silver on the uneven bars, and tied for another second-place finish on floor exercise in event finals. Despite these accomplishments, Karpenko is known for her performance at the 2000 Olympic Games, where she did not earn a medal. A favorite for the all-around title, Karpenko was in first place going into the final rotation. As she finished her first pass on floor, she stubbed her toe, tripped, and fell out of bounds. She subsequently received a score of 8.725 and dropped to 12th place.2000 Olympic All Around Results Karpenko moved to Bulgaria in June 2002, and had two short-lived comebacks in both 2003 and 2006, competing for Bulgaria. Marred by injury, she never retained her form or individual results. In March 2012, China forfeited the 1999 World Championship team bronze medals to Ukraine, who placed fourth. It was discovered in 2008 that China falsified the age of team member Dong Fangxiao, therefore nullifying her results from this competition as well as the 2000 Olympics.

After independence, in pursuance of the government's policy to discourage distinctions between communities based on race, the 1951 Census of India did away with racial classifications. Today, the national Census of independent India does not recognize any racial groups in India.Kumar, Jayant. Indian Census 2001. September 4, 2006. Some scholars of the colonial epoch attempted to find a method to classify the various groups of India according to the predominant racial theories popular at that time in Europe. This scheme of racial classification was used by the British census of India, which was often integrated with caste system considerations. Great races Scientific racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries divided humans into four races: Caucasoid (white), Mongoloid (yellow), Negroid (black) and Australoid. The indigenous population of India was assumed to be intermediate between Caucasoid and Australoid. Edgar Thurston named this type Homo Dravida and described it close to Australoids, with Caucasoid (Indo-Aryan) admixture. As evidence, he adduced the use of the boomerang by Kallar and Maravar warriors and the proficiency at tree-climbing among both the Kadirs of the Anamalai hills and the Dayaks of Borneo.C. Bates, 'Race, Caste and Tribes in Central India' in: The Concept of Race, ed. Robb, OUP (1995), p. 245, cited after Ajay Skaria, Shades of Wildness Tribe, Caste, and Gender in Western India, The Journal of Asian Studies (1997), p. 730. Although anthropologists classify Dravidians as Caucasoid with the \\"Mediterranean-Caucasoid\\" type being the most predominant, the racial status of the Dravidians was initially disputed. In 1898, ethnographer Friedrich Ratzel remarked about the \\"Mongolian features\\" of Dravidians, resulting in what he described as his \\"hypothesis of their [Dravidians] close connection with the population of Tibet\\", whom he adds \\"Tibetans may be decidedly reckoned in the Mongol race\\".Ratzel, Freidrich. The History of Mankind. Macmillan and Co.:New York, 1898. p.358 In 1899, Science summarized Ratzel's findings over India with, In 1900, anthropologist Joseph Deniker said, Deniker grouped Dravidians as a \\"subrace\\" under \\"Curly or Wavy Hair Dark Skin\\" in which he also includes the Ethiopian and Australian. Also, Deniker mentions that the \\"Indian race has its typical representatives among the Afghans, the Rajputs, the Brahmins and most of North India but it has undergone numerous alterations as a consequence with crosses with Assyriod, Dravidian, Mongol, Turkish, Arab and other elements.\\" In 1915, Arnold Wright said, Wright also mentions that Richard Lydekker and Flowers classified Dravidians as Caucasian. Later, Carleton S. Coon, in his book The Races of Europe (1939), reaffirmed this assessment and classified the Dravidians as Caucasoid due to their \\"Caucasoid skull structure\\" and other physical traits such as noses, eyes and hair, and 20th century anthropologists classified Dravidians as Caucasoid with the \\"Mediterranean-Caucasoid\\" type being the most predominant. Martial races theory The martial races theory was a British ideology based on the assumption that certain people were more martially inclined as opposed to the general populace or other peoples.Heather Streets. Martial Races: The military, race and masculinity in British Imperial Culture, 1857-1914 The British divided the entire spectrum of Indian ethnic groups into two categories: a \\"martial race\\" and a \\"non-martial race\\". The martial race was thought of as typically brave and well built for fighting for e.g.Rajput, Nair's, Reddy's etc.Rand, Gavin. Martial Races and Imperial Subjects: Violence and Governance in Colonial India 1857‚Äì1914. European Review of History. The non-martial races were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their sedentary lifestyle. The Indian rebellion of 1857 may have played a role in British reinforcement of the martial races theory. During this rebellion, some Indian troops, particularly in Bengal, mutinied, but the Dogras, Gurkhas, Garhwalis, Sikhs, Rajputs, Jats, Kumaonis and Pakhtuns (Pathans) did not join the mutiny and fought on the side of the British Army. Modern scholars have suggested that this theory was propagated to accelerate recruitment from among these races, while discouraging enlistment of \\"disloyal\\" Indians who had sided with the rebel army during the war. This may have been because these rebellious forces were the ones that helped the British in the annexation of Punjab in the past.Country Studies: Pakistan - Library of Congress  Brahmans  Brahmans were describe as ' the oldest of the martial classes'.Brahmans were recruited by Indian Army in a different guise long before their sudden rediscovery by Claude Auchinleck as 'the oldest of the martial classes'. In the past having two of the oldest regiments, the 1st Brahmans and 3rd Brahmans. Brahmins have highest percentage of this R1a1 haplogroup.

He is a professor of French literature at McGill University, Montreal, and holder of the James McGill Chair of Social Discourse Theory there. He is a leading exponent of the sociocritical approach to literature. Education He studied at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) from 1959 to 1967. His dissertation on the rhetoric of surrealism placed him in the line of Cha√Øm Perelman, and the Groupe Mu of the University of Li√®ge.  Social discourse and sociocritique  Along with Claude Duchet, Pierre V. Zima, Jacques Leenhardt, Andr√© Belleau, Jacques Dubois and R√©gine Robin, Angenot made use of the sociological approach to texts. His influences were Pierre Bourdieu, the Frankfurt School, and Mikhail Bakhtin. He favoured the discourse concept over the structuralist position on \\"text\\", of G√©rard Genette and Tzvetan Todorov. His proposal to study the whole array of \\"social discourse\\" in a given state of society (1889: Un √©tat du discours social, 1989) was a vast interdisciplinary project concerning the interdiscursive construction of society. Discursive history In parallel, Angenot developed \\"discursive history\\". Here he examined the grand narratives, but as a modernist, rather than postmodernist. He has been concerned with the nineteenth century, and representative thinkers around revolution and social struggles: Auguste Comte, Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, √âtienne Cabet, Pierre Leroux, Proudhon, the Belgian Hippolyte Colins, Jules Guesde, Georges Sorel, and others. His conclusions are on the complexities and breaks within this tradition of discourse. Rhetoric Angenot also published a number of books in rhetoric and argumentation, among which La Parole pamphl√©taire in 1982, Rh√©torique de l'anti-socialisme in 2004, and a treatise of \\"antilogical\\" rhetoric, Dialogues de sourds: Trait√© de rh√©torique antilogique in 2008.

Many ethnic Estonians considered the Bronze Soldier in the city centre a symbol of Soviet occupation and repression. At the same time, the monument has significant symbolic value to Estonia's large ethnic Russian community, symbolising not only Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, but also their claim to equal rights in Estonia.Russian Historian: The problem is how to live together if the two peoples have such a different memory, Alexander Daniel, REGNUM News Agency May 4, 2007 Amid political controversy, in April 2007 the Government of Estonia started final preparations for the relocation of the statue and reburial of the associated remains, according to the political mandate received from the previous elections (held in March 2007). Disagreement over the appropriateness of the action led to mass protests and riots (accompanied by looting), lasting for two nights, the worst in Estonia since the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. During the riots, one Russian rioter was killed. In the early morning hours of April 27, 2007, after the first night's rioting, the Government of Estonia decided, at an emergency meeting, to relocate the monument immediately, referring to security concerns. By the following afternoon, the stone structure had been dismantled as well. As of the afternoon of April 30, the statue without the stone structure had been placed at the Defence Forces Cemetery of Tallinn.Picture of statue in new place An opening ceremony for the relocated statue was held on May 8, VE Day. (Soviet Army veterans celebrate Victory Day a day later, on May 9.) During June 2007, the stone structure was rebuilt. Relatives have made claims to bodies of four of the war dead. Unclaimed remains were reburied at the military cemetery, next to the relocated monument, on July 3, 2007.  Background  = Historical background = On July 3, 1933, aggression was defined in a binding treaty signed at the Soviet Embassy in London by the USSR and The Republic of Estonia. Forms of aggression were defined: \\"A naval blockade of coasts or ports of another State; Invasion by armed forces of the territory of another State even without a declaration of war.\\"Aggression Defined at Time MagazineLeague of Nations Treaty Series, 1934, No. 3391. On September 24, 1939, warships of the Red Navy appeared off Estonian ports and Soviet bombers began to patrol over Tallinn and the nearby countryside. Moscow's Week at Time Magazine on Monday, October 9, 1939 On June 12, 1940, the order for a total military blockade on Estonia was given to the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Pavel Petrov at Finnish Defence Forces home page documents published from the State Archive of the Russian Navy On June 16, 1940, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia.Five Years of Dates at Time magazine on Monday, Jun. 24, 1940 The Soviet Union occupied and subsequently annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as Soviet republics in 1940. After the German occupation of 1941‚Äì1944, Soviet forces reconquered Estonia in the autumn of 1944 and Estonia remained a part of the USSR until 1991. During this era, Soviet authorities removed and obliterated numerous historical Estonian monuments. Cemeteries that were destroyed by the authorities during the Soviet era in Estonia include Baltic German cemeteries established in 1774 Kopli cemetery, M√µigu cemetery and the oldest cemetery in Tallinn, from 16th century, Kalamaja cemetery.The destruction of cemeteries by Robert Nerman At the Tallinn Military Cemetery (where the Bronze Soldier was relocated in 2007) the graves of 240 Estonian soldiers from the Estonian War of Independence were reused by the Red Army. The monument for Estonia's independence was destroyed by the Soviet authorities. Only the graves of two Estonian generalsthe destruction of Tallinn Military Cemetery by Pekka Erelt and 15 British servicemen from the era were saved by making the ground a maintenance area. = Interpretation of history = In 1989, during perestroika, the era of reassessment of Soviet history in the USSR, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Nazi Germany and itself that had led to the invasion and occupation of the three Baltic countries.The Forty-Third Session of the UN Sub-Commission at Google Scholar The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the restoration of the Republic of Estonia's sovereignty (See History of Estonia: Regaining independence.) The mass deportations of ethnic Estonians during the Soviet era together with migration into Estonia from other parts of the Soviet Union had resulted in the share of ethnic Estonians in the country decreasing from 88% in 1934 to 62% in 1989.

According to the European Court of Human Rights, the lawful government of Estonia in 1940 was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. The government of the Soviet Union conducted large-scale and systematic actions against the Estonian population.

World War II Red Army veterans and representatives of the Russian-speaking population in Estonia have continued to gather at the monument on certain dates, celebrating May 9 (Victory Day) and September 22 (\\"Liberation of Tallinn\\" in 1944). The display of Soviet flags and other Soviet symbols at these gatherings had offended many Estonians. A non-violent confrontation at the monument site took place on May 9, 2006, when a group of Estonians approached the celebrating Red Army veterans. To preserve public order and out of security concerns, the police helped the group to leave the area, along with their Estonian flag, and let the veterans' meeting with the Soviet symbols continue. On the next day, Estonian nationalist J√ºri Liim said he would blow up the monument unless the authorities removed it promptly. In the same month, the tensions rose again and the police kept a 24-hour patrol in place, cordoning off the area until early September 2006. Estonian journalist Paavo Kangur in an opinion piece suggested that the confrontations were intentionally provoked to increase the support of Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica and \\"Estonian Nazi sympathizers\\" having been manipulated by Russian FSB service. Russian translation , . A small group of Estonian Russophones set up an organization in mid-2006 called Nochnoy Dozor (Night Watch), calling for nightly vigils to guard the monument from possible removal attempts. On April 24, 2007, in explaining the necessity for thorough investigation of the burials, Estonian PM Andrus Ansip related a number of urban legends (grave holds remains of executed looters or drunk Red Army soldiers run over by Red Army tank). The Russian press sensationalized Ansip's comments in their headlines, presenting Ansip as disparaging Red Army veterans.  Legislative preparations  = War Graves Protection Act = On January 10, 2007, the Riigikogu (the Estonian parliament) passed the War Graves Protection Act, with 66 votes in favour and 6 against, initiated by the Estonian Reform Party, Social Democratic Party, Res Publica Party and Isamaaliit Party. The preamble of the Act states: : In observance and acknowledgement of the obligation of the Republic of Estonia to guarantee the protection, respect and dignified treatment of the remains of persons who have died in acts of war conducted on the territory of Estonia; finding that the burying of persons who have died in acts of war to unsuitable places is in discord with European culture and the tradition of honouring the memory and remains of the deceased; on the basis of Article 34 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1) adopted on June 8, 1977, according to which the Estonian state is obliged to guarantee the respect of the remains and gravesites of persons who have died due to acts of war in the territory of Estonia, and the marking thereof, and in pursuance of which the Estonian state is entitled to rebury the remains on the basis of the public interest, the Riigikogu passes this Act. (Official translation of the legal text) The Act came into force on January 20, 2007. Estonia has mutual war grave protection treaties with Finland and Germany but not with Russia, giving special status to many war graves in Estonia but not the one on T√µnism√§gi. The War Graves Protection Act's major result was to codify the international customs and practices regarding the handling of war graves (see above) into country-unspecific terms, and to extend unilateral protection to war graves not covered by mutual international protection treaties. Most 20th- century battles on Estonian soil having been fought by Soviet (largely ethnically-Russian), German, Estonian armies and a formation of the Finnish volunteers under Estonian command, almost all war graves in Estonia not covered by mutual treaties or earlier domestic laws are those of the Red Army. Another effect of the law was that it placed all war graves under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Ministry of Defence. T√µnism√§gi being city land, municipal cooperation would have been necessary for exhumation and/or monument removal without such legislation.Kommersant: Estonia Govt Fighting Bronze Soldier Postimees: Ansip ei v√§lista pronkss√µduri saatuse otsustamist riigikogus As non-citizen residents can vote in Estonian municipal elections and were largely in support of retaining the statue, the City Council of Tallinn has a large Russian representation and any approval was unlikely in the foreseeable future. The law eliminated the need to negotiate with the municipal government for war grave related business‚Äîspecifically, exhumation of the buried bodies and, if the corpses would be found, relocation of the monument which would then be considered a grave marker. = Proposed Law on Forbidden Structures = On February 15, 2007, Riigikogu approved the Law on Forbidden Structures by 46 votes to 44. This would have banned the public display of monuments that glorify the Soviet Union or Estonia's fifty years of Bolshevism. The monument itself was specifically mentioned, to be relocated within 30 days of the President signing this into law. However, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves vetoed the law, arguing that it did not comply with the constitution of Estonia (the only legal basis for a presidential veto under Estonian constitution). A veto override was never attempted and this bill did not become law.  Public perception  The idea of relocation was opposed by a plurality among inhabitants of Estonia. According to an opinion poll ordered by Eesti P√§evaleht and performed by Turu-uuringute AS from April 5 through April 22, 2007, 37% of respondents supported relocation of the monument, while 49% were against relocation and 14% had not formed any opinion on the subject. Relocation of the monument had slightly stronger support from native Estonian speakers‚Äî49% in favour of relocation‚Äîwhile only 9% of native Russian speakers supported relocation. According to a non-scientific poll by the daily newspaper Postimees on April 25, when preparations for relocation had already begun, 85.12% of online readers taking part in the poll voiced their support for the relocation, 12.98% opposed it and the remaining were uncertain.Link to daily polls by Postimees ; the specific poll in question (\\"Kas pronkss√µdur tuleks T√µnism√§elt √§ra viia?\\") can be found by browsing to 25.04.2007 According to the article in Eesti P√§evaleht, in Russia special services encouraged media to discuss the Bronze Soldier often and in a particularly emotional way, as a way of influencing political opinion.Eesti P√§evaleht June 20, 2008: Kaitsepolitsei aastaraamat: Vene luure tegi mullu Eestis usinalt t√∂√∂d by K√§rt Anvelt Among other activities, this translated into opposing and denouncing of high-level Russian politicians who supported civilised relocation of the Bronze Soldier.

Human rights issues concerning arrests and use of force by the police In November 2007, the UN Committee Against Torture has considered Estonia's report and expressed concern over \\"allegations of brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel, especially with regard to the disturbances that occurred in Tallinn in April 2007, well documented by a detailed compilation of complaints\\". In 2013, the same committee noted that it was \\"concerned at information that no prosecutions resulted from official applications to the Chancellor of Justice or the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office in relation to allegations of brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel during the events which took place in Tallinn in April 2007\\" (Para. 11). In March 2013, the European Court of Human Rights decided that Estonian authorities had violated Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment) in respect of four people detained during the events. In 2011, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (Council of Europe) has published its report on its 2007 visit to Estonia, stating that many of the persons detained by the police in connection with the April 2007 events in Tallinn were not granted all the fundamental safeguards (the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or another third party of their choice of their situation, the right of access to a lawyer, and the right of access to a doctor) from the outset of their detention: while many of the persons concerned were allowed to contact someone and to be assisted by a lawyer only when brought before a judge, a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to see a doctor whilst in police custody had been denied, even when they displayed visible injuries.

Unlike most benzodiazepines, tifluadom has no activity at the GABAA receptor, but instead is a selective agonist for the Œ∫-opioid receptor. In accordance, it has potent analgesic and diuretic effects in animals, and also has sedative effects and stimulates appetite. While tifluadom has several effects which might have potential uses in medicine such as analgesia and appetite stimulation, Œ∫-opioid agonists tend to produce undesirable effects in humans such as dysphoria and hallucinations, and so these drugs tend to only be used in scientific research. Dysphoric effects are similar to those seen when using other Œ∫-opioid receptor agonists like pentazocine and salvinorin A, and can be considered the opposite of morphine-induced euphoria. As such, kappa agonists are believed to have very limited abuse potential.

Drawbars are in common use with rail transport, road trailers, both large and small, industrial and recreational, and with agricultural equipment. Agriculture Agricultural equipment is hauled by a tractor mounted drawbar. Specialist agricultural tools such as ploughs are attached to specialist drawbars which have functions in addition to transmitting tractive force. This was partly made redundant with Ferguson‚Äôs development of the 3 point linkage in his famous TE20. Road A drawbar is mounted or located on the tractive vehicle and is used to accept the coupling of the load. The direction of haulage may be push or pull, though pushing tends to be for a pair of ballast tractors working one pulling and the other pushing an exceptional load on a specialist trailer. The drawbar should not be confused with the fifth wheel coupling. The drawbar requires a trailer which either loads the drawbar lightly (for example a small boat trailer, or caravan, where a load of up to ~ is part of correct trailer loading practice), or the load is the weight of the coupling components only (larger trailers, usually but not always with a steerable hauled axle, front or rear). By contrast, the fifth wheel is designed to transmit a major proportion of the load's weight to the hauling vehicle. Rail Two or more passenger cars or freight cars may be attached by means of a drawbar.

On 10 July 1627 Charles I appointed him ‚Äòchief engineer of all castles, forts, and fortifications within Wales,‚Äô at a salary of ¬£240 per annum. Subsequently, he was appointed the king's principal engineer for fortifications, and in 1635 he visited Portsmouth in this capacity to settle a question between the governor and the admiralty as to the removal of some naval buildings which interfered with proposed fortifications. In 1638 he visited Guernsey and Jersey at the request of the governors, Charles Danvers, Earl of Danby and Sir Thomas Jermyn, to survey the castles in those islands and report upon them to the board of ordnance. In February of the following year Rudd petitioned the board of ordnance for the payment of arrears of salary; in June the board recommended the petition to the council, mentioning Rudd's services. In April, having been employed in making a survey of the Portsmouth defences, he recommended that they should be reconstructed at an estimated cost of ¬£4,956. In June Rudd went to Dover to superintend the repairs to the harbour and to the Archcliffe bulwark or fort, and in October he reported to the council that the works were delayed for want of funds, and suggested that the revenues of the harbour, as well as the dues, should be devoted to the maintenance of the harbour and fort. To this the council assented on 29 May 1640, and on 31 December following directed all mayors, sheriffs, and justices to impress workmen in and about London and elsewhere for the works at Dover, which had been entrusted to Rudd. In October 1640 Rudd went to Portsmouth to finish the fortifications, on the special application of Colonel Goring, the governor, and he divided his attention during 1641 between Portsmouth and Dover. The work at Portsmouth was retarded for want of funds, and in January 1642 the governor demanded stores, and leave to use materials for fortification, according to Rudd's survey of the previous year. Rudd served as chief engineer on the royalist side throughout the First English Civil War, and in 1655 his estate at Higham Ferrers was decimated on an assessment for the payment of the militia, as a punishment for his adherence to the royalist cause. He died in 1656, aged 72, and was buried in Higham Ferrers church, where several epitaphs composed by himself were inscribed on his tomb. Works Rudd put his name to two texts on geometry, Practical Geometry, in two parts (London, 1650), and an edition of Euclid's Elements under the title Euclides Elements of Geometry, the first six Books in a compendious form contrasted and demonstrated, whereunto is added the Mathematical Preface of Mr. John Dee (London, 1651), but both works show extensive appropriation (without attribution) from Dutch sources of the early 1600s. In particular, Rudd's selection of a hundred questions is largely, but not exclusively, culled from the compilation of Sybrandt Hanszoon van Harlingen (Cardinael) (1578‚Äì1647), Hondert Geometische Questien [A Hundred Geometrical Problems], published c. 1612. He wrote the supplement to The Compleat Body of the Art Military, by Lieutenant-colonel Richard Elton, London, 1650; 2nd edit. 1659. This supplement consists of six chapters, dealing with the duties of officers, the marching of troops and the art of gunnery. Sir James Turner, in his Pallas Armata (1683), refers to another work by Rudd on sieges; but this cannot now be traced. * T. Rudd, Practical Geometry, in Two Parts: The first, Shewing how to perform four Species of Arithmetick, (viz. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division,) together with Reduction, and the Rule of Proportion in figures.

He contributed to the development of front-wheel-drive vehicles in two ways. The first way was in developing and promoting the Tracta joint (designed by his friend Pierre FenailleEuropean Patent FR628309), which was, until manufacturing techniques had progressed sufficiently to allow the successful manufacture of the constant velocity joints commonly in use today, the preferred choice of most manufactures of vehicles that had driven front wheels. Tracta joints were used by many of the pioneers of front-wheel drive, including DKW between 1929 and 1936 and Adler from 1932 to 1939 as well as the cars designed by J A Gr√©goire that will be mentioned later. The Tracta joint was fitted to most of the military vehicles that had driven front wheels used by most of the combatants in the Second World War. They included Laffly and Panhard in France, Alvis and Daimler in the UK and Willys in the United States that used the joint in a quarter of a million Jeeps and many others. This was to continue after the war, the first Land Rover being so fitted. The second way he contributed to the development of front-wheel-drive vehicles was in designing and in some cases manufacturing front-wheel-drive cars. The Tracta Gephi was his first design and it was this car that inspired him to design a constant velocity joint. All subsequent Tracta cars, and there were about two hundred manufactured between 1927 and 1932, used it. The first of these was raced at Le Mans in 1927 completing the 24-hour race. The Tracta cars used engines from S.C.A.P. from 1100 cc to 1600 cc, and Continental and Hotchkiss, from 2700 cc to 3300 cc. J.A. Gr√©goire designed an 11cv 6-cylinder car for Donnet in 1932. Only four prototypes were produced, one being shown at the Paris Salon of 1932 before Donnet went into liquidation. He then worked with Lucian Chenard to design two cars for Chenard et Walcker. They were of advanced design but were not a commercial success. In 1937 he designed the Amilcar Compound, produced by Hotchkiss from 1938 to the Second World War, by which time 681 examples had been made. It was constructed using another of Gr√©goire's ideas, a cast Alpax (light alloy) chassis frame. Other advanced features were rack and pinion steering and all independent suspension. But the car had its bad points, cable brakes and gear-change linkage and a side-valve engine although the latter was still common at this time. An overhead valve version came later. During the Second World War he secretly worked with his design team at his works at Asni√®res-sur-Seine on a small car the Aluminium \\"Francais-Gr√©goire\\". It had a chassis-body frame of light alloy, front-wheel drive, an air-cooled flat twin engine and independent suspension on all wheels. A four-seat car weighing only and could reach while returning 70 mpg. This design was to form the basis of the 1950 \\"Dyna\\" Panhard. In 1950 another Hotchkiss car the \\"Hotchkiss-Gr√©goire\\", was produced again with an alloy chassis and body. With independent suspension on all four wheels and fitted with a water-cooled flat four engine of 2 litres, ahead of the front axle, it was fast, with a top speed of , but the car was expensive and only 250 examples were made by 1954. In 1956 Gr√©goire produced a two-seat convertible with a 2.2-litre supercharged flat-four engine producing and, as in the case of the cars mentioned previously, front-wheel drive. All ten cars made were fitted with bodies designed and built by Henri Chapron. All the cars mentioned previously were front-wheel-drive cars. Gr√©goire also designed a couple of rear-wheel-drive machines: the first electric car with the machinery in the mid-engine position and a gas turbine car, the experimental SOCEMA-Gr√©goire with a front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout.

He is best known for his painting in the city hall of Amsterdam and paintings for the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp for whom he worked for more than 30 years, also as an art dealer. Life Ovens was born and grew up in T√∂nning, Duchy of Schleswig, the son of FrisianSchmidt, p. 7 farmer and alderman Ove Broders and Agneta Ovens (also called Broders). Although that duchy was formally a Danish fief, Ovens is often counted among German painters.Schmidt, p. 286 Exhibition catalogue. Since 1640 he worked for Hendrick van Uylenburgh with Govaert Flinck in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. It has been suggested he went to Italy between 1643 and 1649, but there is no evidence. Until 1651, he lived in Amsterdam, then from May 1651 he went back to Schleswig-Holstein, claimed by Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. In 1652 he married Maria Jens Martens (daughter of a rich T√∂nning alderman) in Friedrichstadt. His father-in-law gave him 60,000 Thaler, but demanded that he settle down nearby. Jacob Fighting the Angel, Nationalmuseum In 1654 Ovens spent a few weeks in Stockholm to paint the marriage between Charles X Gustav and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. In 1655 Gerrit van Uylenburgh came to visit him. In 1657 Ovens travelled to Amsterdam because of a war between the Swedish and the Danish. He cooperated with Govert Flinck. Ovens became a citizen of Amsterdam in order to start a business or to get a job, as the rules of guilds were very strict. He send statues by Artus Quellinus the Elder to Gottorf. Ovens was living in the Jordaan in a canalhouse with a large studio under the roof. He rented out the cellar as a public house, just like Flinck did, who used to own it and died the year before. The art-dealer Gerrit van Uylenburgh bought the house next door owned by Flinck. Johannes Lingelbach was a friend and a witness when his children were baptized in the Lutheran church. In 1661 Ovens was asked to finish a painting begun by Flinck. The painting had to be placed in the town hall, within a few days, when Rembrandt's painting The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis was rejected. Ovens was paid 48 guilders, very little compared to the others, but still a good salary in those days. In 1663 Ovens returned to Friedrichstadt at the instruction of Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, as one of the richest inhabitants. He invited Johannes Voorhout to work for him, but the painter declined the offer. From 1674 to 1675, he lived again in Holland and painted Michiel de Ruyter and Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen. After returning to Schleswig he painted the altarpiece of St. Christopher's in Friedrichstadt, painting himself in its top right section. His grave is also in the church. Ovens owned six painting by Anthony van Dyk and three by Jacob Jordaens, Rubens, etc.F. Lammertse & J. van der Veen (2006) Uylenburh & Zoon.

He made 45 paintings for the Amalienburg in Gottorf. The Earl of Arundel (or his grandmother Aletheia Talbot?) owned seventeen paintings by Ovens, belonging to a collection of 78 paintings which were sold on September 26, 1684 in Amsterdam. According to Schmidt there is nothing German in his paintings and he belongs to the Dutch School of painting.

Marine Drive, the former route of the Tramway. The tramway was opened in 1896 by the New General Traction Company and operated until 1939. It never reopened after the war, and was largely lifted and destroyed by 1955. One of the motor cars was retrieved for preservation at the National Tramway Museum at Crich in Derbyshire, where it resides to this day. There is little left of the line as it was, save for the castellated entrance to the Marine Drive itself. The tramway's sheds and workshops were located mid-way along the line at Little Ness, together with the power station for generating the electricity but this was filled in and is now a car park. The roadway has been closed for several years owing to a number of serious landslides, but in the 1960s the local authority of Douglas Corporation attempted to rejuvenate the area by introducing a bus service on the coastal route. However, it was short- lived owing to further landslides which made the road unsafe. Today parts of the route can be used by motor traffic, but a stretch north of Little Ness is only open to pedestrians. The route of this railway provides views of the Irish Sea, and forms part of the Isle of Man's coastal footpath Raad ny Foillan (Way of the Gull), created in 1986.

In latter years there have been various attempts to rejuvenate the area, all of which have been unsuccessful to date. It still has a station on the steam railway. The beach area had its own small promenade and hotel (latterly named \\"The Anchor\\" but now closed and abandoned), a suspended walkway (now closed and deemed unsafe), former oyster beds and sealion pool, a large building formerly housing an amusement arcade, paddling pool (long since filled in by shingle from the incoming tide), and access to the nearby glen of the same name. These days the place is something of a ghost town, disturbed only by the occasional dog walker, but it once had its own funicular railway linking the sea level resort with the Douglas Head Marine Drive Railway atop the cliffs above, the remnants of which can still be traced today. Former leisure facility The entire site was purchased in the 1990s by Pacini Ltd (a subsidiary of De Beers) and the entire land was leased to Port Soderick Leisure Ltd, a company established by Andrew Evans of Douglas, with the sole purpose of rebuilding much of the site and operating a water sports facility there: primarily scuba diving, sailing, canoeing and jet ski rentals. The original building was gutted save for the original sprung dance floor, and was converted for the most part into the Anchor pub. The centre opened with much support from local people, and was very popular during the summer. Pacini had however inadvertently leased the small wooden cafe on the site to a separate party who enforced their contract to be the sole supplier of food to the area. Thus robbed of the lucrative profits from food as alcohol consumption fell due to social concerns, the centre's financial viability was stretched. Pacini decided to pull all future funding; this resulted in the lease being given up and control handed to the cafe proprietor, who abandoned the water sports and ran the pub for a short while before closing its doors for good. The site has limitations mainly associated with decay of the building structures due to lack of maintenance and vandalism and the general deterioration of the old coastal walkways. In addition there is no sewer connection at the site and the sea outfall has long been destroyed.

He is the owner of Dallara Motorsports, a company that develops racing cars. Biography Dallara was born in Parma. = Automotive and motorsport = He graduated from Politecnico di Milano, majoring in aeronautical engineering. He joined Ferrari in 1960, and next year moved to Maserati. In 1963 he was hired by Lamborghini as their chief designer, where he (along with Paolo Stanzani, and Bob Wallace) designed the chassis of the Lamborghini Espada and Miura. In 1969 he started to design race cars for Frank Williams, founder and manager of the WilliamsF1 Formula One team. In 1972, Dallara founded and established Dallara Automobili in Parma, Italy. Starting from 1974, Dallara and his company started designing a Formula One car, the Iso-Marlboro IR, for the Williams Team. Another project included designing a race car to Formula 3 standards. This resulted in victories in Italy, France, England, Switzerland, Germany, Japan, United States, Russia, and Austria. In 1997 Dallara and his company expanded into IndyCar racing, with many victories from 1998 until 2003.Dallara profile in IndyCar Beginning in 2007, Dallara has been the single chassis supplier for IndyCar. Dallara later branched out into F1 projects in the mid-1990s, but by the end of 1998, Honda, coming to the new project as full constructor, called on Dallara to design the new F1 chassis for BAR-Honda. Later Honda cancelled this project. Giotto Bizzarrini, Ferruccio Lamborghini and Dallara at Sant'Agata Bolognese in 1963, with a Lamborghini V12 engine prototype. Begin in 2000, after the cancellation of the Honda project, Dallara embarked on a new project. He and his team were to build a race car for French team, Oreca in Le Mans series. In the August 2004, it was announced that Dallara and his team were signed by Alex Shnaider to build a chassis for the erstwhile Jordan team, Midland.Midland MF1 Team profile Later, Dallara brought along Gary Anderson to handle this project. But by mid-2005, Dallara pulled out from the project. In 2009, Dallara and his team began a project building an F1 chassis for the new team, Campos Grand Prix, known now as Hispania.Dallara says F1 challenge fascinating = Association Football = In 2015 Dallara became investor in the phoenix club Parma Calcio 1913 along with Guido Barilla and Mauro Del Rio.

Specifically, given a set of real numbers known to a given precision, an integer relation algorithm will either find an integer relation between them, or will determine that no integer relation exists with coefficients whose magnitudes are less than a certain upper bound.Since the set of real numbers can only be specified up to a finite precision, an algorithm that did not place limits on the size of its coefficients would always find an integer relation for sufficiently large coefficients. Results of interest occur when the size of the coefficients in an integer relation is small compared to the precision with which the real numbers are specified.  History  For the case n = 2, an extension of the Euclidean algorithm can find any integer relation that exists between any two real numbers x1 and x2. The algorithm generates successive terms of the continued fraction expansion of x1/x2; if there is an integer relation between the numbers, then their ratio is rational and the algorithm eventually terminates. *The Ferguson‚ÄìForcade algorithm was published in 1979 by Helaman Ferguson and R.W. Forcade.

P. Ferguson, David H. Bailey and Steve Arno, ANALYSIS OF PSLQ, AN INTEGER RELATION FINDING ALGORITHM: *The LLL algorithm has been improved by numerous authors. Modern LLL implementations can solve integer relation problems with n above 500. Applications Integer relation algorithms have numerous applications. The first application is to determine whether a given real number x is likely to be algebraic, by searching for an integer relation between a set of powers of x {1, x, x2, ..., xn}. The second application is to search for an integer relation between a real number x and a set of mathematical constants such as e, œÄ and ln(2), which will lead to an expression for x as a linear combination of these constants. A typical approach in experimental mathematics is to use numerical methods and arbitrary precision arithmetic to find an approximate value for an infinite series, infinite product or an integral to a high degree of precision (usually at least 100 significant figures), and then use an integer relation algorithm to search for an integer relation between this value and a set of mathematical constants. If an integer relation is found, this suggests a possible closed- form expression for the original series, product or integral. This conjecture can then be validated by formal algebraic methods. The higher the precision to which the inputs to the algorithm are known, the greater the level of confidence that any integer relation that is found is not just a numerical artifact. A notable success of this approach was the use of the PSLQ algorithm to find the integer relation that led to the Bailey‚ÄìBorwein‚ÄìPlouffe formula for the value of . PSLQ has also helped find new identities involving multiple zeta functions and their appearance in quantum field theory; and in identifying bifurcation points of the logistic map. For example, where B4 is the logistic map's fourth bifurcation point, the constant Œ± = ‚àíB4(B4 ‚àí 2) is a root of a 120th-degree polynomial whose largest coefficient is 25730.David H.

Venerated as a guru (teacher) in the region of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and mainly Punjab. He was a poet-saint, social reformer and a spiritual figure. The life details of Ravidas are uncertain and contested. Scholars believe he was born in 1450 CE, in a family that worked with dead animals' skins to produce leather products. Ravidas's devotional songs were included in the Sikh scriptures known as Guru Granth Sahib.Callewaert and Friedlander, The Life and Works of Ravidass Ji, Manohar, Delhi, 1992, quoted in Gavin Flood, An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge 1996. The Panch Vani text of the Dadupanthi tradition within Hinduism also includes numerous poems of Ravidas. He taught removal of social divisions of caste and gender, and promoted unity in the pursuit of personal spiritual freedoms.  Life  The details of Ravidas's life are not well known. Scholars state he was born in 1450 CE and died in 1520 CE. Ravidas was also known as Raidas. He was born in the village of Seer Goverdhanpur, near Varanasi in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India. His birthplace is now known as Shri Guru Ravidas Janam Asthan. Mata Kalsa‚Äôn was his mother, and his father was Santokh Dass. His parents belonged to a leather-working Chamar community making them an untouchable caste. While his original occupation was leather work, he began to spend most of his time in spiritual pursuits at the banks of the Ganges. Thereafter he spent most of his life in the company of Sufi saints, sadhus and ascetics. The text Anantadas Parcai is one of the earliest surviving biographies of various Bhakti movement poets which talks about the birth of Ravidas. Medieval era texts, such as the Bhaktamal suggest that Ravidas was not the disciple of the Brahmin bhakti-poet Ramananda.David Lorenzen (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, , page 268 He is traditionally considered as Kabir's younger contemporary.James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, , page 569 However, the medieval text titled Ratnavali says Ravidas gained his spiritual knowledge from Ramananda and was a follower of the Ramanandi Sampradaya tradition. His ideas and fame grew over his lifetime, and texts suggest Brahmins (members of priestly upper caste) used to bow before him. He travelled extensively, visiting Hindu pilgrimage sites in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and those in the Himalayas. He abandoned saguna (with attributes, image) forms of supreme beings, and focussed on the nirguna (without attributes, abstract) form of supreme beings. As his poetic hymns in regional languages inspired others, people from various background sought his teachings and guidance. Most scholars believe that Ravidas met Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. He is revered in the Sikh scripture, and 41 of Ravidas' poems are included in the Adi Granth. These poems are one of the oldest attested source of his ideas and literary works. Another substantial source of legends and stories about the life of Ravidas is the hagiography in the Sikh tradition, named Premambodha. This text, composed over 150 years after Ravidas' death, in 1693, includes him as one of the seventeen saints of Indian religious tradition. The 17th-century Nabhadas's Bhaktamal, and the Parcais of Anantadas, both contain chapters on Ravidas.Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , pages 1-4 Other than these, the scriptures and texts of Sikh tradition and the Hindu Dadupanthi traditions, most other written sources about the life of Ravidas, including by the Ravidasi (followers of Ravidas), were composed in the early 20th century, or about 400 years after his death. Callewaert, Winand. (2003), Pilgrims, Patrons, and Place: Localizing Sanctity in Asian Religions (Editors: Phyllis Granoff and Koichi Shinohara), University of British Columbia Press, , pages 203-223 This text, called the Parcaƒ´s (or Parchais), included Ravidas among the sants whose biography and poems were included. Over time new manuscripts of Parcais of Anantadas were reproduced, some in different local languages of India. Winnand Callewaert notes that some 30 manuscripts of Anantadas's hagiography on Ravidas have been found in different parts of India.Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , pages 303-307 Of these four manuscripts are complete, collated and have been dated to 1662, 1665, 1676 and 1687. The first three are close with some morphological variants without affecting the meaning, but the 1687 version systematically inserts verses into the text, at various locations, with caste-related statements, new claims of Brahmins persecuting Ravidas, notes on the untouchability of Ravidas, claims of Kabir giving Ravidas ideas, ridicules of nirguni and saguni ideas, and such text corruption:Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , pages 316-334 Callewaert considers the 1676 version as the standard version, his critical edition of Ravidas's hagiography excludes all these insertions, and he remarks that the cleaner critical version of Anantadas's parcais suggests that there is more in common in the ideas of bhakti movement's Ravidas, Kabir and Sen than previously thought. Khare similarly has questioned the textual sources on Ravidas, and mentions there are few \\"readily available and reliable textual sources on the Hindu and Untouchable treatment of Ravidas.\\"Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, , pages 41-47  Literary works  The Adi Granth of Sikhs, and Panchvani of the Hindu warrior-ascetic group Dadupanthis are the two oldest attested sources of the literary works of Ravidas. In the Adi Granth, forty of Ravidas's poems are included, and he is one of thirty six contributors to this foremost canonical scripture of Sikhism.Pashaura Singh (2012), Fighting Words: Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts (Editor: John Renard), University of California Press, , pages 202-207GS Chauhan (2009), Bani Of Bhagats, Hemkunt Press, , pages 41-55 This compilation of poetry in Adi Granth responds to, among other things, issues of dealing with conflict and tyranny, war and resolution, and willingness to dedicate one's life to the right cause. Ravidas's poetry covers topics such as the definition of a just state where there are no second or third class unequal citizens, the need for dispassion, and who is a real Yogi.J Kaur (2005), The Concept of Peace and the Guru Granth Sahib, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Volume 66, Number 3, pages 649-660 Jeffrey Ebbesen notes that, just like other bhakti saint-poets of India and some cases of Western literature authorship, many poems composed by later era Indian poets have been attributed to Ravidas, as an act of reverence, even though Ravidas has had nothing to do with these poems or ideas expressed therein.Jeffrey Ebbesen (1995), Literary India: Comparative Studies in Aesthetics, Colonialism, and Culture (Editors: Patrick Colm Hogan, Lalita Pandit), State University of New York Press, , pages 53-55 = Ravidas literature on symbolism = Peter Friedlander states that Ravidas' hagiographies, though authored long after he died, depict a struggle within the Indian society, where Ravidas' life gives the means to express a variety of social and spiritual themes. At one level, it depicts a struggle between the then prevalent heterodox communities and the orthodox Brahminical tradition. At another level, the legends are an inter-communal, inter-religious struggle with an underlying search and desire for social unity. At yet another level, states Friedlander, the stories describe the spiritual struggle of an individual unto self.Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, , pages 106-114 There is no historical evidence to verify the historicity in these hagiographies, which range from Ravidas's struggle with Hindu Brahmins,Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, , pages 109-110 to his struggle with Muslim Sultan Sikander Lodi.Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, , pages 108, 112-117 Friedlander states that the stories reflect the social dynamics that influenced the composers of the hagiographies during the 17th- to 20th-century. These are legends where Ravidas is victorious because God intervened with miracles such as making a stone float in water, or making river Ganges to reverse course and flow upstream. David Lorenzen similarly states that poetry attributed to Ravidas, and championed by Ravidasi (his followers) from the 17th- through the 20th- century, have a strong anti-Brahminical and anti-communal theme. The legends, suggests Lorenzen, cannot be separated from the power and political situation of this era, and they reflect a strong element of social and religious dissent by groups marginalised during a period when Indian society was under the Islamic rule and later the colonial rule.David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, , pages 105-116, 292-303  Philosophy  The songs of Ravidas discuss Nirguna-Saguna themes, as well as ideas that are at the foundation of Nath Yoga philosophy of Hinduism. He frequently mentions the term Sahaj, a mystical state where there is a union of the truths of the many and the one. David Lorenzen states Ravidas's poetry is imbued with themes of boundless loving devotion to God, wherein this divine is envisioned as Nirguna.David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, , page 107 In the Sikh tradition, the themes of Nanak's poetry are very broadly similar to the Nirgun bhakti ideas of Ravidas and other leading north Indian saint- poets.Neeti M Sadarangani (2004), Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact, Swarup & Sons, , pages i-xv, 115, 55-60, 72-76Christopher Shackle (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, , page 111 Most postmodern scholars, states Karen Pechilis, consider Ravidas's ideas to belong to the Nirguna philosophy within the bhakti movement.Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 21 =Monistic Brahman or Anthropomorphic God= Multiple manuscripts found in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, dated to be from the 18th and 19th centuries, contain a theosophical debate between Kabir and Ravidas on the nature of the Absolute, more specifically whether the Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Eternal Truth) is monistic Oneness or a separate anthropomorphic incarnate. Kabir argues for the former. Ravidas, in contrast, argues from the latter premise to the effect that both are one. In these manuscripts, Kabir initially prevails, Ravidas accepts that Brahman is monistic, but till the end Kabir didn't accept worshipping a divine avatar (sagun conception).David Lorenzen (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, , pages 169-170 =One man: two divergent claims on his views and philosophy= Ravindra KhareRavindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, , pages 41, 46 states that there are two divergent versions that emerge from the study of texts relating to Ravidas's philosophy. The 17th century Bhaktamal text by Nabhadas provides one version, while the 20th-century texts by Dalits (the modern term for those previously called \\"untouchables\\") provide another. According to Bhaktamal text, Ravidas was of pure speech, capable of resolving spiritual doubts of those who held discussions with him, was unafraid to state his humble origins and real caste. Further, the Bhaktamal text states that Ravidas's teachings agreed with Vedic and ancient scriptures, he subscribed to nondualism, discussed spiritual ideas and philosophy with everyone including Brahmins without gender or caste discrimination, and his abilities reflected an individual who had reached the inner content state of the highest ascetic.Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, , pages 41-45 The 20th- century version, prevalent in the texts of Dalit community, concurs with the parts about pure speech and resolving spiritual doubts. However, they differ in the rest. The texts and the prevalent beliefs of the Dalit community hold that Ravidas rejected the Hindu Vedas, he was opposed by the Brahmins and resisted by the caste Hindus as well as Hindu ascetics throughout his life, and that some members of the Dalit community have believed Ravidas was an idol worshipper (saguni bhakti saint) while other 20th century texts assert that Ravidas rejected idolatry.Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, , pages 46-53, 163-164 For example, the following hymn of Ravidas, present in Guru Granth Sahib, support such claims where he rejects Vedas and the belief that taking a ritualistic bath can make someone pure.  Legacy  A procession in Bedford, the United Kingdom by Ravidasias to mark the birthday of Ravidas. = Ravidassia religion= The difference between the Ravidassia religion and Sikhism, as described by a post made by Shri Guru Ravidass Temple in Ontario is as follows: > We, as Ravidassias have different traditions. We are not Sikhs. Even though, > we give utmost respect to 10 gurus and Guru Granth Sahib, Guru Ravidass Ji > is our supreme. There is no command for us to follow the declaration that > there is no Guru after Guru Granth Sahib.

Ravidass, Dera Sachkhand Ballan and the Question of Dalit Identity > in Punjab. JPS, 16(1), 2. Ravidassia religion is a spin-off religion from Sikhism, formed in the 21st century, by the followers of Ravidass's teachings. It was formed following the murder of their cleric Ramanand Dass in Vienna in 2009, where the movement declared itself to be a religion fully separated from Sikhism. The Ravidassia religion compiled a new holy book, Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji. Based entirely on the writings and teaching of Ravidas, it contains 240 hymns. Sant Niranjan Dass is the head of Dera Sachkhand Ballan. Kathryn Lum summarises the dynamics behind the separation of Ravidassia religion and Sikhism, and its focus on Ravidas, as follows: =Places of worship= A Guru Ravidass temple in the UK. Ravidas is revered as a saint and well respected by his believers. He is considered by his devotees as someone who was the living symbol of religious protest, and not as the spiritual symbol of any ultimate unifying cultural principle.Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, , pages 48-49, 41-53 = Politics = Prime Minister Narendra Modi offers prayers at Shri Guru Ravidas Janmsthan Mandir A political party was founded in India in 2012 by the followers of Ravidass, with the word Begumpura (Be-gam-pura, or \\"land without sorrow\\"), a term coined in a poem by Ravidas.

It was directed by Vladimir Khotinenko and produced by Nikita Mikhalkov. The film was released on 1 November 2007, to coincide with the celebrations of National Unity Day on 4 November that marks the expulsion of Polish troops from Moscow. Plot The film is set in Russia during the Time of Troubles, a period of civil disorder, famine and Polish invasion that followed the fall of the Rurik dynasty, which had ruled Russia in various capacities from 862 to 1598. The protagonist, Andrey, had been a servant at Tsar Boris Godunov's court while he was a boy, where he became the sole witness to the murder of the Tsar's family by the order of plotting boyars. Andrey is then sold to slavery. Now, seven years later, he is bought by a Spanish mercenary, Alvaro Borja, who seeks to profit from this war by fighting for the Polish invading army. The company falls prey to a band of robbers and Alvaro is killed. Andrey and his friend Kostka know that serfs without a master are considered like runaways and will be hanged. Andrey disguises himself in his dead master's clothes and assumes his name, taking the guise of a \\"Spanish knight.\\" Andrey is hired by the Polish Lord Kybowsky, who wants to capture Moscow and use Princess Xenia Godunova to raise himself to the Crown. As they approach a city, Andrey protects a Russian girl from the Polish soldiers. Andrey's true identity is discovered and he is arrested. Kostka however frees Andrey and steals Princess Xenia (she drank sleeping medicine) and with the help of his Russian girlfriend, they sneak over to the Russian garrison. Unfortunately the Russians tell them that Prince Dmitri Pozharsky had led most of the troops to Moscow with all the city cannons. Andrey then makes a cannon of leather. At dawn, the Polish army demands the city's surrender. Andrey fires a hot cannonball into the Polish ammunition storage, which explodes, killing most of the army surrounding the fortress. The next day, more Poles arrive and attack the city, but the Russians hold firm. Kybowsky orders all the cannon on the gate breaking a way into the city. Meanwhile, Andrey moves their cannon off the wall and to the gate. The Husaria begin to charge. Andrey loads a chain shot into the cannon and they fire as the enemy closes, decapitating the Polish Hussars. The gate collapses and the rest begin to flee. Kybowsky calls Andrey to negotiations, saying that if Xenia does not come out herself, he will kill her daughter. Andrey himself leads her out of the city. Soon Andrey joins the Russians at Moscow. The Battle for Moscow lasts for three days. The Polish flee in defeat and Kybowsky is captured. Andrey calls him to a duel and kills him. The Russian nobles are angry at Xenia because she had converted to Catholicism, and send her to live in a monastery. Soon, a new Tsar is elected, Michael Romanov, whose dynasty rules Russia for the next 300 years. Historical accuracy The film is based on historical events and includes some fictional elements. According to the anti-Putin opposition coalition The Other Russia, \\"most of the history [in the film] has been diluted beyond recognition\\". The movie takes artistic freedom with real events. In the film, Polish troops are thrown back from Moscow, but they actually held the city for two years. Also, Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, who were instrumental in organizing the popular uprising that led to the expulsion of Polish-Lithuanian forces, appear only briefly at the movie's conclusion. Controversy Critics of the Kremlin have compared it to Soviet propaganda. Questions were raised about the alleged anti-Polonism of the movie, but the film's director, interviewed in the Polish as well as Russian press, stressed that the movie was in no way intended to defame Poles. The director, Vladimir Khotinenko, claimed it was made for entertainment purposes as well as to raise awareness of the new holiday among the general public. International as well as Russian critics suggest that the movie, which was commissioned by the Kremlin, showcases key political ideas pushed by the Kremlin in advance of the parliamentary elections of December 2007: the necessity of strong leadership, the treachery of foreigners, and the importance of patriotism. The Time of Troubles, as portrayed in the film, represents the last decade of the 20th century, when Russia was undergoing severe hardships. Khotinenko was quoted as saying, \\"It's important for me that the audience feel pride. That they didn't regard it as something that happened in ancient history but as a recent event. That they felt the link between what happened 400 years ago and today.\\" References  External links  Category:2000s historical adventure films Category:Russian films Category:Russian historical adventure films Category:2007 films Category:Films set in the 1610s Category:Films set in Russia Category:Films set in Moscow Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic Category:Films directed by Vladimir Khotinenko ","title":"1612 (film)"},{"id":"13644077","text":"Lorenzo Lotto's portrait of Andrea Odoni, 1527 Paolo Veronese and workshop, The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine of Alexandria, c. 1562-9 Titian, Portrait of Jacopo Sannazaro, c. 1514-18 Giulio Romano, Portrait of Margherita Palaeologa, c.1531 Jacopo Bassano's Christ carrying the cross is now in the National Gallery, London. The Dutch Gift of 1660See below for earlier gifts was a collection of 28 mostly Italian Renaissance paintings and 12 classical sculptures, along with a yacht, the Mary, and furniture, which was presented to King Charles II of England by the States-General of the Netherlands in 1660.Whittaker and Clayton: pp. 31-2 for the art, Gleissner for the furniture and yacht. The yacht was the gift of the Dutch East India Company, according to Liverpool Museums (with model) , or the City of Amsterdam according to other sources. The collection was given to Charles II to mark his return to power in the English Restoration, before which Charles had spent many years in exile in Paris, Cologne, and the Spanish Netherlands, during the rule of the English Commonwealth. It was intended to strengthen diplomatic relations between England and the Republic, but only a few years after the gift the two nations would be at war again in the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665-67\\\\. Most of the paintings and all the Roman sculptures were from the Reynst collection, the most important seventeenth-century Dutch collection of paintings of the Italian sixteenth century, formed in Venice by Jan Reynst (1601-1646) and extended by his brother, Gerrit Reynst (1599-1658).Emil Jacobs, \\"Das Museo Vendramin under die Sammlung Reynst\\", Repertorium f√ºr Kunstwissenschaft, 46 (1925:15-38), noted in Denis Mahon I p. 303 note 1. Mahon notes that the Reynst collection was as well known for its antiquities as for its paintings (Mahon p 304 note 14). See also Halbertsma on the sculpture, and Logan on the collection as a whole. The gift reflected the taste Charles shared with his father, Charles I, whose large collection, one of the most magnificent in Europe, had mostly been sold abroad after he was executed in 1649.The tradition that many of the paintings had previously been in Charles I's collection, disseminated by George Vertue in the eighteenth century and often repeated was laid to rest by Denis Mahon 1949 -- see Mahon I. Charles II was not as keen a collector as his father, but appreciated art and was later able to recover a good number of the items from the pre-war collection that remained in England, as well as purchasing many further paintings, and many significant old master drawings.Lloyd, Christopher, The Queen's Pictures, Royal Collectors through the centuries, (National Gallery Publications) 1991, p. 75 Some decades later, there was a reverse movement when 36 paintings from the English Royal Collection, including at least one of those given in 1660, were taken by the Dutch King William III of England to his Dutch palace of Het Loo. His successor to the throne, Queen Anne, tried to recover these after William's death in 1702, but failed, and they mostly remain in Dutch public collections.Lloyd, p.75 Fourteen paintings from the 1660 gift remain in the Royal Collection, with others now in different collections around the world. The gift The 24 Italian paintings and the 12 sculptures had been part of the Reynst Collection assembled by Gerrit Reynst (also known as Gerard Reynst) and his brother Jan Reynst, who had been based in Venice for many years. Much of the collection originated from the famous Vendramin family collection there, though others had been acquired separately.Mahon I, p.303 After the death of Gerrit Reynst in 1658, his widow sold a selection of the finest works in the collection to the States-General in 1660 for the then considerable sum of 80,000 guilders. In 1660 this group and twelve Roman sculptures was presented to Charles II, augmented by four non-Italian works. The gift was organized by the regents, especially the powerful Cornelis de Graeff and his younger brother Andries. The sculptures for the gift were selected by the pre- eminent sculptor in the Netherlands, Artus Quellinus, and Gerrit van Uylenburgh, the son of Rembrandt's dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh, advised the States-General on the purchase. Much later he was to flee from financial difficulties to England and become Surveyor of the King's Pictures to Charles, from 1676 until his death three years later.Church Times, August 11, 2006 The gift was unpopular with many of the Dutch people, and became a bone of contention between the Dutch political factions.Broekman and Helmers In July 1660 Louis of Nassau arrived in London; his countrymen Simon van Hoorn, curator of the Athenaeum Illustre, Michiel van Gogh from Vlissingen and Baron Joachim Ripperda van Farmsum arrived in November to negotiate the Act of Navigation and to present Charles II the Gift.European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies, ed.

Vsevolod's father was Alexander Holubovych (Aug. 25, 1846 - Nov. 28, 1902) and his mother Iryna Ovsiyevna Yefremovych (Apr.29, 1859 - Oct.2, 1921). Born into a priest family, Holubovych as was expected to start his education in the Podolie Spiritual Seminary of Ivan Bohoslov (Kamyanets- Podilsky). Remarkable is the fact that the same seminary was attended by another future Prime Minister of Ukraine, Volodymyr Chekhivsky as a teacher. Vsevolod by the end of his studies in the seminary started to be interested in the political life in the country and in 1903 joined the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. Vsevolod decided to deviate from his family occupation, enrolling in the Engineering Department of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute (KPI). In 1905 he was arrested for the first time and was excluded from the university. It took his mother's influence and connections to refrain Vsevolod from interrogations and reinstatement back into university. The administration of KPI reviewed her son's case and charged him with a simple administrative warning. Vsevolod was allowed to complete his studies in 1915 when Holubovych finally received his diploma in civil engineering (road network specialization). Considering all the complications that involved to reinstate him back in school, he nonetheless chose to ignore the warning and together with his friend Ivan Nemolovsky, who just returned from Belgium, established the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary underground group. The party has already was earning the popularity amongst various categories of population in the Russian Empire and especially in the Ukrainian lands. Professional life Upon graduating Holubovych got a job as a professional railway engineer at the Southern Railways. Still in school, in 1914 he already worked as an assistant manager at a some station in Kharkov Governorate. According to his family documents as an assistant to the railway division in Odessa, Holubovych was receiving 1500 rubles pay and 375 rubles in living allowances. In September 1917 he was the chief of the department of water, highway, and road communications for the Romanian Front. In spring 1917 Holubovych created an Odessa department of the Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party (UPSR) amongst the railway workers of the Odessa network. As the leader of that party he was elected to the Odessa City Council (Duma) and by April 1917 Holubovych headed the council. Revolution He was a member of the Odessa Ukrainian Hromada, from the name of which he sent a petition to the Russian Provisional Government to give Ukraine its territorial autonomy. Due to the Soviet aggression on Ukraine without declaration of war and poor management of the State Affairs on the part of Volodymyr Vynnychenko, the Central Rada was forced to appoint Vsevolod Holubovych as the head of Ukrainian government on January 31, 1918. Holubovych also headed the Ukrainian delegation to Brest- Litovsk and negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (February 9, 1918). After a German-backed coup, which installed Pavlo Skoropadsky as Hetman of Ukraine on April 29, Holubovych was arrested and convicted in kidnapping of banker A.Dobry. He was imprisoned until December 16, 1918 in Lukyanivka. In August 1920 was arrested again by the Special team of the 14th Army. A year later he was convicted to five years in prison as part of the Ukrainian SR process together with some other Ukrainian politicians such as Serhiy Ostapenko. Holubovych was amnisted right away on December 1921. In 1931 he was arrested together with his wife in Kharkiv and later convicted now as part of the famous Ukrainian national center and imprisoned in Yaroslavl, Russian SFSR. He died in imprisonment in 1939. Family Alexander Kochanowsky (Kharkiv, 1928) * Alexander Kochanowsky (), a nephew, electrical-engineer (Kharkiv Technological Institute).

As a religious, she was called Sister Mary of the Cross. She and Maximin Giraud were the two Marian visionaries of Our Lady of La Salette. Biography =Early age= Calvat was born on 7 November 1831 in Corps en Is√®re, France. She was the fourth of ten children to Pierre Calvat, a stonemason and \\"pitsawyer by trade\\" who did not hesitate to take whatever job he could find in order to support his family, and Julie Barnaud, his wife. The family was so poor \\"that the young were sometimes dispatched to beg on the street\\".The Children of La Salette, Missionaries of La Salette At a very young age, Calvat was hired out to tend the neighbors' cows, where she met Maximin Giraud on the eve of their apparition. From the spring to the fall of 1846 she worked for Jean-Baptiste Pra at Les Ablandins, one of the hamlets of the village of La Salette. She only spoke the regional OccitanBert and Costa (2010: 18). dialect and fragmented French. She had neither schooling nor religious instruction, thus she could neither read or write. =Apparition= On 19 September 1846, it is related that Calvat and Maximin Giraud ‚Äì who at that time were just teenagers ‚Äì saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary in the mountains of La Salette. The apparition transmitted both a public message to them, and a personal message to each of them.Clugnet, L√©on. \\"La Salette.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 29 Dec. The bishop of Grenoble, Philibert de Bruillard, named several commissions to examine the facts. In December 1846, the first commissions were established. One was formed of professors from the major seminary of Grenoble and the other from titulary canons. The latter commission concluded that a more extensive examination was necessary before formulating a judgment. A new inquiry was held from July to September 1847, by two members of the commission, Canon Orcel, the superior of the major seminary, and Canon Rousselot.Marian Apparitions, University of Dayton A conference on the matter at the bishop's residence took place in November‚ÄìDecember 1847. Sixteen members ‚Äì the vicars general of the diocese, the parish priests of Grenoble and the titulary canons ‚Äì assembled in the presence of the bishop. The majority concluded to the authenticity of the apparition, after the examination of the report from Rousselot and Urcel. Moreover, the Bishop of Sens had examined very carefully three cures attributed to Our Lady of La Salette that had occurred in the city of Avallon. The local bishop, Mgr. Mellon Jolly, recognized on 4 May 1849, one of the three cures, which had occurred on 21 November 1847, as miraculous. Mgr. de Bruillard was convinced of the reality of the apparition and authorized the publication of the Rousselot report, which affirmed the reality of the apparition. In his letter of approbation, added as a preface, the bishop of Grenoble declared that he shared the opinion of the majority of the commission which adopted the conclusions of the report. However, Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon, on whom Grenoble depended, suspected a subterfuge. The Cardinal demanded that the children tell him their secret, saying that he had a mandate from the Pope. The children finally acceded to this demand. Calvat, however, insisted that her text be carried directly to the Pope. It was under these conditions that the Bishop of Grenoble sent two representatives to Rome. The text of the two private secrets were reportedly handed to Pope Pius IX on 18 July 1851, but apparently subsequently lost. The procedure was favourable, since the mandate of Mgr. de Bruillard, adjusted according to observations of Luigi Lambruschini, Cardinal Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Rites at Rome, was signed on 18 September 1851, and was published the following 10 November 1851. In it, the bishop of Grenoble promulgated this judgement: \\"We judge that the apparition of the Holy Virgin to the two shepherds, 19 September 1846 ... in the parish of La Salette ... carries within it all the characteristics of truth, and that the faithful have reason to believe it indubitable and certain.\\"Borrelli, Antonio. \\"Melania Seer of La Salette\\", Santi Beati, April 6, 2006 The motives of the decision, which rested on the work of Rousselot and that of the commission of 1847, were the impossibility of explaining the events, the miracles and the cures in a human manner, as well as the spiritual fruits of the apparition, notably conversions and finally the right expectations and desires of large crowds of priests and faithful. Later, 16 November 1851, the Bishop of Grenoble published a statement that the mission of the shepherd children had ended and that the matter was now in the hands of the Church. The bishop made it clear that the approval of the Church was only for the original revelation of 1846 and not for any subsequent claims. La Salette immediately stirred up a great fervour in French society, it also provoked enormous discussions. The little visionaries were somewhat disturbed by the perpetual interrogations, the threats, sometimes violent from political and ecclesiastical opponents, and also the assaults of fervour. Calvat especially was venerated in the manner of a saint, not unlike what happened to Saint Bernadette Soubirous, who, without doubting, defended herself against this. This harmed the equilibrium of the two visionaries. Calvat had difficulty living a stable religious life. Maximin, who entered the seminary, also had difficulties living a normal life. =Religious life= After the apparition in 1846, Calvat was placed as a boarder in the Sisters of Providence Convent in Corenc close to Grenoble. \\"As early as November 1847, her directress feared 'that the celebrity that had been thrust upon her might make her conceited'.\\" She entered religion at the age of twenty and in 1850 she became a postulant with this order and in October 1851 she took the veil. While at Corenc she was known to sit down surrounded by enthralled listeners, as she related stories of her childhood. In May 1853, Bishop de Bruillard died. In early 1854 his replacement refused to grant permission for her to be professed, because he found that she was not spiritually mature enough.Borelli, Antonio. \\"Melania\\", Santi e Beati, 6 April 2006 Calvat claimed that the real reason for the refusal was that the bishop was aiming to gain the favour of the emperor Napoleon III of France. Following the bishop's refusal to permit her to be professed, Calvat was officially allowed to move to a convent of the Sisters of Charity. This order was dedicated to hard practical work in helping the poor, and Calvat met brisk common sense, not flattery or adulation. Calvat continued to speak about the apparitions, and a masonic plot to destroy Catholic France. But after three weeks she was returned to Corps en Is√®re for further education. Napoleon III was ruling republican France but royalists were plotting to restore the king of the Catholic country. This political controversy dominated conversation throughout France, with the French church trying to maintain neutrality. Calvat made this difficult for the hierarchy, by continuing to repeat the reputed words of the Virgin Mary and opposing freemasonry. The bishop, aware of Melanie's fervid and outspoken royalist sympathies, was worried that she would become involved and thereby implicate the following of Our Lady of La Salette in politics. In 1854, Bishop Ginoulhiac wrote that the predictions attributed to Melanie had no basis in fact and had no importance with regard to La Salette as they came after La Salette and had nothing to do with it. Calvat agreed to the suggestion of an English visiting priest, and was allowed to move to the Carmel at Darlington in England, where she arrived in 1855. This removed her from the French political controversies, so the bishop was pleased to agree to this move. She took temporary vows there in 1856. In 1858 Calvat wrote again to the Pope to transmit that part of the secret she was authorized to reveal in that year. While at Darlington she spoke of a variety of strange events and miracles. The local bishop forbade her to speak publicly about these prophecies. In 1860, she was released from her vow of cloister at the Carmel by the PopeSt. John, Bernard, The Blessed Virgin in the Nineteenth Century: Apparitions, Revelations, Graces, p. 188, Burns & Oates, London, 1903 and returned to mainland Europe. She entered the Congregation of the Sisters of Compassion in Marseille. A sister, Marie, was appointed as her companion. After a stay in their convent of Cephalonia, Greece where she and Sister Marie went to open an orphanage, and a short sojourn at the Carmelite convent of Marseille, she returned to the Sisters of Compassion for a brief period. In October 1864 she was admitted as a novice on condition she kept her identity secret. But she was recognized and her identity was no longer secret. In early 1867 she was officially released from the order and she and her companion then went, following a short stay at Corps and La Salette, to live at Castellamare near Naples in Italy, where she was welcomed by the local bishop. She resided there seventeen years, writing down her secret, including the rule for a future religious foundation. Calvat visited the Sanctuary at La Salette for the last time on 18‚Äì19 September 1902. =Death= The house, located in Altamura, where on 14 December 1904 M√©lanie Calvat was found dead. On 14 December 1904 Calvat was found dead in her home in Altamura, Italy. M√©lanie Calvat fled to Altamura, where she never revealed her identity. For the locals, she was just an old French woman who used to go every day to the cathedral for the mass. Her identity was revealed only after her death. Her remains are buried under a marble column with a bas-relief depicting the Virgin Mary welcoming the shepherdess of La Salette into heaven. M√©lanie Calvat's tomb, located in Altamura, Italy Controversy In 1873 M√©lanie Calvat wrote her personal message down again, with the imprimatur of Sisto Riario Sforza, Cardinal Archbishop of Naples. Meanwhile, religious orders were being formed at La Salette, under the auspices of the local bishop, of Grenoble. These were to provide for the pilgrims and spread the message of the vision. M√©lanie Calvat claimed she had been authorized by apparition to provide the names of these orders, their rules and their habits. The one for men was to be entitled Order of the Apostles of the Last Days, the one for the women the Order of the Mother of God. When the bishop refused her demands, she appealed to the Pope and was granted an interview. M√©lanie Calvat was received by Pope Leo XIII in a private audience on 3 December 1878. The message was officially published by M√©lanie Calvat herself on 15 November 1879 and received the imprimatur of Mgr. Salvatore Luigi Zola, bishop of Lecce near Naples (who had protected and assisted Calvat in his diocese) under the title Apparition of the Blessed Virgin on the Mountain of La Salette. (M√©ricourt-l'Abb√© (Somme): Imprimerie Notre-Dame de la Salette, 1930: . Paris: Librairie Sainte-Genevi√®ve, 1905: ) As a consequence of this publication, a historical dispute on the extent of the secret began, which lasts until today. Calvat's anti-Masonic and apocalyptic pronouncements prompted a reaction. In 1880 the bishop of Troyes denounced the Lecce book to the Congregation of the Holy Office, and in turn Prospero Caterini, Cardinal Secretary of the Congregation of the Holy Office, wrote back to him, in August 1880 saying that the Holy Office was displeased with the publication of this book, and wished copies withdrawn from circulation. The letter was passed on to the Bishop of N√Æmes, and later that autumn portions of it were published. It is not clear whether Caterini's letter was personal correspondence or represented an official condemnation.Zimdars-Schwartz, Sandra L., Encountering Mary: From La Salette to Medjugorje, Princeton University Press, 2014 The Vatican later put this book on the Index of Prohibited Books. M√©lanie Calvat moved to Cannes in the south of France, from where she travelled to Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, seeking to found a community with the sponsorship of the Canon de Brandt of Amiens. Eventually she entered into litigation with Bishop Perraud, the ordinary of Autun over an inheritance given to support this foundation. In 1892, M√©lanie Calvat returned to Lecce, Italy, then journeyed to Messina in Sicily at the invitation of Saint Annibale Maria di Francia. Following a few months in the Piedmont region, she was invited by the abb√© Gilbert Combe, pastor of Diou, a priest much taken up with prophecies, to settle in the Allier region. She there finished her autobiography. In 1894 Combe published his version of Melanie's prohibited secret under the title The Great Coup and Its Probable Dates,id:tL93YgEACAAJ, id:xUlqswEACAAJ, id:qzy0mAEACAAJ, which was anti- Bonaparte and pro-Bourbon. It was reprinted at Lyon in 1904, a few months before Calvat's death. It too was put on the Index. =\\"Melanists\\"= Calvat was manipulated by different groups of prophecy enthusiasts, some with political agendas. In 1847 self-proclaimed prophetess Therese Thiriet presented her message as \\"an addition to the prediction of the children of the district of Grenoble\\", largely against the Bishop of Nancy. Melanie early began to blame the cabinet of Napoleon III for the evils she saw about to befall France, and viewed the Franco-Prussian War as a judgment from God. Melanie's \\"prophetic meanderings\\" were later \\"orchestrated by [‚Ä¶] Leon Bloy\\" and it became \\"a 'Melanist' movement allegedly stemming from La Salette, but lacking any foundation except the unverifiable pronouncements of M√©lanie\\". Inspired by both millennialist visionary and the reports of an apparition at La Salette, Bloy was convinced that the Virgin's message was that if people did not reform the endtime was imminent. In 1912 Leon Bloy, an ardent millennialist, published a posthumous autobiography of Calvat, in which Melanie claimed to have had miraculous and prophetic experiences before the apparition of 1846. Jacques Maritain noted that \\"[T]here was a small number of fanatics who made the Secret of La Salette a partisan affair, and whose aberrant interpretations, and their manner of using prophecies like a railway timetable, could only compromise the cause which they claimed to defend. =Legacy= Each apparition is particular to its own milieu and time. Kenneth Woodward has observed that \\"seers acquire charismatic authority, which is routinely challenged by institutional authority in the figure of the local bishop. ... The bishop is duty bound to take the part of the Devil's advocate, to simultaneously question the authenticity of the apparition and explore its possible meaning for the church.\\"Woodward, Kenneth L., \\"Going to See the Virgin Mary\\", New York Times, August 11, 1991 Once again, during the pontificate of Pope Benedict XV, the Church was compelled to address the issue. Benedict XV issued an admonitum or formal papal warning recognizing the many different versions of the secret in all its diverse forms and forbidding the faithful or the clergy to investigate or discuss them without permission from their bishops. The admonitum further affirmed that the Church's prohibition issued under Pope Leo XIII remained binding. A decree in 1923 was prompted by the reprinting of the 1879 edition subsequently altered by an anti-clerical partisan of the secret. Since the Second Vatican Council, the rules regarding the discussion of visions have been relaxed and the Index abolished. Her book was republished, and discussion once again took place. Beatification process On reading an account of her life in 1910, Pope Pius X exclaimed to the Bishop of Altamura, in whose diocese she had died and was buried, \\"La nostra Santa!\\" He suggested to the Bishop that her cause for beatification be introduced immediately. Despite this, Calvat is not currently beatified nor canonized by the Catholic Church. Texts of the revealed secret Both Melanie Calvat's and Maximin Giraud's accounts of the message of the \\"beautiful lady\\" agree. According to the two children's account, the Virgin invited people to respect the repose of Sunday, and the name of God, and cautioned punishment, in particular a scarcity of potatoes, which would rot. She also encouraged them to pray. Their respective \\"secrets\\" appear to differ in both content and tone. Maximin's is somewhat more hopeful. M√©lanie composed various versions of her secret throughout her life. It was noted that the 1879 brochure appeared to be longer than the letter sent to the Pope in 1851. Bishop Zola explained that Melanie had not revealed the entire secret at that time. A lively controversy followed as to whether the secret published in 1879 was identical with that communicated to Pius IX in 1851, or in its second form it was not merely a work of the imagination. The latter was the opinion of wise and prudent persons, who were persuaded that a distinction must be made between the two M√©lanies, between the innocent and simple visionary of 1846 and the visionary of 1879, whose mind had been disturbed by reading apocalyptic books and the lives of illuminati. According to Fr. J. Stern, these later divulgations have nothing to do with the apparition, and Melanie carried to her grave the secret she received that day. *The original version was written down on 6 July 1851, at the behest of the Bishop of Grenoble. *Second version ‚Äì 5, 6, 12 and 14 August 1853: A new version was produced on request of Jacques-Marie-Achille Ginoulhiac, the new bishop of Grenoble, who was unacquainted with the secret. *1858: Calvat wrote to the Pope in 1858. As she was in Darlington at the time, it would have been forwarded through the English College in Rome. No copy has ever been located. *1860-1870-1873: The extended text of 1858 was reproduced in Marseille in 1860 on request of the superiors of M√©lanie Calvat. A copy of the reproduction of 1860 was made in Castellammare in 1870 and was published on 30 April 1873 by F√©licien Bliard, a French priest. This publication contained the approval of the archbishop of Naples, Sisto Cardinal Sforza. *1879: Calvat published a pamphlet about the apparitions. At this point anti-clerical views become apparent, which could have been influenced by her difficulties with the religious authorities. She was not permitted to pronounce religious vows in the diocese of Grenoble. In this version Calvat also states that the Holy Virgin gave her the rule of a new religious order. Her predictions for 1859, 1864, and 1865 were first published in the 1879 version. *Combe version: published 1904. Combe incorporated Calvat's 1879 pamphlet into his own subsequent publication in support of his political views. It was placed on the Index. Again in 1906 another of Combe's publications titled The Secret of Melanie and the Current Crisis was again placed on the Index. These actions of the Church caused some confusion as to whether just Combe's book or the secret itself was placed on the Index. In October 1912, Albert Lepidi O.P., Master of the Sacred Palace, replying to a query by cardinal Louis Lu√ßon, affirmed that the original message of 1846 remained approved. The latter messages, and particularly the 1872‚Äì1873 version, were not.

It is published fortnightly by Motor Presse Netzwerk's subsidiary Motor Presse Stuttgart, a specialist magazine publisher that is 59.9% owned by the publishing house Gruner + Jahr. History Motor und Sport was initially published in 1923 in P√∂√üneck, Germany. It was founded by Fritz Pullig and Felicitas Von Reznicek. Pullig began his career by racing motorcycles in 1912 at the Nurburgring. Pullig was also an aviation pioneer (his first flight was at what is now Hangelarer Airport on July 17th, 1909) and became a flight instructor in 1913. He served as a soldier in WWI and WWII. After the latter, Pullig became an acclaimed author, writing over 30 novels. Notable works include Lockfuhrer Lund (1940), Du bist nicht Sylvia (1939) and Der Held seiner Liebe. In the early 1950s, Pullig was a prototype test driver for Daimler Benz and Opel car prototypes in Frankfurt-Main and tested over 345 prototype cars. In 1963 Pullig died sitting behind the steering wheel of his car in a garage in Mainz Germany. Felicitas Von Reznicek co-authored to Motor und Sport magazine with Fritz Pullig. She authored many novels throughout her career. One of the novels was Hitler‚Äôs Spy Princess, based on Von Reznicek's tale of how she became implicated in a conspiracy to overthrow the German government. The magazine was renamed several times. The first edition, entitled Das Auto, appeared in time for Christmas in 1946 with a cover price of RM 1.50. It was edited and in large part written by F.A.L. Martin contributed his report of automotive developments in the US. A two-page feature highlighted the virtues of the \\"Jeep\\", a word that \\"appeared in no dictionary but nonetheless defined the ideal vehicle for agriculture and forestry\\". Two pages were devoted to the future of nuclear power, incorporating four pictures of nuclear explosions, but concluding that on the grounds of cost, oil-based fuels were likely to continue to power motor vehicles in the immediate future because of the high cost of \\"atomic fuel\\" (Atombetriebsstoff). The second edition appeared in January 1947, and was a double issue covering February 1947; this approach was enforced by paper rationing. By 1950 an expanding circulation had enabled relocation to larger premises in Stuttgart. During the 1960s, demand for circulation increased from approximately 150,000 copies to approximately 400,000. This reflected rapid growth in West German registrations, with 4.5 million cars registered in 1960, rising to 12.5 million in 1969. Readership continued to increase. Sales peaked in 1991 at 523,387 copies.Auflagen der Publikumszeitschriften (IVW) bei pz-online.de Circulation was 406,474 copies for the 2010‚Äì2011 period, making it the ninth best-selling European automobile magazine. Its 2013 circulation was about 370,000 copies. In 1996, a special anniversary issue featured a Berlin subscriber who had retained every copy of Auto Motor und Sport since the age of 17; just over a year after his father's car had been confiscated by a Russian officer, he had first subscribed. The circulation of the magazine was 494,000 copies in the period 2001‚Äì2002. Managing editors Ralph Alex and Jens Katemann took over from Bernd Ostmann in September 2012., Earlier managing editors included Ferdinand Simoneit. Motor Presse Netzwerk issues a yearly publication called Auto Katalog, usually in August. This highly respected publication is an excellent resource and is issued in other languages as well. Its main shortcoming was a nationalist myopia, resulting in a strong focus on German models. Yearly sales figures and an in-depth technical section are included. International versions are published in Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. At one point the English-only language edition was called Complete Car.

Field became a specialist on Asia and was a prime staff member and supporter of the Institute of Pacific Relations. He also supported Henry Wallace's Progressive Party and so many openly Communist organizations that he was accused of being a member of the Communist Party. He was a top target of the American government during the peak of 1950s McCarthyism. Field denied ever having been a party member but admitted in his memoirs, \\"I suppose I was what the Party called a 'member at large.'\\" Early years Field was born on April 13, 1905, a scion of the wealthy Vanderbilt family and a descendant of Corneilus Vanderbilt. A 1923 graduate of the private Hotchkiss School, Field went on to attend Harvard University, where he participated in undergraduate life as chief editor of The Harvard Crimson and a member of the Hasty Pudding Club. Graduating in 1927, Field spent a year at the London School of Economics, where he was exposed to the ideas of Harold Laski, the Fabian socialist political theorist, economist, and writer. First coming into politics as a supporter of the Democratic Party after returning to the United States, he was disillusioned by the Democrats' unwillingness to take a more uncompromising position toward social reform and endorsed Norman Thomas, the Socialist presidential candidate in 1928 and became a member of the Socialist Party. Having attracted significant attention as an unlikely endorsement for Norman Thomas, Field was cut off without a penny by Frederick William Vanderbilt, his great-uncle, from whom he had been promised an estimated fortune of more than $70 million. Institute of Pacific Relations and radical politics Upon Field's return from England in 1928, Edward Clark Carter of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) introduced him to Y.C. James Yen, who was then in the United States to raise money for his Chinese Mass Education Movement. After touring the country as Yen's personal assistant, Field joined the IPR, a group that brought together government and non-governmental elites to study problems of the Pacific rim nations, as an assistant to Carter. Field \\"took no pay; he was, in fact, one of the institute's most generous contributors.\\" He published several reference works on the Asian economy and organized conferences and publications. As he grew older, his politics became more radical. He described the IPR as \\"a bourgeois research-educational organization\\" funded by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations and some of the biggest corporations in the US, which he claimed subsidized his publication of proposals \\"as anticapitalistic as the articles he wrote for The New Masses and The Daily Worker.\\"Ibid.* New Masses was identified by one scholar as the \\"semi-official spokesman of Communist letters\\"James Burkhart Gilbert, Writers and Partisans: A History of Literary Radicalism in America (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992) , p. 106 He was also Executive Vice-President of the Council for Pan American Democracy, which John Dewey's Committee for Cultural Freedom alleged in 1940 was under \\"outright communist control\\"Eugene Lyons, The Red Decade: The Stalinist Penetration of America (Indianapolis: The Bobbs Merill Company, 1941), p. 376 and Provisional secretary of the Board of Directors for the Jefferson School of Social Science, associated with the Communist Party.Guide to the Jefferson School of Social Science He wrote a memo cautioning Owen Lattimore, editor of the IPR quarterly Pacific Affairs, with regard to a certain article that \\"the analysis is a straight Marxist one and... should not be altered.\\"\\"Absent- Minded Professor?\\" Time, March 10, 1952 He donated money and time to Communist causes in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, and during the war, he generously donated money to organizations close to the Soviet Union.Bird and Chervonnaya, Op. cit. In his autobiography, Field confesses that during this period he \\"uncritically accepted\\" Soviet accounts of their political purges and that was \\"taken in.\\" \\"Stalin was infallible,\\" he recalled. \\"[A]ll my Communist surroundings told me so. So was [American Communist Party Secretary Earl] Browder, although on a lower level of sanctity, and so were the other CP [Communist Party] leaders.\\" At a time when other erstwhile loyal friends of the Soviet Union were becoming disillusioned by Stalin's Great Purge, Field defended the Moscow Trials \\"because Comrade Stalin says so, we have to believe the trials are just.\\" Since the IPR aimed to be nonpartisan and, in theory, still attempted to include even the Japanese point of view, he collaborated with his friend Philip Jaffe to set up the journal Amerasia in 1937 as a vehicle for criticism of Japanese attacks in China. Jaffe later pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy to embezzle, steal and purloin\\" government property after Office of Strategic Services and FBI investigators found hundreds of government documents, many labeled \\"secret,\\" \\"top secret,\\" or \\"confidential,\\" in the magazine's offices.Harvey Klehr and Ronald Radosh, The Amerasia Spy Case: Prelude to McCarthyism (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1996) , p. 38‚Äì39, 131.

Civil rights activities Field took an active role in the operation of the Civil Rights Congress, a leftist group of civil rights advocates formed from the merger of the International Labor Defense (ILD), the National Negro Congress, and the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties in Detroit in 1946. The organization concentrated on legal action and political protest, notably publicizing the 1955 lynching of 14-year-old boy Emmett Till and publishing the 1951 document We Charge Genocide. It also helped to pioneer many of the tactics that would be employed by later civil rights workers.Salter, Daren. \\"Civil Rights Congress (1946‚Äì1956)\\". African American History.

Convicted of contempt of court since he would not provide the names of any of his Communist friends, Field served two months of a 90-day sentence in federal prison at Ashland, Kentucky, in 1951. Mexican exile Field at one point moved with his third wife to Mexico in a \\"self-imposed exile\\", but he kept up many of his associations. A 1962 visit by Marilyn Monroe was monitored by the FBI out of concern over the actress's connections to Communism, and a \\"mutual infatuation\\" between her and Field concerned both \\"some in her inner circle, including her therapist\\", according to investigators' files. There was \\"dismay among her entourage and also among the (American Communist Group in Mexico).\\" Those file notations were kept redacted until a FOIA request in 2012. Personal life and death Field married four times. His first wife was a Elizabeth (\\"Betty\\") G. Brown of Duluth, Minnesota, who was a socialist. His second wife, Edith Chamberlain Hunter, supported the Council on African Affairs headed by Max Yergan. His third wife was Anita Cohen Boyer, ex-wife of Raymond Boyer, convicted in a Canadian spy case. His fourth wife was Nieves Orozco, a former model of Diego Rivera.

He is the Board of Trustees Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Fundamental Physics at Northwestern University, and Emeritus George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics at Harvard University. He is primarily known for his experiments trapping and investigating antimatter, measuring the electron g-factor, and measuring the electron electric dipole moment. He has been described as \\"a leader in super-precise measurements of fundamental particles and the study of anti-matter.\\"  Career  Gabrielse attended Trinity Christian College and then Calvin College, graduating with a B.S. (honors) in 1973. He then completed his M.S. (1975) and Ph.D. (1980) in physics from the University of Chicago under Henry Gordon Berry. Gabrielse became a postdoc at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1978 under Hans Dehmelt, and joined the faculty in 1985. He became Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1987, and the chair of the Harvard Physics Department in 2000. In 2018, Gabrielse moved to Northwestern University, becoming the director of the newly created Center for Fundamental Physics at Low Energy. The center will be the first of its kind to be dedicated to small-scale, tabletop fundamental physics experiments.  Research  = Antimatter research = Gabrielse was a pioneer in the field of low energy antiproton and antihydrogen physics by proposing the trapping of antiprotons from a storage ring, cooling them in collisions with trapped electrons, and the use of these to form low energy antihydrogen atoms. He led the TRAP team that realized the first antiproton trapping, the first electron cooling of trapped antiprotons, and the accumulation of antiprotons in a 4 Kelvin apparatus. The demonstrations and methods made possible an effort that grew to involve 4 international collaborations of physicists working at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator. In 1999, Gabrielse's TRAP team made the most precise test of the Standard Model's fundamental CPT theorem by comparing the charge- to-mass ratio of a single trapped antiproton with that of a proton to a precision of 9 parts in 1011. The precision of the resulting confirmation of the Standard Model prediction exceeded that of earlier comparisons by nearly a factor of 106. Gabrielse now leads the ATRAP team at CERN, one of the two teams that first produced slow antihydrogen atoms and suspended them in a magnetic trap. Both TRAP and ATRAP teams used trapped antiprotons within a nested Penning trap device to produce antihydrogen atoms slow enough to be trapped in a magnetic trap. The team made the first one-particle comparison of the magnetic moments of a single proton and a single antiproton. Their comparison, to a precision of 5 parts per million, was 680 times more precision than previous measurements. = Precision measurement = In 2006, Gabrielse's group used a single trapped electron to measure the electron magnetic moment to 0.76 parts per trillion, which was 15 times more precise than a measurement that had stood for about 20 years. Two years later, the team improved the measurement uncertainty by a further factor of 3. In 2014, Gabrielse, as part of the ACME collaboration with John Doyle at Harvard and David DeMille at Yale, measured the electron electric dipole moment to over an order of magnitude over the previous measurement using a beam of thorium monoxide, a result which had implications for the viability of supersymmetry. = Other research contributions = Gabrielse was also one of the discoverers of the Brown-Gabrielse invariance theorem, relating the free space cyclotron frequency to the measureable eigenfrequencies of an imperfect Penning trap. The theorem's applications include precise measurements of magnetic moments and precise mass spectrometry. It also makes sideband mass spectrometry possible, a standard tool of nuclear physics. Gabrielse has also invented a self-shielding superconducting solenoid that uses flux conservation and a carefully chosen geometry of coupled coils to cancel strong field fluctuations due to external sources. The device was responsible for the success of the precise comparison of antiproton and proton, and also enables magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems to locate changing magnetic fields from external sources, such as elevators.  Religious views  Gabrielse identifies himself as a scientist who is Reformed Christian. In an interview, he said: > I do not believe that science and the Bible are in conflict. However, it is > possible to misunderstand the Bible and to misunderstand science. It is > important to figure out what of each might be misunderstood. He has also delivered lectures on the relation between science and religion. In 2006 Gabrielse delivered a lecture titled \\"God of Antimatter\\" in the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, discussing his research into antimatter as well as his personal experience with Christianity. He was awarded the Trotter Prize in 2013 and gave the Trotter Lecture for that year.  Trivia  * On an episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien that aired on February 21, 2007, Jim Carrey and Conan O'Brien humorously discussed content from a paper entitled, \\"Stochastic Phase- Switching of a Parametrically-Driven Electron in a Penning Trap\\" Gerald Gabrielse said that it was 'perhaps the most obscure paper I've ever written'. * Working at CERN, Gabrielse trapped the first antiprotons in 1986. Dan Brown's subsequent novel Angels & Demons, and the movie made from it, use antimatter trapped at CERN as an important plot point.

The Basilian monastery and Greek Catholic church of St. Onuphrius in Lviv, Ukraine is located north of the Old Town, at the base of the Castle Hill. Records mention a wooden church existed at this site already in the 13th century during the reign of Leo I of Halych. During the second half of the 15th century a monastery was built next to the church. A stone church was built in 1550 and in 1585 a monastery surrounded with fortifications. The church was destroyed and rebuilt several times. Damaged by Turks in 1672, it underwent a major reconstruction in 1680. In 1776 the church was connected with the previously separate chapel of the Holy Trinity, adjoining it to the north, a new classicist bell tower was built in 1820 and in the years 1821-1824 the presbytery was extended and a sacristy added. The churches present day look dates to 1902 when the southern nave was constructed symmetrically and both were topped with hexagonal domes. Inside the church holds 18th century polychromies and an iconostasis from 1908.

It is 300 years old. Navarathiri festival is the grandest festival in this temple. More than 1,500,000 devotees celebrate together here.  About  Literally means Kulasekarapandian (Maharaja) + Pattinam (town). The town was named as Kulasekarapattinam while Maharaja Kulasekarapandian ruled the city, one day he had a darshan of the Goddess directly. Henceforth the town has been named after the Maharaja.  Description  In this temple Goddess Muththaramman and Swami Gnanamoorthiswarar vigraham are installed combined together. This is also one of the special features of the temple. Such a combined vigraham is not found elsewhere. In the Garbhagriha, Swami and Goddess shower their blessings to the devotees as Swayambu Murthigal. The temple consists of three Mandapams: Artha Mandapam, Maha Mandapam and Kodi Mandapam. = Artha Mandapam = It is situated next to the Garbhagriha. = Maha Mandapam = Next to the Artha Mandapam, is the Maha mandapam, where Pechiamman, Karuppaswamy and Bairavar are showering their blessings to the devotees. = Kodi mandapam = Next to the Maha Mandapam one can find a 32 feet height Kodimaram which is fully covered with brass. At the bottom of the Kodimaram you can see a square consists of Ambal and Swami, on one side, Astira devar on the other side, Lord Vinayaga on the third side, and on the fourth side Lord Balasubramaniyan statues are molded in brass.  Daily Pooja schedule  Kalai Santhi: 08.00am Uchi Kalam: 12.00pm Sayaratchhai: 5.30pm Rathiri: 8.30pm  Dasara-10 days Navaratri festival  Dasara day is considered a most auspicious day. It is a time-honoured belief that if any new venture is started on this day, it is bound to be successful. Hence, all the undertakings be it laying of foundation of a new building, opening of a new commercial establishment or even initiating a child into the world of learning- are started on this day. In this temple Dasara is being celebrated as a big festival. Lakhs of people are assemble here to celebrate this festival. This temple stands unique amongst the other temples, which celebrates Dasara. The same Dasara itself is celebrated here as a 12-day function instead of nine days (Navaratri).  History behind this Dusshera festival  Once upon a time due to the curse of saint Agathiyar, the saint Varamuni became a man with a buffalo head. The term \\"Magisam\\" means buffalo. Since he had a buffalo head he was called Magisasuran. With his continuous meditation and strenuous effort Magisasuran gained more power and dominated all over the world. To condemn the domination of the Magisasuran the saints approached the Goddess and informed the hardship done by Magisasuran. Then with the power of Goddess there appears a female baby. The baby was named as Lalithambigai. The baby grew up within nine days and on the tenth day she grew as Annai Parasakthi Lalithambigai with much anger came strongly and destroyed Magisasuran and this day (i.e.,) tenth day is being celebrated as Dusshera. The growth occurred by Annai Parasakthi during the nine days are resumed as Navarathiri. The first three days for Malaimagal, the second three days as Alaimagal, and the last three days as Kalaimagal. After the Goddess Annai Parasakthi demolished Magisasuran she was called as Magisasura Marthini. At last the Goddess came to this city and settled and showered her blessing to all the devotees. The devotees whoever wants to observe vridham should do so for 41 days continuously, and during the dusshera (ten days) they should dress like the god/goddess and should not do any mischief, leaving all bad habits, and should be pure at body, mind and soul. One more thing is that whoever wants to dress up like \\"Goddess KALI\\" should be more cautious than others, since people come to them for blessings. People can dress up like any God and Goddess according to their prayers and wishes.  Location  Sri Mutharmman temple is located at Kulasekhara pattinam village near Tiruchendur 55 km south of Tuticorin (Tamil Nadu) on the East coast Road en route to Kanya Kumari. The DASARA celebrations in September/October every year are second to that of Mysore (Karnataka). The uniqueness and oddity of the festival is that the devotees need not spend from their pocket. They are expected to beg alms from door to door and only token offerings expected to be offered at shrine after meeting out their expenses. On the climatic day the sea shores of this otherwise deserted coastal village turns into veritable carnival of folk music and folk dance of the devotees in their chosen fancy dresses to either solicit the grace of or to thank for the boon granted by presiding deity sri Muthramman considered to be the incarnation of Sakthi the consort of Lord Shiva in Hinduism. More than 1.5 million people gather here year after year on the tenth day after new moon day in the month of Purattasi (September/October) according to the Tamil calendar.

(2004). \\"From Ontology chart s to Class diagrams: semantic analysis aiding systems design‚Äù. In: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Porto, 2004. An ontology chart is a type of chart used in semiotics and software engineering to illustrate an ontology.  Overview  The nodes of an ontology chart represent universal affordances and rarely represent particulars. The exception is the root which is a particular agent often labelled ‚Äòsociety‚Äô and located on the extreme left of an ontology chart. The root is often dropped in practice but is implied in every ontology chart. If any other particular is present in an ontology chart it is recognised by the ‚Äò#‚Äô sign prefix and upper case letters. In our ontology chart the node labelled #IBM is a particular organisation. The arcs represent ontological dependency relations directed from left to right. The right affordance is ontologically dependent on the left affordance. The left affordance is the ontological antecedent of the right affordance. A special category of affordances are determiners. They are recognised by the ‚Äò#‚Äô sign prefix. The two examples above are #hourly rate and #name. All determiners have a second antecedent ‚Äì the measurement standard. They are usually dropped from the ontology chart but they are implied and obvious. In the case of hourly rate and name they are currency and language respectively. The names on the arcs are role names of the carrier, the left node, in the relationship node on the right. For example, the ‚Äòemployee‚Äô is the role name of a person while in employment. No ontology chart node has more than two ontological antecedents. Where you find an arc on the ontology chart between a role name and a node, read that as an arc between the right hand side of the role name. So the arc from employee to works at is an arc between employment and works at Mathematically, ontology charts are a graphical representation of semi-lattice structures; specifically they are Hasse diagrams of a single root and no cycles. Ontological dependency is a relationship known mathematically as a partial order set relation (poset). Posets are an object of study in the mathematical discipline of order theory. They belong to the class of binary relations but they have three additional properties: reflexivity, anti- symmetry and transitivity. Ontological dependency is a special poset because it is a binary relation, every thing is ontologically dependent on itself for its existence, two things that are mutually ontologically dependent must be the same thing and if a depends on b and b depends on c then a depends on c. The last of these properties - the transitive property of posets - was exploited by Helmut Hasse to give us the Hasse diagram - a diagram of incredible power, simplicity and if drawn well elegant as well. Because ontology charts have a root that all affordances (realisations/things) are ultimately dependent upon for their existence, they are graphical representation of semi-lattices.

Thirty-two competitors from Hong Kong and Macau formed a team and participated in this competition, but only two Hong Kong competitors scored a victory.Longley, K.: Dave Lacey 'Lai Dai Wai': Buck Sing Choy Lay Fut's unrepentant 'Black Panther' (originally published in Impact International Martial Arts Magazine). Retrieved 7 July 2009. Wong competed in his weight class and had a preliminary match with Wu Ming Jeet (Âê≥ÊòéÂì≤), a Taiwanese fighter known for his powerful kicks, but was knocked out and eliminated. A documentary film covering the competition was played in Hong Kong, with a first-day showing on 12 February 1958. In 1974, Unicorn Chan (Â∞èÈ∫íÈ∫ü) recalled that it was in 1958 when Bruce Lee took him to watch a documentary film on kung fu competitions, and that Lee had watched it seven times before within the last four days.Li, P.

Wan Kam Leung (Ê∫´ÈëëËâØ) witnessed the fight Wong fought with Bruce Lee when Lee returned to Hong Kong from the United States.It took place at Lee's home in Kowloon Tong. Wong claimed that his hands were faster acting than Lee's, however Bruce retaliated by saying his kicks were much faster, thus provoking the friendly scuffle. Wan commented that Lee's kicks were fast and powerful whilst Wong's wing chun hand techniques were modified and practical. Wong and Lee only fought for a short period of time. (25 July 2009). Retrieved 8 May 2010. Po-Wei Chen Wu and Wong's match in the 1957 kung fu competition in Taiwan is the only documented proof of Wong's involvement in fighting competition; the only records of Wong's beimo matches are from eyewitnesses. Since beimo competition was held secretly, the loser often denied involvement in the fight afterward, or both sides would claim victory after the fight. For example, in the match between Ni Yuk Tong (ÂÄ™Ê≤ÉÊ£†) and Wong, various accounts of the fight exist, and no one is sure of where the fight took place, how the fighters performed, and who won. Thus, while many of Wong's students have referred to him as \\"one of the greatest fighters of this century\\" Wong's participation in, and views on, tournaments reflected his philosophy on martial arts. When asked, \\"Did you compete in any organized tournaments with rules?\\" Wong replied, \\"Not in boxing. When I competed, it was in secret. We went into a room, and the door was shut and there were no rules. The government did not allow them. They were illegal, but we didn't care. We fought until the other guy was knocked out.\\"  Enter the Dragon  Some sources claim that Wong choreographed some fight scenes in Enter the Dragon (ÈæçÁà≠ËôéÈ¨•), saying that \\"... when shooting Enter the Dragon in Hong Kong, he [Bruce Lee] invited Wong to come on location to discuss the fight scenes\\" and that \\"Wong in fact had been invited to choreograph some of the fight scenes in Enter the Dragon. The documentary Dragon since 1973 consists of interviews with various Hong Kong personalities, mostly those who worked with Lee in his Golden Harvest days. None of the interviewees, including Bee Chan (Èô≥ÊúÉÊØÖ; one of Lee's most trusted assistants), Shek Kin (Áü≥Â†Ö), and Chaplin Chang (ÂºµÊ¨ΩÈµ¨), mentioned that Wong had been invited to work as a fight scene choreographer for Enter the Dragon.Èæç‰∏Ä‰πù‰∏É‰∏â‰ª•Âæå (Dragon since 1973).

He was scheduled to attend a screen test on the set of Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, \\"About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him.\\"Wong, S. L.: Wong Shun Leung on Bruce Lee Retrieved on 7 July 2009.

She was the first commoner in modern history to marry into the royal family of Lesotho. Since becoming Queen, she has become the Patron of several charities and has worked to promote the work of projects related to HIV/AIDS. Early life Queen 'Masenate Mohato Seeiso was born Anna Karabo Mot≈°oeneng in Mapoteng in the Berea District, the eldest daughter of the five children of Thekiso Mot≈°oeneng and his wife 'Makarabo. She was christened Anna in the Roman Catholic Church.

Her Majesty is a French language learner at the Alliance Fran√ßaise.  Relationship with Letsie III of Lesotho Queen 'Masenate first met King Letsie III of Lesotho in 1996. This was the same year he became King for the second time, following the death of his father in a road accident. =Engagement and marriage= In October 1999, two years into her studies at the National University of Lesotho, she became engaged to King Letsie III. They were married on February 18, 2000 in Maseru. He was the only unmarried King in Africa. The ceremony was conducted in the Setsoto Stadium by Archbishop Bernard Mohlalisi, with 40,000 people present including dignitaries such as Nelson Mandela, Festus Mogae, Bakili Muluzi and Prince Charles of the British Royal Family. This marked the first time in the history of modern Lesotho where a royal had married a commoner. She credited the Royal Family for making her welcome, in particular the influence of Queen 'Mamohato, the Queen Mother. 'Masenate and 'Mamohato grew close and the Queen found it difficult when Mamohato died in 2003, but praised her husband for supporting her at the time. In an interview with the Lesotho Times in 2014, she said \\"I like the fact that he listens when I advise him on various issues that are personal. For instance, I want him to be well-dressed for various functions. And, as the woman of the house, I also recommend a lot of things, food, music, movies and more educative television channels for all of us. His Majesty is a very reserved, respectful, patient, wise and humble person and he is all that in a very sweet way. These are the qualities he has sustained over the years. They have drawn me much closer to him. I love him dearly every day.\\" =Motherhood and children= Queen 'Masenate and King Letsie have three children; Princess Senate (b. 7 October 2001), Princess 'Maseeiso (b. 20 November 2004), and Prince Lerotholi (b. 18 April 2007). She later explained that she wished she had more children, saying \\"Maybe I should have had one early after Prince Lerotholi but now my biological clock is telling me the time is up. I have read a lot about reproductive health-related risks and some medical researchers, in their studies, don't recommend women to consider falling pregnant at my age.

He is also the founder and director of the Center for Global Politics at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, which offers four distinct graduate study programs designed for professionals and young leaders. His research interests include theories of International Relations, transformations in the former Soviet Union, international political economy, and globalization.  Biography  From 1974-1979, Segbers studied history, Slavic languages, political science, and philosophy at Ruhr University Bochum and University of Konstanz, completing his studies with both a master's degree and Staatsexamen (government-recognized exam for future teachers). In 1984, he obtained his PhD (Dr. phil.) from Bremen University with a study on the USSR during the Second World War. Segbers worked as research fellow at a project on Soviet reform politics at the University of Bremen and later as research fellow at JWG University in Frankfurt am Main. From 1990-1995, he joined Germany¬¥s leading think tank on politics, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) at Ebenhausen and in 1992 qualified as professor with a book on systemic change in the Soviet Union. After working as professor for International Relations at the University of Konstanz in 1995, Segbers became professor for Political Science and East European Politics at the Institute for East European Studies and the Otto-Suhr-Institut at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. He has conducted several research projects ‚Äì among others one on Post-Soviet Puzzles (on spaces, territories, elites and interests in the FSU; published 1994/95) and one on Explaining Post-Soviet Patchworks (1998‚Äì2000) ‚Äì and has implemented as well as supervised different study projects which since 2007 are integrated in the Center for Global Politics. Segbers is a member of several scientific boards of organizations of international repute including the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) the Gulf Research Center, and the Institute for European Politics. As visiting scholar he has worked, amongst others, at Stanford University, George Washington University, Harvard University, Columbia University and Fudan University. He is also a member of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University.  Fields of activity  As both Chair for Political Science at the Institute for East European Studies at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and Professor for International Relations, Segbers‚Äô research interests cover a broad range of topics. He directed research projects on the political and societal transformations in East Europe and in the Former Soviet Union (‚ÄúPost- Soviet Puzzles‚Äù; ‚ÄúExplaining Post Soviet Patchworks‚Äù) and headed a research project ‚ÄúGlobal City Regions‚Äù (2002‚Äì2004) exploring the role of city regions as sub-state political entities within the context of contemporary globalization processes. According to Segbers, globalization and global flows of capital, trades and services, information and people are dramatically altering the nature of politics and the opportunities for nation-states to control or influence events. ‚ÄúPolitics can no more be masterminded, engineered, implemented, executed, organized and controlled. Politics, rather, is happening, as the result of thousands of moves by a multitude of actors on different levels of action.‚Äù Segbers suggests that politicians should reduce expectations and not try to function as engineers but as moderators, or as navigators. Another proposal is to shift decision-making processes from the nation-state to the local and suprantional level. Presently, Segbers is engaged in advancing blended learning study courses as well as in fostering international academic cooperation. He is founder and director of the Center for Global Politics which unites four graduate study programs: the M.A. programs East European Studies Online (EES Online) and International Relations Online (IR Online), the Global Politics Seasonal Schools, and German Studies Russia, in cooperation with the Moscow Institute for International Relations, Moscow.

Life and legacy Gim Myeong-guk was born in 1600. He entered the royal service as a member of the Dohwaseo, the official painters of the Joseon court. Quite immediately, Gim Myeong-guk appeared as a new type of artist, clearly distinctive from his contemporaries, who more or less worked as craftsmen that faithfully replicated mainstream styles. A diplomatic statement is \\"he was known to have an artistic personality that was characterized by individualism and obstinacy\\", while an understatement would be \\"his contemporaries described him as a carefree drunkard, a characterization that corresponds to the Chinese image of the eccentric artist\\". Nevertheless, (or precisely for this reason), Gim Myeong-guk has been in charge of many official artistic tasks. He was member of both the large-scale Tongsinsa send to Japan by King Injo (1595‚Äì1623‚Äì1649). The 1636 delegation was led by Im Gwang (1579‚Äì1644), while the 1643 delegation was led by Yun Sunji (1591‚Äì1666). \\"According to one account, Gim became distraught with exhaustion because an endless stream of Japanese enthusiasts, eager to purchase his works, would not allow him a moment of peace\\"..

Most of the Gim Myeong-guk paintings involving people have Buddhist themes (and a specific artistic style). His pen name Yeondam (\\"Lotus pond\\") has Buddhist connotations.

Life He was born in London, the son of Henry Field, and educated at Christ's Hospital and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship in 1824. He was ordained in 1828, and began a close study of patristic theology. Eventually he published an emended and annotated text of Chrysostom's Homiliae in Matthaeum (Cambridge, 1839), and some years later he contributed to Edward Pusey's Bibliotheca Patrum (Oxford, 1838‚Äì1870), a similarly treated text of Chrysostom's homilies on Paul's epistles. In 1839 he had accepted the living of Great Saxham, in Suffolk, and in 1842 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Reepham in Norfolk. He resigned in 1863, and settled at Norwich, in order to devote his whole time to study. Twelve years later he completed the Origenis Hexaplorum quae supersunt (Oxford, 1867‚Äì1875), now well known as Field's Hexapla, a text reconstructed from the extant fragments of Origen's work of that name, together with materials drawn from the Syro-hexaplar version and the Septuagint of Robert Holmes and James Parsons (Oxford, 1798‚Äì1827). Field was appointed a member of the Old Testament revision company in 1870. In 1881, when the Revision of the New Testament was printed, Field published Notes on select passages of the Greek Testament : chiefly with reference to recent English versions, in which he criticized many of the changes in the New Testament revision (the Old Testament was not published till 1885).

Analysis The opening chords present all the pitch materials of the piece. They are of two kinds: (1) \\"resonant\\" chords made by superposing two major, minor, augmented, diminished triads (sometimes with an added seventh or ninth), to form basically \\"harmonic\\" structures, and (2) \\"anti-resonant\\" or \\"noisy\\" chords based on chromatic relationships and containing a large number of seconds and fourths, giving them a more \\"inharmonic\\" character . These chords are progressively horizontalised, creating \\"a syntactic flux between structurally opposite and intermediate constituents\\" . The resulting opposition between chords and fast, single-voice chromatic figures resembles the compositional alternation of clusters and melodic gestures in Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºck X . The treatment of tempos also serves to govern the overall form. There are three types of tempo usage : # a single tempo is used for a long span of music, providing a sense of stability, stasis, or even tension # different independent tempos governing short gestures are juxtaposed within a single section # the tempo is made to accelerate or decelerate to underline the particular gestures The chordal opening soon dissolves into the turbulent \\"centre\\" of the piece, featuring tremolos and bursts of notes within a narrow registral span. There are also single notes and small clusters covering the piano's entire range. Concealed beneath this active surface of this section are repetitions and extensions of the chords from the beginning of the piece constituting a long repeated pitch sequence (containing internal recurring sequences). These relationships become more evident as the turbulence subsides toward the end of the section, finally coalescing into a conclusion of staccato chords similar to those at the outset of the Sequenza .

The Reynst Collection, probably the most extensive Dutch 17th century collection of art and artefacts, was owned by the Dutch merchants Gerrit Reynst (also known as Gerard Reynst) and Jan Reynst. The collection was put on display in their house at the sign of Hope on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam. It consisted of over 200 Italian paintings and over 300 sculptures, most of them ancient Roman. There were other antiquities: ten sepulchral monuments, five votive reliefs, nine cinerary urns, \\"Etruscan\\" vases, and Christian objects, as well as engraved gems. The collection was dispersed in the 1660s and 1670s, after both brothers had died, and Gerrit's widow sold parts to various buyers.Anne-Marie S.

Bastet in Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art 11. 1 (1980:55-57). History of the Collection In 1625 Jan Reynst became the representative of the family in Venice and was known there as Giovanni Reynst. He was impressed by the collections of wealthy Venetians and intended to build one of his own. Because Venice was in decline after trade around the Cape of Good Hope destroyed their monopoly, many merchants there sold their art collections. Jan Reynst, rather than patiently collecting for years, bought the collection of Andrea Vendramin (1556-1629) from Vendramin's widow. Vendramin had meticulously catalogued his collection in 1627. The items bought from Vendramin's widow, some 230 antiquities, about 140 paintings and curiosities of natural history‚Äî a true cabinet of curiosity‚Äî were shipped to Amsterdam and would remain the core of the Reynst Collection, though Jan Reynst continued to buy art in Venice. Put on display in the family house in Amsterdam, the collection stayed largely together for several decades. A visitors list was kept, which includes famous people such as writer Joost van den Vondel and poet Constantijn Huygens. A statue, supposedly of Cleopatra, was donated to Princess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels after she had shown interest in it when visiting the collection; it was delivered the day before she received a visit from Marie de' Medici, whom it was doubtless intended to impress.Bastet reviewing Logan 1980. After both the Reynst brothers had died the collection dispersed. In 1660 the first sale took place, when the best pieces (24 paintings and 12 sculptures) were bought by the Dutch Republic for the large amount of 80,000 guilders. This part of the collection would become the Dutch Gift, which mostly remains in the English Royal Collection, who have 14 of the paintings, with other works now in museums. Three of the antique sculptures escaped the Whitehall fire (1691) because they were installed in the garden behind the Banqueting House. Other parts of the collection ended up in Germany and with other Dutch collectors. Some antiquities found their way to the Papenbroek Collection, and through there to the collection of the Dutch National Museum of Antiquities. Around 1665 to 1670, after the collection was dispersed, engravings of some of the best pieces were finally published, the project having been initiated in 1655.

The Police and Border Guard BoardPolice and Border Guard Board http://www.politsei.ee/en/ () is responsible for processing applications and enquiries concerning Estonian citizenship. Resolution Concerning the Citizenship of the Democratic Republic of Estonia, the first Estonian citizenship law was adopted by the Estonian National Council on 26 November 1918. According to this law, all people who *1) were permanent residents on the day the law came into force on the territory of the Republic of Estonia; *2) prior to the Estonian Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918 had been subjects of the Russian State; *3) were entered in the parish registers or originated from the territory of Estonia, regardless of their ethnicity and faith were proclaimed Estonian citizens. The Citizenship Law adopted in 1922 defined the principles of succession by applying the jus sanguinis principle. Eligibility for Estonian citizenship =By descent= Children born to parents, at least one of whom was an Estonian citizen at the time of birth (regardless of the place of birth) are automatically considered Estonian citizens by descent. =By place of birth= Children born in Estonia are eligible for Estonian citizenship if at least one parent holds Estonian citizenship at the time of birth. =By marriage= A person who married an Estonian citizen before 26 February 1992 is eligible for Estonian citizenship. =By naturalisation= Those seeking to become Estonian citizens via naturalisation are required to fulfill the following criteria: * applicant is aged 15 or over * resided in Estonia legally for at least eight years and, of that, have spent the last five years with permanent residence in Estonia * be familiar with the Estonian language. People who have graduated from an Estonian-speaking high school or an institute of higher education are assumed to fulfill this criterion without the need to take a full examination. * take an examination demonstrating familiarity with the Estonian Constitution * showing a demonstrated means of support * taking an oath of loyalty Those who have committed serious crimes or are foreign military personnel on active duty are ineligible to seek naturalisation as an Estonian citizen. Duties and rights of Estonian citizenship * Male Estonian citizens are required to take up national service. Undefined citizenship 'Undefined citizenship' (, ) is a term used in Estonia to denote a post-Soviet form of statelessness. It is applied to those migrants from former Soviet republics and their children, who were unable or unwilling to pursue any country's citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia being a successor state to the Soviet Union, all former USSR citizens qualified for citizenship of Russian Federation, available upon mere request, as provided by the law \\"On the RSFSR Citizenship\\" in force up to end of 2000.The Policy of Immigration and Naturalization in Russia: Present State and Prospects , by Sergei Gradirovsky et al. Estonia's policy of requiring naturalisation of post-war immigrants was in part influenced by Russia's citizenship law and the desire to prevent dual citizenship,Wayne C. Thompson, Citizenship and borders: Legacies of Soviet empire in Estonia, Journal of Baltic Studies, Volume 29, Issue 2 Summer 1998 , pages 109 ‚Äì 134 and upon the established legal principle that persons who settle under the rule of an occupying power gain no automatic right to nationality. According to Peter Van Elsuwege, a scholar in European law at Ghent University, a number of historic precedents support this, most notably the case of Alsace-Lorraine when France on recovering the territory in 1918 did not automatically grant French citizenship to German settlers despite Germany having annexed the territory 47 years earlier in 1871.Peter Van Elsuwege, From Soviet republics to EU member states: a legal and political assessment of the Baltic states' accession to the EU, BRILL, 2008, p75 Persons of undefined citizenship who reside legally in Estonia can apply for an Estonian alien's passport.

According to law, acquiring a foreign citizenship voluntarily and entering into a military or civilian service for another state constitute forfeiture of Estonian citizenship. In effect, this forfeiture requirement applies to naturalised Estonian citizens only, because, according to the constitution, Estonian citizenship obtained by descent is inalienable and cannot be taken away by anyone else other than the citizenship holder.The Constitution of the Republic of Estonia Citizenship of the European Union Because Estonia forms part of the European Union, Estonian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Estonian embassy, Estonian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

Travel freedom of Estonian citizens Visa requirements for Estonian citizens Visa requirements for Estonian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Estonia. As of 7 July 2020, Estonian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 179 countries and territories, ranking the Estonian passport 13th in the world according to the Henley Passport Index. Holders of Estonian alien's passport face different visa requirements. In 2017, the Estonian nationality is ranked twenty-first in the Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

This translation of the Holy Scriptures in Tagalog follows the tradition of the Good News Bible, an English language translation published by the American Bible Society in 1966. However, the Magandang Balita Biblia is not a translation of the Good News Bible but only a parallel translation of it. Also, like the tradition of the Good News Bible, some publications features line drawings of Biblical events with a snippet of text. Also, unlike other Tagalog translations, the Magandang Balita Biblia also tried to translate the verse parts of the Bible in verse form, making it more singable when set to music. Popularity As there are but a very few translations of the Holy Scriptures in Tagalog, the 'Magandang Balita Biblia' has easily become a very popular version in the Philippines and the Filipino diaspora. Its version of the Psalms was used as the official text of the Catholic Liturgy of the Hours in Tagalog. It is also widely used by those of other denominations in church services and Bible Studies. Sources and bases According to the Philippine Bible Society, the translators used the Masoretic Texts as the main basis of their Old Testament. However, when there was no satisfactory text that could be used as a basis, the PBS opted to use any of the oldest versions available. These versions are those written in Greek, Syriac or Latin. However, when there still was no other version available, the committee opted to use a modern translation that they deemed suitable. For the Deuterocanonical Books, the translator used the Septuagint as the sole basis. Particularly, they used the one that was published in 1949, which was edited by Alfred Rahlfs. However, for comparative purposes, the PBS used the Biblia Sacra (published 1969) which was prepared by Robert Weber. When it comes to the New Testament, the Translators used the Greek New Testament (published 1975), same for some parts that was based on a variant reading supported by one or more Greek manuscript. Features and translation method The Magandang Balita Biblia is the first Tagalog Bible to use the dynamic equivalence technique. Its aim was to give more emphasis to meaning than to form. Unlike the earlier Ang Biblia, this translation of the Bible used weights and measures that were more familiar to Filipino readers. Since there was a trend towards Filipinisation during the Marcos Era (the time when the Biblia was published), it was just expected that there was a tension regarding the use of borrowed words. This was, however, changed in the 2005 Edition of the Biblia when the translators chose words like \\"bag\\" instead of the more traditional \\"sisidl√°n\\" (\\"[small] container\\"). The translators used the more ecumenical \\"Yahweh\\" for the tetragrammaton YHWH. This is because Filipinos associated the name \\"Jehovah\\" with Protestant leanings (specifically because of the Bible published by Jehovah's Witnesses). Another reason for doing this is to eliminate the confusion on instances where the term \\"YHWH Elohim\\" is used; this is translated as \\"Panginoong Yahweh\\". As is the practice in all the Bible translations in the Philippine languages, place names and personal names followed their Spanish counterparts. The new revision as of 2005, changed some proper names such as Nabucadnosor and Esdras to the semi- anglicised and more recognisable Nebucadnezar and Ezra, respectively. Likewise, the new revision has its footnotes added and had also interspersed the deuterocanonical books in its Catholic versions. The target of the new revision of 2005 is to modernize the usage of the vocabulary, replacing the classical Tagalog words. Likewise, some words found in the 1980 edition, such as patutot (prostitute), pakakak (trumpet), saserdote (priest), and lebadura (yeast) were considered archaic and 'deep' (with some of Spanish origin) and changed to the more contemporary babaeng nagbebenta ng aliw (\\"woman selling amusement\\", a euphemism), trumpeta, pari (originally used for Christian priests), and pampaalsa (\\"that which causes rising\\").  Liturgical usage  Being an ecumenical translation, the liturgical usage of the first edition was upheld by the Catholic Church in the Philippines. This is also the recognised text of most denominations that use Tagalog in the Liturgy, such as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and the Episcopal Church in the Philippines.

The GDx-VCC is one example. However a Dutch study found that while there is a correlation between standard automated perimetry and GDx VCC measurements in patients with glaucoma, suggesting that GDx VCC measurements relate well with functional loss in glaucoma, in healthy subjects, they found virtually no correlation between perimetry and GDx VCC measurements. This would cast doubt on its predictive value and suggests false positives. see : \\"The Relationship between Standard Automated Perimetry and GDx VCC Measurements\\", Nicolaas J. Reus and Hans G. Lemij.... From the Glaucoma Service, The Rotterdam Eye Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. For overview, this first prototype of this instrument was developed about 10 years ago, and was first released commercially as the GDx Nerve fiber analyzer (Laser Diagnostic Technologies Inc). The second generation product is called the GDx Access. The field of view is 15 degree and imaging should be performed through an undilated pupil. The polarised laser scans the fundus, building a monochromatic image. The state of polarisation of the light is changed (retardation) as it passes through birefringent tissue (cornea and RNFL). Corneal birefringence is eliminated (in part) by a proprietary 'corneal compensator'. The amount of retardation of light reflected from the fundus is converted to RFNL thickness. Sub-optimal compensation of corneal birefringence is currently being addressed by the manufacturer with hardware and software modifications. The GDx scanning laser measures the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, which is the very first part of your eye that is damaged by glaucoma. Before we go any further, let us describe the basic GDx instrument. This instrument use a GaAIAs diode laser as a source of light. This diode will emit polarized light. The source is HeNe (632.8 nm) and argon (514 nm). A polarization modulator in this instrument changes the polarization states of the laser output. The linearly polarized beam from the laser then passes through a rotating quarter- wave retarder. A scanning unit in this instrument is used to move the beam horizontally and vertically on the retina. The focused beam is 35Œºm in diameter. This instrument also has a polarization detector. It is used to detect polarized light that is reflected back from the cornea. It is also used to analyze the change in the polarization of the reflected radiation. This element consists of a second synchronously rotating quarter-wave retarder and a linear polarizer in front of the photo-detector. The output is then sampled, digitized, and stored by a computer. Concept of the instrument The GDx nerve fiber analyzers measure the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness with a scanning laser polarimeter based on the birefringent properties of the RNFL. Measurement is obtained from a band 1.75 disc diameters concentric to the disc. It projects a polarized beam of a light into the eye. As this light passes through the NFL tissue, it changes and slow. The detectors measure the change and convert it into thickness units that are graphically displayed. The GDx measure modulation around an ellipse just outside the optics disc and ratios of the thickest points either superiorly or inferiorly to the temporal or nasal regions. The field of view is 15 degree and imaging should be performed through undilated pupil. The polarized laser scans the fundus and building a monochromatic image. The state of polarization of the light is change (retardation) as it passes thropugh birefringent tissue (cornea and RNFL). Corneal birefringent is eliminated (in part) by a propriety ‚Äòcorneal compensator‚Äô. The amount of retardation of light reflected from the fundus is converted to RNFL thickness. In Retinal scanning laser polarimetry (SLP), the cornea, lens, and retina are all treated as linear retarders (optical elements that introduce retardation to an illuminating beam). A linear retarder has a slow axis and a fast axis, and the two axes are orthogonal to each other. Polarized light travels at higher speed when its electric field vector is aligned with the fast axis of a retarder. In contrast, polarized light travels at lower speed when its electric field vector is aligned with the slow axis of a retarder. Optical System In the model, the measuring beam passed through three linear retarders: the corneal compensator (CC), the cornea (C), and a uniform radial retarder (R), that represented birefringent regions in the retina (e.g., peripapillary RNFL or macula). And polarization-preserving reflector (PPR). Retarders Firstly, the retardation (i.e., the change in polarization) is proportional to the RNFL thickness. In this instrument, there are four retarders in the measurement beam‚Äôs path: 1\\\\. The first two linear retarders have equal retardance and form a VCC. 2\\\\. The third linear retarder is the combination of cornea and lens‚Äîthe anterior segment 3\\\\. The fourth linear retarder, with radially distributed axes, is the retinal birefringent structure (RE; either peripapillary RNFL or the Henle fiber. As polarized light passes through a form-birefringent medium, one of the two component waves traveling at 90 to each other becomes retarded relative to the other. The degree of the resulting phase shift is directly proportional to the number of microtubules the light passes through, which in turn, is directly proportional to RNFL thickness. The figure above illustrates this process. The RNFL isn't the only form-birefringent structure in the eye. Anterior segment structures, such as the cornea, also phase-shift polarized light. So the latest instrument includes a compensating device or compensating corneal which is designed to remove the portion of the signal generated by the anterior segment. This device consists of two optical retarders, which when rotated relative to each other, allow the operator to set the compensator to any value between 0 nm and 120 nm. Rotating the device to any axis can compensate for anterior segment birefringence in any orientation up to 120 nm in magnitude. The slow axis of R was oriented radially, and distance around R was measured from the horizontal nasal meridian by angle Œ≤. At each point, therefore, the fast axis of R was R = Œ≤ + 90¬∞. Radial variation in retardance was not analyzed. The measuring beam was reflected at a deeper layer and traveled back through the three retarders to the ellipsometer. Reflection from the ocular fundus exhibits a high degree of polarization preservation, and the reflector in the model (polarization-preserving reflector [PPR]) was assumed to preserve completely the polarization state of the incident beam, except for a 180¬∞ phase change due to the reversal in direction. Each optical component in the model experienced a double pass of the measuring beam. What is birefringent? Birefringent is relared or characterized as a double refraction. In this picture we can see calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction. Instrument Components: 1.the SLP, 2.the VCC, consist of two identical retarders, 3\\\\. the anterior segment of the eye (A), 4\\\\. The retinal birefringent structures (RE), either the RNFL or the Henle fiber layer, and the fundus as PPR. Clinical interpretation Clinical Interpretation based on results from GDx Nerve Fiber Analyzer from Carl Zeiss Meditec. Firstly, this instrument is used to measure thickness of nerve fiber layer in our retina. But, GDx give monochromatic image. Then this system will analyze and give colors for certain various thicknesses. Presents RNFL thickness in colour with thick regions in red and yellow and thin regions in blue and green. For healthy eye, the image will show yellow and red colour in superior and inferior at NFL regions. But, in glaucoma, the image is absence of red and yellow colours. Superiorly and inferiorly more uniform blue appearance. Picture indicates that the eye is at the advance stage of the disease. Deviation map The deviation map reveals the location and magnitude of RNFL thinning relative to a normal value. This normal value was generated as an average of people from various cultures. Defects are colour- coded based on probability of normality (e.g. yellow means that the probability is below 5% of that RNFL at that location is normal). A healthy eye has a clear deviation map. A further representation is the TSNIT graph. TSNIT is stand for Temporal ‚Äì Superior ‚Äì Nasal ‚Äì Inferior-Temporal. This graph displays the thickness values along the Calculation Circle from T to S, N and back to T. The area of normal values is shaded. Measurements for the left eye are labeled \\"OS\\", those for the right eye \\"OD\\". A defect is indicated if a measured value falls below the shaded area. GDx Comparative database A comprehensive database is essential for accurate glaucoma detection. In this instrument a database from 540 normal eyes is used. The subjects are multi- ethnic and 18‚Äì82 years old. The database also contains 262 glaucomatous eyes used by the NFI to discriminate between normal and glaucoma.

Zub is in the employ of Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire who has been tasked with retrieving the Green Eye of Zub. In order to facilitate this task, Zub has been permitted use of the ancient intergalactic elevator system which permits transport between planets. The elevators do not follow any sort of linear route and must be reached by traversing and riding platforms on planets to reach any of the three elevators at the top of the chain. The platforms and elevators are guarded by creatures confusingly known as Zubs but each planet has a different sub-species - for example the first level's Zub resembles a gyroscope whilst he fourth level's is a fish. The Zubs can be shot and stunned. They will float to the top platform level and then descend to harass and attack Zub. The Green Eye of Zub was last located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found, Zub has to return to the first planet to present the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub.

Zdzis≈Çaw Peszkowski () ( - ), of the Jastrzƒôbiec coat of arms was a Polish Roman Catholic priest and one of a small group of Polish army officers who managed to survive the 1940 mass execution of over 20,000 Polish citizens by NKVD, the Katyn massacre. Peszkowski was a leading advocate and chaplain for the Katyn Families Association, which works with survivors of the Katyn massacre and their families. Early life Zdzis≈Çaw Peszkowski was born in 1918 in Sanok (; Syanik; ), in Galicia before the dissolution of Austro- Hungarian Empire. After World War I, the town was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic. After completing high school in 1938 he was drafted into the Polish Cavalry.  Military  Peszkowski was a Sergeant, leading a platoon of the 20th Uhlan Regiment of King Jan III Sobieski (), during the Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, almost the whole regiment was captured by the Red Army. Prisoners were interned initially in Pomorzany. There, the painter Wlastimil Hofman portrayed the prisoners in small portraits. These portraits, including one of Zdzis≈Çaw Peszkowski, were to be sent to the prisoners' families. In October 1939, Peszkowski was transported from Poland into the Soviet Union to a POW camp, established in the Optina Monastery in Kozelsk () for Polish prisoners taken captive by the Red Army. In May 1940, he was transported from Kozelsk to a camp called Pavlishchev Bor, and then to Gryazovets (; ). In 1941, following Operation Barbarossa and the Sikorski-Maisky agreement he was released during the Amnesty for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union and joined the Polish Armed Forces in the East being formed in Buzuluk (). He was promoted to Rotmistrz and lead a company in the 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment (). In the spring of 1942 the organizing formation was moved to the area of Tashkent (), Uzbekistan. In the second part of 1942, the formation was transferred through the Persian Corridor to the British Middle East Command as a military occupation force after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.  Priesthood  Peszkowski left the army following World War II and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. He became a leading advocate for the remembrance of the Katyn massacre and the murder of Poles elsewhere in the country during the war. He also became a chaplain for Polish families of the Katyn massacres. He preached forgiveness for the perpetrators of Katyn. He called for forgiveness for those who killed Polish army officers during a speech at Warsaw's Unknown Soldiers' Grave in 1995.

Reuvens Caspar Jacob Christiaan Reuvens (22 January 1793 ‚Äì 26 July 1835) was a Dutch historian and archaeologist. He was the founding director of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (Dutch National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden, the world's first ever professor of archaeology (at Leiden University),Willems W. J.

Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 95. and conducted the first excavations at the Roman provincial site Forum Hadriani in the Netherlands. Personal life and education In 1798, when Reuvens was only five years old, he lost his mother. His father was a prominent jurist, had been Minister of Justice for a short while, and filled various other important offices. Reuvens' father was transferred to Paris after the annexation of the Netherlands by France under Napoleon in 1810, so the young Reuvens lived there for some years. In 1813 Reuvens graduated from the University of Paris with a degree in law. During the reign of Napoleon, Paris received art from all the conquered nations and Reuvens studied with the famous antiquarian Vivant Denon, the director of the Louvre Museum. It has been argued that this experience in Paris would prove an inspiration for Reuvens' later efforts to establish a Dutch national museum for archaeology.Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 18181840, Routledge, p. 23. In 1814 Reuvens and his father returned to the Netherlands where they both found work as lawyers. Reuvens continued his childhood and teenage interest in the ancient world by studying and writing commentaries on Greek and Latin literature. These were published in 1815 under the title Collectanea litteraria. In 1816 Reuvens became a professor in Harderwijk, and in 1818 at Leiden University (see below). Around this time Reuvens' father was killed in Brussels as a key witness in some sort of scandal. The details of the murder case remain unsolved. In 1822 Reuvens got married, and three children would follow within the decade. Reuvens died in 1835, aged only 42, of what seems to have been a stroke.Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 18181840, Routledge, p. 1423. He is buried in Leiden. Professorships The newly established first king of the Netherlands, William I, attempted to restart the University of Harderwijk in 1815. Caspar Reuvens was appointed professor of Greek and Latin there, and began his teaching in 1816. In 1816 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute and six years later became a member. In 1818 the Ministry of Education aborted the unsuccessful attempt to start a school at Harderwijk. There were only six professors, of which Reuvens was one. His area of expertise, Latin and Greek, did not have any vacancies at other universities though. At this point the Minister of Education wrote a letter to King William I suggesting a professorship of archaeology for Reuvens, as the young man showed a keen interest in antiquities. The king signed the royal decree on 13 June 1818, making Reuvens the world's first archaeology professor. Rijksmuseum van Oudheden With Reuvens' appointment came the directorship of the archaeological cabinet of Leiden University. This collection of antiquities consisted of the inheritance of the Papenbroek Collection which came into the university's possession in 1743. Immediately upon starting his teachings in Leiden, Reuvens boldly requested a new building for the collection, the creation of an archaeological library and had several other demands for the trustees. Apart from a few elementary needs for his teachings, most of the requests were ignored and did not receive any response. When in 1819 Reuvens directly approached the minister of education for funding, he discovered that this straight line to the government was a much more fruitful way of gaining funds than through the trustees. The Ministry of Education paid for casts of the Elgin Marbles and their transportation to the Netherlands, without having the university involved. Reuvens quickly added several other university collections of antiquities to the Papenbroek Collection, and thereby extended the variety to include Egyptian artefacts. With government support he began gathering various collections from outside Leiden as well, and occasionally he received personal gifts for the archaeological cabinet. Some organizations did not mind parting with their antiquities, since they were often an alien group of objects among larger collections of for example biological or geological specimens. Other organizations fought academic and political battles with Reuvens.Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 18181840, Routledge, p. 3443. (Also see Rijksmuseum van Oudheden). With the help of the Department of Education, Arts and Sciences, Reuvens added other collections to the museum during the 1820s. This includes the three Rottiers Collections. Reuvens would later discover that Colonel Rottiers would not hesitate to sell forgeries, and the two had a fall out. During the same period a long friendship with Major Jean Emile Humbert began, and the two worked together on the research and publication of ancient Carthage. This co-operation would prove to be of major importance to the collection of the museum and the careers of both Reuvens and Humbert. Humbert went on two archaeological expeditions, one to Carthage and one to Italy, as an agent for the Dutch government. Sending his reports and catalogs of collections on sale directly to Reuvens, the co-operation of the two men would bring important additions to the National Museum. In 1830 Reuvens published parts of a papyrus in the Leiden collection, and for that is credited with beginning the scholarly study of papyri.Betz, H. D. (1996). The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, University of Chicago Press, p. xliii. On his way back from England in 1835 Reuvens became severely ill and probably suffered a stroke. He died young, leaving the National Museum of Antiquities with a considerable collection as his legacy. The Forum Hadriani excavation Reuvens would lead the first professional excavation in the Netherlands. Located in the modern town of Voorburg (just outside of The Hague), excavations of the Forum Hadriani began in 1827 and would last through 1833. The whole project was hampered by bad weather and budgetary problems, but Reuvens demonstrated meticulous recording methods and invented techniques for field archaeology along the way. Reuvens moved his family and two of his students into a country house on the purchased land. He organized tours and hired locals for menial tasks. A wide range of artifacts were discovered on the site. These included coins, shards of pottery, jewelry, a bronze statuette of a dog, and even human remains. Correspondence of the time shows Reuvens persistent in trying to persuade the government of the value of excavating. When Belgium seceded from the kingdom in 1830, archaeology was the last thing the treasury could indulge, and eventually the estate was sold. The result of the project was unsatisfactory, though it had been the first professional archaeological field project conducted in the Netherlands. Reuvens findings would not be published until 1923 when the site had been revisited by archaeologist and RMO director Jan Hendrik Holwerda.

Biography Maximin Giraud was born on 26 August 1835, in Corps en Is√®re. His mother, Anne-Marie Templier hailed from this same region. His father, Germain Giraud was from the neighboring district of Tri√®ves.\\"Maximin Giraud\\", La Salette, Province of Mary, Mother of the Americas The mother died leaving Maximin, then 17 months old, and a daughter, Ang√©lique, who was eight years of age. Shortly after, Germain Giraud, a wheelwright by trade, remarried Marie Court. His new wife was reportedly not interested in Maximin and even neglected the child. Maximin grew up in haphazard fashion, spending much of his time with carefree abandon in the sole company of his dog and goat as they roamed the streets of Corps en Is√®re. Attendance at school was not compulsory and so he never attended classes. The same was true with regard to religious instructions. Giraud spoke the Vivaro-AlpineBert and Costa (2010: 18). (Dauphinois) dialect of the Occitan language, as did everybody in town, but he did learn a few words of French as he circulated among the wagon-drivers and travelers at the stage coach relays. He was 11 years old in 1846. =Life after the apparition= During the three years following the apparition, his half-brother Jean-Fran√ßois, his stepmother and his father died. His mother's brother, called oncle Templier became Maximin's guardian. After the apparition, he was placed as a boarder in the Sisters of Providence School in Corps en Is√®re, where an inquiry concerning the apparition took place. His progress in school was slow, hampered by constant pressure from pilgrims and other curious people. The children never contradicted the story of the apparition, despite being interrogated separately. Giraud went to Ars to meet Saint Jean Baptiste Marie Vianney three times, and was questioned by him about the apparitions. Giraud reportedly did not enjoy the visit but did enjoy the ride and the chance to see new sights. Due to the malice of an assistant priest of Vianney, a misunderstanding arose, which only after 8 years was resolved and the Cur√© once again confirmed his belief in the apparitions. Afterwards, Maximin moved from place to place. He entered the Minor Seminary of Rondeau in Grenoble, afterwards moving to the abbey of the Grande Chartreuse. From there, he travelled to Seyssin, and then to Rome, and thence to Dax, Aire-sur-l'Adour and Le V√©sinet, then to Tonnerre, to Jouy-en-Josas near Versailles, and finally Paris. Maximin tried his vocation as a seminarian, and after that, he worked as a nursing-home employee and a medical student.Dion, Henry. Maximin Giraud, Berger de La Salette, √âditions R√©siac: Montsurs, 1988 Failing the state examinations, he went to work in a pharmacy. In 1865, the Marquise de Pignerolles gave him a trip to Rome, where in April, Maximin enlisted as member of the Corps of Papal Zouaves, who were responsible for the defense of the Papal States and the protection of the Pope. Because of his time at the Paris Medical School in 1862 he was assigned to the Health Service as a nurse. His time in the Zouaves combined a religious element, with his interest in the military, and his medical training, in an atmosphere of camaraderie. While there, he worked on his memoirs, an account requested by Madame Jourdain. In his subsequent writings, Giraud noted with pride his service with the Zouaves. Giraud saw no major battles and after his enlistment ended, he returned to Paris.Laurent Gruaz, \\"Maximin Giraud, the shepherd of La Salette: the Apparition of the Virgin to the soldiers of the Pope,\\" Christians and societies, DOI: 10.4000/chretienssocietes.2827 The newspaper La Vie Parisienne published an attack on la Salette and the two children. Giraud protested and the newspaper printed a correction. In reaction towards this, in 1866 he published a short work called Ma profession de foi sur l'apparition de Notre-Dame de La Salette.Borrelli, Antonio. \\"Maximin Giraud\\", Santi Beati, April 6, 2006 It was during this time that the Jourdain family, a couple devoted to him, brought a measure of stability into his life, and, at financial risk to themselves, cleared his debts. In 1869, Giraud then entered into a partnership with a liquor dealer who used his now-famous name to increase sales. Giraud was fraudulently abused by him and failed to profit from the association. In 1870 he was drafted by the Imperial Army and assigned to Fort Barrau in Grenoble. Following this he returned to Corps and was joined there by the Jourdains. The three were poor but were helped by the fathers of the shrine with the approval of the bishop. In November 1874 Giraud made a pilgrimage to the shrine. In the presence of an audience he repeated the story of La Salette as he had done on the very first day. This would be the last time he would do so. In February 1875 he visited the parish church, also for the last time. =Death= Grave of Maximin Giraud, Corps On the evening of 1 March 1875, Giraud received the sacrament of Penance and Holy Communion, made his last Confession and drank the La Salette holy water to swallow the Eucharist. Shortly thereafter he died, not yet 40.\\"Witnesses: Melanie and Maximin\\", Notre Dame de La Salette His remains lie in the cemetery of Corps. He wanted to underscore once again his love for La Salette and solemnly proclaimed: Marian apparition On 19 September 1846, about three o'clock in the afternoon, on a mountain about three miles distant from the village of La Salette-Fallavaux, it is related that two children, a shepherdess of fifteen named M√©lanie Calvat, called Mathieu, and a shepherd-boy of eleven named Maximin Giraud, both of them uneducated, beheld in a resplendent light a \\"beautiful lady\\" clad in a strange costume. Speaking alternately in French and in patois, she passed a message which they were \\"to deliver to all her people\\". After complaining of the impiety of Christians, and threatening them with dreadful chastisements in case they should persevere in evil, she promised them the Divine mercy if they would amend.Clugnet, L√©on. \\"La Salette.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 30 Dec. 2012 The lady also said something in secret to each of the children. As she spoke to each in turn, the other could see her lips move, but could not hear what she said.St. John, Bernard, The Blessed Virgin the Nineteenth Century: Apparitions, Revelations, Graces,p.116, Burns & Oates, London, 1903 The apparition was approved by Mgr. Philibert de Bruillard, Bishop of Grenoble 16 November 1851 under the title of Our Lady of La Salette.\\"La Salette Apparition\\", Univ. of Dayton Both secrets were written down by the visionaries and sent to the pope in the same year. Maximin's secret Interpretation Sociologist Michael P. Carroll hypothesizes that the apparition may have grown out of an initial hallucination, shaped by an unconscious desire on the part of Maximin to punish his step-mother for mistreating him. Indications that Maximin may have on occasion gone hungry would be reflected in the predicted punishments relating to famine.Carroll, Michael P., The Cult of the Virgin: Psychological Origins, p.157, Princeton University Press, 1992 Both Melanie's and Maximin's initial impression of the weeping woman was that of a possible victim of domestic violence. In one interview, Maximin said that he thought of a woman \\"whose son had beaten her and then left her\\".Zimdars-Schwartz, Sandra L., Encountering Mary: From La Salette to Medjugorje, Princeton University Press, 2014 =Second edition ‚Äì 11 August 1851= An edition of 3 July 1851 was reproduced on request of Benjamin Dausse, a friend and trustee of Maximin. A third edition was produced on 5 August 1853 at the request of Jacques-Marie-Achille Ginoulhiac, the new bishop of Grenoble, who was unacquainted with the secret.

The name derives from the town/canton of Schwyz where it was developed. √ñrgeli is the diminutive form of the word Orgel (organ). Outside of Switzerland the instrument is not well known and is hard to find. History The accordion was brought to Switzerland in the 1830s, soon after its invention in Vienna. The earliest accordions were the typically one- or two- row diatonic button accordions, which carried on in Switzerland as the Langnauerli, named for Langnau in canton Bern. The Langnauerli usually has one treble row of buttons and two bass/chord buttons on the left hand end, much like the accordion used in Cajun music (minus the stops), but is sometimes seen with 2 or 3 rows on a stepped keyboard. The Schwyzer√∂rgeli was a further development from the 1880s, with changes in the treble fingering and a flat keyboard (not stepped), and unisonoric basses. The early makers including Eichhorn (Schwyz) and Nussbaumer (Bachenb√ºlach) experimented with different arrangements and numbers of buttons. The typical Schwyzer√∂rgeli today has 18 bass buttons arranged in two rows (one for bass notes and one for major chords), and 31 treble buttons on the RH arranged in 3 rows with a fingering similar to the 'club' system. The basses progress in 4ths like the Stradella system seen on chromatic and piano accordions, but in the opposite direction. Some Schwyzer√∂rgelis have fewer buttons in the upper/inside row on the RH much like the club models, or more buttons - sometimes an extra row on the outside - and fewer or more basses. Since Swiss music rarely uses minor chords, even √ñrgelis with 4 bass rows usually have no minor chords but majors and 7ths instead. The only other variety still being made in substantial numbers today is the Schwyzer√∂rgeli with chromatic fingering, usually with a C system (C-Griff) treble side and Stradella bass fingering. Tuning As most diatonic accordions are centered on certain keys, the Schwyzer√∂rgeli is usually tuned in 'flat' keys to fit with the clarinet, with the outer row giving a B scale, the next row E, and the next giving a mixture of notes allowing music to be played in A, D and G when fingered across the rows. Of course this means each key has a different fingering. This instrument is labelled a 'B-√ñrgeli' or 'B/Es' (B/E). Less common keys are A/D, C/F and B/E. The Schwyzer√∂rgeli has a unique tuning (tone, voicing), called Schwyzerton. On the treble side, each button has 3 sets of reeds, with one main set and two other sets an octave higher than the first, each tuned slightly apart to give a somewhat tremolo sound. The reeds are arranged around one big reed block with a tone chamber inside, rather than a separate reed block for each row like most accordions. Some √ñrgelis only have 2 sets of reeds tuned an octave apart, Bandonion-style. The √ñrgeli with 2 sets of treble reeds of the same octave, tuned slightly apart (tremolo or 'wet'), is called a Wiener√∂rgeli (Viennese √ñrgeli) because of the 'Viennese' tuning (Wienerton) which is widespread among button accordions around the world such as those made by Hohner and the Steirische Harmonika. The internal construction (RH reed blocks) of this √ñrgeli also is not like the others but more like other accordions, but the fingering and the appearance is of the typical Schwyzer√∂rgeli. In Canton Bern, there is a variety of Schwyzer√∂rgeli called the Berner√∂rgeli, pioneered by Ernst Salvisberg, distinguished primarily by a beveled bass end and usually dry tuning (no tremolo), called Bernerton.

WOPI is owned and operated by Glenwood Communications Corporation, though subsidiary Holston Valley Broadcasting Corporation. History WOPI signed on June 15, 1929 at State and 22nd Streets in Bristol, Tennessee as the first radio station in the Tri-Cities. W.A. Wilson, former chief telegraph operator for Western Union's Bristol office, came up with the plan for a radio station when he spent several years selling and installing radios. His son James C. Wilson worked at WOPI and later bought the station which is now WJCW. An early show on the station was \\"WOPI Jamboree\\", which featured live country music. In the 1940s WOPI and WKPT formed a network called \\"the Sister City Network\\" for broadcasting local information. WOPI-FM signed on Christmas Day 1946 as the area's first FM station. It was sold to the owner of WKYE in the 1960s and is now WXBQ-FM. In 1966, owner Tri-Cities Broadcasting Company successfully requested that the FCC change the city of license to Bristol, Tennessee- Virginia. In 1990, WOPI was bankrupt and Joe Morrell bought the station. Morrell wanted to increase the amount of country music on the station, bringing it back to its roots. Later, WOPI joined the WKPT network. Translator In addition to the main station, WOPI is relayed by an FM translator to widen its broadcast area.

It is named after the highest peak of the island of Tortola, Mount Sage. The Mount Sage volcanic peak rises to a height of , and is thus the highest point in all of the Virgin Islands. The park is located to the southwest of the island group's capital, Road Town. The park, which includes the mountain range, extends over an area of . The vegetation is of semi-rain forest type. There are many trails for trekking and hiking. History The national park was established in 1964, covering an area of 35 ha. It was the first national park in the British Virgin Islands to preserve and reserve the remaining forests and its adjoining watershed areas. The reserve area was acquired from private farmers by the Government with a grant provided by Laurance Rockefeller, and was given to the National Park Trust in 1964 for making it a forest reserve for conservation purposes. Geography Approach to the national park is from the north west of Road Town along the Joe Hill Road which is the main highway, to Leonards Road and then turning left to the Ridge Road, which leads to the car park at the park entrance. The average park elevation is about above sea level. The topography is dictated by the ridge that runs in an east-west direction in the middle of Tortola Island with elevation range from between the western end of the island to Mount Sage. The tall, volcanic mountain range acts like a natural barrier, blocking dry winds and strong sun shine. Rains occur from the moist trade winds generated in the Tortola's mountains and falls mostly on the northern side of the park, supporting a few forest species, while the southern part of the park reflect old pastures of dry forests. A small area of , which is generally of rocky terrain, retains the original forest species as they could not be cleared for agriculture. Tree plantations already existed, with the plantations of West Indies Mahogany and White Cedar. Over the years, natural regeneration has also taken place. Features There is a north coast overlook and a tower, which provides scenic views of Jost Van Dyke, Tobagoes, little Sandy Cay, the north coast and, St. Thomas. Sir Francis Drake Channel of outlying islands from Virgin Gorda to St. John can be seen by a short detour along the Joseph R. O'Neal Trail to the peak. The park has twelve trails forming a circular route; trails are well marked with signs. Trails include the Central Trail, also known as the Rainforest Trail, flanked by the North Trail and the South Trail. The Mahogany Forest Trail, which goes up to the top of Mount Sage, was established by Joseph Reynold O'Neal, the founder and first Chairman of the National Parks Trust. The best preserved forest area is viewable from the Henry Adams Loop Trail, which includes steps. Wildlife The old-growth forest on Mount Sage is noted to be \\"untouched since the time of Columbus\\". Typical of rainforests, flora includes the \\"stinking fish\\" or bullet wood (Mimusops elengi), Caribbean and Honduras mahogany trees (Swietenia mahogoni, and S. macrophylla). Other flora found within the park are guavaberry, large patches of moss, epiphytes or air plants, elephant ear vine (philodendron), fig tree, white \\"cedar\\" (not actually a cedar but a flowering tree, Tabebuia heterophylla), a West Indian species of tree fern, manilkara, and mountain guava (Psidium amplexicaule). Groves of mammee apple (Mammea americana) and heliconia trees are also recorded along the entrance path of the park. Some of the ferns, flowers, and vines which grow in the park are not found elsewhere on Tortola. Hermit Crab Fauna reported from the park are hermit crab (Calliactis).

The site was discovered in 2001 and is being developed as a joint venture between Turquoise Hill Resources (a majority owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto) with 66% ownership and the Government of Mongolia with 34%. The mine began construction as of 2010 and shipped its first batch of copper on 9 July 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi mining project is the largest financial undertaking in Mongolia's history and is expected upon completion to produce of copper annually. Financing for the project has come in part from the Rio Tinto Group and an investment agreement between Ivanhoe Mines and the government of Mongolia. History Canadian- based Ivanhoe Mines discovered the gold-copper ore deposit in 2001 in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. It is in an area known as Oyu Tolgoi (Mongolian for Turquoise Hill), where in the time of Genghis Khan outcropping rocks were smelted for copper. The place was suspected to have mineralization by Mongolian geologists since 1950s. By 2003 there were 18 exploration drill rigs on the property employing approximately 200 people, and Oyu Tolgoi was the \\"biggest mining exploration project in the world.\\" In January 2013 Oyu Tolgoi started producing concentrate from the mine. Description The Oyu Tolgoi mine is in the South Gobi Desert of Mongolia, north of Mongolia's border with the People's Republic of China, where the mined copper is expected to be shipped. Oyu Tolgoi deposits contain an estimated 2,700,000 tonnes of copper and of gold. It also contains 1,900 tonnes of silver and 205,000 tonnes of molybdenum. Production began in 2013 and is scheduled to reach full capacity in 2021. Over the anticipated lifespan of the mine (>50 years), Oyu Tolgoi is scheduled to produce of copper per year, an amount equal to 3% of global production. Oyu Tolgoi is also expected to produce of gold annually, with \\"by- product silver and molybdenum\\". Rio Tinto intends to employ 3,000‚Äì4,000 people from Mongolia. Mining and milling Oyu Tolgoi will use both underground and open pit mining techniques. Initially the mine will process 70,000 tonnes of rock per day, ramping up to 85,000 tonnes from both the open pit and the underground mine (underground mining is to be done by block caving). The yield from the first phase of mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day. Financing thumb As of 2010, the estimated cost of bringing the Oyu Tolgoi mine into production was US$4.6 billion, making it (financially) the largest project in Mongolian history; however, by 2013 costs had ballooned to $10 billion, which caused some concern for the Government of Mongolia, which borrows its 34 percent share of investment from the foreign investors with interest. The mine is said to account for more than 30% of Mongolia's GDP upon completion. In early 2010 global mining company Rio Tinto owned 22.4% of Oyu Tolgoi owner Ivanhoe Mines (now Turquoise Hill Resources), and gave both technical assistance and financial support to the project. At the time Rio Tinto had the option of increasing their stake to 46.6%. On 31 March 2010 the Government of Mongolia approved an investment agreement where they would purchase 34% of the project. In October 2010, Ivanhoe announced a new US$1 billion share offering in order to raise funds to develop this mine. Rio Tinto increased its ownership of Ivanhoe in December 2010, also assuming direct management of the design and construction of the project, however without fulfilling another aim, to achieve direct ownership of the mine.Tio's peace pact tames Canadian copper monster The Australian, published: 10 December 2010. Retrieved 10 December 2010 Disagreement between the Mongolian government and Rio Tinto came to a head in 2013, with the government urging Rio Tinto to settle the US$340 million tax issue and the cost overruns from the initially planned US$5.1 billion to US$7.1 billion during the initial stage of the project. In July 2013, the shares in Turquoise Hill Resources (Rio Tinto's unit that controls 66% of the mine) dropped 20% after a dispute between Tserenbat Sedvanchig, the executive director of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi (the state-owned company that controls the other 34%), and Rio Tinto. Sedvanchig was fired in August and replaced by Davaadorj Ganbold, a former deputy minister and member of parliament. In the meantime, Rio Tinto cut 1700 Mongolian employees from the mining operation. On 21 November 2019, the parliament of Mongolia adopted a resolution on \\"Ensuring Interests and Rights of Mongolia in the Exploitation of Oyu Tolgoi Deposit,\\" which instructs the government (Cabinet) to look into \\"a product sharing arrangement\\" or swap its 34% equity with \\"a special royalty\\".

It is estimated that the water demand will triple in the coming two decades mainly due to mineral exploitation in the area. Herders worry that Oyu Tolgoi is draining the region's water supply, since it uses more than a billion gallons of water a month. In addition, there is a substantial risk of acid rock drainage from the mine, from tailings storage facilities and from any overburden or waste rock stored on the surface and not deposited back into the mine.

Steel fence that surrounds the gaping mine blocks traditional herding corridors and makes it difficult for the herd animals to find water. Roads constructed by the mine owners present additional barriers to animals. Some Mongolian herders forced to resettle because of the Oyu Tolgoi expansion have experienced herd loss. They were forced to move to inferior locations without adequate time to select spots that would protect their animals from harsh winter storms.

Proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986, following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record; the first coming in 1983, when Tom Petranoff, then of the United States, added precisely three meters to Paragi's mark, and the other in 1984, when East German Uwe Hohn launched the 800 gram implement to 104.80 meters. Hohn's mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed, and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change. Indeed, the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings, which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal, most famously in the high- profile case at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the eventual winner Dainis K≈´la only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw. Ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately, compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot. Paragi also competed at the Moscow Olympics. Even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 96.20 on 18 May 1980, there could be no question he was among the leading favorites. However, he had problems in the qualifying round, languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a sub-standard mark of 72.60, but saved himself by throwing 88.76 with his third and final attempt - the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters. Next day in the final however, he could do no better than 79.52 and finished in tenth place. His qualification performance would have been enough for a bronze.

It also consist of a Branch of Special forces namely The G.I.P.M (Groupe intervention de la Police Mauricien) which adds up to no more than 300 highly trained Men. History The SMF was formed following the withdrawal of the British garrison on Mauritius in 1960. The primary task of the SMF when it was formed was to ensure the internal security of the country. As formed, the SMF was made up of members of the local police force and Mauritian veterans of the Second World War. Organisation The SMF is formed as a battlegroup consisting of approximately 1,500 men led by a Commanding Officer. The majority of these men form five motorised infantry companies. In addition, there are two squadrons equipped with armoured vehicles and an engineering squadron. Although the SMF is not a military unit, it is organised along military lines, with training based on basic military doctrine. Some members of the SMF undergo commando training or \\"specialist\\" training, dependent on their skills. Although the primary role of the SMF is the internal and external security of Mauritius, it is also used in several other roles such as ceremonial guards of honour, search and rescue operations, bomb disposal, debris clearance and opening of roads after cyclones and other emergencies. Badge and motto The badge of the SMF is made up of a wreath of oak leaves surmounted by the national coat of arms. Within the wreath are the letters S and F, with a lightning flash between them, to symbolise the letters \\"SMF\\". Beneath the wreath is a scroll with the name \\"Special Mobile Force Mauritius\\".

He was awarded the Hector and Marsden Medals and was an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for his contributions to the study of Pacific culture history. Early life and education Roger Green was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and expressed an interest in archaeology at an early age.Davidson, Janet, 1999. Roger Curtis Green. In T. Murray, ed. Encyclopedia of Archaeology: The Great Archaeologists. Santa Barbara:ABC-CLIO. At sixteen, his family relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where his interest in North American prehistory flourished. Following a field season on Pueblo sites in the region under the tutelage of Frank Hibben, Green attended the University of New Mexico. While there, he undertook coursework in geology and linguistics in addition to anthropology, while at the same time being engaged in officers training. He was particularly influenced by the work of linguist Edward Sapir during this period, which likely contributed to his subsequent works in Polynesian linguistics. During this period, Green continued to work on local field projects, resulting in his first published works.e.g. Green, Roger C., 1956. A pit house of the Gallina phase. American Antiquity 22:10‚Äì16 His talents were recognised early on by his professors at New Mexico, and before completing his Masters study there, Green was encouraged to enroll in a doctorate program at Harvard. While there he studied closely under Gordon Willey and Cora du Bois. It was also there that he was first introduced to Pacific prehistory by Douglas Oliver, who helped arrange a Fulbright fellowship that took him to New Zealand and on to conduct research in French Polynesia on the islands of Moorea and Mangareva. His PhD dissertation focused on the prehistoric sequence of the Auckland region. Academic career Following his doctoral work in the Pacific, Green replaced Jack Golson as a senior lecturer of Anthropology at The University of Auckland from 1961 to 1966. In 1966, he was promoted to associate professor, and worked for the next three years at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa. From 1970 to 1973, he worked on an extensive research project with Douglas Yen in the Solomon Islands funded by a Captain James Cook Fellowship, after which he returned to Auckland for the remainder of his teaching career. He retired from teaching in 1992, at which time he was made Professor Emeritus. In addition to teaching at Auckland and Hawaii, Green periodically held active teaching and research positions at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, and Te Whare WƒÅnanga o AwanuiƒÅrangi in Whakatane, New Zealand. He also oversaw the funding of numerous research projects through the Green Foundation for Polynesian Research.For example, Allen, M.S. 2006. Periodicity, duration, and function of occupation at Tauroa Point, Northland, New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 27:19‚Äì62. During his teaching career, Green taught a number of students who would later make significant contributions to New Zealand and Pacific archaeology, including Janet Davidson, Les Groube, Andrew Pawley, Lisa Matisoo-Smith. Contributions Green at Tairua Site, 1964 Green's earliest work was focused primarily on the Largo-Gallina phase of the Pueblo Native Americans.

Among his methodological contributions, Green was well known for his work on obsidian dating and provenance, an invaluable tool in Pacific archaeology. Additionally, he made significant contributions to settlement pattern archaeology, particularly with his work in Moorea and Samoa. The Green Foundation, established in 1984 by Green and his wife, Valerie, was an initiative which was started with diverted earnings from fee paying work Green was involved in.

It takes place every year during the first full week of October. During this week, mental health advocates and organizations across the U.S. join to sponsor events to promote community outreach and public education concerning mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Examples of activities held during the week include art/music events, educational sessions provided by healthcare professionals and individuals with lived experience and/or familial lived experience, advertising campaigns, health fairs, prayer services, movie nights, candlelight vigils, and benefit runs. As of 2017, over 46 million (almost 1 out of 5) U.S. adults live with a mental illness. 4.5% of U.S. adults (over 11 million) have a Serious Mental Illness (SMI). The numbers may be larger because stigma reduces reporting.Not only are these adults affected by one mental illness; 45 percent of these adults meet criteria for two or more disorders.http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7628/20140527/1-4-u-s-adults- suffer-diagnosable-mental-disorder-given.htm These range from fairly common mood disorders to the much more serious anxiety and schizophrenia disorders. Among these, anxiety disorders were the most common, as some 40 million American adultages 18 and older experience some form of anxiety disorder.http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7628/20140527/1-4-u-s-adults- suffer-diagnosable-mental-disorder-given.htm Despite the large number of Americans affected by such disorders, stigma surrounding mental illness is a major barrier that prevents people from seeking the mental health treatment that they need. Programs during Mental Illness Awareness Week are designed to create community awareness and discussion in an effort to put an end to stigma and advocate for treatment and recovery. Mental Illness Awareness Week coincides with similar organization campaigns in early October such as World Mental Health DayWorld Mental Health Day (World Federation for Mental Health), National Depression Screening Day (Screening for Mental Health), and National Day Without StigmaNational Day Without Stigma (Active Minds). While mental illness awareness week has begun to break stigmas in communities, many still remain. Most mental illness appears in the early to mid-twenties of most and tends to take on average 6-8 years for the affected to step forward and reach out for help and treatment. Many organizations have begun to lend their help on ending the stigma and assuring society that taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health. IDONTMIND is a national program of Mental Health America, dedicated to using a lifestyle brand to help end stigmas around mental health. IDONTMIND was founded by Chris Wood in 2017 and has raised over $350,000 for mental health organizations.

Kurdistan Region and Israel do not have an official status of relations, though there are claims that there are numerous contacts between the entities on government and business levels. Iran and Syria have accused Kurdistan Region of having relations with Israel. Massoud Barzani, president of Kurdistan Region and leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, claimed in 2005 that \\"establishing relations between the Kurds and Israel is not a crime since many Arab countries have ties with the Jewish state.\\" Historical background =History of the Jews in Kurdistan= The Jewish community in Mesopotamia was one of the oldest in the world, dating back to the Babylonian conquest of the southern tribes of Israel, (mostly the tribe of Judah) in 586 BCE. A smaller group of Israelites were taken into captivity almost 150 years earlier from the northern part of Israel by Assyria, in 722 BCE. There were times when Jews flourished in Babylon, producing the Babylonian Talmud there between the years 500 and 700 CE. Based on these relations, the Jews of Kurdistan lived freely alongside Muslims and Christians for generations in relative security. Those that immigrated to Israel would reminisce about the positive experiences they and their fathers and forefathers had in the tribal Kurdish society. Without these roots, the state of Israel would have never been able to connect sincerely with the Kurdish leadership, which was mostly tribal. =Kurdish Jews in modern times= The Sufi Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi from the Barzani family were among the most respected and influential in Kurdistan.Van Bruinessen 1978: 344-48. The family became an influential tribe that played an important role in the Kurdish national movement. Wigram noted that the Shaikh of BarzƒÅn was \\"a merciful over-lord,\\" noted for his fair treatment of his followers. The leaders of this particular Naqshbandi family, during the first half of the 20th century, notably Shaikh Ahmad and Mustafa Barzani, had \\"special relationships with the Kurdish Jews under their patronage.\\" Zaken also provides details on the good relations between the Khawaja Khinno patriarchs and the Barzanis, which, reportedly, the authorities wished to use. In one case the Turkish authorities asked the Jewish merchant Eliyahu Khawaja Khinno from Aqrah to mediate between them and Shaikh Abd al-Salam Barzani, who was an insurgent tribal leader. In the second account, it was the British authorities who wanted to use the good trust between the Barzanis and the Jewish leaders of Aqrah. Another account that symbolizes the trust between the tribal heads of Barzanis and the Jews of Aqra, takes place in 1944, when MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ concluded a tribal pact with the heads of the Zƒ´barƒ´ tribe, in order to reinforce his leadership among the Kurdish tribes. To seal this pact with a marriage contract, MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ and Shaikh Ahmad were to marry daughters of the Zƒ´barƒ´ tribal leaders. According to members of Khawaja Khinno family, in 1944, MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ was about to depart from Aqraj and Both David and Yitzhak Khawaja Khinno, accompanied him to say farewell. Before his departure, at the courtyard in front of the police station of Aqra, he distanced himself from the crowd and consulted with the two brothers. MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ told David: \\"HƒÅjjƒ´ QƒÅdir Agha [Zƒ´barƒ´] spoke with me about marrying his sister and Shaikh Mahm≈´d Agha [Zƒ´barƒ´] spoke with me about marrying his daughter... What do you think?\\" David Khawaja Khinno told him: \\"I suggest that the sister of HƒÅjjƒ´ QƒÅdir Agha be given to Shaikh Ahmad and you should take the daughter of Mahmud Agha.\\" MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ Barzani told him: \\"well, in that case, would you prepare gold [jewelry] for her?\\" In 1944, when Eliyahu Khawaja Khinno died, MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ came in person to Aqrah to pay his condolences. This memorable visit demonstrates, in the eyes of the Jewish residents of Aqrah, the special bond between the two families. To the amazement of the Kurds of Aqrah, Barzani visited them first, before he visited important Shaikhs such as Abd al-WahhƒÅb and MustafƒÅ MullƒÅ JibrƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l. During this visit, David Khawaja Khinno honored Barzani with a golden dagger, decorated with three gold buttons, and a pistol. According to Aryeh Gabbai, BarzƒÅnƒ´ told them: ‚ÄúI am taking the dagger but not the pistol, which you may need. We have [enough] weapons.‚Äù On the same occasion, in front of the tribal chiefs who accompanied him, MullƒÅ MustafƒÅ emphasized the bond that existed with the Khawaja Khinno family, and the need to continue to protect the family which was dear to him: :\\"You know very well that this family is dear to me... We are regarded one family, in spite of our different religions. I do not want any harm to happen to them. One sentence that seemed to capture the essence of this unique visit among the Jews was: ‚ÄúWe felt very unique, [we did] not [feel] the usual feeling [of inferiority] that Jews would feel towards the Muslims, fearing that some harm may come to us.‚Äù The special relations between the Barzani tribal chiefs and the patriarchs of the family of Khawaja Khinno continued even after the exodus of Mustafa Barzani to Russia in 1947 and the mass migration of the Jews to the State of Israel from 1951 to 1952. Following the collapse of the Republic of Mahabad at the end of 1946, Mustafa Barzani went into exile in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. His wife and son, returned to Iraq. During World War II and especially at the end of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1947, a drastic reduction in the Jewish population of Iraq began, affecting also the Jews inhabiting the northern Kurdish-dominated regions. In 1950, Iraqi Jews (including Baghdadi, Kurdish and other Jews of Iraq) were given permission to leave within one year, on condition that they renounce their Iraqi citizenship. One year later the Jews who left had their property frozen. Jews who had chosen to stay in Iraq had economic restrictions placed on them. The Jews of the Kurdish regions evacuated entirely, all coming to Israel. In response to intense international pressure in the early 1970s, Iraq caved in and allowed whatever Jews still remained there to leave. As of 2004 about 35 Jews were still living in Baghdad, but by 2008 that number declined to less than 10. Since the mid-20th century the population of the Jews in northern Iraq, specifically in Kurdistan, was hence decimated. However, there are signs that there are some \\"hidden Jews\\" still residing in Kurdish areas and some came back from Israel to stay. These were the foundations upon which, during the 1960s and 1970s, the Israeli government established relations with the Barzani chieftain, Mulla Mustafa Barzani, who had become the most important leader of the Kurds. =Israeli support for KDP in 1960s and 1970s= According to Eliezer Tsafrir, a former senior Mossad official, in 1963‚Äì1975 Israel had military advisers at the headquarters of Mulla Mustafa Barzani, and trained and supplied the Kurdish units with firearms and field and anti- aircraft artillery. Political relations Jewish organizations worldwide started lobbying campaigns to aid the Kurds in Kurdistan Region during the Operation Desert Storm to stop the Iraqi government's persecutions.Barron A. \\"US and Israeli Jews Express Support for Kurdish Refugees\\" // Washington Report of Middle East Affairs, May‚ÄìJune 1991, p. 64. Israel also provided, through Turkish Kurdistan, first aid items to Kurdistan Region, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, during a meeting with US Secretary of State James Baker called on the American government to defend the Kurds. Israeli media in 2004 reported about the meetings of Israeli officials with Kurdish political leaders when Massoud Barzani, Jalal Talabani and the former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon publicly confirmed the good relations Kurdistan Region. The president of Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, answered a question while visiting Kuwait in May 2006 about the Kurdish‚ÄìIsraeli relationship: \\"It is not a crime to have relations with Israel. If Baghdad established diplomatic relations with Israel, we could open a consulate in Erbil.\\" Israeli television has in the past broadcast photographs from the 1960s showing Massoud Barzani's father, Mustafa Barzani, embracing the then Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan. In a policy address in 2014, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu supported the establishment of an independent Kurdish state. He claimed that: \\"The Kurds are a fighting people that have proven political commitment and political moderation, and they're also worthy of their own political independence.\\" According to recent reports, there are between 400‚Äì730 Jewish families living in the Kurdish region. On 18 October 2015, the Kurdistan Regional Government named Sherzad Omar Mamsani, a Kurdish Jew, as the Jewish representative of the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs. Israel became the first state to support the independence of Kurdistan Region, however it has not recognized it as an independent state. Military relations In 2004, it was reported by the New Yorker magazine, that allegedly Israeli military and intelligence operatives are active in Kurdish areas of Iran, Syria and Iraq, providing training for commando units and running covert operations. In response, Israel's embassy in Washington denied the claim, which was sourced in the magazine mainly to an unnamed former and current intelligence officials in Israel, the US and Turkey. According to 2006 BBC report, there was evidence that Israeli experts were dispatched to Kurdistan Region to provide training to Peshmerga. Kurdish officials refused to comment on the report and Israel denied it knows of any involvement. Humanitarian aid =Israeli aid during the 2010s= In September 2014, following an ISIS offensive in North Iraq, the Israeli NGO agency IsraAid announced to provide urgent assistance to Christians and Yezidis in Kurdistan Region, together with the American Jewish Committee. In October 2014, IsraAID agency provided humanitarian supplies to refugees within the Kurdish region of Iraq, fleeing the ISIL terror campaign. The IsraAid provided supplies to 1,000 families in Dohuk towards the winter, including beds, baby milk and blankets. The IsraAid assistance was provided in collaboration with the Canadian ONEXONE agency and was coordinated with the KRG. IsraAID's Founding Director Shahar Zahavi told Arutz Sheva that the Israeli team were warmly received by the Kurdish residents of the camp. By early 2015, IsraAid trucks provided 3,000 items to Dohuk in Kurdistan Region, helping Christian and Yezidi refugees. Role of Kurdish Jews in Israel Jewish immigration from Ottoman Empire to the Land of Israel (then Damascus Eyalet and Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem) began in the 16th century, with the first Jewish immigrants from Kurdistan settling in Safed. Kurdish Jewish immigrants later on in the 20th century arrived in the 1920s and 1930s, and by the year 1948 there were some 8,000 Kurdish Jews in Israel. Today, the Jewish population of Kurdish background in Israel is estimated over 150,000; the largest concentration of Kurdish Jews can be found around Jerusalem. The Jews of Kurdish extraction play an important part in maintaining unofficial cultural and business relations between Israel and Kurdistan Region.

The dam creates Bartlett Lake and its primary purpose is irrigation water supply. It was the first dam constructed on the Verde River and the first of its type constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. It was built between 1936 and 1939. It was named after Bill Bartlett, a government surveyor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History The dam under construction in 1939. In response to the Great Depression and subsequent drops in crop prices, farmers struggled harder to have a dam constructed on the Verde River. Finally, in 1935, the Salt River Project received approval to build the Bartlett Dam. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation constructed the dam between 1936 and 1939, in a total of 1,000 days. Upon completion, the dam was the tallest multiple arch buttress type in the world at the time. 80% of the funding for the dam was provided by the Salt River Project (SRP) and 20% by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Construction on the dam provided needed jobs and flood control on the river. Although flood waters temporarily halted construction in February, 1937, flooding was finally minimized with the construction of the dam. The next large flood in the area would not come until the winter of 1965-66. Because of safety concerns, the dam was later modified during the mid-1990s by the Bureau of Reclamation. Beginning in March 1994, the dam was raised and subsequently, its service spillway was modified as well to accompany the new height. An unlined auxiliary spillway was also constructed about south of the dam's left abutment. The new spillway consists of a concrete control structure and a three-segment fuse plug which is designed to erode in specific stages during flooding. The modifications to the dam were complete in December 1996. Specifications A view of the dam and both spillways The Bartlett dam consists of 10 arches, 9 buttresses, and is flanked by 2 gravity wing dams.

The ship commissioned as CGS D'Iberville for the Department of Transport's Marine Service, using the prefix \\"Canadian Government Ship\\", D'Iberville was transferred into the newly-created Canadian Coast Guard in 1962. When launched, she was the largest icebreaker in use by Canada post-World War II until was put in service. In 1984, the icebreaker was renamed Phillip O'Hara before returning to her old name in 1988. In 1989 the vessel was sold for scrap and broken up at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Design and description D'Iberville was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The icebreaker had a fully loaded displacement of , a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 5,678 and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 3,600. The ship was propelled by two screws powered by two six-cylinder Skinner uniflow steam engines creating . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The ship had a hangar as part of the superstructure that could hold two Bell 47 helicopters and a flight deck over the stern of the ship, but usually only operated one helicopter. Service history The icebreaker was constructed by Davie Shipbuilding at their yard in Lauzon, Quebec with the yard number 590 and was launched on 12 June 1952. The vessel entered into service with the Department of Transport's Marine Service as CGS D'Iberville in May 1953, named for the French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Upon completion, D'Iberville became Canada's first modern icebreaker. Following completion of her sea trials, D'Iberville sailed to England as part of Canada's representation at Queen Elizabeth II's coronation review along with warships from the Royal Canadian Navy. The ship was based at Quebec City, Quebec and saw service in the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence. In 1953, on the icebreaker's first Arctic voyage, D'Iberville helped establish the Royal Canadian Mounted Police post at Alexandria Fjord on Ellesmere Island. That year, D'Iberville and the Arctic patrol vessel participated in the controversial forced resettlement of Inuit families from Port Harrison in Northern Quebec to Ellesmere Island. On 29 April 1959, the Saint Lawrence Seaway was opened for the first time and D'Iberville and were the first ships to transit the lock at Saint-Lambert, Quebec. In 1962, like all icebreaking vessels of the Department of Transport's Marine Service, she was transferred to the newly created Canadian Coast Guard. In 1972, D'Iberville was one of three icebreaking escorts for a convoy of cargo ships travelling to Mokka Fjord and Eureka. This was the largest convoy to travel that far north into Canada's Arctic. In 1976, in conjunction with , D'Iberville travelled into the Northwest Passage to aid after the small icebreaker damaged both her propellers. In 1981, D'Iberville made her last Arctic voyage. The ship was decommissioned in 1983. The vessel was laid up first at Quebec City, then at Sorel. Renamed Phillip O'Hara in 1984 and back to D'Iberville in 1988, the icebreaker was sold for scrap in 1989 and broken up at Kaoshiung, Taiwan.

Saint Augustine's mother was named Monica, and she was born in Numidia, North Africa, although she also was a citizen of Carthage, hence the possibility it may be of Punic origin. It has also been associated with the Greek word monos, meaning \\"alone\\". Monica was also a name in Latin, deriving from the verb monere, meaning 'to advise.' Saint Monica's feast day is 27 August (in the new Roman Catholic calendar, but was traditionally observed on May 4th), and Monica is the patron saint of married women. One of the early occurrences of the name in literature is the character Monica Thorne in the 1858 novel Doctor Thorne by Anthony Trollope. = Popularity = In the United States, the name's popularity reached a peak in 1977 when it was the 39th most popular female name for new births. The popularity has gradually waned since then, being 76th most popular in 1990, and 363rd in 2010.\\"Popular Baby Names\\", United States Social Security Administration, search term: \\"Monica\\".

The company revived its haute couture collection in 2015 under former Creative Director Hedi Slimane. In April 2016, Anthony Vaccarello was appointed as Creative Director.Anthony Vaccarello Stuck to His Sexy DNA at Saint Laurent, V√©ronique Hyland, New York February 28, 2017Vanessa Friedman, The Apocalypse Comes to Saint Laurent The New York Times March 1, 2017Mark Holgate, \\"My Idea of YSL Lies in the Attitude\\"‚ÄîAnthony Vaccarello Talks Saint Laurent Vogue September 27, 2016 Founded in 1961, it has been considered one of the world's most prominent fashion houses and is known for its modern and iconic pieces, such as its tuxedo jackets for women. Today, Saint Laurent markets a broad range of women's and men's ready-to-wear products, leather goods, shoes and jewellery. Yves Saint Laurent Beaut√© also has a notable presence in the luxury beauty and fragrance market, although this is owned by L'Or√©al, which holds exclusive licenses for the name.  History  Evening dress by Tom Ford for YSL Rive Gauche, 2004 The eponymous brand was founded in 1961 by designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berg√©, and the current logos were designed in 1963 by A. M. Cassandre. During the 1960s and 1970s, the firm popularized fashion trends such as the beatnik look, safari jackets for men and women, tight pants and tall, thigh-high boots, including the creation of arguably the most famous classic tuxedo suit for women in 1966, Le Smoking suit. Some of his most memorable collections include the Pop Art, Ballet Russes, Picasso, and Chinese ones. He also started mainstreaming the idea of wearing silhouettes from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. He was the first, in 1966, to popularize ready-to-wear in an attempt to democratize fashion, with Rive Gauche and a boutique of the same name.Alicia Drake. The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris. Little, Brown and Company, 2006. p.49. Among Saint Laurent's muses were Loulou de La Falaise, the daughter of a French marquis and an Anglo-Irish fashion model; Betty Catroux, the half-Brazilian daughter of an American diplomat and wife of a French decorator; Talitha Pol-Getty, a model and actress whose husband was a Getty heir; and Catherine Deneuve, the French actress. The brand continued to expand in the 1980s and early 1990s with fragrances for both men and women, having launched its cosmetic line in 1978. However, by 1992, the company's profits were declining and the company's share price had fallen. In 1993, the Saint Laurent fashion house was sold to the pharmaceuticals company Sanofi. In the 1998‚Äì1999 seasons, Alber Elbaz, formerly of Lanvin, designed three ready-to-wear collections. Pierre Berg√© appointed Hedi Slimane as collections and art director in 1997, and they relaunched YSL Rive Gauche Homme. Slimane decided to leave the house two years later, and he became head of couture menswear at Dior Homme. In 1999, Gucci (owned by PPR) bought the YSL brand and asked Tom Ford to design the ready-to-wear collection, while Saint Laurent would design the haute couture collection. In 2002, dogged by years of poor health, drug abuse, depression, alcoholism, and criticisms of YSL designs, Saint Laurent closed the couture house of YSL. Reflecting on his career and impact on the fashion industry, Saint Laurent was heavily quoted around the world for stating, \\"Chanel freed women, and I empowered them.\\" Saint Laurent also stated, \\"I created the contemporary woman's wardrobe.\\" upright The pr√™t-√†-porter line was produced under the direction of Stefano Pilati, after Tom Ford left in 2004. His style was decidedly more French than the overtly sexy image that Tom Ford propagated. In 2009, following the death of Yves Saint Laurent in 2008 and a tumultuous first few years for Stefano Pilati, a few YSL stores closed in key U.S. markets of San Francisco and New York City. The New York location, on Madison Avenue, had been the brand's first in the United States, having opened in 1969. In January 2010, the Chicago boutique on Oak Street closed as well. In 2012, Kering (previously known as PPR) announced that Hedi Slimane replaced Stefano Pilati as the creative director. Slimane had previously worked with Dior Homme until 2007. In 2015, Slimane announced that he would be reviving Yves Saint Laurent's couture line. In 2016, Slimane left Saint Laurent. His replacement is Anthony Vaccarello. Despite the fact that Slimane had previously worked with the house, there was much controversy following his appointment, particularly after it was announced that the ready-to-wear line would be rebranded as Saint Laurent. However, the Yves Saint Laurent name and YSL logo have been retained for accessories such as handbags and shoes, and cosmetics (which are licensed to L'Or√©al). It was also announced that the design studio would move to Los Angeles, California, Slimane's adopted home, while the couture atelier would remain in France. Slimane stated that he drew inspiration from when the ready- to-wear line was first launched as Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. However, the decision made headlines around the world. It became more controversial after it was reported that famed Parisian boutique Colette was selling shirts with the line \\"Ain't Laurent without Yves.\\" Saint Laurent requested the store to stop selling the shirts, which it did in its online store. In October 2013, it was reported that Colette received a letter accusing it of selling counterfeit products that seriously damaged the brand. Following the accusation, it was announced that Saint Laurent had canceled Colette's order for its Spring 2014 Collection, despite the fact that the boutique had been stocking the brand since 1998. Charlotte Gainsbourg appeared in the brand's FW17 ad campaign In 2017, creative director Anthony Vaccarello chose Charlotte Gainsbourg, the daughter of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, as the face of the FW17 campaign.hero-magazine.com Charlotte Gainsbourg is the new face of Saint Laurent, ALEX JAMES TAYLOR, 18 MAY 2017 In 2020, Ros√© from BLACKPINK was chosen as the global ambassador for Saint Laurent, being their first global ambassador in 59 years.https://www.wmagazine.com/story/blackpink-rose-new- global-face-of-saint-laurent/  Boutiques  Yves Saint Laurent men's wear in Florence, Italy, 2011 Designed by Slimane, the Paris flagship boutique opened in May 2013. The previous deep red and gold color scheme was replaced by a monochrome interior, with varying materials, including marble and nickel- plated bars. This concept was used in the renovated Beverly Hills boutique, and its new London boutique on Sloane Street, as well as new stores in the United States. In 2013, a men's store‚Äîa first for the brand‚Äîopened in San Francisco, a full-line store opened in New York City, in its SoHo neighborhood, and a full-line store opened in Chicago at the Waldorf Astoria on Rush Street, where private showings had been given since the Chicago store closed in 2010. Under Slimane Saint Laurent plans to continue to expand its presence in the United States, opening new stores in the resort locations of Bal Harbour, Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as a planned store for Washington, D.C.. International locations includes a strong presence in Europe, with boutiques ranging in location from Barcelona, Munich, Berlin, Warsaw, and Kiev, to Bologna, Rome, Moscow, Monte Carlo and Cannes. Locations in the Middle East and Africa include Beirut, Casablanca, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Kuwait City, and Jeddah. In Asia Saint Laurent boutiques can be found in Jakarta, Bangkok, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Macau, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The brand has a heavy presence in Japan with boutiques in Kyoto, Tokyo, and Osaka as well as outlet locations across the country. In China standalone boutiques are located in Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing.

The novel is a lightweight romantic fantasy. A contemporary reviewer, writing in an 1854 issue of the New Monthly Review, declared that he ‚Äúliked it least of all Disraeli‚Äôs works.‚Äù :Lord Byron and Shelley figure in its pages, under different names and different worldly circumstances from those in which they actually lived.

Michael Flavin‚Äôs Benjamin Disraeli: The Novel as a Political Discourse suggests that Venetia was largely a commercial endeavour for Disraeli, who was deep in debt at the time that he wrote it. In Byron and the Victorians, Andrew Elfenbein discusses Venetia in terms of Disraeli's presenting himself as \\"the moral, political and literary successor to Byron, by manipulating the representation of Byron's sexuality\\", making him straight instead of bisexual and portraying him as having steady but distant male friendships. He says the novel can best be described as \\"kooky\\" because of its confused and confusing portrayals of both Byron and Shelley, giving each traits and life circumstances actually possessed by the other.Andrew Elfenbein, Byron and the Victorians.

The struggle between the two armies became so protracted \\"that the whole face of the land was covered with the bodies of the dead.\\"Ether 14: 21 Nevertheless, Shiz continued to fight, having sworn to avenge the death of his brother. Shiz pursued Coriantumr to the seashore where their troops fought a three-day battle. Coriantumr's troops twice defeated the troops of Shiz, but in the third encounter, Shiz wounded Coriantumr severely, giving him many deep wounds. Coriantumr was \\"carried away as though he were dead,\\" but Shiz had lost so many people that he ordered his army not to pursue the rival army.Ether 14: 30-31 After two million of Coriantumr's people had been killed, Coriantumr offered his throne to Shiz in exchange for peace. Shiz responded that he would only stop the bloodshed if Coriantumr allowed Shiz to kill him. The two sides attacked each other once again, and the final battle was fought at the hill Ramah (Cumorah),Ether 15:5-6 where every Jaredite joined in the battle except for the prophet Ether.

Shiz fainted from the loss of blood, and Coriantumr cut off his head.Ether 15:29-30 The Book of Mormon concludes the story of Shiz's death at the hands of Coriantumr with the words: \\"And it came to pass that after he [Coriantumr] had smitten off the head of Shiz, that Shiz raised up on his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for breath, he died.\\"Ether 15:31 Apologetic response Concerning the description of Shiz's death, the Mormon Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research argues that, based on modern neuroanatomy, the account of Shiz's death is actually \\"a realistic touch\\" and represents \\"a phenomenon that went unrecognized in the medical literature of the modern era until 1898.

Put together by Johannes Smetius (1591-1651) and his son Johannes Smetius Junior (1636-1704), both clergy at Nijmegen, the collection was instrumental in settling the debate about the exact location of the Batavians. History of the collection Johannes Smetius Senior moved to Nijmegen in 1617 where his parents lived and worked as a preacher. Interested in history, he began collecting Roman antiquities which were frequently discovered in and around the city. In 1644 he published Oppidum Batavorum seu Noviomagum, in which he used his collection to argue that Tacitus' description of the Batavian fortress was Nijmegen. In 1678 Johannes Smetius Junior published a catalogue of the collection under the title Antiquitates Neomagenses. This book is currently on sale, recently translated to Dutch, under the title Nijmeegse Oudheden (Antiquities from Nijmegen). The two publications made the collection famous and its major importance in the scholarly debate about Roman activities in the Netherlands was recognized. The books also shed some light on the size of the collection, which encompassed over 10,000 Roman coins and about 4,500 other Roman antiquities. Eventually the collection was sold to Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine and moved to D√ºsseldorf. Only the few pieces that were donated to the city of Nijmegen are left of the collection, as the sold majority dispersed over time and its contents are now untraceable.

The station's first incarnation on air was short-lived, lasting only until October. Ambert Dail, the radio columnist for the Daily Press, said it had lasted \\"on faith and LPs\\" and that it had ended in an \\"Edsel-like burn\\". WYFI was back on the air by late November, in no small part thanks to having been sold to WBOF radio of Virginia Beach. The purchase was made official in early 1960, with WYFI selling for a mere $7,000. WBOF-WYFI was sold later in 1960 to Washington, D.C., attorney Temple Seay for $260,000. In 1961, WBOF and WYFI both affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System, giving the network one of its first separately programmed FM affiliates. =Seven years off the air= WBOF filed to sell WYFI in 1963 to five local businessmen for $53,100. The sale, however, was never closed. On February 28, 1964, WBOF and WYFI received permission to remain off the air, authorization that would be continuously extended for WYFI for years. Roy Marsh resigned from the Hampton Roads Educational Television Authority to become the receiver for Metro-WBOF, Inc., the licensee of the two radio stations. (He would be replaced in 1966 by Andre Evans.) The WBOF stations went up for auction in 1964. The winning bid for WYFI, at $36,000, came from Continental Broadcasting, owners of WRAP. (The AM station, by comparison, fetched $136,000.) Continental also owned four additional radio stations outside of Norfolk, and it would be an action involving one of them that would ultimately kill its chances at acquiring the station. In June 1965, the Federal Communications Commission designated the license renewal of Continental's WNJR in Newark, New Jersey for hearing, over a time-brokerage agreement case in which falsification and misrepresentations were involved. The next month, the FCC deferred action on the sale to Continental on the result of the Newark hearing. While a hearing examiner initially slapped WNJR with a short-term renewal, the FCC voted 4-1 in November 1968 to deny its renewal application altogether. =Return to the air and BBN operation= The summer of 1969 brought a new party to the long-running WYFI proceedings. On June 26, Christian Communications, Inc., filed an application to build a new radio station on WYFI's frequency. Christian Communications, headed by Lowell W. Davey, had previously attempted to buy another Norfolk FM outlet, WRVC. That November, receiver Evans filed to relocate the WYFI transmitter and increase its effective radiated power to 50,000 watts from the 11,500 it had used; the FCC initially approved the application, but set it aside when Christian Communications petitioned to deny the grant. Receiver Evans and Christian Communications ultimately reached a settlement agreement: in July 1970, Christian Communications agreed to buy WYFI, with the 1964 sale application to Continental and the 1969 facility change dismissed as part of the settlement. The new owners then were approved for their own grant to increase power to 50,000 watts. The facility's construction had its own challenges; none of the equipment ordered to put WYFI back on the air worked out of the box. After more than seven years of silence, WYFI returned to the air at 5 p.m. on October 2, 1971. It would be the first station in a series. In 1974, the newly renamed Bible Broadcasting Network acquired its second outlet, WHPE in High Point, North Carolina.

History The 1768 Act of Parliament which authorised the building of the Birmingham Canal to Wolverhampton included a lucrative branch to the coal mines of Wednesbury, which was completed the following year, allowing coal to be shipped cheaply to Birmingham. Between the two termini, there was a ridge of high ground at Smethwick, which was crossed by building a flight of six locks at Smethwick, and another six at Spon Lane. Both ends were at what became known as the Birmingham Level of above sea level, but the locks raised the level by to . When building of the Birmingham Canal main line continued towards Wolverhampton and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Aldersley Junction, Spon Lane Junction was formed half way down the Spon Lane flight of locks, at the Wolverhampton Level of . The canal was level to Wolverhampton, where it dropped through twenty locks (later increased by one) to reach the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The main line opened in September 1772. Water supply to the Smethwick summit was a problem, and in 1778, a Boulton and Watt pumping engine was installed at the junction, to pump water back up the top three locks of the flight to the summit. With the opening of the Broadwaters extension of the Wednesbury Canal, which served coal mines near Moxley, there was additional traffic through the junction and over the summit, and the building of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal threatened to make the situation worse. The company therefore decided to make the summit lower in 1787, and this was achieved in two stages. The first was a new cut lower than the original summit, which eliminated two locks at either end, and was completed on 2 July 1789. Spoil from the excavations was removed using the upper line. A second new cut was then made below this, to eliminate the third lock at each end, and the spoil was removed using the middle line. The canal had to be closed for 22 days to allow the ends of the new cut to be connected to the original channels, and for it to fill with water, but the new line was operational on 6 April 1790. Spon Lane Junction was now at the top of the three Spon Lane locks. The top lock has a split bridge, which allowed horses to cross the canal without having to disconnect the towing rope, which passed through the gap between the two halves of the bridge. This particular example is, however, a 1986 reconstruction. The remaining three locks at Smethwick were duplicated at the same time. The pumping engine at the junction now served no purpose and was removed. Chance's Glassworks 'seven storey' building Traffic on the system continued to expand, and in 1825 the engineer Thomas Telford was asked to construct a new main line. Like all of Telford's designs, this would use cuttings and embankments to follow a straight course across the landscape, and his new route reduced the length of the canal by to compared to James Brindley's contour canal. It intersected the Wednesbury Canal at Pudding Green Junction, and was widened and straightened between there and the bottom of Spon Lane Locks, where Bromford Junction was created. From the junction, a huge cutting created the fourth route to Smethwick Junction, in places up to deep. It passed under the Old Main Line close to Spon Lane Junction to reach its destination. Apart from three locks at Factory Junction, where it left the old main line, it was all built on the Birmingham Level. The old route, which included Spon Lane Junction, was retained. When the top three locks of the Spon Lane flight were no longer required, as a result of the lowering of the summit, they were simply filled with earth and abandoned. They were uncovered again briefly in July 1969 during the construction of the M5 motorway, but were destroyed to make way for the new road. Location The junction is on the Wolverhampton Level, at the top of the three locks that descend to Wednesbury. They are now known as the Spon Lane Locks Branch, and are some of the oldest unaltered locks in the country, as they are virtually unchanged since they were built by James Brindley. The junction and the top lock are now under an elevated section of the M5 motorway, and all three of the locks are grade II listed structures. From the junction to the top of Smethwick locks, the canal is level for The Old Main Line passes over the New Main Line on the Stewart Aqueduct. The two skew arches are elliptical in shape, and it is built in brick with sandstone dressings and cast iron railings. The Old Main Line continues on the level for to the top of the Wolverhampton flight of locks, meeting the New Main Line at Factory Junction after . The New Main Line to the east of Bromford Junction is also known as the Island Line.

It has a small cone shaped, slightly hairy rhizome about 1.18 inches (30mm) in diameter. The leaf blades have a base that tapers gradually, pale green in colour (reddish under intense light), 20+ inches (50+ cm) long and 3 inches (8 cm) broad, with a wavy margin on petioles of an equal length, and in appearance slightly translucent. A single bulb may produce up to forty leaves in good conditions. No floating leaves are formed. The yellow flowers are produced on one or two, and sometimes more, erect spikes. Origin It is distributed throughout central and northern Madagascar. In the wild, the plant is permanently submerged and grows in both still and moving waters and sunny and partially shaded environments.  Cultivation and uses  Aponogeton ulvaceus will tolerate most water conditions, but will thrive in slightly alkaline water conditions and a temperature of around 72 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C). Additional CO2 produces more luxuriant growth. It likes a bright position but will grow in partial shade. In an aquarium it makes a very good specimen plant. Use a fine brush to pollinate the flowers. In a sand/very fine gravel compost the seeds will germinate in about one to two weeks. The leaves are attractive to snails who can do a lot of damage to these plants in an aquarium. Perhaps dependent on origin and genetics some plants will go dormant in the winter and for several months can be kept at a lower temperature, others seem to keep growing. Many hybrids of this species are sold in the aquarium trade and the true form is probably quite rare. References * Rataj, Dr. Karel and Horeman, T.

History Horn's Mill was at the foot of Bullock's Lane. The mill ground corn, crushed oil seeds and ground bones for fertiliser. Production ceased in the late nineteenth century and the premises were sold to leather-dresser William Webb. Chamois leather was produced at first but later a glove making business was established. This closed in 1971. The site is now occupied by housing in Waterdale, Tanners Close and Glovers Close. The original mill was a watermill which was located on a cut from the upper section of the River Lea. The mill has long since been demolished, leaving only a set of sluice gates. Present The area is now populated by four main housing estates generally known as Pearson Avenue or 'the old estate', Hornsmill or 'the new estate', Tanners Crescent and Mandeville Road. There are two grocery shops - one houses a post office, a modern community centre, a children's park with some facilities for younger and older children and the Grade II listed Harts Horns pub which as of March 2015 has ceased trading as a public house and is now a contemporary Indian restaurant called Ginger Bar & Restaurant.Listed building details http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-461367-the-harts-horns- hertford-hertfordshire The Hornsmill Estate consists of Cecil Road, Brickendon Lane, Purkiss Road, Cranbourne Close, The Dell and Hornsmill Road.

Tank vs. vat leaching =Factors= Tank leaching is usually differentiated from vat leaching on the following factors: # In tank leaching the material is ground sufficiently fine to form a slurry or pulp, which can flow under gravity or when pumped. In vat leaching typically a coarser material is placed in the vat for leaching, this reduces the cost of size reduction; # Tanks are typically equipped with agitators, baffles, gas introduction equipment designed to maintain the solids in suspension in the slurry, and achieve leaching. Vats usually do not contain much internal equipment, except for agitators. # Tank leaching is typically continuous, while vat leaching is operated in a batch fashion, this is not always the case, and commercial processes using continuous vat leaching have been tested; # Typically the retention time required for vat leaching is more than that for tank leaching to achieve the same percentage of recovery of the valuable material being leached; In a tank leach the slurry is moved, while in a vat leach the solids remain in the vat, and solution is moved. =Processes= Tank and vat leaching involves placing ore, usually after size reduction and classification, into large tanks or vats at ambient operating conditions containing a leaching solution and allowing the valuable material to leach from the ore into solution. In tank leaching the ground, classified solids are already mixed with water to form a slurry or pulp, and this is pumped into the tanks. Leaching reagents are added to the tanks to achieve the leaching reaction. In a continuous system the slurry will then either overflow from one tank to the next, or be pumped to the next tank. Ultimately the ‚Äúpregnant‚Äù solution is separated from the slurry using some form of liquid/solid separation process, and the solution passes on to the next phase of recovery. In vat leaching the solids are loaded into the vat, once full the vat is flooded with a leaching solution. The solution drains from the tank, and is either recycled back into the vat or is pumped to the next step of the recovery process. . Vat leach units are rectangular containers (drums, barrels, tanks or vats), usually very big and made of wood or concrete, lined with material resistant to the leaching media. The treated ore is usually coarse. The vats are usually run sequentially to maximize the contact time between the ore and the reagent. In such a series the leachate collected from one container is added to another vat with fresher ore As mentioned previously tanks are equipped with agitators to keep the solids in suspension in the vats and improve the solid to liquid to gas contact. Agitation is further assisted by the use of tank baffles to increase the efficiency of agitation and prevent centrifuging of slurries in circular tanks... Extraction efficiency factors Aside from chemical requirements several key factors influence extraction efficiency: * Retention time - refers to the time spent in the leaching system by the solids. This is calculated as the total volumetric capacity of the leach tank/s divided by the volumetric throughput of the solid/liquid slurry. Retention time is commonly measured in hours for precious metals recovery. A sequence of leach tanks is referred to as a leach \\"train\\", and retention time is measured considering the total volume of the leach train. The desired retention time is determined during the testing phase, and the system is then designed to achieve this. * Size - The ore must be ground to a size that exposes the desired mineral to the leaching agent (referred to as ‚Äúliberation‚Äù), and in tank leaching this must be a size that can be suspended by the agitator. In vat leaching this is the size that is the most economically viable, where the recovery achieved as ore is ground finer is balanced against the increased cost of processing the material. * Slurry density - The slurry density (percent solids) determines retention time. The settling rate and viscosity of the slurry are functions of the slurry density. The viscosity, in turn, controls the gas mass transfer and the leaching rate. * Numbers of tanks - Agitated tank leach circuits are typically designed with no less than four tanks and preferably more to prevent short- circuiting of the slurry through the tanks. * Dissolved gas - Gas is often injected below the agitator or into the vat to obtain the desired dissolved gas levels ‚Äì typically oxygen, in some base metal plants sulphur dioxide may be required. * Reagents - Adding and maintaining the appropriate amount of reagents throughout the leach circuit is critical to a successful operation. Adding insufficient quantities of reagents reduces the metal recovery but adding excess reagents increases the operating costs without recovering enough additional metal to cover the cost ‚Ä¢of the reagents. The tank leaching method is commonly used to extract gold and silver from ore, such as with the Sepro Leach Reactor.

Originally fitted out for blockade duty, the schooner first carried four 32-pounders, but, before she commissioned, she was selected for service in Comdr. David D. Porter's mortar flotilla, and two of her cannon were removed to make room for a 13-inch mortar and two 12-pounder rifles.  Sent south to the Mississippi delta  Towed by tugs Burlech and T.

They reached Ship Island, Mississippi, on 13 March and 5 days later entered the Mississippi River over the bar at Pass a l'Outre. Flag Officer David G. Farragut, the commander of the Union expedition against New Orleans, Louisiana, kept his smaller ships busy during the following weeks with training and preparations for the coming attack, while he labored to get his deep draft steamers over the bar and into the river.  The attack on Fort Jackson  With the 3d Division of the Flotilla, Racer was towed upstream on the afternoon of 17 April by and anchored near the left bank of the river under shelter of dense foliage. The crew then trimmed her masts and rigging with branches to camouflage the ship. Meanwhile, the Confederates set blazing fire rafts adrift to float downstream among the Union warships. About midmorning the next day, Racer and her sister schooner opened fire on Fort Jackson which, with Fort St. Philip, protected New Orleans from attack from the sea. The schooner kept up the bombardment intermittently for 6 days. Soon after midnight on the 24th, they increased their fire on the forts while Farragut made final preparations to race past the southern guns. They maintained their rapid fire cannonade until the Union steam warships were safely past the southern forts and moving on New Orleans to begin the Union conquest of the lower Mississippi valley, which ultimately bisected the Confederacy and foredoomed its collapse.  The fall of Forts Jackson and St. Philip  After New Orleans and the southern forts fell, Porter and his flotilla retired down the Mississippi and proceeded via Ship Island to Pensacola, Florida. However, they soon returned to the Mississippi to support Farragut's expedition up the river and reached sight of Vicksburg, Mississippi, 20 June. The schooners shelled Confederate batteries as Farragut raced past the fortress to meet Flag Officer Davis' Western Flotilla and again, a fortnight later, when he dashed back down.  East Coast operations  On 9 July orders arrived for Porter to return to the U.S. East Coast with a dozen schooners. Racer reached Norfolk, Virginia, late in the month and following repairs at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, joined the Potomac Flotilla in September. For the next year, she operated on the Potomac and the Rappahannock rivers. On 18 July 1863, she joined and in driving off Confederate troops attacking ship George Peabody, aground at Mathias Point, Virginia. Shortly thereafter, Racer was transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and participated in operations against Charleston, South Carolina.  Post-war decommissioning and sale  After the war ended, Racer was decommissioned at New York 2 September and was sold at auction there 27 September 1865 to a Mr. White for $9500.

WTJZ is owned and operated by Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation. History =WHYU and WACH= The Eastern Broadcasting Corporation, owners of WCNS in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, received in April 1947 a construction permit for a new daytime-only radio station on 1270 kHz in Newport News, with call letters WHYU. The new station went on air September 27, 1947 as an independent local station; a year later, the Elizabeth City-based ownership sold WHYU for $60,000, citing the fact that they could not devote the necessary time or attention to its operation. In 1951, WHYU opened a studio in Hilton Village. WHYU's main studios were located at 114 24th Street, a former annex of the Hotel Warwick. Eastern's biggest venture in its ownership of the station, however, came in the early 1950s, when the station applied for UHF channel 33 in Newport News. WACH-TV signed on the air for the first time on October 13, 1953. WACH-TV temporarily suspended operations on March 27, 1954, at which time the radio station also took on the WACH call letters. WACH-TV resumed operations later in 1954 and went off the air for the second time in 1955. However, the damage was done. WACH radio suspended operations on February 1, 1956, and a bankruptcy receiver was appointed. =WYOU= Out of bankruptcy, WACH and its accompanying TV permit (despite remaining dark) were sold to the United Broadcasting Company of Eastern Virginia, owned by Richard Eaton, for $54,500 in 1956. The radio station returned to air as WYOU after being granted the new call letters on July 30, 1956. WYOU's rhythm and blues format was the first stop in a long and noteworthy radio career. Under the name \\"Daddy Jules\\", a young Wolfman Jack became the station's star personality; he invited local teens to dance and make requests, which drew lines of 100 or more youth outside the studios and sent the ratings soaring. =WTID and WOKT= In 1960, Eaton sold WYOU, now under new WTID call letters adopted on September 15, 1960, to Twelve Seventy, Inc., headed by Max Reznick, for $130,000. The new WTID was an easy listening station; the former \\"Daddy Jules\\" became \\"Roger Gordon\\", but the format was not a fit for Wolfman Jack, who in a 1994 interview called the new ownership a \\"jerk\\" for changing the format and would leave in 1962 for a station in Shreveport, Louisiana. In December 1963, Twelve Seventy declared bankruptcy, the second in station history. WTID's 1964 license renewal application would only cloud matters further. In May 1965, the Federal Communications Commission designated the application for hearing, refusing the court-appointed trustee's bid to grant the renewal petition to pay off debtors, and in October, an FCC hearing examiner recommended the renewal application be denied. Issues in the hearing included an undisclosed investor, the Mutual Security Savings and Loan Association, and an undisclosed 1963 transfer of control to George Dail. However, in April 1966, the FCC granted the renewal and the assignment of the WTID license to Big T Corporation. The owners of Big T were advertising agency head Alvin Epstein, air personality Milton Q. Ford, and Charleston, South Carolina, radio station owner Barry Winton; the station was to continue with its country format. Within months, Epstein bought Winton's stake; between 1967 and 1971, Norman Berger and Hyman Tash acquired control. The Big T era was also notable for the 1967 launch of sister station WTID-FM 104.5, which continued WTID's country format after sunset. Big T changed its name in 1972 to Musicradio Broadcasting Corporation. In 1975, Musicradio sold WTID-AM-FM to Bay Cities Communications Corporation for $700,000. On March 14, 1977, the station changed its call letters to WOKT. During this time, Bay Cities had pending an application to relocate the station's transmitter and add nighttime service with 1,000 watts, which was granted in 1980. =Jazz era= In 1979, WOKT became WTJZ with a jazz format. Low ratings prompted the station to change to oldies in 1982, with WGH-FM DJ Roger Clark coming to WTJZ as station manager; the station continued to retain a number of jazz tracks in its playlist. During this time, WTJZ and the FM station (known as WQRK and finally WNVZ) were sold to Abell Communications in 1982 and S&F; Communications in 1985. Additionally, the station carried Tidewater Tides minor league baseball in 1984. The station returned to jazz in 1986 following its sale to the Broadcasting Corporation of Virginia, formed by three local entrepreneurs who bought the AM station from S&F; for $500,000. =Religious programming= Logo as \\"Joy 1270 AM\\" prior to the 2017 relaunch as Praise By 1987, however, WTJZ had flipped to gospel, beginning more than 30 years of religious and African American-oriented programming. In addition to gospel music, the station carried National Black Network newscasts and sponsored an NAACP membership drive in 1988. Broadcasting Corporation of Virginia entered bankruptcy and sold the station to Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corporation for $380,000 in 1998. In 2003, WTJZ almost exited the format when it was announced that the station would become \\"Radio Tropical\\", the first full-time Spanish-language radio station in Hampton Roads, on March 17. That date came and went without a change; in May, the Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Temple stepped in to lease the station, retaining the gospel format‚Äîas well as the broadcasts of its church services, which had aired on 1270 AM since 1987. The station aired its local programming as well as satellite-delivered gospel service \\"The Light\\" after 5 p.m. In addition to its religious shows, WTJZ was the home at the time of Richmond Spiders college and Carolina Panthers NFL football, as well as broadcasts of some high school sporting events and a fishing show. On January 3, 2017, WTJZ rebranded as \\"Praise 104.9\\" (simulcasting on FM translator W285FM 104.9 FM Hampton). The change coincided with new management.

WPCE is owned and operated by the Christian Broadcasting Corporation. History =Early years= The Commonwealth Broadcasting Corporation obtained the construction permit for a new daytime- only radio station on 1590 kHz in Portsmouth on July 25, 1946. Originally authorized as WCKA, the call letters were changed to WLOW before signing on. The station made several attempts to change frequency, finally succeeding when the FCC allowed the station to move to 1410 kHz in 1949 and gaining approval to broadcast at night with a further move to 1400 the next year. Mark Scott, a sportscaster for the station, went on to broadcast Hollywood Stars Pacific Coast League games. The station also owned the short-lived Norfolk UHF television station WTOV-TV (channel 27). In 1955, after its first WTOV-TV experience, WLOW wanted to make a second go-around at television, this time on the VHF band; it asked the FCC to move channel 13 from New Bern, North Carolina, to Princess Anne. (The commission denied the appeal in January 1956.) That same year, it was sold to a group that had also been burned by UHF television, the Winston-Salem Broadcasting Company, owner of WTOB radio and television in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for $212,500. Winston-Salem sold the station to the James Broadcasting Company two years later, Tim Elliot, the owner of station WICE at Providence, Rhode Island, acquired WLOW for the same price four years later and changed the call letters to WHIH on July 1. Daytime power was increased to 1,000 watts the next year. WHIH went bankrupt in 1964 and was assigned to trustees; Speidel Broadcasting Company of Virginia purchased the station out of bankruptcy. Speidel specialized in radio stations for the Black community, and the new acquisition adopted the same R&B; format that characterized the chain. The station ran one promotion that attracted unexpected results. In 1967, WHIH ran a competition to determine which local school had the most spirit by receiving slips of paper with the schools' names written on them. It expected 15,000 total entries, but in the end, competition among the 20 participating schools was so high that the station rented an empty warehouse to store the nearly 180 million total votes and asked students to count their own submissions. The winner was George Washington Carver High with 54,272,025 votes. Baron Broadcasting acquired WHIH in 1971. Effective June 11, the call letters were changed to WWOC‚Äîrepresenting \\"We Will Overcome\\"‚Äîwith the station maintaining a soul format. However, a year later, Baron flipped WWOC to a primarily contemporary music format. That did not last long, either, as WWOC changed to country on April 15, 1973. =WPCE= In October 1974, Metro Communications Corporation (later Willis Broadcasting Corporation), owned by Levi Willis, struck separate deals to acquire WWOC and WOWI (102.9 FM); the AM station fetched $365,000. The deal was a watershed moment for radio ownership in Hampton Roads, as WWOC and WOWI became the first two Black-owned stations in the market, competing against white-owned but African American-oriented WRAP. The call letters of WWOC were changed to WPCE on July 1, 1975, and the station initially converted to an R&B; format before flipping to gospel by 1977. The late 1970s brought legal peril to the Willis operation. In 1977, after a months-long investigation, the FCC moved to designate both stations' license renewals for hearing. Key in the case were three allegations: one that the station's sales manager in 1975 and 1976 used coercion and threats of boycotts to secure advertising from Coca-Cola, Sears and a Norfolk tire shop; another about the airing of misleading advertising and information about illegal lotteries; and another alleging Willis had taken over station WBLU at Salem. The case was ended in 1982 when an administrative law judge recommended a $10,000 fine to Willis and the renewal of its licenses. Willis sold WOWI in 1989; by this time, what had started with the two Hampton Roads stations had grown into a major radio chain owning 22 stations from Arkansas to Pennsylvania. Many of the stations, including WPCE, carried a satellite-fed gospel format that originated at Willis's WWCA in Gary, Indiana, and included Willis's long-running Crusade for Christ program. The Willis group had grown to 40 outlets by the early 2000s, but Levi Willis's failing health and a series of unpaid debts to the Internal Revenue Service caused financial problems for the chain. In 1997, the company paid more than $700,000 to settle claims of unpaid royalties for songs played on its stations. In 2003, the city of Norfolk seized the Willis Broadcasting Corporation headquarters after the company failed to pay $150,000 of property taxes over a five-year period. Willis died in 2009. WPCE, WGPL (1350 AM), and WBXB (100.1 FM) in Edenton, North Carolina, are the last stations owned by the former Willis group, which restructured in 2018 and became known as the Christian Broadcasting Corporation (no relation to the Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network).

After growing up in Texas, Prosser was educated at Prairie View Normal College, the University of Colorado and the University of Cincinnati. She was killed in a car accident a short time after earning her doctorate. Early life Prosser was born to Samuel Andrew and Veola Hamilton Beverly in Yoakum, Texas on December 30, 1897. Her mother was a homemaker and her father was a waiter. Prosser was the eldest daughter and the second of eleven children. During her youth, there were few educational opportunities for African-Americans, and her family moved many times to seek the best education they could find for their children. To contribute to the household, Prosser started a college fund to support her younger siblings' education. Of the eleven children, all graduated from high school and six went on to earn college degrees.Warren, W. (1999). Black women scientists in the United States. Bloomington: Indiana Press. Prosser graduated as valedictorian from Yoakum Colored High School in 1912 and then received a degree in teacher training from Prairie View Normal College (now Prairie View A&M; University), where she was also valedictorian. Education and career She returned to Yoakum and taught for a short time at their segregated schools. Then, Prosser became an assistant principal at Clayton Industrial School in Manor, Texas, before accepting a more long-term position at Anderson High School. Throughout her time at Anderson, she taught English and coached for the Interscholastic League, an organization that sponsored events for Black high school students throughout the state.Hays, D.M. (1996). The race, ethnicity, and gender issues at the University of Colorado: 1876-1995. Unpublished paper. At Anderson High School, she taught English and coached a girls team for spelling competitions. During this period, Prosser met and married Allen Rufus Prosser, who worked as an elevator operator at a department store in Austin, and the two were married in 1916. Prosser received several awards and embraced the opportunity to continue her education. She went on to receive a master's degree in educational psychology from the University of Colorado. At Colorado, Prosser took several courses that were particularly relevant to her master's thesis whose subject areas include mental tests, tests and measurement, and research methods. Her thesis, \\"The Comparative Reliability of Objective Tests in English Grammar\\", examined four kinds of English grammar tests (using the standards proposed by the National Education Association).Benjamin Jr., L. T., Henry, K. D., & McMahon, L. R. (2005). Inez Beverly Prosser and the education of African Americans. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 41(1), 43-62.. Her four test types included true-false, multiple choice, completion, and matching questions. All tests covered the same subject areas and difficulty levels as well as comparable numbers of factual and reasoning questions. Upon receiving her master's degree, Prosser left Anderson High School in 1927 to accept a position as a faculty member at Tillotson College, a Black college in Austin. At Tillotson, she not only displayed her teaching and leadership skills but truly dedicated herself to the educational and psychological development of Black students. At Tillotson, she was given the opportunity to organize a series of lectures from 1929 to 1930, which even featured a lecture by George Washington Carver. Overall, Prosser was at Tillotson College from 1921 to 1930, serving as \\"Dean, Registrar and Professor of Education. [6] pg. 10 Her influences extended well beyond the classroom walls or administrative offices. Prosser was eventually transferred to another dual teaching and administrative position at Tougaloo College in Tougaloo, Mississippi. Even as Dean and Registrar of Tougaloo College, Prosser accepted the position as Principal of Tougaloo High School. Her career took an important turn when she applied for and was awarded aid from the General Education Board (established by John D. Rockefeller in 1902). In her application, she noted, \\"I am interested in that type of research which will lead to better teaching in elementary and high schools\\". She received $1,000 to apply towards another year of graduate studies. finally, she became one of the first Black women to earn a PhD in psychology, graduating from the University of Cincinnati in 1933.Winegarten, R. (1996). Black Texan women: 150 years of trial and triumph. Austin: University of Texas Press. Warren states that, \\"Prosser was mentored closely by her Doctoral adviser and developed a close friendship with them\\" She held positions at many schools, and not only taught, but also became assistant principal. Although racial discrimination was rampant, Prosser continued to accept minimal wages for work that rivaled or exceeded that of her white colleagues. In Prosser's case, according to Warren, \\"Although her dissertation research was in psychology, her doctoral mentor and other members of her committee were psychologists, and much of her coursework was in psychology, she is often denied her well-deserved title of psychologist.\\" Prosser died in a car accident in 1934. Dissertation and other works Prosser arrived at the University of Cincinnati as a candidate for a PhD in educational psychology in 1931. She arrived at a time when there was a research program that \\"focused on African Americans in different school environments\\". The general consensus in the department at this time was that \\"all-black schools with black teachers could best provide the skills black students needed to survive in a society where most faced limited opportunities‚Ä¶segregated schools, by insulating black students from white abuse, were crucial to the formation of black identity and could become unifying community centers. Prosser's dissertation, The Non-Academic Development of Negro Children in Mixed and Segregated Schools, became an important text for issues relating to education, reform, social development, racial identity, and other prominent topics related to segregation.Guthrie, R. V. (1976). Even the rat was white: A historical view of psychology. New York: Harper & Row. It was a \\"companion study\\" to Mary Crowley's 1931 dissertation, \\"A Comparison of the Academic Achievement of Cincinnati Negroes in Segregated and Mixed Schools\\" Prosser's interest in the topic \\"grew out of a desire to determine objectively, so far as possible, the degree of truth in the often repeated statement that the Negro child develops superior character traits, more racial self-respect, and a greater concomitants of a well-rounded education when he is placed under the direction of Negro teachers during his formative years\\".Prosser, I. B. (1933). On-academic development of Negro children in mixed and segregated schools. Unpublished doctoral dissertation. University of Cincinnati. She took Crowley's research a step further by considering the demographics of the student body in the schools as well. The purpose was: (1) to measure vocational interests, leisure interests, social participation, emotional or neurotic tendencies, social distance, ascendancy-submission, overstatement, introversion-extraversion, and general personality adjustment‚Ä¶, (2) to ascertain the difference, if any, that exists in these traits, and (3) to determine whether one of the other of these schools is better fostering growth in personality in so far as it can be determined by the available techniques. Prosser wanted to see if there was a difference between black students in integrated schools and in segregated schools. Her dissertation sought to answer seven main questions. Prosser measured the following questions by giving students surveys on personality and character traits; the first question was what are the social and cultural backgrounds of the children in the two groups? Second, what are the occupational and activity interests of the two groups? Third, to what extent do black children participate in after school activities? Fourth, what racial attitudes are each group exhibiting? Fifth, what are the emotional responses of the two groups towards being discriminated against? Sixth, what is the effect of the school type on the children's personality? Lastly, to what degree is aggressiveness and submission fostered in the two groups (1933)? In her dissertation, Prosser argues that racial injustices and feelings of isolation have damaging effects on the psyche of Black children. The effects are even more detrimental with the standards of living as it applies to socioeconomic status. Given that her sample size was small (64 students), Prosser refrained from making absolute suggestions. She argued that school selection should be based on the student's personality, as some do well in integrated schools while others benefit from segregated schools. She believed that most Black students receive a more balanced curriculum, affection, support, and family-school consistency in segregated schools. She also noted that segregated schools not only provided job opportunities, but also \\"a more nurturing environment\\" for Black teachers as well as students. Legacy Prosser was one of the key figures in the debate on how to best educate Black students. Arguments made in her dissertation were used in the 1920s and 1930s in the debate about school segregation. Her dissertation \\"examined personality differences in black children attending either voluntarily segregated or integrated schools and concluded that black children were better served in segregated schools\\" As a Black female psychologists, Prosser's voice was crucial during her time and now because the voices and this histories of Black Psychology and Black Psychologist has been absent from the narratives of mainstream American psychology. Although her dissertation research remains unpublished, her work appropriated by other researchers were used in the debated leading up to the Brown v. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court ruling of 1954, which argues that segregated schools were inherently unequal, thereby mandating integration in the nations public schools. Her works on the educational and identity development of Black students were not only influenced by her teaching and administrative experience, but by her only experiences at a \\"colored\\" school in Texas. While Prosser is frequently referred to as the first African- American woman to earn a PhD in Psychology, others believe that Ruth Winifred Howard (1900‚Äì1997) was the first. Those who argue that Howard, earning PhD at the University of Minnesota in 1934, is the first African-American woman to earn a PhD, hold the view that a psychologist is someone who earned the degree within a psychology department. In Prosser's case, although her \\"dissertation research was in psychology, her doctoral mentor and other members of her committee were psychologists, and much of her coursework was in psychology\\" she is often denied the title. Prosser posed a powerful argument regarding the effects of racial inequality on the mental health of African-American children. In her dissertation, she discussed optional education avenues, exploring reasons for providing children the opportunity to be educated according to their ability, not their socioeconomic status. She cited examples of psychological stress in students incurred as a result of racial discrepancies and racial isolation. Prosser voiced her support for segregated schools and the reasons they benefited students and staff, and also provided reasons for which this segregation was detrimental to all students and individuals involved. During the debates over school segregation in the 1920s, many of her arguments were cited. She was a critical voice for the African- American community at a time when women academics were scarce. Prosser's contributions to the improvement of education for all students can be felt in many policies still being used throughout the teaching community today. In 1934, she was killed in an automobile accident near Shreveport, Louisiana.

It is approximately 140 km north-west of Perth. The name mainly refers to the mainland settlement but also refers to a long wedge shaped island located just south of \\"the point\\". The settlement of Grey is about north-west. Both are within the Shire of Dandaragan. The island occupies an area and is situated from the mainland. The island has a maximum elevation of . It lies within the Turquoise Coast islands nature reserve group, a chain of 40 islands spread over a distance of from north to south. Wedge Island was named after government surveyor Charles Wedge, in 1875 by Staff-Commander William Edwin Archdeacon R.N., who was in charge of the Admiralty survey of the coast of Western Australia. The settlement is now home to approximately 350 beach shacks on unvested land that are used by crayfishermen and holiday-goers. A new sealed road, Indian Ocean Drive was opened in September 2010 which provides 2WD access to Wedge. There are claims that this has changed the local environment. The road, intended to promote tourism is well known for a number of serious vehicle crashes since it opened. Wedge can also be accessed in a 4WD vehicle, via the beach if the tide is out. The beach is very soft during summer and many vehicles become bogged or are swept into the water. There is no access at any time through the military range. Trespassers face large fines and possible loss of their vehicle if caught. Wedge is often quiet during the cooler months but during major public holidays such as Christmas, New Year's Day and Australia Day there are people in nearly every shack. Camping in the area is now officially prohibited. However it has been estimated that 14,000 individuals may use the shacks at Wedge and Grey. There are no shops, mains electricity nor running water, and generators are common. Activities include four wheel driving, sand boarding, surfing and kitesurfing, fishing, swimming and snorkeling. Motorbike riding has been banned in the area surrounding Wedge Island after many accidents resulted in people needing to be air lifted to get medical attention. The ranger now hands out fines to those caught using unlicensed vehicles in the vicinity, or leaving rubbish there. A man was fatally stabbed during a beach party on the northern side of Wedge in December 2013, after a brawl broke out. The New Year's Eve party involved more than 600 people. The WA Government has considered the removal of the shacks on Wedge in line with government policy. In March 2010, the Minister for the Environment Donna Faragher announced that she would not be seeking an end to the leases at Wedge and Grey until compromise options were considered by government. In April 2011, a WA Legislative Council Standing Committee found that coastal shacks should be removed to protect the environment from \\"unplanned growth\\". The shack leases were due to expire on 30 June 2011 but the Wedge community won a one-year renewal for all occupied facilities. Wedge and Grey are in an area subject to summer bushfires and visitors in beach shacks are sometimes asked to relocate.

It was for people migrating from Pakistan at the time of the partition of India and Pakistan, mainly Kutchi language speaking migrants. The 1950s saw an influx of other communities including the Maheshwari Meghwal Samaj people and the Regar community who migrated from Rajasthan and other parts of India, whose main occupation was shoe manufacturing. 1%of the occupants of the Thakkar Bapa colony were from the Kutchi and Maheshwari Meghwar community with 99% Marwari people who had came along with them. In the late 1970s there was further migration, including people from the Jeenagar community from Rajasthan and Punjab. Their sole occupation was also the manufacturing of shoes.

Work started on the channel in 1947 following major flooding and it was fully operational by 1976. The channel incorporates existing watercourses, lakes, and new channels. Water from the channel feeds the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain.  Design  Flood defences are rated according to the probability that a particular level of flood water will be exceeded at least once in a specific period, so a 100-year flood represents a level that would only be expected to occur once in 100 years. This is often known as 1 per cent protection. The level of flooding in 1947 was estimated to be a 1.4 per cent occurrence, and the flood channel, when it was first designed, was built to cope with this level of flooding. Since it was completed in 1976, there have been no major flood events in the Lea Valley, although there have been three occasions when the river system was full virtually to its capacity: in 1987, 1993 and 2000. Since its completion, the level of protection afforded by the structure has declined, so that in some areas it offers 2 per cent protection, and in some, only 5 per cent protection. The Environment Agency published a strategic environmental assessment in 2008, which looked at ways to maintain the flood defences in the Lea Valley.

It flows through Hardmead Lock and Stanstead Lock, which have had automatic sluice gates installed to cope with high water levels. At Feildes Weir a parallel channel has been constructed. The channel then skirts the Glen Faba Lake and passes under Dobbs Weir Road before entering the North Lagoon of the Nazeing Meads lake complex and leaving at the South Lagoon at Nazeing Weir. Continuing under Nazeing Road (B194), the channel flows through the River Lee Country Park at Holyfield Lake and out through Holyfield Weir. Flowing under Stubbins Hall Lane, it merges with the old River Lea at Fishers Green. After skirting Seventy Acres Lake and then Hooks Marsh Lake, the channel is incorporated into the Horsemill Stream, also known as Waltons Walk. The water forms a natural boundary for the Royal Gunpowder Mills as it passes through the mechanically controlled radial gates of the David Stoker sluice near Waltham Abbey. Now flowing parallel with the Lee Navigation, and only yards apart, the channel flows firstly under the A121 road and through Rammey Marsh Sluice - a set of three computer-controlled vertical lift sluice gates and then under the M25 motorway to be joined by Cobbins Brook before flowing through Newman's Sluice ‚Äì a set of four computer-controlled vertical lift sluice gates. = Greater London = The confluence of the River Lee Flood Relief Channel in foreground with the River Lea to become the River Lee Diversion below Enfield Island Village before flowing around the eastern perimeter of the King George V Reservoir The channel crosses Rammey Marsh to form the eastern boundary of the former Royal Small Arms Factory, which is now a housing development called Enfield Island Village.

The village has a population of 350. History The history of the village dates back to the 13th century, when it was located on the border of Bohemia and Silesia. The castle, constructed in 1297, served as a stronghold for knights. The remains of the former medieval stronghold are still intact, most notably, a rectangular stone keep (tower) on the western side. The initial purpose of the castle was to defend the Duchy of ≈öwidnica and Jawor. Subsequently, in the 14th century, the building changed its architectural character and purpose to serve as a manor house for wealthy nobles. Ruling aristocratic clans, like the German Rechenberg Family, greatly expanded the structure and adapted it to modern use. In the 19th century, the complex was restructured and redesigned once again. The palatial-styled fairy tale castle was located alongside a large, 80 hectare English garden. Before 1945, the castle was in eastern Nazi Germany. After World War II it was confiscated by the Polish state as it became part of Poland. In Kliczk√≥w, Prince Friedrich of Solms-Baruth was responsible for creating, beside the traditional family mausoleum, a cemetery for his most beloved horses and pets. Nowadays, there are only two surviving tombstones from at least a dozen that once stood in the graveyard. The overall Gothic and Renaissance Revival style of the castle make it a unique architectural gem in the region. The castle itself is a popular tourist spot in Lower Silesia.

She is part of the cast who appear in all Uuno Turhapuro films and TV series. The exception being Uuno Turhapuron veli, where the main character Uuno Turhapuro played by Vesa-Matti Loiri did not appear. Uuno debuted in 1973 in a sketch on the Spede Show, as half of a still nameless couple who had a premature argument about how to use their lottery money. (This sketch was recycled in the film Rautakauppias Uuno Turhapuro - presidentin v√§vy.) Elisabeth Turhapuro is only daughter of Councillor Tuura, the richest man in Finland, and the sharp, fiery and snapping wife of Uuno who has no sense of humor and often gets into arguments with him.  Marriage  As soon as Uuno and Elizabeth were married their marriage ran into trouble. However, although Elisabeth has, in many of her films, threatened her husband with divorce, she has always forgiven him his flaws and defects and the couple has remained married. Her husband, Uuno, believes that she is \\"withered\\", and will flirt with other women, which is often the reason for their marital disputes. The real reason Uuno married Elizabeth is because her father, Councillor Tuura, is the richest man in Finland and Uuno wants to inherit his wealth when he dies. Marjatta Raita speculated in an interview that the reason why Uuno and Elisabeth stay together has to do with what happens in the bedroom. Elisabeth can sometimes be very violent when upset with Uuno who usually brushes her remarks with an odd explanation which most of the time, in its own odd way, makes sense, leading Elisabeth baffled and unmotivated to continue the argument.

It forms part of an interrelated programme of legislation introduced by Lord Chancellor Lord Birkenhead between 1922 and 1925. The programme was intended to modernise the English law of real property. The Act deals principally with the transfer of freehold or leasehold land by deed. The LPA 1925, as amended, provides the core of English land law, particularly as regards many aspects of freehold land which is itself an important consideration in all other types of interest in land. Background The keynote policy of the act was to reduce the number of legal estates to two ‚Äì freehold and leasehold ‚Äì and generally to make the transfer of interests in land easier for purchasers. Other policies were to regulate mortgages and as to leases, to regulate mainly their assignment, and to tackle some of the lacunae, ambiguities and shortcomings in the law of property. Innovations included the default creation of easements under section 62 to reduce unintended denial of access, and statutory enlargement under section 153 (applications to convert very long leasehold to freeholds, where no rent has been paid or demanded for a long period of time). The Act followed a series of land law and policy reforms that had been begun by the Liberal government starting in 1906. This is how one American legal scholar, Morris Raphael Cohen, described it: Provisions =Part I ‚Äì General principles as to legal estates, equitable interests and powers= =Part II ‚Äì Contracts, conveyances and other instruments= Section 70 of the 1925 Act should be considered in conjunction with schedules 1 and 3 when considering interests that override, most notably that to be in receipts of rents and profits is no longer an overriding interest. Section 84 of the Act sets out the powers of an appointed authority to alter or remove restrictive covenants on property deeds. This power was later transferred to the Lands Tribunal by the Law of Property Act 1969, and subsequently to the Upper Tribunal by the Transfer of Tribunal Functions (Lands Tribunal and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2009. =Part III ‚Äì Mortgages, rentcharges, and powers of attorney= =Part IV ‚Äì Equitable interests and things in action= =Part V ‚Äì Leases and tenancies= =Part VI ‚Äì Powers= =Part VII ‚Äì Perpetuities and accumulations= =Part VIII ‚Äì Married women and lunatics= =Part IX ‚Äì Voidable dispositions= These sections govern fraud; s.172 was repealed (subject to non-application to then- pending bankruptcies) by the Insolvency Act 1985. *s.173 Every voluntary disposition of land (the main example is a gift) made with intent to defraud a later buyer is voidable at the instance of that buyer. And no such disposition shall be deemed to have been made with intent to defraud by reason only that a subsequent conveyance for valuable consideration was made, if such subsequent conveyance was made after 28 June 1893. *s.174 No acquisition made in good faith, without fraud or unfair dealing, of any reversionary (landlord's or future) interest in real or personal property, for money or money's worth, shall be liable to be opened or set aside merely on the ground of under value. In this subsection \\"reversionary interest\\" includes an expectancy or possibility. This expressly does not affect the jurisdiction of the court to set aside or modify unconscionable bargains. =Part X ‚Äì Wills and probate= =Part XI ‚Äì Miscellaneous= *Section 184 states that in cases of simultaneous death (where there is no evidence as to who lived longer), the deaths will be assumed to have occurred in order of age, oldest first.

Car features a regular group test under the 'Giant Test' name, which was originally developed by the magazine in the 1970s. It also features 'newcomer' first drives of new cars, interviews with significant figures in the motor industry and other features. History Car (UK), September 2002 The magazine was launched in 1962 as Small Car and Mini Owner incorporating Sporting Driver . It was renamed as Car in 1965. In the 1960s Car pioneered the 'Car of The Year' (COTY) competition that was subsequently decided by motoring journalists on a Europe wide basis. In the 1970s and 1980s Car was far ahead of other motoring magazines for the quality and depth of its writing, artwork and photography. Significant contributors during the magazine's heyday included Henry N. Manney III, Douglas Blain, George Bishop, L. J. K. Setright, Ronald Barker, Mel Nichols, Steve Cropley, Russell Bulgin, Philip Llewellin, James May, Alexei Sayle and Rowan Atkinson. L. J. K. Setright in many insightful series of articles, linked the development and history of the motor car to its social, technological and historical contexts. Car was also renowned for its 'scoop' photos and drawings and took delight in the irritation it caused to car manufacturers by revealing significant new models ahead of time. Car regularly featured the spy shots of Hans G. Lehmann, featuring his work with its own image-stamp emblazoned with the words Hans G. Lehmann - Fotograf. In the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the artist Hilton Holloway was responsible for a number of projected images of cars in development, first through graphic art, followed later by Photoshop compositing artwork. In 2001 one of his concepts for a Lotus Formula 1 was so accurate that 'Project Hilton' became the code-name for the F1 project within Lotus. In 1992 Car was sold by FF Publishing to Emap. Emap published in the magazine until 2007. In March 2009 the magazine's listings section (which gives details of new cars on sale in the UK) reverted to the name 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' ‚Äì which it had used when it was created in the early 1970s ‚Äì after an absence of nearly three years.

He was the last white Administrator of South-West Africa, from 1985 through Namibian independence in 1990. Pienaar later served as a minister in F W de Klerk's government until 1993. He married Isabel Maud van Niekerk on 11 December 1954. Diplomat In the early 1980s, Louis Pienaar was assigned to Paris as South Africa's ambassador to France. Namibia On 1 July 1985, Pienaar was appointed by the National Party government to be Administrator-General (AG) of South-West Africa, a territory that the United Nations Security Council called Namibia and which UNSC Resolution 435 of 1978 declared was being administered illegally by South Africa.Text of UNSCR 435 of 1978 Two years after AG Pienaar's appointment, when prospects for Namibian independence seemed to be improving, UN Commissioner for Namibia (UNCN) Bernt Carlsson, was appointed. Upon South Africa's relinquishing control of Namibia, Commissioner Carlsson's role would be to take over the administration of the country on behalf of the UN, formulate its framework constitution, and organise free and fair elections based upon a non-racial universal franchise. =Serious negotiations= In May 1988, a United States mediation team ‚Äì headed by Chester A. Crocker, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs ‚Äì brought negotiators from Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, and observers from the Soviet Union together in London. Later in May, at the Reagan/Gorbachev summit in Moscow (29 May ‚Äì 1 June 1988), it was decided that Cuban troops would be withdrawn from Angola, and Soviet military aid would cease, as soon as South Africa withdrew from Namibia. The New York Accords ‚Äì agreements to give effect to these decisions ‚Äì were drawn up for signature at UN headquarters in New York City in December 1988. Cuba, South Africa, and the People's Republic of Angola agreed to a total Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola. This agreement ‚Äì known as the Brazzaville Protocol ‚Äì established a Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC), with the US and the Soviet Union as observers, to oversee implementation of the accords. A bilateral agreement between Cuba and Angola was signed at UN headquarters on 22 December 1988. On the same day, a tripartite agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa was signed, whereby South Africa agreed to hand control of Namibia to the United Nations. (Tragically, UNCN Bernt Carlsson was not present at the signing ceremony. He was killed on flight Pan Am 103 which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December 1988 en route from London to New York. South African foreign minister Pik Botha and an official delegation of 22 had a lucky escape. Their booking on Pan Am 103 was changed at the last minute, and Botha, together with a smaller delegation, caught the earlier Pan Am 101 flight to New York.) =Transition to independence= UN Security Council adopted resolution 632 on 16 February 1989 requiring that implementation of UNSCR 435 should officially start on 1 April 1989.Text of UNSCR 632 of 1989 AG Pienaar, under the supervision of UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari who arrived in Windhoek in April 1989 to head the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, began Namibia's transition to independence. The transition got off to a shaky start because, contrary to SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma's written assurances to the UN Secretary-General to abide by an agreed cease- fire and repatriate from Angola only unarmed Namibians, the South Africans alleged that approximately 2,000 armed members of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), SWAPO's military wing, crossed the border from Angola in an apparent attempt to establish a military presence in northern Namibia. Under pressure from AG Pienaar and South Africa's foreign minister Pik Botha, UNTAG's Martti Ahtisaari took advice from British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who was visiting Southern Africa at the time, and authorised a limited contingent of South African troops to aid the South West African Police (SWAPOL) in restoring order. A period of intense fighting followed, during which 375 PLAN fighters were reported to have been killed.Let's not bury the 1 April killings =Actions by AG Pienaar= On 7 April, AG Pienaar announced that he was unilaterally suspending the independence process, but his decision was quickly repudiated by Pik Botha.Difficult start in Namibia's transition to independence On 11 April, he stated that, contrary to previous undertakings, UNTAG and the South African security forces had \\"agreed that PLAN soldiers would be interrogated in order to verify the suspected number of infiltrators\\". Botha overruled AG Pienaar's statement saying \\"there is no question of interrogation\\". On 22 May, AG Pienaar proclaimed AG 11 of 1989: \\"Establishment and Powers of the Commission for the Prevention and Combatting of Intimidation and Electoral Malpractices\\".Proclamations by the Administrator General On 8 June, AG 14 of 1989 was proclaimed: \\"First Law amendment (Abolition of Discriminatory or Restrictive Laws for purposes of Free and Fair Elections)\\". On 12 June, AG Pienaar declared a general amnesty against prosecution for all Namibians living abroad and repealed or amended 46 discriminatory laws. (He extended the amnesty eight months later to South African officials and security personnel including the South African Defence Force.) Following complex negotiations with UNTAG concerning electoral voting procedures, AG Pienaar proclaimed AG 19 of 1989: \\"Registration of Voters (Constituency Assembly Proclamation)\\" on 30 June. Registration of voters began on 4 July, and AG Pienaar published a draft proclamation on the election process on 21 July. UNTAG was concerned by this draft, insisting that political party agents should be present at the polling stations and at the counting of the votes. In this way, the Namibian people could be reassured that the voting would be free and fair. The South African side opposed the idea, indicating their determination to dominate the constitution-making process and retain control for as long as possible. On 13 October, AG Pienaar proclaimed AG 49 of 1989: \\"The Holding of an Election for a Constituent Assembly\\". =Demobilization= At the end of August, the UN Security Council called for the immediate demobilization of all paramilitary groups in Namibia (UNSCR 640 of 1989)Text of UNSCR 640 of 1989 and a week later AG Pienaar announced he was suspending the activities of the Koevoet paramilitary force. The Koevoet issue had been one of the most difficult UNTAG faced.UNTAG report on Namibia This counter-insurgency unit was formed by South Africa after the adoption of UNSCR 435, and was not, therefore, mentioned in the settlement proposal or related documents. The UN regarded Koevoet as a paramilitary unit which ought to be disbanded but the unit continued to deploy in the north in armoured and heavily armed convoys. In June 1989, Martti Ahtisaari told AG Pienaar that this behaviour was totally inconsistent with the Settlement Proposal, which required the police to be lightly armed. Moreover, the vast majority of the Koevoet personnel were quite unsuited for continued employment in the South West African Police (SWAPOL). Pik Botha announced on 28 September 1989 that 1,200 ex-Koevoet members would be demobilized with effect from the following day. A further 400 such personnel were demobilized on 30 October. These demobilizations were supervised by UNTAG military monitors. =Democratic elections= The 11-month transition period ended relatively smoothly. Political prisoners were granted amnesty, discriminatory legislation was repealed, South Africa withdrew all its forces from Namibia, and some 42,000 refugees returned safely and voluntarily under the auspices of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Almost 98% of registered voters turned out to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. The elections were held in November 1989 and were certified as free and fair by UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds necessary to have a free hand in revising the framework constitution that had been formulated not by UNCN Bernt Carlsson but with the help of AG Pienaar. The opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance received 29% of the vote. The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on 21 November 1989 and resolved unanimously to use the 1982 Constitutional Principles in Namibia's new constitution. (According to The Guardian of 26 July 1991, Pik Botha told a press conference that the South African government had paid more than ¬£20 million to at least seven political parties in Namibia to oppose SWAPO in the run-up to the 1989 elections. He justified the expenditure on the grounds that South Africa was at war with SWAPO at the time.) =Independence celebrations= Namibia's Independence Day celebrations took place in the Windhoek Sports Stadium on 21 March 1990. Numerous international representatives attended, including 20 heads of state, and the arrival of Nelson Mandela, who had just been released from prison, caused excitement among the 30,000 spectators. United Nations Secretary-General, Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, and the President of South Africa, F W de Klerk, jointly conferred independence on Namibia. AG Pienaar formally handed over power to the president of SWAPO, Sam Nujoma, who was then sworn in as the first President of Namibia.Namibian independence celebrations Government minister In 1990, on his return to South Africa, Louis Pienaar was nominated to be Minister of Education in President F W de Klerk's government where he was responsible for the dismantling of the structures of apartheid. From May 1992 until April 1993, Pienaar was Minister for Internal Affairs. Death Pienaar died at his residence in Cape Town on 5 November 2012.

During the American Civil War the Indiana Legion was created, giving the militia an official role in the state and distinguishing them from the regiments called to federal duty who would later become the Indiana National Guard. During the Civil War the Legion played a prominent role in the Newburgh Raid, fought in the Battle of Corydon, was active throughout Morgan's Raid into Indiana, and patrolled the state's southern border and protected areas of importance. The Legion was renamed to the Liberty Guard in 1903 and served in various functions in the state. The Liberty Guard was renamed the Indiana Guard Reserve in 1916 and given a more formal role in the state. Air Wing There was formerly an Air Wing of the IGR, which wore a slightly-modified Air Force uniform. It was disbanded in the mid-1990s.  Uniform  Personnel of the Guard Reserve will be authorized to wear the U.S. Army duty uniforms, both Class A and B, as well as the Class C (ACU's ). Ownership of the Dress Blue is optional.

A Sicilian emigrant who made his fortune in Argentina, returned in Catania during the 1950s and, together with his brothers, founded in 1962 an amateur football club called Massiminiana, leading them up to Serie C, where they played for four consecutive seasons. In 1968, he became the owner of Calcio Catania, and immediately invested in his new club, obtaining a promotion to Serie A only one year later. He then resigned in 1972, following immediate relegation to Serie B followed by two poor seasons in the second- highest national division, but returned to serve as chairman two years later, immediately obtaining a second promotion. During the following years, Catania proved to be a yo-yo team, playing in all of the three highest national division, making a one-year comeback to Serie A in 1983. He left the club in 1987 following relegation to Serie C1 and criticisms by the local supporters. He however returned once again in 1992 to save the club from bankruptcy, but was unable to avoid a controversial cancellation of his club one year later. The club cancellation was later declared invalid by the Italian magistrature, and Catania was readmitted to Italian football, namely into the Eccellenza regional league, and immediately started to rise the football league pyramid with two consecutive promotions, despite Massimino's partial blindness and worsening health caused by diabetes. Angelo Massimino died in 1996, aged 69, in a road accident on the Palermo-Catania highway. His funeral in Catania was attended by over a thousand people. Massimino is still remembered by Catania supporters as their most representative chairman, and the local stadium, formerly known as Cibali, was named after him in 2002. He was also nationally known for his poor Italian language skills, heavily influenced by his Sicilian heritage, and several blunders who made him popular among Italian football fans.

He served with the 7th and 34th Infantry regiments in Texas and Arizona until September 1916 when he was detailed to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, for flying training at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California. Stratemeyer became a first lieutenant in June 1916. He became commanding officer of the United States Army Air Service Flying and Technical Schools at Kelly Field, Texas in May 1917. He became a captain in August 1917, assigned as school commandant of the School of Military Aeronautics Division ground school at Ohio State University, and later commanding officer of Chanute Field, Illinois. Stratemeyer was promoted to major in August 1918. With official transfer to the Air Corps from the Infantry in 1920 he went to Luke Field, Hawaii as commanding officer of the 10th Air Park. Stratemeyer returned to West Point in August 1924 as instructor in tactics. He graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field, Virginia, in June 1930 and from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1932. He remained at Leavenworth as an instructor for the next four years. Stratemeyer was promoted to lieutenant colonel in June 1936 and assigned to command the 7th Bomb Group at Hamilton Field, California. He graduated from the Army War College in 1939 and went to the office of the Chief of the United States Army Air Corps as head of the Training and Operations Division, with promotion to colonel in March 1940. A year later Stratemeyer became executive officer to General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of the Air Corps, and in August he was promoted to brigadier general. Stratemeyer commanded the Southeast Air Corps Training Center at Maxwell Field, Alabama, for five months and returned to Washington in June 1942 as chief of Air Staff for General Arnold. He had been promoted to major general in February 1942. World War II Stratemeyer went to the China Burma India Theater in mid-1943, appointed Commanding General of the Army Air Forces' India-Burma Sector, deputy Air Commander Southeast Asia, and commander of the Eastern Air Command, South East Asia Command (SEAC). Although officially air advisor to General Joseph Stilwell, his status was comparable to that of Stilwell. Part of Stratemeyer's command, the Tenth Air Force, had been integrated with the RAF Third Tactical Air Force in India in December 1943 and was operating under Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of SEAC. Another part of it, the Fourteenth Air Force in China, was under the jurisdiction of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as commander of the China Theater. And although the India- China Wing, Air Transport Command received its allocations of tonnage requirements for the Hump airlift from Stratemeyer as Stilwell's deputy, control of ICWATC resided with Headquarters ATC, in Washington. One of Stratemeyer's favorite cartoons showed him sitting at his desk surrounded by pictures of his eight bosses (Stilwell, Mountbatten, General George C. Marshall, Chiang, Arnold, Royal Air Force Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, Major General Daniel I. Sultan, and FDR), all of whom could give him orders in one or another of his capacities. Stratemeyer was promoted to lieutenant general in May 1945 and from April 1944 until March 1946 was commander of the Army Air Forces in the China Theater with headquarters at Chungking. Stratemeyer was a major figure in the retaliatory maneuvering after Stilwell's recall to force General Claire Chennault out as commander of the 14th Air Force, headquartered in Kunming. After the war, Stratemeyer commanded the Air Defense Command at Mitchel Field, New York, and the Continental Air Command, which was organized there in November 1948. At both positions, Stratemeyer tried to improve America's warning system. Korean War Stratemeyer went to Tokyo in April 1949 as commanding general of Far East Air Forces, which he led through the first year of the Korean War. His units responded rapidly to the North Koreans' invasion of the South and provided South Korea and General Douglas MacArthur with the vital air arm. General Stratemeyer had a serious heart attack in Tokyo in May 1951 and was confined to the Air Force hospital at nearby Tachikawa Air Base. Stratemeyer retired on January 31, 1952. He died August 11, 1969. Decorations Stratemeyer awards include the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters; Distinguished Flying Cross; Air Medal with oak leaf cluster; American Defense Service Medal; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with five service stars; European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with service star; World War I Victory Medal; World War II Victory Medal; American Campaign Medal with service star; National Defense Service Medal; Korean Service Medal with four service stars; Mexican Border Service Medal; Ho-Tu Medal of Chinese Air Force; Tashou Cloud Banner (Chinese); British Companion of the Order of the Bath Chinese Special; Chinese Pilot's Badge; Polish Order of Polonia Restituta Commander's Cross; Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire; Yugoslavian pilot's badge.

History On 23 November 1980, the Urban Transit Authority commenced operating the Sydney Explorer looping the Sydney central business district. It was operated with Mercedes-Benz O305 and O405 buses that apart from being painted in red Sydney Explorer livery and having a public address system, were identical to those used in normal service. In 1990, a fleet of six (later increased to eight) Pressed Metal Corporation bodied Mercedes-Benz O405 coaches were introduced. In September 1998, the Bondi & Bay Explorer was introduced operating from Circular Quay to the Eastern Suburbs. It was operated by four Ansair bodied Scania L113CRLs painted in a blue livery.\\"Bondi and Bay Explorer\\" Fleetline issue 257 November 1998 page 202 In November 2010, both services were sold to City Sightseeing who had been operating open top bus tours in Sydney since the early 2000s.Changes to Explorer services and SydneyPass tickets from Sunday 28 November Sydney Buses November 2010City Sightseeing Australian Bus Fleet Lists No buses were included in the sale, with City Sightseeing continuing to operate its existing routes only with its fleet of MCW Metrobuses.

When Ensignbus sold the City Sightseeing business in 2011, it retained ownership of the Sydney operation. In 2016, Sydney Explorer relinquished its City Sightseeing franchise and became a Big Bus Tours affiliate.Bus Tours from Sydney Explorer Big Bus Tours Tickets A casualty of the takeover by City Sightseeing was the one-day pass on the Sydney Explorer which was no longer valid.

It was discovered on 5 February 1929, by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg- K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in Germany. The asteroid was named for the fruit- bearing tree Cydonia (quince). The S-type asteroid has a relatively short rotation period of 2.7 hours.  Orbit and classification  Cydonia is a member of the Eunomia family (), a prominent family of stony asteroids and the largest one in the intermediate main belt with more than 5,000 members. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.3‚Äì2.9 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,528 days; semi-major axis 2.60 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 13¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first and official discovery observation at Heidelberg in February 1929.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Cydonia is a stony S-type asteroid, in-line with the Eunomia family's overall spectral type. = Rotation period = In December 2015, a rotational lightcurve of Cydonia was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Etscorn Observatory () in New Mexico, United States. Lightcurve analysis gave a well- defined rotation period of 2.679 hours with a brightness variation of 0.28 magnitude (). In April 2017, Spanish astronomers at Pu√ßol Observatory () and other stations of the APTOG-network measured a similar period of 2.6700 hours and an amplitude of 0.10 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Cydonia measures between 12.140 and 12.95 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1719 and 0.241. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.21 ‚Äì derived from 15 Eunomia, the family's parent body and namesake ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 13.26 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the genus Cydonia in the family Rosaceae, with the fruit-bearing quince tree as its only member. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). = Reinmuth's flowers = Due to his many discoveries, Karl Reinmuth submitted a large list of 66 newly named asteroids in the early 1930s. The list covered his discoveries with numbers between and . This list also contained a sequence of 28 asteroids, starting with 1054 Forsytia, that were all named after plants, in particular flowering plants (also see list of minor planets named after animals and plants).

Being largely rural in nature the railway has many of these scattered along the existing South Line, and there were, as one might expect, many more on the closed sections of the railway. These can be summarised as follows, along with other points of interest along the line not covered in the Isle of Man Railway stations section:- The South Line =Nunnery Bridge= The first major structure on the line, carrying it over the River Douglas before the climb through the Nunnery Cutting, the original bridge was replaced in the winter of 1979. =White Hoe= The first level crossing on the south line, remaining ungated until the addition of automated barriers in 2001, it served the access road to an isolation hospital of the same name, demolished and replaced with a youth correctional facility in recent times. The two-storey gatekeepers house was also demolished and replaced; in 1993 a train collided with a car here. =Meary Veg= Site of the all-island sewage works, a new bridge over the railway was constructed here in 2001. =Rifle Range= A request stop also titled Ballacostain was established here for the adjacent rifle range, used by pupils of King William's College in Castletown. The site of the grass platform is still barely discernible today. =Ballalonna= This is the first \\"proper\\" level crossing on the south line of the Isle of Man Railway and can be found on the south side of Santon station; it serves an adjoining farm of the same name. The crossing was provided with a small hut similar in style to the one at Mill Road further along the line and this is retained though out of use, being constructed of slatted timber with corrugated iron roof. =Ballastrang= This crossing is complete with its own (now privately owned) crossing lodge which was sold off and replaced with a common or garden shed in more recent years. The crossing was the subject of controversy in 2002 when all crossings on the railway were automated. The local farmer who utilises the crossing refused to allow the railway to install the automatic barriers as it had elsewhere and so therefore this remains the final surviving manned occupational level crossing on the railway, and indeed on the island. =Ballawoods= A farm crossing on the approach to the station at Ballasalla. It has been unmanned since automation in 2002 when the traditional level crossing gates were replaced with modern lifting barrier controls. This crossing, despite only serving a nearby farm, is typical of the rural community and features a large (now derelict) gatekeeper's two storey house, once alleged to have been home to \\"Blackcurrant Jack\\", somewhat of a local legend who was once employed as crossing keeper and used to walk the line collecting blackberries for making jam between the train services. The original crossing keeper's house, which had been derelict for many years, was demolished in February 2018 as part of a new development taking place near the railway line. =Ballahick= A level crossing the northerly side of Ballasalla station, which was automated in 2002; prior to this the crossing was manned, and featured traditional crossing gates. The road it carries over the railway line leads only to a private dwelling. =Mill Road= A small level-crossing situated on the southerly side of Castletown railway station and consisting of a basic wooden hut for the gatekeeper to the side of the line. Being located close by the town it was never \\"fully manned\\" but merely attended at the relevant train times in latter years. By 2002 the crossing was automated but the small hut remained in place, though unused. The crossing serves a private dwelling which is clearly visible from the passing train, and is a large mill (now defunct) and farmhouse. . In early 2014 the original crossing lodge was removed for full restoration by volunteers of the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association and is currently stored in the goods shed at Port St. Mary awaiting funding to proceed. The group hope to return to the restored building to the site by the springof 2017. =School Hill= A temporary station was established here in 2012 when the railway operated out of season school trains during a bus drivers' dispute; the temporary platform was made from scaffolding and a marquee erected as a waiting area; the site was cleared in 2013 and stands close to the marshalling area of the Billown Circuit of the Southern 100 motorcycle races. =Kentraugh= A small farm track which had, until 2002, a seasonally manned level crossing. Until automation there was a creosoted shed for the crossing keeper, but the crossing was rarely manned between trains and staff usually attended at the relevant train times on the timetable. The crossing is located between the stations at Colby and Level on the southern portion of the line. =Ballagawne= A level crossing situated between the stations of Level and Port St Mary on south line of the railway which remains open today. It consists of a crossing keepers' lodge which is now disused since the introduction of automatic crossing barriers in 2002 and provides access to the farm of the same name through means of through road which connects the \\"back\\" Colby road to the main coast road. The crossing lodge is larger than many others on the railway and was substantial enough to have provided residential accommodation for the keeper in the past, effectively being twice the size of the original structure. This is clear upon viewing the building from a passing train. The lodge was sold privately in February 2015. =Four Roads= Bisecting the main coastal road between Castletown and Port Erin, this crossing still boasts its own stone-built gatekeepers' hut and the gatekeepers' house remains extant on the southern side of the line although this is now a private residence. A roundabout further up the highway has also gained this title, taken from the railway's crossing.. The small lodge here was restored by the volunteers of the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association in 2013 at which time it was fitted with bilingual running in board (now also reading Kiare Raaidyn), new fencing and the whole area smartened up considerably. Similar works have also been carried out at other former manned occupational crossings along the line. The Peel Line =Pulrose Racecourse= An early level crossing point, later being replaced by a road bridge carrying the Pulrose Road, this was initially made into a request stop titled simply 'Racecourse' serving the nearby horse racing circuit on the site of today's National Sports Centre; during the construction of the sporting arena and nearby housing estate sidings were laid here for construction trains to deposit building materials, resulting in the bridge being of dual construction, though one aperture was never used. =Quarterbridge= This was the point where the railway crossed the main road for the first time and was initially provided with a standard stone-built lodge which remains extant today albeit derelict; later a crossing keepers' house was constructed and the site became a short-lived request stop in connection with motorcycle events (the famous T.T. circuit is next to the railway at this point. Long after closure an access road was established on the trackbed, opening in 1988, commencing from this point. =Ballacraine= Originally a level crossing point for the St. John's to Foxdale Road, this was briefly another request stop, again in connection with the T.T. races, being a short walk from the popular observation point at Ballacraine Crossroads, where scenes in the George Formby film No Limit! where filmed. It remained a manned level crossing until the closure of the railway and the stone lodge remains in situ today. =Gravel Pits= Immediately before entering St. John's Station there was a short spur leading to the railway's sand and gravel pits, itself served by a narrow gauge railway with hand-propelled hopper wagons, visible on several period images of the station. The spur remained in place long after it ceased operation as did the plant machinery on the site. =Glenfaba Mill= A large rustic watermill which is passed by trains and remains in situ today although out of use for many years; this was a popular place for the railway to use for commercial postcards and several were produced featuring the mill and its associated bridge. =Knockaloe Branch= During the Great War a spur was constructed from the main line to the alien internment camp at Knockaloe Farm, worked exclusively by the former Manx Northern Railway locomotive Caledonia and ceasing to exist by 1921, it ran straight into the camp itself with goods' only services; limited images of the line show the locomotive and a variety of wagons in use; the farm still exists as does the shed used to house the locomotive. =Brickworks Flangeway= This horse-drawn tramway crossed the main Douglas-Peel railway just outside the station yard at Peel and ceased to operate during the Second World War; archive images from 1937 show the line in operation with horses drawing laden wagons across the railway line in the direction of the town. The North Line =Gob-Y-Deigan= The exposed coastal section of the Manx Northern Railway between Peel Road and Glen Mooar viaduct was served by a small halt in the very early days of the railway. This section of line caused the railway company headaches over many years owing to subsidence which was regularly rectified by the dumping of used locomotive ash along the sides of the running line. This area is also cited as the reason for the railway acquiring a turntable to turn only the coaches, to equalise the weathering of paintwork at this exposed point. Today the trackbed is walkable and it has sunk even further. The halt was only short-lived and built to serve excursions for picnickers. It had no road access but did offer a basic waiting shelter, which survived in use as a lineside hut until the closure of the railway. =Devil's Elbow= High embankment carrying the railway along the coastline; this caused the railway company many headaches over the years owing to continued subsidence. Large quantities of ash and spoil were regularly emptied here to shore up the embankment and it is noticeable that although the bank remains today it has dropped by several feet in the intervening years since the railway closed; it remains as part of the island's coastal footpath today. =Glen Mooar Viaduct= The first and smaller of two viaducts on the Manx Northern Railway and was crossed by means of a lattice work frame by the passing trains. Today the stanchions remain but the framework was removed in 1975, the railway having closed in 1968. It can be found at =Glen Wyllin Viaduct= Second larger viaduct carrying the railway above the valley which was home to the pleasure grounds owned and operated by the Railway Company; the viaduct was removed in 1975 although the stanchions still remain today. The viaduct dominated the parks below which featured a children's playground, boating lake, bowling greens, tennis courts and putting green. The site remains as a campsite today but the majority of the former features have been removed. A Campsite toilet and shower block has been provided in more recent times and a shop, the area remains popular today forming part of a national glen. =Orrisdale No. 1 & No.2= Two crossings at close proximity found at and with associated crossing keepers' dwellings, both of which now form private residences since the closure of the railway in 1968 and sale of much property in 1975. =West Berk= The halt was only short- lived and, while recorded in Manx Northern Railway documents, its exact location is not known for certain other than as being adjacent to a level crossing. The crossing lodge remains in situ today, forming a private residence having been sold off in 1974. =Ballavolley Halt= Only operational in the last year that the Isle of Man Railway operated the line to Ramsey in 1968. Prior to this it had been nothing more than a farm crossing which boasted its own lodge, still in existence today; the \\"Wild Life Park\\" was established here in late 1967 and the railway installed an ad hoc halt here the following year, with temporary platform area and fencing. Today, you cross over the remaining rails in the macadam on the way into the park, and the trackbed stretches out virtually straight either side of you, but the rails are the only hint of the line's existence. At one time there was a siding laid here but little is known of its use and it did not last long. The embankment on which it sat is sometimes visible in a nearby field however. =Milntown= Site of former oil siding (1968-1969) found at used during the short-lived experiment to transport oil in three tankers between Ramsey and Peel during the period in which Lord Ailsa operated the railway; this siding has the distinction of being used for the final stock movements on the north line when No. 4 Loch transported the final oil tankers in September 1968. The track at this point was so sharply curved that a locomotive could not enter the siding, and bogie runners were placed between it and the oil wagons to allow access to the facility. =Quayside Extension= Extending beyond the environs of Ramsey Station along the quayside and lifted by 1958.

He later battled schizophrenia. Ice hockey Owen grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, and attended Harvard University, where he was a defenseman on three Ivy League championship teams. In 1957, he won Harvard‚Äôs Angier Trophy for the player who made the greatest improvement. He graduated from Harvard in 1958. At his induction into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1982, he was described as a ‚Äúhard-hitting player who could move an opponent from in front of the net.‚Äù He was on the 1960 Winter Olympics hockey team with several of his Harvard teammates, including Bill Cleary and Bob Cleary, winning the gold by beating Canada, Soviets and Czechoslovakia. It was the nation‚Äôs first gold medal in men‚Äôs hockey. Mental breakdown He visited Communist countries with the U.S. national hockey team in 1959 and worked on classified projects at balloon company, Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, beginning in 1960. He later described these times to his friends as specifically troubling and paranoia-inducing. Owen had a breakdown in 1963 in San Francisco. In the late 1960s, he moved to Topeka, Kansas where he committed himself to the Menninger Clinic for treatment his schizophrenia. He would be released from the in- patient facility three years later, but never moved more than four miles from the hospital. Community involvement In 1973, he began teaching at Washburn University School of Business. Owen became a local hero in Topeka hockey, so much so that the adult hockey league in that city named its championship cup after him (the Owen Cup). He also helped to construct numerous veterans monuments in the Topeka area. Death On October 5, 2007 a white Lincoln Continental was found burning in a field in Topeka, Kansas. A body was found inside, severely burned. A week later it was determined to be the remains of Edwyn Owen. The Kansas state Fire Marshall's Office determined that the car's heated catalytic converter set fire to the dense dry grass around the vehicle. Only later was Owen's increasingly bizarre behavior reported. He hung up abruptly on the phone with old friends, left rambling telephone messages and claimed he was a character in a fictional children's book.

It was founded in 1969 as a private co-ed school and was the first Catholic co-educational boarding school established in New Zealand. History The idea of a Catholic secondary school in Gore was that of long- serving parish priest (1947‚Äì1972), Father (later Monsignor) Finlay. The 30-acre (12 hectare) site of the college was gradually purchased during the 1950s and 1960s and appeals were launched for funds in those decades for the construction of the school. In 1961, the Capuchin Fathers undertook to provide the staff and they became involved in the fund-raising activities in Gore. The first building work commenced with the object of opening the school in 1964. However, after the completion of the staff house and one dormitory, the Capuchins withdrew from the project. Fund-raising continued and in 1965 the Rosminian Order (the Institute of Charity) committed themselves to staff the school. The \\"advance guard\\" of Rosminians, Father S Marriott and Brother J Tadesco arrived and they worked with the \\"central committee\\" on the fund- raising project. A classroom block was built. In 1968 Father L Hurdidge was appointed Headmaster. At the time of his appointment he was Deputy Head at St Gregory's College, Huddersfield which was a co-educational school. From the beginning of the project it was assumed that the Gore school would be boys- only but at the time of Father Hurdidge's appointment it was evident that it should be co-educational. His experience in Huddersfield was relevant to the decision to do this. The name of the School, St Peter's, was adopted and it was agreed that it would be staffed by the Sisters of Mercy and the Rosminians. The college was opened by Bishop Kavanagh of Dunedin on 26 January 1969, commencing with classes Form 1‚Äì3 (Years 7‚Äì9). The first staff consisted of: Fathers L Herdidge (Headmaster), J Buckner, B Hogan, Brothers J Tadesco, E Willett, J Wallace, Sisters Mary David (Senior Mistress), Mary Fidelus and Mary Stephena. Some of the Rosminians came from Rosmini College, Takapuna. The science block was completed soon after the school opened and later a gymnasium and two technical blocks were added. It was decided to build only one of the three proposed dormitory blocks, \\"Rosmini House\\", but a house bought on land in Kakapo Street opposite the school was renovated as a hostel for senior boys. It was named St Paul's Without the Walls and known as St Paul's. The school chapel, built to an interesting and unusual design conducive to a prayerful atmosphere of peace and serenity, was opened in 1978. One important personality in the early years of the school was Brother Tedesco (\\"Brother Ted\\"). He was in charge of St Paul's and his service to the wider community included being elected to the Gore Borough Council. The Rosminians also took up some parish duties in the wider area. Fathers Kearns and Moynihan were successively parish priests of Mataura. The school became a State-integrated school on 1 February 1982. The school is now completely lay-staffed. College Houses The school has four houses which divide the students into groups for events such as athletics, swimming, cultural and community events. They are: McAuley (blue), Rosmini (yellow), Finlay (green) and Pompallier (red). Mother Catherine McAuley was the founder of the Sisters of Mercy. Antonio Rosmini was the founder of the Rosminians. Monsignor Finlay was the parish priest of Gore who inspired, and laboured unceasingly towards, the building of the college and Bishop Pompallier was the founder of the Catholic Church in New Zealand. The college has a tradition of keeping the same house in family groups. \\"Rosmini House,\\" the boarding hostel, also has its own set of two houses which the boarding students belong to. They are: Tedesco (orange) and Buckner (purple). Brother Tedesco (Brother Ted) was an important member of the original staff of the college (see above). Father Buckner was a staff member of St Peter's College. Academic The college is one of the highest ranking in the southern region. In 2004 and 2006 the school was the highest achieving in Southland, according to NCEA results.

Although a Muslim and a loyal vassal of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, he failed to ensure his kingdom‚Äôs security and most of his reign was marked by Lekianoba - incessant inroads by the Dagestani mountainous clansmen. Biography David was a son of King Erekle I of Kakheti and Queen Anna n√©e Cholokashvili. He was born and raised at the shah‚Äôs court at Isfahan and installed as wali (viceroy) of Kakheti upon his father‚Äôs retirement to Iran in 1703. David resided at Qara Aghach or Qaraghaji in eastern Kakheti, on the borders of Shirvan, but had to move his residence to Telavi after he failed to recover Balakan from the Lesgians of Char and lost Qakh to them in 1706. After the death of his father in 1709, Erekle was ordered to Isfahan to receive investiture from Shah Husayn, leaving his younger brother Teimuraz and mother Anna in charge of the government. The years of his obliged absence at the Shah‚Äôs court (1711‚Äì15), were troubled by the Dagestan attacks and peasant revolts. Returning to Kakheti, David attempted to bring the situation under control. He made an alliance with Jesse, ruler of the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli, and marched against Dagestan, but he suffered defeat and failed to prevent settlements of the Lesgians in the Kakhetian borderlands. In December 1719, he met Vakhtang VI of Kartli and negotiated a new alliance against the Dagestani clans. Early in 1720, reinforcements sent by Vakhtang under the command of Prince Erasti Kaplanishvili arrived in Kakheti, but David refrained from another expedition and sent the Kartlian army back home. David died at his summer residence at Magharo in 1722 and was buried at Qum, Iran. Family David was married twice. His first wife was a daughter of the shamkhal of Tarki; the second one was Yatri Jahan-Begum, daughter of Shakhrukh-Zadeh, beylerbey of Erivan. All his children were by the second marriage: *Levan (Mahmud Reza Mirza) (died 1734), governor of Ganja for the Shah of Iran. He was killed in battle with the Ottoman Topal Osman Pasha. He had three sons: Asan Mirza, Ivane, and Rostom-Mirza. *Alexander (Nazar 'Ali Mirza) (died 1737), governor of Tiflis during the absence of King Teimuraz II from 1736 to 1738. *Hasan-Mirza (died 1750), Georgian envoy to Nader Shah in 1734.

It is eight miles (13 km) northeast of downtown Wheeling and is owned by the Ohio County Commission.MapQuest map showing airport in Ohio and Brooke counties. Retrieved 2007-10-09. The first passenger airline flights were TWA and Capital DC-3s in 1947; All American Airways arrived in 1949. Lake Central arrived at the beginning of 1961 and TWA and Capital left that year. Allegheny was replaced by Allegheny Commuter in 1969-70 and Wheeling lost all service ten years later. Lake Central Airlines served Wheeling until their merger with Allegheny Airlines in 1968. It wasn't Allegheny Commuter that served Wheeling but Allegheny until they stopped service in 1970. According to the April 26, 1970 Allegheny timetable, AL had 2 round trips to Pittsburgh, using their own CV-580 prop jets. 1970 was the last year that saw local carrier airline service. In the later 1970's two commuter carriers started round trip service PIT-HLG within days of each other, providing up to 7 departures a day. Aeromech (Clarksburg WV) & Christman Air System (Washington, PA) used EMB 110 planes (18 passengers) & Christman used Beech 99 (15 seats). Neither service lasted very long due to lack of demand. Facilities The airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 3/21 is 5,002 x 150 ft. (1,525 x 46 m) and 16/34 is 4,499 x 150 ft. (1,371 x 46 m).

He is the second child of Bienvenido Noriega and Socorro Munoz of Cauayan, Isabela and Cabatuan, Isabela, respectively. He finished his secondary education at St. Anthony School, Singalong, Malate (Salutatorian, 1968), and his tertiary education at the University of the Philippines (A.B. Economics, cum laude and Valedictorian of the class, 1971 and M.A. Economics, 1973). He continued his postgraduate studies at Harvard University (Master in Public Administration, 1979; ‚ÄúA‚Äù student) and at Columbia University (Executive Program in Business Administration, 1983). At the University of the Philippines, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he took up courses such as Modern Drama, Shakespeare, Comedy and Film Theory. He worked for the Philippine government for more than twenty years (most of them were at the National Economic and Development Authority as Director, Policy Coordination Staff and Philippine National Bank, as Executive Vice President, Corporate Services). He taught part-time at U.P. Diliman and U.P. Manila, Ateneo, La Salle, Assumption, and U.E. Noriega worked for Experimental Cinema of the Philippines , Tanghalang Pilipino and was co-founder of Dramatis person√¶. And even before he succumbed to cancer in 1994, Noriega was Executive Vice President at a large bank in Makati, Philippines.  Summary of notable accomplishments  Overview Bienvenido M. Noriega Jr. received posthumously two national honors. One was the Tanglaw ng Lahi award for Theater from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1995. The second was the prestigious Centennial Honors for the Arts in Theater from the Cultural Center of the Philippines and Philippine Centennial Commission in 1999. Prior to succumbing to cancer in 1994 at the young age of 42, Noriega was recipient of more than 22 major awards for writing ‚Äì six from the Cultural Center of the Philippines, thirteen from the Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, one each from Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) and Palihang Aurelio Tolentino. He also received four National Book Awards from the Manila Critics Circle. His award winning works have been frequently staged by both professional and student theater companies in the country and in the USA, Canada, UK. Athens, Geneva, Paris and as far as Qatar. He directed a lot of his plays and even delved in musicales writing the libretto for \\"Kenkoy loves Rosing\\" and \\"Bituing Marikit\\" and wrote the song lyrics of \\"Tuldukan na'ng hapis\\" for Basil Valdez. Resume Born in Cauayan, Isabela, Noriega‚Äôs native dialects were Ilocano and Ibanag, but he picked up on Tagalog and English through rental of Tagalog and Marvel komiks. He finished elementary school at St. Ferdinand College in Ilagan, Isabela, and high school at St. Anthony School in Singalong, Manila. He completed A.B. Economics at the University of the Philippines within 3 years at the age of 18. After graduating cum laude and valedictorian of class of 1971, he went on to earn his M.A. Economics at the same university, again graduating as class valedictorian in 1973. He was College Councilor and the Philippinensian Yearbook editor. He wrote his first play ‚ÄúDown the Basement‚Äù in 1970 after attending a playwriting course at the University of the Philippines, which was eventually published in the Philippine Collegian Folio. He was sent to the Kennedy School of Harvard University in 1979 for a Master‚Äôs degree in Public Administration (MPA). He graduated at the top of his Edward S. Mason Fellows class with straight A‚Äôs. He then went for further studies in Columbia University for his Executive Program in Business Administration, finishing in 1983. And while he was in those universities, he took up courses such as Modern Drama, Shakespeare, Comedy and Film Theory. He worked for the Philippine government for more than twenty years. He was the youngest NEDA Director at 23 when he managed the Policy and Coordination Staff of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) from 1971-1981. He was likewise the youngest to be appointed as Executive Vice President, Corporate Services at the Philippine National Bank, from 1981-1993. There he also served as president of PNB Investments Ltd and a director of PNB Securities Inc. He taught part-time in U.P. Diliman and U.P. Manila, Ateneo, La Salle, Assumption, and U.E. [Ateneo is now considering to also nominate Noriega for the National Artist award.] He also worked for Experimental Cinema of the Philippines and for Tanghalang Pilipino and was co-founder of Dramatis Personae. Some Awards and Citations In conferring the Tanglaw ng Lahi award to Noriega in 1995, Ateneo De Manila stated that: ‚ÄúThe significance of Noriega‚Äôs achievement in Theater and Film will be impoverished unless it is put in place with his career in banking and government service. Here one does not find the simple case of competition between work and avocation or between two careers or even loves. Noriega was expert in his two occupations ‚Äì as writer and technocrat and he managed to put them together in his person. ‚ÄúNoriega has put form to the Filipino‚Äôs search for a sense of place in these works. His characters often find themselves out of place--literally and in every aspect. In probably his most popular play, Bayan-bayanan, they are Philippine Embassy staff, government employees training abroad, overseas contract workers, and other Filipino travelers exiled in Geneva. ‚ÄúThere each of them has to contend with not only the bitter cold but also their individual fates and the usual situation of the exile, and their different responses to this plight are what Noriega is able to masterfully orchestrate. ‚ÄúPoverty makes Ramona Reyes, a household help in the play bearing her name, out of place in Forbes Park where she works. Ironically, going abroad as a domestic helper appears to her as her only escape. The myriad forms of exile are more directly depicted in Takas, a play about friendship between a Vietnamese refugee who comes to shore and the Filipino boy whose family takes in the stranger. In no time, the boy discovers that he too is a stranger in his own country. ‚ÄúBatang Pro, a controversial work about child prostitution, portrays the tragedy of children pushed out of their very childhood by dehumanizing destitution, while the film Soltero shows the anguish of an aging single male in a culture centered on family. ‚ÄúBy presenting characters who are out of place and at the same time, refusing an easy way out for their dilemma, Noriega ennobles the plight and struggle of the Filipino. He takes an insider‚Äôs point of view to depict outsiders‚Äô lives, and thus is able to confront, even satirize, every facet of Filipino life without despair nor disdain. The Filipino family takes center stage in Ang Mga Propesyonal and Kasalan sa Likod ng Simbahan, romance in Kenkoy Loves Rosing and W.I.S. (Walang Ibig Sabihin) and politics in Bongbong at Kris.‚Äù ‚Äú It would be a mistake to think that Noriega‚Äôs sole achievement lies in having given voice to what every Filipino feels. His writing broke new artistic ground because the voices of his characters were neither the hysterical sobs of traditional Filipino melodrama nor the rhetorical protest of propaganda pieces. He wrote plays of differing structures and styles. Some are one- acters, others full-length. In a few, the influence of Chekhov appears; in others, that of the expressionists. ‚ÄúThe role that music played changed from play to play. This creative freedom, far from simple experimentation, was based on his insight into the dynamics of insider and outsider; it enabled him to use styles and techniques wherever he found them without being afraid of being derivative. He always knew where he was writing from.‚Äù In her book review in 1988, Doreen Fernandez wrote: ‚ÄúNoriega‚Äôs skill is especially evident in the dialogue, which reproduces many different levels of colloquial Filipino (the college girl type, the movie/television gay variants, the almostformal etc.), the editions of code-switching, and the variations proper to each character. The writer‚Äôs ear is true and his comic hand sure. ‚ÄúBongbong at Kris which won a prize in the 1987 Cultural Center of the Philippines Playwriting contest, was one of the first plays written and staged after the end of the Marcos regime. This was a time when the playwrights who had written veiled and direct protest plays in the previous two decades were reassessing the matter for drama after the end of a period of unspoken but real censorship and suppression‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSana‚Äôy maaliw tayo‚Äù, Noriega ends, and indeed the play amuses and entertains. It is welcome comedy, since not too many contemporary playwrights - and indeed comparatively few in the history of Philippine drama - have devoted their talents to the comic genre. And it is welcome laughter, since it comments lightly but pointedly on the world of ‚Äúpelikula‚Äôt politika‚Äù ‚Äì on the mores and manners, on the pulsing and possible lives within Philippine media and politics.‚Äù Jose Dalisay wrote in his article ‚Äú A writer‚Äôs Baul‚Äù in Philstar.com, September 9, 2005: ‚ÄúHe was, to my mind, the best playwright we ever produced, bar none. His sense of the dramatic tended toward the deep, regretful sadness of foregone happiness and missed opportunities rather than riotous excess.‚Äù Dean Rogelio Sicat, UP in his book review of Deuterium in 1995 wrote: ‚ÄúI have observed the Philippine literary scene for over three decades as a practicing writer, a U.P. professor. Literary historian and critic, and as juror in all of the country‚Äôs most prestigious literary contests including the Carlos Palanca Awards for Literature (eight times), and the CCP. ‚ÄúWithout any reservation, I consider Bienvenido M. Noriega, Jr. as the best Filipino playwright today as evidenced by his output, books published, national awards, stagings in prestigious venues (including presentations abroad) and consistent recognition by peers and critics. ‚ÄúIn Noriega, Filipino playwriting finally hurdled being tentative to become the fullblown and lively genre that it is now. He broke new ground between stereotyped tradition-bound Tagalog plays. The dominant playwright from the seventies to the present, Noriega who writes in everyday Filipino has a wide- ranging repertoire , from the personal to the social, from the comic to the tragic.‚Äù His award in 1999 for Centennial Honors for the Arts (in Theater) read: ‚ÄúAng mga dula ni Bienvenido Noriega Jr.,mandudula ay kilala para sa kakaibang di-hayagang komentaryo sa masalimuot at nagtutunggaling pagpapahalaga‚Äôt identidad na Filipino.

He played with Roy Acuff's Smoky Mountain Boys and was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Though he released only a few recordings as a solo artist, he played as a session musician on numerous records, including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1972 album Will the Circle be Unbroken. Biography =Early years= Beecher Ray Kirby was born in rural Sevier County, Tennessee in the Great Smoky Mountains. His father, G. W. Kirby, was an Appalachian folk musician who played fiddle and banjo. As a child, Kirby learned to play guitar and banjo and sang gospel music. By his teens, he was playing for square dances. In the late 1920s, Kirby followed the path of many people from the Appalachian region and moved to the northern United States to find work. He went to Flint, Michigan and worked on the Buick assembly line. He lost his job, though, in the economic downturn of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Kirby then returned to music, playing at informal square dance parties held in the homes of other transplanted southerners. It was at one such party that Kirby met a Hawaiian guitarist named Rudy Waikiki. \\"That was when I first heard someone play something like my style. He was a real Hawaiian boy, from over in the islands, and he was playing this way and I loved it. I'd go to them parties just to watch him play,\\" Kirby said. \\"Then I'd go home and get my guitar and try to do the same thing. I was just playing a straight guitar and I had to raise the strings up, put a nut under the strings.\\"Bashful Brother Oswald, Brad's Page of Steel, retrieved 2007-10-09 With the music of Hawaii, played by Sol Ho ªopi ªi and other performers, gaining in popularity, Kirby bought his first resonator guitar, an early National model, and joined in the trend, playing in bars, cafes and beer gardens. He visited the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, playing in clubs and gaining a following. Some of the clubs he played in were owned by Al Capone. =Return to Tennessee= In a bid to find more steady work, Kirby moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in 1934. Taking the stage name Pete Kirby, he played resonator guitar with local bands, among them Roy Acuff's Crazy Tennesseans, later to become the Smoky Mountain Boys. Acuff joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and Kirby joined the Opry with Acuff's band on New Year's Day 1939.Humphreys, Mark. \\"Bashful Brother Oswald\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 30. It was with the Acuff band that Kirby became introduced as Bashful Brother Oswald, with Kirby posing as the brother of the band's banjoist, Rachel Veach (\\"Queen of the Hills\\"),Humphreys. p. 30. so that it would appear to audiences that the unmarried Veach was being chaperoned by a family member. To fit his new persona, Kirby created the clownish Oswald character, wearing a floppy, wide- brimmed hat, tattered bib overalls, oversized work shoes and adopting a braying laugh. Featured on the nationwide broadcasts of the Opry, Oswald created a sensation playing his resonator guitar on such songs as \\"Old Age Pension Check\\". The instrument, developed in the late 1920s, was still relatively new. Oswald and the Acuff band were featured in a Hollywood film, Grand Ole Opry for Republic Pictures, which gave the instrument even greater exposure. \\"People couldn't understand how I played it and what it was, and they'd always want to come around and look at it.\\" In addition to his guitar and banjo playing, Oswald was a vocalist, and his tenor voice can be heard on Acuff's hit songs, \\"Precious Jewel\\" and \\"Wreck on the Highway\\". =Later years= Oswald began his career as a solo artist and session musician in the 1960s. He released his self-titled debut album in 1962 on Starday Records. He joined the Rounder Records label in the 1970s, releasing around a half dozen albums over the years until his last recording, Carry Me Back, in 1999. His session work included working with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on Will the Circle Be Unbroken, an album that paid tribute to the old-time, traditional country musicians of Nashville, Tennessee, Roy Acuff, Maybelle Carter, Earl Scruggs, Merle Travis, Doc Watson and others. Bill Monroe declined to participate. Solo tracks by Kirby on Circle include \\"The End of the World\\" and his own composition, \\"Sailin' to Hawaii\\". Oswald was also present for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's follow-up album, Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two in 1989, singing backing vocals on the title track. Oswald was the sole member of the 1939 Smoky Mountain Boys that still accompanied Acuff at the time of Acuff's death in 1992. With former Smoky Mountain Boys bandmate Charlie Collins, Oswald formed the musical comedy duo \\"Os and Charlie\\", which was a fixture at the Opryland theme park and on the Grand Ole Opry.Dobro legend Beecher Bashful Brother Oswald Kirby: 1911-2002 , Gibson Guitars, retrieved 2007-10-09 He participated in 1994's The Great Dobro Sessions album, featured alongside such other resonator guitarists as Mike Auldridge, Jerry Douglas, Josh Graves, Rob Ickes, Tut Taylor and Gene Wooten.

It was discovered by Luigi Volta at the Pino Torinese Observatory in 1929, and named after the Fasces Lictores, Latin for \\"Fasci Littori\\", the symbol of the Italian fascist party.  Discovery  Lictoria as first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory on 17 October 1909. It was officially discovered on 30 March 1929, by Italian astronomer Luigi Volta at the Observatory of Turin near Pino Torinese, Italy. Three weeks later, on 17 March 1929, it was independently discovered by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg, Germany. The Minor Planet Center only acknowledges the first discoverer.  Orbit and classification  This asteroid is a member of the Hygiea family (), a very large family of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids, named after the fourth-largest asteroid, 10 Hygiea. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,076 days; semi-major axis of 3.18 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as at Heidelberg in October 1909.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the symbol of fascism used by the Italian Fascist Party. The symbol was called \\"Fasci Littori\\", or \\"Fasces Lictores\\" in Latin (derived from fasces and lictor). Several other things such as festivals (littoriali) and fast trains (littorine) were given related names during the fascist period. In particular, the Italian city of Latina was founded under the name \\"Littoria\\" in 1932. The author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel, corresponded with Italian-born astronomer Paul Comba to confirm the meaning for this asteroid.  Physical characteristics  In the Bus‚ÄìBinzel SMASS classification, Lictoria is a Xc-subtype that transitions from the X-type to the carbonaceous C-type asteroids. It has also been characterized as a primitive P-type asteroid by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The Hygiea family's overall spectral type is a mixture of C-type and somewhat brighter B-type asteroids. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurve of Lictoria have been obtained from photometric observations by astronomers William Koff, Eric Barbotin, Stefano Sposetti and Matthieu Conjat, as well as Hiromi and Hiroko Hamanowa (). Analysis f the best-rated lightcurve from February 2008 gave a rotation period of 8.5616 hours with a consolidated brightness variation between 0.16 and 0.30 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Lictoria measures between 69.93 and 86.724 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo between 0.05 and 0.066. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.045 and a diameter of 78.86 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.5.

Widely known as Kinky, because of his tight curly hair, Thompson's career illustrated one of the problems - unprofessional enforcement - that led to increasing opposition to National Prohibition in the United States (1920‚Äì1933). Thompson's first mention in the press occurred after he shot a moonshine still-tender through the stomach during a raid. Later Thompson reported that bootleggers attacked him late one night as he was driving on a deserted country road. He claimed that, while a car was overtaking him, he was shot in the arm. However, police investigators found substantial evidence that Thompson had fabricated the whole story. Thompson used a blackjack on a man who had no reputation for violence. A jury hearing the resulting case denounced Thompson for his brutal beating of the defendant. The judge who presided at the trial later called Thompson's supervisor into his chamber and warned him about Thompson's behavior. Thompson later blackjacked a twelve-year-old boy, the boy's mother, and his one-legged father. He subsequently pistol-whipped a manacled prisoner in full view of a crowd of onlookers who were outraged at his behavior. Thompson's \\"favorite tactic was to walk into a joint, grab a pitcher of beer, and pour the contents on the bar, then offer to reimburse the nearest drinker. If the man denied that the beer was his, [Thompson] would strike him over the head with a shot- filled blackjack, and then wring a confession by painfully twisting the victim's arm.\\" Bureau of Prohibition officials defended their agents' violence, arguing that they bravely had to consume alcohol as part of their undercover work and that it threatened their health and caused crazed behavior. However, a local newspaper asked why patrons who consumed the same beverages did not become similarly crazed with an uncontrollable desire to injure others and destroy property. Police summoned to a drunken fight between a couple in a parked car asked the driver to move on. At that point the driver became belligerent and reached for something in his coat but the driver fired first, fatally wounding Thompson. Thompson was eulogized as a martyr for the dry cause and his death was blamed on societal disrespect for law and order. Federal Prohibition officials later praised Thompson's \\"zeal\\" but never acknowledged that he had ever used excessive force.

Usually it consists of the epistome (labrum), two pairs of coxapophyses (endites, maxillary lobes) and often a labium. (2007): Morphology and Functional Anatomy. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 23ff The epistome is a projection that forms the anterior wall of the stomotheca. Its upper side is hardened and divided by a transverse invagination (sulcus). The part nearer the groove is sometimes called clypeus, the other one labrum. The area around the mouth is soft and flexible, often with a distal lobe. On the sides, the walls around the mouth are fused to the medial surfaces of the pedipalpal coxae, and a transverse muscle attaches to the inner surfaces of the epistomal walls. Coxapophyses are extensions from the pedipalps and first pair of legs. While hardened at the base, they end in large soft pads that work as lips. It some species there is a narrow canal (pseudotrachea) on the posterior surface of the pedipalpal coxapophysis, possibly conducting fluids into the digestive tract. Salivary glands lead into the preoral chamber from both pairs of coxapophyses. While most harvestmen have coxapophyses on the second pair of legs as well, these do not end in pad- like structures and are reduced in many groups. Where they are fully developed, they probably aid in food intake. Similar lobular structures are sometimes found on the two latter pairs of legs as well, but their function is unknown. The labium, when present, is a flattened plate derived from the somite of the first walking leg. While large in many Eupnoi and Dyspnoi, it is small in most Laniatores and absent in Cyphophthalmi.

Described as \\"an outspoken opponent of racism, injustice, greed and corruption, a passionate humanist with a vision of a just society\\",Greet de Boissiere, Annie,\\"Passionate humanist had vision\\", The Age, 11 April 2008. he was the author of four novels although most acclaimed for the first two: Crown Jewel and Rum and Coca-Cola, both originally published in the 1950s. A fifth novel called Homeless in Paradise remains unpublished. Biography  Ralph de Boissi√®re was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the son of Armand de Boissi√®re, a solicitor, and Maude Harper, an Englishwoman who died three weeks later. He attended Queen's Royal College and during this time discovered the Russian authors, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Gorky, Chekhov, Pushkin and Gogol, who were to remain a lasting influence: Initially he wished to become a concert pianist but on leaving school took a job as a salesman, which enlightened him to the living and working conditions of ordinary Trinidadians. He then became involved in left- wing and trade union politics, campaigning as well as writing. A story of his, \\"Booze and the Goberdaw\\", appeared in the 1929 Christmas issue of a short- lived publication called Trinidad, edited by Alfred Mendes and C. L. R. James. De Boissi√®re became part of the group of young writers, including James, who published in Trinidad's first literary magazine The Beacon (March 1931‚ÄìNovember 1933), edited by Albert Gomes. In 1935 he married Ivy Alcantara (died 1984) and they had two daughters. But in 1947, having lost his job and unable to find another one because of his political activities, he and his family left the country for Chicago, afterwards moving to the Australian city of Melbourne in 1948. He found work in Australia as salesman and a factory- hand. Aged 42, de Boissi√®re settled into a clerical job, from which he retired in 1980. In Australia he joined the Communist Party and had his first novel, Crown Jewel, published in 1952 by the leftist Australasian Book Society. Like all his work this depicts the struggles of the working class with realistic sympathy, culminating with a portrayal of a 1937 strike in Trinidad brutally put down by police shooting. He subsequently wrote four more novels and has been translated into Polish, German, Russian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Czech and Chinese. His work has been described by one critic as \\"combin[ing] social realism and political commitment with a concern for the culture of the feeling within the individual in a way that is unique not only among West Indian writers but among writers with a social conscience anywhere in the world.\\" The literary archive of Ralph de Boissi√®re is held at the National Library of Australia (Papers of Ralph de Boissi√®re) and comprises his manuscripts, \\"typescripts of his novels and screenplays; diaries; correspondence; reviews; and, photographic prints and negatives.\\" Personal life  In 2007, his centenary year, Ralph de Boissi√®re married his longtime companion, Dr. Annie Greet, his fourth novel, Call of the Rainbow, was published in Melbourne, and in November, he received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Trinidad and Tobago.

Early and personal life He was born in Dypv√•g to ship-owner Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen (1865‚Äì1960) and Magdalena Pedersen (1873‚Äì1920). He had eight siblings. The family moved to Kristiania in 1902, and he joined the family's company (John P. Pedersen & S√∏n) after finishing Kristiania Commerce School in 1917. He was a brother of John Ditlev-Simonsen and uncle to both Halfdan Ditlev-Simonsen, Jr. and Per Ditlev-Simonsen. In 1920 he married Else Heyerdahl (1899‚Äì1985), and had Hieronymus Heyerdahl as a father-in-law. He died in January 1978 in Oslo. Sports career Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen practised different sports in the club IF Ready, and, partly together with his four brothers, he won several Norwegian championships in bandy. Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen's first national title came in 1913, and the last in 1927. He played two matches for the national team. He was also capped five times for the Norway national football team, the first in 1915. He also competed in yacht racing. At the 1936 Summer Olympics he won the silver medal as crew member of the Norwegian boat Silja in the 8 metre event. He had taken his first King's Cup in Norway with that boat in 1930. He was a board member of the Norwegian Tennis Federation from 1918 to 1919 and of the Football Association of Norway for four years, chaired IF Ready from 1923 to 1927 and the Royal Norwegian Yacht Club from 1947 to 1949. From 1948 to 1966 he was a member of the International Olympic Committee, and he headed the organizational committee at the 1952 Winter Olympics. In the IOC he took over for Thomas Fearnley, following tradition since 1905 that Norway must have one IOC member at any time. Shipping and the Second World War In shipping, he started his own company in 1936. He was a board member of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association for some time, and during the Second World War he worked in Sweden, from 1943 as regional head of Nortraship. From 1945 to 1949 he chaired the supervisory council of Det Norske Veritas. Ditlev- Simonsen was amongst a number of prominent Norwegians arrested as hostages by the Germans during their occupation of Norway. Following his arrest he was transferred to Grini concentration camp on 13 January 1942 and given prisoner number 1274, being released on 21 September 1942. His brother John was also arrested and held as a hostage by the Germans. He was decorated with the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1947 and was a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (1952), the Order of the Lion of Finland, the Order of Vasa, the Order of the Polar Star, the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic and the Order of Orange-Nassau.

It is attractive to independent contractors, independent scientists, telecommuting and work-at-home professionals, and people who travel frequently. Additionally, coworking helps workers avoid the feeling of isolation they may experience while telecommuting, traveling, or working at home alone, and eliminate distractions. Most coworking spaces charge membership dues. Types Coworking is not only about providing a physical place, but also about establishing a community. Its rapid growth has been seen as a possible way for city planners to address the decline of high street retail in urban centres. Its benefits can already be experienced outside of the physical spaces, and it is recommended to start with building a coworking community first before considering opening a coworking place. However, some coworking places has no community building; they just get a part of an existing one by combining their opening with an event which attracts their target group. Real-estate centric coworking spaces are about selling desks first, with building community as a secondary goal. Players target freelance professionals, remote workers, and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) who need a space and seek a community with a collaborative spirit. Customers also often benefit from professional services such as printing or incorporation or consulting. Coworking is distinct from business accelerators, incubators, and executive suites. These spaces do not fit into the coworking model because they often miss the social, collaborative, and informal aspects of the process. In coworking, management practices are closer to that of a cooperative, including a focus on community rather than profit. Some coworking participants are also involved in an unconference like BarCamp and other related open-source participatory technology events. History Citizen Space in San Francisco Between 2006 and 2015, a few studies showed that the number of coworking spaces and available seats have roughly doubled each year. Co- Working was first conceptualized by Sunshine Suites. The company opened its doors in October 2001, founded by Cheni Yerushalmi and Joe Raby. From the beginning, the idea of community was central to Sunshine's efforts. It arranged ski trips and upstate hikes and negotiated group discounts on gym memberships, car rentals, and health insurance. Eventually, Sunshine bought a cabin in Vermont for use as a corporate retreat, and started a softball team. \\"It was a lot more than an office space,\\" Yerushalmi recalls. \\"Everybody knew everybody. It was a really special place.\\" If someone fell behind on their payments, for instance, instead of evicting them, the founders worked the phones, drumming up a business to help the struggling company get back on its feet, as the New York Times noted in a profile of the company in 2004. Coworking, as we experience it today, was preceded by European hacker spaces of the 1990s, where programmers would exchange skills and best practices. Some coworking places were developed by nomadic Internet entrepreneurs seeking an alternative to working in coffee shops and cafes, or to isolation in independent or home offices. A 2007 survey showed many employees worry about feeling isolated and losing human interaction if they were to telecommute. Roughly a third of private-sector and public-sector workers also reported that they did not want to stay at home during work. Another major factor that drives demand for coworking is the growing role of independent workers. =In Asia Pacific= Toong's design in Hanoi is a blend of cultural features and modern details. Coworking in Asia has become very popular as space is limited in regions like China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The major metropolitan cities in each of these regions are every day coming up with new coworking ideas and spaces, promoting emerging startups and business to adopt the trend. Research from commercial brokerage firm JLL found that flexible work space in Asia-Pacific, including both serviced offices and coworking, surged 150% from 2014 to 2017. In Pacific countries such as Australia and New Zealand, coworking has been made popular over the last 8 years as the prices of commercial spaces and bills rise, with coworking being up to 25% cheaper for most freelancers and businesses. Coworking space in Makati, the Philippines In Hong Kong for example, dozens of coworking spaces have been set up to foster the rapidly growing startup community; according to Forbes it is among the leading tech locations in the world, along with New York City and Silicon Valley. Spread across almost all districts, coworking places can be found everywhere while the majority of places are situated on Hong Kong Island and there predominantly in the Central and Sheung Wan districts. The Malaysian state of Penang, long regarded as the Silicon Valley of the East, has also witnessed an increase in coworking spaces. Aside from privately owned startups, the Penang state government has embarked on a drive to convert colonial-era buildings in the capital city of George Town into coworking spaces. As well as tech startups, coworking is becoming increasingly common amongst digital nomads in Asia. A 2011 survey found most coworkers are currently in their late twenties to late thirties, with an average age of 34 years. Two-thirds are men, one third are women. Four in five coworkers started their career with a university education. The majority of coworkers work in creative industries or new media. Slightly more than half of all coworkers are freelancers. Coworking spaces in India are also on the rise. According to a 2017 report by real estate firm CBRE, there are 350 shared office operators present in India, like Innov8, wework, 91springboard, VCN coworking, Awfis, Incuspaze, Vatika Business Centre and many more spread across more than 800 locations. Leasing activity by coworking and business center operators more than tripled on 2016. Coworking Space in Melbourne, Australia The Australian market has also continued to grow. Global players such as WeWork and Spaces have entered the market, challenging locally owned and operated companies. With many independent operators opening smaller specialist sites (including in rural and regional areas of the large country), some larger providers have expanded nationwide, with the distance between major cities an asset to both the coworking provider and the community. In India Coworking business is very popular in metro city as Tier 2 and Tier 3 Cities of India. In India during 2017 and 2018 indicates a marked increase. While in 2017, the space leased was 1.9 million sq. ft., it increased more than two times to 3.9 million sq. ft. in 2018. India has the third-largest startup ecosystem after China and the US with more than 5,200 startups. =In Europe= Coworking space in Glasgow, UK In 2017, Europe ranked third as a region in terms of the number of co-working spaces, behind the United States (3,205) and Asia (3,975). France opened its first coworking space in 2008, La Cantine, located in Paris. Nowadays, the U.K. is among the most responsive European country to the idea of collaborative working, with a special focus on London. In the city, the Shoreditch area leads the coworking market, not only for the large number of coworking places it offers but also for the variety of places that exist to fit the differing needs among start-ups, entrepreneurs and freelancers. Camden Collective is a regeneration project in London that re-purposes previously vacant and underused properties that opened its first ‚Äòwire-less, wall-less‚Äô coworking space in 2009.\\"London‚Äôs Camden reinvents itself as hub for emerging businesses\\", Financial Times (paywall). In June 2013, the U.K. Government announced it would be applying coworking principles to a new pilot scheme for its 'One Public Sector Estate' strategy covering 12 local authorities in England, which will encourage councils to work with central government departments and other bodies so that staff share buildings. This will enable the authorities to encourage collaboration as well as re-use or release property and land deemed surplus to requirements, cutting spending and freeing up land for local development. Coworking is also becoming more common in continental Europe, with the startup metropolis Berlin being a major booster for this development. This kind of working environment is not exclusive to big cities. Smaller urban areas with many young and creative people and especially university cities may offer coworking places, with Cowork Greifswald in Germany being one example. Cooperation between coworking spaces and academic environments are focused.deskmag Will Coworking Spaces Be The New Classrooms?, 2013-01-30 =In North America= Since Neuberg started the coworking movement in 2005, San Francisco continues to have a large presence in the coworking community and is home to a growing number of coworking spaces. Also in the Bay Area, Anca Mosoiu established Tech Liminal in 2009, a coworking place in Oakland. The coworking model for office space is extremely popular in Miami. In fact, a 2018 study done by Yardi Matrix, recognized Miami as the US city with most co-working spaces per square foot. Coworking has also spread into many other metropolitan areas, with cities such as Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Toronto, and Wichita, Kansas now offering several coworking venues. The New York coworking community has also been evolving rapidly in places like Regus and Rockefeller Group Business Center. Several new startups like WeWork have been expanding all over the city. The demand for coworking in Brooklyn neighborhoods is high due to the rise in the millennial workforce; nearly one in 10 workers in the Gowanus area work from home. The industrial area of Gowanus is seeing a surge in new startups that are redesigning old buildings into new coworking spaces. In Brooklyn, in 2008, the first green-focused coworking space in the US, called Green Spaces, was founded by Jennie Nevin, and it expanded in 2009 to Manhattan and Denver and has been a driving force for green entrepreneurship through the collaboration of coworking. New models of coworking that go beyond the original concept of shared office space have also been established. For example, CoWorking With Wisdom, in Berkeley, California, combines coworking with meditation, mindfulness, and yoga programs, The Wing was founded for \\"the advancement of a certain type of woman\\", and Work and Play in South Orange, New Jersey has onsite childcare for entrepreneurial parents. Coworking spaces with a religious aspect include Epiphany Space, a Los Angeles space for artists, and SketchPad, a Chicago space for Jewish not-for-profit organizations.

It was discovered on 5 February 1929, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg- K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in Germany. The meaning of the asteroids's name is unknown.  Orbit and classification  Tata is a member of the Hygiea family (), a very large family of carbonaceous outer-belt asteroids. The family's parent body and namesake is the main belt's fourth-largest asteroid, 10 Hygiea. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì3.5 AU once every 5 years and 10 months (2,117 days; semi-major axis of 3.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Simeiz Observatory in March 1925. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in March 1929, one month after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Tata has an ambiguous spectral type, closest to the rare F-types and somewhat similar to the common carbonaceous C-type asteroids. It has also been characterized as a primitive P-type asteroid by the space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). = Rotation period = In July 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Tata was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 8.277 hours with a low brightness amplitude of 0.06 magnitude (), indicative for a spherical shape. The astronomer also reported that several other period solution could be possible. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Tata measures between 61.817 and 74.94 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0378 and 0.0485. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0378 and a diameter of 66.53 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.06.  Naming  Any reference of this minor planet's name to a person or occurrence is unknown. = Unknown meaning = Among the many thousands of named minor planets, Tata is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these asteroids have low numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth (also see category of asteroid names with unknown origin).

MillerCoors was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors to combine their brewing, marketing and sales operations in the United States. The company was acquired by Molson Coors in 2016. In 2019 it was announced that MillerCoors and Molson Coors Canada would be consolidated into a single business unit under the name Molson Coors North America. History =Joint venture with SABMiller= MillerCoors was announced as a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors in October 2007 and was approved by regulators on June 5, 2008. The venture was completed on June 30, 2008 and MillerCoors began operation on July 1, 2008. On September 14, 2015, MillerCoors announced that it would shut down its Eden, North Carolina brewery in September 2016 due to declining corporate sales. The company has newer plants in Virginia and Georgia that will serve the Eden plant's distribution area. In May 2016, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Pabst Brewing Company and Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings filed a lawsuit because Pabst wanted to continue making its beers in Eden. =Sole ownership by Molson Coors= During the merger discussions between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed to the proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller \\"spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S.‚Äîwhich include both Miller- and Coors-held brands‚Äîalong with its Miller brands outside the U.S.\\" The entire ownership situation was complicated: \\"In the United States, Coors is majority owned [58%] by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it's entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller.\\" SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. On October 11, 2016, SABMiller sold its stake in MillerCoors for around US$12 billion after the company was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev, making Molson Coors the 100 percent owner of MillerCoors. Molson Coors also retained \\"the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd's and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell.\\" The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer. =2020 Molson Coors corporate restructuring= On January 1, 2020, Molson Coors Brewing Company changed its name to Molson Coors Beverage Company. This was part of a corporate restructuring that reorganized the company's four business units into Molson Coors North America and Molson Coors Europe and retired the MillerCoors corporate brand name.

Irwell House and the land, known as Drinkwater Park were sold to Salford and Prestwich councils in 1902.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53002 Retrieved 2007-10-11 Irwell House was converted to a smallpox hospital for which it was ideally suited due to its isolated position.

Historical Notes, Godfrey Edition Old Ordnance Survey Map 1907, Lancashire Sheet 96.13: published by Alan Godfrey Maps http://www.alangodfreymaps.co.uk It was later abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 1958 the house caught fire during a civil defence exercise and was demolished some years later. The foundations and the first course of stones were left in place and are still visible today, as are the overgrown remnants of the gardens. The Ordnance Survey map of 1907Godfrey Edition Old Ordnance Survey Map 1907, Lancashire Sheet 96.13: published by Alan Godfrey Maps http://www.alangodfreymaps.co.uk shows Drinkwater Farm located immediately to the west of what is now the northern end of the reservoir and a lodge approximately to the east of the farm, at the end of a narrow arm of the reservoir. However, both these buildings and the stretch of water that joined them have disappeared. For many years there was a sewage farm in the north of the park alongside Buckley Lane but this has now gone leaving only the lines of the walls and some evidence of the lagoons. There is now a pumping station just to the west of the site. Prestwich became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury in 1974.  Flora and fauna  Giant hogweed There are broadleaved trees to be found in the park, as well as native shrubs such as elder, bramble, wild rose and guelder rose. Large swathes of bluebells are to be seen flowering in the spring on the slopes to the east, followed by ferns and bracken in the summer. Species of mosses and fungi are to be found across the park. There are also foreign invaders such as Himalayan balsam and the toxic giant hogweed. Foxes and rabbits are much in evidence and deer are occasionally seen. The wetlands to the east of the reservoir are home to colonies of frogs, and toads also breed in the park. There are waterfowl on the reservoir including coots, moorhens, mallards, swans and occasional flocks of Canada geese. Kingfishers and heron nest in the park as do magpies and species of smaller birds such as tits and finches. Insects abound, especially dragonflies, damselflies and butterflies. The reservoir is stocked with freshwater fish and is home to an array of pondlife such as newts, water boatmen, pondskaters and the endangered freshwater pearl mussel.  Activities  There are well-maintained football pitches in the park with changing rooms and showers near to the Rainsough entrance. Amateur teams play at the weekends including Bury Amateur AFC where hundreds of fans come down on a Saturday afternoon. In October 2003 a skate park was opened near the Rainsough entrance by the mayor and mayoress of Bury. The facility was built as a result of a partnership between Bury Council, youth services, Rainsough Tenants' and Residents' Association, Prestwich Area Board, the police and Community Safety Partnership and the youngsters themselves. The skate park plan was backed by Rainsough TRA who put in a successful bid for funding with the Local Network Fund.Lancashire Evening Telegraph 2003-11-04 Retrieved on 2008-07-26Bury Housing Services - Housing News and Views: Gr8 Sk8 Park!

The mausoleum of M·∫°c C·ª≠u. Buddhism is said to have reached Cambodia through Banteay Meas, brought there by chance when a ship carrying Buddhaghosa was blown there by a storm in 415 AD. Buddhaghosa had with him the famous Emerald Buddha statue, for many centuries thereafter a state treasure of Cambodia and later Laos, until it was carried away by Thai invaders to be placed at its present location in the Wat Phra Kaew in Bangkok. Cancao was established by a group of a few Hoa people, mostly men who helped the Ming dynasty and were opposed to the Qing dynasty, led by M·∫°c K√≠nh C·ª≠u. When they arrived in Nam H√†, the Nguy·ªÖn-ph∆∞·ªõc rulers ordered the king of Cambodia (then a vassal state of Nam H√†) to grant land to these Hoa people, and made an active business town. Cochinchinese people gradually arrived there. This town later was merged into Quangnamese territory when M·∫°c K√≠nh C·ª≠u confirmed its sovereignty to the Nguy·ªÖn-ph∆∞·ªõc rulers and he then obtained the title of ruler. The capital was at the time H√† Ti√™n (Ê≤≥ÂÉä / River Fairy ; international Athien), referring to the guardian deity of the Giang-th√†nh river (Ê±üÂüéÊ≤≥), given by ruler Nguy·ªÖn Ph∆∞·ªõc Ch√¢u.Introduction of Ha- tien In Mok clan's territory there were 7 casinos : M√°ng-kh·∫£m (H√† Ti√™n), L≈©ng- k·ª≥ (Prey Nob District), C·∫ßn-b·ªôt (Kampot Province), H∆∞∆°ng-√∫c (Kompong Som), S√†i-m·∫°t (Banteay Meas District), Linh-qu·ª≥nh (Kiri Vong) and Ph√∫-qu·ªëc (Koh Tral).

In the high (dry) season they run more frequently, with up to 3 fast boats (Superdong) each making up to 3 crossings every day. The trip takes about 80-90 minutes. There are also now 4 car ferries operating from H√† Ti√™n to the north east corner of the island at Bai Thom. These run on demand, not to a fixed schedule and can start as early as 05:00 and run until 21:00. This takes about 2.5 hours. =Border crossing= A road border crossing between Vietnam and Cambodia, called the H√† Ti√™n International Border Gate, is located 7 km west of H√† Ti√™n in the village of X√† X√≠a. On the Cambodian side, the border crossing is known as the Prek Chak International Border Checkpoint in Kampong Trach District, Kampot. The border crossing was opened in 2007. It is open from 07:00 to 18:00. Besides conventional Vietnamese visas, this border crossing is also listed as a Vietnamese e-Visa point of entry for foreigners.

The cough center is located in the medulla oblongata in the brainstem. Cough suppressants focus their action on the cough center.D.C. Bolser. Central Mechanisms II: Pharmacology of Brainstem Pathways. Handb Exp Pharmacol. 2009; (187): 203‚Äì217. Structure The exact location and functionality of the cough center has remained somewhat elusive: while Johannes Peter M√ºller observed in 1838 that the medulla coordinates the cough reflex, investigating it has been slow because the usual anaesthetics for experimental animals were morphine or opiates, drugs which strongly inhibit cough. In addition, the center likely overlaps with the respiratory rhythm generator networks.J.G. Widdicombe, Neurophysiology of the Cough Reflex, Eur Respir J, 1995, 8, 1193‚Äì1202 It is hence not so much a specific area, but a function within the respiration and reflex networks of the brainstem. Cough receptors project to relay neurones in the solitary nucleus, which project to other parts of the respiratory networks. In particular, the pre-B√∂tzinger complex may act as a pattern generator for the cough response. Parts of the caudal medullary raphe nucleus (nucleus raphe obscurus and nucleus raphe magnus) are known to be essential for the cough response. Other systems that may be involved in pattern generation and regulation are the pontine respiratory group, the lateral tegmental field and the deep cerebellar nuclei.R. Shannon, D.M. Baekey, K.F.

The stony S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 97.4 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was discovered at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula on 10 August 1928, by astronomer Soviet Grigory Neujmin, who named it after his son, Jaroslav Grigorevich Neujmin (born 1928).  Orbit and classification  Jaroslawa is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,207 days; semi-major axis of 2.22 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory in March 1917. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Simeiz in August 1928.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Jaroslav Grigorevich Neujmin (born 1928), son of the discoverer Grigory Neujmin. The author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names leaned about the naming from Ilya Isaakovich Neyachenko and Nikolai Chernykh after whom the asteroids 3845 Neyachenko and 2325 Chernykh were named.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Jaroslawa is a common, stony S-type asteroid, while it has been characterized as an uncommon L-type asteroid by PanSTARRS photometric survey. = Rotation period = In January 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Jaroslawa was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Maurice Clark at Preston Gott Observatory in Lubbock, Texas. Lightcurve analysis gave a long rotation period of 94.432 hours and a high brightness variation of 0.80 magnitude (). In October 2014, Frederick Pilcher at the Organ Mesa Observatory in New Mexico, in collaboration with astronomers at Etscorn and Bigmuskie observatories, obtained a refined period of 97.4 hours with an amplitude of magnitude (). This result supersedes other measurements by Maurice Clark, Nicolas Esseiva, Raoul Behrend, Laurent Bernasconi, Jean-Gabriel Bosch and Josep Coloma. While not being a core slow rotator, with periods above 100 hours, Jaroslawa has a significantly longer period than most minor planets, which typically rotate between 2 and 20 hours once around their axes. = Spin axis and shape = In 2016, a modeled lightcurve using photometric data from various sources was published. It gave a concurring period of 97.278 hours, as well as a spin axis of (236.0¬∞, 75.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤).

It lies on the western boundary of the county, bordering County Tyrone to its west and County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland to its south. It is bordered by three other baronies in Northern Ireland: Dungannon Lower and Dungannon Upper to the north-west; and Armagh to the east. It also borders two baronies in the Republic of Ireland; Cremorne to the south and Trough to the west. Etymology The name Tiranny is a softened form of Toughranie, an anglicisation of Tuath Threana. The form Tiranny was created by the Ordnance Survey and led to the incorrect conjecture by some such as John O'Donovan that the first element of the name derived from the Irish word t√≠r, meaning \\"country\\". Older phonetic forms of Tuatha Threna included Toaghrany, Toyghrayny, Toaghraine, Toaghranye, Towrany, Tuterany, Toghrany, Toorany, Turrany, and Torany, all of which are found in records from the early seventeenth century. The second element Threna is derived from the U√≠ Threna (), the name of a tribe that settled on the western boundaries of modern County Armagh, where the barony of Tiranny is located. In various Elizabethan maps of Ulster, they are recorded in the anglicised forms of O'Traney, O'Trany, Outraine, and Traney, before the term Tuath Threana was used. History The U√≠ Threna were descended from Trena, the great-grandson of Colla Fo Chr√≠, one of the Three Collas, and where part of the over-kingdom of Airg√≠alla. In the north-east of Tiranny, south of the River Blackwater there was a sub-territory called Clanaul, the original name of the parish of Eglish. The name is preserved in the form Glenaul which was used as the name for the local District Electoral Division of the former Armagh Poor Law Union. The name derives from the Irish Cluain Dabhail, which means \\"meadow of Dabhal\\", noted as the ancient name of the River Blackwater. Clanaul is also recorded as Clandavle, and in the Tynan Charter of 1455 as Clondowyll. To the east of Tiranny lay the territory of Tuath Echach (), anglicised as Tooaghy, now the barony of Armagh. It takes its name from the U√≠ Echach (), whose ancestor Echach was the brother of Trena the ancestor of the U√≠ Threna. They are also recorded as the U√≠ Eochaidh.

Formerly endemic to Cuba, this huge bird of prey probably fed on Pleistocene megafauna. Little is known about its appearance and ecology, so no common name has been given. Because of its eagle-like size, it was originally assigned to Aquila borrasi. In 1982 the new binomial name Titanohierax borrasi was suggested; Aquila borrasi was found valid again in 2004. A 2007 study earned it its current classification and found close similarities to the extant great black hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga). Description Great black hawk (Buteogallus urubutinga), closest relative of B. borrasi The latest scientific research describes B. borrasi as very similar to its extant relative, the great black hawk (B. urubitinga). However, it was one third as big again as that bird. Compared to other large birds of prey that shared its habitat‚ÄîWoodward's eagle, Titanohierax and Gigantohierax‚Äîit had relatively gracile features. History Oscar Arredondo described B. borrasi in 1970, based on finds from Western Cuba: an incomplete left tarsometatarsus (the holotype), a fragmentary right femur and some phalanges. In 1982 Storrs L. Olson and William Hilgartner examined the holotype and, finding it dissimilar to Aquila tarsometatarsi, suggested it be referred to Titanohierax gloveralleni. In 1999, Arredondo realized the femur and one of the phalanges did not belong to B. borrasi, and assigned them to the new species Gigantohierax suarezi. In 2004, William Su√°rez concluded that the species was valid but could not be referred to the genus Titanohierax. Meanwhile, a considerable amount of new fossil material was being discovered. Olson and Su√°rez reassigned the bird to Buteogallus in 2007. They found the tarsometatarsus and tibiotarsus far too slender and elongate for an Aquila eagle, but very similar to those of the great black hawk (B. urubitinga). Some mismatches were attributed to the size difference between the two species. Paleoecology Fossil remains of B. borrasi are known only from Cuba. However, it has been postulated to have roam the wider West Indies and perhaps even mainland North America. It is the most common fossil accipitrid in Quaternary deposits of Cuba, notably at Llanura Meridional de La Habana. These deposits are thought to be from a savanna environment. The shape of the tarsus suggests a bird that hunts on the wing, and the mammalian fauna of the time suggests a diet of small- to medium-sized rodents and insectivora, which may have been supplemented with reptiles in open areas. Olson suggests two possible origins for B. borrasi: either it diverged from B. urubitinga in Cuba, or it evolved on the mainland and eventually became extinct there, leaving a relict population in Cuba. In culture Buteogallus borrasi (under the synonym Aquila borrasi) is featured on a 1982 Cuban postage stamp, part of a series on prehistoric animals. However, the illustration‚Äîderivative of a work by Arthur B. Singer‚Äîactually depicts an ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus).

The process allows parties to have a fair settlement. The voluntary process is initiated when the couple signs a contract (a \\"participation agreement\\") binding each other to the process and disqualifying their respective lawyer's right to represent either one in any future family-related litigation. The collaborative process can be used to facilitate a broad range of other family issues, including disputes between parents and the drawing up of pre and post- marital contracts. As the traditional method of drawing up pre-marital contracts is oppositional, many couples prefer to begin their married life with documents drawn up consensually and mutually. Collaborative law processes also have the added benefit of being cost efficient for the involved parties. As the necessary tasks in the collaborative model are assigned to specialist professionals without duplication of effort, cost savings are realized. These cost efficiencies, in addition to other potential benefits, have led parties in other contexts to explore the use of collaborative law to resolve disputes, including M&A; transactions. History This approach to conflict resolution was created in 1990 by Minnesota family lawyer Stuart Webb, who saw that traditional litigation was not always helpful to parties and their families, and often was damaging. Since 1990, the Collaborative Law movement has spread rapidly to most of the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Per the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals (\\"IACP\\"), more than 22,000 lawyers have been trained in Collaborative Law worldwide, with collaborative practitioners in at least 46 states. In some localities, Collaborative Law has become the predominant method for resolving divorce, co- habitation and other family disputes. More than 1,250 lawyers have completed their training in England where collaborative law was launched in 2003. The Collaborative Law movement has spread rapidly to most of the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia., More than 22,000 lawyers have been trained in Collaborative Law worldwide and more than 1,250 lawyers have completed their training in England and Wales where Collaborative Law was launched in 2003. The growth of the collaborative process in England and Wales has been encouraged by both the judiciary and the family lawyers organisation, Resolution. In an address to London family lawyers in October 2009, the newly appointed Supreme Court Justice, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore became the first member of the Supreme Court to publicly endorse Collaborative Law and called for its extension to other areas. Previously, in October 2008 the Hon. Mr Justice Coleridge, a High Court Judge of the Family Division, had promised that collaborative agreements would be fast tracked in the High Court of England and Wales. On 29 November 2011, speaking at a reception hosted by the group, Collaborative Family Law, Supreme Court Justice Lord Wilson of Culworth reaffirmed his commitment to Collaborative Law and other Family Dispute Resolution Services whilst criticising the Government's plans to cut legal aid, which he called a \\"false economy\\". Organizations The primary global collaborative organisation is the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals (IACP), which was founded in the late 1990s by a group of northern California lawyers, psychotherapists, and financial planners. IACP has more than 2,400 members and there are more than 200 practice groups of collaborative practitioners worldwide. The IACP offers an opportunity for education and networking for its members as well provides a resource for research on collaborative divorce. The American Bar Association (\\"ABA\\"), the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and the International Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (\\"IAML\\") all have Collaborative Law committees. IACP is an interdisciplinary organisation whose members include lawyers, mental health professionals and financial specialists. National Collaborative organisations have been established in many jurisdictions around the world, including Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Israel, Hong Kong, Kenya, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Switzerland, and Uganda, as well as the United States. There is an active on-line collaborative community on Be-fulfilled.org. In England and Wales, Resolution, has assumed responsibility for the training and accreditation of all collaborative professionals. Almost one-third of all English family lawyers have now completed their collaborative training. In the Republic of Ireland regional collaborative law associations have been set up in cities such as Galway, Cork, Obtaining Mechanic's Liens and Dublin. In France the AFPDC was created in 2009 to develop and implement collaborative practice in France. A number of states in the United States have their own individual organizations for collaborative law practitioners, including Collaborative Practice California, the Collaborative Family Law Council of Florida, Collaborative Law Institute of Georgia, the Collaborative Law Institute of Illinois, the Collaborative Law Institute of Minnesota, the Collaborative Law Institute of North Carolina, Collaborative Divorce Texas and the Massachusetts Collaborative Law Council, and the Washington DC Academy of Collaborative Professionals. Further, most metropolitan areas, such as San Diego, Los Angeles, Tampa, Dallas, Raleigh, Cleveland, St. Louis and Chicago have local collaborative practice groups. Uniform Collaborative Law Act In the United States, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was adopted in 2009 by the Uniform Law Commission, and thereby became available to the individual States to enact as law. In 2010, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was amended to add several options and renamed the Uniform Collaborative Law Rules and Act. As of June 2013, the Uniform Collaborative Law Act was enacted into law in the states of Utah, Nevada, Texas, Hawaii, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and Washington State, and passed by the Alabama Legislature but awaiting the Governor's signature, and was pending enactment in several additional U.S. states. In Texas, Houston-based family lawyer Harry Tindall has been instrumental in securing passage of the UCLA by the Texas Legislature. On 24 March 2016, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed the Collaborative Law Process Act, Florida's version of the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, which creates a statutory privilege that makes confidential communications had during the collaborative process. The Overview to the Act provides a comprehensive and reliable history of the emergence of collaborative law in the United States. In some states, like Florida, which were waiting on the passage of the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, local judges had been teaming up with collaborative professionals and creating local rules and administrative orders endorsing and regulating collaborative law.

It was discovered on 11 February 1927, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The F-type asteroid (FX) has a short rotation period of 4.02 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was later named in honor of Karl Reinmuth, the discoverer himself.  Orbit and classification  Reinmuthia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,891 days; semi-major axis of 2.99 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg with its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after its discoverer, Karl Reinmuth (1892‚Äì1979), a German astronomer at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory and a prolific discoverer of minor planets. In total, he discovered 395 asteroids, most of them during the 1920s and 1930s, which was a unique record for many years. His discoveries include 1862 Apollo and 69230 Hermes, two lost asteroids and near- Earth objects as well as several large Jupiter trojans. His 1931-discovered asteroid (11435) 1931 UB is the oldest discovered yet still unnamed asteroid. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  Lightcurve-based 3D inversion model of Reinmuthia In the Tholen classification, Reinmuthia has an ambiguous spectral type, closest to that of a dark F-type and somewhat similar to an X-type asteroid. The spectrum had also been flagged as \\"unusual\\" and \\"nosy\\" by Tholen (FXU:). = Rotation period = Rotational lightcurves of Reinmuthia have been obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Richard Binzel as well as by Hiromi and Hiroko Hamanowa at the Hamanowa Astronomical Observatory in Japan (). Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated, well-defined rotation period of 4.02 hours with a high brightness amplitude between 0.61 and 0.95 magnitude (). = Poles and shape = Lightcurve inversion also modeled the body's shape and poles. In 2013, modelling by an international study using photometric data from the US Naval Observatory, the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalogue, the Palomar Transient Factory and the Catalina Sky Survey gave a similar sidereal period of 4.007347 hours and two spin axes of (356.0¬∞, 68.0¬∞) and (153.0¬∞, 78.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates (Œª, Œ≤). The body's very elongated shape had already been indicated by the high brightness variation measured during the photometric observations. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, Reinmuthia measures 24.38 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.167. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 41.26 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.65.

Germany imports most of its materials and energy sources, and in 2004 imported 2.135 million barrels of oil and 85.02 billion m¬≥ (2003) of natural gas a day. In 2004, Germany emitted 886 million metric tonnes of CO2. In 2004, there were approximately 45 million registered cars in Germany. Between March 1998 and March 1999, 84 countries including Germany signed the Kyoto Protocol. In March 2002, the Bundestag unanimously ratified Kyoto. In May 2002, the European Union submitted the articles of ratification for all 15 of its then member states. As an Annex II nation, Germany's commitment to the UNFCCC with respect to Kyoto was to reduce emissions as well as to provide an economic crutch to developing nations via Clean Development Mechanisms. In November 2006, Germany's planned annual quota was 482 million metric tonnes of CO2. German Greenhouse Gas Emissions reduced by 17.2% from 1990 to 2004, according to UNFCCC. Germany actively promotes government carbon funds and supports multilateral carbon funds that are intent on purchasing Carbon Credits from non-Annex I parties. Government organizations work closely with major utility, energy, oil and gas, and chemicals conglomerates to try to acquire as many Greenhouse Gas Certificates as cheaply as possible. Since signing and ratifying the protocol, Germany has committed to reducing its emissions to 21% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. In November 2008, a study found that Germany had already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 22.4%, which means it already reached its Kyoto Emissions Commitments.Spiegel online Some of Germany's achievements since signing the protocol * So far Germany has reduced CO2 emissions by 22.4%. * Germany has topped world production in wind energy with more than 16,000 wind turbines, which generate 39% of the world's total wind power. * Germany played a key role in installing 64% of the solar energy generation capacity in 2003. Germany has also signed a climate change agreement alongside Israel, Jordan, and Egypt. This agreement is designed to make it easier and cheaper for industrialized countries such as Germany to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the protocol. Next steps * Germany plans to generate 20% of its energy from renewable energy sources by 2020.http://www.bmu.de/english/current_press_releases/pm/46293.php References External links *Germany Info *Un Foundation Category:Climate change in Germany ","title":"German response to Kyoto Protocol"},{"id":"13648320","text":"simple:Consternation ","title":"Consternation"},{"id":"13648321","text":"USS John Griffith (1861) was a mortar schooner acquired by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was used for various purposes, but, especially for bombardment because of her large 13-inch mortar and 12-pounder howitzers that could fire up and over tall defensive riverbanks. John Griffith was purchased by the Navy at New York City from B. P. Woolsey 16 September 1861; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard 20 January 1862, Lt. K. Randolph Breese in command.  Assigned to Mississippi River operations  The schooner was ordered to Key West, Florida, to join the Mortar Flotilla being organized by Comdr. David D. Porter for the decisive attack up the Mississippi River. The flotilla sailed from Key West 6 March and on 11 March anchored at Ship Island, Mississippi, the staging area for Flag Officer David Farragut's New Orleans, Louisiana, campaign. A week later John Griffith was towed across the bar at Pass a l'Outre with Porter's other mortar schooners. For the next month, while Farragut labored to move his deep-draft, sea-going ships across the bar and into the Mississippi, Porter's vessels drilled and prepared for the fight awaiting them.  Attack on Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip  The mortar boats moved into terminal position 18 April and opened fire on Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. John Griffith, now under Acting Master Henry Brown, was in the 3rd Division commanded by her old skipper, Lt. Breese, who placed his schooners along the western bank of the river just below the lower limit of Fort Jackson's fire. John Griffith pressed the attack with great vigor, leading the ships of her division on 4 days of the weeklong bombardment which continued until Farragut had succeeded in fighting his mighty fleet past the forts to capture New Orleans in one of the war's most daring and strategically significant operations. This bold stroke deprived the South of her largest and wealthiest city, tightened the Union blockade, and gave promise of restoring the entire Mississippi Valley to the Union. When he was barely beyond the forts, Farragut paused to bury his dead, repair his ships, and dash off a note of thanks to Porter for the help of the mortars: \\"You supported us most nobly.\\"  Moving up the river: attack on Vicksburg  John Griffith's next major operation came on Farragut's second passage up the Mississippi River. The mortars rained their 8-inch shells on the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi, while the heavy ships steamed by the forts to meet Flag Officer Davis and his Mississippi Flotilla. The schooners then waited for Farragut below Vicksburg, occasionally enlivening their vigil by hurling a few shells at the forts. On 15 July they resumed the bombardment in earnest when the sound of heavy firing announced Farragut's approach.  Reassigned to the South Atlantic Blockade  John Griffith continued to serve the West Gulf Blockading Squadron until ordered north 18 May 1864. The schooner decommissioned for repairs 1 June and she re-commissioned 23 August 1864. The following day she received orders to sail to Port Royal, South Carolina, for service in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She arrived Port Royal 8 September and served on blockade duty and at the mouth of the Altamaha River, Georgia, until ordered 12 December to the Savannah River, where General William Tecumseh Sherman had just emerged at the end of his famous march to the sea. Five days later John Griffith shelled Fort Beaulieu, the Confederate fortress defending the mouths of the Vernon and Burnside Rivers. With she maintained her steady and deliberate fire until the defenders finally evacuated 21 December.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale  Thereafter John Griffith remained on blockade duty until after the end of the war. She decommissioned 21 August 1865 and was sold at public auction at Boston Navy Yard to C. Foster 8 September 1865.
