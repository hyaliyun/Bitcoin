Corruption within Mexico is spurred on by high unemployment rates, low and stagnating wages, and the widespread prevalence of drug trafficking. History of Corruption Corruption in Mexico has its roots in colonial times. With the arrival of conquistadors, the Spanish crown began assigning offices of power to certain wealthy and influential people . These offices were often short-lived because officials were charged with collecting revenue, maintaining order, and sustaining their regions while relying on only local sources of wealth and sustenance. People began to learn how to manipulate their local political leaders and would hold fiestas to gain favor with political leaders. This system of bribery and purchasing one's way into power and influence continued into post-colonial times, where the Mexican society organized itself into a pyramid-like hierarchy with the rich and powerful at the top . After independence, corruption was used not only as a means of advancement but also as a means to provide goods and services . In this way, corruption became a method for lowly-paid bureaucrats to raise revenue in order to boost infrastructural and social projects as well as supplement incomes. Causes of Corruption in Mexico =Social Advancement and Economic Survival= Some corruption exists as a means to either boost ones standing in the local community or to supplement the extremely low incomes that most of the Mexican population receive. Many Mexican officials use corruption to either boost their social influence or to boost their income. Corruption can also be caused by a desire to manipulate and influence other people. Corruption in the Police Corruption in the Mexican police can take many forms; it ranges from taking bribes to ignore crimes to active participation in criminal activity such as extortion, drug-trafficking, and assassination. The Mexican police are notorious for their corruption that is evident on all levels of law- enforcement, local and federal. Some Mexican police officers enter law- enforcement not because of a genuine interest in policing but because of ulterior motives. Some join to escape criminal pasts in other states, others join to earn some money before moving onto other business ventures, while others join to increase their criminal networks, allowing them to boost drug and crime spread, connections, and distribution. Effects of Police Corruption There are several resulting effects of widespread police corruption. Over 92% of crimes go unreported or are not investigated according to Mexico‚Äôs 2012 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Security. Many Mexican citizens do not feel safe and protected by the police tasked with their safety and protection. 43% of Mexican citizens believe that corruption is the main obstacle facing successful law-enforcement. Many people have reported bribing the police, even for minor incidents such as illegal parking and other traffic violations. Mexico's business officials have noted that police corruption has had a severely negative influence on business and economic progress. Police corruption is also, in part, to blame for the continued spread of illicit narcotics and the growth of the drug manufacturing and distribution industries. Efforts to Stop Corruption The Mexican government claims to have taken many steps to combat corruption. Despite these efforts, even when individual cases of corruption are reported, the matter is seldom investigated and almost never prosecuted.

Plot Datak (Tony Curran) wakes up to find Jalina (Kelly McCormack), the Tarr's hand-maiden and who he spent the night with, dead on his doorstep with her eyes missing. Datak calls Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) to help him find out what happened and to get rid of the body. Yewll does not want to help him though since she does not want to end up in prison again and she leaves him alone. Datak is afraid that they will blame him for the murder and he does not want to report it to Nolan (Grant Bowler), so he calls Rafe (Graham Greene) for help. Rafe helps him to transfer the body to a hellbug area to be eaten and then they both start to search for Jalina's murderer. Stahma (Jaime Murray) worries about Jalina who did not come home and reports her disappearance to Nolan. Nolan thinks that the disappearance is the same as Bertie's few days before and tells her that probably Jalina will be back in few days. Datak informs Stahma later about Jalina's death and they agree to find who is responsible without involving the lawkeeper while Nolan asks Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) if she has anything to do with this. Irisa tries to induce visions of the man she saw on the Votan ship by hurting herself since the wound will heal. She draws the man's face when Rynn (Tiio Horn) interrupts her to ask her help finding Sukar who is missing. Rynn sees the sketch of the man and tells Irisa that this man is Cai (Robin Dunne) and he is with her in Defiance. Irisa insists on meeting him and when Rynn introduces her to him and Irisa asks him if he recognizes her, Cai says he has never seen her before. Yewll gets a lead of who might be responsible for Jalina's death when Professor Lambert (Gilles Savard) comes to her office for eye drops and she calls Datak.

At the same time, Rynn goes missing and Cai tells Irisa who goes straight to Nolan. The two of them go to Yewll who tells them about what is happening and gives them the names of other surgeon doctors in Defiance to investigate them. While Dr. Scheck is ready to remove Rynn's second eye, Nolan and Irisa show up and stop him. Scheck manages to stab Irisa on the shoulder and runs away, only to run into Datak and Rafe who were coming to his office. Datak removes Scheck's eyes with his bare hands before Nolan gets there. Irisa follows Nolan who can see that her wound is totally healed. Later, Irisa has a last encounter with Cai where she kisses him to show him her visions from the Votan ship.

On May 10, Duffy hit a walk-off, bases-loaded single in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Miami Marlins 3‚Äì2. On May 12, Duffy set new career highs with 3 hits and 5 RBIs, helping the Giants to an 8‚Äì1 victory over the Houston Astros. Duffy was the first Giants rookie to collect 5 RBIs in a game since Buster Posey on July 7, 2010. As a utility infielder, Duffy played all four infield positions during April and May, but he primarily played at third base as regular starter Casey McGehee struggled.

With the Rays in 2016 he batted .276/.300/.355. The original plan for the 2017 season was for Duffy to start the season at shortstop, assuming his Achilles would heal at the expected rate. But due to complications in the rehabilitation process, Duffy was placed on the 60-Day DL. Duffy came as close as a rehab stint to playing again in 2017, but more complications arose, drawing more setbacks. Duffy and the Rays organization expressed their frustrations with the rehabilitation process but still remained optimistic that he would appear in the 2017 season. Complications continued, however, and Duffy never made any appearance in a game in 2017. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, Duffy joined the instructional and winter league Rays' affiliates with hopes to build momentum into 2018.

Under his direction, the Journal was praised by Allen Ginsberg for \\"its presentation of literary history hitherto kept in the closet by the academies.\\" In 1975, Leyland founded Gay Sunshine Press, the oldest LGBT publishing house in the United States, followed by Leyland Publications in 1984. The two imprints combined have published more than 135 books, and are known for their translations of gay-themed European and Asian literature into English, including works by Vladimir Makanin, Yukio Mishima, and Nikolai Gogol. Leyland also published written erotica, such as Mike Shearer's Great American Gay Porno Novel and collections of reader-supplied true sexual stories edited by Boyd McDonald (Meat, Flesh, Sex, Cum, Juice, Wads and Cream).

Britton, Oklahoma, founded in 1889, bears the name of Washington D.C. railroad attorney, Alexander Britton, who worked for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As part of its charter allowing a railroad to be built through Oklahoma, the United States required the construction of railway stations every seven miles. The first site north of Oklahoma City became the town of Britton. Notably, Britton's altitude is 1,220 feet above sea level and is the highest point on the Santa Fe Railroad between Kansas City, Missouri and Galveston, Texas. Through the efforts of Oklahoma City developers Anton Classen and John Shartel, Britton was connected in 1910 to Oklahoma City through the Oklahoma Railway Company's Interurban, which ran on north to Guthrie, Oklahoma. During its early years, the town thrived and was home to two movies theaters, gas stations, a drug store, a lumberyard, medical clinics and retail businesses. Before its annexation by Oklahoma City in 1950, Britton's main street offered a shopping point for its 6,000 residents. Between March 3, 1936 and March 2, 1953, Route 66 passed directly through downtown Britton and was the major conduit through which Route 66 travelers made their way through Oklahoma City on route to Illinois and California. The Owl Courts motel, one of Oklahoma City's oldest surviving 1930's era Route 66 motels, was built in the former town of Britton.

History In 1962 Bishop Vincent Waters of Raleigh instructed for the Diocese to purchase the former Jefferson Presbyterian Church building on Main Street, which had been built in 1899, for $12,000 in order to create a new church for the growing Catholic community in Ashe County. The formal dedication ceremony for St. Francis Church was held on August 27, 1963. The parish began as a mission of Saint Elizabeth of the Hill Country Catholic Church of Boone, North Carolina. In the 1970s additions were made to the church building. On September 25, 1985, Bishop John F. Donoghue of Charlotte dedicated the new hall of the church. In 1990, a house next to the church was purchased and converted into a rectory. In September 1994, renovation work on the church was completed, including a new main altar, blessed sacrament table, and stained glass windows which were all made by parishioners. St. Francis of Rome Catholic Church in Sparta, North Carolina is a mission of St. Francis of Assisi Church. By 2014 St. Francis, still the only Catholic church in the county, had 277 families and had outgrown the 1899 building. It built a new church on a 15 acre site on Luther Road; Father James Stuhrenberg expressed regret about leaving the Main St church. Bishop Peter Joseph Jugis and Congresswoman Virginia Foxx attended the September 29, 2012, groundbreaking. St. Francis has been active in assisting needy migrant workers who began coming to the County in the late 20th century as seasonal laborers in the Christmas tree farms, and became permanent residents in growing numbers over the decades.

Here, he was entrusted with processing ancient marble sculptures, a main theme of his future research.Schrader, Hans (eigentlich Johann Herrmann) @ NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie In 1896, under the leadership of Carl Humann, he began excavatory work at Priene (Asia Minor). Here, he worked alongside Theodor Wiegand. After Humann's death later the same year, he continued work at Priene up until 1899. From 1899 to 1901 he worked as an assistant director of Berlin museums, afterwards serving as second secretary of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens (1901‚Äì05). In 1905 he was appointed professor of classical archaeology at the University of Innsbruck, followed by professorships at the Universities of Graz (from 1908) and Vienna (from 1910). At Vienna he was also in charge of the collection of antiquities. In 1914 he accepted a professorial post at the newly established University of Frankfurt.

As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution. Alberta's constitution, like the UK's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates. Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list. The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a \\"definitive list\\". However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada. As part of the Canadian federation, Alberta, like all of the provinces, is bound by the terms of the Constitution of Canada; this includes rules concerning the division of powers between the federal order of government and the provinces, as well as the rights of individuals vis-a-vis the state. The legislature of the province can only legislate on topics delegated to the provinces under Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and since 1982 it is further bound by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in both instances being subject to judicial review. At the time that Alberta was created, the basics of its structure were set out in a statute passed by the federal parliament, the Alberta Act (1905). This is considered a Canadian constitutional document and is listed as such in the appendix to the Constitution Act, 1982. Nevertheless, Alberta has always had the power to change its own internal composition without the approval of the federal parliament (within limits), and has done so on many occasions. For example Alberta has at various times had both a first-past-the-post and a mixed member electoral system. Since 1982, provinces have had the option of making some laws explicitly part of their constitution under a formula contained within the Constitution of Canada. Alberta has done this only once to date. The Constitution of Alberta Amendment Act, 1990 enshrines the existence of M√©tis settlements in Alberta and provides a guarantee that they will not be abolished without the consent of the M√©tis people in Alberta. \\"The constitution of Alberta, which, in the British tradition, is unwritten, was amended to provide constitutional recognition for the changes.

Shortly after his retirement from the forces, he proceeded to campaign \\"for the creation of an effective striking force and for a proper regard for the patent realities of civil aviation\\". His opinions attracted the interest of Viscount Northcliffe and in 1922 a series of articles on \\"Our Future in the Air\\" were published in The Times.

Life Coaches outside the White Hart Inn in Bath (demolished 1869) Pickwick's grandfather, Moses, was a foundling who was discovered in an area of Corsham known as Pickwick. This Pickwick was baptised in February 1748 or 1749. He started a coaching business that came to be based at The White Hart inn opposite the iconic Pump Room. Pickwick's nephew, Moses Pickwick, managed the inn. In 1794 Pickwick was on the board of the company that was created by the Somerset Coal Canal. Pickwick invested tens of thousands of pounds in the canal business after its bankers refused to lend any more capital. Pickwick bought Bathford Manor House in 1798. Pickwick died in Bath in 1837 and was buried in Bathford. Legacy The White Hart inn was demolished in 1869 but the sign was resused on another inn. There is a plaque that records the location of the inn and the Pickwicks on the corner of Stall Street and Westgate Street in Bath. The coaching business continued on very successfully under the ownership of Moses Pickwick. From the 1830s business reduced as the railways grew in importance. It is widely believed that Dickens wrote The Pickwick Papers after visiting Bath using the surname he had seen there. His inn is also mentioned in the works of Jane Austen. Eleazer Pickwick's nephew, Reverend Charles Pickwick (1803-1834), descendants changed their name to Sainsbury. It has been speculated that part of the motive may have been to discard their lowly born ancestry, favoring their mothers (Harriet Sarah Sainsbury) prestigious line; and Dicken's caricatures that bore their name.Brenda J.

The siege began in 1440 and lasted until the capture of the fortress on 27 June 1441. During the siege, the Serbian garrison was supported by the local community of citizens of the Republic of Ragusa.  Background  Novo Brdo was one of the largest cities in the Balkans, and because of its rich gold and silver mines it was the most important non-coastal city in the Balkans in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Ottomans besieged it without success in 1412 and in 1427 using cannons they'd constructed for the 1422 siege of Constantinople. In 1439 Ottoman forces led by Sultan Murad II attacked the Serbian Despotate. Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá fled to Hungary to seek support for the defense of his realm, organized by his son Grgur. During the siege of Smederevo (the Despotate's capital city) in 1439, Murad II ordered the marcher-lord Ishak-Beg, who was returning from Mecca, to join forces with Hadƒ±m ≈ûehabeddin and besiege Novo Brdo. On 6 August 1439 the Ottoman forces under Ishak-Beg defeated Serbian forces near Novo Brdo. The Ottomans captured Smederevo on 18 August 1439, reducing the territory of the Serbian Despotate to Zeta and a region around Novo Brdo. The forces under Murad II joined Ishak-Beg to attack Novo Brdo, but its garrison successfully repelled their attacks. The Ottomans realized that it would be difficult to capture the well-defended Novo Brdo, so Murad II ordered for retreat and a stay in Skopje during the winter. Before they did so, they robbed caravans of Ragusan merchants, while Murad II went to Adrianople. The Ottomans allowed Grgur Brankoviƒá to govern his father's former estates in southern Serbia, as an Ottoman vassal.  Siege  The layout of the Novo Brdo Fortress In 1440, after the failure at Belgrade, the Ottoman forces commanded by the beylerbey (the Lord of Lords) of Rumelia Eyalet, Hadƒ±m ≈ûehabeddin, again besieged Novo Brdo. The garrisoned Serbian forces were also supported by citizens of the Republic of Ragusa, Ragusa having instructed their subjects in Novo Brdo to help defend the town. Ragusans, who were predominantly merchants, were practically forced to resist the Ottomans because otherwise their property in Novo Brdo would be confiscated, like it was in the case of Ragusan merchants who happened to be outside of the town when the siege began and refused to return to it. Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and his wife traveled from Hungary to Zeta, accompanied with several hundred cavalry and vojvoda Petar Spani. They first went to Zagreb, to ƒêuraƒë's sister Katarina who was the wife of Ulrich II, Count of Celje. Then Brankoviƒá arrived at Ragusa (Dubrovnik) at the end of July 1440 and after several days he continued his journey toward his coastal towns of Budva and Bar which became the new capital of the remaining part of his despotate. In the period between 1 July 1440 and his arrival at Bar, the Ottoman forces defeated some military units from Novo Brdo in a battle near Makre≈° (a village near modern-day Gnjilane). In August 1440 Brankoviƒá arrived at Bar where he stayed until the end of the winter 1440‚Äì41. There he tried to mobilize forces to recapture the territory of the Serbian Despotate he lost to the Ottomans. At the same time, Brankoviƒá maintained communication with the garrison in Novo Brdo and his son Grgur, who at the time was an Ottoman governor. That was one of the main reasons why the Ottomans, probably justifiably, accused Grgur of treason and dismissed him from his governorship in April 1441. On 8 May 1441, both Grgur and his brother Stefan were blinded, based on the order of Sultan Murad II. Brankoviƒá faced another disappointment in Zeta where he found out that the Crnojeviƒái rebelled against vojvoda Komnen, the governor of Zeta. Brankoviƒá left Zeta in April 1441 and resided in Ragusa for a while. This angered the Ottomans who requested, through their envoy Agub, that Ragusa should hand over Brankoviƒá. Ragusans refused this request and explained in a letter to Ishak-Beg and Hadƒ±m ≈ûehabeddin that Ragusa has not accepted Brankoviƒá because he was an enemy of the sultan but because it was a free city that accepts anybody who seeks shelter in it. They also emphasized that Brankoviƒá being in Ragusa is the best guarantee that he would not undertake any action against the Ottomans. Ragusans wanted to send their diplomats to Hadƒ±m ≈ûehabeddin and requested his written guarantee for their safe conduct. On 13 June 1441 Hadƒ±m ≈ûehabeddin, who was in Vuƒçitrn at the time, issued the requested guarantee to the Ragusans. During the siege of Novo Brdo its population suffered heavy casualties. On 27 June 1441 Novo Brdo surrendered to the Ottoman forces, who then robbed and burned the captured town.  Aftermath  ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá received the news about the fall of Novo Brdo when he was in Zeta. Stephen Vukƒçiƒá, who was an Ottoman vassal at that time, used the weak position of the Serbian Despot and tried to capture Zeta. After he successfully penetrated into Zeta highlands, the Venetian Republic captured Zeta's coastal cities and regions based on agreement with Despot Brankoviƒá that they will protect his possessions from falling under Ottoman control. Brankoviƒá realized that he lost all of his territory and power base which supplied him with troops necessary to secure his suzerainty, so he moved to his estates in Hungary. Eventually, Zeta fell under control of the local tribes, with the Crnojeviƒái noble family trying to assert their dominance. The Ottomans made significant efforts to again raise Novo Brdo and gave substantial privileges to people who settled in it and worked in its mines while its Serb citizens were awarded with trading privileges. Within the next three years the Ottomans re-established the mint in Novo Brdo which began to strike ak√ße for the first time. In 1444, during the Crusader Long Campaign, Novo Brdo was recaptured from the Ottomans and again became a part of the reestablished Serbian Despotate until it finally fell to Ottoman control on 1 June 1455. Among the survivors of the siege was Dimitrije Kantakouzenos. In 1455, the Ottomans forced the besieged to surrender because they used heavy artillery. All men of any distinguished rank or importance were decapitated under orders of sultan Mehmed II. An estimated 320 boys were taken to become janissaries (dev≈üirme). Approximately 700 girls and young women were given to Ottoman soldiers and their commanders.Dusan T. Batakovic, \\"Kosovo and Metohija Under the Turkish Rule\\" The siege and its aftermath were described in Memoirs of a janissary, written in 1490‚Äî1501 by Novo Brdo resident Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, who was one of the boys taken. In 1455 the last voivode of Serbian despot in Novo Brdo was Lje≈° Spanoviƒá.

He was the eldest of the three brothers, the other two being Pallavur Manian Marar and Pallavur Kunhikuttan Marar, who formed the famed Pallavur trio. Biography Pallavur temple Chenda and Koal (stick) (‡¥ö‡µÜ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Ø‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡µã‡¥≤‡µÅ‡¥Ç) An artist using Ilathalam Appu Marar was born in 1928, at Pallavur, a small hamlet in Palakkad district, in the south Indian state of Kerala, to Shankaran Marar and Ammini. His father, a nomad, left the young Appu and his mother, when he was one year old, throwing the family into poverty. Ammini was forced to remarry Subramania Iyer, and had two more sons, Manian and Kunhikuttan, who, years later, completed the Pallavur trio. Appu started learning traditional percussion instruments at a very young age and had his arangettam (debut) on chenda, at Pallavur Shiva Temple, the age of 8. He, soon, became adept at playing chenda, edeka and timila, under the tutelage of Thiruvilvamala Kondaswami and Parathuveettil Nanu Marar. Appu Marar saw his father for the first time, when he was 17 years old, by which time, he had already mastered those traditional percussion instruments and had started performing at various temples in Kerala. By the time, Appu Marar died in 2002, due to age related illnesses, he had already performed at many stages including in Russia and at 47 Thrissur Poorams and 60 Nemmara Velas. He performed, without break, at Thrissur pooram, heading the panchavadyam for Paremekkavu Devaswom from 1960 till his death in 2002. The legacy of Appu Marar lives on through his numerous disciples, who are active at the temple festivals across the state. His son, Kunissery Chandran, is also a known Maddalam exponent. However, the most notable contribution of Appu Marar remains the style of panchavadyam, he, along with his brothers, have created, the Pallavur style. Kaalam (The Unending Time) K. Ramachandran, a short filmmaker from Kerala, created a documentary, Kaalam (The Unending Time), on the life of Appu Marar. The film, narrates the tumultuous early life of Appu Marar and his later climb to fame, and won the Kerala Kala Mandalam Award for the most outstanding short film on performing arts. The film was also screened at the Festival of South Asian Documentaries at Kathmandu 3‚Äì6 October 2013. The film shows many interviews with Appu Marar's contemporaries and family members. Awards and recognitions Timila Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi honoured Appu Marar, in 1983, by bestowing on him their annual award. Guruvayur Devaswom Board awarded him the Guruvayurappan Puraskaram in 1995. He also received the Manaweeyam Award, in 2002, apart from various other local honours. Honoring the memory of the percussionist, the Government of Kerala has instituted an award, Pallavur Appu Marar Award, which is given annually to recognise excellence in ritual music of Kerala. Another award of the same name, Pallavur Appu Marar Award has also been instituted by the renowned ayurvedic institution, Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala. An annual beat festival, Appu Marar Vadyotsavam, is conducted every year, in Appu Marar's honour. Publications Paramekkavu Bagavathi Temple 0194 Appu Marar has written a book, PrÃ≤amƒÅ·πáa·πÉ: ƒÅtmakatha (Theory and Biography), an autobiography in part, but also containing theories and arguments on traditional Kerala music.

Life  His full name, as it appears in inscriptions, is 'Tribhuvanachakravathi Vijayagandagopaladeva'. He called himself 'Lord of Kanchi'. His rule began in 1250 CE as an independent king. His kingdom witnessed crucial developments during 1250‚Äì1291. Kanchi changed hands in rapid succession among Telugu Chodas, Kakateeyas, Kadava Kopperunjinga and The Pandyas. The change of rule often meant only the de jure change of the overlords. He remained as the local chieftain of Kanchi. His reign was coeval with Rajendra III, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, Kopperunjinga and Kakateeya Ganapathi. He issued his own regnal system between 1253 and 1291, which are found in the Varadaraja Swami Temple. This long rule was interrupted by intrusions. For example, Kopperunjunga is recognized as King of Kanchi from 1253‚Äì1254 AD, again in May 1257 and again in 1260. In the same years, Vijaya GandaGopala is also recognized as ruler of kanchi. This shows the rapid changes in political fortunes of Kanchi and that at one time, rival kings were w54ontlysupported by their adherents. In 1260 AD, Jatavarman II overran Viaya Gandagopala Territory and marched as far as Nellore where he performed 'Virabhisheka'. He anointed himself as king of kanchi.

He was a Knight and Officer of the Legion of Honour. Up until 1815 van Merlen had fought in the French army, including in the Peninsular War as a cavalry commander against the British Army. In the Waterloo Campaign he fought against the French in the Duke of Wellington's army as commander of the 3rd Light Brigade in the Dutch Cavalry Division. Biography At the Battle of L√ºtzen on 2 May 1813, Merlen commanded the 1st Brigade in the 3rd Light Cavalry Division under Louis Pierre Aim√© Chastel. The division belonged to the I Cavalry Corps led by Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg. The brigade counted only 22 officers and 520 men and included elements of the 6th, 8th, 25th and Portuguese Legion Chasseurs √† Cheval and the 6th Hussars. In 1815, King William I of the Netherlands decided that his new army needed experienced officers, even if they had recently fought under Napoleon. Therefore, a number of royalists with scant battle experience lost their positions as regimental commanders. Merlen joined the Royal Duch army as commander of the 3rd Light Brigade in the Dutch Cavalry Division. He fought with his brigade in both the Battle of Quatre Bras (16 June 1815) and two days later at the Battle of Waterloo where he was killed.

It was a separate municipality but became administratively a part of Petrovice u Karvin√© in 1952. The name of the village is topographic in origin denoting dust, soil.  History  It was first mentioned in 1447 in a written sentence: potwrdili jsme Prsnu. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland, since 1327 it was a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Since 1796 the village belonged to Gussnar noble family, who built a residence here in 1798, currently an important landmark in the village. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 448 in 1880 to 680 in 1910. In terms of the language spoken colloquially the majority were Polish-speakers (at least 95.4% in 1880, at most 98.9% in 1900), accompanied by German-speakers (at most 18 or 4.4% in 1880) and Czech-speakers (at most 5 or 0.8% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (679 or 99.9%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

Overview =Name= \\"MUTO\\" is an acronym for \\"Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism\\". Director Gareth Edwards stated that \\"it's basically the UFO of monsters\\". The film's first draft differentiated the male and female MUTO as Hokmuto and Femuto, respectively. Official merchandise connected with the film refer to the male MUTO as \\"Winged MUTO\\" and the female as \\"Eight-Legged MUTO\\". While the term \\"MUTO\\" is used to identify the two parasitic creatures in the film, it was originally used to reference giant monsters who are yet to be named. Such was the case in the official prequel comic, Godzilla: Awakening, where a hive-minded superorganism from the Permian era that feeds on radiation, is identified as a MUTO before being designated as Shinomura (\\"Swarm of Death.\\")Godzilla: Awakening, Max and Greg Borenstein, Chapter 1 In Kong: Skull Island, Bill Randa (played by John Goodman) states that the Monarch agency (first introduced in 2014's Godzilla) specializes in the hunt for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) changes the monsters' designation from \\"MUTOs\\" to \\"Titans\\". =Development= Male MUTO featured in Godzilla: The Art of Destruction Upon acquiring the license for Godzilla, Legendary Pictures had planned to feature two new monsters in addition. David Callaham's first draft featured early versions of the MUTOs where they were established as ancient enemies of Godzilla but never established as to why. When Gareth Edwards came aboard the project, he created a back story to bridge the gap between Godzilla's connection with the MUTOs. Edwards brainstormed the idea that, \\"When these Godzillas were on Earth, there was another creature that would kill them and lay its eggs inside their dead bodies. Therefore, if these creatures ever came back, part of their life cycle would be the ability to attract Godzillas to the surface to kill them for reproduction.\\" In an interview, Edwards commented that it took over a year to design the MUTO creatures, stressing that it took that long to create something that was aimed to be new and different for today's day and age. Edwards and the design team looked towards past monster characters from such films as Jurassic Park, Alien, Starship Troopers and King Kong for inspiration and reflected back on what made these monsters and their designs so iconic. From this, the design for the MUTO monsters kept evolving and \\"mutating\\", according to Edwards, into a design he felt was more cohesive. Edwards has credited artist Matt Allsopp for creating the majority of the MUTO's designs. Edwards stated, \\"The DNA of the MUTO is 80 to 90 percent from Matt, he was the main guy\\". Others contributed to the design of the MUTOs as well such as Weta, Rob Bliss, Steambot, and Legacy, who provided a 3-D model of the MUTOs. The film depicts the MUTOs as a sexually dimorphic species. The female is much larger and walks on eight limbs - the male is much smaller, with one pair of his eight limbs modified into wings for powered flight. Though the MUTOs have an arthropod- like appearance, filmmaker Guillaume Rocheron likened them more to vertebrates. The angularity of the male MUTO's wing design was inspired by stealth aircraft. As a side-effect of the radiation they absorb as food, the MUTOs are capable of causing electromagnetic interference, the male emitting EMP shockwaves from his claws and the female having an EMP field \\"Sphere of Influence\\" surrounding her instead.Godzilla, 2014, Legendary Pictures =Reception= Oliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times called the MUTOs \\"Godzilla's most important co-stars\\", praising them as threatening antagonists that encourage the audience to root for Godzilla. Some viewers have been critical of the MUTOs' design, which was perceived to be similar to that of the monster from Cloverfield. Appearances The term \\"MUTO\\" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) was referenced in Kong: Skull Island (2017). The parent super-species to the MUTO's, dubbed MUTO Prime and Titanus Jinshin-Mushi, appears in the graphic novel Godzilla: Aftershock.

It became administratively a part of Orlov√° in 1946, as opposed to its sister settlement of Doln√≠ Lutynƒõ, which remained independent. It is now the largest district of the town, with a population of over 26000, roughly three quarters of the Orlov√° population.  History  The village of Lutynƒõ was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Luthina LXXI) mansi. It meant that the village was supposed to pay tithe from 71 greater lans. The village could have been founded by Benedictine monks from Orlov√° abbeyI.

Politically the villages belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.

Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II and renamed to Ober-Leuten (Horn√≠ Lutynƒõ). After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia and in 1960 it was joined with Orlov√° to form a new district called Lutynƒõ. Subsequently, it was the place where the Communists built new housing estates to lodge an increasing number of inhabitants. The district grew to become the largest in Orlov√°.

It is based on the comedy play with the same name by Aldo De Benedetti, which had previously inspired the film I Don't Know You Anymore directed by Nunzio Malasomma and starred by Vittorio De Sica. Plot  Luisa is married to the lawyer Paolo Malpieri and their marriage seems to proceed normally, until she, coming home and finding her husband in the shower, treats him like a complete stranger and accuses him of being a sex maniac, calling in the police. The psychiatrist Alberto Spinelli, who should have taken care of Paolo, easily realizes that the problem belongs to Luisa and tries to subject her to therapy; the problem worsens as soon Luisa is convinced that Alberto is her husband. From that moment, the life of the spouses is upset: Alberto, convinced that Luisa has suffered a trauma, supports her to try to heal her; while Paolo, jealous, wants to resume his post as consort and fears that the psychiatrist will take advantage of the situation. After various misadventures (which also involve Luisa's eccentric aunt, who got mad at Paolo), Alberto realizes that the cause of Luisa's problem is Allegra, Paolo's young and busty typist. Luisa offers of her own free will to reconstruct a precise event and lets it be understood that she has glimpsed him and Allegra in an unequivocal attitude through a half-open door. After finishing telling the fact, Luisa appears able to remember everything, recognizing Paolo as her husband: later she confesses that she has never lost her memory, and that she has devised a stratagem to punish her husband for his betrayal. The two reconcile, while Alberto, who after his long association had begun to fall in love with the woman, remains alone and disconsolate.

Many of his photographs were used to produce picture postcards of the seaside towns and attractions in the South of England. Many of these postcards are still circulating at postcard fairs and acquired by collectors. They are usually identifiable by the initials \\"MJR\\" followed by a serial number. Several thousand of his original glass-plate negatives still exist and are being academically catalogued. A large sub-section of these negatives, featuring scenes in Wales, is held by the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. Although based in Bournemouth, Ridley's photographs span from Oxford in the north and Cornwall in the south-west to the Isle of Wight in the south. Early life Martin John Ridley was born in January 1861, in Reading, the son of William Ridley, a timber merchant from White Notley in Essex, and Mira from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. He had four brothers: Ernest, Bernard, Thomas and Edward. The 1871 census shows the 10-year-old Martin Ridley at boarding school in Staplegrove, near Taunton in Somerset. The 1881 census records the family living in East Gate House, Sonning, near Reading. Martin, then aged 20, was a Merchant's Clerk. Evidently, the family was quite well off as they employed a governess and two domestic servants. In 1888, Martin married Alice from Wrentham, Suffolk, and by 1891, they were living at 3 Victoria Buildings, Old Christchurch Road, Holdenhurst, Bournemouth with their children Walford and Winifred (born 1890 in Margate, Kent) and their housemaid. By this stage, Ridley's occupation is listed as Photographer. By 1903, the Ridleys were living at 37 Haviland Road, Boscombe, Bournemouth and had a new son, Cecil Leighton, who was born in Boscombe in 1897, Walford having died in 1894, aged just five years. Starting the photographic business At some point between 1891 and 1894 Ridley teamed up with Harry Alfred Miell from 45 Catherine Street, Salisbury. It may well have been Miell's influence that started the whole photographic partnership as Harry Miell's father, James, was a photographic dealer when Harry was still a young boy, and by the time of the 1881 census, Harry too is registered as a photographer. By 1901 Miell had moved to Bournemouth with his wife, two children and brother-in-law, and was listed as an employer in a photographic business. The 1911 census lists him as a photographic publisher. Winifred, Ridley's daughter, then 21, is also mentioned and has \\"Photo Printing & Colorist\\" as her occupation. Harry Miell and Martin Ridley formed Miell & Ridley, Bournemouth & Bristol with premises firstly at the Ridley home and then at 90 Old Christchurch Road, Bournemouth. It seems that Miell did mostly portraiture in the studio while Ridley concentrated on landscapes, townscapes and seaside shots ‚Äì often for the purpose of producing Cartes de Visite. Picture postcards made from Ridley's photographs are still highly collectible items and are frequently found on eBay and at postcard fairs. The cards are mostly coloured and would have been hand-tinted as part of the production process, which mostly happened in Germany, presumably ending with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Post-World War 1 Not much is known of Ridley after this period except that his health was failing and much of the work of the photographic business fell to his daughter Winifred who also struggled to keep it going, having to cope with nursing sick relatives as well as homing wartime refugees. It appears that the Ridley & Miell partnership may also not have survived past the First World War. Portrait photographs from 1928 exist and bear the name ‚ÄúMiell & Miell‚Äù, so it may be that Harry Miell set up in business with his son. Ridley himself died in Bournemouth in June 1936, aged 75. Son Cecil married in 1921 and lived to the age of 89, dying in Manchester in 1985 without children. The photographic collection After 70 years of being the Ridley family home, 37 Haviland Road, Bournemouth, was to be redeveloped. So in May 1964, Martin Ridley's daughter, Miss Winifred Ridley, began the enormous task of disposing of her Father's photographic materials. The Bournemouth Library took many of the printed cards and some of the local glass-plate negatives. The remainder of the glass plates ‚Äì probably more than 6000 ‚Äì were to be destroyed by burial in a hole in the garden. Hearing of the impending destruction of these plates, Mrs Pamela Mole, a Bournemouth businesswoman, bought the collection from Miss Winifred and rescued the condemned glass plates from the tarpaulin where they were about to be tipped into the hole. She put them into storage until such times as she could consider what to do with them. Retirement in 2007 finally gave her the chance to claim the plates back from storage and decide what to do with them. Over the years, some of the plates had gone missing and some decayed, but the current collection of about 5000‚Äì6000 is safe and the vast majority render superb images. Now living in Cambridge, Mrs Mole teamed up with local architect and photographer Bruce Stuart, and university lecturer John Martin to begin the task of capturing the glass images onto modern digital storage media, while also attempting to identify and catalogue the images. As of 2015 a significant number of the glass negatives are owned by the NetXPosure Image Library and many can be viewed online. The glass negatives have been scanned at a very high resolution and are going through the digital restoration process. Significance of the collection Photography was born some 35 years before Martin Ridley, so he cannot be described as a pioneer of the artform. However, Ridley was active as a photographer when the medium was still very much in its Golden Age. His photographs are a fine record of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, showing the dress, transport, industry, architecture, social life and obsessions of the time. Those interested in trams, early motorcars, Welsh collieries, steamships and bridges will not be disappointed. A few photographs clearly show post-Great War developments and it can be assumed that Ridley continued to photograph into the 1920s or maybe even slightly later. The collection is smaller than the better-known Frith Collection, but Frith covered much of England whereas Ridley never seemed to go further north than Oxford. A few true gems of history are also to be found in the collection. For example, a photograph of Stonehenge taken in c1901 shows that the world-famous stone circle was very different 100 years ago. Many of the buildings that Ridley photographed were subsequently destroyed in World War II. The small sub-section of Bristol scenes demonstrates this nicely. The Roman Baths in Bath were being renovated in Ridley's time, and he has captured images during that period that will not be seen again. Very curiously, there are a few photographs taken in Australia. It is not known if Ridley visited Australia himself or if these few photographs are copies he made from the work of others. The Welsh photographs Over 800 of the photographs are of locations in Wales. They range from landscapes and townscapes to castles, docks and collieries. The Welsh section of the collection is the first to be catalogued and stored on digital media. The vast majority of the Welsh photographs are annotated. Ridley meticulously recorded the subject and location in ink on the glass plates themselves ‚Äì something which, unfortunately, he did not do with many of the English photographs, presumably through familiarity. In circa 1905, Ridley was responsible for the publication of a booklet entitled 'Sixty-One Views of The Rhondda Valley' It is not yet clear if these photographs are part of, or in addition to, the collection currently discussed here. Cardiff, Abertillery, Penarth, Newport and Cowbridge also feature heavily in the Welsh section. In February 2009, the Welsh section of plates was sold to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.

Biography Briegel studied physics and philosophy at the Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich (1983-1990, terms 1986‚Äì1987 at the University of Edinburgh). In 1990 he graduated with a diploma, and in 1994 he completed the PhD program (thesis title: The Jaynes-Cummings Model with Dissipation and its Application for the Dynamics of Microscopic Masers and Lasers). He worked as Research Associate at the Texas A&M; University and as Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University and the University of Innsbruck. During that time he was also visiting scientist at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. In 1997 he became Research Associate at the University of Munich and after his habilitation in 2002 (Quantum Information and Computer) he became Associate Professor (German: Privatdozent). In 2003 he was offered a Chair in Theoretical Physics at the University of D√ºsseldorf, which he declined. In the same year he accepted the post as Full Professor at the University of Innsbruck and as a Scientific Director at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Among other institutions, he has lectured and researched as visiting professor at the University of Bristol, UK, and the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Hans Briegel is married and has two children. Research Hans Briegel has developed fundamental concepts in the field of quantum information, quantum computing and quantum communication. In 2001, together with Robert Raussendorf, he introduced the concept of a one-way quantum computer or measurement-based quantum computer model, which presented a new paradigm for building a quantum computer. According to Thomson Reuter's analysis, the publication of this work is the second most-often cited publication in the field of quantum computing research in the first decade of the 21st century. Together with his work in cluster and graph states, it led to a completely new understanding of entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing. The concept of the quantum repeater, presented by Hans Briegel and his colleagues in 1998, plays an important role in quantum communication. In recent years Hans Briegel has explored topics bordering on other scientific fields: He has investigated whether entanglement states also exist in biological systems, for example in the magnetic compass of migratory birds. Briegel has also published work relating to the topic of agency and free will; he opposes the notion that the laws of nature don't permit free will. He developed a theoretical model that he calls ‚Äúprojective simulation‚Äù, which allows for a rudimentary form of creative behavior for artificial agents.

After a brief spell on loan at York City, Burluraux signed for Fourth Division club Darlington. He was the club's player of the year in his first season, and played more than 100 times over three seasons, but the damage to his ankle forced his retirement from professional football at the age of 24. He played for Northern League club Whitby Town until at least 1980, and was player-manager in the 1978‚Äì79 season. After finishing with football, Burluraux worked for ICI as a quality control laboratory analyst, managed Redcar tourist information office, and acted as co-ordinator of a \\"walking for health\\" scheme for his local healthcare trust. Between 1999 and 2007 Burluraux ran the \\"North York Moors CAM\\" website which contains dozens of illustrated walks in and around the North York Moors.

He associated with the Hartlib Circle, and was considered by Richard Popkin to belong to his \\"Third Force\\". Life The eldest son of Georg Ritschel, a Bohemian, by Gertrude, his wife, he was born at Deutsch Kahn in Bohemia on 13 February 1616. He was educated at the university of Strasburg (1633‚Äì40), and then, on the expulsion of Protestants from Bohemia, gave his inheritance to his younger brother rather than convert to Catholicism. Travelling to England, he arrived in Oxford, and was admitted into the Bodleian Library on 3 December 1641. On the outbreak out of the First English Civil War, Ritschel left England and visited The Hague, Leyden, and Amsterdam. He obtained the post of tutor to the sons of the Prince of Transylvania; and in 1643 he travelled in Denmark, and spent over a year at Copenhagen and Sor√∏. In 1644 he visited Poland. There he was taken on as assistant to Comenius. From Danzig Ritschel returned to England, where he was welcomed by Samuel Hartlib. He worked for several years on a project, supporting the writing of the Janua Rerum of Comenius. After a stay in London, he settled in Oxford, at Kettel Hall, as a member of Trinity College. From December 1646, he was able to study again in the Bodleian Library. In 1647 he broke off with Comenius, however, differing from him on philosophical matters, and the role given to Cyprian Kinner, a rival. He was appointed headmaster of Newcastle grammar school, on 29 August 1648. In 1655 or 1656 Ritschel was appointed rector of Hexham, Northumberland, and as \\"pastor\\" there signed the address to the Protector Oliver Cromwell from the ministers of the Newcastle area, in August 1657. That year he may have been tutoring as Cromwell's Durham College was launched. Ritschel died in possession of the vicarage of Hexham on 28 December 1683, and was buried in the chancel of his church, where an inscription was erected to his memory on a blue marble stone in the choir.

History  Commonly known as the Austin Lighthouse, the [Travis County] Association for the Blind was founded in 1934 eventually shortening its name to Travis Association for the Blind. At its start, the organization employed blind people producing woven mats and canning peaches. During World War II the United States government took advantage of the newly legislated Wagner-O'Day Act of 1938 and began purchasing mops produced at the Austin Lighthouse. In 1971, under the leadership of United States Senator Jacob Javits of New York the act was amended to include all individuals with severe disabilities, becoming the Javits‚ÄìWagner‚ÄìO'Day Act (JWOD). Over the years, the Austin Lighthouse has manufactured a number of different sewing products, bottled and packaged 200+ different skin care products and warehoused / distributed items for the military and state government customers. Major League Baseball player \\"Prince\\" Oana worked for Travis Association for the Blind during seven years in the late 1950s and early 1960s because of cataracts in both eyes. Today, the Austin Lighthouse is composed of three main divisions; distribution, manufacturing and training / education. The distribution division has approximately 800,000 sqft of warehouse space, receiving, sorting, identifying, laundering, repairing, labeling, packaging and distributing items for the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard. In the manufacturing division a variety of skincare products are produced, as well as textiles, notebook binders, award plaques and others.

It is constructed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with major subsystems being delivered from Malin Space Science Systems and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Principal Investigator is Luther Beegle, and the Deputy Principal Investigator is Rohit Bhartia. SHERLOC will have a calibration target with possible Mars suit materials, and it will measure how they change over time in the Martian surface environment. Goals According to a 2017 Universities Space Research Association (USRA) report: Construction SHERLOC will be mounted on the robotic arm of the Perseverance rover. It consists of both imaging and spectroscopic elements. It has two imaging components consisting of heritage hardware from the MSL MAHLI instrument. One is a built to print re-flight that can generate color images over multiple scales. The other acts as the mechanism that allows the instrument to get a contextual image of a sample and to autofocus the laser spot for the spectroscopic part of the SHERLOC investigation. For Spectroscopy, it utilizes a NeCu laser to generate UV photons (248.6 nm) which can generate characteristic Raman and fluorescence photons from a scientifically interesting sample. The deep UV laser is co-boresighted to a context imager and integrated into an autofocusing/scanning optical system that allows correlation of spectral signatures to surface textures, morphology and visible features. The context imager has a spatial resolution of 30 ¬µm and currently is designed to operate in the 400-500 nm wavelength range.

The other two being the Police Benevolent Association and Sergeants Benevolent Association. History The Detectives' Endowment Association was founded in 1917 to represent active and retired detectives of the New York City Police Department. In 1963 it was granted independent collective bargaining rights to negotiate on behalf its members. In 2013 the Union won a case in Manhattan Supreme Court over pay discrepancies involving the salary raises for detectives and police officers. Their case was rejected by the Board of Collective Bargaining, but a judge ruled in their favor and the detectives were promised back pay. In June 2020 three Bronx officers who visited a Manhattan Shake Shack accused the store's employees of poisoning them, saying that a toxic substance had been added to their drinks. The Detectives' Endowment Association went so far as to issue a safety alert on Twitter, claiming that the officers had been \\"intentionally poisoned.\\" A full investigation by the NYPD vindicated the employees and determined that an improperly cleaned machine left a residue of bleach or a cleaning agent in the officers' beverages. Organization and Membership The Union represents 5,500 active and 12,000 retired New York City Police Detectives. Members of the Union and some of their family members are given union membership cards which have been the subject of some controversy. Although the cards are not recognized by the police department, in some cases non-members have purchased them online and used them as a way to avoid traffic tickets. This controversy caused some effort within the New York City Council to ban the membership cards, but as of 2014 they have not been. Political advocacy The Detectives' Endowment Association actively participates in politics by endorsing and donating to the campaigns of different politicians. They also employ a registered lobbying firm, Pitta Bishop Del Giorno & Giblin LLC, to lobby on their behalf with the city government. In 2012 they donated over $350,000 to both Republican and Democratic campaigns, with 50% going to Republicans and 48% to Democrats. In 2014 they endorsed New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman after endorsing his opponent four years earlier, citing Schneiderman's support for increased bulletproof vest distribution, expanded background checks, and combating smart phone crime.

She had a single deck gun. A day later she called at Milford Haven, and on 8 August joined the outward-bound Liverpool Convoy OB 195. Sinking On 21 August 1940, some 800 miles west of the Canary Islands at 20:20 hours, the Widder approached the Anglo Saxon in pitch darkness and opened fire from a range of approximately one mile. The first salvo of shells landed on Anglo Saxon's poop and gun platform aft and ignited ammunition for the deck gun. This salvo killed most of the crew located in forecastle. As the Widder approached closer, she opened fire with flak, killing more of the crew, and holing the lifeboats the crew were attempting to launch on the starboard side of the ship. More 37mm and 20mm flak destroyed the wireless room, and no signal was sent from the merchantman. Another salvo of shells penetrated the boiler room and exploded the boiler. The Anglo Saxons captain, Paddy Flynn, had been killed while throwing the ship's confidential paperwork overboard, and the order went out to abandon ship. The coup de gr√¢ce from Widder came from a torpedo and the Anglo Saxon quickly sank stern first. Survivors record the Widder strafing lifeboats with machine gun fire before steaming eastward having not searched for any survivors. Surviving crew in the jolly boat Seven crew members managed to get into the port side jolly boat, unseen by the Widder. These men were: Barry C. Denny (mate, 31), Lionel H. Hawks (engineer, 23), Leslie J. Morgan (cook, 20, injured foot), Francis G. Penny (Royal Marine gunner, 44, shot through right arm and right leg), Roy H. Pilcher (radio operator, 21, injured from gun fire), Robert G. Tapscott (able seaman, 19) and Wilbert 'Roy' Widdicombe (able seaman, 24). The survivors saw two other lifeboats leaving the stricken Anglo Saxon; both had lights which attracted the gunners on the Widder which open fire and killed all aboard the craft. The jolly boat crew remained in the vicinity all night and at dawn set sail and headed west. The jolly boat, smaller than a cutter, was a clinker-built ship's boat used as a hack boat for small work and as a lifeboat. It was long and across its beam. The boat contained the following items: *a canvas sail *compass *sea anchor *axe *boat cover *flares *matches *medical kit *six pairs of oars *one 20 lb tin of ships' biscuits *11 tins of condensed milk *16 lb of tinned mutton *four gallons of water. The voyage The crew initially laid low to avoid the Widder and then set sail west the following morning aiming for an island in the Caribbean or to attract a ship with the flares. From the on-board rations, each man was allocated half a cup of water with half a biscuit, with an occasional issue of tinned mutton and condensed milk. The first of the seven survivors to die was Roy Pilcher, who succumbed to a gangrenous foot on 1 September 1940. With each passing day the health of the survivors deteriorated, as did their morale. Denny noted in his log: \\"Do not feel particularly hungry but suffer from parched throat owing to low water ration\\". The lack of water made eating the hard ships' biscuits almost impossible. Denny's last log entry on 2 September, suggested a list of future rations to be stored in lifeboats. The log, written by another survivor, noted on 4 September that Francis Penny had \\"slipped overboard\\" (this is usually inferred to mean the person, of their own volition, decided to commit suicide by drowning rather than try any further to survive). A day later on 5 September Denny and Lionel Hawks \\"go over the side no water\\" (as with Penny, these men probably committed suicide by drowning, having given up hope of rescue). By 9 September, Leslie Morgan, \\"goes mad dies\\". This now left just two survivors - Wilbert Roy Widdicombe and Robert George Tapscott. A rain shower on 12 September replenished their water reserves for six days with more rain collected on 20 September lasting a further four days. All water and ships' biscuits had been used by 24 September. With five weeks already spent in the boat, another five weeks of drifting westward lay ahead for both men. Survival for both men was now a matter of good fortune. They ate drifting seaweed and a flying fish landed in the boat. Rain squalls provided more water but the men were so thirsty that they were driven to drinking the fluid from the compass they had. Although two ships passed them, they were unable to attract their attention. Widdicombe, now desperate, lost his front teeth chewing the leather of his shoes. Tapscott simply lay motionless in the bottom of the boat. By the 68th day adrift in the jolly boat, Widdicombe was slipping into unconsciousness, but with the sight of an island on the 69th day, the men managed to steer the lifeboat to landfall. Landing After 70 days and almost since the sinking of the Anglo Saxon, on Wednesday 30 October 1940 the two survivors landed on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Widdicombe and Tapscott were transferred to a hospital in Nassau, Bahamas, where they slowly recovered. Widdicombe commented on his survival: > I wondered if I was dreaming when I saw a strange face leaning over me. And > then the whole horrid situation came back to me with all its vividness, and > I suffered a severe misgiving, until the man started to talk to me and then > I realised that we had had the good fortune to wash up on one of Britain‚Äôs > far flung colonies. > My relief at the realisation that I was alive and safe on land among > friends was indescribable. Both men were visited by the Duke of Windsor, then Governor, and the Duchess of Windsor. Roy Widdicombe recovered first and travelled from the Bahamas to New York. In February 1941, he joined the Siamese Prince on her return to Liverpool. On the 17th February 1941, the merchantman was torpedoed by the with the loss of all 68 aboard, one day short of her destination. Tapscott gradually recovered and moved to Canada in 1941 and initially enlisted in the Canadian Army. The army though recorded that Tapscott was suffering from 'neurosis anxiety' (more commonly known as PTSD today). He rejoined the Merchant Navy in March 1943 and remained in that service throughout the war. He committed suicide at his home in Cardiff, aged 42, in September 1963. He had written a suicide note to the local paper, the South Wales Echo, in which he described how the depression he was suffering, from his experience lost at sea, were making his life intolerable. Tapscott had a wife, Norma, and daughter Diane. The captain of the Widder (and later the ), Helmuth von Ruckteschell, was captured by the British and tried for war crimes. In May 1947, he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, commuted to 7 years and died in prison, aged 58. The jolly boat The jolly boat at the Imperial War Museum, London Lady Oakes, the wife of a wealthy Canadian, Sir Harry Oakes, bought the jolly boat at auction in Nassau in December 1940. She donated the boat to the Mystic Seaport Museum, Connecticut, in 1941, where it was displayed. By the fiftieth anniversary in 1990, the boat had been put in storage at the museum. The Imperial War Museum, London, contacted the museum and the boat was transferred to London where it is on display. One of the key people involved in the repatriation of the jolly boat was Anthony Smith, the broadcaster and author of 'Survived', an account of the Anglo Saxon and her crew. Together with Ted Milburn, the son of the Anglo Saxons Chief Engineer, they worked to get the boat moved to the Imperial War Museum London. The jolly boat finally returned to the UK on 15 November 1997. After conservation the boat was put on display in May 1998 as the central exhibit of 'Survival at Sea: Stories of the Merchant Navy in the Second World War'.

Life  Wiercinski completed his M.A. with distinction in Theology (Catholic University of Lublin, 1984), and was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Lublin April 4, 1985. In 1990 he took his doctorate in philosophy with Stanis≈Çaw Wielgus at the Catholic University of Lublin with a dissertation, Die scholastischen Vorbedingungen der Metaphysik Gustav Siewerths: Eine historisch-kritische Studie mit Bezug auf die Seinsvergessenheitstheorie von Martin Heidegger. His second doctorate was in Theology with Gerhard-Ludwig M√ºller at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich with a dissertation, Der Dichter in seinem Dichtersein: Versuch einer philosophisch- theologischen Deutung des Dichterseins am Beispiel von Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz. In 2007, Wiercinski took his Habilitation in Philosophy of Religion at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t in Freiburg i.Br. with a monograph, Hermeneutics Between Philosophy and Theology: The Imperative to Think the Incommensurable. After obtaining a venia legendi in Philosophy of Religion, Wiercinski was 2007-2012 Privatdozent before becoming in 2012 ausserplanm√§√üiger Professor (Professor extra numerum) of Philosophy of Religion at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg, Germany.  Work  Wiercinski has generated research accomplishments in his subject areas that demonstrate his scholarly expertise both in the range of his works as well as in their broad, contentful composition. He understands hermeneutics as a specific mind-set of openness that admits of neither a priori nor apodictic demarcations between domains of knowledge, but instead sits decidedly between them in order to overcome the compartmentalization of knowledge forms from each other. Despite the postmodern format of this hermeneutic in-between ‚Äî which of course will not be raised to a trans- regional, conceptually achievable absolutism ‚Äî Wiercinski positions hermeneutics within the horizon of man‚Äôs unmistakable ability to attain truth, which actualizes itself in the history of knowledge and its forms. He understands philosophy of religion as the hermeneutic mediation between the incommensurable knowledge forms of religion/theology and philosophy, which are not separated off from one another but rather allude to one another both genealogically and constitutively. In order to bring theology and philosophy into conversation with each other, Wiercinski has edited an entire row of anthologies, organized conferences, and taken part in many himself with talks. The hermeneutical in-between, which he takes up under numerous titles in lectures and publications, emblematically indicates not only a theoretical form, but also his marked talent for organizing and facilitating scholarly endeavor. In teaching and research, Wiercinski is especially concerned with philosophical and theological hermeneutics, with the approaches of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur and the hermeneutic reappropriation of the metaphysics of the Middle-Ages, in conversation with Martin Heidegger and Gustav Siewerth; with German Idealism ‚Äî especially Schelling ‚Äî as well as with the hermeneutics of education, communication, medicine, and psychoanalysis. A main focus of his writing has been the hermeneutic retrieval of medieval metaphysics. His hermeneutics of education and hermenutics of medicine contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between human social sciences and natural sciences and their impact on contemporary society. As a prolific author, an accomplished manager and knowledge facilitator, he serves on the advisory boards of many international societies and on the editorial boards of international academic journals. =Wiercinski's hermeneutic philosophy of religion= Wiercinski situates the contemporary debate regarding the relationship between philosophy and theology beyond Athens and Jerusalem. The original antinomy of Tertullian collapsed in light of the undeniably theological development of modern Western philosophy. The intellectual legacies of the Middle-Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment demonstrate that philosophy and theology are inseparably entrenched. Wiercinski observantly reveals that the representative theologians of the twentieth century were strongly philosophically informed. The theological profundity of Bultmann, Barth, Rahner, and von Balthasar, each in his own way, was a profundity of classical German philosophy. On the other hand, philosophy has theology to thank for its unmistakable radiance. Modern philosophers like Kant, Hegel, and Schelling are unthinkable without a theological background, not to mention postmoderns like Heidegger or Levinas. The necessity to pose philosophical questions and contemplate natural theology became a dominating concern not only for Christianity, but also for Western philosophy. For Wiercinski, hermeneutics thoughtfully pursues a degree of mediation between the two poles of opposed misunderstandings of religion and the secular world. Hermeneutics comes to the aid of a strained relationship like a middleman and becomes ever more conscious of the finitude and historicity of understanding. The divide between theology and philosophy in the Western tradition is simply not a problem that must be overcome. In fact, this divide gave rise to a fruitful legacy that provoked both philosophy and theology to pose hermeneutical questions. On the basis of hermeneutics, Wiercinski invites a rejection of Heidegger‚Äôs call for a radical separation between philosophy and theology. Such a separation is hermeneutically untenable. Independently of how strictly the disciplines attempt to maintain their distance from one another, the opposing influence cannot be avoided. It is already a historical fact. Hermeneutics calls for new and renewed consideration of the problematic connections of theology and philosophy, and even at different levels. Philosophy and theology are not simply static disciplines that must somehow become methodologically associated, but historical disciplines with their own distinctive intellectual histories. They are fertilized by very the individuals that they nourish. The hermeneutico-critical apparatus, narrative identity in particular, is necessary in order to reclaim, in a constructive articulation, the tradition of respect and connection between philosophy and theology. The space that is to be established anew between philosophy and theology thanks to the contemplation of the incommensurable is an invitation to hermeneutics. That which happens in the no-man‚Äôs land between the two disciplines is hermeneutics and can only be hermeneutics. It is a hermeneutics between the courage to inquire and the humility to listen. Wiercinski claims no final judgment regarding the single proper connection of philosophy and theology, but attempts rather to show another way, a way that is to negotiate between the two disciplines. The sole possibility of disclosing this way lies in actually practicing hermeneutics. The incommensurability of philosophy and theology yearns for a myriad of interpretations. Philosophy and theology cannot eliminate such an open space for the manifold of interpretations, not even with reference to the distance between the two. Neither can one forbid the other from understanding and interpreting their connection differently. The belonging-together of philosophy and theology discloses that Western philosophy and the theological tradition have developed, historically, with and alongside one and another. Throughout intellectual history there were movements that would be interpreted as philosophically autonomous, but were nonetheless entangled with theological background. On the other hand, we can also ask the theological side what would have become of Christianity without the encounter with Greek metaphysics. Surely something completely other, perhaps unthinkably other. Luther would not have been able to rediscover original Christianity without metaphysics because, to put it hermeneutically, this would have passed over the historical facticity of the matter. Hermeneutic philosophy must incorporate theology because can do nothing else. The reverse also applies. The object of hermeneutics, the matter itself, is theological in such a way that it incorporates voices that the tradition that we are generates. Hermeneutics is not theology, but must remain open for it. A hermeneutics which finds itself ‚Äúbetween‚Äù the divine and the human can reveal a modus existendi for the people of the age of interpretation. This ‚Äúhermeneutics of between‚Äù of philosophy and theology wants to let the plenitude of diverse voices come to speech in order to be able to address the drama of human existence with the acuteness that it deserves. In the hermeneutic age, philosophy has lost its claim to speak from an absolute perspective. Many of the arguments against the integration of theology into philosophy draw the false conclusion that if philosophy as ‚Äúpure reason‚Äù is free from cultural entanglement, then it is also not subject to theology, since this latter is always culturally conditioned with respect to its particular and historical belief community. Hermeneutics helps to recognize that Western philosophy is just as much a cultural phenomenon as Western theology. It is a kind of confession of faith in critical thinking, founded by Socrates, refined in the Middle-Ages, and fully developed in the rational triumph of the Enlightenment. That this creed strives toward antinomy does not change the fact that it is anchored in culturally and theologically conditioned situations. Actually, philosophy in the West is just as much a form of life or art of living as theology. This is an idea that existentialism rediscovered from the Greeks. If philosophy and theology are both forms of living (as Wittgenstein opined) neither of the two has any a priori primacy over the other. Theology thus loses this privilege along with philosophy, and yet one can speak with reference to the relation between them from a philosophical and a theological perspective. Two forms of living are speaking with one another. However, theology has something of which no philosophy can assure itself, namely, the authority of God. Philosophy has yet something that theology cannot have: skeptical freedom from authority. In our conversations we must thus clearly distinguish between the theological and philosophical perspective and recognize that the other view, theological or philosophical, remains ever possible. Such an understanding gives theology and philosophy freedom to continue to develop themselves in dialogical independence from one another and to liberate themselves from the idealism of a synthesis of the two disciplines. Only in becoming conscious of their differences can one retain a firm foundation for conversation between them. Like every other hermeneutical conversation, it comes to be a recognition of opposing indebtedness that has a transformative character. As the art of understanding, hermeneutics stipulates that an undertaking like this integrates the theoretical dimension of the question with the factical. Theology is no mere academic discipline. It is a mode of our being-in-the-world. With certain reservations, the same can be said of philosophy. Not only are two disciplines colliding, two alternative ways of being human are observing each other with a suspicious eye so that the other constitutes a provocation and a threat of its peculiar belief and conception of reality. An important contribution of hermeneutics consists in that it precludes any rash problem-solving, independent of whether it concerns itself with a liberal synthesis of two different discourses or a post-liberal burial of antagonism between them. This perpetual dialogue admits of no ultimate conclusion. Indeed, it would bad hermeneutician who would think that he has the last word, must have the last word, or even could have the last word.

Founded in 1999, the newspaper is owned by the Cebu City-based SunStar group of community newspapers. Initially a print publication, the SunStar Manila was partially funded by the acquisition of businessman William Gatchalian, also known as the \\"plastics king\\" for his dominance of the Philippine plastic industry, of a minority stake in the newspaper: his second attempt at investing in a newspaper after owning a minority share in the SunStar Cebu in the 1980s, which he sold off in 1986. He was invited to invest in the Manila edition as the family of former Transportation Secretary Jesus B. Garcia, which owns the SunStar Cebu and its sister publications, was unable to bankroll a Manila‚Äîand therefore truly national‚Äîedition on its own. The acquisition was controversial at the time given Gatchalian's closeness to then-President Joseph Estrada as a member of his so-called \\"midnight cabinet\\", leading to fears that the newspaper would be used to sway public opinion. This charge was denied by Hector Villanueva, then editor-in-chief of the SunStar Cebu. This was evidenced by the newspaper being one of only a handful of publications printing articles written by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) highlighting the extent of the Estrada family's business holdings, a decision criticized by critics of the PCIJ. Despite the paper's initial success, with its 2002 daily circulation of 87,000 copies being larger than even more established newspapers such as The Manila Times, the SunStar Manila was not profitable, and publication of the print edition was ultimately ceased in favor of maintaining an online-only edition some time thereafter.

Origin The hymn was written in the 8th century CE by Adi Sankara, a revered Hindu philosopher and theologian. Sankara took Sanyasa (renunciation) at the age of eight. One day, as a young boy, he was on bhiksha for alms to prepare his lunch and happened upon the doorstep of a very poor Brahmin lady. Having nothing edible in her home, the lady frantically searched her house, only to find a single amla (Amalak, gooseberry) fruit which she then hesitantly offered to Sankara. Sankara was so moved by the incredible kindness and selflessness of this woman that he burst forth into poetry and sang 21 stanzas in praise of Goddess Lakshmi. Pleased by the beauty and power of the hymn, the Goddess appeared before him and asked him why he had remembered her. Sankara pleaded with the Goddess to reverse the fortunes of this lady's family by granting her riches. At first, Goddess Lakshmi refused to do so, saying that the lady had not been charitable in her previous birth and was bound by the laws of karma to have a fate bound to poverty in her current birth. Sankara implored the Goddess that the lady's act of absolute selflessness should absolve her of her sins of the past and that Lakshmi was the only one capable of changing the fate of someone by erasing or changing the writings of the future made by Lord Brahma. Goddess Lakshmi was so pleased that she instantly showered the lady's house with goose berries made of pure gold. The stanza that contains the purport of Sankara's imploration to Goddess Lakshmi is among the most important ones in this hymn: > ‡§¶‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§™‡§µ‡§®‡•ã ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡§£‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡•Å‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§ï‡§ø‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§®‡§µ‡§ø‡§π‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§∂‡§ø‡§∂‡•å ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§£‡•ç‡§£‡•á ‡•§ > ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ò‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§™‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ö‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§£‡§Ø‡§ø‡§®‡•Ä‡§®‡§Ø‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡•Å‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§É ‡•• May She (Goddess > Lakshmi) bestow (upon us) a stream of wealth through the wind of her mercy, > For I, utterly destitute and downcast by poverty, am as helpless as the > newborn child of a bird, May She (Goddess Lakshmi) remove forever the heat I > suffer due to the sins of my past, O, beloved of Narayana, may your eyes > rain upon me (the shower of your mercy.) The 21 stanzas of then became famous and are read by all devout Hindus for wellbeing. Description The hymn contains a description of the beauty, personality, power and graciousness of Goddess Lakshmi. Sankara does not distinguish between the three Goddesses of Hinduism.

Located 10 km south of Jelling near the village of Ravning, it crossed the meadows of Ravning Enge at Vejle River. Until the Little Belt Bridge was constructed in 1935, it was the longest bridge in Denmark.  Discovery and dating  In 1953 big shaped oak timber was found near Ravning at the south side of the Vejle River Valley. An amateur archaeologist, K.V. Christensen, heard about the findings, and measured the timber. Later more timber was found where ponds for fish farming were constructed, this time at the north side of the valley. K.V. Christensen concluded that the timber probably was from a bridge and wrote an article about that in 1959. Later the mire in the river valley sank as the result of drainage and regulation of Vejle River, and the top of some of the bridge posts came over the ground surface. Now the National Museum of Denmark became involved. A piece of oak was dated by radiocarbon dating to year 980 with an uncertainty of 100 years, and it was decided to make an excavation which started in 1972. The National Museum made dendrochronological analyses of samples of the timber from the bridge. The conclusion was that the timber was felled in the 980s, probably in the first half of the decade. The end date of the interval has been questioned by another dendrochronologist who concludes that the date cannot be stated more precisely than \\"after c. 980 and before c. 1010\\" Oak pillar from the Viking bridge across Ravning Enge 979-980 A.D. - VIKING exhibition at the National Museum of Denmark - Photo The National Museum of Denmark (9081544395).jpgOak post from the bridge at National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen  Construction and purpose  The run of the former Viking Age Ravning Bridge, across the meadows of Ravning Enge. Remains of the Ravning Bridge. The planks only cover a third of its former width. The Ravning Bridge is thought to have been built in the Viking Age around 980 AD, as ordered by King Harald Bluetooth, who also built the Viking ring castles. Like these fortresses, the Ravning Bridge was in use for a short time. The bridge, 5 metres wide and almost 760 metres long. was built with oak timber. The spans were 2.4 m long and 5.5 m wide. The bridge had 280 piers consisting of four vertical posts placed at a distance of 1.2 m, and two smaller slanted post at the ends. The vertical posts were square with sides of 30 x 30 cm and up to 6 m long. Over the vertical posts were placed 5.5 m long, 25‚Äì30 cm high and more than double as wide horizontal girders. The girders were connected by longitudinal beams on which the deck of the bridge was built. The deck area covered 3,800 square meters, and it is estimated that more than 300 ha of oak forest was felled to construct the bridge. The purpose of the Ravning Bridge has been much debated, but later excavations in 1993 and 1996 revealed that it was used both as a trading bridge and a jetty for ships. In the Viking Age the water levels were higher in the Vejle River Valley and ships could navigate further inland and so dock closer to the important royal seat of Jelling. The width of the bridge allowed two trading wagons to pass each other.

Haldum is a village within the Haldum parish of the Favrskov municipality of mid-Jutland, Denmark, 20 km northwest of Aarhus.Larsen, Viggo (1998) Haldum Kirke. Haldum: Haldum Menighedsr√•d The town is home to the medieval-era Haldum Church. In 2004, Haldum Church became known as an archaeological site when the Moesg√•rd Museum conducted excavations in the area surrounding the churchyard, which yielded notable Viking Age and Early Medieval period findings.  Haldum Church the church' granite baptismal font, with the basin just visible at the top Haldum Church is a Romanesque style building constructed during the first half of the 12th century out of travertine limestone. The 1203 will of Bishop Peter Vognsen of Aarhus bequeathed the ‚Äúchurch and manor‚Äù to the canons of the Aarhus cathedral. Since then, the church has been modified multiple times. Vaults over the chancel and naves were constructed in the late Middle Ages, and a tower was added. In 1865 Christen Kiilsgaard oversaw a complete renovation, and added the current spire. The church bell is from the 14th century. The altarpiece in the church dates from 1599. The carved wooden pulpit was constructed in 1615. The church houses a baptismal font from the mid-16th century and is made of granite. The fonts brass basin was made in southern Germany around the same time. Moesg√•rd Excavations The Moesg√•rd Museum, based near Aarhus, was given permission to excavate the site due to a road construction plan in 2004 and it was able to excavate the area near the churchyard of Haldum Church. During this excavation, archaeologists found 16 inhumation graves and five cremation graves from the late 10th century. Because no visible traces of Christian worship were found, the graves are assumed to be pagan. The excavators from the Moesg√•rd Museum unearthed a series of typical Viking Age grave goods, such as pottery and knives. They also found evidence suggesting that at least some of the graves belonged to members of the social elite. Two graves were chamber burials. In one of the chamber graves, excavators found a Jelling style bronze ornament. In addition to this finding, the archaeologists also discovered two caskets which had once been brilliantly ornamented. On the southern end of the churchyard, a series of postholes indicates a 130-meter horizontal fence that predates the church. Although no further buildings have been found to have existed within the fence, its construction is speculated to have complemented the ‚Äúchurch and manor‚Äù complex referred to by Vognesen in his will. Haldum Church was constructed less than 200 years later on the same site as the Viking-age graves. Because churches were often built upon existing pagan sites where chieftains served religious functions, it is highly probable that Haldum had once been home to an aristocracy. It is more difficult, however, to determine whether the fence mentioned above reflects a link between a possible Viking aristocracy in the late 10th century and the builders of the church. Because one of the fence‚Äôs postholes had been placed inside a grave - a sign of disrespect in a family-oriented Viking Age culture \\\\- the church builders would probably have been strangers to the area.

It has now been culverted for most of the lower part of its course, which runs through Otterspool Park in Aigburth, Liverpool. The river had two tributaries, the Upper and Lower Brooks. The Upper Brook rose near the playing fields in Wavertree, flowing past, and inspiring the name of, the Brook House pub. The Lower Brook had a source in Wavertree Botanic Gardens, where it rose in two ponds near Edge Lane; both branches joined in present-day Sefton Park before flowing through a series of natural cascades into the Otterspool, a creek on the Mersey shore. The watercourse was recorded in the 13th century Chartulary of Whalley Abbey as the \\"Oskelesbrok\\", when it was described as forming the boundary of Toxteth, and flowing into \\"Oterpol\\".Baines, E. History of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster, 1836, pp.190-191 The name, also written as \\"Haskelesbroc\\" and \\"Hoskellesbrok\\" in the period, may contain a reference to the Old Norse personal name Askell.Ekwall, E. The Place-names of Lancashire, v 11, 1923, p.95 The brook later gained the name of the \\"River Jordan\\", probably during the 17th century when Toxteth Park was disparked and let as farmland.Nightingale, Rev. B. Lancashire Nonconformity, Heywood, pp.67-8 The first tenants were Puritan in religion and this has been suggested as the origin of the name \\"Jordan\\", as well as that of a nearby farm called \\"Jericho\\" and a rock called \\"David's Throne\\". Otterspool itself was one of the most important of the Mersey fisheries well into the 18th century, and was reputed to be the finest salmon fishery in the area.Otterspool Park, Liverpool Parks The course of the river was changed radically in the 19th century, when housing developments and parks were laid out and much of the watercourse was incorporated into a series of ornamental water features. The Upper Brook was dammed in Greenbank Park to form a lake, and both it and the Lower Brook were channelled into the Boating Lake in Sefton Park. Below this point, the river is currently visible near the gates of Otterspool Park but has been culverted from that point, though many features of its valley are still visible in the park. The area of the river mouth is now part of the Otterspool Promenade, where the river's flow is now piped to the Mersey.

Smaller steamboats were developed first. They were replaced by larger steamships which were often ocean-going. Steamships required a change in propulsion technology from sail to paddlewheel to screw to steam turbines. The latter innovation changed the design of vessels to one that could move faster through the water. Engine propulsion changed to steam turbine in the early 20th century. In the latter part of the 20th century, these, in turn, were replaced by gas turbines. Engine Room, illustrated in Harper's New Monthly Magazine, No. XII, May 1851, Vol. II Steamship generally refers to a larger steam-powered ship, usually ocean-going, capable of carrying a (ship's) boat. The engine room, to the right, is a concept drawing during the construction of the ship. The term steam wheeler is archaic and rarely used. In England, \\"steam packet\\", after its sailing predecessor, was the usual term; even \\"steam barge\\" could be used (Steam tonnage in Lloyd's Register exceeded sailing ships tonnage by 1865). The French transatlantic steamer was probably the last of her type to be equipped with sails, although she never used them. Steamships in turn were overtaken by diesel-driven ships in the second half of the 20th century. Most warships used steam propulsion from the 1860s until the late 20th century Terminology Screw-driven steamships generally carry the ship prefix \\"SS\\" before their names, meaning 'Steam Ship' (or 'Screw Steamer' i.e. 'screw- driven steamship', or 'Screw Schooner' during the 1870s and 1880s, when sail was also carried), paddle steamers usually carry the prefix \\"PS\\" and steamships powered by steam turbine may be prefixed \\"TS\\" (turbine ship). The term steamer is occasionally used, out of nostalgia, for diesel motor-driven vessels, prefixed \\"MV\\". Steam production =Nuclear= The production of steam by nuclear marine propulsion units is almost exclusively done in aircraft carriers and submarines, due to the regulations limiting distribution and ownership of the radioactive fuels used to power the plants. Nuclear systems present an additional danger due to the radioactivity of the fuel source and risk of reactor breach. =Boiler= Most steam propulsion systems use a boiler to produce steam. The boiler burns fuel and then transfers the heat produced into circulating boiler water.The Babcock & Wilcox Company (1928). Marine Steam. New-York: Bartlett Orr Press. Once the water is heated sufficiently it vaporizes into steam and can be used to power a steam engine that produces the mechanical energy that propels the ship. Power production =Turbine= Steam can be used to drive a high speed turbine that is connected through some means of transmission to the driving component of the vessel. These are more common on modern ships and were first used in 1897 on the steam ship Turbinia. Nuclear ships almost always use a turbine to harness the energy of the steam that they produce. Steam Driven turbines can either be used to directly power the vessel by means of transmission and gearing to a propeller, or the turbine can be used to generate electricity that is then used to power electric propulsion motors. =Piston steam engine= A piston steam engine uses trapped steam to move a piston within a cylinder, whose linear motion is eventually converted into rotational motion with the use of a flywheel or some other means.Steam engine. (2013). Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1. There are many variations on this concept that have developed over the years, but the general concept can be explained as above. =Multiple expansion steam engine= This type of piston steam engine harnesses the steam that has been used to drive a piston within the engine and uses it to drive one or more additional pistons. This configuration offers increased engine efficiency by improving the force produced per unit of fuel consumed. Propulsion methods =Paddle-wheel= A paddle-wheel is a device used to transmit the power produced by the steam engine of the vessel to the surrounding water. The wheel functions by using buckets or paddles attached to the circumference of a rotating wheel that displace water with their movement, ultimately propelling the ship forward. =Screw= Also known as a propeller, a screw is a device that uses sloped surfaces to transition rotational motion created by the steam engine into an axial force that moves the vessel forward. Systems that use propellers are regarded as more efficient than comparative paddle-wheels due to the reduced weight of rotating components and smaller equipment footprint. =Sail and steam powered= Early steam powered ships used both steam engines and the power of wind, like more traditional sailing ships. Ships such as these used paddle-wheels or screws to propel themselves when additional speed was necessary or wind conditions were not favorable. Uses =Military= Many steam-powered vessels have been commissioned by the military and equipped with weapons and various other equipment for the purpose of providing peacekeeping tools and a platform from which to operate international relations. Some types of steam turbine driven military vessels are long range submarines and aircraft carriers, although these ships can also be classified as nuclear powered vessels. =Commercial= Steam ships were used to transport goods and personnel across oceans and within coastal areas. Steam powered tugboats were created for the purpose of manipulating larger vessels at within ports or areas with limited maneuverability. Steam vessels were a practical solution for the international transportation of people. =Personal use= Many steam vessels have been built or fallen under the category of privately owned. These vessels can be luxury cruisers or decommissioned commercial vessels, especially now as the nostalgia value surrounding steam technology increases. Now steam vessels are not nearly as common as yachts with a more conventional power-train, mostly due to the scarcity and special knowledge required to operate and maintain these vessels. Danger High temperature steam can cause injury in humans on areas of exposed skin or by other means. Steam can cause burns through direct contact or by inhalation of vapors. Steam boilers also present an explosion hazard due to their high pressure contents. If over pressurization occurs and safety relief systems malfunction it is possible for a boiler to explode and cause damage to people and equipment surrounding it. Notable steam vessels =RMS Titanic= The RMS Titanic was the largest ocean-going passenger ship at the time of its creation in 1912. The ship sank only days into its maiden voyage from Queenstown in Ireland after it struck an iceberg and took on water, killing over 1,500 people. =Seawise Giant= The Seawise Giant supertanker was the largest steam-powered ship ever created and the largest ship ever built, before it was scrapped in 2010. It was over 450 meters in length. =RMS Lusitania= The RMS Lusitania was a steam-propelled passenger vessel sunk off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland by a German U-Boat in 1915. The sinking of the Lusitania played a role in involving the United States with the developing World War.Ballard, R., & Archbold, R. (1997). Lost liners. New York, New York: Hyperion. =HMHS Britannic= The HMHS Britannic was a successor to the Titanic, built as a luxury cruise liner. With the onset of World War I, the ship was drafted for wartime efforts and converted to a hospital ship. It was sunk in 1916 by a German naval mine.Ballard, R., & Archbold, R. (1997). Lost liners. New York, New York: Hyperion. =USS Monitor= The USS Monitor was a tactically valuable ironclad Union warship built in 1862, used to gain naval supremacy against Confederate ironclads until it sank later that year. The ship was heavily armed with a single rotating turret at the center of the ship and had very little surface area above water.

Its origin lies in the Sableuse ponds in Saint-Vianney while its mouth lies in the Sableuse River Bay on Lake Matapedia. This river flows into the regional county municipalities (RCM): * La Matapedia Regional County Municipality: municipality Saint- Vianney, Quebec and the unorganized territory of Lac-Matapedia, Quebec; * La Matanie Regional County Municipality: municipality Sainte-Paule. This course river of the Matapedia Valley is descending towards the Southwest; it passes through the territory of Sainte-Paule and Matapedia Lake (at the Eastern boundary of the territory of Sayabec). The Sableuse River flows into the bay of Sableuse River, located on the North shore of Matapedia Lake which discharge empties on the Eastern side in the Matapedia River. The latter flows Southeast into the Matapedia Valley up to the Restigouche River which flows East up to the west bank of the Chaleur Bay. The latter opens to the East on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Etymology The Sableuse River has officially carried the name since at least 1972, before which some referred to it as Matane River. The Sableuse River Bay, whose name was designated in 2003, was also formerly referred to as the Matane River Bay. Geography The Sableuse River is located in the La Matap√©dia Regional County Municipality in the Bas- Saint-Laurent administrative region. Its source, the Sableuse ponds, lie at Northwest of the village of Saint-Vianney. This source begins on the West side of the \\"Chemin des Towagodi Lakes\\" and is located at: * at the Western boundary of the West of Matane Wildlife Reserve; * Southeast of South Coastal of Gulf of Saint Lawrence; * from the confluence of the Sableuse River. From its source, the Sableuse river course is often forming many small coils. Its course flows over distributed in following segments: * West, up to the discharge (from the Northwest) of a small lake; * to the Southwest, up to the road path bridge of the 4th row; * Southwest up to the discharge (from the Northwest) of two little lakes; * Southwest up to the confluence of the Inconnue River (Sableuse River) (from the East); * Southwest up to the discharge (from the Northwest) of Portage Lake, Chaud Lake and Towago Lake; * Southward up to Crooked Creek (from the Northeast); * Southwest, cutting the Soucy Road, up to the confluence of the riverSegments of the river measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on Internet), Ministry of Natural Resources Canada. The river's mouth is located in the Seignory of Lac- Matap√©dia in the unorganized territory of Lac-Matap√©dia near Sayabec. Its outflow occurs in the Sableuse River Bay in Matapedia Lake, right in front of the Matane Island. This confluence is located at from the mouth of Matapedia Lake.

The French established the fortification to guard the essential lines of communication between the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong and to provide security for the densely populated and economically important Delta area against attacks by both the Vi·ªát Minh and any potential invasion from Communist China. The Line was to comprise 1200 separate concrete blockhouses able to withstand 155mm artillery grouped in 250 clusters of 3-6 blockhouses for mutual fire support over a span of . Each blockhouse was to hold a minimum of 10 men. In addition a defensive redoubt was to be constructed around a radius from the port of Haiphong ensuring its safety from artillery attack. All these new defensive lines were to be connected by roads capable of bearing 30-ton tanks. Construction commenced in late 1950 and was largely complete by the end of 1951. While the De Lattre Line provided some degree of security and formed an anchor point for French mobile operations outside the Delta, it was far from impenetrable and entire Vi·ªát Minh combat units could be easily infiltrated through the gaps between strongpoints.Windrow, p. 213.

After graduating from Lincoln-Way Central High School in New Lenox in 2004, she attended Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois for three years before transferring to Columbia College Chicago where she graduated in 2009 in Arts, Entertainment, and Media Management. During college, Molloy was an editorial intern at Pitchfork Media. Career Molloy briefly worked for Chicago musician Andrew Bird before taking a job at a Chicago-based ad agency. In 2013, she came out to management and her co-workers as transgender. Molloy launched parkthatcar.net in July 2012 as a way to document her ongoing transition. As time went on, the blog focused less on Molloy's personal transition, and more on transgender politics and current events. In 2014, Thought Catalog released Molloy's ebook entitled My Transgender Coming Out Story. Molloy has written for Rolling Stone, The Huffington Post, and Salon, and The Advocate.

Plot While most of ‚ÄúBut Always‚Äù takes place in New York City, the Chinese drama's blend of sentimentality and romantic fatalism is very Asian. American viewers who aren‚Äôt Sino-cinema buffs might balk, but Snow Zou's directorial debut does have a few noteworthy attributes: attractive stars, sun-dappled cinematography and an audacious payoff. Beijing tykes Anran and Yongyuan meet in 1982, when she transfers to his school. She's wealthier than her ragged classmates, who regard her with suspicion. The school bully assigns Yongyuan to follow Anran, a role he happily accepts for the next 20 years. One sign of his devotion is that he can always recognize her footsteps. The kids bond, in part because both lost their mothers in the same earthquake. (His was a peasant; hers was a doctor.) But then Yongyuan's guardian dies and his uncle takes him away. He's not allowed to say goodbye to Anran, a pattern that recurs as one or the other repeatedly vanishes. A decade later, Yongyuan returns to Beijing and encounters Anran, now a pre-med student. She's grown up to be played by Chinese beauty Gao Yuanyuan (‚ÄúCaught in the Web‚Äù). He's now portrayed by Hong Kong action star Nicholas Tse (‚ÄúThe Bullet Vanishes‚Äù), who's just as pretty as she is. The couple's reunion is idyllic, then awkward, then idyllic again. But Yongyuan gets involved in some shady business to raise money for Anran's post-graduate education. So when she's ready to leave for Columbia University, he's disappeared again. In Manhattan, Anran acquires a new boyfriend, a petulant painter called Michael (Qin Hao). She also works two part-time jobs in addition to her studies. (The movie is not subtle in suggesting that Beijing is now a better place to dwell than New York.) Yongyuan, who has gotten rich just so he can search for Anran, finds her through Michael's paintings of her. This leads to another sweet, luminously photographed reunion. But the couple will be torn apart twice more, and the final rupture will make or break the movie for many viewers. It's shamelessly contrived, but refreshingly outrageous.

As coordinator of Synergy of Women for Victims of Sexual Violence, she works to improve the lives of rural women, defend human rights and assist victims of war, especially women survivors of acts of sexual violence. This work is focussed in the province of North Kivu, and she has also campaigned for justice more widely in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). She has won considerable international recognition for her achievements. She has on several occasions been subject to threats of arrest or death. Earlier career Masika Bihamba obtained a national diploma in 1985, and subsequently trained in community development, activity planning, mediation and conflict management. In 2002 she contributed to a Human Rights Watch report on the condition of women in the east of DRC. Founding and work of Synergy In 2002 Masika Bihamba helped to carry out a survey of violence committed against women in emergency camps set up for people displaced by an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano. Following consultation with other organisations, a decision was taken to establish Synergy of Women for Victims of Sexual Violence (SFVS). The organisation is divided into three sections: a psycho-social section, a medical section and a legal defence section. Since then, SFVS has provided over 18 000 women with emotional, medical and legal support, and has documented the incidence of rape in North Kivu, calling for the arrest and trial of the perpetrators. Participation in other networks Masika Bihamba is also an active member of a wide range of other networks, such as Oxfam Novib, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Belgian Development Cooperation, Usaid, and other humanitarian, political and development agencies. Her organization Synergie des Femmes partners with international women's group Donor Direct Action. Testifies to ICC review conference Masika Bihamba testified to the 2010 Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kampala, Uganda. She pointed to the importance of implementing specific measures to support women who had become victims of sexual crimes and consequently often suffered from trauma and stigmatization. In her view, such assistance to date had been insufficient and should not be limited to financial aid. Attacks and threats * On 18 September 2007, six men, reportedly DRC Army (FARDC) soldiers, broke into Masika Bihamba‚Äôs house in Goma. The men reportedly asked for Masika Bihamba, who was absent, and began to search the house. One girl was sexually assaulted, and another was kicked in the face with such force that a tooth was knocked out. When Masika Bihamba returned home during the attack, the men fled. The alleged perpetrators were later identified as soldiers forming the personal guard of an FARDC colonel, but were never arrested or brought to trial, despite the submission of a legal complaint against them by Masika Bihamba nine days after the attack. The daughters later fled abroad for their safety. * On 27 December 2010, a magistrate from the Goma Military Prosecutor‚Äôs Department called Masika Bihamba to warn her that she might be arrested if she continued to denounce the human rights violations committed in eastern DRC. This followed her appearance on 28 November on the TV5 programme ‚ÄúAnd what if you told me the whole truth‚Äù (Et si vous me disiez toute la v√©rit√©), during which Masika Bihamba had spoken in particular about the impunity, sexual violence and human rights violations perpetrated by General Bosco Ntaganda. * In March 2011 Masika Bihamba received threats resulting from her human rights activities, in particular her calls for the rapid implementation of Section 1502 of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, dealing with transparency of sourcing of ‚Äúconflict minerals‚Äù from DRC. * On 14 March 2012, during an interview on BBC radio, Masika Bihamba again called for the arrest of Ntaganda. A few weeks later on April 10, she and other Congolese civil society leaders met President Joseph Kabila, repeating calls for Ntaganda‚Äôs arrest. On 27 April she received death threats by SMS text message. After Ntaganda‚Äôs men surrounded her youngest brother‚Äôs house, she fled from Goma for temporary exile in a European country. She returned to DRC in 2013 after Ntaganda gave himself up for trial at the International Criminal Court.

The first experience of Sendai with bombing was on March 10, 1945, when three B-29 Superfortress bombers from the Tokyo Air Raid dropped their bomb load on Mount Za≈ç for unknown reasons, killing 34 civilians, and an additional two B-29 bombers attacked Sendai Airport causing minor damage. On May 25, 1945, a photo-reconnaissance B-29 overflew Sendai at an altitude of 8000 feet, compiling a detailed map of the downtown area of the city. On July 10, 1945, another B-29 made an over flight of Sendai, this time dropping propaganda leaflets warning the residents of the city of its imminent destruction.

It is home to the St. Paul Saints of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, as well as home to Hamline University's baseball team. History Located in the historic Lowertown District of Saint Paul, the park is built upon the former site of a long-vacant industrial-use facility. In September 2012, the stadium was approved for $25 million in funding from the Minnesota Legislature. The remainder of the funding for the $64 million project was shared between the city and the Saints. The construction of this new ballpark was prompted in part by the deteriorating state of the Saints' original ballpark, Midway Stadium, which was built in 1982. Midway Stadium was located in an industrial area of Saint Paul, near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. A groundbreaking event was held by the Saints on May 10, 2014, with the first concrete being poured on the site. On September 8, 2014, it was announced that local Fortune 100 business CHS Inc. had acquired the naming rights to the ballpark. The Saints played their first game at the park on May 18, 2015, against the Sioux City Explorers in an exhibition match. The first regular season game was against the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks on May 21, 2015. On August 2, 2016, CHS Field hosted the American Association All-Star Game. In July 2017, the field hosted the Minnesota American Legion Baseball State Tournament, which was won by Tri-City Red, with Ham Lake also advancing to the Central Plains Regional Tournament.

The sanctions were imposed by the United States, the European Union (EU) and other countries and international organisations against individuals, businesses and officials from Russia and Ukraine. Russia responded with sanctions against a number of countries, including a total ban on food imports from the EU, United States, Norway, Canada and Australia. The sanctions by the European Union and United States continue to be in effect as of May 2019. In December 2019, the EU announced the extension of sanctions until 31 July 2020. The sanctions contributed to the collapse of the Russian ruble and the Russian financial crisis. \\"Russia‚Äôs rouble crisis poses threat to nine countries relying on remittances \\". The Guardian. 18 January 2015. They also caused economic damage to a number of EU countries, with total losses estimated at ‚Ç¨100 billion (as of 2015). As of 2014, Russia's Finance Minister announced that the sanctions had cost Russia $40 billion, with another $100 billion loss in 2014 taken due to the decrease in the price of oil the same year driven by the 2010s oil glut.Smith, Geoffrey. \\"Finance Minister: oil slump, sanctions cost Russia $140 billion a year.\\" 24 November 2014. Following the latest sanctions imposed in August 2018, economic losses incurred by Russia amount to some 0.5‚Äì1.5% of foregone GDP growth. In addition to the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of conspiring with Saudi Arabia to intentionally weaken the Russian economy by decreasing the price of oil.–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω: –º—ã —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–µ–µ, –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤—ã. By mid-2016, Russia had lost an estimated $170 billion due to financial sanctions, with another $400 billion in lost revenues from oil and gas.Pettersen, Trude. \\"Russia loses $600 billion on sanctions and low oil prices.\\" The Barents Observer. May 2016. According to Ukrainian officials, the sanctions forced Russia to change its approach towards Ukraine and undermined the Russian military advances in the region. \\"When the sanctions regime appeared to cost almost nothing to EU trade volume... together with Ukrainian resistance, it forced Russia to change its approach towards Ukraine... So far, an approach EU unity and strong solidarity with Ukraine, as well as resistance and reforms implementation, has proved to be the most efficient way to stop Russian military advances.\\" ‚Äì Liubov Nepop, the Head of the Ukrainian Mission to the EU (source ) \\"... sanctions and heroism of our warriors are the key elements of deterring the Russian aggression\\" --the president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko (source ) Representatives of these countries say that they will lift sanctions against Russia only after Moscow fulfils the Minsk II agreements. Background In response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, some governments and international organisations, led by the United States and European Union, imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. As the unrest expanded into other parts of Eastern Ukraine, and later escalated into the ongoing war in the Donbass region, the scope of the sanctions increased. Overall, three types of sanctions were imposed: ban on provision of technology for oil and gas exploration, ban on provision of credits to Russian oil companies and state banks, travel restrictions on the influential Russian citizens close to President Putin and involved in the annexation of Crimea. The Russian government responded in kind, with sanctions against some Canadian and American individuals and, in August 2014, with a total ban on food imports from the European Union, United States, Norway, Canada and Australia.  Sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals, companies and officials  = First round : March/April 2014 = On 6 March 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama, invoking, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and ordering sanctions, including travel bans and the freezing of U.S. assets, against not-yet-specified individuals who had \\"asserted governmental authority in the Crimean region without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine\\" and whose actions were found, inter alia, to \\"undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine\\". Executive Order ‚Äì Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine The White House, 6 March 2014. On 17 March 2014, the U.S., the EU and Canada introduced specifically targeted sanctions, the day after the Crimean referendum and a few hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing Crimea as an independent state, laying the groundwork for its annexation of Crimea by Russia. The principal EU sanction aimed to \\"prevent the entry into ‚Ä¶ their territories of the natural persons responsible for actions which undermine ‚Ä¶ the territorial integrity ‚Ä¶ of Ukraine, and of natural persons associated with them, as listed in the Annex\\". The EU imposed its sanctions \\"in the absence of de-escalatory steps by the Russian Federation\\" in order to bring an end to the violence in eastern Ukraine. The EU at the same time clarified that the EU \\"remains ready to reverse its decisions and reengage with Russia when it starts contributing actively and without ambiguities to finding a solution to the Ukrainian crisis\\". These 17 March sanctions were the most wide-ranging sanctions used against Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Japan also announced sanctions against Russia, which included the suspension of talks regarding military matters, space, investment, and visa requirements. A few days later, the US government expanded the sanctions. On 19 March, Australia imposed sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea. These sanctions targeted financial dealings and travel bans on those who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to Ukraine's sovereignty. Australian sanctions were expanded on 21 May. In early April, Albania, Iceland and Montenegro, as well as Ukraine, imposed the same restrictions and travel bans as those of the EU on 17 March. Igor Luk≈°iƒá, foreign minister of Montenegro, said that despite a \\"centuries old-tradition\\" of good ties with Russia, joining the EU in imposing sanctions had \\"always been the only reasonable choice\\". Slightly earlier in March, Moldova imposed the same sanctions against former president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and a number of former Ukrainian officials, as announced by the EU on 5 March. In response to the sanctions introduced by the United States and the EU, the State Duma (Russian parliament) unanimously passed a resolution asking for all members of the Duma be included on the sanctions list. The sanctions were expanded to include prominent Russian businessmen and women a few days later. = Second round: April 2014 = On 10 April, the Council of Europe suspended the voting rights of Russia's delegation.

The law includes 172 individuals and 65 entities in Russia and other countries for supporting and financing \\"terrorism\\" in Ukraine, though actual sanctions would need approval from Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. On 11 September 2014, US President Obama said that the United States would join the EU in imposing tougher sanctions on Russia's financial, energy and defence sectors. On 12 September 2014, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia's largest bank (Sberbank), a major arms maker and arctic (Rostec), deepwater and shale exploration by its biggest oil companies (Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas and Rosneft).

We don't want Russia to collapse. We want Russia to succeed. But Putin has to make a choice. These asymmetrical advances on another country cannot be tolerated. The international system will collapse if they are.\\" On 18 December 2014, the EU banned some investments in Crimea, halting support for Russian Black Sea oil and gas exploration and stopping European companies from purchasing real estate or companies in Crimea, or offering tourism services. On 19 December 2014, US President Obama imposed sanctions on Russian-occupied Crimea by executive order prohibiting exports of US goods and services to the region. On 16 February 2015, the EU increased its sanction list to cover 151 individuals and 37 entities. Australia indicated that it would follow the EU in a new round of sanctions.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkeviƒçius said that his country wanted to \\"focus attention on the unacceptable and cynical violations of international law and human rights in Russia. [...] It would be more effective if the blacklist became Europe-wide. We hope to start such a discussion.\\"  Opposition to sanctions  Italy, Hungary, Greece, France, Cyprus and Slovakia are among the EU states most skeptical about the sanctions and have called for review of sanctions. The Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n stated that Europe \\"shot itself in the foot\\" by introducing economic sanctions. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov stated, \\"I don't know how Russia is affected by the sanctions, but Bulgaria is affected severely\\"; Czech President Milo≈° Zeman and Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico \\"Slovak PM slams sanctions on Russia, threatens to veto new ones \\". Reuters. 31 August 2014. also said that the sanctions should be lifted. In October 2017, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ added that the sanctions \\"were totally unsuccessful because Russia is not on its knees economically, but also because there have been many harms to our own economies and, politically speaking, we have had no real forward progress regarding the Minsk agreement\\". In 2015, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras repeatedly said that Greece would seek to mend ties between Russia and EU through European institutions. Tsipras also said that Greece was not in favour of Western sanctions imposed on Russia, adding that it risked the start of another Cold War. A number of business figures in France and Germany have opposed the sanctions. The German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that the Ukrainian crisis should be resolved by dialogue rather than economic confrontation, later adding that the reinforcement of anti-Russian sanctions will \\"provoke an even more dangerous situation‚Ä¶ in Europe\\". Paolo Gentiloni, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the sanctions \\"are not the solution to the conflict\\". In January 2017, Swiss Economics Minister and former President of Switzerland Johann Schneider-Ammann stated his concern about the sanctions' harm to the Swiss economy, and expressed hope that they will soon come to an end.Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann hopes sanctions against Russia will soon come to an end. swissinfo.ch.

In August 2015, the British think tank Bow Group released a report on sanctions, calling for the removal of them. According to the report, the sanctions have had \\"adverse consequences for European and American businesses, and if they are prolonged... they can have even more deleterious effects in the future\\"; the potential cost of sanctions for the Western countries has been estimated as over $700 billion. In June 2017, Germany and Austria criticized the U.S. Senate over new sanctions against Russia that target the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, \\"Germany threatens retaliation if U.S. sanctions harm its firms \\".

Politico. 15 June 2017. In May 2018, the vice chairman of Free Democratic Party of Germany and the Vice President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Kubicki said that Germany should \\"take a first step towards Russia with the easing of the economic sanctions\\" because \\"this can be decided by Germany alone\\" and \\"does not need the consent of others\\". In February 2019, advisor to Municipal Councilor of Municipality of Verona, member of House of Representatives Vito Comencini said that the anti-Russian sanctions have caused significant damage to the Italian economy, with the result that the country suffers losses every day in the amount of millions of euros. =Efforts to lift sanctions= France announced in January 2016 that it wanted to lift the sanctions in mid-2016. Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry mentioned a possible lifting of sanctions. In June 2016, the French Senate voted to urge its government to \\"gradually and partially\\" lift the EU sanctions on Russia, although the vote was non-binding. However, in September 2016, the EU extended its sanctions, for another six months, against Russian officials and pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine. Norman, Laurence (11 September 2016).

As Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael T. Flynn was an important link in the connections between Putin and Trump in the \\"Ukraine peace plan\\", an unofficial plan \\"organized outside regular diplomatic channels....at the behest of top aides to President Putin\\". This plan, aimed at easing the sanctions imposed on Russia, progressed from Putin and his advisors to Ukrainian politician Andrey Artemenko, Felix Sater, Michael Cohen, and Flynn, where he would have then presented it to Trump. The New York Times reported that Sater delivered the plan \\"in a sealed envelope\\" to Cohen, who then passed it on to Flynn in February 2017, just before his resignation. On 19 June 2017, the EU again extended sanctions for another year that prohibit EU businesses from investing in Crimea, and which target tourism and imports of products from Crimea. In November 2017, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Thorbj√∏rn Jagland said that the Council of Europe considered lifting the sanctions on Russia due to concerns that Russia may leave the organization, which would be \\"a big step back for Europe\\". Jagland was also criticized of \\"caving in to blackmail\\" by other Council members for his conciliatory approach to Russia. On 9 October 2018, the council's parliamentary assembly voted to postpone the decision on whether Russia's voting rights should be restored. On 8 March 2019, the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated that Italy is working on lifting the sanctions, which \\"the ruling parties in Rome say are ineffective and hurt the Italian economy\\".  Other sanctions on Russia  In December 2012, the United States enacted the Magnitsky Act, intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009 by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system. 18 individuals were originally affected by the Act. In December 2016, Congress enacted the Global Magnitsky Act to allow the US Government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world. On 21 December 2017, 13 additional names were added to the list of sanctioned individuals, not just Russians. Other countries passed similar laws to ban foreigners deemed guilty of human rights abuses from entering their countries. On 29 December 2016, the US President Barack Obama signed an order that expelled 35 Russian diplomats, locked down two Russian diplomatic compounds, and expanded sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 United States elections. In August 2017, United States Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that imposed new sanctions on Russia for interference in the 2016 elections and its involvement in Ukraine and Syria. The Act prevents the easing, suspending or ending of sanctions by the President without the approval of the United States Congress. In January 2018 the EU sanctioned entities who participated in the construction of the Crimea Bridge: Institute Giprostroymost, the firm which designed the bridge; Mostotrest, which has a contract to maintain the bridge; Zaliv Shipyard, which built a railroad line to the bridge; Stroygazmontazh Corporation, the main construction company that built the bridge; a subsidiary of Stroygazmontazh called Stroygazmontazh-Most and VAD, which built the roadway over the bridge, as well as access roads.

In March 2018, 29 Western countries and NATO expelled in total at least 149 Russian diplomats, including 60 by the United States, in response to the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter on 4 March in the United Kingdom, which has been blamed on Russia. Other measures were also taken. On 6 April 2018, the United States imposed economic sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they control, accusing them of \\"malign activity around the globe\\", along with 17 top Russian officials, the state-owned weapons-trading company Rosoboronexport and Russian Financial Corporation Bank (RFC Bank). High-profile names on the list include Oleg Deripaska and Kiril Shamalov, Putin's ex-son-in-law, who married Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova in February 2013. The press release stated: \\"Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.\\" Other names on the list include: Oil tycoon Vladimir Bogdanov, Suleiman Kerimov, who faces money-laundering charges in France for allegedly bringing hundreds of millions of euros into the country without reporting the money to tax authorities, Igor Rotenberg, principal owner of Russian oil and gas drilling company Gazprom Burenie, Andrei Skoch, a deputy in the State Duma. U.S. officials said he has longstanding ties to Russian organized criminal groups, Viktor Vekselberg, founder and chairman of the Renova Group, asset management company,The 3 biggest names on the latest Russia sanctions list have all featured in the investigation surrounding Trump and Aleksandr Torshin. In August 2018 following the poisoning of Sergey Skripal,the U.S Department of Commerce imposed further sanctions on dual-use exports to Russia which were deemed to be sensitive on national security grounds, including gas turbine engines, integrated circuits, and calibration equipment used in avionics. Until that moment, such exports were considered on a case-by-case basis. Following the introduction of these sanctions, the default position is of denial. Also, on September that year a list of companies in the space and defense industry came under sanctions, including: AeroComposit, Divetechnoservices, Scientific-Research Institute \\"Vektor\\", Nilco Group, Obinsk Research and Production Enterprise, Aviadvigatel, Information Technology and Communication Systems (Infoteks), Scientific and Production Corporation of Precision Instruments Engineering and Voronezh Scientific Research Institute \\"Vega‚Äú, whom are forbidden from doing business with.

Also, the U.S. targeted persons involved in the 2018 Donbass general elections. On 2 August 2019, the U.S State Department announced additional sanctions together with an executive order signed by President Trump which gives the Department of Treasury and the Department of Commerce the authority to implement the sanctions. The sanctions forbid granting Russia loans or other assistance from international financial institutions, prohibition on U.S banks buy non-ruble denominated bonds issued by the Russia after 26 August and lending non-ruble denominated funds to Russia and licensing restrictions for exports of items for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons. In September 2019 pursuant to Executive Order 13685 Maritime Assistance LLC was placed under sanctions due to its export of fuel to Syria as well as for providing support to Sovfracht, another company sanctioned for operating in Crimea. Later in the same month, the United States sanctioned two Russian citizens as well as three companies, Autolex Transport, Beratex Group and Linburg Industries in connection with the Russian interference in the 2016 United States election. Consequences and assessment Foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Russia. In 2014 Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has admitted the sanctions have hurt the Russian economy, leading to a loss of \\"tens of billions of dollars because of the sanctions.\\" The sanctions introduced both by and against Russia slowed down the trade between Russia and EU, causing damage to both Russian and European economy. =Effect on Russia= The economic sanctions are generally believed to have helped weaken the Russian economy slightly and to intensify the challenges that Russia was facing. A 2015 data analysis suggested Russia's entry into a recession, with negative GDP growth of ‚àí2.2% for the first quarter of 2015, as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Further, the combined effect of the sanctions and the rapid decline in oil prices in 2014 has caused significant downward pressure on the value of the ruble and flight of capital out of Russia. At the same time, the sanctions on access to financing have forced Russia to use part of its foreign exchange reserves to prop up the economy. These events forced the Central Bank of Russia to stop supporting the value of the ruble and increase interest rates. Some believe that Russia's ban on western imports had the additional effect on these challenging events as the embargo led to higher food prices and further inflation in addition to the effects of decreased value of the ruble which had already raised the price of imported goods. In 2016 agriculture has surpassed the arms industry as Russia's second largest export sector after oil and gas. = Effect on US and EU countries = As of 2015, the losses of EU have been estimated as at least ‚Ç¨100 billion. The German business sector, with around 30,000 workplaces depending on trade with the Russian Federation, also reported being affected significantly by the sanctions. The sanctions affected numerous European market sectors, including energy, agriculture, \\"EU agro- business suffers from Russian Embargo \\". New Europe. 22 June 2015. and aviation among others. \\"Russia Sanctions Stall Europe's Business Aviation Market \\". Aviation Week. 5 May 2015. In March 2016, the Finnish farmers' union MTK stated that the Russian sanctions and falling prices have put farmers under tremendous pressure. Finland's Natural Resources Institute LUKE has estimated that last year farmers saw their incomes shrink by at least 40 percent compared to the previous year. In February 2015, Exxon Mobil reported losing about $1 billion due to Russian sanctions. \\"Here's What Exxon Lost From Russia Sanctions \\". Forbes. 27 February 2015. In 2017, the UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jazairy published a report on the impact of sanctions, stating that the EU countries were losing about \\"3.2 billion dollars a month\\" due to them. He also noted that the sanctions were \\"intended to serve as a deterrent to Russia but run the risk of being only a deterrent to the international business community, while adversely affecting only those vulnerable groups which have nothing to do with the crisis\\" (especially people in Crimea, who \\"should not be made to pay collectively for what is a complex political crisis over which they have no control\\"). Russian counter- sanctions Three days after the first sanctions against Russia, on 20 March 2014, the Russian Foreign Ministry published a list of reciprocal sanctions against certain American citizens, which consisted of ten names, including Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner, Senator John McCain, and two advisers to Barack Obama. The ministry said in the statement, \\"Treating our country in such way, as Washington could have already ascertained, is inappropriate and counterproductive\\", and reiterated that sanctions against Russia would have a boomerang effect. Sanctions tit-for-tat: Moscow strikes back against US officials RT On 24 March, Russia banned thirteen Canadian officials, including members of the Parliament of Canada, from entering the country. On 6 August 2014, Putin bans agricultural imports from sanctioning countries for 1 year RT, 6 August 2014. Putin signed a decree \\"On the use of specific economic measures\\", which mandated an effective embargo for a one- year period on imports of most of the agricultural products whose country of origin had either \\"adopted the decision on introduction of economic sanctions in respect of Russian legal and (or) physical entities, or joined same\\". The next day, the Russian government ordinance was adopted and published with immediate effect, which specified the banned items as well as the countries of provenance: the United States, the EU, Norway, Canada and Australia, including a ban on fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, milk and dairy imports. Prior to the embargo, food exports from the EU to Russia were worth around ‚Ç¨11.8 billion, or 10% of the total EU exports to Russia. Food exports from the United States to Russia were worth around ‚Ç¨972 million. Food exports from Canada were worth around ‚Ç¨385 million. Food exports from Australia, mainly meat and live cattle, were worth around ‚Ç¨170 million per year. Russia had previously taken a position that it would not engage in \\"tit-for-tat\\" sanctions, but, announcing the embargo, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said, \\"There is nothing good in sanctions and it was not an easy decision to take, but we had to do it.\\" He indicated that sanctions relating to the transport manufacturing sector were also being considered. United States Treasury spokesperson David Cohen said that sanctions affecting access to food were \\"not something that the US and its allies would ever do\\". On the same day, Russia announced a ban on the use of its airspace by Ukrainian aircraft. In January 2015, it became clear that Russian authorities would not allow a Member of the European Parliament, Lithuanian MEP Gabrielius Landsbergis, make a visit to Moscow due to political reasons. In March 2015, Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete and Speaker of the Polish Senate Bogdan Borusewicz were both denied entry into Russia under the existing sanctions regime, and were thus unable to attend the funeral of murdered opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. After a member of the German Bundestag was denied entry into Russia in May 2015, Russia released a blacklist to European Union governments of 89 politicians and officials from the EU who are not allowed entry into Russia under the present sanctions regime. Russia asked for the blacklist to not be made public. The list is said to include eight Swedes, as well as two MPs and two MEPs from the Netherlands. Finland's national broadcaster Yle published a leaked German version of the list. In response to this publication, British politician Malcolm Rifkind (whose name was included on the Russian list) commented: \\"It shows we are making an impact because they wouldn't have reacted unless they felt very sore at what had happened. Once sanctions were extended, they've had a major impact on the Russian economy. This has happened at a time when the oil price has collapsed and therefore a main source of revenue for Mr Putin has disappeared. That's pretty important when it comes to his attempts to build up his military might and to force his neighbours to do what they're told.\\" He added, \\"If there had to be such a ban, I am rather proud to be on it ‚Äì I'd be rather miffed if I wasn't.\\" Another person on the list, Swedish MEP Gunnar H√∂kmark, remarked that he was proud to be on the list and said \\"a regime that does this does it because it is afraid, and at heart it is weak\\". With regard to Russia's entry ban on European politicians, a spokesperson from the EU said, \\"The list with 89 names has now been shared by the Russian authorities. We don't have any other information on legal basis, criteria and process of this decision. We consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification and transparency.\\" On 29 June 2016, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree that extended the embargo on the countries already sanctioned until 31 December 2017. –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª —É–∫–∞–∑ –æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä—Å–∞–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–π TASS, 29 June 2016. According to a 2020 study, the Russian counter-sanctions did not just serve Russia's foreign policy goals, but also facilitated Russia's protectionist policy. List of sanctioned individuals Sanctioned individuals include notable and high-level central government personnel and businessmen on all sides.

He became known for using his political campaigns to promote segregation.Thompson obituary, New Orleans Times-Picayune, February 16, 1976; pp. 1, 12 Thompson opposed civil rights legislation and declared himself the Imperial Wizard of his individual one-man KKK, which he dubbed at times as the \\"Fraternal Order of the Klan\\" or the \\"Universal Klan\\". In the Democratic gubernatorial primary elections held on December 5, 1959, and December 7, 1963, Thompson polled 4,000 and 3,343 votes, respectively, and finished each time with less than 1 percent of the vote. Nominated and elected were Jimmie Davis and John McKeithen, respectively. Thompson filed in the Democratic mayoral primaries of 1965 and 1969, having received just 2,121 votes (1.3 percent) and 1,248 ballots (0.73 percent), respectively. Nominated and elected were Victor H. Schiro and Moon Landrieu, respectively.Louisiana Secretary of State, Election returns, December 5, 1959, December 7, 1963, November 6, 1965, and November 8, 1969 In 1967, Thompson again opposed McKeithen, who sought reelection as governor under an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution approved by voters the previous year. On November 1, 1975, he challenged the reelection of his fellow Democrat, Governor Edwin Edwards, winner of the state's first ever nonpartisan blanket primary. Meanwhile, in 1973, Thompson challenged the reelection of Mayor Landrieu.Louisiana Secretary of State, Election returns, November 4, 1967, October 1, 1973, and November 1, 1975 Thompson normally spent virtually no money in his political campaigns other than his filing fee and limited transportation expense incurred to meet with voters. In his campaigns, Thompson frequently used the slogan, \\"Put the Axes to the Taxes\\". In February 1967, Thompson served as master of ceremonies for a meeting of the Crescent City chapter of the National States' Rights Party, a different group from the Louisiana State's Rights Party which in 1960 had opposed the election of both John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon for U.S. President, though the Kennedy- Johnson ticket carried the state by plurality. The main speaker at the meeting was J. B. Stoner of Georgia, a staunch critic of both national parties regarding desegregation in the United States.New Orleans Times-Picayune, February 20, 1967, section 3, p. 16 In 1980, Stoner was convicted of the 1958 bombing of the African-American Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. He eventually served three-and-a-half years of a ten-year prison sentence. On January 19, 1972, on the birthday of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Thompson and a fellow segregationist, his long-term friend and mentor Rene LaCoste (not to be confused with the French tennis player Ren√© Lacoste), clashed with a group of Black Panthers at the Lee Monument in New Orleans. With a baritone voice, LaCoste had years earlier performed in an opera company in New York City. Then eighty-nine years of age, he was described as \\"dapper in seersucker slacks and navy sports jacket\\" and with a \\"white mustache and goatee\\" resembling Colonel Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken. LaCoste and Thompson dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a Confederate battle flag at the monument. The Black Panthers began throwing bricks at the pair, but the police arrived in time to prevent serious injury. At the time of the Thompson/LaCoste confrontation with the Black Panthers, David Duke, then a Klansman who served from 1989 to 1992 in the Louisiana House of Representatives, had been jailed in New Orleans for \\"inciting to riot\\". Thompson died in New Orleans early in 1976 at the age of sixty-four.

First, base pins were set up at a level behind the mountain aligned with the tunnel route so that the tunnel could be blasted to the width needed. Then air compressors were used to drill through the mountain. If these air compressors broke down, then metal chisels were hammered into the rock, explosives inserted and then the rock was blasted to make way for track-laying.

Built sometime between 1823 and 1828, it is a rare well-preserved example of an early rural textile mill in New England, and was the business around which the city rose. The mill was in active use for the production of textiles until 1969, undergoing some modest alterations as well as the modernization of its power plant. It was opened as a museum in 1991, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description and history The Belknap- Sulloway Mill is located on the east side of downtown Laconia, between Beacon Street East and the Winnipesaukee River, which historically provided the power for the mill. It is a 3-1/2 story brick structure, with a stepped gable roof that has a band of clerestory windows parallel to the ridge on each side. There are slender chimneys at each end, and a wooden cupola at the center which houses a bell. The north-facing main facade is nine bays wide, with a central rectangular projection housing a staircase. Windows are set in plain rectangular openings. The rear of the building has several smaller single- story brick ells. The first mill to stand at this site was a wood frame structure built in 1811, when the area was part of Meredith, New Hampshire. That mill burned in 1823, and this building, its replacement, was reported to be in full operation by 1828. The bell in the cupola is believed to be a recasting of the original mill's bell. Unlike later mills, which used more fire-resistant materials, its interior uses joisted floor construction. Alterations to the structure since its construction include the addition of the door to the stair tower (before 1875) and the ells, which include a c. 1900 addition housing three power turbines. This mill, along with the nearby Busiel-Seeburg Mill, were responsible for the growth of the area (originally known as Meredith Bridge) into what is now Laconia. It remained in active use until 1969, and opened as a museum in 1991.

It targeted an upper middle class or upper class market, mainly of women, giving advice on home decoration. The distinction between editorial content and advertising was blurred. History John Bayne Maclean purchased the magazine in 1925. From then until January 1960 Maclean-Hunter published thirty seven volumes of the magazine. In 1930 Maclean-Hunter published the 242-page Canadian homes and gardens : book of houses. Canadian Homes and Gardens was sold in 1962. It was succeeded by Canadian Homes. This magazine, devoted to interior decoration, was published by Maclean-Hunter until 1978. Audience Canadian Homes and Gardens targeted urban readers from the upper and upper-middle classes. It competed with U.S. magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens, publishing feature articles on home planning and \\"gracious living\\". In the 1920s Canadian Homes and Gardens carried stories and illustrations of developments in furniture and appliance design, including Art Deco styles. At this time Art Deco was associated with a wealthy elite who want to be seen as modern and cosmopolitan. During the Great Depression, the magazine painted an upbeat picture when describing the 1933-34 radios, linking them to high culture, adventure and the home: Lorrie Dunington-Grubb (1877‚Äì1945), a Toronto-based landscape architect who co-founded Sheridan Nurseries, wrote articles on garden design for Canadian Homes and Gardens. The magazine also helped to promote Canadian nationhood through the concept of a popular Canadian culture expressed in terms of residential aesthetics. Thus in July 1929 Canadian Homes and Gardens published an article on a project by the architect Elizabeth Lalor Harding to convert a farmhouse in the Muskoka region into a summer residence. She was interested in developing a Canadian style of architecture. Around 1945 the Greater Vancouver region emerged as a center of architectural modernism, with elegant and innovative designs. This regional style was given extensive coverage in Canadian Homes and Gardens. Advertising The boundary between editorial content and advertisements was blurred, since the purpose of the magazine was to help the reader choose what to buy. Articles were complemented by advertisements for related products, and were spread through the magazine. The reader had to work through many pages of advertisements to read an entire article. The magazine devoted an entire issue to the modernist movement of interior decoration, promoting a show of art moderne by the T. Eaton Company, a chain of department stores. Eaton's College Street was called \\"one of the few great stores of the world\\", and was presented as the authority on good taste for middle class urban women. In 1930 an issue of Canadian Homes and Gardens had several pages devoted to the period furniture rooms in the Eaton's College Street store in Toronto. According to the magazine, The magazine avoided controversy. In 1954-55 there was disagreement between the male-dominated National Industrial Design Council and the Consumers' Association of Canada (CAC), whose members were mostly women. The Design Council refused to require performance testing, and routinely gave awards to products that women in the CAC thought were faulty, but refused awards to products the CAC favored. Kathleen Harrison of the CAC wrote an article discussing the issue called \\"How Good is Design Award Merchandise\\", but Canadian Homes and Gardens decided not to publish it. The CAC was given the message that women were expected to accept product designs, not contribute to them.

In the run up to World War I, some locals circulated a rumor that German-born Jahnz was shipping large amounts of concrete to his new property to erect a German fortress. In reality, the concrete was being used to construct a modern creamery on 400 acres of the property.

In World War II it defended London during The Blitz and later served in the Middle East. Origin German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The fourth of these was 54th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RGA, (TA), comprising 160th, 161st and 162nd (City of London) AA Batteries, formed in July 1923 and headquartered in Putney.Frederick, pp. 754, 767.Litchfield, p. 164. It was assigned to 27th (London) Air Defence Brigade.Titles and Designations. As Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary. 1st AA Division was formed to cover London and the Home Counties in 1935, and the 54th AA Brigade was reassigned to 26th (London) AA Group within the division. The Royal Garrison Artillery had been absorbed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924; on 1 January 1939 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment', which allowed the 'AA Groups' to take the more usual formation title of 'Brigades'. World War II Edward Ardizzone recorded the early days of mobilisation at 54th HAA Regiment's drill hall at Putney =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. 54th AA Regiment formed an additional battery, No 312, at Putney on 1 April 1939, as part of the expandion of the TA following the Munich Crisis.Army List, May 1939. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. After mobilisation, a new 48th AA Bde was formed in South London on 28 August 1939, to which 54 (CoL) AA Regt was assigned.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files =Battle of Britain and Blitz= Mobile 3.7-inch AA guns in London's Hyde Park, 1939 In May 1940 the regiment was deployed manning 4.5-inch guns at sites in South East London:Operation Order No 15, in 99 HAA Rgt War Diary, 19 August 1939‚Äì31 December 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2389. * 160 AA Bty at Welling (site ZS6) * 161 AA Bty at Woolwich (ZS8) * 312 AA Bty at Dulwich (ZS14) and Clapham (ZS16), with Battery HQ (BHQ) at 'Woodhall' in College Road, Dulwich On 1 May 1940, detachments of the newly-formed 318 AA Bty of 99th (London Welsh) AA Rgt were sent to these sites for training on 4.5-inch guns, and then on 15 May, 318 AA Bty took over BHQ and sites ZS14 and ZS16 from 312 AA Bty. At the same time 162 AA Bty concentrated at Eltham (ZS7). An AA command post in action, by Ardizzone On 1 June 1940, along with other AA units equipped with 3-inch, 3.7-inch or 4.5-inch AA guns, the 54th was designated a Heavy AA Regiment.

Events April 13, 1970 marked the 100th anniversary of the granting of the Metropolitan Museum's charter by the State of New York. On April 10 the Museum hosted a reception for staff members, before which Director Thomas Hoving presented the Museum's ‚ÄúComprehensive Plan for the Second Century,‚Äù which would guide building and program efforts in the coming decades. On April 13, the Museum held an open house for New York residents from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., including a receiving line of political dignitaries, special programs, refreshments, and entertainment in the Museum and on its Fifth Avenue plaza. The Centennial Ball that evening was hosted by Museum trustee Brooke Astor and featured reduced ticket prices for staff members and their families. Four ballrooms were set up in the Museum, each decorated by a noted New York interior decorator around the theme of a specific historical event or artistic period. Publications and centennial initiatives In celebration of the Centennial the Museum published eighteen new books, twelve directly related to the anniversary and six to other aspects of its collections. Among them were Merchants and Masterpieces: The Story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, written by New Yorker staff writer Calvin Tomkins and published in 1970, which serves as an official history of the institution, and a centennial issue of the Metropolitan Museum Journal published to coincide with the celebrations‚Äô conclusion in 1971.

The films were selected by Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise founder and director Henri Langlois, from its archive of more than 50,000 films. Chosen for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, they included work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the Museum's first major undertaking in film. Television projects associated with the centennial included \\"Masterpieces of Fifty Centuries‚Äù narrated by noted art historian Sir Kenneth Clark, a one-hour NBC program prepared by Aline Saarinen, and a network television report each evening during the week of October 6, 1969 on one of the five centerpiece centennial exhibitions. Specially tailored Museum visits were organized for members of other museums and cultural organizations across the United States to see the Centennial exhibits and participate in related programming. An intensive advertising, promotion, and public relations campaign publicized the events to a wide range of visitors and distant supporters through newspapers, magazines, and other print publications, as well as television and local store window displays.

It is within the Katherine Town Council local government area. The name Emungalan is believed to come from an Aboriginal word meaning \\"Place of Stone\\" or \\"Stony\\". The area was officially defined as a suburb in April 2007, adopting the name from the former railhead settlement north of the Katherine River.NT Place Names Register , Northern Territory Government History Emungalan was surveyed in 1917, when works to extend the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway south to the Katherine River neared completion. The original settlement on the river at Knott's Crossing relocated closer to the railhead. Within a year of the line opening, by 1918 Emungalan was served by a post office and police station as well as a number of businesses. The permanent population was estimated at 20 people. At its peak the town grew to 200 residents, boasting a hotel, an airstrip and a racecourse. A school initially operated out of the railway station building to serve the district before a permanent facility was opened in 1923. The town declined rapidly following the completion of the bridge across the Katherine River in 1926, when the railway station along with many homes and businesses relocated to the current site of the Katherine CBD. The airstrip remained in use until 1930 when it was also relocated across the river. Present day A small cemetery adjacent to the abandoned North Australia Railway line is the most intact reminder of the former settlement and is listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register. The area around the junction of the Stuart Highway and Emungalan Road is now an industrial area, with some agriculture and rural residential development particularly around Leight Creek, a tributary of the Katherine River. The suburb has been identified as a future focus for further industrial development and medium term planning calls for upgrades to water and sewerage allowing residential subdivision. Kalano Aboriginal community is located in the east of the suburb, as is the Katherine Town Council administrative chambers.

In 2016, Sunny won the 61st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category Plot Sunny is the story about the foster children of the Star Kids home, a combination group home/orphanage facility. They struggle with both the everyday issues of growing up and those specific of being abandoned or orphaned children. Their only way out from their situation is the Sunny, a dilapidated old car in the front lawn of the home. The Sunny is used by the children to go magically wherever they want, travel the world, go into space, or just find a refuge from the troubles of reality.

He is a college student, but is aimlessly searching for his purpose in life Production Matsumoto stated that he has planned since his debut on writing a manga about his own experience living in a children's care home for six years when he was young, but he thought that it would be weird to start a career as a manga artist with a theme like that. Matsumoto also said that Sunny is not an autobiographical work, clarifying that there are parts close to his own experiences, while others were mostly made up, adding as well, that at first he planned on making it more autobiographical, but he could not make it work, so it wounded up being \\"half real and half fiction\\". For the series, Matsumoto decided to use the Kansai dialect for dialogues to make the story more light-hearted. Matsumoto's previous works have been noted for lack of female characters, whereas in Sunny they are more prominent, as Matsumoto was basing the work on his own experience and half of the kids at the home were girls. Matsumoto's wife helped him drawing the female characters. Publication Sunny is written and illustrated by Taiy≈ç Matsumoto. It was serialized in Monthly Ikki by Shogakukan from December 25, 2010 to September 25, 2014, when Ikki suspended its publication. The manga was later transferred to Monthly Big Comic Spirits on January 27, 2015. Sunny ended on July 27, 2015.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 7, 2014. It is the thirteenth Christmas episode of the show. Plot The episode begins with Comic Book Guy and Kumiko Albertson watching the Cosmic Wars Special, with CBG expressing shock and outrage that the special actually gets worse the more he watches it, and Kumiko stating he has every right to be angry. Homer plans to fulfill Marge's Christmas Eve wishes by leaving work on time and arriving home to celebrate Christmas with his family. However, after suffering a car accident on the way home, he stops for a quick drink at Moe's, and when he says it's time for him to get home Moe convinces him to stay there by honestly telling Homer how lonely and depressed he is. Homer loses track of time and when he finally gets home, Marge is enraged and kicks him out, saying she does not want him in the house on Christmas. Homer then leaves on an odyssey through a deserted and chilly Springfield, with Moe inadvertently compounding his sadness by being preoccupied with karaoke when Homer shows up to try and talk to him, and to add insult to injury, Homer's car gets towed with his cell phone frozen inside it. Meanwhile, Marge becomes depressed without Homer, but tells Bart and Lisa that she does not plan to forgive him. At that point, Moe, having found Homer's wallet that he left in the tavern, climbs down the 742 Evergreen Terrace chimney and tells Marge the truth about why Homer was out late on Christmas Eve. Marge immediately tries to call Homer and ask him to come home, but as he lost his phone, she ends up going out to look for him. Homer ends up at the miserable local movie theatre to watch a depressing Life is Beautiful-type of film alongside other lost souls like Kirk Van Houten, the Crazy Cat Lady, and of course Gil. After Marge searches through the city and Homer ends up at a depressing party for mall workers, they each have epiphanies: Homer says that being without his family at Christmas is much worse than being with them, and Marge says that she shouldn't always assume Homer is doing stupid things for no reasons. The two finally find each other at the party, reconcile and look forward to a happy new year. The final scene shows footage from the next episode \\"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\\". Reception The episode received an audience of 6.52 million, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"The moderate pleasure to be gleaned from ‚ÄòI Won‚Äôt Be Home for Christmas‚Äô comes from a show trying to wring some heart and laughs from a quarter-century of well-trod territory.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 2, 2014. Plot When Patty and Selma are forced out of their apartment while it is being fumigated, they invite themselves over to stay in the Simpson home, much to Homer's anger. The twins light up cigarettes, causing Bart and Lisa to cough severely. Homer makes a deal: if they smoke at all during their uninvited stay, Patty and Selma must leave right away. Homer installs smoke alarms all over the house to ensure this. Bad weather stops them from smoking outside, and after an unsuccessful attempt with e-cigarettes, which are legal and do not set off the smoke alarms, the twins go into a downstairs bathroom to smoke, seeing as Homer forgot to put a smoke alarm there, but they catch fire from the tap water. A gleeful Homer wastes no time kicking them out and dropping them off at a Dog Track, which they immediately take delight in due to the surrounding patrons' chain-smoking. Lisa informs Marge that the inflamed tap water is possibly a result of fracking, which she discovers that Mr. Burns is operating. She successfully calls on Democratic Assemblywoman Maxine Lombard to stop the fracking. Burns is furious at Lombard and storms into her office, but the two end up having sex and vow to continue their romance despite their political differences. On learning that he must obtain the mineral rights to all land in Springfield in order to resume his fracking operation, Burns gives Homer the job of marketing it to the citizens of Springfield. At a Town Hall meeting, Professor Frink warns about water contamination, but Homer promises $5,000 to every person who gives their mineral rights to Burns. When he is about to resume the operation, Burns discovers that Marge did not give permission to him, and thus the project is abandoned, infuriating many residents who were looking forward to the money. Knowing that he will lose his new job, Homer is angry at Marge, and Burns breaks up with Lombard. Lombard takes revenge on Burns, demolishing his mansion to use the land for various liberal causes, including Robert Siegel's National Public Radio. Burns plans an even bigger vengeance, and resumes his hydraulic fracturing at maximum power, causing earthquakes in the city. Marge pleads with Homer to shut it down, and he lights the inflammable water to burn the fracking plant down. On seeing that Homer and Marge can reconcile despite their differences due to their passion, Burns and Lombard get back together. During the credits, Burns and Lombard are seen having a conversation while lying in bed with their tablet computers. Cultural references Mr. Burns says to Maxine Lombard that she was the best woman he had ever been with, including Nellie Taft, the wife of President William Howard Taft. The episode \\"Homer the Smithers\\" had previously revealed that Burns' mother had an affair with President Taft himself. The episode was Jane Fonda's first voice-over work. Reception The episode received an audience of 4.22 million, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V.

The specific name sahulensis is derived from the Sahul Shelf, located between northern Australia and southern New Guinea, where the Australian humpback dolphins occur. The species was scientifically described on 31 July 2014 in the journal Marine Mammal Science. As of August 2014, there is no population estimate for the Australian humpback dolphin, but based on available sighting data it is put to \\"a few thousand\\". Appearance Australian humpback dolphins are slightly different from the other three humpback dolphin species in overall length, number of teeth, vertebrae and geographic distribution. The dorsal fin of the Australian humpback dolphin is lower and more wide-based than those of the Atlantic humpback dolphin and the Indian humpback dolphin, and its coloration is dark gray, while its closest humpback relative, the Chinese white dolphin, has distinctly white (often with a pink tinge) coloration. The Australian humpback dolphin also has a distinctive dark dorsal feature, resembling a cape. Known size for Australian humpback dolphins range from 31/2 ‚Äì 9 ft (1-2.7m). The dorsal fin is short, triangular in shape, and lacks the dorsal ‚ÄúHump‚Äù typical of Atlantic and Indian humpback dolphins. The body is mainly dark gray in color, with flanks shading to the light gray. A diagonal cape line extending from just above the eye and neck down to the urogenital area separates the dark back and lighter belly. White scarring and dark flecking on the head, back, dorsal fin, and tail stock are common in adult animals. Birth weight is between 88-110 lb (40‚Äì50 kg) and adult weight is between 507-550 lb (230‚Äì250 kg).Berta, Annalisa, editor. Whales, Dolphins & Porpoises: A Natural History and Species Guide.

The gestation period lasts 10‚Äì12 months, lactation may last more than 2 years and a 3-year calving interval is likely. Individuals may live for at least 30 years.Berta, Annalisa, editor. Whales, Dolphins & Porpoises: A Natural History and Species Guide. University of Chicago Press, 2015. Scientists studied the dolphins for 17 years before finally coming to the conclusion that S. sahulensis was a separate species within the Sousa genus. It was DNA that proved most useful to determining its classification. Genetic analyses found 7 unique mitochondrial DNA bases and a single nuclear DNA base supporting it status as a new species.http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/08/new-australian- dolphin-species-listed Food and foraging These dolphins are known to be opportunistic, generalist feeders, eating a wide variety of coastal-estuarine and inshore reef fish. Feeding may occur in a variety of habitats (mangroves, sandy-bottom estuaries, seagrass meadows, and inshore coral reefs) and involve animals dispersed over wide areas or tight groups targeting localized prey. These marine mammals are occasionally seen chasing fish into shallows and beaching themselves to catch their prey. Conservation and management There is no global population estimate but subpopulation estimates are in the low hundreds. Due to their coastal distribution, Australian humpback dolphins are vulnerable to a variety of threats including incidental captures in gill nets and shark nets set for bather protection, habitat loss and degradation, vessel strikes, pollution, and climate change. With an official species name, the new Aussie dolphin will have a greater chance of receiving special conservation treatment. Behaviour Australian humpback dolphins have been observed strand-feeding.https://www.thedodo.com/new-species-of-dolphin-filmed-- 706481673.html They are generally shy and elusive and tend to keep their distance from boats.

Population: History The village was inhabited in the Bronze Age (3rd and 2nd millennium BCE). This is evidenced by the excavation of 15 mounds in the immediate vicinity of Azovske. At the time of the annexation of Crimea to Russia in 1783 there was a small village in the vicinity named Kalay. In 1892, after the construction of the railroad to Feodosia, Kalay railway station was established. In the early 20th century the village grew, with about ten retail businesses, and numerous new homes. In the period from 1935 to 1962 it became a district center and was named Azovske in 1944. A knitting factory, repair shops, a milling plant, a small winery, a meat and dairy plant, a dairy, brick and tile factory and a power plant built in Azovske saw it develop into a fair-sized settlement, reaching a population of 1607 people in 1940. During the Great Patriotic War, the village was occupied by Germans from November 1, 1941 to April 10, 1944. In May 1944, the local population was deported. Azovske became an urban-type settlement in 1957, and in 1962 the district of the same name was dissolved and most of its territory was incorporated into the Dzhankoi Raion. Economy Azovske operates Azov Distillery, the WTO \\"Azovets\\" (woodworking and sewing production), and since 1962 it has operated the Azovske district power station, which serves the entire region. Residents of Azovske are served with a clinic, district hospital, nursery, a kindergarten, and there is a general school and children's music school. =Transportation= There is a railway station on the railway connecting Dzhankoi and Vladislavovka. Before the annexation of Crimea, the trains which followed from mainland Ukraine to Kerch and Feodosia were calling there. After the annexation, all these trains were cancelled. Azovske has an easy access to the road which connects Dzhankoi and Feodosia. By minot paved roads it is also connected to nearby rural localities such as Ozerki, Krasnodolne, and Prostorne.

Life experiences She was born in Bandla village of Bilaspur district in Himachal Pradesh in 1922. She started performing at the age of 8. She married at an early age like the other girls of the village which normally would have debarred her from singing and dancing. However, she persisted in folk performance despite the stigma attached to it. Her life Such was her talent that society slowly forgot her social stigma and started inviting her to perform on various occasions. She eventually became so popular that no function could be complete without her performance. Such was her impact that she came to be seen as an idol of romance. People started gathering from far away places for her performances and the same locality considered marriage ceremonies unceremonious without her performance and attendance. She was considered a matinee idol of her time. She was accompanied by a drummer and a wrestler (Pistu urf Basanta Pehlwaan) who also become a legend along with Devi. This couple, never legally married, faced a great deal of hostility from conservative society. They could enjoy her performances but could not accept her liberal behaviour. Devi later sacrificed her love and on request of Devi herself, Basanta Pehlwaan later married another woman. She continued performing till her later ages. She was not feeling well though and she discontinued performing because of her health issues in last few months of her life.

Born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, Alsop is a left-handed batsman who plays as a wicket-keeper. Tipped for a bright future and a big talent Alsop was educated at Lavington School, Alsop has played for the Hampshire Cricket Academy in the Southern Premier Cricket League since 2010, during this time Alsop has finished within the top 3 averages of the league on more than one occasion. In the 2014 season he finished up with the highest average in the league, 86.71 scoring 609 runs in just nine innings. In January 2013 he was called up to the England Under-19 following an injury to captain Shiv Thakor, playing four Youth One Day Internationals against South Africa Under-19s during the tour. In May 2013, he played two Minor Counties Trophy matches for Wiltshire against Lincolnshire and Suffolk. In that same month he was required as a substitute wicket-keeper for Hampshire in their Yorkshire Bank 40 match against Lancashire following an injury during the warm-up to Adam Wheater. During this YB40 game Alsop took a smart catch behind the stumps to dismiss Croft. For the start of the 2014 season, Alsop was awarded a development contract with Hampshire. This was a result of impressing against a strong Surrey attack in a pre-season friendly. Later in the season he made his senior debut in a List A match against Gloucestershire, however he was run-out for a duck by Craig Miles. The following day he made his Youth Test debut for England Under-19s against South Africa Under-19s, having been called up to the under-19 Test squad earlier in July. Alsop went on to impress immensely with the bat during the summer series against South Africa scoring 107 off 83 balls at Trent bridge, and then went on to score a half century the next day. Alsop is the 528th player to have played for Hampshire and on 15.9.14 he made his first-class debut against Kent at the Ageas Bowl. He was also a member of the 2014 LV county championship division two winning side in Cardiff. At the end of the 2016 season, Alsop was selected for the upcoming England Lions tour to the UAE and Sri Lanka in the new year. In Sri Lanka he shared a record partnership with Daniel Bell-Drummond in the fourth ODI.

Jones, first published in the United States in 1952 by The John C. Winston Company. This is one of the thirty-five juvenile novels that comprise the Winston Science Fiction set, which novels were published in the 1950s for a readership of teen-aged boys. The typical protagonist in these books was a boy in his late teens who was proficient in the art of electronics, a hobby that was easily available to the readers. In this story Ron Barron is typical in having a ham radio set up in a shed in the back yard of his parents' house.  Plot  Early one morning sixteen-year-old Ron Barron, accompanied by his pet collie, Pete, drives his hot rod out of the small town of Longview and up into the nearby hills. He is hunting for the object that his automatic meteor tracker had detected in the wee hours of that morning. After half a day of fruitless searching he finds what he was seeking, but it is not what he expected. It is the wreckage of a ship, a disc-shaped vessel two hundred feet wide and forty feet thick at the center. As he examines the ship, Ron encounters the lone survivor of the crash, a boy about his age, who has six fingers on each hand. Ron is wary at first, but Pete is friendly toward the alien, so Ron relaxes his wariness and takes the injured boy, still in shock, home with him. There he finds his girlfriend, Anne Martin, waiting to chide him over a missed tennis date. As he takes the alien boy into the house and up to the guest bedroom, Anne takes his car to get Doc Smithers, the Barrons' family physician. Smithers cleans and treats the boy's wounds as best he can and confirms the obvious: The boy is not of this Earth. With the boy awake, Ron introduces himself, Anne, and Doc Smithers to him through the simple point-and-say. The boy introduces himself as Clonar and shows a strange aptitude for picking up English in its proper form. At about the same time Pete brings Clonar a package of raw hamburger that he took from the refrigerator and Clonar eats it eagerly, giving himself the protein that he needs to heal properly. He then goes to sleep. Ron's parents are astonished when they come home and find out what happened. His mother, identified only as Mrs. Barron, is horrified. His father, George Barron, a lawyer, takes a more tolerant view, not quite trusting Pete's judgement of Clonar, but willing to give Clonar a small benefit of the doubt. He intends to resolve the matter by turning it over to an acquaintance of his, Colonel Middleton at Crocker Air Force Base, some fifty miles from Longview. Over the next few days Ron and Anne teach Clonar more English, which he picks up with astounding rapidity. By way of an astronomy book they learn that Clonar's home lies somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy. Clonar also confirms Ron's suspicion that he has been communicating with Pete, that his people have a slight telepathic ability to share simple thoughts with animals. Two days after Ron found the wreck, he and Clonar return to it intending to bury the bodies of the crew, including those of Clonar's father and brother. They find that the ship has been taken over by a military unit commanded by Captain Hornsby, a self-important opportunist devoted to practical realism, a cynical and amoral doctrine that imputes value only to things of immediate benefit. After Clonar gives Ron and Hornsby a tour of what's left of the ship the three of them come to a room where technicians are preparing the bodies of the crew for dissection. Outraged by the desecration, Clonar goes berserk, seriously injuring several men before the rest bring him down and beat him unconscious. Lieutenant General Gillispie comes from Washington to take over command of the project from Col. Middleton. He immediately pulls Hornsby and his men out of the ship and reprimands them for their behavior, but not before technicians have disassembled the ship's hyperwave radio, which Clonar could have used to call the fleet, which is presumably still looking for the lost ship. He also allows Ron and Anne to visit Clonar, who is effectively imprisoned in a Veterans Administration hospital. Other visitors try to obtain information from Clonar, but when Clonar finds out that Gillispie tried to get Ron and Anne to interrogate him, he escapes from the hospital and disappears. Nearly a week after Clonar disappears, Anne conceives the idea of asking Pete to find him, assuming that he still has a telepathic link to him. Pete leads Ron and Anne to a hidden compartment in the wrecked spaceship and there they find Clonar, unwilling to have anything further to do with Earth people. He has found several lifeboats intact and is trying to modify their hyperwave radios to call for a rescue ship. Later that night Ron gets a call from Clonar on his ham radio. Clonar made his hyperwave radios work, but they don't have enough power to send a signal to the alien fleet. With Gillispie's help, Ron and Clonar get permission to use the transmitters at Crocker Air Force Base to boost Clonar's signal. After days of feverish and desperate work, Clonar makes contact with the fleet commander, who sends a scout ship to pick up Clonar and take him home.  Publication history  *1952, US, John C.

She was the leading two-year-old filly of her generation in Britain in 1975 when she was undefeated in five races including the Lavant Stakes, Lowther Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. She failed to progress as a three- year-old and finished no better than fourth in her five races. She was then retired to become a broodmare and produced at least three minor winners. Background Pasty was a \\"neat, well-made\\" grey mare bred in England by her owner Percival Williams. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Raffingora, a very fast horse who won the King George Stakes and several major handicap races including the Cherkley Sprint Handicap at Epsom Downs Racecourse when he ran five furlongs in 53.89 seconds under a weight of 140 pounds. He was beginning to make a mark as a breeding stallion in Europe when he was exported to Japan in 1973. Pasty's dam Ma Marie was a granddaughter of the broodmare Scotia's Glen, whose other descendants included the 2000 Guineas winner Our Babu and the Eclipse Stakes winner King of the Tudors. Like Williams' other good horses, which included May Hill, Pasty was sent into training with Peter Walwyn at Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= Pasty began her racing career in the Dr Abernethy Maiden Plate over five furlongs at Wolverhampton Racecourse in June. Racing against moderate opposition she took the lead in the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths. In July she won a minor race over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and was then moved up in class for the Lavant Stakes over the same distance at Goodwood Racecourse. Receiving weight from her three opponents, she started odds-on favourite and won by one and a half lengths from the Ian Balding-trained Key to the Kingdom. In August, Pasty, ridden by Pat Eddery started at odds of 15/8 for the Group Two Lowther Stakes over six furlongs at York Racecourse. She was one of five fillies still in contention a furlong from the finish and drew ahead to win by a length from the Seaton Delaval Stakes winner Sweet Nightingale from whom she was receiving three pounds. In October the filly was again ridden by Eddery when she started at odds of 9/1 for the Cheveley Park Stakes, which was then the only Group One race in Britain restricted to two-year-old fillies. The race attracted an international field including the Irish filly Petipa (winner of the Moyglare Stud Stakes) who started favourite, and the French challenger Guichet. The British runners included Nagwa (already the winner of nine races), Outer Circle (Princess Margaret Stakes), Hayloft (Molecomb Stakes) and Western Jewel (runner-up to the colt Vitiges in the Group One Prix Robert Papin). Despite an unfavourable draw on the outside of the fourteen-runner field Pasty took the lead two furlongs from the finish and held off several challengers to win by a neck from the 33/1 outsider Dame Foolish with Solar a neck away in third. =1976: three-year-old season= Pasty began her three-year-old season in the Fred Darling Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April in which she finished fourth behind Rowantree, Solar and Manilata. In the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket, Pasty started 12/1 second favourite but made little impression, finishing twentieth of the twenty-five runners behind the French-trained favourite Flying Water. At Royal Ascot she again ran poorly, finishing last of the eight runners behind Kesar Queen. She was then dropped in class but did not recover her form, finishing unplaced in two handicap races over six furlongs. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Pasty was the top-rated two-year-old filly, a pound ahead of Dame Foolish and eight behind the leading colt Wollow. The independent Timeform organisation awarded her a rating of 122, six pounds below the French filly Theia. Timeform did not award the filly a rating as a three-year-old. Breeding record Pasty was retired from racing to become a broodmare and produced at least ten foals between 1978 and 1991. Pasty died in Australia on 12 February 1993. *Cornish Granite (grey colt, foaled in 1978, sired by Ragstone), won one race *June Fayre (bay filly, 1979, by Sagaro), failed to win in two races *Addaana (grey filly, 1981, by Mill Reef), won one race *Giovanni (grey gelding, 1982, by Star Appeal), failed to win in nine races *Fargad (colt, 1983, by Troy), failed to win in four races *Denomination (colt, 1985, by Dominion) *Dominion Fayre (bay filly, 1986, by Dominion), failed to win in six races *Myth and Merriment (colt, 1988, by Ahonoora) *Noble Choice (grey filly, 1990, by Danger's Hour), raced in Australia *Bold Zoffany (grey gelding, 1991, by Zoffany), winner in Australia Pedigree References Category:1973 racehorse births Category:1993 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 19-b ","title":"Pasty (horse)"},{"id":"43450236","text":"FC Aarau is a Swiss football club which are based in Aarau. during the 2014/15 campaign they will be participating in the Swiss Super League, Schweizer Pokal.

As of November 2016, it has undergone phase II clinical trials for both of these indications. It was discovered in a medicinal chemistry effort conducted at Roche starting from the results of a small molecular weight compound library high-throughput screen based on a Ca21 mobilization assay with human mGlu5a (Jaeschke et al., 2015). The high-throughput screen identified several mGlu5 antagonists such as MPEP, MTEP, and fenobam. In partnership with Chugai Pharmaceutical, basimglurant is currently still undergoing revision from previous drug trials as of November 2016. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Preclinical research trials found that basimglurant has a high specificity for the glutamate receptor mGlu5, and as a consequence of this specificity, also has a high level of safety. =Pharmacokinetics= Preclinical drug trials showed that basimglurant possessed a terminal half-life of 7 hours in rats and 20 hours in monkeys, indicating a dosing regimen of once daily in possible human patients. Research with rats and monkeys revealed a bioavailability of 50%, with additional studies showing that basimglurant has a rate of plasma protein binding of 98 to 99%. Clinical trials Phase I clinical trials for basimglurant began in April 2015, and finished in September 2015. 56 people were spread out among 4 healthy cohorts, a major depressive disorder cohort, and a placebo cohort. The trial was undertaken to study (and verify) the safety of basimglurant as a potential drug. Completion of this trial allowed for basimglurant to begin phase II drug trials. Phase II clinical trials have been undertaken, and a lack of efficacy was found overall. Improved secondary endpoints though of 1.5 mg dosage has prompted future clinical trials of the drug. =Future= Basimglurant has shown the desired characteristics of a drug with high bioavailability, few safety liabilities, and promise in the secondary endpoints of a phase IIb trial. Basimglurant will most likely undergo future iterations and attempt to pass drug trials again due to the large investment already poured into the drug to develop it this far. History Basimglurant was originally developed for the treatment of fragile X syndrome, but after failing phase II clinical trials Roche abandoned the drug in this field of application and is renewing basimglurant as part of a treatment for depression.

She announced in early 2014 her decision to come back to competition, this time under the Brazilian flag. She explained that fencing for Brazil, which has no other female √©p√©e fencer in the Top 100, allows her to aim for a qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro while pursuing a professional career. She went back training under Levavasseur and Laura Flessel. She was eliminated in the first round in her two first competitions since the 2012 Olympics, the Barcelona Grand Prix and the Rio World Cup, but she reached the quarter-finals in the Pan American Championships. In the 2014 World Championships in Kazan she was knocked out in the first round by Italy's Rossella Fiamingo, who would eventually win the gold medal. In the 2016 Olympics, Moellhausen reached the quarterfinals of the √©p√©e tournament, the best Olympic result Brazil ever had at this sport.Brasileira perde para francesa, cai nas quartas, mas faz hist√≥ria na esgrima At the 2019 World Championships, Moellhausen was the only non-top-16 female epee fencer to reach the final four. She won her first two matches comfortably, beating Poland‚Äôs Renata Knapik-Miazga 15-12 in the first round, and China‚Äôs Mingye Zhu 15-10 in the second. She won her round of 16 against Italy‚Äôs Alberta Santuccio. Moellhausen led throughout all the match and eventually won, 15-14. After a dramatic 11-10 extra time win over Lis R√∂ttler-Fautsch from Luxembourg in the quarterfinals, she overcame No. 3 seed Vivian Kong from Hong Kong, China in the semis, 15-9. She finally won the final in extra time 13‚Äì12 against World No. 11, Sheng Lin from China to claim her first individual World Champion title, and the first ever medal at a World Fencing Championship for Brazil. Nathalie promotes fencing for students in Brazil, performing social work activities in schools and in fencing clubs. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Moellhausen has conducted virtual fencing training sessions on Instagram that have been promoted by FIE. = Artistic and Lifestyle = Nathalie took a break from fencing in 2013, at which point she took over as artistic director for FIE for events held in Europe. In addition to artistic endeavours, Nathalie has ventured into modeling and social media branding. She walked the catwalk for Italian dressmaker Alberta Ferretti after winning team Gold at the World Championships in 2009. Of her work in fashion, Nathalie says \\"My idea is to develop fencing as not just a sport, but as an artistic form, like fashion.\\" She runs a fencing-related brand called 5 Touches, which offers lifestyle services in fashion, gastronomy, fitness, home goods, and more.

His artistic abilities were noticed early and he began taking lessons at the Imperial Academy as soon as he was old enough. In 1794, he officially became a student there, studying under Ivan Akimov and Grigory Ugryumov.RusArtNet: Biography He won a silver after his first year, and a gold medal the year following. In 1797, he graduated with a first degree certificate. He immediately became an assistant teacher and, a year later, was entrusted with teaching drawing to younger students.

In Canada, it usually refers to agreements between government agencies and representatives of Aboriginal peoples in Canada to jointly make land use and resource management decisions about a tract of government-controlled land or a fishery. Parks Canada co- manages several Canadian national parks with local Aboriginals has the result of land claims agreements. Ivvavik National Park in the Yukon was created in 1984 and is part of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. Likewise, the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement dictates co-management of Torngat Mountains National Park in Labrador, created in 2005. Proposals for new parks, such as Thaydene Nene National Park (proposed) in the Northwest Territories typically involve some kind of negotiations over co-management. Not only national parks, but also provincial ones also are subject to co-management; the Hay-Zama Lakes wetlands complex in Alberta is an example. A separate but related phenomenon is the joint management of parks by two governments without an Aboriginal partner. For example thefederal government and a province can jointly manage a park such as the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park in Quebec, as can two provinces such as Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The West Coast of Vancouver Island Aquatic Management Board is an example of co-management in fisheries. It consists of two members appointed by each of the Government of Canada, Province of British Columbia, the Nuu- chah-nulth Tribal Council, the regional districts, as well as eight non- government members jointly appointed by the levels of government from the wider community.

In particular it is the trend of competitive dynamics among payload transport capabilities at diverse prices having a greater influence on launch purchasing than the traditional political considerations of country of manufacture or the national entity using, regulating or licensing the launch service. Following the advent of spaceflight technology in the late 1950s, space launch services came into being, exclusively by national programs. Later in the 20th century commercial operators became significant customers of launch providers. International competition for the communications satellite payload subset of the launch market was increasingly influenced by commercial considerations. However, even during this period, for both commercial- and government-entity-launched commsats, the launch service providers for these payloads used launch vehicles built to government specifications, and with state-provided development funding exclusively. In the early 2010s, privately developed launch vehicle systems and space launch service offerings emerged. Companies now faced economic incentives rather than the principally political incentives of the earlier decades. The space launch business experienced a dramatic lowering of per-unit prices along with the addition of entirely new capabilities, bringing about a new phase of competition in the space launch market. History In the early decades of the Space Age‚Äî1950s‚Äì2000s‚Äîthe government space agencies of the Soviet Union and the United States pioneered space technology. This was augmented by collaboration with affiliated design bureaus in the USSR and contracts with commercial companies in the US. All rocket designs were built explicitly for government purposes. The European Space Agency (ESA) was formed in 1975, largely following the same model of space technology development. Other national space agencies‚Äîsuch as China's CNSA and India's ISRO ‚Äîalso financed the indigenous development of their own national designs. Communications satellites were the principal non-government market. Although launch competition in the early years after 2010 occurred only in and amongst global commercial launch providers, the US market for military launches began to experience multi-provider competition in 2015, as the US government began to move away from their previous monopoly arrangement with United Launch Alliance (ULA) for military launches. By 2018, the ULA monopoly on US national security space launch had evaporated. By mid-2017, the results of this multi- year competitive pressure on commercially bid launch prices was being observed in the actual number of launches achieved. With frequent recovery of first- stage boosters by SpaceX, expendable missions had become a rare occurrence for them. . But the new landscape did not come without a cost. Many space launch providers are expending capital to develop new lower-cost reusable spaceflight technologies. SpaceX alone had expended about by 2017 in order to develop the capability to reuse orbital class boosters on a subsequent flight. =1970s and 1980s: Commercial satellites emerge= Non-military commercial satellites began to be launched in volume in the 1970s and 1980s. Launch services were supplied exclusively with launch vehicles developed originally for various Cold War military programs, with their attendant cost structures. SpaceNews journalist Peter B. De Selding has asserted that French government leadership, and the Arianespace consortium \\"all but invented the commercial launch business in the 1980s\\" principally \\"by ignoring U.S. government assurances that the reusable U.S. space shuttle would make expendable launch vehicles like Ariane obsolete.\\" Little market competition emerged inside any national market before approximately the late 2000s. Some global commercial competition arose between the national providers of various nation states for international commercial satellite launches. Within the US, as late as 2006, the high cost structures built in to government contractors'‚ÄîBoeing's Delta IV and Lockheed Martin's Atlas V‚Äîlaunch vehicles left little commercial opportunity for US launch service providers but considerable opportunity for low-cost Russian boosters based on leftover Cold War military missile technology. DARPA's Simon P. Worden and the USAF's Jess Sponable analyzed the situation in 2006 and offered that, \\"One bright point is the emerging private sector, which [was then] pursuing suborbital or small lift capabilities.\\" They concluded, \\"Although such vehicles support very limited US Department of Defense or National Aeronautics and Space Administration spaceflight needs, they do offer potential technology demonstration stepping stones to more capable systems needed in the future.\\"; demonstrating capabilities that would grow in the next five years while supporting published list prices substantially below the rates on offer by the national providers. =2010s: Competition and pricing pressure= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + Launch market ! colspan = 2  Rocket ! style=\\"text- align:left\\"  Origin ! data-sort-type=\\"date\\"  First launch ! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016  2017  2018  2019 - ! style=\\"background:MediumBlue;\\"  !

Before 2013, Europe's Arianespace, which flies the Ariane 5, and International Launch Services (ILS), which marketed Russia's Proton vehicle dominated the communications satellite launch market. In November 2013, Arianespace announced new pricing flexibility for the \\"lighter satellites\\" it carries to orbits aboard its Ariane 5 in response to SpaceX's growing presence in the worldwide launch market. In early December 2013, SpaceX flew its first launch to a geosynchronous orbit providing additional credibility to its low prices which had been published since at least 2009. The low launch prices offered by the company, especially for communication satellites flying to geostationary (GTO) orbit, resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their prices. By late 2013, with a published price of per launch to low Earth orbit, \\"Falcon 9 rockets [were] already the cheapest in the industry. Reusable Falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude, sparking more space-based enterprise, which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale.\\" Falcon 9 GTO missions 2014 pricing was approximately less than a launch on a Chinese Long March 3B. Despite SpaceX prices being somewhat lower than Long March prices, the Chinese Government and the Great Wall Industry company‚Äîwhich markets the Long March for commsat missions‚Äîmade a policy decision to maintain commsat launch prices at approximately . In early 2014 the ESA asked European governments for additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.Continuing to face \\"stiff competition on price\\", in April seven European satellite operator companies‚Äîincluding the four largest in the world by annual revenue‚Äîasked that the ESA > \\"find immediate ways to reduce Ariane 5 rocket launch costs and, in the > longer term, make the next-generation Ariane 6 vehicle more attractive for > smaller telecommunications satellites. ... [C]onsiderable efforts to restore > competitiveness in price of the existing European launcher need to be > undertaken if Europe is [to] maintain its market situation. In the short > term, a more favorable pricing policy for the small satellites currently > being targeted by SpaceX seems indispensable to keeping the Ariane launch > manifest strong and well-populated.\\" In competitive bids during 2013 and early 2014, SpaceX was winning many launch customers that formerly \\"would have been all-but-certain clients of Europe's Arianespace launch consortium, with prices that are $60 million or less.\\" Facing direct market competition from SpaceX, the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced strategic changes in 2014 to restructure its launch business‚Äîreplacing two launch vehicle families (Atlas V and Delta IV) with the new Vulcan architecture‚Äîwhile implementing an iterative and incremental development program to build a partially reusable and much lower-cost launch system over the next decade. In June 2014, Arianespace CEO Stephane Israel announced that European efforts to remain competitive in response to SpaceX's recent success had begun in earnest. This included the creation of a new joint venture company from Arianespace's two largest shareholders: the launch-vehicle producer Airbus and engine-producer Safran. No additional details of the efforts to become more competitive were released at the time. In August 2014, Eutelsat, the third-largest fixed satellite services operator worldwide by revenue, indicated that it planned to spend approximately less each year in the next three years, due to lower prices for launch services and by transitioning their commsats to electric propulsion. They indicated they are using the lower prices they can get from SpaceX against Arianespace in negotiations for launch contracts. By December 2014, Arianespace had selected a design and commenced development of the Ariane 6, its new entrant into the commercial launch market aiming for more competitively priced launch service offerings, with operational flights planned to begin in 2020. In October 2014, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half. One of the reasons given for the restructuring and new cost reduction goals was competition from SpaceX. ULA had less \\"success landing contracts to launch private, commercial communications and earth observation satellites\\" than it had with launch US military payloads, but CEO Tory Bruno believed the new lower-cost launcher could be competitive and succeed in the commercial satellite sector. The US GAO calculated the average cost of each ULA rocket launch for the US government had risen to approximately in 2014. By November 2014, SpaceX had \\"already begun to take market share\\" from Arianespace. Eutelsat CEO Michel de Rosen said, in reference to ESA's program to develop the Ariane 6, \\"Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale.\\" European government research ministers approved the development of the new European rocket‚ÄîAriane 6‚Äîin December 2014, projecting the rocket would be \\"cheaper to construct and to operate\\" and that \\"more modern methods of production and a streamlined assembly to try to reduce unit costs\\" plus \\"the rocket's modular design can be tailored to a wide range of satellite and mission types [so it] should gain further economies from frequent use.\\" In 2015, the ESA was endeavoring to reorganize to reduce bureaucracy and decrease inefficiencies in launcher and satellite spending which had been tied historically to the amount of tax funds that each country has provided to it. In May 2015, ULA stated it would go out of business unless it won commercial and civil satellite launch orders to offset an expected slump in U.S. military and spy launches. , SpaceX had remained \\"the low-cost supplier in the industry.\\" However, in the market for launches of US military payloads, ULA faced no competition for nearly a decade, since the formation of the ULA joint venture from Lockheed Martin and Boeing in 2006. However, SpaceX was also upsetting the traditional military space launch arrangement in the US, which in 2014 was called a monopoly by space analyst Marco Caceres and criticized by some in the US Congress. By May 2015, the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified by the USAF to compete to launch many of the expensive satellites which are considered essential to US national security. And by 2019, ULA, with their next-generation, lower-cost Vulcan/Centaur launch vehicle, was one of four launch companies competing for the US military's multi-year block-buy contract for 2022‚Äì2026 against SpaceX (Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy), Northrop Grumman (Omega), and Blue Origin (New Glenn), where only the SpaceX vehicles are currently flying and the other three are all slated to make their initial launch in 2021. University of Southampton researcher Clemens Rumpf argued in 2015 that the global launch industry was developed in an \\"old world where space funding was provided by governments, resulting in a stable foundation for [global] space activities. The money for the space industry [had been] secure and did not encourage risk- taking in the development of new space technologies. ... the space landscape [had not changed much since the mid-1980s].\\" As a result, the emergence of SpaceX was a surprise to other launch providers \\"because the need to evolve launcher technology by a giant leap was not apparent to them. SpaceX show[ed] that technology has advanced sufficiently in the last 30 years to enable new, game changing approaches to space access.\\" The Washington Post said that the changes occasioned from multiple competing service providers resulted in a revolution in innovation. By mid-2015, Arianespace was speaking publicly about job reductions as part of an attempt to remain competitive in the \\"European industry [which is being] restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined\\" to respond to SpaceX price competition. Still, \\"Arianespace remained confident it could maintain its 50 per cent share of the space launch market despite SpaceX's slashing prices by building reliable rockets that are smaller and cheaper.\\" Following the first successful landing and recovery of a SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage in December 2015, equity analysts at investment bank Jefferies estimated that launch costs to satellite operators using Falcon 9 launch vehicles may decline by about 40 percent of SpaceX' typical per launch, although SpaceX had only forecast an approximately 30 percent launch price reduction from the use of a reused first stage by early 2016. In early 2016, Arianespace was projecting a launch price of , about one-half of the 2015 Ariane 5 per launch price. In March 2017, SpaceX reused an orbital booster stage that had been previously launched, landed and recovered, stating the cost to the company of doing so \\"was substantially less than half the cost\\" of a new first stage. COO Gwynne Shotwell said the cost savings \\"came even though SpaceX did extensive work to examine and refurbish the stage. We did way more on this one than [is planned for future recovered stages].\\" A 2017 industry-wide view by SpaceNews reported: By 5 July 2017, SpaceX had launched 10 payloads during a bit over six months‚Äî\\"outperform[ing] its cadence from earlier years\\"‚Äîand \\"is well on track to hit the target it set last year of 18 launches in a single year.\\" There were indeed 18 successful Falcon 9 launches in 2017.

By 2018, the monopoly ULA had held on US national security space launch was over. ULA responded to the Falcon 9 by beginning development in 2014 on the Vulcan rocket, a partly reusable vehicle powered by Blue Origin BE-4 engines, intended to replace its ageing expendable Atlas V and Delta IV rockets. In early 2018, SpaceNews reported that \\"[t]he rise of SpaceX has disrupted the launch industry at large.\\" By mid-2018, with Proton flying as few as two launches in an entire year, the Russian state corporation Roscosmos announced they would retire the Proton launch vehicle, in part due to competition from lower-cost launch alternatives. In 2018 SpaceX launched a record 21 times, exceeding the 18 launches in 2017; ULA had flown just 8 flights in 2018. In early 2019, the French \\"Court of Audit criticized Arianespace for what it \\"perceived as an unsustainable and overly cautious response to the swift rise of SpaceX‚Äôs affordable and reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\\" The Ariane 6 was found to be uncompetitive with SpaceX launch service provider options, and further found that \\"the most probable outcome for Ariane 6 is one in which the very existence of the rocket will be predicated upon continual annual subsidies from the European Space Agency (ESA) in order to make up for the rocket‚Äôs inability to sustain commercial orders beyond a handful of discounted shoo-in contracts.\\" , Teslarati, 12 February 2019, accessed 10 April 2019. While other competitors certainly do exist, the fact remains that that said increase in launch market competition can be almost singlehandedly attributed to the rapid entrance of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket onto the commercial launch scene. =Raising private capital= Private capital invested in the space launch industry prior to 2015 was modest. From 2000 through the end of 2015, a total of of investment finance had been invested in the space sector. of that was venture capital financing, of which $1.8 billion was invested in 2015 alone. For the space launch sector, this began to change with the January 2015 Google and Fidelity Investments investment of in SpaceX. While private satellite manufacturing companies had previously raised large capital rounds, that has been the largest investment to date in a launch service provider. SpaceX developed the Falcon Heavy (first flight in February 2018), and are developing the Starship launch vehicle with private capital. No government financing is being provided for either rocket. After decades of reliance on government funding to develop the Atlas and Delta families of launch vehicles, in October 2014 the successor company‚ÄîULA‚Äîbegan development of a rocket, initially with private funds, as one part of a solution for its problem of \\"skyrocketing launch costs\\". However, by March 2016 it had become clear that the new Vulcan launch vehicle would be developed with funding via a public‚Äìprivate partnership with the US government. By early 2016, the US Air Force had committed of funding for Vulcan development. ULA has not \\"put a firm price tag on [the total cost of Vulcan development but ULA CEO Tory Bruno has] said new rockets typically cost $2 billion, including $1 billion for the main engine\\". ULA had asked the US government in 2016 to provide a minimum of by 2020 to assist it in developing the new US launch vehicle. It was unclear how the change in development funding mechanisms might change ULA plans for pricing market-driven launch services. Since Vulcan development began in October 2014, the privately generated funding for Vulcan development has been approved only on a short term basis. The ULA board of directors‚Äîcomposed entirely of executives from Boeing and Lockheed Martin‚Äîis approving development funding on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Other launch service providers are developing new space launch systems with substantial government capital investment. For the new ESA launch vehicle‚ÄîAriane 6, aiming for flight in the 2020s‚Äî of development capital was requested to be \\"industry's share\\", ostensibly private capital. was slated to be provided by various European government sources at the time the early finance structure was made public in April 2015. In the event, France's Airbus Safran Launchers‚Äîthe company building the Ariane 6‚Äîdid agree to provide of development funding in June 2015, with expectation of formalizing the development contract in July 2015. , the Japanese legislature was considering legislation to provide a legal framework for private company spaceflight initiatives in Japan. It was unclear whether the legislation would become law and, if so, whether significant private capital would subsequently enter the Japanese space launch industry as a result.In the event, the legislation appears not to have become law, and little change in the funding mechanism for Japanese space vehicles are anticipated. The economics of space launch are driven, in part, by business demand in the space economy. Morgan Stanley projected in 2017 that \\"revenue from the global industry will increase to at least by 2040, more than triple the figure in 2016. This does not include \\"the more aspirational possibilities presented by space tourism or mining, nor by [NASA] megaprojects.\\" 2019 and beyond A number of market responses to the increase of lower-cost competition in the space launch market began in the 2010s. As rocket engine and rocket technologies have fairly long development cycles, most of the results of these moves will not be seen until the late-2010s and early 2020s. ULA entered into a partnership with Blue Origin in September 2014 to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180 on a new lower-cost first stage booster rocket. At the time, the engine was already in its third year of development by Blue Origin. ULA indicated then they expected the new stage and engine to start flying no earlier than 2019 on a successor to the Atlas V A month later, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half. One of the reasons given for the restructuring and new cost reduction goals was competition from SpaceX. ULA intended to have preliminary design ideas in place for a blending of the Atlas V and Delta IV technology by the end of 2014, but in the event, the high-level design was announced in April 2015. By early 2018, ULA had moved the first launch date for the Vulcan launch vehicle to no earlier than mid-2020, and by 2019, were aiming to launch in 2021. Blue Origin is also planning to begin flying its own orbital launch vehicle‚Äîthe New Glenn‚Äîin 2021), a rocket that will also use the Blue BE-4 engine on the first stage, the same as the ULA Vulcan. Blue Origin's Jeff Bezos initially said they did not plan to compete for the US military launch market, stating the market is \\"a relatively small number of flights. It's very hard to do well and ULA is already great at it. I'm not sure where we would add any value.\\" Bezos sees competition as a good thing, particularly as competition leads to his ultimate goal of getting \\"millions and millions of people living and working in space.\\" This decision was reversed in 2017, with Blue Origin saying it did intend to compete for US national security launches. In 2019, Blue was not only competing to offer the New Glenn launch vehicle for the US military's multi-year block-buy contract for \\"all [US] national security launches from 2022 to 2026\\" against SpaceX, ULA (for which Blue is on contract to provide the BE-4 engines for the ULA Vulcan), and others, it had \\"said the Air Force competition was designed to unfairly benefit ULA.\\" In early 2015, the French space agency CNES began working with Germany and a few other governments to start a modest research effort with a hope to propose a LOX/methane reusable launch system, tentatively named Ariane NEXT, by mid-2015, with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026. The stated design objective was to reduce both the cost and duration of reusable vehicle refurbishment and was partially motivated by the pressure of lower-cost competitive options with newer technological capabilities not found in the Ariane 6. Responding to competitive pressures, one stated objective of Ariane NEXT is to reduce Ariane launch cost by a factor of two beyond improvements brought by Ariane 6. Operational flights are scheduled to begin in 2020. SpaceX stated in 2014 that if they were successful at developing the reusable technology, launch prices in the range for the reusable Falcon 9 could be achieved in the longer term. In the event, SpaceX did not choose to develop the reusable second stage for the Falcon 9, but are doing so for their next-generation launch vehicle, the new fully reusable Starship. SpaceX indicated in 2017 that the single-launch marginal cost of the Starship would be approximately . In November 2019, Elon Musk reduced this figure to $2 million -- $900,000 for fuel and $1.1 million for launch support services.. After the mid-2010s, prices for smallsat and cubesat launch services began to decline significantly. Both the addition of new small launch vehicles to the market (Rocket Lab, Electron, Firefly, Vector, and several Chinese service providers) and the addition of new capacity of rideshare services are putting price pressure on existing providers. \\"Cubesats that used to cost to launch are now and going down.\\" According to an industry panel interviewed in October 2018, an industry shakeout is expected between 2019 and 2021 due to the excess supply compared to demand. Prices should reach stability once the new entrants have demonstrated their capabilities. In the first quarter of 2020, SpaceX launched over of payload mass to orbit while all Chinese, European, and Russian launchers placed approximately , and in orbit, respectively, with all other launch providers launching approximately . =Competition for the American heavy-lift market= As early as August 2014, media sources noted that the US launch market may have two competitive super-heavy launch vehicles available in the 2020s to launch payloads of or more to low-Earth orbit. The US government is developing the Space Launch System (SLS), capable of lifting very large payloads of from Earth. On the commercial side, SpaceX has been privately developing their next-generation Starship launch system, featuring fully reusable boosters and spacecraft, and targeting of payload. Development of the methalox Raptor engine began in 2012, and the first flight tests are scheduled for 2019. By 2014, NASASpaceflight.com reported: \\"SpaceX [had] never openly portrayed its BFR plans in competition with NASA‚Äôs SLS. ... However, should SpaceX make solid progress on the development of its BFR over the coming years, it is almost unavoidable that America‚Äôs two HLVs will attract comparisons and a healthy debate, potentially at the political level.\\" The Starship is planned to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, as well as the Dragon spacecraft, initially aiming at the Earth-orbit launch market, but explicitly adding substantial capability to support long-duration spaceflight in the cislunar and Mars mission environments. SpaceX intends this approach to bring significant cost savings that will help the company justify the development expense of designing and building the Starship system. Following the successful maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy in February 2018, and with SpaceX advertising a list price for transporting up to to low- Earth orbit, U.S. President Donald Trump said: \\"If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean literally. When I heard $80 million, I'm so used to hearing different numbers with NASA.\\" Space journalist Eric Berger extrapolated: \\"Trump seems to be siding with commercial space advocates, who say that, while rockets like the Falcon Heavy may be slightly less capable than the SLS, they come at a drastically reduced price that will enable much quicker, broader exploration of the Solar System.\\" Launch contract competitive results =Before 2014= Before 2014, Arianespace had dominated the commercial launch market for many years. \\"In 2004, for example, they held over 50% of the world market.\\" * 2010: 26 geostationary commercial satellites were ordered under long-term launch contracts. * 2011: Only 17 geostationary commercial satellites went under contract during 2011 as an \\"historically large capital spending surge by the biggest satellite fleet operators\\" began to tail off, something that had been anticipated to follow the various satellite fleets being substantially upgraded. * 2012: , the major launch providers globally were Arianespace (France), International Launch Services (United States) which markets the Russian Proton launch vehicle, and Sea Launch of Switzerland which markets the Russian-Ukrainian Zenit rocket. In late 2012, each of them had manifests that were \\"full or nearly so for both 2012 and 2013.\\" * 23 geostationary orbit communications satellites were placed under firm contract during 2013. =2014= A total of 20 launches were booked in 2014 for commercial launch service providers. 19 were for flights to geostationary orbit (GEO), one was for a low-Earth orbit (LEO) launch. Arianespace and SpaceX each signed nine contracts for geostationary launches, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was awarded one. United Launch Alliance signed one commercial contract to launch an Orbital Sciences Corporation Cygnus spacecraft to the LEO-orbiting International Space Station following the destruction over the pad of an Orbital Antares vehicle in October 2014. This was the first year in some time that no commercial launches were booked on the Russian (Proton-M) and Russian-Ukrainian (Zenit) launch service providers. For perspective, eight additional satellites in 2014 were booked \\"by national launch providers in deals for which no competitive bids were sought.\\" Overall in 2014 Arianespace took 60% of commercial launch market share. =2015= In 2015, Arianespace signed 14 commercial-order launch contracts for geosynchronous-orbit commsats, while SpaceX received only nine, with International Launch Services (Proton) and United Launch Alliance signing one contract each. In addition, Arianespace signed their largest launch contract ever‚Äîfor 21 LEO launches for OneWeb using the Europeanized Russian Soyuz launch vehicle launching from the ESA spaceport‚Äîand two Vega smallsat launches. The launch of the US Air Force's first GPS III satellite is expected no earlier than 2017 rather than 2016 as originally planned. ULA‚Äîafter having held a government-sanctioned monopoly on US military launches for the previous decade‚Äîdeclined to even submit a bid, leaving the likely contract award winner to be SpaceX, the only other domestic US provider of launch services to be certified as usable by the US military. =Since 2016= SpaceX's market share increased rapidly. In 2016, SpaceX had 30% global market share for newly awarded commercial launch contracts, in 2017 the market share reached 45%, and 65% in 2018. Five years after SpaceX began to recover Falcon 9 booster stages, and three years after they began reflying previously-flown boosters on commercial flights, the US military contracted in September 2020 for flying several US Space Force GPS satellite flights in 2021+ on previously-flown booster rockets in order to reduce launch costs by over per flight. Launch industry response In addition to price reductions for proffered launch service contracts, launch service providers are restructuring to meet increased competitive pressures within the industry. In 2014, United Launch Alliance (ULA) began a multi-year major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half. In May 2015, ULA announced it would decrease its executive ranks by 30 percent in December 2015, with the layoff of 12 executives. The management layoffs were the \\"beginning of a major reorganization and redesign\\" as ULA endeavours to \\"slash costs and hunt out new customers to ensure continued growth despite the rise of [SpaceX]\\". According to one Arianespace managing director in 2015, \\"'It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from SpaceX,' he said. 'Therefore, things have to change - and the European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined.' \\" Jean Botti, Chief technology officer for Airbus (which makes the Ariane 5) warned that \\"those who don't take Elon Musk seriously will have a lot to worry about.\\" Airbus announced in 2015 that they would open an R&D; center and venture capital fund in Silicon Valley. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier stated: \\"What is the weakness of a big group like Airbus when we talk about innovation? We believe that we have better ideas than the rest of the world. We believe that we know because we control the technologies and platforms. The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true. And we need to be open to others' ideas and others' innovations.\\" Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders said: \\"The only way to do it for big companies is really to create spaces outside of the main business where we allow and where we incentivize experimentation ... That is what we have started to do but there is no manual ... It is a little bit of trial and error. We all feel challenged by what the Internet companies are doing.\\" Following a SpaceX launch vehicle failure in June 2015‚Äîdue to the lower prices, increased flexibility for partial-payload launches of the Ariane heavy lifter, and decreased cost of operations of the ESA Guiana Space Center spaceport‚ÄîArianespace regained the competitive lead in commercial launch contracts signed in 2015. SpaceX successful recovery of a first stage rocket in December 2015 did not change the Arianespace outlook. Arianespace CEO Israel stated the next month that the \\"challenges of reusability ... have not disappeared. ... The stress on stage or engine structures of high-speed passage through the atmosphere, the performance penalty of reserving fuel for the return flight instead of maximizing rocket lift capacity, the need for many annual launches to make the economics work ‚Äì all remain issues.\\" Despite ULA restructuring begun in 2014 to decrease launch costs by half, the cheapest ULA space launch in early 2018 remained the Atlas V 401 at a price of approximately , more than more than a SpaceX standard commercial launch, which the US military began to utilize for some US government missions that flew in 2018. By early 2018, two European government space agencies‚ÄîCNES and DLR‚Äîbegan concept development for a new reusable engine aimed to be manufactured at one-tenth the cost of the Ariane 5's first-stage engine, Prometheus. , the first flight test for the rocket engine in a demonstration vehicle was expected in 2020. The goal was to \\"establish a base of knowledge for future launch vehicles that could, maybe, be reusable.\\" In the market for launches of small satellites‚Äîincluding both rideshare launch services on medium-lift and heavy-lift launch vehicles, and the developing capacity from small launch vehicles‚Äîprices were falling by early 2018 as more launch capacity entered the market. Cubesat launches that had previously cost had declined by March 2018 to , and prices were continuing to decline. New capacity from Chinese Long March and Indian PSLV medium-lift vehicles and a number of new small launchers from Virgin Orbit, Rocket Lab, Firefly, and a number of new Chinese small launch vehicles are expected to put more downward pressure on prices, while also increasing the ability of entities launching smallsats to purchase custom launch dates and launch orbits, increasing overall responsiveness to launch purchasers. As recently as 2013, nearly half of the world's commercial launch payloads were launched on Russian launch vehicles. By 2018 the Russian launch service market share was projected to shrink to about 10% of the world's commercial launch market. Russia launched only three commercial payloads in 2017. Technical problems with the Proton rocket and intense competition with SpaceX have been the prime drivers of this decline. SpaceX's share of the commercial market has grown from 0% in 2009 to a projected 50% for 2018. By 2018, Russia has indicated it may reduce focus on the commercial launch market. In April 2018, Russia's chief spaceflight official, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said in an interview, \\"The share of launch vehicles is as small as four percent of the overall market of space services. The four percent stake isn‚Äôt worth the effort to try to elbow Musk and China aside. Payloads manufacturing is where good money can be made.\\" The global launch market revenue from the 33 commercial orbital launches in 2017 was estimated to be just over while the global space economy is much larger at (2016 data). The launch industry is becoming increasingly competitive; however, to date there has been no indication of a large increase of launch opportunities in response to decreasing prices. Russia may be the first launch provider to be a casualty of over supply of launch services. By May 2018, as SpaceX prepared to launch the first Block 5 version of Falcon 9, Eric Berger reported in Ars Technica that, during the eight years since its maiden launch, Falcon 9 had become the dominant rocket globally, through SpaceX efforts to take risks and relentlessly innovate driving efficiency upwards. The first Block 5 booster flew successfully on 11 May 2018, and SpaceX then \\"lowered the standard price of a Falcon 9 launch from to about . This move further strengthens SpaceX‚Äôs competitiveness in the commercial launch market.\\" In mid-2018, no fewer than three commercial launch vehicles‚ÄîAriane 6, Vulcan, and New Glenn‚Äîwere being targeted for initial launch in 2020, two of them explicitly aimed at competitively responding to the offerings of SpaceX(although journalists and industry experts were expressing doubts that these all these target dates would be met.)) In addition to building new launch vehicles and endeavoring to lower launch prices, competitive responses may include new product offerings, and now do include a more schedule-oriented launch cadence for dual-manifested payloads on offer from Blue Origin. Blue Origin announced in 2018 they intend to contract for launch services a bit differently than the contract options that have been traditionally offered in the commercial launch market. The company has stated they will support a regular launch cadence of up to eight launches per year. If one of the payload providers for a multi-payload launch is not ready on time, Blue Origin will hold to the launch timeframe, and fly the remaining payloads on time at no increase in price. This is quite different from how dual-launch manifested contracts have been previously handled by Arianespace (Ariane V and Ariane 6) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (H-IIA and H3). SpaceX and International Launch Services offer only dedicated launch contracts. In June 2019, the European Commission provided funding for a three-year project called RETALT to \\"[copy the] retro-propulsive engine firing technique used by SpaceX to land its Falcon 9 rocket first stages back on land and on autonomous drone ships.\\" The RETALT project funding of was provided to the German Space Agency and five European companies to fund a study to \\"tackle the shortcoming of know-how in reusable rockets in Europe.\\" Effect on related industries Satellite design and manufacturing is beginning to take advantage of these lower-cost options for space launch services. One such satellite system is the Boeing 702SP which can be launched as a pair on a lighter-weight dual-commsat stack‚Äîtwo satellites conjoined on a single launch‚Äîand which was specifically designed to take advantage of the lower-cost SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The design was announced in 2012 and the first two commsats of this design were lofted in a paired launch in March 2015, for a record low launch price of approximately per GSO commsat. Boeing CEO James McNerney has indicated that SpaceX's growing presence in the space industry is forcing Boeing \\"to be more competitive in some segments of the market.\\" Early information on the Starlink constellation of 4000 satellites operated by SpaceX intended to provide global Internet services, along with a new factory dedicated to manufacturing low-cost smallsat satellites, indicate that the satellite manufacturing industry may \\"experience a supply shock similar to what the launcher industry is experiencing\\" in the 2010s. Venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson has indicated that it is not merely the lower launch prices, but the fact that the known prices act as a signal in conveying information to other entrepreneurs who then use that information to bring on new related ventures.

Route description SR 219 begins in the west at Greenwood Road in the town center of Greenwood. From this intersection, SR 219 proceeds eastward and crosses into West Paris where it intersects with SR 26\\\\. The two routes share a brief overlap before SR 219 continues northeast into Sumner. The highway continues through the center of town and intersects with SR 140 just feet shy of the Nezinscot River. SR 140 turns east along SR 219 and the two routes cross the river into Hartford. After a concurrency, SR 140 splits off to the north while SR 219 turns southeast and crosses into the northern part of Turner in Androscoggin County. SR 219 crosses SR 4 and intersects both the northern terminus of SR 117 and eastern terminus of SR 108 before crossing the Androscoggin River into Leeds. Continuing east, SR 219 intersects, and briefly overlaps with, SR 106 before crossing into Wayne and Kennebec County. SR 219 meets its eastern terminus at SR 133 shortly thereafter, located near the northern tip of Androscoggin Lake.

He served as Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery at the University of Edinburgh. His collection of anatomical specimens was donated to the Surgeon's Hall in Edinburgh and is now known as the Thomas Annandale Collection. Life Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 2 February 1838, he was third son of Thomas Annandale, surgeon, by his wife Elizabeth Johnston. He was educated at Bruce's Academy in Newcastle, and then apprenticed to his father. Continuing medical studies at Newcastle Infirmary, he matriculated in 1856 at Edinburgh University Medical School, and graduated M.D. in 1860 with the highest honours, receiving the gold medal for his thesis On the Injuries and Diseases of the Hip Joint. Annandale was appointed in 1860 house-surgeon to James Syme at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and was Syme's private assistant from 1861 to 1870. In 1863 he was admitted Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and became a junior demonstrator of anatomy in the university under John Goodsir. He was also appointed in 1863 a lecturer on the principles of surgery in the extramural school of medicine, and gave there a course of lectures yearly until 1871, when he began to lecture on clinical surgery at the Royal Infirmary. Annandale was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, on 15 July 1859, and Fellow on 12 April 1888; in 1864 he won the Jacksonian prize for his dissertation on The malformations, diseases and injuries of the fingers and toes, with their surgical treatment (Edinburgh 1865). Appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh in 1865, and acting surgeon there in 1871, Annandale became regius professor of clinical surgery in the University of Edinburgh in 1877, in succession to Joseph Lister, who then moved to King's College London. He was made honorary D.C.L. of the University of Durham in April 1902, and was surgeon-general to the Royal Company of Archers, from 27 May 1900 until his death. He joined as an archer in 1870. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1867. The newly graduated Richard James Arthur Berry came to work under him, as House Surgeon in the Royal Infirmary, in 1891. In his final years Annandale is listed as living at 31 Charlotte Square, one of Edinburgh's most prestigious addresses.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6 Annandale died suddenly on 20 December 1907, having operated as usual at the Royal Infirmary on the previous day. He was buried in the Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The grave lies in the northern section, backing onto the dividing wall to the original cemetery. Recognition The Annandale gold medal in clinical surgery was founded in his memory at Edinburgh university. Works Annandale published at Edinburgh, with papers in professional periodicals: * Surgical Appliances and Minor Operative Surgery, 1866. * Abstracts of Surgical Principles, 6 pts. 1868‚Äì70 (3rd ed 1878). * Observations and Cases in Surgery, 1875. * On the Pathology and Operative Treatment of Hip Disease, 1876.

Around 200 Bengali Hindus from Baria and nearby Kamaria were killed in the massacre, while hundreds more were injured.  Background  The village of Baria fell under Joydebpur sub-division of Dhaka district. At present it falls under Gazipur District of Dhaka Division. It is located at a distance of 8 km from the palace of Bhawal estate in Gazipur. In 1971, Baria was an almost exclusively Hindu inhabited village. The Pakistan army launched Operation Searchlight on 25 May. They set up a cantonment at the Bhawal estate.  Killings  On 14 May at around 1pm, local collaborators Awal, Hakim Uddin and Majid Mian led a contingent of around 500 Pakistani soldiers from the army cantonment at Bhawal estate to Baria. After entering the village, the troops spread out in all directions and opened fire on the villagers. Many died on the spot while others were seriously injured. The perpetrators looted the houses and set most of them on fire. Some of the villagers attempted to flee by crossing the Belai beel. The troops opened fire on them as well. The belongings of the fleeing villagers were looted by the Pakistan army and the collaborators. The army shelled a water pump at the Belai beel mistaking it as a cannon. The mayhem continued till 6pm. At around 7:30pm there was a heavy downpour. The indiscriminate shooting left around 200 villagers of Baria and Kamaria dead, including women and children. Hundreds of people were wounded in the gun fire.  Aftermath  As the news of army killings in Baria spread to nearby villages, the Hindus left the villages and fled to relatively safer places.

A raconteur, Sessler claimed to have met and become friends with a number of important figures in twentieth century music. He attributed his manic lifestyle of partying and drug use to being almost the only one of his family to escape extermination by the Nazis during the Second World War. Ronnie Wood described Sessler as a \\"sex-fuelled, vodka charged, coke mountain\\". Early life Sessler was born in Krak√≥w, Poland in 1923. He was one of seven children. He was aged 16, when the Nazis invaded Poland and Krak√≥w became the Third Reich's administrative capital of the region. Initially, a Ghetto was created for the Jewish population of 200,000 (within two years there would be none left) during which time many, including his Grandfather and youngest brother, who was four years old, were shot in the town square. Soon after, the regime began sending them to three concentration camps, Be≈Ç≈ºec, P≈Çasz√≥w and Auschwitz and Sessler and the surviving members of his immediate family were sent to Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp - from where he, once again, managed to escape, reaching Russia, only to find himself interned in Siberia. Breaking free once more, he made his way over to England where his fluency in English, Polish, Russian, German and Yiddish, saw him find work as a translator. After the war he returned to Poland, to discover his entire family were dead and their home had been destroyed, so he returned to London where, by chance, he found his elder brother Siegi had survived the war. It was he who gave him the funds and suggested he make a new start in New York. Jazz and the Beatles In New York, Sessler got a job, initially, as a waiter and started to frequent places such as Birdland. Sessler told Bill German that when he was working at Lindy's, he mixed with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, both friends of Siegi and Billie Holiday and it was at this time he began to procure but never sell drugs. His next venture would make him his first fortune, the Perma Weave hair piece. In 1961, Sessler began spending much of his time in West Germany developing a new type of car. It was there he claimed to have seen the Beatles in Hamburg when they were unknown, and to have become good friends with John Lennon and Eric Clapton. His development finally came to fruition when, in 1963, he set up, with several partners, The Amphicar Corporation of America, as President of the company. The Rolling Stones According to Ronnie Wood, Sessler loved being called \\"the ultimate Rolling Stones fan\\" and in his 70s, \\"the world's oldest rock and roll groupie\\". =Keith Richards= Sessler was particularly close to Keith Richards and Victor Bockris believes that Richards saw Sessler as a father figure. However, Sessler's lifestyle was problematic for Richards when later he was battling drug addiction. Early in his autobiography, Life, Richards calls Sessler, \\"an incredible character, my friend and almost a father to me who will have many parts in this story\\" and Sessler appears many times in Life. =Drugs= Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath remembered \\"I was also friends with Ron Wood and the guy who carried the Stones' pure pharmaceutical cocaine in the 60s and 70s, Freddie Sessler... I remember he put a huge mound of glittering, thick cocaine on a plate for me once\\" and Iggy Pop described him as \\"the kind of guy who can make a party happen\\". According to Ronnie Wood: \\"Freddie's real claim to fame was that he'd spent decades providing pharmaceuticals to everybody who was anybody in rock. I'm talking about a man who showed up with milk bottles full of high quality Mallencrodt and Merck.\\" \\"Merck\\" cocaine was his specialty but, as Marilou Regan notes, Sessler claimed never to have been a \\"dealer\\" or \\"pusher\\", and never to have charged anyone anything for drugs, and he never had anything to do with heroin. Julia Phillips, in You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again, remembered going backstage at a Stones' concert: \\"There is a smelly Israeli [sic] named Freddie who seems to be very important to everybody. He carries two medium-sized bottles filled with rock cocaine.\\"Phillips, Julia. (2002) You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again. New York: New American Library, p. 213. ISBN Sessler lent his name to the slang used by the Stones. The drugs he supplied were known as \\"Sessler‚Äôs Helpers\\" and his coterie of groupies, who changed from tour to tour, were known as the \\"Sesslerettes\\". Business ventures Sessler was involved in a number of dubious business ventures, including his Miami Venom Institute which used diluted snake venom to treat serious illnesses. One patient was the by then penniless Ronnie Lane of the Small Faces who was desperately searching for any possible cure from multiple sclerosis.Ronnie Lane's lonely battle: Former Face fights multiple sclerosis. Kurt Loder, Rolling Stone, 5 August 1982. Retrieved 26 August 2014. When his Miami institute was closed down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Sessler opened the Fairfield Hospital in Jamaica. He claimed that he made a fortune from selling aglets, another selling lightbulbs to the Empire State Building and that he had been involved with the Amphicar. Nothing ever worked out in the long term however and he said \\"I been a millionaire eight times, and I been broke eight times!\\" Personal life Sessler was married three times. He had three sons, all of whom are deceased. Sessler died on 18 December 2000 (Keith Richards' birthday), aged 77. He is buried at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

In World War II it defended the Thames Estuary, Medway Towns and Dover during The Blitz and later served in Iraq and North Africa. It then supported British Eighth Army and US Fifth Army during the Sicily and Italian campaigns until the end of the war. Origin German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in the 1920s it began raising five dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA). The last of these was 55th (Kent) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, raised in January 1925 at Tonbridge, Kent (later at Tunbridge Wells) with headquarters at Fort Clarence in Rochester. For a number of years the regiment consisted of this single battery (which was redesignated 163 (Kent) Bty in April 1936) and in turn formed the only unit of 28th Air Defence Brigade. In 1935 it was joined by the independent 166th (City of Rochester) AA Battery, which had been converted from a coastal defence battery (of Kent Heavy Bde RA) in 1932.Frederick, pp. 754‚Äì6, 769.Litchfield, pp. 112‚Äì3.Titles and Designations 1927.Monthly Army List various dates. One further subunit was added to 55 AA Bde in 1936 when 205th (Chatham & Faversham) AA Battery was transferred from 58 (Kent) AA Brigade, which had been formed the previous year by conversion of an existing Medium Regiment RA.458 (Kent) Regiment at Regiments.org As Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary. 1st AA Division was formed to cover London and the Home Counties in 1935, and 55 AA Bde was assigned to 28th (Thames and Medway) AA Group based at Kitchener Barracks, Chatham. On 1 January 1939 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment', which allowed the 'AA Groups' to take the more usual formation title of 'Brigades'. On 1 April 1939, as part of the doubling of the strength of the TA after the Munich Crisis, 205 Battery left the regiment to provide the basis of a new 89th (Cinque Ports) AA Regiment, and two new batteries were formed, 307 at Tunbridge Wells, and 308 at Rochester. During 1939 a new 6th AA Division was formed to be responsible for the air defence of the Thames Estuary, Essex, and North Kent, and 28 AA Bde including 55th (Kent) AA Regt was transferred to this new formation before the outbreak of war.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files World War II =Mobilisation and Phoney War= A 4.5-inch HAA gun at Chatham, 1939. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. Opportunities for action were rare during the Phoney War, but on the night of 22/23 November 1939 the HAA guns of 28 AA Bde ('Thames South') combined with those on the other bank of the river ('Thames North') to engage at least two enemy mine-laying aircraft that had strayed into the mouth of the Estuary.Routledge, pp. 374‚Äì5. By 11 July 1940, the Thames South AA layout operated by 28 AA Bde had a total of 70 HAA guns (3.7-inch and 4.5-inch). Farndale, p. 106. On 1 June 1940, along with other AA units equipped with the older 3-inch and newer 3.7-inch AA guns, the 55th was designated a Heavy AA Regiment. 55 (Kent) HAA Regt operated as part of 28 AA Bde guarding the Thames, Chatham and Dover in 6 AA Division.6 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45 =Battle of Britain= The Thames South guns were heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain. On 18 August, for example, German air raids appeared over RAF airfields at West Malling, Manston, Kenley, Biggin Hill, Gravesend and the town of Sevenoaks, all within four and a half hours in the afternoon. The guns of 28 AA Bde and its neighbours were in action and accounted for 23 enemy aircraft. Four days later a mass raid flew up the Thames Estuary to attack RAF Hornchurch on the Essex shore: the raid was broken up by the Thames guns, and then the fighters of No. 11 Group RAF attacked. Follow-up raids were marked for the fighters by 'pointer' rounds of HAA fire. On 1 September over 200 aircraft attacked Maidstone, Biggin Hill, Kenley and Chatham: in joint action with the fighters, the guns broke up the formations and shot down four aircraft, but the airfields at Biggin Hill and Kenley were badly hit. Next day a mass raid arrived over the Medway and flew up the Thames towards Hornchurch. They came under heavy fire from the 3.7s and 4.5s of Thames South and Thames North and 15 were shot down before the fighters took over. On 7 September heavy raids up the estuary attacked oil wharves at Thameshaven, Tilbury Docks and Woolwich Arsenal: a total of 25 aircraft were destroyed by AA guns and fighters. On 15 September, remembered as the zenith of the battle, the guns of 28 AA Bde were in prolonged combat, especially with aircraft over Chatham in the morning, and again in the afternoon.Routledge, pp. 385‚Äì6.Farndale, pp. 109‚Äì10. =The Blitz= 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Fort Amherst, Chatham After 15 September the intensity of Luftwaffe day raids declined rapidly, and it began a prolonged night bombing campaign over London and industrial towns (The Blitz). This meant that 28 Bde's guns were in action night after night as the bomber streams approached the London Inner Artillery Zone, but even with the assistance of searchlights, the effectiveness of HAA fire and fighters was greatly diminished in the darkness. By the start of the Blitz Thames South had a planned layout of 25 HAA sites (of which only 16 were occupied). It ran from Dartford to Chatham, where there was a strongly defended area containing the naval dockyards at Chatham and Sheerness and the aircraft factory at Rochester. The Blitz ended in May 1941.Routledge, pp. 387‚Äì9. =Mid-War= The regiment provided the cadre for a new 418 HAA Bty, which formed on 10 April 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, and joined 55th HAA Rgt on 7 July. It also provided the cadre for 462 HAA Bty formed on 7 August 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt, which joined 133rd (Mixed) HAA Rgt on 10 September. ('Mixed' regiments were those where women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were integrated into the unit.) In June 1941, 308 Bty left the regiment on its way to West Africa Command to join 2nd HAA Rgt, West African Artillery.Frederick, pp. 758‚Äì9, 991.Joslen, p. 490.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941 with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. In the autumn of 1941 the regiment left 28 AA Bde (leaving behind 418 Bty, which joined 59th (Essex Regiment) HAA Rgt) and briefly joined 34th (South Midland) AA Bde covering Birmingham and Coventry in 11th AA Division.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. However it soon left AA Command and became part of the War Office Reserve.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941 with amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. =Middle East= The regiment left the UK in September 1942 and went by sea via Cape Town to Iraq, where in November it joined 'PAIFORCE' (GHQ Persia and Iraq).55 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 Joslen, p. 488. 55 HAA Regiment left Iraq in April 1943 to move to North Africa, where it came under command of Middle East Forces.Joslen, pp. 485. =Sicily= In July 1943 the regiment was assigned to 15th Army Group for the Allied invasion of Sicily.Joslen, p. 466. For the initial landings on 10 July, 55 HAA Rgt's three batteries were allotted to beach groups of XXX Corps arriving during the first morning, but regiments were mixed up and no overall AA HQ was landed, so a great deal of reorganisation was required during the first two days of the operation. The lightweight No 3 Mark III ('Baby Maggie') mobile gunlaying radar sets proved too fragile for landing over an open beach. Also, radio and telephone communications could not be established, and Allied airborne formations overflying the beachheads to their drop zones suffered badly from friendly fire. As Eighth Army advanced up the east coast of the island during July, batteries of 55 HAA Rgt were stationed to defend the port of Augusta, where it reported daily attacks by Messerschmitt Bf 109s and nightly attacks by Junkers Ju 88s operating from 28,000 to 30,000 feet. At Augusta, 55 HAA Rgt came under the command of 73 AA Bde, while 307th Bty back at Syracuse was under 62 AA Bde.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267.Routledge, pp. 259‚Äì63. =Italy= During the invasion of mainland Italy in late 1943, beginning the Italian Campaign, 55 HAA Rgt at first remained in Sicily defending Augusta.Routledge, Table XLIII, p. 268. Later, as the Allied armies advanced, the AA units followed to protect vital airfields and ports in the rear. 55th HAA Regiment crossed to Italy to join 52 AA Bde stationed at the airfield complex around Foggia.Joslen, p. 467.Routledge, p. 291. It later moved to 66 AA Bde supporting the advance of US Fifth Army particularly the Salerno bridgehead and airfields. After the breakout from Anzio in May 1944, 66 AA Bde took over that area, and then followed Fifth Army up the west coast through Rome until it reached Livorno, where 55 HAA Rgt defended the important supply port. During the winter of 1944‚Äì45, 55th HAA Rgt was transferred to 12 AA Bde, supporting British Eighth Army.Routledge, pp. 285‚Äì6 & Table XLIV, p. 293. 3.7-inch HAA gun in action in the field artillery role in Italy. The Luftwaffe 's strength in Italy growing weaker, AA defence became less important and Eighth Army's HAA guns were increasingly used in the medium artillery role to support the ground troops. The effectiveness and accuracy of the 3.7-inch gun and the ample supply of AA ammunition made HAA units a useful addition for the artillery commanders. They were required to find and train their own men for unfamiliar work in Observation Posts (OPs) and Command Posts. Counter- bombardment, defensive fire and harassing fire programmes were carried out, and firing airbursts above entrenchments, and destroying hard targets such as buildings became specialities of the HAA gunners. 55 HAA Regiment spent months of the Italian campaign engaged in this way as corps medium artillery, often working with Air OP spotters.Routledge, pp. 279-81.2 AA Brigade History of the Italian Campaign for the period August 1944‚ÄìApril 1945, TNA file WO 204/7240. As a result, 55 HAA Rgt escaped the disbandment that befell many other AA units as the war drew to a close. By January 1945 it was with 12 AA Bde around Forli. 12 Bde's remaining units were spread thinly to defend a large number of roads, ports and railheads for Eighth Army and landing grounds for the Desert Air Force. Luftwaffe intrusions were rare, but from April were increasingly made by jet aircraft which were difficult AA targets (the necessary advanced radar, predictors, fuse setters etc all being sent to AA units in North West Europe to deal with V-1 flying bombs). The regiment was still serving in Italy when the Surrender of Caserta was signed on 29 April 1945.The History of HQ 12 AA Brigade 1939‚Äì1945, TNA, file WO 204/7254.Routledge, Table XLVIII, pp. 296-7. 55th HAA Rgt with 163, 166 and 307 Btys was officially placed in suspended animation on 15 February 1946, but actually was retained as a cadre on 1 March. Postwar =73 HAA Regiment= The war service personnel of 55 HAA Rgt continued under the old regimental and battery numbers until 1 April 1947 when they were redesignated 73 HAA Regiment in the Regular Army with the batteries reorganised as follows:Federick, p. 957. * 163 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 86 Bty of 72/86 Field Bty, renumbered as 191 HAA Bty * 166 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 91 Bty of 49/91 Field Bty, renumbered as 196 HAA Bty * 306 HAA Bty disbanded to resuscitate 92 Bty of 26/92 Field Bty, renumbered as 197 HAA Bty This regiment and its batteries were reduced to cadre on 20 December 1954 and 191 Bty (and probably the others) was placed in suspended animation on 1 February 1955. All the batteries were officially disbanded on 1 January 1962. =455 (Kent) HAA Regiment= The TA regiment was officially placed in suspended animation on 1 January 1947 and concurrently reformed at home as 455 (Kent) (Mixed) HAA Rgt (Mixed because it included members of the Women's Royal Army Corps). It was at first assigned to 54 (Thames & Medway) AA Bde (the former 28 AA Bde), but that formation was soon disbanded. On 1 August 1950 the regiment was briefly redesignated 455 (Kent) (Mixed) AA Fort Regiment (Thames Estuary), consisting of 'P' Battery and 'Q', 'R' and 'S' AA Forts, but it reverted to its previous title on 24 November the same year.Frederick, p. 1015.444‚Äì473 Regiments at British Army units 1945 on After AA Command disbanded on 1 March 1955, 455 HAA Rgt also began to disband, and this was completed by 1 July 1955.

Fighting broke out around the towns of Marynivka, Dmytrivka, Stepanivka, Shakhtarsk, as well as the strategic hill of Savur-Mohyla. It later spread to the cities of Snizhne and Torez. While the battle was in progress, a civilian passenger airliner, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, was shot down near Hrabove. Amidst a wide counter-offensive by the insurgents and their Russian backers across Donbass, government troops were forced out of Shakhtarsk Raion on 26 August. Events by location From 6 April, as part of the rising unrest in Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) captured towns and cities across Donetsk Oblast, including Shakhtarsk Raion. The raion is in a crucial position between the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and Russia. Ukrainian government forces launched an offensive against insurgent forces in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine on 7 April, resulting in the War in Donbass. War reached Shakhtarsk Raion on 16 July, after insurgents retreated from most of northern Donetsk Oblast. Fighting took place across the raion, in an attempt by the government to cut-off insurgent supply lines, and to reach the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. =Stepanivka= DPR-affiliated insurgents launched an offensive on neighbouring government-controlled Marynivka from village of Stepanivka on 16 July. Ukrainian forces said that they retook Stepanivka from the insurgents on 29 July, and then advanced towards nearby Pervomaisk. According to an 11 August report, the village appeared to have been almost completely destroyed by shelling during the fighting across the raion. Stepanivka returned to insurgent control on 14 August. =Marynivka= Marynivka is a border town located in the southern Donetsk Oblast. Its position on the border made control of it important to maintaining insurgent supply-lines. Insurgents launched an offensive on National Guard of Ukraine positions in the town on 16 July, after breaking through encirclement by government forces in neighbouring Stepanivka. Fighting also spread to the nearby village of Tarany. During this offensive, the insurgents used tanks, mortars, and anti-tank missiles against government forces. Insurgents held Marynivka until the National Guard was able to repel their offensive and force them to retreat to Stepanivka. Later on, the insurgents said that had recaptured Marynivka. Insurgent spokesman Sergei Kavtaradze said that one insurgent had been killed, while fifteen were injured. Insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that DPR insurgents destroyed two Ukrainian armoured vehicles and captured one. Ukrainian forces came under continued attack by the insurgents in Marynivka, despite managing to hold onto control of it on 16 July. On the day after the first insurgent offensive, government forces repelled another four attacks, and destroyed three tanks, two armoured personnel carriers, and two other combat vehicles. Mortar fire from Russia rained down on the Marynivka border crossing on 25 July. Government forces said they shot down at least three Russian unmanned aerial vehicles on the same day. Insurgents said that they left the area on 31 July, after near- constant fighting with government forces. Despite this, Ukrainian positions in and around Marynivka were shelled by Grad rockets and mortars on 1 August. Insurgents launched a new offensive on Marynivka on 14 August. After fierce fighting with government forces in the vicinity of the border crossing, the town was captured by the insurgents. =Dmytrivka= On 3 August, a Ukrainian Su-25 jet was shot down near Dmytrivka, but the pilot safely ejected from his plane. =Savur-Mohyla= The strategic hill Savur-Mohyla, as seen from Snizhne. Insurgents used the hill to shell government positions in Marynivka Savur-Mohyla is a strategically important hill near the Russia-Ukraine border, and overlooks the villages of Dmytrivka and Marynivka. DPR-affiliated insurgents used the hill to shell the government-controlled village of Marynivka on 16 July, amidst an offensive by the insurgents on that village. In response, the Air Force of Ukraine attacked insurgents positions on the hill, whilst the insurgents tried to repel this attack by firing anti-aircraft guns at Air Force aeroplanes. Government forces near that were encircled near the hill tried to break out of encirclement and rout the insurgents on it. Ukrainian fighter jets were shot down near the hill on 23 July. A report by the Ukrainian government said that the shoot-downs were caused by missiles fired from Russia. Insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that DPR fighters shot down one of the planes, and that the pilot ejected. Ukrainian forces said that they retook the hill on 28 July. As a result, a corridor was created to resupply units that were trapped nearby. Intense fighting in the area continued on 31 July. Insurgents attacked Ukrainian positions on the hill from the nearby city of Snizhne on 5 August. A spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said on 6 August that Ukrainian forces on Savur-Mohyla had come into contact with pro-Russian insurgents twenty-five times in the past twenty-four hours. Amidst a wide counter-offensive by insurgents forces across the Donbass on 26 August, Savur-Mohyla was recaptured by DPR-affiliated forces.Donetsk militia claims assuming control of border stretch to Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS, 26 August 2014 =Malaysia Airlines Flight 17= Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down with a Buk surface- to-air missile near Hrabove, about from Shakhtarsk, on 17 July.

Air raid sirens were heard, heavy fighting erupted, and street battles took place across the city. Insurgents attacked government forces from the south, but later retreated. Reinforcements from neighbouring Snizhne arrived to assist the embattled DPR insurgents. Subsequently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that they had captured Shakhtarsk. Two days later, however, the DPR-affiliated insurgents said they had reasserted control over the city, and pushed Ukrainian forces to its outskirts. They also said that a large amount of Ukrainian equipment was destroyed in the fighting. An insurgent ambush killed ten Ukrainian soldiers on 31 July. According to Ukrainian officials, mortars were used to attack the troops as they were re-deploying. Fierce clashes between government and insurgent forces continued in early August. Many civilians left their homes to escape the fighting, and whilst those that remained became emotionally distressed because of constant overnight artillery bombardment. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors visited Shakhtarsk on 8 August. They said that the town was \\"deserted\\", and that no shops were open. According to local residents, water was only available for two hours a day, and electrical power and gas service were non-existent. There was damage from shelling across the town, and multiple residential buildings were seen destroyed. Insurgents fended off continued attempts by government forces in late August to remove them from Shakhtarsk. =Snizhne and Torez= Damaged building in Snizhne, 6 August 2014 Snizhne and Torez are cities that are geographically located in the Shakhtarsk Raion, but which are administered separately. Violence had occurred in Snizhne prior to the battle, including a rocket attack by an aeroplane on 15 July that killed at least eleven people and damaged many homes. Ukrainian forces said they entered Torez and other nearby villages on 28 July. They managed to hold the town only briefly, as DPR-affiliated insurgents forced them to withdraw from the area on 1 August. Clashes on the outskirts of the city continued on 7 August, after Ukrainian soldiers tried to relieve their encircled comrades near the town. According to the DPR, these attacks were repelled. Ukrainian forces advanced toward Torez again on 8 August, in an effort to present insurgent attacks on their positions at Savur-Mohyla. Ukrainian forces launched a new offensive with the aim of recapturing Snizhne, Torez and Shakhtarsk on 12 August. Clashes continued in each city. On the next day, Ukrainian artillery destroyed a convoy of lorries filled with ammunition for the insurgents at Snizhne. According to two members of the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council, this convoy had been escorted by Russian military personnel, of which more than 100 were killed and about 300 wounded. Government forces tried once again to retake Torez from the insurgents on 20 August, but were repelled. Ukrainian forces destroyed eleven Grad rocket systems, three tanks, and five armoured vehicles used by the insurgents in Snizhne on 21 August.

Father Massa (center) with San Lorenzo's idol Rinaldo Martino (left). Massa in the 1940s. Lorenzo Bartolom√© Massa (November 11, 1882 ‚Äì October 31, 1949) was an Argentine Catholic priest, mostly notable for being one of the main founders of Club San Lorenzo de Almagro and scout group Don Bosco's Argentinian Explorers. Early years Lorenzo Bartolom√© Massa was born in Mor√≥n, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and his parents Lorenzo Massa and his mother Margarita Scanavino were born in Turin, Italy. His sisters were √Ångela and Blanca, and were also religious. On February 13, 1898, he was ordained to the priesthood by Joseph Vespignani. In 1900, Massa took his first job as a Salesian of Don Bosco Agricultural School in Uribelarrea until October 1902. Then Massa continued at the College Pius IX as a teacher and assistant in theology. In 1908 he was appointed as manager of the Oratorio San Antonio, in 4050 Mexico Street in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Los Forzosos de Almagro (San Lorenzo) During 1908, Massa met a group of boys from the neighborhood named Los Forzosos del Almagro led by a young man named Federico Monti. This name defines virtue of force in the game of football. Facing the drawbacks of playing in the street, the priest offered to let them play in the Oratory of San Antonio. This event would be the preliminary stage of the founding of Club Atl√©tico San Lorenzo de Almagro. Explorers of Don Bosco's Argentinians On December 14, 1875, the first 10 Salesians came to Argentina. Since then, in every city settled, they created works and activities for youth. The Salesians in Argentina turned the whole society \\"donboscana way to the formation of youth\\", concretized through the Holidays oratories, which were characterized by joy, Christian upbringing instilled slowly through techniques such as the classic \\"Goodnight Salesian \\"and many others, combined with various means of attraction: small works of theater, craft workshops, walks with his classic bands to attract people to the Mass. The work of the Salesians continued to grow in the formation of Oratorios. Between 1908 and 1914, the bands, the brackets and Battalions Gymnasts, recorded brilliant pages. In all this, the need to beat form a stable body. It was then that Father Joseph Vespignani (at the upper point of the Salesians), which had received reports of current that attracted young people to leave the Church, and had even reached Argentinian scoutist version (planned by Robert Baden- Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell) wanted ahead of this emerging and influence. Excited about the idea of giving concrete form to something more stable, and recalling Blossio brackets created by Don Bosco at the beginning of his work, combined with the activities of existing brackets gymnasts, he called Father Lorenzo Massa. From that moment, the theoretical and organizational framework of Dom Bosco's Argentinian Scouts outlined. Besides participating in the creation, was the first Chaplain Battalion No. 1. On Sunday February 28, 1915, the announcement of a hike and camp who performed the Scouts of Argentina came to Argentinian priest Lorenzo Massa. \\"Is it possible to join this noble institution with our charism?\\" Massa asked. He presented his draft form, with the children of this company, a Children Battalion, for walks and excursions, as had Don Bosco. On Sunday March 7, after Mass, the children invited were present to join the Children's Battalion. The name originally adopted Child Battalion was the Defenders of the Fatherland, according to the size of each split into nine companies of 30 children. Father Vespignani undertook personally to obtain the appropriate approval of the Superior Chapter of the Salesians of Don Bosco. Some time later, Father Joseph Vespignani called Father Lorenzo Massa, and said: Let's found Don Bosco's Argentinian Explorers. On August 14, 1915, the solemn inauguration of the new school building \\"Saint Francis of Sales\\" (homage to Don Bosco on the centenary of his birth), located at the corner where the streets Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen and Yapey√∫ was placed. The President was received at the entrance of the school by the principal of the house, Father Lorenzo Massa, who to greet said: \\"Today our house is proud to receive his visit, but we'd be more proud if the President of Argentina agreed to be escorted by our scouts, who today make his first official presentation. \\"Thus, for a few minutes the honor guard of the President's Office were not the traditional Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, but was 40 by the first explorers who wore their new uniforms. Everything became a reality on August 14, 1915 (for this reason, the day designated as Explorer), the celebration of the centenary of the birth of Don Bosco. In founding the work, Father Jose said \\"Scouts will be a selection of festive Oratory, where the most prominent oratorians participate in the privileges and responsibilities inherent in Battalions\\" \\"We do not introduce anything new in the Salesians of Don Bosco; explorers of Don Bosco Oratory will just be like leaven among others. \\"And stressed: \\"You shall preserve lifelong autonomy and self-regulation.\\" Explorers of Don Bosco have emerged in the name of God and country to preserve and advance the moral and religious values of youth, arousing noble sentiments of patriotism, twinned with family affection and respect for authority in a climate expansive joy and healthy companionship. Before the end of year 1, and the battalion had 165 explordores in uniform and perfect discipline, by whom was the first Captain and Chief of the General Command, Mr. Ram√≥n Cort√©s Conde. That same year, Father Joseph Vespignani drafted by the Law of Scouts Honor of Don Bosco, published on March 12, 1930. Death On the morning of October 31, 1949, Massa did not open the door of his room in Buenos Aires. A janitor entered and found Father Massa dead in his bed at sixty-six years old. It is believed that he died of cardiac arrest. On October 31, 2008, his remains were deposited in the mausoleum built in his honor located in the Oratorio San Antonio, in 4050 Mexico Street. Works Massa arrived in Tucum√°n in 1916 where he founded the first Salesian work in the province, through an Arts and Crafts Workshop then called Salesian College General Belgrano. He actively participated in the foundation of other Salesian houses, one of which now bears his name: Lorenzo Massa Technical Institute.

The protest has resulted in class and annual examination boycotts. According to Siddharth Sivakumar the need to cling on to the quota arose from the students' fear of competition.http://www.business-standard.com/article/current- affairs/deserting-the-classroom-for-the-streets-115021401378_1.html While distinguishing the protests of Visva Bharati from Hokkolorob, he emphasised on the betterment of the schools rather than endorsing the demand of retaining the 50% internal quota. In an article published in YouthKiAwaaz.com, he writes, \\"Their hopelessness nonetheless seems reasonable to me, being a product of the same system and realising that the students have reason to believe that the administration has let them down. But the onus lies with the university administration as much as it does with the schools themselves.\\"http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2014/12/visva-bharati-university- internal-quota/ Speaking against the Internal Quota, Amartya Sen had remarked, \\"If our interest lies not in the greater good of the society, if our only concern is limited to the academic opportunism that would benefit our own children, and to this end we employ Quotas, then it is safe to say that there is a fundamental lack in the thought process\\". In the second phase of the protests when classes were forcibly shut down Tinpahar published numerous articles severely criticising, what Arani Chakravarty, a senior teacher of the physics department, called \`Goondagiri' at Visva Bharati. According to an article published in The Times of India, Siddharth Sivakumar refutes the very idea that the entire student community was involved in class boycotting: \\"The large number of students accused of avoiding the protest are actually the silenced majority who oppose the agitation and yet, cannot attend classes fearing the consequences. A 'boycott' has to be a voluntary decision and should not be imposed through fear by bringing in outsiders.

Narrated by Johnny Mathis, it covers the 1951 San Francisco Dons football team and its unique stand against racism. The team, including future NFL players and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Bob St. Clair and Gino Marchetti, declined an invitation to play in the Orange Bowl that would have required them to leave their African-American players Ollie Matson and Burl Toler home. This act was one of the contributing factors that led to the end of organized football at the University of San Francisco. The university's athletic news director, Pete Rozelle, went on to become the commissioner of the NFL, where he reshaped American football. Synopsis In 1951, future Pro Football Hall of Famers Gino Marchetti, Bob St. Clair and Ollie Matson powered the University of San Francisco Dons to a 9‚Äì0 record. As one of the nation‚Äôs top teams, USF seemed assured of their first-ever bowl bid and a payout that would save their cash-strapped program. The Dons were invited to Miami under one condition: They take the field without their two African American stars, Matson and Burl Toler. The Dons refused. By choosing not to play, they set a precedent of racial equality more than a decade before the Civil Rights Movement. The Dons' stand against racism is recognized by contemporary African-American studies scholars Dr. Harry Edwards and Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech writer, Dr. Clarence Benjamin Jones, as evidence of sports acting as an engine for social justice in America. Both men state this case in the film. Production Filming began in late 2013. There were over 40 interviews filmed. Filming locations included in and around the University of San Francisco campus, Kezar Stadium, California Memorial Stadium on the Cal Berkeley campus, Carmel-by-the-sea and the Greater Los Angeles area. The surviving members of the 1951 Dons team who appear on camera include Bob St. Clair, Ralph Thomas, Dick Columbini and Bill Henneberry. Several former NFL stars such as Rosey Grier, Gene Washington, Jamie Williams and Toi Cook are featured as well. In addition, many of Matson and Toler's children and grandchildren appear. This is the only film Johnny Mathis has chosen to narrate. Mathis has personal ties to the story, as he was a close friend of Ollie Matson while a track athlete at San Francisco's Washington High. Mathis later sang at Matson's wedding. Reception '51 Dons premiered on ESPN on Sunday, February 9, 2014, in primetime to a strong critical reaction. It subsequently aired 12 times nationally in the U.S. on ESPN Networks and three times throughout Canada on TSN. To date, the film has been seen by over one million viewers. ESPN senior director, programming & acquisitions, Doug White said, \\"ESPN is proud to have '51 Dons as part of our annual Black History Month programming. The film displays the team's solidarity as they support two of their own, forgoing an opportunity to play in a bowl game and the monetary value of a championship.\\" References External links University of San Francisco News & Communication Category:American sports films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Documentaries about sports Category:San Francisco Dons football Category:2010s sports films ","title":"'51 Dons"},{"id":"43451135","text":"TV Nova was a local television channel in Kumanovo, North Macedonia.

Life Born on 10 November 1832 and baptised at Chipping Barnet, Hertfordshire, on 19 January 1834, he was younger son of Edward May Baines, surgeon, of Hendon and Chipping Barnet, by Fanny, his wife. Educated at private schools, he constructed and manipulated telegraphic apparatus by age 14, helped by his uncle Edward Cowper, and an elder brother, G. L. Baines. Two years later, through the influence of Frederick Hill, an uncle by marriage, and Rowland Hill, he obtained an appointment under the Electric Telegraph Company. He remained with the company, seven years, in charge for the first three years of a small office set up in 1848, within the buildings of the General Post Office. In April 1855, on the nomination of Rowland Hill, Baines was made a clerk in the general correspondence branch of the General Post Office. He was transferred after a few months, on account of his knowledge of railways, to the home mails branch. Telegraph promoter Baines planned the laying of a cable to the Canary Islands, across the South Atlantic to Barbados, and along the chain of West India Islands; and he also proposed a cable to connect England with Australia by way of the Canary Islands, Ascension Island, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope. In a letter to The Times (14 September 1858) he further advocated the connection of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by a line across Canada. His most important scheme, which Baines drew up in 1856, was for the government acquisition of existing telegraph systems. This proposal, with the permission of the Duke of Argyll, then postmaster-general, he forwarded to the Lords of the Treasury. After a long interval, in 1865 Frank Ives Scudamore, a post-office official, was instructed by Lord Stanley, then postmaster-general, to report on the advisability of post-office control of the telegraphic systems. In his report Scudamore acknowledged Baines's responsibility for the first practical suggestion. Control of existing telegraph systems was transferred to the Post Office on 5 February 1870. All the main features of Baines's original plan came into operation. In 1875 Baines was made surveyor-general for telegraph business, and in 1878, with a view to decreasing the danger of invasion and increasing the efficiency of the coastguard service, he proposed the establishment of telegraphic communication around the sea-coast of the British Isles, to be worked by the coastguard under the control and supervision of the Post Office. The proposal, renewed in 1881 and again in 1888, was adopted by the government in 1892. Later life In 1882 Baines was made inspector- general of mails and assistant secretary in the Post Office under Sir Arthur Blackwood. He organised the parcel post service, introduced by Henry Fawcett in 1883, extending the system subsequently to all British colonies and most European countries. Different views and systems of postal administration on the continent made his task difficult. Baines became a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1885 and retired through ill-health on 1 August 1893. He had lived for most of his life in Hampstead, has assisted in the acquisition of Parliament Hill Fields for public use, was a member of the Hampstead select vestry, and in 1890 edited Records of Hampstead. He was also a volunteer, serving both as a non-commissioned and commissioned officer. Baines died on 4 July 1911 at Hampstead, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. Works Baines wrote Forty Years at the Post Office (2 vols. 1895), reminiscences with details of reforms in the Post Office. He also published On the Track of the Mail Coach (1896), and contributed an article on the post-office to James Samuelson's The Civilisation of Our Day (1896). Family Baines married in 1887 Laura, eldest daughter of Walter Baily, M.A., of Hampstead.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background There are existing exascale computer research programs in both China and Europe. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The American Super Computing Leadership Act would amend the Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 with respect to: (1) exascale computing (computing system performance at or near 10 to the 18th power floating point operations per second); and (2) a high-end computing system with performance substantially exceeding that of systems commonly available for advanced scientific and engineering applications. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) coordinate the development of high-end computing systems across DOE; (2) partner with universities, National Laboratories, and industry to ensure the broadest possible application of the technology developed in the program to other challenges in science, engineering, medicine, and industry; and (3) include among the multiple architectures researched, at DOE discretion, any computer technologies that show promise of substantial reductions in power requirements and substantial gains in parallelism of multicore processors, concurrency, memory and storage, bandwidth, and reliability. The bill would repeal authority for establishment of at least one High-End Software Development Center. The bill would direct the Secretary to conduct a coordinated research program to develop exascale computing systems to advance DOE missions. Requires establishment through competitive merit review of two or more DOE National Laboratory-industry-university partnerships to conduct integrated research, development, and engineering of multiple exascale architectures. The bill would require the Secretary to conduct mission-related co-design activities in developing such exascale platforms. Defines \\"co-design\\" as the joint development of application algorithms, models, and codes with computer technology architectures and operating systems to maximize effective use of high-end computing systems. The bill would direct the Secretary to develop any advancements in hardware and software technology required to realize fully the potential of an exascale production system in addressing DOE target applications and solving scientific problems involving predictive modeling and simulation and large-scale data analytics and management. Requires DOE also to explore the use of exascale computing technologies to advance a broad range of science and engineering. The bill would direct the Secretary to submit to Congress an integrated strategy and program management plan. The bill would require the Secretary, before initiating construction or installation of an exascale-class computing facility, to transmit to Congress a separate plan detailing: (1) the proposed facility's cost projections and capabilities to significantly accelerate the development of new energy technologies; (2) technical risks and challenges that must be overcome to achieve successful completion and operation of the facility; and (3) an independent assessment of the scientific and technological advances expected from such a facility relative to those expected from a comparable investment in expanded research and applications at terascale-class and petascale-class computing facilities, including an evaluation of where investments should be made in the system software and algorithms to enable these advances. Procedural history The American Super Computing Leadership Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 25, 2013 by Rep. Randy Hultgren (R, IL-14). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a suspension of the rules on September 8, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Hultgren was inspired by a new 33.89-pentaflop computer, the Tianhe-2, that was announced in China. Hultgren said that \\"it's important not to lose sight that the reality was that it was built by China's National University of Defense Technology.\\" The chair of the Department of Cognitive Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Selmer Bringsford, said that the United States falling behind in this field would be \\"devastating\\" because \\"if we were to lose our capacity to build preeminently smart machines, that would be a very dark situation, because machines can serve as weapons.\\" Another consequence to the United States falling behind could be a brain drain of the best scientists and engineers in the field to other countries that are doing more advanced work. Rick Stevens testified in support of the bill during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Stevens is the Associate Laboratory Director responsible for Computing, Environment, and Life Sciences research at Argonne National Laboratory. He called high-performance computing \\"vital to our national interest\\" arguing that it is \\"needed by all branches of science and engineering\\" and is used \\"by U.S. industry to maintain a competitive edge in the development of new products and services.\\" Aline D. McNaull or the American Institute of Physics reported that members of the United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy \\"demonstrated bi-partisan enthusiasm for advanced computing technology\\" during a May 22, 2013 hearing.

Canuto, written by Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi, and starring Kylan James, Kjord Davis, Diana Grivas, Alexander Aguila, and Alexandra Smothers. The film was screened at over thirty international film festivals, mainly those with a LGBT theme, winning awards including best film. It is considered a cult film in many circles, becoming a classic in underground Gay Cinema after many screenings around the world. Toto Forever is a fable in which feelings and emotions are always fully exposed, with a very poetic and symbolic narrative, and an aesthetic strongly influenced by the Yaoi (\\"Boys Love\\") Japanese anime. The film tells the love story of Toto, a hopeful young postman who dreams of starting a new life, and Mark, a gangster, who is in deep trouble with a mafia group. The film premiered at the 2010 Kashish Mumbai International Film Festival, the first LGBT festival in India organised after a Delhi High Court ruling decriminalised homosexual intercourse between consenting adults. Toto Forever was at the opening ceremony, and was the first film screened at the event. Canuto was also invited to screen the film at the opening ceremonies in Panama at the 3rd LesGayCinePTY, the most important gay film event in the country, where it won the best film award. At the South Asian premiere, at Indonesia's Q! Film Festival in Jakarta, there were serious incidents at some of the screenings when radical Muslim demonstrators from the Islamic Defenders Front, and groups of extremists from the Indonesian University, attended the venue with weapons and threatened to set fire to the theatre if the film was screened. Toto Forever was screened in many other venues around the world, receiving other accolades like the nomination for best cinematography at the 2009 Kodak Scholarship awards in the United States. Plot While delivering a package, a young postman Toto (Kylan James) discovers an injured man lying next to an inground pool and tends to his wounds. Mark (Kjord Davis) is in trouble with the mob and the two men decide to flee together. While resting on the side of the road, Toto gazes longingly at the handsome fugitive. He touches the sleeping man's hand and leans over to kiss him... and is surprised when the kiss is returned. Cast * Kylan James as Toto * Kjord Davis as Mark * Diana Grivas as Nurse * Alexander Aguila as Gangster * Alexandra Smothers as Mysterious Woman Production Scene from Toto Forever with Kylan James and Kjord Davis. Toto Forever's director, Roberto F. Canuto, shot the film as a graduation project at the New York Film Academy (NYFA) at Universal Studios in Hollywood, but he finished the post-production work after graduation, including adding music by Andrea Centazzo. The film was the first collaboration between the director and the composer, one which was repeated in their next films together - Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal. Due to limitations in the production process, various scenes in the script were shortened. Of the film's length, the director commented: \\"Of course, the whole story need to be tell with more depth and time (sic), but we reserve the full development of the plot for the feature script. Here we concentrate on feelings and emotion. For that reason I wanted to develop a plot that displayed a wide range of emotions in a short period of time.\\" Regarding this, the critic Michael D. Klemm notes: \\"A short film can be like a sketch for a painting and this one begins, appropriately, with rough drawings of the two leads. The emphasis here, undoubtedly, is what the young postman would remember from his abrupt adventure. Credit drawings by Susan Opperman The main idea behind the characters is based on cartoon figures from the Japanese yaoi. In the opening and closing credits the film uses sketches that represent the characters of Toto and Mark, bringing an added dimension to the story. Susan Opperman, a South African artist with an MFA in fine arts, created the images, following her own vision of the story. Kjord Davis as Mark in a scene of Toto Forever The film was shot in 16mm Kodak film and the principal photography took place in the summer of 2008 in California. Some of the locations were Mulholland Drive, Burbank, California, as well as some isolated roads outside Los Angeles. The post-production was completed in 2010. Xu Xiaoxi, Roberto F. Canuto's collaborator in the directing (Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal), was director of photography on Toto Forever. The kissing scene between the characters is a key element of the film. According to the Canuto: \\"I wanted to create a montage for the kissing scene. In order to do so, we decided to break standard time and space in order to create a special tempo that surprises the viewer and suspends the reality of the experience. The kissing scene was difficult to film due to the position of movement in such a tight space. This was key to delivering the right feel and emotion. Kylan and Kjord deliver a moving and touching scene that is also the zenith of the whole story.\\" The main theme of Toto Forever is hope. According to the director, he wanted to: \\"recreate the moment when the human spirit recovers after a deep tragedy and rediscovers a new faith about life. Emily Dickinson's poem \\"Hope\\" was an inspiration for this film.Dickinson was troubled from a young age by the \\"deepening menace\\" of death, especially the deaths of those who were close to her While she faced the tragedy, it was with this painful moments when she has to allowed herself to find \\"hope\\" and move on. As of July 2014, Toto Forever was still being screened at international festivals.  Reception  The film was well received at the different film festivals and events where it was screened. Among others it won the award for best film at \\"LesGayCinePTY in Panam√° 2010\\", was third place in the best short film category at the 6u CinegailesAST in Asturias, (Spain) in 2014, and a finalist at the Kashish 1st Mumbai International Film Festival. As of July 2014 the film has been screened at over thirty international film festivals. The press reactions were positive and the comments highlight the values of the film. Some of the reactions include: * \\"Regardless of its brevity, Toto Forever effectively invokes an idyllic mood with an undercurrent of danger. The moments that Toto and Mark get to share are very romantic and sensual...Canuto has a nice eye for the image and effectively exploits the language of close-ups. The lovers' faces fill the screen as they kiss; sometimes the camera lingers only on their lips...Toto Forever is sexy and suspenseful. Despite not being developed into a fully fleshed out movie, Canuto's short contains many pleasures.\\" from Michael D. Klemm at Cinemaqueer.com, 2009 (United States). * \\"...Every detail has significance as they subliminally add substance to an otherwise naive narrative. This collaboration is like a marriage of interpretation between the script and the art of cinema: combining the construct of the director with the skill of the cinematographer... The angle of photography requires of us to re- examine and not view things is a conventional way. Backward glances are shown through rear view mirror techniques and distorted reflections off a champagne bowl question the reason and nature of what might be obvious. Just as the crystal is multifaceted and reflects and refracts, we are encouraged to examine, kaleidoscopically and appreciate how brilliantly colourful this ‚Äògem‚Äô is!\\" from Dickie King at Movies-TOO-Gay, 2011 (South Africa). * \\"... this international hit film promises to become one of the new Gay classic movies and we look forward to seeing the new film by director Roberto Canuto\\". from Cultura Pride, 2011 (Panama).

The painter created her first painting on December 1995 in Moscow. The Thus Spake Zarathustra cycle is a series of twenty-eight oil paintings made by the artist from 1995 to 1997 and thirty graphic works made in 2009. Twenty-four of the paintings depict so- called round-headed little men and their struggles in life. The remaining four depict Zarathustra himself, his eagle and serpent. Six paintings of the series were purchased by the Moscow Museum of Modern Art and by some important private collectors. The oil painting Also Sprach Zarathustra series was exhibited several times ‚Äî including the exhibition at the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1997 and at the First Moscow Biennale of contemporary art in 2005. In 2004, a bilingual edition of Nietzsche's book Also sprach Zarathustra was published in Russian and German by the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The edition includes 20 Hades paintings from this cycle and the art critical essays written by three art historians Alexander Yakimovich, Olga Yushkowa and Jean- Christophe Ammann, professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt and the director of the Museum of Modern Art in 1991-2001. Paintings All paintings of the cycle the artist herself calls visual metaphors to the book and not illustrations. The first half of Hades' cycle begins addressing the Last Man, \\"who makes everything small\\". The last man is sneaky and coward, he takes no risks, but he wants success and comfort. The second half of the cycle is devoted to Zarathustra himself and to his friend ‚Äî the eagle. In Lena Hades interview with Nietzsche.ru portal, she told about the prehistory of the cycle. \\"To be very brief, in my case, there was the birth of painting from the spirit of the text. An artist was born inside me only due to Nietzsche. Without Nietzsche I would never have decided to become a professional artist, to abandon from all other \\"callings\\" in favor of painting. It was a difficult decision, because the artist is easy to die from starvation. Very easy. Prior to Nietzsche I naively believed in many things that I had been imposed on by the surrounding society. I believed, for example, in culture, science, friendship, love, and church. A lot of things were unshakeable for me, and I lived with the ideas about them established without me. But when I first read Zarathustra - this text insulted me in all my best beliefs and convictions. It didn‚Äôt leave even the slightest hint of these my naive notions, it denied everything. Everything turned out not so, as I thought. And since it hurt me so, I began to read it more carefully. And gradually I realized that in general it was right that the world is not what it seems to us, not what our parents and social environment tries to teach us, or in other words, social suggestion of the world does not match the reality of the world. And most importantly - the real world has values completely different from the \\"conventional\\" values of any taken separately culture. All this led to the inner upheaval and change in attitude. I saw the world with different eyes. With Nietzsche‚Äôs eyes! And then his eyes for some reason just became my eyes. Apparently, there is a certain spiritual affinity between us, which allows me now to breathe easy his texts\\". \\"Your works, especially large ones, are dominated by these expressive saturated reds and yellows, creating an atmosphere of condensed semi-insanity, inhuman, demonic tension. Therefore, your paintings crush with their power and heavy energy. Heavy pressing power. You have it anywhere. Is that the feeling you have due to Nietzsche‚Äôs texts?\\" Lena Hades replies \\"For me, this is what the nakedness of life is, or more precisely, its halkion element. And somehow none of the Nietzsche experts have ever paid any attention to this halkion perception of Nietzsche. And yet, in ECCE HOMO Nietzsche calls himself a halkioner. I think that Nietzsche borrowed the word \\"halkioner\\" from Ancient Greek, which he knew brilliantly. In ancient Greek \\"halkeyo\\" means \\"to be a blacksmith, to forge.\\" A halkion element is a kind of a forging element, not just chthonic, underground, but forging, where metal melts and is forged. This is a kind of an inner smithy, where the character is forged, and human will and strength are forged.\\" Painting perception Jean-Christophe Ammann called the painting of the series tablets. \\"Figurative language of Lena Hades expresses itself often intentionally as a poster, because we see here some visual tablets which should stir and awaken. At the same time, the language of her images remains faithful to the fundamental task of the artist: every artist should be a dervish, not only in order to conjure the collective memory, being in constant motion, but also to stay in the thought and memory of our times. Lena Hades is a dervish.\\" Image:Zarathustraundzwerg.jpgZarathustra and dwarf, 1997 Image:Eagleandsnake.jpgEagle and snake, 1997.

The film stars Sivaji Ganesan, K. R. Vijaya, Prabhu and V. K. Ramasamy in lead roles. The film had musical score by Gangai Amaran. The film was a remake of Telugu film Justice Chowdary.  Plot  Rajasekar is a talented prosecutor with a loving wife Radha (K. R. Vijaya), police inspector son Shankar (Natarajan Ramji) and mute daughter Geetha (Menaka). Sattanathan (V. K. Ramasamy) is a defense attorney and a bitter professional rival to Rajasekar. He offers advice and guidance to Kalidas (R. N. Sudarshan), the leader of diamond smuggling gang. Rajasekar earlier successfully argued for Ranjith (R. N. Sudarshan) to be hanged for his crimes. Kalidas has his own ax to grind with Rajasekar as Ranjith was his twin brother. Rajasekar is appointed as a judge bypassing Sattanathan. As judge, he sentences Kalidas' other brother Jagan to life inprisonment. This propels Sattanathan and Kalidas to plan to bring Rajasekar down. Thyagu (Prabhu) is a mechanic and car racer that is determined to build a large house for his imprisoned mother Janaki (Sujatha). Janaki was a single mother that took the blame for a murder Thyagu committed as a child trying to protect her. Thyagu begins to work for Kalidas driving getaway vehicles. He also falls in love with Devi (Raadhika), Sattanathan's daughter. When Devi learns of Thyagu's work, she convinces him to turn a new leaf and give up crime. Just as he's ready to walk away from crime, he learns that his father and the man he believes abandoned Janaki is Rajasekar. Enraged, he teams up with Kalidas and Sattanathan to destroy Rajasekar. They conspire to make Geetha's husband abandon her and have Shankar arrested on false charges. Janaki is released from prison and Rajasekar also learns the truth about those conspiring against him.

As a postdoc, he worked in the research groups of Dieter Oesterhelt (1984 to 1985) and with Kenneth W. Foster at Syracuse University (1985 to 1986). In 1986, he started a research group in the Department of Membrane Biochemistry at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry in Frankfurt, Germany. He became professor at the University of Regensburg and was appointed full professor at the Humboldt-University of Berlin in 2004. In 2015, he was awarded a Senior Research Professor position in Neuroscience by the Hertie Foundation. Research Hegemann, together with Georg Nagel, is credited with the discovery of channelrhodopsins, a family of directly light-gated ion channels. This discovery has opened the new field of optogenetics, manipulating the activity of neurons and other cells with light. Since the original discovery of channelrhodopsin in the green alga Chlamydomonas, Hegemann and his group have improved its properties by molecular engineering, resulting in a wide variety of designer opsins which are faster, more sensitive, responsive to different colors of light, or conduct different ions than natural channelrhodopsins. These molecular tools have enabled neuroscientists around the world to stimulate genetically defined populations of neurons non-invasively and with great precision.

It includes two forts (Forts Greble and Carroll), of which some remains still exist. The parkway runs along the high ground opposite the Anacostia Freeway (Interstate 295) from Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling in the District of Columbia. Shepherd Parkway is bordered on the north by St. Elizabeths Campus and the District of Columbia neighborhoods of Congress Heights and Bellevue and on the south (near Oxon Run) by Bald Eagle Hill.  History  1865 map of the Shepherd Parkway area; Fort Greble is near the southern end and Fort Carroll near the midpoint. The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission began acquiring land in 1927 for a parkway, Fort Drive, to connect a ring of parks made up of Civil War defenses around the city. Shepherd Parkway was the first land acquired; although the parkway was never completed, the land remains urban open space.T.C. Jeffers, \\"A Brief History of the Fort Drive ‚Äî Evolution of its Concept and Function,\\" March 17, 1947. Alexander Robey Shepherd was Washington's second governor. A native Washingtonian and veteran of the Civil War, he was successful in the plumbing and gas-fitting industries. As governor, he paved roads in the city and developed a sewage system. Shepherd Parkway may have been named for Shepherd, who encouraged the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to extend a line through Giesborough south over the Potomac River to Alexandria, Virginia. =Civil War= At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, George Washington Young offered to sell his land to the government for $100,000. Although his offer was declined, the Union army rented the land for $6,000 per year. The following year, Young freed his slaves when the DC Compensated Emancipation Law was enacted. Sixty-eight fortifications were built to defend Washington (the Union Army headquarters) from Confederate attack. Shepherd Parkway was used for fortifications, military roads, the Camp Stoneman cavalry camp (named for Cavalry Bureau chief George Stoneman) and hospitals (Saint Elizabeth and another, near Fort Carroll). Fort Carroll, named for West Point graduate Samuel Sprigg Carroll, was established on the ridge southeast of Giesboro Point. The large fort, a headquarters for soldiers east of the Anacostia River, was built to protect the cavalry depot and the Washington Arsenal and Navy Yard. With a capacity of more than 30,000 horses, Fort Carroll had hospital and administration buildings and barracks. Fort Greble was named for John T. Greble, who was killed in the June 10, 1861 Battle of Big Bethel. The fort, at the southern end of the Shepherd Parkway ridge, protected the Potomac (including the ravines along Oxen Run and Piscataway Road, now Martin Luther King Avenue). Both forts were used for training. Fugitive slaves, considered \\"contraband of war\\" and living in nearby camps, helped build and maintain the forts. After the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery, many remained nearby and by the end of the century the area had a number of African-American communities. = 1866 to 1900 = At the end of the war, the Freedmen's Bureau purchased the Barry farm north of St. Elizabeths Hospital and divided the land into lots. The area remained farmland, and the lots were sold to former slaves; within two years, 500 families owned property. The government decommissioned the cavalry camp, returning the Giesborough land to George Washington Young. Young could not sell his buildings and property, and after his 1867 death his heirs gradually sold the property. A river resort, Buena Vista, was established at Giesborough Point and Fort Carroll was transferred to the Signal Corps. Fort Greble was demolished and its building materials sold at auction. The city's population had doubled during the war, and its infrastructure was strained. In 1871 Pierre L'Enfant's plan was still in its infancy, and many politicians wanted to move the nation's capital west. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 repealed the individual charters of Georgetown and the city of Washington, combining them with Washington County in a new charter‚Äîthe first step towards district government. = Early 20th century = Senator James McMillan of Michigan saw a need for improvements in the city, and the McMillan Plan was created to develop a system of parks in the district (including a parkway connecting the forts). On April 11, 1927, the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission acquired Shepherd Parkway as its first property for its proposed Fort Drive. The plan became a casualty of the Great Depression until 1933, when the New Deal turned most public green space to the National Park Service. The parkway was never constructed, and the land was used for anti-aircraft artillery and military barracks. Present day Today, Shepherd Parkway is of mature trees along the ridge. It has no marked or maintained trails, picnic areas or playgrounds. Until recently the parkway was neglected, with trash and invasive species, but community organizations are attempting to clean and restore it. Shepherd Parkway and Forts Carroll and Greble are administered by National Capital Parks-East.

He joined Darlington from non- league club Wallsend, and went on to play non-league football for Annfield Plain. Life and career Grieve was born in 1906 in Walkergate, Northumberland. He played football for North-Eastern League club Wallsend before joining Darlington of the Football League Third Division North in 1931. He played for Darlington's reserve team in the North-Eastern League before making his Football League debut on 24 October 1931 away to Carlisle United, standing in for the injured Maurice Wellock. Darlington won 2‚Äì0, Grieve scored both goals, and he caught the eye of the Lancashire Evening Post by his \\"pushfulness and sense of leadership\\". Wellock resumed his place after two matches out, but when Grieve was brought in for an FA Cup tie against Carlisle in December, this time alongside Wellock, who moved to inside right to accommodate Grieve at centre forward, he scored again, and scored another in the next league match. In the second half of the season Grieve took over as first choice at centre forward, and contributed a further ten goals from 20 matches, including a hat-trick in a 6‚Äì3 win against local rivals Hartlepools United in which \\"Wellock, Grieve, and Coates shot at every conceivable opportunity, on the half turn, the volley, the half-volley, and on occasions when their backs were turned to the goal\\". Darlington finished 11th in the table. He accepted terms for a second season, but an attempt to convert him to outside left was unsuccessful: he played little and without scoring, and was given a free transfer. He then returned to North-Eastern League football with Annfield Plain, where he flourished. In November 1934, he turned down an offer from the FA Cup-holders, Manchester City, preferring to keep his job in Newcastle with the London and North Eastern Railway, and he stayed with Annfield Plain until at least 1937. The 1939 Register shows Grieve working as a general cartman and living in Raby Street, Newcastle, with his wife Edna and five young children. He died in Newcastle in 1946 at the age of 40.

In a nonpartisan blanket primary, incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston won re-election to a fourth term, avoiding a runoff by receiving 54% of the vote. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke placed second, as the leading Republican challenger. The involvement of Duke introduced unusual party dynamics to the race. Weeks before the election, several nationally prominent Republicans endorsed Johnston, and trailing Republican challenger Ben Bagert dropped out, saying that he would \\"reluctantly\\" vote for the leading Democratic candidate, hoping to avoid a run-off with Duke as the sole Republican. Candidates  =Democratic = * J. Bennett Johnston, incumbent U.S. Senator * Nick Joseph Accardo * Larry Crowe =Republican = Declared  * David Duke, State Representative and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan Withdrew  * Ben Bagert, State Senator Campaign  This election was viewed at the onset as potentially competitive, as incumbent U.S. Senator Johnston was viewed as vulnerable in light of Louisiana's economic troubles at the time and Johnston's voting record viewed by Republicans as too liberal. The Republican Party leadership endorsed the candidacy of State Senator Ben Bagert, who was picked over Secretary of State W. Fox McKeithen, State Representative Quentin Dastugue and State Representative David Duke. David Duke, however, continued his candidacy and slowly overtook Bagert in attention and in the polls. Duke attracted national attention to the race due to his involvement with white supremacist groups and his appeals to white resentment over affirmative-action programs. With Bagert failing to gain traction, the National Republican Senatorial Committee tried to recruit former Governor David Treen to enter the race. When Treen passed, the effort turned from supporting Bagert to stopping Duke. As the election drew near, polls showed Johnston firmly in first place, with Duke in second place and Bagert trailing far behind at third. National Republicans grew fearful that Bagert's candidacy would only serve to force a runoff and that a potential runoff election with Duke being the de facto Republican nominee would hurt the national brand. On October 4, eight Republican U.S. Senators instead endorsed Johnston, with U.S. Senator John Danforth saying at the press conference that \\"all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a Republican.\\" Bagert dropped out of the race the next day, announcing that \\"it became more and more apparent, that instead of forcing a runoff between myself and Bennett Johnston, I might very well be forcing a runoff between somebody else and Bennett Johnston.\\" He announced he would \\"reluctantly\\" vote for Johnston. Bagert's name remained on the ballot, but under state law his votes could not be counted as part of the official tally. After Bagert dropped out, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp endorsed Johnston, saying \\"there's no place in the Republican Party for someone who has practiced and practices racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism.\\" =Endorsements = Results   See also  * United States Senate elections, 1990 and 1991  References  Louisiana 1990 Category:1990 Louisiana elections ","title":"1990 United States Senate election in Louisiana"},{"id":"43451613","text":"Maladrie is a hamlet about south-southwest of Thuin in the Belgium province of Hainaut, in the Wallon region.

It contains all nine of the original Led Zeppelin studio albums remastered from the original analog tapes. Along with the remastered albums, there is a companion disc with each album, consisting of previously unreleased audio tracks and alternate mixes of released tracks. Many of these are described as work-in-progress or alternate mixes made during the original production rather than new remixes generated to highlight discarded recording elements (as did the remixes made for The Beatles Anthology). The first companion album consists of the 10 October 1969 concert in Paris. The albums were released in chronological order, each with inverted album covers. The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, was released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, was released on 27 October 2014. Physical Graffiti was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The fourth and final wave of albums, Presence, In Through the Out Door, and Coda, was released on 31 July 2015.

He was born in St Pancras, London, the son of Henry Latham, a Chancery registrar, and died at Folkestone, Kent. As a cricketer, Latham was a middle-order right-handed batsman. After non-first-class trials matches in 1872, he played fairly regularly in first- team matches for Cambridge University in 1873, and he was picked for the University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 0 and 48 in a match that Cambridge lost narrowly. The 48 was Latham's highest score in first-class cricket. In 1874 he played for MCC against Cambridge University in the university's match immediately before the University Match, and then was picked for his second game against Oxford; this time, he was less successful with innings of 1 and 4, and Cambridge lost the game by an innings. It was Latham's last appearance in first-class cricket, though he appeared in minor matches for amateur teams to the mid 1880s. Career outside cricket Educated at Highgate School, Winchester College and St John's College, Cambridge, Latham graduated in 1874 and was called to the bar as a barrister in the same year. He practised on the Western circuit; then from 1881 to 1888 he was special pleader at the courts in Shanghai, after which he retired to Folkestone where he died in 1926. His son was the cricketer and colonial administrator Geoffrey Latham, while his grandson was the artist John Latham.

The Bloody Letter () is a letter written by Bulgarian revolutionary Todor Kableshkov which is symbolically accepted to be the start of the anti-Ottoman April Uprising of 1876. Kableshkov writes this letter upon proclaiming the revolt in his home city of Koprivshtitsa and addresses it to the revolutionary committee of Panagyurishte and specifically to Georgi Benkovski. The letter's name comes from the fact that it is signed with the blood of a local Ottoman governor (m√ºd√ºr), shortly after he was killed by revolutionary Georgi Tihanek. It was transported by 19-year-old Georgi Salchev for a record time of 2 hours, having his horse passing out just before reaching Panagyurishte because of the strain. According to Memoirs of the Bulgarian Uprisings by Zahari Stoyanov, the letter's contents were: > Brothers! Yesterday Neceb Aga arrived in our village from Plovdiv, and asked > to imprison some people, including me. When I heard about your decision, > made at the Council of Oborishte, I called up some brave men and after we > got armed, we headed towards the konak and attacked it, killing the m√ºd√ºr > and some policemen... Now, as I am writing this letter, the flag is waving > before the konak, rifles shoot and the church bells echo simultaneously with > them, men are kissing one another on the streets...

Background This album was released by Quality Records in Canada to capitalize on the success of Baldry's Out! The material was recorded in the mid -70s, and producer Billy Russell replaced Tom Brown's vocals with Baldry's vocals.(Saxophonist Tom Brown wrote the title track \\"Boys in the Band\\" and the lead track \\"Crazy Lady\\") More than likely, Baldry agreed to this in an attempt to secure a record deal. The material is album-oriented rock highlighted by the title song and the work of Baldry's guitarist Alan Murphy, who later worked with Kate Bush. Not available on CD. Although the album was not released until early 1980 two tracks had appeared on a single from ABC records (ABC 4016) in November 1974. LJB released the single under the name ‚Äì John Baldry Barracuda. The single features \\"Crazy Lady\\" as its A-side and \\"End of Another Day\\" as the B-side. Boys in the Band is one of the more obscure Baldry releases that is very rarely seen in discographies. It was made available for digital download in 2010 by Minder Records. The album was not promoted with a tour and none of the material has ever appeared on live recordings. In 1974 however LJB did record the track ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs See What Love Can Do‚Äù in a club during a concert that was filmed as part of the documentary ‚Äì The Gospel According to Long John. This is the only known time anything from Boys in the Band was played live. This may have been due to the fact ABC were set to release the album or more singles and LJB was slowly introducing the material into his repertoire. During a British tour in 1974 many of the tracks were performed along with Baldry's repertoire of classic blues.

Career  Slapin has written more than sixty viola- centric chamber works and was commissioned to write the required piece for the 2008 Primrose International Viola Competition. He served on the committee for the first Maurice Gardner Composition Competition and co-premiered the winning work, Rachel Matthews' Dreams, at the 38th International Viola Congress. At the age of eighteen he was performing daily as the solo violist in the New York City production of Gerald Busby's Orpheus In Love, a chamber opera about Orpheus recast as a viola player. He was subsequently invited to premiere Busby's Muse for Solo Viola in Carnegie's Weill Hall, and he gave countless solo recitals and performed with ensembles throughout the United States and South America. Slapin has written extensively for the Penn State Viola Ensemble and the Wistaria String Quartet, and he is a former fellow at the Montalvo Arts Center in California.He can be heard playing solo Bach, Paganini Caprices, and his own compositions on various soundtracks for film and TV. Slapin performs and records with his wife, Tanya Solomon, also a violist. They won 'Best Chamber Performance of 2008' at the Tribute to the Classical Arts in New Orleans, and they have premiered and recorded duos by Gerald Busby, Robert Cobert, Richard Lane, Rachel Matthews, Patrick Neher, Frank Proto and David Rimelis, among others. Slapin plays a viola built by Hiroshi Iizuka.  Recordings  To date, there have been nine recordings of Slapin's chamber music made by the Wistaria String Quartet, the Penn State Viola Ensemble, the American Viola Quartet, and the Slapin-Solomon Viola Duo. Slapin was the first person to record the complete cycle of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas (originally for violin) on viola, a set which he rerecorded in 2006. He has premiered and recorded many 20th and 21st Century recital works featuring the viola, and he is the featured soloist on the first album produced by the American Viola Society. His 2008 recording, Paganini's 24 Caprices, marked the first time Paganini's 24 Caprices had been recorded on the viola since Emanuel Vardi in 1965. After more than a decade of performing together as members of several orchestras, Slapin and Solomon transcribed for viola duo some of the symphonic repertoire's best-known works and in 2017 made an unprecedented two-viola recording of four of them: Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Rossini's Overture to the Barber of Seville, as well as an unabridged version of all four movements of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Education Slapin graduated at the age of eighteen from the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Emanuel Vardi. In memory of Vardi, he wrote 'Capricious', a viola trio which references several of Paganini's Caprices. Slapin's Nocturne is dedicated to his composition teacher and mentor Richard Lane, and can be heard, along with Slapin's Elegy-Caprice, in the final scenes of the American docudrama Secret Life, Secret Death References External links * *Slapin-Solomon Viola Duo *Tanya Solomon's Website Category:American classical violists Category:Living people Category:1974 births ","title":"Scott Slapin"},{"id":"43451773","text":"Talib Pasha bin Rajab Al-Naqib Al-Refa'i () was an Iraqi politician, who became the first Minister of Interior in Iraq  Family  Rajab al-Naqib. He is Talib bin Rajab bin Muhammad Sa'eed bin Talib Al-Naqib Al-Refa'i. He descends from the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, Imam Husayn. al-Naqib family descends from the city of Mandali, where Talib (the great grandfather) emigrated with his two sons, Muhammad Sa'eed and Abdul Rahman, to Basra between 1811‚Äì1814. Other sources say that they lived in Mecca, but the Abbasid Caliph, Al-Qa'im Bi-Amrillah, brought them to be the Sheikhs of Nobles of Basra. After the death of Talib, the Naqib of Nobles (Sheikh of Nobles) of Basra, the sheikdom became in the hands of his son, Abdul Rahman in 1874 and then, Muhammad Sa'eed, who became the vice-chairman of the properties of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. When Muhammad Sa'eed got old, he qualified his son, Rajab to be the vice-chairman of the sultan's properties. After the death of Muhammad Sa'eed in 1896, Rajab became the Sheikh of Nobles. Because of his courageousness, bravery, and boldness, Rajab was feared by anyone who won't obey his orders, including the Valis of Basra. People called him Robin Hood. Most of the al-Naqib family descended to Kuwait, in around 1900, and became one of the most famous families in Kuwait. Former Prime Minister of Kuwait, Nasser Al-Sabah, is from the family of al-Naqib, as he is the grandson of Talib al-Naqib from his daughter, Nasima.  Early life  In 1899, Rajab sent his son, Talib, to Istanbul, to solve the problems between the first ruler of Kuwait, Mubarak Al-Sabah and the Vali of Basra, Hamdi Pasha, about the 1899 treaty between the United Kingdom and Kuwait, and he succeeded. After that, Hamdi Pasha was deposed, replacing him with Muhsin Pasha. Talib also solved the problem between the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Khaz'al al-Ka'bi and the Ottoman Empire, about Khaz'al's properties in Basra. He donated some of his money to the Ottomans during their conflicts with the Principality of Bulgaria, and for that, he was given the special rank of Mermaran, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in 1895.  Governor of Al-Hasa  In 1901, al-Naqib was set as the governor of al-Hasa in Najd, after the tribe of Banu Hajar attacked a governmental caravan and stole a value of a million rupees from it; because the leaders of the tribe requested their salary, but the government didn't reply to them. al- Naqib ordered to raid a military camp of Al Murrah, who were responsible for the caravan attack, and took away their money and animals and put it on sale in Al Hufuf and finally, he ordered the other tribes to cut their deals with them, so the other tribes could take them as an example. He accomplished his mission of suppressing the tribal movements and restore peace and was given the special rank of Bala. In 1903, Mansour bin Jum'a al-Kawakibi, a merchant from Al-Qatif, sent a letter to Sultan Abdul Hamid II, telling him about what happened between him and al-Naqib: After a few days, al-Naqib was sacked from his job.  Ottoman politician  In 1903, al-Naqib returned to Istanbul to work in the civil department of the state consultative council until restoring the constitutional monarchy. He was elected in the first term, in the 1908 Ottoman general election, as a representative of Basra in the Ottoman Parliament, before re-electing him in the 1912 elections and the 1914 elections. In 1909, he created the Free And Neutral Party. He, with the cooperation of Khaz'al al-Ka'bi and Mubarak Al-Sabah, also created a branch of the Freedom and Coalition Party in Basra, on August 6, 1911. The Constitution newspaper was the speaker of the party, which published its first issue on January 9, 1912.Al-Faidhi. p. 96 In the 1912 elections, the Freedom and Coalition party won two seats in the parliament. Because of the decentralized governance in the Ottoman Empire, after they clashed with the Arab political and cultural assemblies, al-Naqib canceled his party's branch in Basra,Al- Faidhi. p. 98 Because of his Arab nationalism beliefs. Ottomans tried to assassinate him via Fareed Bey and Nouri Bey, but al-Naqib prepared a number of armed insurgents that killed them first. He created the Reformist Assembly of Basra, which called for creating local councils for the Arab Vilayets, including the Basra Vilayet. Ottomans wanted to keep him away from politics, so, he was made the Vali of Basra in 1913, for a very short period. In the 1914 elections, al-Naqib increased his party's seats in the parliament by four, having 6 seats, which made him more confident to demand the rights of the Arabs.Al-Faidhi. p. 190  British mandate  Khaz'al al-Ka'bi (middle), Hugh Bell (right), and al-Naqib (left), in 1920. When the British troops arrived at Basra, in 1914, al-Naqib was captured and exiled to Bombay (Mumbai); because of his objection on the British occupation. He stayed in his exile for five years, before coming back to Iraq and witnessing the 1920 Iraqi revolt. He didn't approve of the revolt; because he believed that political situations should be solved by peaceful solutions. He also believed that the best solution is to occupy Iraq into Vilayets, just like the Ottomans did. He was hoping to rule Basra or to rule Iraq. Therefore, he was against Faisal I, being the King of Iraq, with Khaz'al al-Ka'bi and Arnold Wilson supporting al- Naqib. But his fame decreased when Percy Cox became the British high commissioner of Iraq. al-Naqib was appointed as the minister of interior in Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani's acting government, but al-Naqib refused the office; because he thought that such secondary office would degrade his dignity, but he was convinced by Gertrude Bell and St John Philby as long as he would be the second man, after Al-Gillani. When al-Naqib wasn't invited to the Cairo Conference, in 1921, he objected and threatened to make a rebellion, cooperating with the tribal leaders. So, he made a campaign tour in southern Iraq and the middle Euphrates region.Ireland; Al-Khayyat. p. 180 He made a banquet, celebrating Perceval Landon with some tribal leaders. He stood in the banquet and said: \\"We don't like the people in the house of the mandate, because they are interfering in the nation's matters, which its people have the only right to order and own anything they want in it.\\" This statement was copied from a person who attended the banquet, called Tod, to the secretary of the British accreditation house in Iraq, Gertrude Bell. She told Sir Cox about it, which led Miss Bell to invite al-Naqib for tea, on 16 April 1921, with her and Sir Cox's wife, where she arrested him and exiled him to Ceylon. St John Philby was set as the new minister of interior. After returning from exile, al-Naqib decided to retire from political work and avoid meeting any governmental person.Al-Omari. p. 40 He refused to meet King Faisal when he wanted to visit him, but after some interference, they met in 1925, and cleared the problems between them.  Death  Al-Naqib had his health issues, so, he traveled to Munich to have a surgery, but he died through it, on July 16, 1929. His body was sent to Basra, where he was buried in al-Hassan al- Basri cemetery in Al-Zubair.

Under the 2017‚Äì2020 Code of Points (artistic gymnastics), the vault has a D-score of 6.4, and is considered one of the hardest vaults ever performed in women's artistic gymnastics. It currently ties for the highest D-score on this apparatus with the Biles vault. It is named after Yelena Produnova of Russia, who was the first person to complete it successfully in 1999. This vault is also called the \\"vault of death\\" due to its high level difficulty and likelihood of injury. The D-score of the Produnova has been slowly reduced over the quads from 7.1 (2009‚Äì2012) to 7.0 (2013‚Äì2016) and now 6.4 (2017‚Äì2020).  Gymnasts who have successfully completed the Produnova  * (1999) * (2011) (2015) * (2014)  Gymnasts who have attempted the Produnova  * Choe Jong Sil (PRK): 1980 Olympics, landed on her back * Yekaterina Tsvetkova (RUS): 2012 Voronin Cup, landed on her back  Controversy  Controversy was sparked after a video shared of Fadwa Mahmoud's first competitive Produnova attempt where she nearly landed on her neck. As long as the gymnast lands on her feet first, she will get credit for the vault, and because of the massive difficulty value the Produnova possesses, it is easy to get a relatively high score even with poor execution. There have been calls for the Produnova vault to be banned due to the high level of risk. In the Code of Points that came into effect in 2017, the vault has been reduced in value to a D-score of 6.4, with poor landings of it specifically penalised in section 10.4 of the Code. If a gymnast attempts the vault but lands on her feet and any other body part simultaneously, the second somersault will then be regarded as incomplete; thus, the vault will only be credited as a front handspring onto the vault and into only a single front somersault off it.

It is formed by separating a medium of high refractive index (usually silicon) from a metal surface (usually gold or silver) by a small gap. Cross section of hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Power propagates in the z direction.  History  Dielectric waveguides use total internal reflection to confine light in a high index region. They can guide light over a long distance with very low loss, but their light confinement ability is limited by diffraction. Plasmonic waveguides, on the other hand, use surface plasmon to confine light near a metal surface. The light confinement ability of plasmonic waveguides is not limited by diffraction, and, as a result, they can confine light to very small volumes. However, these guides suffer significant propagation loss because of the presence of metal as part of the guiding structure. The aim of designing the hybrid plasmonic waveguide was to combine these two different wave guiding schemes and achieve high light confinement without suffering large loss. Many different variations of this structure have been proposed. Many other types of hybrid plasmonic waveguides have been proposed since then to improve light confinement ability or to reduce fabrication complexity. Guided power density in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Light propagates in the z-direction  Principle of operation  The operation of the hybrid plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of mode coupling. The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a silicon nanowire placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports dielectric waveguide mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the dielectric waveguide mode supported by the silicon nanowire couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As a result of this mode coupling, light becomes highly confined in the region between the metal and the high index region (silicon nanowire).  Applications  Hybrid plasmonic waveguide provides large confinement of light at a lower loss compared to many previously reported plasmonic waveguides. It is also compatible with silicon photonics technology, and can be integrated with silicon waveguides on the same chip. Similar to a slot-waveguide, it can also confine light in the low index medium. Combination of these attractive features has stimulated worldwide research activity on the application of this new guiding scheme. Some notable examples of such applications are compact lasers, electro optic modulators, biosensors, polarization control devices, and thermo-optic switches.

The equation is named after Charles Steinmetz, a German-American electrical engineer, who proposed a similar equation without the frequency dependency in 1890. The equation is: :P_v = k \\\\cdot f^a \\\\cdot B^b where P_v is the time average power loss per unit volume in mW per cubic centimeter, f is frequency in kilohertz, and B is the peak magnetic flux density; k, a, and b, called the Steinmetz coefficients, are material parameters generally found empirically from the material's B-H hysteresis curve by curve fitting. In typical magnetic materials, the Steinmetz coefficients all vary with temperature. The energy loss, called core loss, is due mainly to two effects: magnetic hysteresis and, in conductive materials eddy currents, which consume energy from the source of the magnetic field, dissipating it as waste heat in the magnetic material. The equation is used mainly to calculate core losses in ferromagnetic magnetic cores used in electric motors, generators, transformers and inductors excited by sinusoidal current. Core losses are an economically important source of inefficiency in alternating current (AC) electric power grids and appliances. If only hysteresis is taken into account (√† la Steinmetz), the coefficient a will be close to 1 and b will be 2 for nearly all modern magnetic materials. However, due to other nonlinearities, a is usually between 1 and 2, and b is between 2 and 3. The equation is a simplified form that only applies when the magnetic field B has a sinusoidal waveform and does not take into account factors such as DC offset. However, because most electronics expose materials to non-sinusoidal flux waveforms, various improvements to the equation have been made. An improved generalized Steinmetz equation, often referred to as iGSE, can be expressed as :P = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_0^T k_i {\\\\left\\\\frac{dB}{dt}\\\\right}^a (\\\\Delta B^{b-a}) dt where \\\\Delta B is the flux density from peak to peak and k_i is defined by :k_i = \\\\frac{k}{{(2 \\\\pi)}^{a-1} \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} {\\\\left cos \\\\theta \\\\right}^a 2^{b-a} d \\\\theta} where a, b and k are the same parameters used in the original equation. This equation can calculate losses with any flux waveform using only the parameters needed for the original equation, but it ignores the fact that the parameters, and therefore the losses, can vary under DC bias conditions. DC bias cannot be neglected without severely affecting results, but there is still not a practical physically-based model that takes both dynamic and nonlinear effects into account. However, this equation is still widely used because most other models require parameters that are not usually given by manufacturers and that engineers are not likely to take the time and resources to measure. The Steinmetz coefficients for magnetic materials may be available from the manufacturers. However, manufacturers of magnetic materials intended for high-power applications usually provide graphs that plot specific core loss (watts per volume or watts per weight) at a given temperature against peak flux density B_{pk}, with frequency as a parameter. Families of curves for different temperatures may also be given. These graphs apply to the case where the flux density excursion is ¬±B_{pk}. In cases where the magnetizing field has a DC offset or is unidirectional (i.e. ranges between zero and a peak value), core losses can be much lower but are rarely covered by published data.

She is known for her watercolors of the prairie country around Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which capture the unique qualities of space and light. Life Reta Madeline Summers was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on 1 April 1910. She grew up near Truax and in Yorkton. She attended the Saskatoon Normal School and graduated with a teacher's certificate in 1930. During the Great Depression she taught in rural schools in Saskatchewan. From 1938 to 1946 she held a permanent teaching position in Yorkton. In 1937 Reta attended the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops of the University of Saskatchewan. They had been founded in 1936 by Augustus Kenderdine. She returned to the Emma Lake school in 1938, 1939 and 1940. Gordon Snelgrove taught her art history, and Kenderdine taught her to paint in the Barbizon school's tradition of painting nature directly, en plein air. Reta studied at the Banff School of Fine Arts in the summers of 1941‚Äì44, where Walter J. Phillips taught her watercolor techniques. Reta married Fred Cowley in 1945, adopting his surname. She no longer had to teach, and moved with him to Saskatoon. There she took night classes at the University of Saskatchewan under Eli Bornstein and Nicolas Bjelajac. In the early 1950s Reta Cowley taught at the Emma Lake Summer School. She was a participant in the workshop of 1963. In 1966 she was awarded a BA from the University of Saskatchewan. She taught sessions at the university until 1972, and taught public school until 1975, when she retired and devoted herself to painting. Reta Cowley died on 23 November 2004 at the age of 94. Work Bornstein taught Reta Cowley to use form and color to structure her paintings and to pattern her brush strokes. She became more aware of modern artists such as C√©zanne and John Marin. Cowley's watercolor style had matured by the late 1960s, one in which she depicted the landscapes of the prairies in terms of their unique qualities of light and space. Unlike other watercolorists, Cowley's work shows no signs of an initial pencil drawing. The delicate washes of color are applied without need for such a framework. Her style combines elements of British naturalism and American modernism. It has been compared to the styles of Walter J. Phillips and David Milne. Clement Greenberg wrote, \\"Among the outspokenly representational painters of merit in Saskatoon was Reta Cowley, who renders the villages and towns of central Saskatchewan with delicacy and fresh feeling, She demonstrates that one can learn from C√©zanne and Klee how to make nature more, not less, vivid in pictorial art.\\" In 1949 Reta Cowley wrote for an art school scrapbook, \\"Let us carry back with us into everyday life some of the strength and serenity of the woods. Here we are close to nature. Its cycle of growth and decay and new life can teach us a healthy attitude to the eternal change which is in and above us. Memories of the peace and beauty of our northland can fill a corner of our mind to which we can withdraw for renewed courage when times are difficult.\\" =Selected Solo Exhibitions= Cowley's solo exhibitions included: *1955 Saskatoon Art Centre, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. *1969 Mendel Art Gallery, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

The park is easily accessible from the Stuart Highway, about south of Katherine, and features two show caves where guided tours are offered to the public, making it a popular tourist attraction. The caves are the only tropical examples in Australia which are open to the public. Cutta Cutta Caves are associated with Barrac Barrac, or Diver Duck dreaming creation stories by the local Jawoyn Indigenous people. Other sources, such as Lonely Planet, claim Cutta Cutta is a Jawoyn word meaning \\"many stars\\", as they believe that caves are where the stars rest during the day; however, there does not seem to be a specific name for the formations in the documented or oral history. Evidence of occupation by the Jawoyn people can be found throughout the park with a number of campsites and stone artifacts identified. At least one unnamed cave within the park shows evidence of man-made grooves on an interior wall some distance from the entrance, although it is widely understood that the Jawoyn people did not regularly enter the deep caves. Following European settlement, the main cave was discovered by a stockman around 1900, and has been known by several names. Initially Smith's Cave, during World War II, servicemen called it 16 Mile Cave. In 1967 the caves were placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board as the Sixteen Mile Caves Reserve, and guided tours commenced. In 1979, the park changed to its current name and in 1991, a second cave, Tindal Cave, was opened to the public, which has since been closed. Only one cave is open for guided tours. Cutta Cutta Cave extends , with accessible to the public with lighting and walkways. There are a number of other cave systems within the park which are not open to the public. In addition to a visitor centre and kiosk, the park offers a Tropical Woodland walk, with information for visitors about the local flora and fauna. The caves are subject to flooding during the tropical wet season and may be closed for periods of time. As well as limestone stalactite and stalagmite formations, a number of rare species can be observed in and around the caves including the carnivorous ghost bat and the brown tree snake.
