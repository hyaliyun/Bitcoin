It is named after Nobel Prize-winning British chemist Derek Barton. Barton and his assistants prepared a series of guanidines with steric hindrance in 1982; in this case five alkyl groups: four methyl groups and one tert-butyl group. These bases were some of the strongest known at the time. In 50% water/ethanol, the acidity constant (pKa) of Barton's base is 14. In acetonitrile its pKa is 24.31.  Synthesis  The base is prepared by the reaction of tert-butylamine with a Vilsmeier salt. The latter is the reaction product of phosgene with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylurea.  Applications  Barton's base can be used in many organic reactions, including in alkylations and in the formation of aziridines.

He attended Brown University, received a B.A. from Columbia University and an M.A. from the University of Iowa. He studied in Paris on the G.I.

He also taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Williams College, and Columbia University. From 1949 to 1969 he was married to the art historian and writer Martica Sawin. His work is held in numerous private collections. It was included in the 1955 Annual Exhibit of Contemporary Painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art and in “New York School – Second Generation” at the Jewish Museum in 1957.

Early life Eccles was the son of Richard Eccles, of The Elms, Lower Darwen, Lancashire, but his father died when he was only two.

In 1900 he was appointed as a science master at Gresham's School, a small country school of which George Howson had just become head master, with instructions for a great expansion. In January 1903 he was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, the Norfolk Regiment, in connection with the school's cadet corps,The London Gazette, Issue 27518 dated 23 January 1903, p. 471: “James Ronald Eccles, Gent., to be Lieutenant.\\" and in September of that year the school's new buildings on the Cromer Road were opened. In 1907, Eccles became Second Master and he succeeded as headmaster on Howson's death in 1919. He continued to head the school until 1935. In a biography of his pupil James Klugmann, Eccles is described as \\"a progressive headmaster, a critic of the competitive public school system who wanted to instil a sense of trust, loyalty, and a civic public service ethic among his pupils.Geoff Andrews, The Shadow Man: At the Heart of the Cambridge Spy Circle, chapter 2, “Outsider at Gresham’s” The American Charles K.

Taylor, \\"Where boys and masters pull together: the sixth and final article on the schools of England”, in The Outlook, vol. 145 (Outlook Publishing Company, 1927) However, W. H. Auden was deeply critical of the honours system as operated by Eccles, complaining that the encouragement of boys to inform on each other created a culture of fear. He wrote in Graham Greene’s anthology The Old School that \\"The best reason I have for opposing Fascism is that at school I lived in a Fascist state.\\"Benson (2002), p. 39 Eccles used much of his salary for improving the school.

H. Auden and Benjamin Britten. He was \\"obsessed with punctuality and tidiness, particularly picking up litter\\".

Fifteen of the sixteen people on board were killed. This aircraft was also the last civil Boeing 707 in operation. Aircraft A Saha Boeing 707-3J9C, similar to the one involved in the accident The aircraft involved was a Boeing 707-3J9C, c/n 21128, registration EP-CPP. The aircraft was owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force and had been leased to Saha Airlines. The aircraft was 42 years old at the time. The aircraft had first flown on 19 November 1976 and was delivered that month to the Imperial Iranian Air Force as 5-8312. It had been transferred to Saha Airlines on 27 February 2000, and was re-registered EP- SHK. It was substantially damaged by an uncontained engine failure on 3 August 2009, whilst on a flight from Ahvaz International Airport to Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran. An emergency landing was made at Ahvaz; the aircraft was subsequently repaired. It was returned to the IRIAF in December 2015 and returned to Saha Airlines in May 2016, registered EP-CPP. Accident Tail wreckage of EP-CPP The aircraft was on an international cargo flight carrying meat from Manas International Airport in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, to Payam International Airport in Karaj, Iran, but the flight crew actually landed at Fath Air Base. The crew probably mistook Fath Air Base's runway with the much longer Payam International Airport runway, as the two runways are just a few kilometres apart, and on an almost identical alignment. A 707 generally requires a runway length more than , but the runway at Fath Air Base is only . Poor weather conditions were also reported. The aircraft overran the runway, crashed through a wall, and came to rest after colliding with a house in the neighbourhood of Farrokhabad, Fardis County, Alborz Province. The houses involved were empty at the time of the crash, and no one on the ground was injured. Following the crash, a fire developed. Early reports gave the number of people on board as either 16 or 17 (one a woman), all but one of whom died. The sole survivor was Farshad Mahdavinejad, the aircraft's flight engineer, who was taken to Shariati Hospital in a critical condition. In a possibly related incident from 16 November 2018, a Taban Airlines MD-88 carrying 155 people twice attempted to land on this runway, mistaking it for the longer Payam runway, which is nearly in line. On its first approach, the plane reached an altitude of before aborting the attempt, but eventually continued on for a safe landing at Payam after an aborted second attempt at Fath. Investigation An investigation was opened into the accident. The cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the wreckage on 14 January. The flight data recorder and the control display unit were also recovered.

It closed as a subscription library in 1971 and re-opened as a public facility in 1973 under the name of the Watt Library, specialising in Local History and Archives. The building was designed in the Gothic revival style by architect Sir Edward Blore and is a listed building. It has undergone recent refurbishment and re-opened in November 2019 as the Watt Institution, incorporating the McLean Museum Watt Lecture Hall and Inverclyde Archives.  History  The Watt Library is the direct descendant of the Greenock Library, founded in 1783 as a subscription library. James Watt was a patron of the library and on his death, members of the James Watt Club proposed erecting a memorial to him in the form of a new library building and statue. The initial drawings for the building were created at a different site near the Well Park in Greenock by William Burn but were not followed through, instead the drawings of Sir Edward Blore, who had completed Buckingham Palace, were used. The new library building was opened in 1837 with the statue being erected the following year. The building has been given Listed status, Category A by Historic Scotland. Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey sculpted the impressive marble statue of James Watt which is on permanent display inside the Library. The Watt Library was closed for refurbishment in 2018 and will opened again in 2019 incorporating the McLean Museum and Art Gallery, Watt Hall and Inverclyde Archives under the original name of the Watt Institution. This opening is timed to coincide with the year of celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the death of James Watt after whom the library is named. The Watt Library is open on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday between 10am-4pm. The library holds local history reference materials, access to family history resources and archive material can be viewed by appointment with the Archivist Lorraine Murray.  Collections  In 2012, a rare book collection was discovered in a cupboard hidden by a plan chest by the former Watt Library Archivist. The collection included volumes on surgery, witchcraft and exploration dating from the 17th and 18th century. Other notable discoveries included an illustrated edition of Paradise Lost from 1827 engraved by the artist John Martin, letters by Cicero from 1538 and a Hamnet edition of Shakespeare plays from the 19th century published in Greenock. The collection was put on display at the McLean Museum in 2012.

A temporary exhibit for 2019 will feature an aquarium of living jellyfish. Location The museum can be found on Vor dem Neutor, close to Jena Paradies station and only about 150m from the town centre. It is open Tuesday to Sunday except for Christmas and New Year, and there is a small fee for entry. cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika History Collections of zoological specimens which had been assembled in Jena in the 18th and 19th Centuries were donated to the museum. Some items date back to when Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was director of the university's antomical-zoological collection. The museum building was designed in an Art Nouveau style by the architect Carl Dittmar, based on sketches by Ernst Haeckel, then built in 1907 (construction beginning on 28 August 1907) and given by Haeckel to the University of Jena on 30 July 1908, as a gesture to mark the university's 350th anniversary, but no permanent exhibits were placed in the museum until 1912. The walls are decorated with scientific terms coined by Haeckel - 'Phylogenie' and 'Ontogenie'. In 2008, a light show was projected on the building as part of the 'Jena Leuchtet' event. Today the museum is part of the university's department of special zoology and evolutionary biology and stores 500,000 items. References * H.

He served as Medical Director of the Culion leper colony from 1922 to 1959. Early career Starting in 1906, Wade trained as a tissue pathologist with Frank Burr Mallory at the Boston City Hospital. In 1908 he moved to Montreal to assist Charles Duval, an associate of Mallory's. He began medical studies at McGill University there, and continued at Tulane University when Duval moved there in 1909. Wade received his medical degree from Tulane in 1912 and remained there for three more years as an instructor in pathology and a resident at the Charity Hospital at New Orleans. During his time at Tulane Wade became interested in leprosy research, which was an interest of his mentor Dr. Duval. Wade developed a relationship with the leprosy colony at Carville, Louisiana, then known as the Louisiana Leper Home. Philippines In 1915, Wade married Dorothy Paul of New Orleans and accepted a job as a pathologist-bacteriologist at the Bureau of Science in Manila. Once he arrived in 1916 he was quickly appointed the chairman of the Leprosy Examining Committee of the Board of Health of Manila. In the course of his duties he developed the \\"scraped incision\\" method of making skin smears, an important advance in detection. In 1918 Wade was appointed head of the Department of Pathology and Bacteriology at the College of Medicine and Surgery at the University of the Philippines.\\"Dr. H. W.

He was to be engaged in research there for the rest of his life. In 1925 Governor Leonard Wood sent Dorothy Wade back to the United States to raise money for leprosy treatment and research; in association with fundraiser Perry Burgess, they founded an organization which became (after Leonard Wood's death in 1927) the Leonard Wood Memorial for the Eradication of Leprosy, with Dr. Wade as the chief medical officer. The funds raised supported the Leonard Wood Memorial Research Laboratory at Culion, which Wade headed. Wade was the chairman of the Leonard Wood Memorial Conference on Leprosy in Manila in 1931, which resulted in the founding of the International Leprosy Foundation. Wade became the first editor of the Foundation's International Journal of Leprosy and remained involved with it until 1963.

It is located at the point where several planned energy pipelines will pass, as a means to block the crossing of Wetʼsuwetʼen territory by pipeline-related industries. Located by road from Vancouver, BC and about 130 km from the town of Smithers, it is on the shores of the Wedzin Kwah (or Morice River) at the mouth of Gosnell Creek. These are both tributaries of the Skeena, Bulkley, and Babine rivers. Members of the Unisʼtotʼen clan, First Nations peoples, and other supporters staff the camp. The Wetʼsuwetʼen have built a checkpoint some east of the camp, on the Morice West Forest Service Road. At this point, visitors must have prior consent to enter the territory and the Wetʼsuwetʼen have barred construction workers and equipment. In 2019, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline went to court to enforce the permission granted by the Wetʼsuwetʼen and other First Nations band councils to build in the area. A court decision in 2020 granted an injunction against the Unisʼtotʼen clan and its supporters. In February 2020, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) dismantled the blockades and checkpoints on the Morice Road to enforce the injunction. After the RCMP's actions, there have been numerous protests across Canada supporting the Wetʼsuwetʼen. History The camp was set up in 2010 by hereditary chiefs of the Wetʼsuwetʼen First Nation, who opposed several elected Wet'suwet'en band councils which signed agreements to build the pipeline. At the exact points where pipelines were intended to cross the Unistʼotʼen Territory of Talbits Kwah, a traditional pithouse and permaculture garden were built. The camp also includes several small greenhouses and a secure all-season bunkhouse. The camp was constructed as a means to block the development of numerous pipelines and other projects deemed harmful to the land. These include pipelines from Enbridge, the Pacific Trails Pipeline (Chevron), as well as seven proposed pipelines from the Alberta Oil Sands and LNG from the Horn River Basin Projects in the Peace River Region. In 2015, the Unistʼotʼen released a declaration which included this statement: > \\"The Unistʼotʼen settlement camp is not a protest or a demonstration. Our > clan is occupying and using our traditional territory as it has for > centuries. Our free, prior, and informed consent protocol is in place at the > entrance of our territory as an expression of our jurisdiction and our > inherent right to both give and refuse consent and entry into our > territory.\\" The camp is the site of activities related to healing and learning. Construction of a healing centre began in 2015. The healing centre welcomes people to reconnect with the land, learn cultural practices, and recover from health issues such as substance abuse, using traditional Indigenous methods. According to the traditional beliefs of the Wetʼsuwetʼen people, healing can come from being connected to the land and that the impacts of colonialism, including living away from traditional territories, are harmful. A youth camp provides opportunities for young people to learn and practice their culture. Indigenous sovereignty and title Underlying issues of the protest include Indigenous sovereignty and Aboriginal title. The Wetʼsuwetʼen system of governance pre-dates the formation of the country of Canada, and members of the Wetʼsuwetʼen people have never signed a treaty with the Canadian government. For many Indigenous peoples in Canada, the recognition of traditional title to land is of vital importance and pre-cedes colonial law and impositions. In 1984, the Wetʼsuwetʼen and Gitxsan First Nations sued the BC Government over the granting of clear-cut logging in their territories. In 1991, the BC Supreme Court ruled that Aboriginal title was extinguished in 1858, prior to Confederation and the Nations had no right to stop the logging. This was appealed by the Wetʼsuwetʼen and Gitxsan First Nations to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that Aboriginal title had not been extinguished. It ordered a new trial, but recommended negotiation. Treaty negotiations broke down after the BC government refused to agree to the nations having sovereignty over more than 4-6 per cent of its traditional territory. The Canadian government's continued support for extraction industries over the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty and adhesion to the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), of which Canada is a signatory, is a major friction point in some segments of contemporary Canadian society. Unist'otʼen checkpoint conflict Members of the Unistoten Camp behind a checkpoint sign. The sign reads: No access without consent. Several kilometres east of the camp, the Wetʼsuwetʼen set up a checkpoint on the Morice River Forest Services Road, controlling access to the area. The area was blocked to the pipeline project. In 2018, TC Energy was granted an injunction to remove the checkpoint and have complete access to the pipeline project construction. In January 2019, the RCMP entered the territory to enforce the court injunction and allow workers from the Coastal GasLink pipeline project temporary access to the area. The RCMP arrested 14 people on January 8 at the checkpoint. The pipeline workers completed their pre- construction work. Afterwards, the blockades were rebuilt. Supporters of the blockade consider the action taken at the Unisʼtotʼen checkpoint and the lack of consultation with hereditary chiefs to be violations of the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Many Indigenous peoples have written and discussed the ways this action will impact the Canadian government's efforts to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report, with many notable Indigenous peoples such as broadcaster Jesse Wente, speaking at rallies and protests. In December 2019, the injunction was re-instated. Another round of discussions ended without the pipeline proponents convincing the hereditary chiefs and their supporters to withdraw. The RCMP returned to the area in 2020 and arrests began again as the RCMP cleared the Morice Forest Service Road, including the arrests of Wet'suwet'en matriarchs. Supporters of the blockade remained in residences along the road, including the camp. The arrests sparked widespread protests in BC and across Canada in support of the Wet'suwet'en. Solidarity statements supporting the preservation of the Unistʼotʼen Camp were issued by organizations and institutions such as: OCAD University, the British Columbia Teachers' Federation, Ryerson University School of Social Work.

Facts Evans claimed he was unjustly dismissed as a probationary constable. He received good progress reports. The Chief Constable interviewed him and asked him to resign rather than formally firing him on the grounds that Evans (1) married a woman much older than himself, the former mistress of his uncle, which ostensibly might have been a scandal for the force, (2) he was keeping four dogs in a police council house, which had a one dog limit, and (3) Evans and his wife lived a “hippy” lifestyle. Evans argued that if he had been able to choose between his dogs and his career, the dogs would have gone. Judgment The House of Lords held the Chief Officer’s discretion under the Police Regulations 1971 was not absolute, but qualified and could only be exercised if the probationer was unfit for office or unlikely to become an efficient constable, in accordance with natural justice. The supposedly adverse factors were never put to Evans. However, an order for mandamus for reinstatement would usurp the Chief Constable’s powers, so declaring the action void was unsatisfactory. Instead, Evans would have a declaration affirming an unlawfully induced resignation and could get damages. Lord Brightman said the following.[1982] 1 WLR 1155, 1173 Lord Hailsham LC, Lord Fraser, Lord Roskill, Lord Bridge gave concurring opinions.

It serves regional passenger traffic from Łódź Kaliska station to Zgierz, Łowicz, Kutno and Toruń.  History  Initially, in 1910, the site of station served as guard post, securing a single-level crossing between the Warsaw-Kalisz Railway and a tram line between Łódź and Aleksandrów. The first building at the station was erected in 1951. Five years later a viaduct for Aleksandrowska street and tram tracks were constructed south to the station. In 1972 the passenger section of the station, consisting of two single-edged platforms and an underground passage between them and the neighbouring streets, was opened south to the viaduct, leaving the already existing part of station for cargo service.  Current state  The station's building was repurposed after 2010, due to closure of cash office. It has been adapted to serve as a restaurant. The underground passage is notorious for being flooded during heavy rains. Refurbishment of the passage and reconstruction of the platforms began in 2019. The station is a crucial point for cargo transportation, as it serves branch lines to the production plants located in , as well as EC-3 power plant.

It is mainly found in Europe, though it is also known from Kazakhstan and Turkey in Asia. In the literature, the species is usually listed as including two subspecies, Chrysochus asclepiadeus asclepiadeus and Chrysochus asclepiadeus asiaeminoris.

In 2015, Ekiz et al. found that the two subspecies are not geographically distinct, and concluded that C. a. asiaeminoris is actually a synonym of the nominate subspecies. Description C. asclepiadeus has a dark blue body with a purplish metallic reflection. Adult males have an average length of 9.3 mm and an average width of 4.9 mm. Adult females are generally similar to males, but larger; they have an average length of 10.2 mm and average width of 5.4 mm.

In her book, Plea for a Measure of Abnormality, psychoanalyst Joyce McDougall coined the term normopathy to describe fear of individuality. Normopathy is difficult to diagnose because normopaths are integrated in society. Normopaths depend on social approval and validation. Christopher Bollas studied normopathy during the 1970s and 1980s with patients who had nervous breakdowns. Bollas, who called it normotic illness, considered it an obsession with fitting into society at the cost of the person's own personality. Normopaths experience emotional crisis – such as a teenager fumbling a football during a game at school – as a mania, and resort to violence or other dangerous behavior. Normopaths often feel crippled, unable to speak or act. Normopaths perform best given a strict protocol to follow. It can cost some people a job or interfere with relationships. Normopaths constantly seek outside validation. The normopath may ask a friend what they think about a new song, dress or hairstyle before forming an opinion. Normopaths look to others to inform them how to think or believe. The concept of normopathy parallels Winnicott’s idea of the false self, which is formed in response to the demands of the external environment rather than from within. Cognitive behavioral therapy is applied in treatment of normopathy to find individuality and restructure self-image.  Definition  Normopathy is defined as: * Anxiety of examining one’s psyche with diminished curiosity about inner life. * Hyper-rationality in dealing with others and an intense focus on factual data to seek reassurance, as according to Bollas, “the normopath attempts to become an object in the object world.” For the normopath, human feelings are troublemakers that require “formulaic structuring in order to be controllable.” Because Normopaths can't fully go through the cycle of grief, they develop what Bollas calls “a strangely deformed mourning.\\" * Loss of connection between feeling and speech. * Horizontal thinking, the inability to prioritize and create relative values and meaning. * Homogeneity, all ideas and actions seem equally valid. Fumbling a ball and suicide reside on the same phenomenological plane as actions are wildly out of sync with affect. * Operational thinking, turning thought immediately into action.

Conservative Party campaign strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, who is a patron of Patchwork, described Bokhari as “Captain Networker”  Career  Bokhari graduated from Imperial College, London in 1999 with a BSc in Mathematics. Bokhari is a chartered accountant. In 2006, Bokhari was a manager at the London branch of 1st Ethical, founded by Sufyan Ismail.

He was awarded the Beacon Award for Philanthropy Advocate for raising £1 million within 12 months for various charities working in deprived communities in the UK. = Naz Legacy Foundation = Bokhari is also founder of the Naz Legacy Foundation, which was established in honour of the legacy of his father, Naz Bokhari, the first Muslim secondary school head-teacher in Britain. The Naz Legacy Foundation received Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society Award in 2014. Bokhari's interfaith work has included organising the first ever engagement event between national community, women and youth leaders from the Jewish and Muslim communities meeting with the new Chief Rabbi in Finchley Kinloss Synagogue. He was one of the first Muslims to be invited to the Chief Rabbi's installation ceremony. He also organised the first youth interfaith iftar at Lambeth Palace, which brought together the Archbishop of Canterbury, Chief Rabbi, Mayor of London and over 100 youth leaders from each of London's boroughs. In 2013, Bokhari organised the Woolwich interfaith event following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, which brought together politicians and faith leaders like Nick Clegg the then Deputy Prime Minister, to unite British communities after the attacks. In 2019, Bokhari led Naz Legacy Foundation organised interfaith event with the Chief Rabbi and the Archbishop of Canterbury, held at the Regent Park Mosque's Islamic Cultural Centre. The event, offering condolences over Christchurch attacks was joined by over 250 leading faith and civil society leaders as well the Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. = Other notable recognition = Bokhari was awarded an OBE in Her Majesty's Birthday Honours List in 2015, and was listed as an 'Equality Champion' in the Evening Standard's Progress 1000 list of most influential Londoners. He also won the Alija Izetbegovic Award for Good Citizenship from the Muslim News Awards in 2016. Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote praised Bokhari's work \\"for his services to young people and interfaith... With his easy charm and steely determination Bokhari can call upon the top political figures to talk to the young men and women on his schemes. He’s even become an ambassador for the HRH Prince Charles. Well done Harris, your father, who also received an OBE, would be deeply proud of his son.\\"  Muslim Association of Britain activism  Bokhari is described as a spokesperson for the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) by The Guardian and other sources. In the same period, he was a national affiliate representative for the Muslim Council of Britain from 2007-2008. By 2007, Bokhari was appointed Press Officer of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB).  Position on Israel  In 2002, Bokhari organised protests in London, attended by thousands of people “to express their solidarity with the Palestinians and against Israel's ongoing military operations in the West Bank.\\" \\"Some protesters carried posters depicting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon behind bars and comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler,\\" reported Ha'aretz, which said that MAB were the \\"organisers\\" of the event. At the event Bokhari called for a boycott of Israeli goods, and Jeremy Corbyn demanded that there should be \\"no arms, no money, no recognition and no support for Israel.\\" In 2019, Bokhari organized the first inter-faith Iftari with the Chief Rabbi at St John's Wood synagogue. It resulted in a number of synagogues across London organising their own Iftars. Bokhari reportedly said: “We need to call out all forms of prejudice and racism in society and it is important we speak out against anti- semitism in the same way we have to speak out against Islamophobia.” Bokhari who has been described as a “leading Muslim voice in the fight against antisemitism” was the only “Muslim leader” to join a private reception with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown at the 17th Annual Isaiah Berlin Lecture, held at Hampstead Synagogue. The reception was reported to be attended by “leading members of the Jewish community” including the Israeli ambassador and the president of the Board of Deputies.  Position on UK foreign policy  In 2006, three Muslim Labour MPs—Mohammed Sarwar, Sadiq Khan and Shahid Malik—together with 38 Muslim organisations signed a letter warning that “current British government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in Britain and abroad”. The MAB was one of the organisations that signed this letter. In his capacity as spokesperson for MAB, Bokhari told Socialist Worker magazine: “We have been saying that British foreign policy is a problem since day one, even before the war in Afghanistan”, and warned that if British foreign policy did not change, terrorism on UK soil would be inevitable. He went on to say: “And it is not just Muslims saying this. The two million who marched against war in Iraq were not majority Muslim. The 100,000 that marched against the war in Lebanon and Gaza are not majority Muslim. The Chatham House foreign policy research institute has been saying it. A lot of people up and down the country are very upset about Britain’s foreign policy. We would be ignoring our moral duty if we did not speak out. And it’s very naive for ministers to say that this not a problem.”  Position on core British values  In 2006, Bokhari was asked by the BBC about his reaction to a British government proposal to incorporate teaching of \\"core British values\\" into citizenship classes in schools to help \\"tackle extremism and discrimination.\\" In response to the previous year's London bombings, ministers wanted citizenship classes in schools to promote values shared by all communities across society, \\"such as freedom, fairness, civil responsibilities and democracy.\\" In his capacity as a spokesperson for the Muslim Association of Britain, Bokhari rejected the proposal: \\"This is just another one of those knee-jerk reactions where we're not actually looking at the core problem. What was the reason why these people actually committed these disgusting acts? Unfortunately it was our foreign policy, it was the issue of the illegal war, the illegal occupation of Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the continuing abuses of the Palestinian people, the illegal occupation of Palestine by the Israeli state. So I think until the government actually addresses these issues unfortunately we'll keep on having these problems in the UK particularly.\\"  Position on Danish cartoons  In February 2006, Bokhari was interviewed following the publication and distribution of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed concerning calls by Muslim groups to boycott the West. Speaking on the incident, Bokhari said: 'We live in a democratic society and have the right to choose what we buy. International companies have an influence over governments and the media, and can also influence global politics. They have to understand that if they're going to cause offence, then we’re not going to buy their products.\\" Bokhari believes the boycott will spread to products made in other countries and predicts Germany will be next after several newspapers defended their right to publish the cartoons.  Position on Ahmadiyya Community  In 2010, according to The New Yorker, Harris Bokhari told a group of British Muslims to vote for Labour Party candidate Sadiq Khan instead of Liberal Democrat candidate Nasser Butt, a member of the Ahmadiyya sect. “The majority of Muslims in this area are voting Lib Dem, because they think Nasser Butt is a Muslim,” Bokhari reportedly told a room of Muslim voters as the reason why they should not vote for Butt. “You need to go into the community and take these posters down…. All you need to do is just look for Sadiq Khan, Labour Party, and just tick it… Whatever else you vote is up to you.” Bokhari later told the author of this report that he \\"does not remember the meeting\\". After the election, Nasser Butt claimed that Khan's Muslim supporters had rallied around the Tooting Islamic Centre to campaign against the Lib Dem candidate due to his religion. A secret recording of a meeting at the Tooting mosque two days before polling revealed that the main voice for this approach was Harris Bokhari. Your Local Guardian reported that recordings of the event caught Bokhari telling Muslim attendees not to vote for Butt because of his Ahmadiyya affiliation, as this meant that he was not a Muslim. In the recording, Bokhari is heard to tell the audience: “The majority of Muslims in this area are voting Lib Dem, because they think Nasser Butt is a Muslim. If you don’t go in and speak to them, they’re not going to do it. They’re fed up of hearing it from the imams. They want to hear it from you. They need you to go into the community and say ‘Why are you supporting the Qadiani community?’” In 2017, Bokhari talked about his work with young people from minority faith communities who face prejudices, including youth in the Ahmadiyya community. In 2019, he wrote in the Independent and the Evening Standardcalling out the precaution and hatred against towards the Ahmadiyya community.  Work on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE)  In July 2019, Bokhari, a grassroots expert in Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) was invited to attend the Home Secretary's speech, Confronting Extremism Together. Bokhari, who organised the Woolwich interfaith event following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013 and the Christchurch vigil at Islamic Cultural Centre and memorial at New Zealand House in 2019, was invited by the US State Department on their International Visitor Leadership Programme on CVE in 2017.

Conduct Left-wing candidates claimed that the Ministry of the Interior, headed by coup leader Magloire, had rigged the results. This view was supported by the American embassy after the discovery of the mass sale of electoral cards in the week preceding the elections.Smith, p90 Aftermath An outbreak of violence two days after the elections left five people dead.

O. dichotoma can be found in climates from the arctic to the tropics in protected waters such as marches and creeks but not near open coasts like beaches in depths up to 250m. O. dichotoma uses asexual and sexual reproduction and feeds on mainly zooplankton and fecal pellets. Obelia dichotoma has a complex relationship with the ecosystem and many economic systems.  Description  A thecate hydroid with a hydrotheca long enough to enclose the hydranth, feeding polyp, when fully contracted. The bell or goblet shaped hydrotheca lacks an operculum, but contains a diaphragm at the base and changes to a brown color over time. The rim of the hydrotheca is smooth or softly toothed and can be used to distinguish O. dichotoma from other Obelia species. O. dichotoma polyp heigh ranges from 215-300 μm and diameter from 210-275 μm. The colony of O. dichotoma forms slender alternative branching stems with hydrocauli up to 350 mm tall with the hydranths located on thin stalks. The medusae of O. dichotoma swim freely in water and are disk shaped with 16 or more tentacles. The medusae tentacles are not highly specialized but contain nematocysts grouped in rings. = Distinction from Obelia sp.= Obelia dichotoma can be distinguished from other species using the morphological traits of the organism. Obelia bidentata has toothed rims on the hydrotheca and, unlike O. dichotoma, older parts of the colony do not turn brown. Obelia geniculata is unbranched and usually lives on brown algae. Obelia dichotoma can be distinguished from Clytia spp. by counting tentacle numbers because Clytia have less than 16 tentacles. Another genus, Gonothyraea, can be distinguished from O. dichotoma because medusae remains attached to the polyps and is not free swimming.  Distribution and habitat  Obelia dichotoma is widely distributed throughout protected marine and freshwaters and, like many other hydroids, colonies attach to structures such as pilings, debris, seaweeds, grasses, and barnacles at depths from <25m up to 275m. O. dichotoma is relatively uncommon in the open coast such as beach areas. This hydroid has been found on both coasts of the U.S., Mediterranean Sea, around Australia, and the southern tip of Africa.  Biology  = Life cycle = Obelia dichotoma house the reproductive polyps in the angles of the branches. The polyps develop and bud off to form medusae about 0.05 mm in diameter at release that grow to about 5 mm at maturity. The medusae are either male or female with nematocysts on tentacles and produce either sperm or eggs. The fertilized egg develops into a planula larvae that settle out of the water column during the winter, spring, and early summer and grow colonies for 2-3 months. = Feeding and digestion = { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 11.813392639160158, 78.95308801555372 ] } } ] } Hydroids are usually considered to be carnivorous organisms that feed mainly on zooplankton and, while this is generally accepted for Obelia dichotoma, a study of the O. dichotoma population in the Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen, Arctic) found that this population was more omnivorous in nature based on their diet. This population had a diet high in fecal pellets, organic matter, and micro algae which may be due to an environmental adaptation to the high content of these substances in the waters. This adaptation may also be attributed to the large fluctuations of zooplankton populations in this area of the Arctic. Obelia dichotoma, being one of the smaller species of hydroids, has inherent difficulty capturing prey whereas Tubalaria larynx, a larger species, that is mainly carnivorous, has the ability to capture prey with ease. Digestion time for cnidarians is highly dependent on the temperature and conditions of the environment each organism is in. The same study in the Kongsfjorden, found that O. dichotoma had a digestion time for diatoms of about 20 hours at 6°C.  Environmental impact  = Influences on environment = Obelia dichotoma, along with many other hydroids, are responsible for a large impact on many marine fish farming industries through fouling properties. In particular, the finfish industry in the Mediterranean Sea has been impacted by O. dichotoma and similar hydroids in two ways. These hydroids attach to multiple structures used in the industry including ropes, nets, pilings, and cages and add weight and drag to the equipment. The hydroids can also invade the gills of the farmed fish and cause disease and other problems for the quality of the fish. O. dichotoma can cause envenomations and gill disorders through contact with the fish provided by the close proximity in the farm. = Influences of environment = { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ -82.34235763549806, 23.13609796086044 ] } } ] } Not only can O. dichotoma have a negative impact on the environment through disease and obstruction, the O. dichotoma can also benefit from environmental impact humans have on the oceanic environment. Most hydroids and similar organisms, respond negatively to increasing concentrations of fecal matter in the aqueous environment but, according to a 2018 study of the coral reefs in Havana Harbour, Cuba, O. dichotoma along with a few other species were found to have a positive reaction to increasing fecal matter concentrations in the environment. Human interaction has an immense influence on the environment, while some are positive many are also negative, particularly in the form of over-harvesting, climate change through pollution, and habitat destruction all of which are most common in coastal regions, one of O. dichotoma's primary habitats. Human interaction also involves contaminants to the environment. Such contaminants can be metals which benefit the ecosystem at trace levels or artificial chemical which can have unknown consequences ranging from beneficial to extremely dangerous. Human interaction along with invasive species contribute to environmental disturbance which influences the diversity and abundance in ecosystems. Diversity within an ecosystem has shown to have a humped shaped relation to the productivity of that ecosystem where diversity increases productivity to a critical point then decreases. For the most part hydroids, and other benthic or benthopelagic organisms show negative consequences, decreased diversity and abundance, to increased disturbance in the ecosystem, but Obelia dichotoma has been shown to benefit from increased disturbance in the environment showing an increase in abundance and area of coverage in more disturbed conditions. The abnormality of O. dichotoma to proliferate under circumstances where similar competitors struggle is an adaptation that, for some unknown reason, occurred and made O. dichotoma unique.

It is at the northwestern end of the boundary between New Jersey and New York, the northern end of the boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the eastern end of the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania. The monument is located at the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink rivers. This location is also known as Carpenter's Point. The nearby Witness Monument, also known as the Reference Monument or the western State Line Monument, is a taller upright granite monument located south of the Laurel Grove Cemetery in Port Jervis, New York, and under a bridge for Interstate 84. It is not directly on any state boundary, but instead witnesses the location of two points: this tripoint and the corner boundary point between New York and Pennsylvania in the Delaware River. The Supreme Court of the United States summarized the boundaries of these three states with respect to this monument in New Jersey v. New York, 283 U.S. 336 (1931): Also, it is the northernmost point of New Jersey, in Montague Township, Sussex County. Background In 1664, King Charles II of England granted his brother, James, the Duke of York, a Royal colony that covered what had been New Netherlands. Later in 1664, the Duke of York divided this area between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton. The western and northern border was to be: History In December 1872, the New Jersey Geological Survey had the State Geologist, George H. Cook, survey the boundary between New Jersey and New York. In 1874, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey recovered the previous crow foot cut marking the station location and placed a lead-filled copper pipe in a deep hole drilled into the bedrock. In 1882, this copper bolt was replaced with a granite monument similar to the witness monument. But ice flows broke off the upper portion by the spring of 1883. The remaining monument was then reworked on May 21, 1885 to its current description. Description Top view of the Tri-States Monument The Tri- States Monument is long, wide, and high above the bedrock. The top surface is engraved with the initials of the names of the three states and with grooves representing the state boundaries. \\"Tri States Monument\\" is engraved on the north side. It is by the water's edge near the high-water mark of the rivers. A bronze U.S. National Geodetic Survey survey marker stamped LAUREL NO. 2 1942 was in the center of the top surface until 2013. It was a reference mark for the triangulation station, LAUREL, that was from the Witness Monument. Both were set in 1942. The Witness Monument is inscribed \\"Boundary Monument\\" and dated 1882 on both sides. \\"Witness Monument\\" is engraved on the east side.

It was founded in 1890 by the author Louise Creighton and the women's activist Kathleen Lyttelton. Its members, most of whom were married to Cambridge academics, were believers in women’s education and were active in the campaign to grant women Cambridge degrees. Most were strong supporters of female suffrage. The society remained active until the First World War. It has been stated that the Society stands \\"as a testament to friendship and intellectual debate at a time when women’s voices went largely unheard.\\"  Background  Until the late 1870s, almost all college fellows had been prohibited from marrying, with only a few exceptions such as University professors and Heads of Houses. The revision of the University statutes in 1878 ushered in the establishment of the first women's colleges and an era of greater participation of women in university life, although dining in college remained the norm for male fellows with wives being excluded from high tables. It was against this background that Kathleen Lyttelton suggested to her friend Louise Creighton that they should start a ladies dining club. In 1890, the pair invited a select group of nine (later ten) of their married friends to join their society, \\"not without an idea of retaliating on the husbands who dined in College.\\"Quoted in Kennedy Smith 2018 Several of their friends’ husbands were members of an elite society, the Cambridge Apostles, which may have provided inspiration. The society was one of a growing number of women's associations which were formed in Britain during the 1880s and 1890s, and it has been said that at that date \\"even to form a ladies’ social club was a mild assertion of women’s right to public space\\". The society members were believers in women’s education, and were active in the campaign to grant women Cambridge degrees. Most were strong supporters of female suffrage. The members took it in turn to host once or twice a term, leaving their husbands either to dine at their colleges or to eat a solitary meal in their studies. The hostess not only provided a good dinner (though champagne was not allowed) but also a suitable topic of conversation, if needed. The hostess was also allowed to introduce a guest for dinner. Conversation was to be kept general, Louise Creighton having strong views against what she called 'sub-committees'. It was an exclusive society, one black ball being enough to exclude a proposed new member. Although the group nominated one of their number to act as secretary, no records of their discussions are believed to survive.

Member details Louise Creighton, author and women's activist, was married to Mandell Creighton, Professor in ecclesiastical history. In 1885, she had founded the National Union of Women Workers with Lady Laura Ridding and Emily Janes in order to co-ordinate the voluntary efforts of women across Great Britain.Serena Kelly, 'Ridding [née Palmer], Lady Laura Elizabeth (1849–1939)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 22 November 2017 She was its first president. Kathleen Lyttelton, author and women's activist, was married to Arthur Lyttelton, first master of Selwyn College. In 1884 she had founded The Cambridge Association For Women's Suffrage (CAWS) along with Millicent Fawcett, and had joined the Executive of The Central Society For Women’s Suffrage. She was also active with the Cambridge Women's Refuge, helping to raise funds for what would become the Cambridge Association for the Care of Girls which aimed to provide poor local girls with practical help with domestic economy and literacy. Eleanor Sidgwick in 1889 Eleanor Sidgwick, physicist, psychic researcher and Principal of Newham College, was married to Henry Sidgwick, Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy. She was said to have been a reserved, rather aloof figure but Louise Creighton recalled her shining on these occasions: \\"I have never anywhere else seen her more alive & interested. She used to quite flush with excitement\\". Other members had connections with Newnham, too. Margaret Verrall was a classicist and lecturer at the college who, according to a friend \\"was very easily bored and disliked stale or fruitless controversy\\". Ellen Wordsworth Darwin in 1903 Ellen Wordsworth Darwin was a cousin of Henry Sidgwick who had taught English literature at Newnham from 1878 until 1883, but had given it up after her marriage to the botanist Francis Darwin and the birth of their daughter Frances. She was strongly agnostic and took her discussions seriously, a friend observing \\"It was at once distracting and delightfully amusing to hear her say, as she not infrequently did, 'I know I’m right'\\". Mary Ward in about 1875 Mary Ward was a lecturer at Newnham and was married to the philosopher James Ward. In 1879 she had been the first woman to be awarded a Class I in the Moral Sciences Tripos. She was a promoter of women’s education at Cambridge and was active in the suffrage movement, her play Man and Woman featuring on suffrage programmes for a number of years. She acted as honorary secretary of the Cambridge Women’s Suffrage Association from 1905 until 1915. It was said of her that her \\"quick Irish speech bubbled out when she was excited. Life was full of the urge of things to fight for\\". Mary Marshall was an economics lecturer at Newnham College and was married to Alfred Marshall, professor of political economy. Writing to Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol College, Oxford she reported \\"The 'Eleven' dined on Tuesday at Mrs George Darwin's. The Eleven are, you know, eleven ladies who leave their husbands behind, and dress well & dine well for their own satisfaction, & claim they talk well too, though perhaps some people wd not admit it\\". Ida Darwin was married to Horace Darwin, the Cambridge scientific instrument maker and son of Charles Darwin. She campaigned for the passing of the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913, was one of the founders of the Cambridge Association for the Care of the Feeble-Minded in 1908, and became actively involved in helping Cambridge’s disadvantaged girls to find training and work. According to Louise Creighton, she \\"talked very little but we all liked to have her there\\". Maud Darwin in 1889 The American Maud Darwin, the youngest of the group, was married to George Darwin, Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. According to her eldest daughter, the engraver Gwen Raverat, Maud had arrived in England with a great respect for culture, and eager to learn all she could. Nevertheless, \\"learning was never her strong point\\", and her real interest was people. She campaigned for the introduction of women police officers in Britain, publishing an article in The Nineteenth Century and After in 1914. A young Caroline Jebb, in 1861 Caroline Jebb was Maud’s aunt and wife of the classical scholar Richard Claverhouse Jebb. Gwen Raverat later recalled her \\"amusing American turn of conversation, complete lack of inhibitions, and great personality\\". Fanny Prothero, who was married to the historian George Prothero, was quieter, Louise Creighton recalling that at that time \\"she always wanted intimate talk with one person\\". Henry James, who later became a close friend and whom she nursed during his final illness, described her as \\"a little Irish lady … full of humour and humanity and curiosity and interrogation—too much interrogation\\". Isy von Hügel's father was the hydrodynamicist and naval architect William Froude and her husband the ethnologist Baron Anatole von Hügel, the first curator of what would become the Cambridge Museum of Archeology and Anthropology. She was active along with her husband in promoting Roman Catholic education at the University. Later years, and legacy In 1891 Mandell Creighton was appointed Bishop of Peterborough, and Louise Creighton reluctantly left Cambridge.

It is inspired by the Chinese novel Journey to the West.  Development  The game entered production in June 2017. Since a part of the Magic Design Studios has worked for Ubisoft on Rayman Legends, there are some similarities in the hand-drawn art style. During development, each level (using the Unity engine) was split into separate scenes so that the multiple people would work on it at the same time.  Gameplay  Unruly Heroes features four characters (Sanzang, Wukong, Kihong and Sandmonk), that can be switched anytime. Each of them have their own unique skills and traits, like double-jump, gliding, or powers activated by special statues. There are character-specific statues that can be used by pushing them into the right place. While the game is based on Journey to the West, it differs a lot compared to it, making an adventure that is more humorous and lighthearted. All levels are done in a Donkey Kong Country-esque way, in which the path forward is always clear, with branching paths along the way that usually lead to extra rewards. The game inherited the combo-based combat system from Prince of Persia while also using puzzles for progression, which is present in all of the 29 levels available. Outside of a single-player adventure, the game can be played with up to four players. In the Underworld, the players will control child versions of the characters. There is also a Player versus Player mode, where battles can be done locally or online.

The name connoted both \\"local\\" and \\"loco\\". The restaurant aspired to serve healthy alternatives to fast food at affordable prices while benefiting communities and disrupting food deserts. The restaurant's first location was in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. History The company's founders, Daniel Patterson, and Roy Choi, were both chefs in California prior to starting Locol. Patterson owned several high-end restaurants, including Coi in San Francisco. Choi owned an “empire” of food trucks, mostly serving tacos with ingredients inspired by Korean cuisine. In 2013, Patterson suffered a bout of depression, began a course of medication, and grew disillusioned with high-end dining. Later in 2013, Patterson saw Choi speak in Copenhagen about his personal and professional experience with poverty in Los Angeles. Choi concluded the talk by rhetorically asking the audience: “What if every high-caliber chef, all of us here, told our investors…that for every fancy restaurant we would build, it would be a requirement to build a restaurant in the hood as well?”. Patterson contacted Choi several months after the talk and together they began fleshing out a menu and business plan. Choi first announced the plans for Locol at MAD Symposium in 2014. The announced goal of the restaurant was to offer healthy food at a competitive price point, with a menu items similar to larger fast food companies such as Burger King and McDonald's. Choi disclosed that the price range for individual items would generally hover between $2 and $6, with an upper limit of $8. In 2014 San Francisco's Tenderloin District was chosen as the location of the first restaurant, with pending second and third locations in Los Angeles and Oakland. After difficulties with the landlord in San Francisco, Choi mentioned the idea for Locol to Aqeela Sherrills, a Los Angeles-based activist. After the conversation, Sherrills temporarily rented a space to Choi and Patterson in Los Angeles. Despite difficulties with construction and permitting, Locol opened on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2016. Celebrities including Jon Favreau, Jim Brown, and Lena Dunham attended the opening. Despite strong sales and attendance at the opening, the restaurant struggled, and most customers did not come from the target audience of Watts residents. After opening and closing two Oakland locations, the flagship Watts branch closed in August 2018. As of August 2018, the space remained in use by Locol as a catering kitchen and event space, and the company continues to operate a Locol food truck. =Legacy= After the closure of the Locol flagship and its conversion to an event space, Patterson opened both a restaurant and a coffee shop (Alta Adams and Adams Coffee Shop, respectively) in Los Angeles. The restaurant takes its name from Patterson's now-closed San Francisco restaurant, Alta. The new restaurant has goals similar to Locol's, and Patterson has referred to it as a \\"[...] sister restaurant\\". Several former Locol employees work at Alta Adams, including chef Keith Corbin, former kitchen manager at Locol. Alta Adams has received positive reviews. Choi has rejected descriptions of Locol's closure as a \\"failure\\" and has indicated there are plans for a \\"3.0\\" version of the chain. Culinary news website Eater included Locol on its list of \\"The Saddest Los Angeles Restaurant Closures of 2018\\". Menu and aesthetic The menu focused on providing healthy and accessible versions of a variety of fast foods, including tacos, burgers, and a chicken sandwich.

The tribe's official site says it signifies that the tribe is \\"always courageous and loyal to America.\\" This article details the effects of white settler contact on the Pawnee tribe, firstly the tribe ceded its land in Nebraska which it had held since the 16th century and was relocated to Oklahoma. Secondly, despite generally having peaceful relations with settlers, there was a loss of life from European-introduced diseases. Lastly came the adoption of European customs, and culture. The Pawnee are a tribe of North American Indigenous people. The tribe was known for peaceful relations with white settlers, earning the classification of a \\"friendly tribe\\". The Pawnee were made up of four bands or subtribes: the Kitkehahki, Chaui, Pitahauerat, and Skidi. These bands lived apart from each other, giving the collective tribe a nature of decentralization.  Loss of land  The Pawnee lived on the Platte River until they were removed from Nebraska by the United States government in the late 19th century. The Pawnee lived on a river in what is now Nebraska for the entirety of their existence before European contact in the 1540s and well into the 19th century. However, over time the Pawnee ceded most of their land in Nebraska to the United States government through19th century treaties. The four Pawnee subtribes gave up their lands south of the Platte River in an 1833 treaty. The tribe was then forced onto a small reservation area on the Loup Fork of the Platte River in an 1857 treaty. By 1874, the tribe had lost all of its land in Nebraska and had been moved to Oklahoma.  Loss of life  The Pawnee generally had peaceful relations with settlers, but this resulted in many negative outcomes. Most conspicuously, involvement with settlers brought massive loss of life to the tribe. The Pawnee suffered from European-introduced diseases, losing over a thousand people to a cholera outbreak in 1849 and suffering further reductions as a result of smallpox in 1852. In addition, the Pawnee suffered losses at the hands of other Plains tribes following their agreement to give up their weapons at the 1833 treaty and become yeoman farmers. The Pawnee also became involved in international conflicts between the French, Spanish, and Americans. The Pawnee had a population between 7,000 and 10,000 people in the early 19th century that dropped to around 2,500 by 1875.  Europeanization  The Europeans also exerted a strong push to Europeanize the Pawnee beginning in the mid-18th century. The Pawnee resisted, but were forced to adopt European customs after 1854 when they were moved to the small reservation. = Goods and services = As a result of European contact, horses and guns were introduced into Pawnee culture by around 1750, combining with the record of trade goods to pinpoint that as the time that settlers became more involved in Pawnee culture. Guns came to replace bow and arrows as the Pawnee's primary weapon just after the turn of the 19th century. The additions of horses and guns had separate but similar effects that made the Pawnee more powerful in the short term. They had been struggling with attacks from other Plains tribes for years, unable to defend themselves effectively due to their decentralized nature. Horses initially served a small role as more powerful versions of dogs in order to haul supplies, but Pawnee herds numbered between 6,000 and 8,000 by the early 19th century (4). The presence of horses made the Pawnee more proficient in hunting buffalo but introduced the distinctly European concept of division of wealth. The British, eager to arm any potential enemies of the Spanish as European powers fought for North America, supplied the Pawnee with guns. The Pawnee gained a distinct fighting advantage over other Plains tribes that lacked this trade relationship with European traders, becoming the dominant tribe of the area into the 19th century. However, they lost this edge in the aforementioned 1833 treaty. Settlers introduced a variety of trade goods into Pawnee culture. European trade goods were a proportionately insignificant percentage of Pawnee materials for 200 years after first contact in the mid-16th century, but accelerated after 1750. Europeans introduced artifacts into all aspects of Pawnee culture, from weapons (iron knives and lead bullets) and tools (awls and axes) to accessories (buttons, bracelets, and brass bells) and ceramics (porcelain and salt glazed stoneware).  Archeological record  Excavation projects carried out between 1930 and 1941 and catalogued by the Nebraska State Historical Society and other published sources portray a development toward European artifacts among Pawnee from 1571 to 1867. The study shows that hardly any European artifacts from before 1800 were found at Pawnee sites, followed by an explosion in European artifacts from 1800 on. By 1833, European artifacts had almost completely replaced those of the Pawnee. = Religion = The Pawnee had a distinct and developed religion built on geographical landmarks and elaborate ritualism before European contact. Priests presided over rituals that commemorated the people's belief in their heavenly origins, and doctors attributed their healing ability to shamanistic powers. The Pawnee believed that animals were the \\"terrestrial media for celestial gods\\", serving as a sort of lower deity that enabled doctors. Therefore, animals were prominently involved in Pawnee religion. However, those traditions disappeared or were marginalized as the tribe became more Europeanized. The greatest example of a change in Pawnee religion as a result of white settler contact was the disappearance of the Morning Star ceremony. Members of one village (Village Across a Hill) in the Skidi subtribe regularly sacrificed a young girl as part of their creation belief, believing that it assisted the renewal of the earth and its resources. The practice took place throughout the 1810s, despite U.S. \\"Indian agents\\" warning that white settlers would not like it, and news of the ceremony reached the Eastern U.S. around 1820. A group of leaders in the village began to oppose the ritual because of white disapproval, and the last known example occurred in 1838.

Yemeni Expedition of 1538  The first Ottoman attempt to conquer Yemen occurred in 1538, after the end of Mamluk rule in Yemen following the end of the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17). The Ottomans weren't able to capture Sana'a cities in Upper Yemen such as Sa'dah, Shaharah and Hajjah remained in the hands of Zaidi imams.  Yemeni Expedition of the 1630s  Another Ottoman attempt to conquer Yemen occurred in the 1630s. However, this expedition ended in a decisive victory for the Zaidi imams, and the Yemeni imams were able to extend their domains from Asir to Hadramaut.  Muhammad Ali's Yemeni Expedition  In the 18th century, the Zaidi State fractured, resulting in the creation of many small Yemeni states such as the Sultanate of Lahej. However, the Ottomans initially proved reluctant to try to reassert their authority in Yemen. In the 1830s, the Ottomans requested Muhammad Ali of Egypt to try to conquer the Arabian peninsula (including Yemen). However, this was met with opposition from the British Empire, which opted to occupy Aden in January 1839. In April 1840, due to pressure from Russia, Austria, and the British Empire, Muhammad Ali withdrew from the Arabian peninsula.  Yemeni Expedition of 1849  In 1849, the Ottomans returned to Yemen once more. In April, they captured Al Hudaydah, and in July, they entered Sana'a on the invitation of the Imam, who wished for Yemen to become a Vassal state under Ottoman protection. This decision was regarded as treacherous by locals, and soon an open revolt occurred. Soon, the Ottomans were forced to withdraw.  Yemeni Expedition of 1872  In 1872, the Ottomans were invited to occupy Sana'a by local nobles who were irritated by the alleged incompetence of the Zaidi imam, allowing the Ottomans to finally conquer Yemen and establish the Yemen Vilayet.  Yemeni Rebellion of 1891  In 1891, A rebellion occurred in Yemen, due to the irreligious conduct of the Ottoman Empire.  Yemeni Rebellion of 1904  In 1904, another rebellion occurred in Yemen. While Arab historian Abdul Yaccob reports it as having started in June 1904, Caesar E. Farah reports that the first serious incident took place on 8 November, when an Ottoman Garrison was attacked and destroyed at Hafash. After the attack on Hafash, Hajjah and Hajur broke out in rebellion. The Rebels then occupied Dhamar and Yarim, and began marching on Taiz and Qatabah. Within a month of the Imam's uprising, the Zaidis had blocked the road between Sana'a and the port of Hodeida, had cut Telegraph wires, suspended caravans and Sana'a was reported as being besieged on 12 December. On 26 December, the Rebels captured the Sinan Pasa post on the Sana'a - Hudaydah road. Turkish reinforcements found themselves repeatedly ambushed by the Zaidis, and by 1905 Ottoman casualties stood at more than 25,000. In early January, Hajjah was under siege by the Rebels. On 22 February, the Rebels surrounded Ibb and Qatabah. In March, the Ottomans broke the siege of Mabar after 4 days of fighting. In March 1905, the Rebels had captured Yarim, and surrounded Ibb, which they had captured by the third week of May together with Qatabah. On 5 March, a 4,000 strong Ottoman force departed from Hudaydah to relieve the siege of Sana'a, but was unable to do so. The Rebels headed for Manakhah, and laid siege to it. In early March, they captured Hajjah. and they captured Manakhah in March. In April 1905, the Zaidis captured Sana'a, and demanded an armistice should the Ottoman garrison be spared, which was accepted. In June 1905, negotiations ensued, but led to nothing.  Yemeni Expedition of 1905  After the failure of Negotiations, Ottoman Forces consisting of 6 battalions led by Ahmad Faydi Pasha violated the armistice, and started a three-pronged offensive from Manakhah on 16 July 1905, and captured Sana'a on 29 or 30 August. In July 1905, the imam of Yemen sent a letter to the Ottomans, detailing his resentment towards the violation of the armistice: \\"We ousted them [the Ottomans] from Sana ... we fixed a truce for one year during which there should be no fighting and both parties should have peace without defiance or violation of the terms. When they, however, reached the place to which they had agreed to retire, they reverted to their former deeds admixed with truth and falsehood. They commenced to violate the terms they have concluded and the undertakings they had agreed to, and to commit evil.\\" By mid-August, the Ottomans had gained the initiative. By the end of that month, they had retaken Abha in Asir. In the south, a Unit moving from Taiz captured Yarim, while another Ottoman force under Feyzi captured Mafraq before advancing on Suq al- Khamis and then while advancing on the road to Saana occupied all positions as far as Khawlan. Feyzi reported he had captured 24 villages, including Jiblah and Badan. By mid-November, the Ottomans had retaken Amran, Thula, Kawkaban, and Hajjah. In mid-November, the Ottomans advanced on Shaharah with 10,000 men, in an attempt to crush the Zaidis, but the offensive was abandoned due to the rugged terrain and constant attacks by Zaidi forces, and they withdrew to Hajjah in December, then to Sana'a, and two weeks later to Taiz, with the Imam in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, the rebels surrounded Amran, and occupied Jabal Dharwah and Al-Yaabir, and later surrounded Sana'a once again. In Hudaydah, the Ottomans regrouped, marching north and recovering control of lost areas near Manakhah. The Ottoman force linked up with another Ottoman force which had been advancing from Zaydiyah to relieve Qifl and recapture Hajjah. In the South, the Ottomans were moving north from Taiz to Yarim after recapturing Suq al-Khamis, after which the Imam offered peace if he could keep Dhamar, Yarim, Amran, Kawkaban, al-Tawilah and Hajjah.  Conclusion and Aftermath  In August 1906, an Ottoman Delegation arrived to the Imam, expressing the desire to re-open negotiations, to which the Imam reportedly responded with by stating his desire to end the bloodshed. Five years of negotiations ensued, and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Daan on 9 October 1911, which led to Yemen becoming a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. It was effective for 7 years, until the Imam of Yemen capitalized on the Ottoman collapse in World War I and created the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen on 30 October 1918.  Yemeni Rebellion of 1911  In early 1911, the Imam, frustrated by the lack of progress in the negotiations, began another revolt against the Ottomans. Armed rebel bands arrived in Sanaa on 12 January 1911, and soon took over the city. The rebellion collapsed near the end of April.

The species was first described in the Journal of the Malacological Society of Australia in 1869. A. gigantea is also known more commonly as the sea hare due to their posterior chemosensory tentacles resembling a hare's ear. A. gigantea is the largest known species in Australia of the opisthobranch genus. The species is known to have toxic effects on terrestrial organisms, particularly domestic dogs. Exposure to this species with dogs has been associated with the development of neurotoxicosis, with symptoms ranging from respiratory distress to tremors, muscle fasciculations, and seizures.  Distribution  Aplysia gigantea are commonly found near the southwestern corner of Western Australia, in soft sediment or reef environments. They are found in shallow water, ranging from 0-20m in depth. A. gigantea are most commonly witnessed from January to March, where beach strandings of this species can number in the hundreds. A. gigantea are found most often in waters that range from 13.1-23.2 °C. The species has not yet been assessed by the IUCN, and thus its conservation status remains unknown.  Description  A. gigantea are known to be able to grow up to 60 cm long, making it one of the largest species of sea hare in Australia. They are usually a dark brown or black color. Additionally, they are distinguished by large paradopia on their backs, which function as limbs allowing the sea hare to swim for short periods of time. The species also has scent and taste receptors known as rhinophores, located on the upper side of its head. These organs resemble a hare's ears and are responsible for its more colloquial name of sea hare. The sea hare's eyes are also located beneath the rhinosphores, and are able to sense light and shadow. Its gills, as well as an internal, calcified shell are located near the organism's heart. The shell itself is particularly fragile, and the paradopia serve a secondary function in both enclosing and protecting it. The adults of this species are also herbivorous in nature, with a diet that primarily consists of algae.  Defense  A. gigantea is able to produce ink and secretions from two main secretory glands that render it hidden or toxic to predators. When ingested by domestic dogs, several symptoms have been recorded, including respiratory issues, ptyalism, emesis, ataxia, and hyperaesthesia. It is suggested the diet of A. gigantea, consisting of organisms such as red algae, provides the molecules needed to create toxins.  Reproduction  A. gigantea mate during summer and early autumn. A. gigantea are hermaphrodites and often mate in numbers ranging from 2 to approximately 20, producing orange colored spawn. In these mating groups, one individual will utilize only female or male reproductive organs respectively, while other participants use both. The eggs produced by A. gigantea are in long and stringy clumps, and hatch into planktonic larvae which feed on microscopic algae.

Il sacro di Fusi e il segno di Sarra, critique of the exhibition Segno Senso Suono Sacro: installazioni di Mario Airò – Federico Fusi – Sergio Sarra, curated by Zerynthia Associazione per l'Arte Contemporanea, Serre di Rapolano (Siena), Centro Civico per l'Arte Contemporanea La Grancia and Musei Senesi, May – June 1997.

Upon completing his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di BolognaIn 1986, Sarra has collaborated in the realization of the Wall Drawing 462 by Sol LeWitt at Galleria Studio G7 in Bologna. (1987), Sarra then moved to Rome where he held his first solo exhibition at the Galleria Alice in 1990, presenting an installation consisting of four painted sheets of glass and crossed by white light from industrial neon tubes. Such works – being glass – on which Sarra drew symbolic and enigmatic figures, went on to become a constant in his work. In this sense, two solo exhibitions – Trinacria dreamSergio Sarra: Trinacria dream, MCO Arte Contemporânea, Oporto, March – April 2007. (Oporto – 2007) and un ambiente, sei vetriSergio Sarra: un ambiente, sei vetri, Rome, Conservatory of Santa Cecilia, May – June 2013. (Rome – 2013) – appear indicative. In occasion of the exhibition in Portugal, art critic Miguel Amado wrote: Over the next few years, he produced a series of paintings on emulsified canvasThe surface treated with gel to render the surface photosensitive and permitting the reproduction of images on the canvas via a procedure similar to that of traditional photographic printing. Subsequently, the pictorial process thus becomes less detached. Sarra then painted the images reproduced in transparent red ink. Cf.

In Une correspondance sur les fantômes avec Sergio SarraEnglish translate: A correspondence on ghosts with Sergio Sarra. between Sarra e Nicolas Bourriaud in May 2007, the French critic and theorist wrote: In 2000 in Rome, his works were exhibited at the Fondazione Volume!.Fondazione Volume! website. In the same year, Sarra curated at Palazzo Chigi Odescalchi the group exhibition Conversione di Saulo that was developed around the painting of the same name, painted in 1600 by Caravaggio. Also in 2000, Sarra married Elisabetta Ruscitti in Amalfi, with whom he lived for a short time in Naples. In 2001, their son Gerolamo Papik Merlino was born. It was in Naples that he produced Table Sculpture (table projection on 12 points),Sergio Sarra – Works, sergiosarra.it. a table/sculpture with a huge red Komodo dragon hooked underneath. Over the same period, he produced the performance Life drawing no. 2, representing the connection between the manual creation and collective fruition – English version: \\"Anomalous Hotel\\", in Literature, sergiosarra.it. in which Sarra coerces the public's perceptive nature, using a strobe light to produce a decisive intermittence between darkness and light. This is the same direction in which Sarra heads when painting 'from real life' inside the WAX Kultúrgyár in Budapest and the Muzeul Naţional de Artă Contemporană in Bucharest for the exhibition Altered States – Are you Experienced?Altered States – Are you experienced?, Fuori Uso 2006, curated by Nicolas Bourriaud, Paolo Falcone, former COFA Pescara, December 2006 – February 2007 / WAX Winkler Art Xperience (former MEO), Budapest, May – June 2007 / Muzeul Naţional de Artă Contemporană (MNAC), Bucharest, June – August 2007 / Galeria Nouă, Bucharest, June – August 2007. (2006–2007). Between 2006 and 2009, Sarra worked on a series of paintings entitled Psichedelyc garden, in which he reiterates the same design, altering the chromatic impact each time. In 2011, Sarra published perché la spiaggia si assottiglia dopo le Nàiadi,English translate: why the beach becomes narrower after the Naìadi. a book in which he collates a series of drawings and writings focused on the city of Pescara. In 2012 he designed Handrail for Cubist Films, inspired by Fernand Léger's 1924 film Ballet Mécanique, and the diptych Involuntary Commitment which was exhibited at Galleria Cesare Manzo in Rome and at Fuori Uso 2012 in Pescara. In June 2016, Sarra was invited to exhibit at the Ewha Womans University in Seoul, where he presented a series of drawings and paintings entitled iceberg rosaspina, accompanied by a short text written by the artist: Traces of the theoretical processes underlying his works can be found in the short film My Painting Technique (2009, 2015).

The sneak peek was successful enough to warrant the show remaining on Nickelodeon's schedule whilst also airing on Nicktoons. Episode premieres continued on the main network on February 10 with the episodes \\"The Green-Eyed Monster\\" and \\"Rainbow Butterfly Unicorn Cupid.\\" During this temporary switch from Nicktoons to Nickelodeon, only the acronym for the show, RBUK, is used which differed from how the show was mentioned and displayed on promos, advertisements, most TV guides, and the theme song which was cut from all broadcasts. The series returned to Nicktoons on June 21, 2019, starting with the episode \\"The Trouble with Travis\\", and premiering all segments on separate days. Jetpack Distribution announced that it acquired international distribution rights in Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding Italy and Russia), Australasia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The series premiered on Nickelodeon's international channels and branded blocks following the U.S. launch later in 2019. In Canada, the series debuted on Family Channel on September 2, 2019. The series premiered January 1, 2020 on eToonz in South Africa. Reception Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series 2 out of 5 stars; saying that, “Felicity's unique nature makes her a decent example of embracing uniqueness in yourself and in others, but the show's frantic pace and distracting visuals tend to overshadow this positive quality.” Merchandise The upcoming toy line for the series by Funrise Toys is planned to cover many categories such as figurines, playsets, bobble heads, plush and dress-up. In February 2019, there was a preview of new toys from Funrise at the New York Toy Fair. The toys were released at Walmart on July 1, 2019.

Early life Clarke was the eldest son of Sir Edward Clarke of St. Vedast's, London, Lord Mayor of London, and his second wife Jane Clutterbuck, daughter of Richard Clutterbuck. He was admitted at St Catharine's College, Cambridge on 20 March 1689 and at Middle Temple on 17 March 1690. He married Elizabeth Pinfold, daughter of Alexander Pinfold of Hoxton, Middlesex on. 9 January 1699. Clarke may be the ‘Thomas Clerk’ who was named with his brother-in-law, Maynard Colchester as one of the founding members of the Society of the Propagation of the Gospel in 1701. They had both been educated at the Middle Temple and shared an interest in landscape gardening. In 1703 he succeeded his father to Brickendon, and assumed the role of a county country gentleman. In 1704 he became Freeman of Hertford. He carried out charitable works in his neighbourhood among which he ‘built a gallery in the church, set up chimes in the steeple, put 90 poor children to school, gave bibles, catechisms etc, and distributed half-peck loaves and two oxen among the poor at Christmas’. Career Clarke probably met William Cowper, at Middle Temple. Soon after coming of age he stood for Parliament at Hertford at the 1705 general election on the Cowper interest. Though defeated in the poll, he petitioned and was seated as a Whig Member of Parliament on 6 December 1705. In the House, he supported the Government, in February 1706, on the ‘place clause’ of the regency bill but made little other impression in the House. After presenting an address from his borough congratulating the Queen on the Duke of Marlborough's victory, he was knighted on 24 July 1706. He was called to the bar in 1706 and became an practicing lawyer. He was re-elected MP for Hertford at the 1708 general election and was appointed Commissioner for Charitable Uses at Hertford. He was listed as a Whig, and during the 1708 Parliament he followed the party line, supporting the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709. He was a teller for committing the bill for restraining buildings on new foundations on 10 March 1709 and voted for the impeachment of Sacheverell in 1710. He was defeated by the resurgent Tory interest at the 1710 general election and again in 1713. Clarke regained his seat at Hertford after the Hanoverian succession. At the 1715 general election he was again defeated in the poll but seated on petition on 24 May 1715. He generally acted with the government. For the third time at the 1722 general election he was defeated at the poll and seated on petition on 22 January 1723. In 1723 he became a bencher of his Inn. He was returned unopposed at the 1727 general election. He supported the Government, except on the civil list arrears in 1729 and on the later stages of the excise bill, having originally voted for it. In 1731 he became Treasurer of his Inn. He was returned unopposed for Hertford again in 1734 but retired at the 1741 general election. Death and legacy Clarke died without issue on 26 October 1754, and left his estate to his niece Jane Morgan, wife of Thomas Morgan of Ruperra, Glamorgan.

The church is dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia. Its construction is dated to 1706. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1958. History The first Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification was built in the 17th century. It was a simple church of mud and straw construction built by the Franciscans in the 17th century; its first mass is dated to October 18, 1700, the celebration day of Saint Lucas. Construction of the present structure began in 1706. José de Barros, vicar of the church, described the state of construction of the church in 1727. The Parish Church was fully walled and plastered by 1727. The tribunes, which originally rested on arches, were walled in. The Portuguese Crown donated 6,000 cruzados for the construction of the retable in 1729. A inspection of the church in 1730 revealed that the roof, ceilings, carvings, and altarpiece were in poor condition. By 1757 the chancel was increased by 27 palmos, or approximately . The size of the church by this period was compared to the Parish Church of Saint Bartholomew in Maragogipe. The architecture style of the church reflects its long period of construction, ranging from the Baroque of the early 18th century to the Neoclassical of the late 18th century. A crack, three fingers wide, was found in one of the bell towers in 1828, but was not considered serious. The first repairs of the church were carried out in 1921. Plaques on the frontispiece of the church indicate that the exterior and chancel were repaired between 1925 and 1926. Location The Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification is located at the north-western end of the Praça da Purificação, a public square. It sits a block above the Subaé River opposite the Town Hall of Santo Amaro. Structure Painting of the nave ceiling The Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification is constructed of lime and stone masonry. The church covers , is high, and has two stories. The façade has three portals, a monumental pediment, and is flanked by bell towers on both sides. The church was once surrounded by an iron railing, but now has a broad, circular staircase that surrounds the front and sides of the building. The portals are in lioz limestone imported from Portugal in the style of a triumphal arch, similar to that found in the parish church in Maragogipe. Three windows at the choir level, with two windows at the same level in the bell towers. The windows of the bell tower have oculi below. The pediment has volutes and central niche with an image of Our Lady of Purification. The bell towers have small clocks blow the bell gable, a feature also found in the bell towers of the Church and Convent of Saint Antony and Chapel of the Third Order in São Francisco do Conde. The belfries have pyramid pediments covered by blue and white azulejos, a feature found in other churches in Salvador and the Recôncavo region. The bell tower pediments are surrounded by four ceramic flame urns, also with blue tiles. The gabled roof is supported by wood supports. =Interior= The first floor consists of a single nave with a transept. The church has an elaborate chancel and altar, and side altars. It has two sacristies at the rear of the first church, with one now used as a meeting room. The nave is spacious, with a large-scale vaulted, painted ceiling of wood. There are additional paintings along the walls of the nave and above the side altars, and numerous azulejos. The paintings of the ceilings of the transept have Biblical scenes. The second story has a choir above the entrance, lateral tribunes, and consistories above the sacristies on the first floor. One lateral corridor was transformed into side chapels. The choir is supported by two smooth marble columns. An stone arch under the choir opens to a bapistery with a stone font.

Her first novel, The Earth Hums in B Flat (Canongate, 2009), works on one level as a detective story, while on another dealing with the problems of growing up in a small Welsh village in the 1950s, and more generally with the influence of the past on the present. Personal life Mari Strachan was raised in a Welsh-speaking family in North-West Wales. Her father was a bricklayer and stonemason, while her mother, who had left school at 14, cleaned for a living. After leaving the Welsh-medium secondary school Ysgol Ardudwy in Harlech, she graduated in history and English from Cardiff University and then qualified as a chartered librarian, working as such until her retirement. She was 61 when her first novel appeared. Strachan and her husband live on a smallholding in Ceredigion, West Wales. She says her children were \\"quite excited\\" by her success, and one of her grandchildren, credited at the front of her first novel, was delighted to see his name alongside its many translated languages. \\"I always write in English because I was educated in English although my first language is Welsh,\\" she told an interviewer. \\"I find it very hard to write for adults in Welsh. I don't feel it's accurate enough. There is still a gap between spoken and written Welsh.\\" Novels Encouragement to take up novel-writing in retirement came from a Masters' Course at Manchester Metropolitan University, which \\"made me focus on my own writing\\" rather than \\"trying to imitate other writers whose books I admired.\\" The 11-year-old protagonist Gwenni of The Earth Hums in B Flat, Strachan's first book, \\"is not based on a real person.... Sometimes I think that maybe she's the child I wish I had been. I grew up in the 1950s... and was taught that it was impolite to contradict or argue with anyone. Gwenni is not afraid to ask questions even when she knows it'll cause trouble for her, and she's not afraid to do what she believes is the right thing.\\" Translation rights to it have been sold for at least twelve languages. American rights have also been sold, to Grove Atlantic. The Guardian noted in a review of it her \\"deft handling of a dark subject... both sober and sparkling.\\" It was read as the BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime in April 2009, while being chosen for Waterstones' New Voices and winning an Amazon Rising Star award the same spring. Its Scottish publisher Canongate Books issued her second novel, Blow on a Dead Man's Embers, in 2011. (An edition in 2012 appeared as Dead Man's Embers.) It owes something to her grandfather's experience of shell shock in telling of a traumatised Welsh First World War returnee from the armed forces and his family, in \\"a distinctive and potent treatment\\" of the \\"lingering sorrow of war\\", according to The Times Literary Supplement.

History Allenswood House was located on a large tract of land between Albert Drive and Wimbledon Park Road, in Southfields in the London Borough of Wandsworth, England. It was owned by Henry Hansler and was built in the Tudor Revival style between 1865 and 1870. The house was converted in 1870 by Marie Souvestre and her partner, Paolina Samaïa, into a boarding school for girls. The school, whose students were primarily from the European aristocracy and American upper-class, provided a progressive education to its students. Often called a finishing school, Allenswood had a curriculum that included serious study at a time when education was denied to women, and stressed feminist ideals of social responsibility and personal independence. In addition to learning French, which was the official language spoken at the school, students studied the arts, dance, history, language (English, German, and Italian), literature, music, and philosophy and were required to develop their own analytical skills to assess ideals and challenges. When Souvestre died in 1905, Samaïa became the headmistress until 1909. She was succeeded by Florence Boyce and then in 1916, by Helen Gifford, one of Eleanor Roosevelt's classmates and Jeanne Dozat. Gifford and Dozat served as co-principals until 1922, when Gifford left to establish Benfleet Hall, a school based on Souvestre's model, in Benhill, Surrey. Dozat was later joined by Enid Michell, who remained as headmistress until the school closed in 1950. Redevelopment In 1950, the London County Council and Wandsworth London Borough Council took possession of the site under eminent domain to develop the Wimbledon Park Estate. The school was demolished and a housing development, known as Allenswood Estate, was created on the site.

Preparation and reactions Ethyl vinyl ether is made by reaction of acetylene and ethanol in presence of a base. The alkene portion of the molecule is reactive in many ways. It is prone to polymerization, leading to formation of polyvinyl ethers. Polymerization is typically initiated with Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride. Ethyl vinyl ether participates in many reactions of interest to organic synthesis.

Biography According to his confession, Walton was born in Wilkes County near a town called Pistol (alternative name for Delhi), and his first crime ever was killing a horse in 1890. Six years later, he murdered and then robbed a man in Blossburg, Alabama. Later police investigations couldn't confirm that there was ever such a crime, and Walton was never even sought after. While in Joliet, Illinois in 1902, he married his future victim, Edith Hanna, but they were quickly separated for about two years. In August 1904, Walton had asked her to come back to him, but when she refused, he traveled to her Chicago address of No. 81 South Peoria Street and then shot her. Hanna died 3 days later, without regaining consciousness. By then, Walton had fled and yet again avoided arrest. He then attacked an unnamed man in Joliet, who apparently had connections to Hanna, but the unnamed victim had survived. Since everybody who knew him and Hanna in Chicago was clearly aware that he had killed her, Walton fled, but not before considering informing the police department of Chicago. The police did investigate Hanna's murder, even questioning the current family that lived at the address, but neither they, nor the authorities were certain that Walton was the husband who had murdered the woman. Under the name of \\"Frank Harris\\", Walton traveled to Raton, New Mexico, but fearing that he might be recognized or caught, he changed course and went to Gallup, taking the name of \\"Frank Johnson\\". In 1906, he had helped rob a stranger in Youngstown, Ohio. In July of the same year, while passing through Shippenville, Pennsylvania, Walton had learned that a man called Marion Blue and a couple of other men had planned to rob him. When said man crossed him on the road, Walton shot at him three to four times, fearing that he might draw first. Blue died several months after said shooting. Travelling on to Steubenville, Ohio, Walton met with a woman named Mamie Gill, from Roanoke, Virginia. Pretending to be married, the pair lodged at the house of a Mrs. Brown at 132 South Seventh Street in Steubenville. He then took the woman for a ride-along to a place called \\"Crow Hollow\\", where he was expecting some sort of payday. The pair stayed there for 3–4 days, accompanied by another man whom Gill had lived with before. On the night between November 16 and 17, Walton and Gill had quarreled all day, and in a fit of jealousy, the woman was beaten by the huge man. That same night, after returning home from a walk, the pair began to fight yet again. A few miles before their residence, Walton knocked the woman down and then proceeded to beat and kick her. According to his confession, he had worn a heavy pair of shoes on that day, and when he accidentally kicked her in the heart, she died. Realising what he had done, Walton then proceeded to carry her on his back for about half a mile before hiding the body in some bushes along the river bank. The body was then supposedly washed away by the waters, and the panicking Walton soon fled the country for a while. =Murder of Beulah Martin and capture= After killing Beulah Martin on March 3, 1908 in Gypsy, West Virginia for refusing to have sex with him, Walton was chased after by a posse of around 400 people, running to the nearby hills. He soon found himself barricaded in a barn, defending himself from the angry mob for two days and seriously injuring three people. However, he immediately surrendered when Sheriff Flanagan threatened him that he would blow up the barn. Execution After being sentenced to death for killing Martin, Walton proceeded to confess to his previous murders and crimes as well. Shortly before his execution date, he was baptized in jail and seemed remorseful for his deeds. On the day of his execution, despite his gigantic stature and cool demeanour, Walton had to be supported by Capt. Joseph Bloyd and Warden Dawson because of his shaky feet. Although nearly expressionless, reporters present noticed that the prisoner was definitely anguished and troubled because of the look in his eyes. Shortly after Reverend Sanford concluded the prayer offered to the condemned man, Warden Dawson pressed the button and the trap doors opened. Walton's death was painless, as he had fallen into unconsciousness before the rope was stretched, even though his neck and one of his vertebraes were broken in the process. After the present medical professional, Dr. Boone, made sure that the man was dead, his body was carried away by two convicts to be prepared for burial. It is presumed that Walton's body was buried in the prison cemetery.

Malory based her on a nameless character from the earlier Prose Tristan, who was named as Elergia in the Italian La Tavola Ritonda.  Annowre  As told by Thomas Malory, Lady Annowre was a great sorceress from North Wales (Norgalles). She fell in love with King Arthur and tried to seduce him when he came to Cardiff. But when Anmowre found out she could not get Arthur to lie down with her even by the means of magic, as he would always remain faithful to Guinevere no matter what, and so she instead began plotting his death. Annowre entices Arthur to her tower in the heart of the Perilous Forest (Forest Perilous), where every day he is forced to fight for his life. The Lady of the Lake, Nimue (Nineve, Nyneve, etc.), learns of this peril. She finds the mighty hero Tristan (Tristram) and brings him to the tower where they arrive just in time to see two knights defeat Arthur. As Annowre is about to decapitate the king with his own sword, Tristan rushes in and kills her knights. Nimue shouts to Arthur not to let Annowre escape, and the king chases down the sorceress and beheads her with the same sword (in some versions, it is Tristan who cuts her head off). Nimue then hangs Annowre's head by the hair to her saddle as a symbol of victory. Alan S. Kaufman connected Nimue's taking Annowre head to the classical legend of Medusa, whose head was taken as a trophy by Athena. According to Loreto Todd, \\"Annowre may be related to Aneurin, which is thought to come from Latin honorius; Annowre would thus mean 'honoured woman'.\\" Patricia Monaghan considered Annowre possibly the double for Morgan. Lucy Allen Paton theorized that Annowre's name might have been related to Morgain (Morgan) and Anna, noting the similarity of the episode with that of the plot of Accolon and suggesting both of them had common origin in an early but now-lost story where Morgan took Arthur with magic and then tried to destroy him after being rejected.  Elergia  According to Carolyne Larrington, Malory's Annowre is the same character as Elergia from La Tavola Ritonda, who herself is \\"an elaboration of the anonymous sorceress in some Tristan en Prose MSS. (Löseth S74a).\\" In Tavola Ritonda, Lady Elergia (dama Elergia) is the young and lustful daughter of Lady Escorducarla of Avalon (Vallone, here an isle in the \\"Sea of Soriano\\"). Escorducarla, who seems to be the same character as the \\"Dame d'Avalon\\" in the Prophecies de Merlin, has the marvelous castle of Great Desire (Grande Disio) created for Elergia to dwell in a dark and dangerous valley within the Forest of Darnantes (Andernantes) near Camelot. According to an analysis of the castle's symbolism by Donald L. Hoffman, it \\"is a monument to lust and rampant discordia, a temporary paradise destined to fall when only truth and true love will stand\\" for Tristan and Iseult in the afterlife, \\"united in the eternity\\". Unlike Mallory's Annowre, Elergia succeeds in possessing Arthur's mind and body. She finds the king in the forest and slips an enchanted ring on his finger, causing him to fall in love with her and forget about Guinevere and everything else in the world. More than three months later, the Lady of the Lake finally breaks the spell, sending of one her damsels to find Tristan (Tristano) and help Arthur escape. The damsel and Tristan find the Great Desire, decorated with an imagery of orgies, and by chance come upon Elergia herself with her four brothers in front of the castle just as the sorceress orders them to kill the escaping Arthur. The four knights are no match for Tristan, who swiftly slays them all. Elergia tries to flee to her castle and the Lady's damsel tells Tristan to capture her, who does it and drags Elergia by her hair before Arthur. The king, \\"thinking of the evil that this damsel could do to others\\", takes his sword and smites her head off, which is then taken by the Lady's damsel to Camelot. Tristan is at first shocked by Arthur's deed, believing such a violent act against a maiden is unfitting a good king, but eventually agrees with him after listening to his story. In the original version from Old French Prose Tristan, the episode has some differences. Like in the later variants, Arthur is saved at the last moment. Here, Tristan seizes an unnamed young woman after killing one of the two knights with her and wounding the other, and the freed Arthur immediately cuts off her head and finishes off the wounded knight. The King then explains how she had come to his court and offered to lead him to the knight named Saliel who had murdered one of his relatives. But after this done, she had led him to her tower and had him bewitched with a ring placed on his finger. One day, a damsel of the Lady of the Lake arrived and removed the spell, urging Arthur to take the head of the enchantress. But when Arthur attempted this, the sorceress called her two brothers, who were about to kill him when Tristan appeared just in time.https://dokumen.pub/the-romance-of-tristan-the- thirteenth-century-old-french-prose-tristan-9780192827920.html In the Tavola Ritonda, Arthur then tries to have Elergia's castle razed, but finds out it cannot be pulled down; according to Merlin's prophecy, as such a sinful place, that castle would stand until the end of the world, the fall of its great central tower signaling the apocalypse. Elergia's mother, who in her grief becomes the \\"saddest woman in the world\\", later obsessively plots revenge on Arthur and all the wandering knights. Escorducarla sends her lover Sir Lasancis (messer Lasancis) with an enchanted lance to trap and burn Tristan, Arthur, and the others in order to avenge her daughter's death, but Tristan defeats him. The tale of Lasancis is also told in the eponymous poem Cantare di Lasancis.  In modern culture  Annowre appears in Clemence Housman's 1905 novel The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis, in which Sir Durnor sends her to enchant and have her way with Aglovale, who spends a hard night with \\"the whore Annowre\\" against his will; later, Percivale tells the news of \\"King Arthur's coming to Cardiff on adventure, and of his ending of the wicked Annowre.\\" Nimue mentions her saving of Arthur from \\"that poor, love-crazed enchantress Annowre\\" in Phyllis Ann Karr's 1982 novel The Idylls of the Queen: A Tale of Queen Guenevere, in which Morgan also mentions Annowre among her \\"old cohorts\\".

For much of his life, Shepard was an accomplished confidence trickster and used a variety of stage names and pseudonyms, primarily to evade his creditors and break the terms of his recording contracts. Early life Shepard was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. As a teenager, he began his career as a radio performer on WPTF and WBT. In the late 1940s, he joined the cast of Hayloft Hoedown, a radio show produced in Philadelphia. During this period, his recordings were issued on several labels, including Musicraft, King, and Majestic. Encyclopedia of Traditional Music and Folk Songs In the 1960s, Shepard relocated to California, and embarked upon a decades-long project to develop a comprehensive encyclopedia of folk music. By 1976, he had single-handedly catalogued and coded more than 43,000 folk songs, along with their derivative works and variant lyrics. His comprehensive cross-referencing scheme demonstrated that the 43,000 titles originate from just 4,000 songs, texts and tunes. Despite several attempts, Shepard failed to find a publisher for the encyclopedia, but he continued collecting and categorizing the material. After his death in 2009, the manuscripts were stored by an early investor in Porterville, California, and later Shepard's work, including research books and other materials, were stored by a friend of one of the investors, who gave it to Shepard's daughter, Stacya Silverman in 2019. Stacya Silverman was contacted by Internet Archives, and the work is now available online. Portions of the material are also held at the Library of Congress.

Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of Team Downey. On August 25, 2017, it was announced that Pizzolatto had dropped out of the production in order to focus on the third season of True Detective and that he was being replaced as the project's writer by Rolin Jones and Ron Fitzgerald. The HBO revival and reboot adapted its setting to Great Depression-era Los Angeles, some twenty years earlier than the CBS show (but in line with the earliest novels by Gardner). On January 14, 2019, it was announced that HBO had given the production an order as a limited series. It was further announced that Jones, Fitzgerald, Susan Downey, and Amanda Burrell would serve as additional executive producers, that Matthew Rhys would serve as a producer, and that the production was in the process of hiring a director. Jones and Fitzgerald serve as showrunners for the series as well. In March, Tim Van Patten was announced as director and executive producer. On July 22, 2020, it was revealed HBO had decided to turn Perry Mason into a regular series, renewing it for a second season. =Casting= Alongside the initial development announcement, it was confirmed that Robert Downey Jr. would star as the titular Perry Mason. On July 25, 2018, it was reported that Downey had dropped out of the role due to his feature film schedule and that a search for his replacement was ongoing. On January 14, 2019, it was announced that Matthew Rhys had been cast to replace Downey. Tatiana Maslany joined in April. John Lithgow was added to the cast in May. In June, Chris Chalk and Shea Whigham were cast in lead roles, with Nate Corddry, Veronica Falcón, Jefferson Mays, Gayle Rankin and Lili Taylor set in recurring roles. Juliet Rylance, Andrew Howard, Eric Lange, Robert Patrick and Stephen Root joined in July. Justin Kirk would be added in October. Reception =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, season one holds an approval rating of 77% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Brimming with top notch performances and dripping in style, Perry Masons compelling mystery more than makes up for its somewhat messy story.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Ben Travers of IndieWire said that season one is \\"built with confidence, patience, and a voice calibrated for today's audiences\\" and gave it a \\"B+\\", writing: \\"Perry Mason stands as an astounding visual feat for its specific framings as well as its overall world-building. There are striking images of a pitch-black profile and lavish outdoor shots of real Los Angeles locations. In some shows, intimate conversations between two people can clash with the grander scenes... Mason has the intuition (and the budget) to not just balance visual opulence with smaller, private moments, but to blend them.\\" =Ratings= With 1.7 million viewers across all platforms, more than Watchmen (1.5 million) and The Outsider (1.2 million), the debut of Perry Mason was the strongest of any HBO series for two years.

They are led by Penn Badgley, formerly of Gossip Girl fame.  History  Producer Jimmy Giannopoulos (Lolawolf, Reputante) and vocalist Penn Badgley, neighborhood friends for years in New York, waited patiently for a sound to manifest beyond their bond based upon an odd pop aesthetic. Bassist Darren Will (Rathborne) was always orbiting, always an obvious partner when the time came. The three finally decided to hole up in a little bungalow in East LA to record for eight days without anything written, without expectation. Seeking a microphone, they found in the neighborhood one-time- Brooklynite and New Zealand expat Simon Oscroft (No), who proved to be the guitarist they weren't looking for. The spontaneous quartet recorded five songs in five days before taking a breath to see they had, in fact, started a band. In early 2014, they released a song titled \\"Easy\\" on SoundCloud under the name M O T H E R; the song quickly gained popularity and was posted on numerous blogs. Months later, the band changed the spelling of their name to MOTHXR, citing a cease-and-desist from another band with a similar name. In 2015, the band signed with the labels Kitsuné and Washington Square Music, the New York City-based subdivision of the Razor & Tie label.

Ethiopia is the 16th highest nation in the world for child marriage.  Causes  Although other countries have taken efforts to end child marriage by establishing new laws that criminalize the practice, such preventative actions have not occurred in Ethiopia because of its semi- organized system on child marriage. Some of the main reasons why Ethiopia continues to allow child marriage practices is due to religious beliefs, traditional norms, lack of education, and economic relianc while technically still being illegal. Ethiopia is just another example of a developing country in which extreme poverty leads to child marriages. Originally, child marriage was a custom that occurred between two wealthy families. Rich people were attracted to early marriage as a way to establish an alliance with two strong households in order to ensure land and cattle for their offspring. Nonetheless, this trend gradually decreased with the loss of resources in rural Ethiopia and the increase of poverty. The financial struggle that families often find themselves with is not in their control. Several families are forced into poverty because of the loss of a parent. It has been discovered that one in five out of the total of 3,000 Ethiopian children have been orphaned of at least one parent. There is also the possibility that the child is from a drought-stricken rural area, these communities tend to have higher poverty rates which directly increase the child marriage rates. One of the biggest arguments as to why child marriage still occurs in Ethiopia is because of its presence in history and traditional practices often seen in rural Ethiopia. It is important to understand that since child marriage has been around since the beginning of Ethiopian civilization it has become normalized in rural society, even encouraged. In 2001, UNICEF reported that some parents prefer to give away their daughters at a young age as a protective measure. Young girls in Ethiopia are constantly faced with the reality of being abducted, raped, and having unwanted pregnancies. So much so that parents feel more comfortable allowing their child to enter a legitimate marriage where her husband can serve as a protector. Extramarital sex is one of the biggest things that parents try to prevent with their daughters. Reasons for this include sexually transmitted diseases and risk of pregnancy but the main reason is in order to protect the honor of the girl and her family. It is because of this that a common belief is that if girls were married before they reached puberty and hit sexual maturity they are less likely to be promiscuous. Child marriage is actually considered the preferred preventive method compared to more drastic practices such as female genital mutilation. This fear is only validated by the continued practice of a tradition that allows men to abduct girls and force them to become their bride. This act commonly known as bride napping is seen in several developing countries but is especially prevalent in the countryside of Ethiopia. Often when men are too poor to afford a dowry they simply kidnap the bride of their choice and force her into marriage. Men usually gather their friends and ride on horseback to go and collect their future wives while they walk home from grade school. Once they have successfully obtained the girl the husband to be takes the liberty of raping his young wife and claiming her as his own. This is seen as a form of courtship because once a girl has lost her virginity in Ethiopian culture she is seen as impure and tainted for other men. This abduction process is overseen by the local council of elders who have final say in most matters and tend to agree with abduction practices, basing their decisions on tradition and culture. Ethiopian culture contains several groups of thought that promote the occurrence of child marriage such as the idea that “a girl who is not married by late adolescence represents a failure and disgrace to the family. In particular, the status of the girl's father is compromised, and he is considered a failure when his daughter remains unmarried into her late teens”. The emphasis on family, honor, and purity are all themes in Ethiopian culture that heavily influence societal opinions and practices. Religion is yet another large component as to why child marriage is a remaining custom in rural Ethiopia. Acceptance of child marriage is majorly seen in the Ethiopian Muslim community. Muslims who support child marriage claim that their religion and the Shariah allows girls to marry at a young age.

Early life and family  Vernon was born on August 11, 1920, in Krakow, Poland, to General Bolesław and Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska.. Born the day before the Battle of Warsaw, her godfather was Józef Piłsudski. She was an only child. She studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London in 1939-1940. In early 1940 her father, then Polish Ambassador to the Italian government in Rome, summoned her back to Rome. When Italy joined the war on the Axis side in June 1940, she went with her parents into exile in the USA.  Career  After trying a number of jobs during the war, including working as an editorial assistant to Alexander Liberman at Vogue (magazine), she joined the United Nations in late 1946 as one of the first simultaneous interpreters. Simultaneous interpretation was established at the UN by Colonel Léon Dostert, who had pioneered the technique at the Nuremberg trials. She worked initially translating from Spanish and French into English, but her letters show she was soon interpreting in both directions between English and French. During the second part of the first General Assembly of the United Nations, she was spending ten and a half hours at the microphone six days a week, in marked contrast to today’s norms. In 1948 she was transferred to the UN in Geneva, where her languages included Russian. In 1949 she married John Vernon, an Englishman who had a career as an international civil servant. Her first child, Catherine, was born in 1950. In 1952, she left the UN and worked freelance, but returned to full time work at the OECD (1958-1969), then NATO in Brussels and finally, until she retired in 1982, at the EU in Brussels. Vernon was a founding member of the International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) and a friend from childhood of another pioneer simultaneous interpreter and later secretary of AIIC, . She retired with her husband John to London and died there in 2011.

It was produced by Gene and Billy Page, who had previously worked with Wilson on All in Love Is Fair (1974) and Come Get to This (1975). Gene Page also served as arranger and conductor for most songs. Garry Sherman produced and arranged four songs. As with most of Wilson's albums from the 1970s, I've Never Been to Me features more of an R&B; and soul music sound. Reception Upon the album's initial release in 1977, Stereo Review featured it in their \\"Recordings of Special Merit Best of the Month\\" section, stating, \\"Nancy Wilson has finally become herself, and the lady is simply dynamite. Her stunning performance of the title song here is probably the best thing she's done yet. It's a tough, world-weary, and worldly wise song. . . . Wilson sings it with an overriding tone of furious exasperation with herself and with all of life's unsatisfying surface pleasure.\\" They also praised her work on \\"Patience My Child\\" and \\"Love Is Alive.\\" The review concluded by saying, \\"Nancy Wilson has now joined that select bevy of ladies . . . Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Barbra Streisand, Carmen MacRae, and Mabel Mercer.\\" In July 1977, Billboard Magazine reviewed the album in its \\"Recommended LPs\\" section, saying, \\"The musicianship surrounding this singer is superior\\" and that the production is \\"equally impressive.\\" They added, however, that the \\"selection of material does not for the most part complement her rich vocal style.\\" They mentioned \\"All By Myself,\\" \\"Changes,\\" \\"Nobody,\\" and the title track as \\"Best Cuts.\\" More recently, Jason Ankeny at AllMusic praised Wilson's earlier work with producer-arranger Gene Page but said I've Never Been to Me was \\"undermined by overbaked, pop-inspired production and lackluster material,\\" with a \\"gauzy, sleepily mellow sound that's more tepid than sophisticated.\\" He did hail Wilson's version of the title song, saying she strips away \\"layers of camp to reveal the song's unflinching intimacy and emotional depth.\\" Reissues In 2012, SoulMusic Records released a digitally remastered version of I've Never Been to Me, paired with This Mother's Daughter, Wilson's previous album.

He obtained the degree of Doctor of Civil Law by 1406, when King Henry IV pardoned and approved a papal bull granting Hovyngham a canonry and prebend in each of the Cathedral churches of St Peter's, York and St Paul's, London, and a greater dignity in one or the other, provided that this did not extend to elective benefices.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, III: 1405–1408 (HMSO, London 1907), p. 109 (2 January 1406).

Archdeacon of Durham  In 1406, at the appointment of Thomas Langley as Bishop of Durham, Hovyngham was present as the advocate of the Court of Canterbury at Langley's nomination of Thomas Weston as Archdeacon of Durham.J.W. Kirby (ed.), The York Sede Vacante Register 1405–1408: a Calendar, Borthwick Texts and Calendars 28 (Borthwick Institute/University of York, 2002), p. 33 no. 258.

From references in Hovyngham's will to Kirkbymoorside, Byland Abbey and Skipwith, it seems possible that he is \\"John de Honyngham\\" the canon of St Mary's, Newburgh Priory (York diocese), who as perpetual vicar of \\"Kirby super moram\\" sought a papal indult in 1410–1411 to let to farm the fruits of the vicarage, when studying at university or living in some safe place. While living in the church he had been set upon by robbers, of whom there were many thereabouts, who had threatened him that unless he gave them money they would come back and kill him.'Lateran Regesta 159: 1411–1412', in W.H.

In June 1414 he was sent, together with Henry Lord Scrope of Masham, Thomas Chaucer, Hugh Mortimer and Philip Morgan, as proctors for King Henry in order to conclude a league, confederation and friendship with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, and to receive his homage as a vassal of the English king. They were to accept one of the Duke's daughters as a prospective spouse for Henry, as part of a perpetual alliance against the Dukes of Orléans and Bourbon. Hovingham himself made two separate journeys.Wylie, Reign of Henry the Fifth, I, pp. 413-16 and note 13, & p. 449 (Internet Archive). The great embassy was being conducted to Charles VI of France, with whom the Armagnac faction were making league, during the same months. On 24 November 1414 Archdeacon Hovyngham was presented by the prior and convent of Durham to the Prebend of Skipwith in the collegiate church of Howden in the York diocese.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry V, Vol. I: 1413–16, p. 332. \\"Register of the prior and convent of Durham from A.D. 1401\\", Durham Cathedral Archive: Register III, fol. 42r (GB-0033-DCD-Regr-3).

In August 1415 he was among the assessors over whom Archbishop Chichele presided, at the London inquisition against the Lollard John Claydon of St Anne's near Aldersgate, who was subsequently burned at West Smithfield.Wylie, The Reign of Henry the Fifth, I, pp. 285-92 (Internet Archive). Soon afterwards, as King Henry's preparations for the assault on France were in the final stages, Hovyngham was sent with Simon Flete as envoys to the Duke of Brittany to recruit his support, not returning until December of that year. The Duke brought out 6000 men, but was too slow in bringing them to Henry to be of service in his cause.Wylie, The Reign of Henry the Fifth, II, pp. 121-23 (Internet Archive).  Hovyngham's will  John Hovyngham died in 1417 leaving a lengthy Latin will dated 12 June.'Testamentum Magistri Johanni Hovyngham' (P.C.C. 1417, Marche quire 2B, images 154-56); long transcript (Latin) in J.W. Clay (ed.), North Country Wills, being abstracts of Wills... at Somerset House and Lambeth Palace, 1383 to 1558, Surtees Society Vol. CXVI (Bernard Quaritch, London 1908), pp. 15-20 (Internet Archive). He leaves his body to be buried in the conventual church of St Bartholomew, London, or at Easington parish church if he should die in the Durham diocese. He leaves money for a year's masses on his behalf at St Bartholomew's, and to Easington for a principal vestment and attire suitable for a deacon and subdeacon, for ordination there before their high altar, so that one chaplain shall have an annual pension of six marks to celebrate for him in the chantry which John Calcroft formerly occupied in the said church. Other churches mentioned include St Peter Westcheap, St Lawrence Jewry, St Mary-le-Bow and St Andrew Cornhill in London, Bishop Auckland, Elvet (Durham), Newton Archidiaconi, Walgrave (Northamptonshire), Sedlescombe (Sussex), Sulhamstead Abbots near Reading (Berkshire), the collegiate church of Wolverhampton, Skipwith, St Peter's York, St Mary de Stanyngham, Byland Abbey, and the shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury Cathedral. The will makes many individual bequests, and refers to his sister Agnes, and his half-brothers William and Robert and their mother Johanna, who according to their father's will are to hold and inherit his properties in York. Several London churches are remembered, including St Peter Westcheap and its chaplains. The will is particularly interesting for its mention of various books. He restores to Byland Abbey a book called Tabula iurisThus correctly in Shuffelton: mis-transcribed in North Country Wills. Presumably the Tabula iuris canonici et civilis of Johannes de Saxonia. which was lent to him by the late Abbot Geoffrey; he asks William Bryght, rector of St Michael Cornhill, to forgive him for having failed to return his book of Gorham. To one he gives his best Bible and a book of sermons which a certain prior of St Bartholomew's wrote (a paper volume),See discussion in R. Sharpe, 'John Eyton and the Sermones in Evangelia Dominicalia attributed to Philip Repyngham,' Medium Ævum LXXXIII no. 2 (2014), pp. 254-65. and to another the book Speculum Curatorum which he has already lent to him. He has a book of Gorham's Super Matthaeum, and a copy of Bartholomeus' De Casibus Consciencie. He gives his great Missal, recently bought from John Boyse, to the church of Easington; restores to John White, chaplain there, a small missal he has lent him, and to Richard Kelsterne at Westcheap his volume of Vegetius. The circulation of these books has encouraged the suggestion that Hovyngham maintained friendships from his days at Oxford University.Shuffelton, 'School Ties', p. 19. The will was proved before Bishop Philip Repyngdon at the Old Temple, London on 15 December 1417.

This work led to future post-war pioneering research in lung physiology, the effect of asbestos on the lungs and lung diseases including emphysema. Between 1952 and 1955, he took up a senior lecturer post at the then new University College of the West Indies and was the first to use the terminology of diabetes types 1, 2, and J in his 1955 paper for The Lancet titled \\"Diabetes in Jamaica\\". Upon return to the UK, he became a consultant at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, where he continued MRC research on lung gas analysis using a newly modified mass spectrometer. Later, he would go on to King's College Hospital, where he continued research on lung diseases and set up a chest unit. Early life Philip Morrell Hugh- Jones was born in London on 22 August 1917, the result of an affair between Philip Morrell, a Liberal Party politician who was married to Lady Ottoline Morrell, and Alice Louisa Jones who worked at The Nation. Both were associated with the Bloomsbury Group.Kings College, Cambridge. (2011) Annual Report 2011. Cambridge: Kings College, Cambridge. pp. 151–154.

Retrieved 16 January 2019. from where he went to King's College, University of Cambridge, where he took the natural sciences tripos, passing with a first. Career In 1942, Hugh-Jones gained his MB BChir and undertook his junior posts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Later in 1942, while he was working on his MD, he was appointed to the staff of the Medical Research Council (MRC) and was posted to Dorset to investigate the effects of gun fumes on tank operators. =Pneumoconiosis Research Unit (PRU)= Before 1930, coal dust was not considered harmful. In 1936, the rise in the incidence of silicosis among coal miners resulted in a request from the Home Office to the MRC to \\"investigate the incidence and characteristics of disabling pulmonary diseases affecting workers in coal mines and the conditions which give rise to them\\". The conclusion of the investigation, which used extensive Xrays, was that there was another disease, \\"pneumoconiosis of coal miners\\". After the Second World War, Hugh-Jones joined the newly set up Pneumoconiosis Research Unit (PRU) in Cardiff, South Wales. This unit first described two types of the lung disease pneumoconiosis (the two-disease hypothesis) in which the progress of the disease was halted in one group of patients (those with early disease) by removing them from the source of coal dust. Where the disease was progressive however, the lung damage would continue to develop however far they went from the source of the coal dust. The resulting increase in unemployment from taking men out of work due to early disease, led Hugh-Jones to publish \\"the social consequences of pneumoconiosis\\" in 1951. This work, co-authored with Charles M. Fletcher, reported that \\"at present some 5,000 men with pneumoconiosis, three-quarters of whom are probably capable of work under normal industrial conditions, are unemployed.\\" He later recounted a visit by Nobel laureate Edward Purcell. Both being interested in gas analysis, they proposed using a mass spectrometer to investigate lung gases. However, the equipment needed redesigning in order to function in people. =Diabetes in Jamaica= University of the West Indies Mona Campus, Jamaica Following a successful application for a post as senior lecturer at the then new University College of the West Indies, advertised in the British Medical Journal in 1952, he moved with his family to Jamaica. With respiratory disease of less interest in Jamaica, he focused his attention on diabetes, a disease traditionally thought of as one disease on a spectrum. However, a need for a classification had been noted by the French researchers Apollinaire Bouchardat and E. Lancereux between 1850 and 1875. They distinguished between those diabetics that were lean, had severe symptoms, a poor prognosis and pancreatic lesions at autopsy (diabetes maigre), and those that were overweight, presented later in life with a milder form of the disease and had a better prognosis if put on a low calorie diet (diabetes gras). Their theories were largely forgotten by the early twentieth century however, when diabetes was seen as a disease on a spectrum that was explained by reference to age of onset and severity. In 1950, R. D. Lawrence reported that diabetics were of two types, those who were not deficient in insulin and those who were. Subsequently, in 1955, Hugh-Jones published an article in The Lancet titled \\"Diabetes in Jamaica\\", in which he clarified Lawrence’s explanation of the two types of diabetes using the terminology of type 1 and type 2. Hugh-Jones reported that 6% of the 215 diabetics attending the University College Hospital of the West Indies could not be classified as either type 1 or 2. They were young and underweight at the onset of their illness, but were resistant to insulin. If their diabetic control deteriorated, unlike in type 1 diabetes, the profound glycosuria was not accompanied with ketosis. He called this third type, type J, where J stood for Jamaica. Malnutrition was a key feature. It was later given various names including protein-deficient pancreatic diabetes, atypical diabetes and type 1B diabetes in the World Health Organization classification. =Hammersmith Hospital= Hammersmith Hospital in 2013 While Hugh-Jones was in Jamaica, Australian designer Kemp Fowler had designed and produced a respiratory mass spectrometer that could be used in people. Hammersmith Professor John McMichael persuaded Hugh-Jones to return to the UK and continue lung function research with the MRC at the Hammersmith Hospital. In 1955, Hugh-Jones did return to the U.K. after three years in Jamaica, to lead an MRC group and become a consultant physician at the Hammersmith Hospital and a lecturer at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. He witnessed the setting up of the UK's first mass spectrometer for research in lung function as part of the plan to develop an academic respiratory research group at the Hammersmith. He once accidentally recorded Prince Philip's lung function. Around 1957, Hugh-Jones was interested in bronchoscopy and took gas samples from different areas of the lung, noting that particular patterns of alveolar gas concentrations were caused by airway or blood obstruction. He used radioactive oxygen-15. When a person took a breath of the radioactive gas, keeping hold of their breath, the radioactivity over parts of the chest correlated with ventilation over those parts of the lung. In addition, local blood flow correlated with the rate at which radioactivity was removed. In addition, his work on the effects of asbestos on the lungs led him to frequently appear as an expert witness in asbestos trials. =Later career= King's College Hospital He joined King's College Hospital in 1964 where he continued his work in lung disease and set up their chest unit for the study and treatment of asthma, lung diseases, and sleep disorders. He was president of The Thoracic Society in 1979.\\"The Thoracic Society: A Retrospect\\" by J. G. Scadding, Thorax, Vol. 38 (1983), pp. 88–92. In 2000 he gave an oral history interview about his life to Queen Mary University of London. Personal life Hugh-Jones first married Sheila Hails in 1940 with whom he had a son and a daughter. His second marriage was to Hilary which produced two sons. He was a keen mountaineer and took friends, family, and colleagues on trips to the peaks of South America and Wales. He was an amateur painter. He suffered from bipolar disorder throughout his life. Death Hugh-Jones died on 1 June 2010. His funeral was held at West Norwood Crematorium.Philip Morrell Hugh-Jones.

Aldridge studied singing in Germany, England and France. She was said to be the \\"possessor of a true contralto voice\\" and had a wide vocal range. Charles Gounod said of her to Augustus Harris \\"Do you want to hear one of the most beautiful voices that exist? Very well! Give an audition to Mademoiselle Luranah Aldridge.\\" Harris featured Luranah in a Grand Wagner Orchestral Concert at St. James’s Hall in 1893. He also cast her as one of the Valkyries in the Ring. She sang in Ring Cycles in London in 1898 and 1905. She performed in London until the First World War, after which she became bedridden with rheumatism and no longer performed. In 1896, she was cast by Cosima Wagner to appear in the second full production of the Ring Cycle at the Bayreuth Festival. While rehearsing she fell ill, and was sent to a nearby spa to recuperate. She was unable to appear at the festival that year and despite an apparently friendly relationship with the Wagners was not invited back. Personal life Aldrich was the daughter of actor Ira Aldridge and self-styled Swedish countess Amanda von Brandt. She was named after Ira Aldridge's mother, Luranah. Her sister was British opera singer and composer Amanda Ira Aldridge. As Luranah's rheumatism grew worse, Amanda cared for her and described Luranah in 1921 as \\"very helpless\\".

In 1916 he started his own cannery, Hovden Canning Co (later known as K.Hovden Company), which became the most successful cannery in Monterey in the heyday of the sardine industry.

His innovation pervaded every stage of the canning process, from live fish to tin of sardines.

ABSD-3 was delivered to the US Navy in April 1944, and was commissioned on 27 October 1944. Advance Base Sectional Dock-3 (Auxiliary Floating Dock Big-3) was constructed in sections during 1942 and 1943. Each section was 3,850 tons and 93 feet long. Each section had a 165 feet beam, 75 feet molded depth and 10,000 tons lifting capacity. There were four ballast compartments in each section. With all nine sections joined, she was 844 feet long and 28 feet tall (keel to welldeck), with an inside clear width of 133 feet 7 inches. ABSD-2 had a traveling 15-ton capacity crane with an 85-foot radius and two or more support barges. The two side walls were folded down under tow to reduce wind resistance and lower the center of gravity. ABSD-3 had six capstans for pulling, each rated at at . Four of the capstans were reversible.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, Floating Dry DocksBuilding the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corps 1940-1946 Chapter IX, Floating Drydocksnavsource.org, ABSD-3 Construction The nine sections that made up dock ABSD-3 were built at four different shipyards, to speed up construction: *Section A - Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company in Stockton, California *Sections B & F - Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in Everett, Washington *Sections C & E - Chicago Bridge in Morgan City, Louisiana *Sections D, G, H & I - Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania World War II Commissioned on 27 October 1944, the USS ABSD-3 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. It was towed in sections to the Naval Base Guam at Apra Harbor in Guam, Marianas Islands. After assembling she was placed in service to repair ship at Guam with ABSD-6. On an island in the harbor at Guam the Navy built a base to support the crew of ABSD-3 and ABSD-6. At the base were supplies, movie theater, mess hall, officers' clubs, movie theater, and enlisted club. The base was built mostly with quonset huts. The largest repairs at Guam were that of the USS Pennsylvania near the end of World War II; the ship was hit by a kamikaze attack off Okinawa on 12 August 1945. Due to the Pennsylvanias 28.9 ft (8.8 m) draft with a full load, the battleship had to unload much of her ammunition and fuel oil before entering AFDB-3. The USS Idaho (BB-42) was also repaired in ABSD-3 after a kamikaze attack on the same day. Able to lift 90,000 tons, ABSD-3 could raise large ships such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and large auxiliary ships, out of the water for repair below the waterline. She was also used to repair multiple smaller ships at the same time. Ships in continuous use during war need repair both from wear and from war damage from naval mine and torpedoes. Rudders and propellers are best serviced on dry docks. Without ABSD-2 and her sister ships, at remote locations months could be lost in a ships returning to a home port for repair. ABSD-3 had power stations, ballast pumps, repair shops, and machine shops, and could be self-sustaining. ABSD-2 had two rail track moveable cranes able to lift tons of material and parts, for removing damaged parts and installing new parts. The first ship repaired at Guam was on 5 March 1945 and the last ship on 5 March 1946, after one year of operation.UN Navy Bureau of Ships Journal, Volume 1, page 7 May 1952 * Ships ABSD-3 repaired during World War 2:ABSD-3 Repair records *USS Napa (APA-157) *LST 802 *LST 822 *PC 42 *USS Minneapolis (CA-36) *LCI 544 *LCI 610 Landing Craft Infantry *AK 142 - Cargo Ship *LST 688 *LST 442 *YD USS McInteze *USS Alnitah (AK-127) *LST 827 *HM LST-421 *USS LST-486 *LCT 840 *LCT 830 Landing craft tank *LCT 868 *LCT 846 *AOD 186 *USS LST-546 *LST 646 *LCI 890 *LCI 910 *USS Idaho (BB-42) *USS South Dakota (BB-57) *USS Arkansas (BB-33) *YNT AN-48 USS Lancewood Net Layer Tug *YNT AN-47 USS Canotia *USS LST-1000 *USS LST-767 *LST 609 *USS Pittsburgh (CA-72) *YDGT 7 *SC-760 Submarine chaser *SC-1317 Submarine chaser *YMS 403 Minesweeper *YMS 361 Motor Minesweeper *YMS 163 *AGS 14 a surveying ship *APC 102 small coastal transport *APC 25 *APC 45 *USS Earle B.

Premise Fyre Fraud is described in its press release as a \\"true-crime comedy bolstered by a cast of whistleblowers, victims, and insiders going beyond the spectacle to uncover the power of FOMO and an ecosystem of enablers, driven by profit and a lack of accountability in the digital age\\". Production On April 16, 2018, it was announced that Hulu was developing a docuseries about the infamous failed 2017 musical festival Fyre Festival. The film was set to be directed by Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason and executive produced by Michael Gasparro, John Amato, Dana Miller, Angela Freedman, and Sharmi Gandhi. Production companies involved with the film were slated to include The Cinemart, Mic and Billboard. On January 14, 2019, Hulu debuted the production, titled Fyre Fraud, in a surprise \\"rush release\\" with no promotion, advertising, or press preceding the film's launch. The premiere allowed Hulu to get their project out to audiences four days before Netflix's documentary about the same subject, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, was released. In February 2019, Entertainment One acquired the international rights to Fyre Fraud. Reception The film was met with a positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 80% approval rating with an average rating of 6.41/10 based on 30 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"In the battle over Fyre Festival content, Fyre Fraud comes out swinging with a questionable interview of conman Billy McFarland and a thoughtful exploration of nefarious social strategy.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 66 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In a positive review, RogerEbert.coms Nick Allen gave the film a rating of 3½ out of 4 stars and praised it saying, \\"Fyre Fraud does not just dunk on McFarland, Ja Rule, and anyone who might be complicit—they’re clowns already, their plainly not-smart choices and astounding arrogance making for super-size schadenfreude. More persuasively, it's a damnation of the mentality that helped make it possible, calling out a culture that progressively puts more value into how you make yourself look online.\\" In a similarly favorable analysis, Deciders Joel Keller commended the film and recommended that viewers stream it declaring, \\"Fyre Fraud is a fascinating examination of social media influencers, millennials who get hooked on their feelings of FOMO, and a modern-day con artist who will likely learn nothing from this or his prison sentence.\\" In a more mixed assessment, Colliders Brian Tallerico gave the film a \\"B−\\" grade and said, \\"With a bit more polish and a bit more confidence, Fyre Fraud would be a powerful documentary that used Fyre Festival as a springboard for a more incisive examination of fraud in the age of social media, using the festival as a metaphor for expectations versus reality, which (as my wife astutely pointed out), is a mirror for how social media tends to function. Instead, Fyre Fraud is content to exist as a dark comedy of sorts, poking fun at the players involved without really absorbing the seriousness or gravity of their actions.\\" References External links Category:American films Category:Hulu original films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about music festivals Category:2019 documentary films Category:2019 films ","title":"Fyre Fraud"},{"id":"59666417","text":"FIDAC (French: Fédération Interalliée Des Anciens Combattants, English: The Interallied Federation of War Veterans Organisations) was established in Paris in November 1920, at the initiative of the veterans from World War I predominant pacifists, such as Hubert Aubert, director in UNC (National Combatants' Union), France,F.I.D.A.C. (Fédération Interalliée des Anciens Combattants) Paris 1933, p. 2-3 and in particular Charles Bertrand, Secretary- General of UNC and deputy in the French Parliament. They had the idea of uniting veterans’ associations established after the end of World War I in various allied countries into an international federation whose main purpose was to promote peace, continuously strengthen the brotherhood initiated on the battlefield, and provide help to the wounded, the disabled, widowers, war orphans, veterans, and also commemorate the heroes fallen in battles. Charles Bertrand, general secretary and future president of UNC in France, thus became the first president of FIDAC (1920–1924).  History  At the founding meeting on 28 November 1920, FIDAC was joined by associations of veterans from France (6 associations, including UNC and UF), United Kingdom (British Empire Service League and then British Legion), US (American Legion), Belgium (FNC), Romania (National Union of Former Combatants), Czechoslovakia (Druzina Association), Italy and Serbia. Later FIDAC was joined by veteran associations from Poland (in 1923) and Portugal (in 1927). FIDAC was founded on the principle of political and religious neutrality and forbid associations from former enemy countries to join. Subsequently, there were proposals for the federation to include the organizations of former combatants from Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and other former enemy countries. Proposals were rejected as this would have meant not only changing the constitution, but also the name of FIDAC, which had already become a symbol of unity. Instead, the decision was made to establish annual contacts with the war veterans' associations in the former enemy countries to discuss global peace issues and to create a permanent committee (CIP – French: Comité International Permanent), representing FIDAC and other organizations like CIAMAC (French: Conférence Internationale des Associations des Mutilés de guerre et Anciens Combattants) responsible with making the necessary arrangements to enable these contacts.The Spectator No.5, 594, 12 September 1935, p.2 Active between 1920 and 1940, this federation included a women's branch (\\"FIDAC Women's Auxiliary\\") in 1925, which promoted correspondence and student exchange programs between allied countries.F.I.D.A.C.

At their congress in Rome in 1925, Cointe Hill in Liège, Belgium was chosen as the site of this memorial. The construction began in 1928 and was completed in 1938. The Memorial included the Sacre-Cœur Church as a religious building and a tower as a civil memorial.

She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 and has been a champion of the struggle of women whose children were kidnapped and murdered by members of the Colombian Army to the south of Bogotá, who passed them off as guerrillas – the so-called \\"false positives\\". She managed to get Álvaro Uribe, the President of Colombia, to retract statements insulting the memory of the young people of Soacha, presented as guerrillas killed in combat during his democratic security policy. A judgment of reparation was handed down in 2014. After a decade working as a defender of human rights, in March 2018 she stood for election to the Senate as part of . Son's disappearance in 2008 Luz Marina Bernal is the mother of Fraí Leonardo Bernal, who was murdered by the Colombian Army, and driving force of the group , a group of women who denounced the killings of their children by the armed forces. The Office of the Attorney General has recognized the murder of her son as a crime against humanity, along with the disappearance of more than 4,500 young people. They are called the \\"false positives\\". Bernal had to face the disappearance of her son, who was 26 years old and suffered from a mental disability that caused him to function at a 10-year-old level. The last time she saw him was on 8 January 2008, when he left home in Soacha, a city of 800,000 located three hours south of Bogotá. The Soacha police did not search for the missing youths despite the complaints of the mothers, who tried to find them with no results. A doctor from the forensic office called Bernal nine months later to warn her that her son's body was in the morgue of Ocaña, Norte de Santander, 700 kilometers north of Soacha. The autopsy revealed that Fraí Leonardo Bernal died four days after his disappearance after being shot in the face. His mother was not surprised at this detail, given that her son could not fend for himself and lacked the capacity to become a guerrilla. Context of war in Colombia Toward the end of President Álvaro Uribe's second term, from 2006 to 2010, he gave impetus to a program to weaken armed guerrilla groups in Colombia. The government's defense minister signed a document offering rewards to soldiers who captured or killed guerrillas, as human rights organizations have brought to the attention of international bodies. It was ministerial directive number 29 that established: Defenders of human rights and the Mothers of Soacha have explained how the scheme worked: Mothers of Soacha In two years, from 2008 to 2010, there were 19 cases of disappearance in Soacha. In response, women gathered at police stations, offices of the Attorney General, and other spaces. They ended up uniting under the designation of the collective Mothers of Soacha. María Sanabria's son disappeared in the same manner as Luz Marina Bernal's, so she and Bernal decided to fight for justice together. From 2010 to 2014, these women protested weekly in Soacha's central plaza, with the support of human rights and neighborhood organizations. The protests were widely covered in Colombia's social media. In addition, in those years Bernal led petitions in more than ten countries on behalf of Mothers of Soacha, placing a focus on the Colombian justice system and its officials. Among the tasks performed by the members of the collective in Soacha were photographing the groups of soldiers when they were conducting raids and taking away young detainees in trucks, as well as asking the latter for their phone numbers to call their families immediately. Mothers of Soacha is an initiative backed by organizations such as Amnesty International. Despite the slow pace of the process, they continue to oppose impunity and to promote the actions of the Colombian justice system against inhumanity. Results on \\"false positives\\" Through the end of 2014, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia acknowledged receiving complaints of 4,716 murders allegedly committed by members of the security forces, which fit the characteristics of cases such as those of Jaime Estiven, the son of María Sanabria. The Office also reported that approximately 4,000 members of the Army were involved in these cases. As of that date, about 900 soldiers had been indicted. The United Nations published a report in early 2014 that reflected the slowness of the judicial system against these cases known as \\"false positives\\". By the end of 2014, only 294 cases had come to trial, although the majority still awaited sentencing. Meanwhile, studies of Colombian universities carried out between 2004 and 2014 reflected that cases of \\"false positives\\" had increased 154% in that period. Documentaries Bernal participated in the play Antígonas, Tribunal de Mujeres as an approach to using the performing arts as a form of demanding justice. She later participated in various documentaries and audiovisual works to increase visibility of the work of Mothers of Soacha. In 2014, Oxfam Intermón produced an audiovisual piece about the Mothers of Soacha in their Avanzadoras program, entitled Huellas que no callan (Footprints That Do Not Remain Silent). Also in 2014 the Mothers of Soacha turned to film to tell the story of their children, of continuing to look for their remains. In 2015 Bernal was featured in the documentary Mujeres al frente, la ley de las más fuertes (Women at the Front, the Law of the Strongest) by journalist , where her testimony, along with that of Mayerlis Angarita, , , Luz Marina Becerra, and Vera Grabe, is part of a series of stories that narrate the struggles and resistance of peasant women to survive the internal armed conflict and their responses to the abuses to which rural, black, and indigenous communities have been subjected. Recognitions The group Mothers of Soacha has been recognized with various international human rights awards, notably: * Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 * 2013 Builders of Peace Award, granted by the International Catalan Institute for Peace in the Parliament of Catalonia, Barcelona.

The abortion should also be conducted only at a Government hospital; registered private hospital, clinics registered under the Private Hospitals and Maternity Homes Act, 1958 (No. 8) and a place approved by the Minister of Health by a Legislative Instrument. Illegal Abortions are criminal offenses subject to at most five years in prison for the pregnant woman who induced said abortion, as well as for any doctor or other person who assisted this pregnant woman in accessing, or carrying out, an abortion.Abortion or miscarriage. Consolidation of Criminal Code of Ghana, 1960. Act 29. Section 58. 1999. Dec 10, pp. 37–38 Attempts to cause abortions are also criminal, as are the purveyance, supply, or procurement of chemicals and instruments whose intent is to induce abortions.  Terminology  The definition of abortion is quite wide. According to Act 29, section 58, article 3, of the Criminal code of 1960, “Abortion or miscarriage means premature expulsion or removal of conception from the uterus or womb before the period of gestation is completed.” Thus, both words, abortion and miscarriage, can be used interchangeably to refer to the same phenomenon. The law would seem to cover induced abortions, where the pregnant woman willfully expels a viable fetus, and also spontaneous abortions, or miscarriages, which may be encouraged by the pregnant woman through various means. Medically, there have been attempts to clearly distinguish between the two, but the laws in Ghana concerning this matter do not make this distinction.  Exceptions  In some situations, abortions are legal. The laws of Ghana allow abortions where (1) the pregnancy was as a result of rape, defilement, or incest, which are themselves all crimes in Ghana, and (2) where the pregnant woman requests the abortion. The pregnant woman's next of kin may request the abortion if the woman lacks the capacity to request it. For instance, if she is unconscious and in need of immediate medical attention that may entail abortion; if she is mentally incapable of making medical decisions (for example has an Intellectual disability); or if she is a minor according to the law. In Ghana, the age of minority is below eighteen years, although the legal age for marriage is sixteen years of age.  Law  Abortion is a criminal offence pursuant to Act 29, section 58 of the Criminal code of 1960, amended by PNDCL 102 of 1985, which states that: # Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section ## any woman who with intent to cause abortion or miscarriage administers to herself or consent to be administered to her any poison, drug or other noxious thing or uses any instrument or other means whatsoever; or ## any person who— ### administers to a woman any poison, drug or other noxious thing or uses any instrument or other means whatsoever with intent to cause abortion or miscarriage, whether or not the woman is pregnant or has given her consent ### induces a woman to cause or consent to causing abortion or miscarriage; ### aids and abets a woman to cause abortion or miscarriage; ### attempts to cause abortion or miscarriage; or ### supplies or procures any poison, drug, instrument or other thing knowing that it is intended to be used or employed to cause abortion or miscarriage; shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. # It is not an offense under section (1) if an abortion or miscarriage is caused in any of the following circumstances by a registered medical practitioner specializing in Gynaecology or any other registered medical practitioner in a government hospital or a private hospital or clinic registered under the Private Hospital and Maternity Home Act, 1958 (No. 9) or in a place approved for the purpose by legislative instrument made by the Secretary: ## where pregnancy is the result of rape or defilement of a female idiot or incest and the abortion or miscarriage is requested by the victim or her next of kin or the person in loco parentis, if she lacks the capacity to make such request; ## where the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman or injury to her physical or mental health and such a woman consents to it or if she lacks the capacity to give such consent it is given on her behalf by her next of kin or the person in loco parentis; ## where there is substantial risk that if the child were born it may suffer from or later develop a serious physical abnormality or disease. # For the purposes of this section, abortion or miscarriage means premature expulsion or removal of conception from the uterus or womb before the period of gestation is completed.  Statistics  According to national statistical data from 2009, 7% of all pregnancies are aborted. Within the population of women between 15 and 49, 15% have had abortions.Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), Ghana Health Service (GHS) and Macro International, Ghana Maternal Health Survey 2007, Accra, Ghana: GSS and GHS; and Calverton, MD, USA: Macro International, 2009. For every 1,000 women in Ghana of childbearing age of 15 to 44, 15 abortions are performed. Another study carried out in the 1990s suggested that in southern Ghana, the number is marginally higher, at 17 abortions for every 1,000 women. This number is lower than the statistics available for West Africa as a whole: abortions rates are at 28 per 1,000 womenWorld Health Organization (WHO), Unsafe Abortion: Global and Regional Estimates of the Incidence of Unsafe Abortion and Associated Mortality in 2003, fifth ed., Geneva: WHO, 2007 Ghanaian women of the following demographics are more likely to have abortions: women who have never been married; women in their twenties; women with no children; wealthy women; and women from urban areas. Never-married women are twice as likely to seek the procedure as those who are married. The tendency to seek abortion decreases with number of children: women with no children are seven times more likely to seek an abortion than women with three or more children. For these women, the most prominent reason for seeking the abortion was the stigma associated with having a child out of wedlock. Women who have had previous abortions are far more likely to seek the procedure. Researchers peg this to the possibility that these women may have more knowledge, both of the legal status of abortions, and more likely, where to obtain the procedure. Women in the top 40% of the wealth distribution in the country are 67% - 80% more likely to have abortions that their poorer counterparts. Younger women are more likely to seek abortions, with women between 20 and 24 years being most likely, at 25 abortions per 1,000 women, and the frequency decreasing with every successive age group. Urban women are far more likely to have abortions, with 34 abortions per 1,000 women. Overall, urbanites are 110% more likely to seek abortions than their rural counterparts, at 21 abortions per 1,000 women versus 10 abortions per 1,000 women. The reasons that Ghanaian women give for seeking abortions include: the financial inability to care for a child; the pregnancy interfering with their occupation or schooling; and wanting to space out their childbearing or to limit family size.Aboagye PK et al., An Assessment of the Readiness to Offer Contraceptives and Comprehensive Abortion Care in the Greater Accra, Eastern, and Ashanti Regions of Ghana, Chapel Hill, NC, USA: Ipas, 2007.Blanc AK and Grey S, Greater than expected fertility decline in Ghana: untangling a puzzle, Journal of Biosocial Science, 2002, 34(4):475-495.Baiden FK et al., Unmet need for essential obstetric services in a rural district in Northern Ghana: complications of unsafe abortions remain a major cause of mortality, Journal of the Royal Institute of Public Health, 2006, 120(5):421–426. Also due to limited number of legal practitioners to perform safe abortion, it is expensive therefore many women cannot afford it and they turn to have unsafe abortion by unskilled practitionersMorhee RAS and Morhee ESK, \\"Overview of the law and availability of abortion services in Ghana\\", Ghana Medical Journal, September 2006, 40(3): 80-86 Approximately 45% of abortions in Ghana are unsafe. 11% of Ghanaian maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions, and maternal mortality is the second leading cause of death among Ghanaian women. Some women experience complications from these experiences. Because so few women know that abortions are legal on many grounds in Ghana, they do not seek, or demand post abortion care, even when they have legitimate reasons to obtain legal abortions. According to a 2007 survey, only 3% of pregnant women, and 6% of women actively seeking abortions, knew the laws surrounding the procedure. These numbers are relatively unreliable, because of how stigmatized abortions are in Ghana. Much of this data was collected based on face-to-face interviews, rendering it unlikely that they will reveal an accurate estimate of the occurrence of abortions. According to a paper, the number of abortions in Ghana is more likely to be closer to the West African rate of 28 per 1,000 women.  Abortion and Contraceptives  The low rate of contraceptive use is part of the driver for abortions. According to national statistical data, contraceptive use has increased over the decades, but from 13% use by married women in 1988, to just 25% by this demographic in 2003 followed by a slight decline to 24% in 2008. A much higher proportion of sexually active unmarried women use modern contraceptives, but in 2008, this number was just 28% of the population. As such, 35% of married women, and 20% of sexually active unmarried married fall in the pool of people who are not seeking children, and yet are not using any modern contraceptive methods. As a consequence of this dearth, upwards of 37% of pregnancies in Ghana are unintended. A further 23% are mistimed, that is to say, do not occur at a time preferred by the individuals. 14% of all pregnancies are not wanted by the individuals pregnant. This translates to more than 300,000 children being products of unwanted pregnancies. Overall, the average number of children Ghanaian women have has decreased from 6.4 to 4.0 between 1988 and 2008. Nonetheless, this does not match the recorded desire of women, who wish to have less than four children. For more than a third of these women who are not looking for children nor are on contraceptives, the reason they give for not doing so are often health related, or a fear of the side effects and the risks associated with the use of contraceptives. The proportion of women in this pool rises with education and urbanity. Poorer women are overall more likely to have unplanned births, and less likely to use modern contraceptives, than their wealthier counterparts.

Opened in 1940 to replace Rockford High School, West opened simultaneous to Rockford East to serve the quickly expanding population. History By 1935, the attendance in Rockford's single high school grew too large. The board of education decided it would be best to establish two new high schools on the East and West sides of the Rock River. In 1938, the school board approved $3 million in funding to build two new high schools to replace Rockford High School, with 45% of the budget funded by Works Progress Administration. Rockford High School was renamed as Central High School and the two new schools were opened as East High School and West High School. Rockford West, located on North Rockton Avenue on the Northwest side of the city, remained open for 48 years as a high school, it now serves as West Middle School. Rockford East, located on Charles Street, is still a functioning high school and maintains the traditions of Rockford High School. High school athletics The West basketball team won back-to-back IHSA state championships in 1955 and 1956. Coached by Alex Saudargas, West was the third team in the history of the IHSA to win consecutive championships and gave Rockford its fourth and fifth state championships in basketball. West made the finals seven other times, 1942–43, 1943–44, 1948–49, 1958–59, 1965–66, 1966–67, and 1972–73; however, they only placed fourth in their 1967 appearance. West had four other state championship teams while serving as a high school. The boys' golf team became state champions during 1940–41, debate won two championships, the first during the 1946–47 school year, the second in 1959–60. Finally, the 1975–76 girls' field hockey team won the last championship for West High School. Individually, the school won an additional ten state championships in boys and girls swimming, boys golf, boys tennis and boys track and field. Ronald Merriott, class of 1978, won an Olympic bronze in diving during the 1984 summer games. Prior to the Olympics, Merriott won the NCAA championship in 3-meter springboard diving while attending the University of Michigan. Facilities Built in 1939 as part of the Works Progress Administration project which also resulted in the construction of East, the basic design of both buildings was by Gilbert Johnson, the exterior facade, however, was designed by Jesse Barloga in the Art Modeme style. East exterior façade, on the other hand, was designed by Willis Hubbard. East was also considered an excellent example of Art Modeme architecture, and a focal point from the community from its beginning. The gymnasium was named in honor of longtime boys basketball coach Alex Saudargas, who had a record of 435–198 while coaching West.Chicago Tribune – June 1, 1989 In fall 1969 a football stadium was built and opened next to Auburn High School. Originally, and for many years, the stadium was called \\"Westburn Stadium\\", and was used by both West and Auburn High School, based on the fact that West had no stadium on their campus. Currently, Auburn shares the stadium (now named for their first principal, John W. Wyeth Stadium) with Jefferson High School, as Jefferson also has no home stadium on its campus. Prior to the 1969–70 school year West played their \\"home\\" football games and track & field meets at Charles Beyer Stadium located at 15th Avenue & Seminary Street from 1960 to 1968 and two games in the fall of 1969 before moving to their current facility during the fall of 1969. (Beyer Stadium was also the home of the Rockford Peaches of the AAGBL from 1943 to 1954.) Information Rockford Central's nickname, \\"Rabs\\", was based on the school colors; red and black, West inherited those same colors, but changed the mascot to \\"Warriors\\". Rockford East also uses red and black for their school colors and continues to use \\"Rabs\\" as the team nickname; however, based on their location, an E was added making their mascot the \\"E-Rabs\\", which stands for East-Red And Blacks.

Some jobs of those who work in a costume shop are designers, builders, seamstresses and stitchers. The shops themselves can all vary in size, from one large room to a house with multiple floors. Costumes from past productions, fabric, jewelry and accessories are all often stored in the shop as well.  Purpose  Costume shops are all different shapes and sizes, however, what they have in common is what makes them an integral part of a theater space. Every costume shop is where the costumes worn on stage for a production are built. Some costume shops have washers for cleaning costumes, fitting rooms, racks for storage or spaces for designers to conceptualize a costume. Some shops allow you to rent their costumes. However the most common and main purpose for a costume shop is for building and finishing pieces that go onstage. There is no standard layout for costume shops though most have stations for stitching or surging, cutting tables, fabric storage, and finishing tables. A large an expansive costume shop style helps work to enable productions to be mounted lavishly and permit study and experimentation at the same time.Clark, John. “Creative Arts School in a Liberal Arts College: The Drama Program at San Francisco State College.” Educational Theatre Journal, vol. 18, no. 2, 1966, pp. 108–109. . The process of building a costume requires many different steps and stations, for which the costume designer first conceptualizes.Covey, Ingham, Liz, Rosemary (1992). The Costume Designer's Handbook. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann. pp. 15–100. But before building can begin, the designer must choose where the costumes will come from. Costume storage at the Radio City Music Hall Once the show is designed, pieces can come from a multitude of places, but there are commonly four different options:Brockett, Hildy, Oscar G., Franklin J. (2007). History of the Theatre. USA: Pearson Education Inc. p. 211. . * Rented, either from other theatres, businesses, or individuals * Pulled, which refers to searching through a costume shops stock. ‘Pulling’ from the rack of stored costumes. * Constructed, ones that the designer and costume shop create themselves. * Shopped, items that can be purchased from outside sources. The costume shop will search, place orders, create, organize, and dole out the costumes for each production and each character in the manner that best fits the costume and production itself. For instance, not every shoe is cobbled in the shop, or 'in house,' some are bought and some are borrowed. It is the costume shops purpose to handle this feat.  Jobs within  Within a costume shop there are a multitude of people working on different parts of the creative or accumulative process, depending on the size of the theatre or company will determine if each job goes to one person, if a group of individuals share more than one job, or if everyone pitches in on everything. = Costume designer = The costume designer is an integral part of the production's creative team. Each costume designer is different, however they work closely with the director to develop a look for the actors onstage that best serves the plot of the play and concept the director has envisioned. \\"The Costume Designer seeks inspiration from many sources, including interviews with the actors who will play the characters, and extensive historical and visual research.\\" Depending on if the Costume Designer is a permanent position or is a by production hire will determine if they are considered the head of the costume department or shop = Assistant designer = The assistant designer helps the head designer with the different jobs that must be completed. This includes but is not limited to :research, shopping, rental acquisition and fittings for actors. = Costume coordinator/supervisor/shop manager = A shop manager is responsible for daily goings on in the shop, much like a manager in a building or restaurant. They deal with the costume budget from the producers, manufacturing and purchasing, as well as work and costume building schedules and production crew requirements. = Cutter/draper = The cutter/draper is responsible for making patterns, cutting, fitting and construction of costumes from specific designs or sketches supplied by the designer. \\"The Cutter may assist in selecting materials and supervising the costume construction.\\" In most shops there are multiple cutters and drapers to ease and spread out work load. = Stitcher (sewer, seamstress, costume builder) = A stitcher works on the actual construction of the costumes. The Stitcher will sometimes assist during fittings to help with pinning and alterations. They are the entry-level position in a costume shop and are often the most common job that is open in a space. A stitcher will help pick up wherever needed, often stretching out from fittings, pinning, and alteration, to textiles, dye working and errands.

The distillery was shut down in 1918 and reestablished by owners Jack Wells and Josh Quinn, Boone County Kentucky.  History  In 1833 William Snyder and his brother John bought the Petersburg steam mill in Boone County and convert it into the Petersburg Distillery. The original distillery was plotted on a 1000-acre tract of land. In1860 the Distillery had produced one million gallons of whisky and in 1861 the Col. William Appleton (who is the Snyder's son in law) bought the distillery after the Snyder's brothers assets were seized by the government due to 15 writs of fiera facias issued against William Snyder by as many men asking for repayment of debts ranging from $500 to $6,000, the debt totaling $30,000. Due to the $1.50/gallon liquor tax imposed on distributors during the Civil War, Appleton sold the Distillery to Joseph C. Jenkins and James Gaff. By 1880 the Petersburg Distillery had become the largest distillery in the state of Kentucky. By 1910 the distillery had been shut down due to lack of visitors to the town Petersburg and the final reserves were be sold off by 1918.

Bell worked in an iron foundry in his hometown of Nottingham.1911 England Census In 1898, he joined the Friendly Society of Iron Founders (FSIF), and he soon became active on Nottingham Trades Council, and in the Labour Party. He first stood for Nottingham City Council in 1907. Bell became known as a strong speaker, and he became increasingly prominent in the FSIF. In 1911, he moved a resolution that the union should appoint full-time organisers. This was passed, and he secured one of the first positions. He later became the union's assistant general secretary. He was noted for his anti-German attitude during World War I, stating that Britain should \\"wipe the Germans out\\". In 1920, the union merged into the new National Union of Foundry Workers, and Bell left in 1922 to work for the GFTU. Bell became the GFTU's first full-time organiser, travelling the country to negotiate with employers and between unions, and trying to gain the federation new affiliates. He proved unsuccessful at increasing membership, but he became popular with the unions affiliated to the GFTU, and was considered to be especially sympathetic to their officials, and he increasingly took over policy work from the general secretary, William A. Appleton. In 1938, Appleton retired, and Bell was elected unopposed as his replacement. The GFTU had stagnated under Appleton's leadership, and had increasingly come to represent smaller, craft unions. Bell saw the union through World War II, with a reduced staff and little input from member unions. The expansion of the welfare state after the war removed most of the GFTU's role in providing insurance coverage to workers. The organisation only survived the 1940s after it was determined that, if it was dissolved, founder members which had long since left would be entitled to a share of its substantial reserves. Bell was nearly 70 by 1947, when the GFTU changed its rules to state that its general secretary must retire, and would receive a pension, from that age. But the uncertainty over whether the organisation would dissolve led the management council to repeatedly ask him to defer his retirement. As he and his wife had become the guardian of a young, orphaned, granddaughter, he was happy to continue, and from 1950 he tentatively introduced some new initiatives: joint campaigns with the Trades Union Congress, and from 1951, the quarterly Federation News in 1951. In 1951, the management council appointed Harry Earnshaw to take over from Bell, but Earnshaw withdrew, and Bell continued in post. Leslie Hodgson was appointed as assistant general secretary in 1952, with a promise that, if his work was satisfactory that he would be promoted two years later, but Bell announced that he did not want an assistant and no longer wished to retire. Despite this, his health became increasingly poor, and early in 1953, he was persuaded to take a six-month leave of absence. At the end of the period, he was finally persuaded to retire. He died six years later.

The latter assigned Muslim, a staunch loyalist who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Siffin, to be the commander of an expedition against the people of Medina for refusing to give Yazid the oath of allegiance. The victory of Muslim at the Battle of al-Harrah in 683 and the subsequent pillaging of Medina by his army was considered among the major injustices carried out by the Umayyads. Muslim died shortly after. Life Details about Muslim's early life and career are scant.Lammens, p. 693. He was most likely born before the Hijra in 622, the start of the Islamic calendar.Lammens, p. 694. He was the son of a certain Uqba of the Banu Murra, a branch of the Arab tribe of Ghatafan.Gil 1997, p. 120. Muslim most likely moved to Syria from Arabia during the Muslim conquest of the region in the 630s. He became a committed partisan of the Umayyad clan of the province's governor, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan. During the First Muslim Civil War, Muslim distinguished himself at the head of a contingent of Syrian infantry in Mu'awiya's army at the Battle of Siffin in Upper Mesopotamia against Caliph Ali ( 656–661) and his supporters. However, he was unable to wrest control from the latter of the Dumat al-Jandal oasis in northern Arabia during a later battle. When Mu'awiya became caliph in 661, he gave Muslim the lucrative post of land tax collector in Palestine, though he was known not to have taken advantage of this post for self-enrichment. Later, when Mu'awiya was on his deathbed, he made Muslim and the governor of Damascus, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al- Fihri, regents until his son and chosen successor, Yazid I( 680–683), returned to Syria from the battlefield with the Byzantines in Anatolia. Mu'awiya died in 680 and Yazid acceded as caliph, though this dynastic succession, until then unprecedented in the caliphate, was not recognized by the Ansar (the Islamic prophet Muhammad's early supporters in Medina).Lammens, pp. 693–694. Muslim was sent at the head of an embassy by Yazid to bring the people of Medina into line with his rule, but this attempt was rebuffed. In response, Yazid again dispatched Muslim, this time as the commander of an expeditionary army, to subdue the people of Medina and Mecca. At the time, Muslim was elderly and ill and had to be transported in a litter. En route to Medina, Muslim encountered a group of Umayyads at Wadi al-Qura who had been expelled from the town. They aided him with information about Medina's defenses. When he reached the town's outskirts, he encamped his army at Harrat Waqim, where he commenced three days of negotiations with the Ansar and Quraysh opponents of Yazid. When the negotiations failed, Muslim drew up plans for battle, which occurred on 26 August 683 and became known as the Battle of al-Harrah. The Ansar took the advantage in the early part of the battle, but were ultimately routed by Muslim's Syrian forces, who pursued the survivors into Medina. Muslim's troops subsequently plundered the city before he reined them in the following day. Afterward, he prosecuted the captive leaders of the revolt. Following his victory, Muslim put one of his deputies, Rawh ibn Zinba al- Judhami, in charge of Medina, while he set off for Mecca to subdue the rebel leader Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. On the way, he fell ill at al-Mushallal and transferred command of the army to his deputy Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni. He died soon after and was buried in Mushallal, where his tomb long became a target of stone-throwing by passersby. Assessment In Islamic tradition, the pillaging of Medina, one of Islam's holiest cities, by Muslim's army was one of the major crimes committed by the Umayyads.Hawting, pp. 47–48. Muslim is the only person to be explicitly cursed in the work of the Sunni Muslim historian Khalifa ibn Khayyat, who accused the general of committing a massacre and other major injustices in Medina.Anderson, pp. 260. Islamic historians who sympathized with Shia Islam often disparagingly referred to him as \\"Musrif\\" (spendthrift or irresponsible actor), a play on his given name. However, the 20th-century Orientalist historian Henri Lammens dismissed the descriptions of Muslim and his actions in Medina by medieval Muslim sources as \\"exaggerations\\". He considered Muslim to be largely incorruptible and one of the Arab generals \\"whose talents contributed so much to establish the power of the Umayyads\\". He further asserted that Muslim’s career shows him to be “a convinced Muslim of a rectitude rare in this period of unsettlement, which saw so many extraordinary vicissitudes of fortune and wavering loyalties\\".

Biography After education at Repton, William Errington Hume matriculated in October 1897 at Pembroke College, Cambridge and graduated there BA in 1900. After medical education at the London Hospital, he graduated MB BChir and MA in 1904 and MD in 1913 from the University of Cambridge. At the London Hospital, he clerked for Sir Bertrand Dawson. At the Royal Victoria Infirmary, after holding junior appointments from 1904 to 1907, at age 28 he was appointed assistant physician and, six months later, full physician. He held this post until 1939 when he retired as consulting physician. He qualified MRCP in 1909. In WWI Hume served from 1914 to 1919 in the RAMC, attaining the rank of colonel. He was elected FRCP in 1917. He was mentioned twice in despatches and made in 1919 Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. On 21 February 1922 Hume wrote to John Cowan (1870–1947) with a suggestion for those physicians who had been attending meetings to give advice on heart disease to the Ministry of Pensions. Hume suggested that those physicians should be called together at the next meeting of the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland. The cardiologists' meeting, chaired by Alexander George Gibson (1875–1950), formed the Cardiac Club on 22 April 1922. The Cardiac Club became in 1937 the Cardiac Society of Great Britain and Ireland. The Society was renamed in 1946 the British Cardiac Society and renamed in 2006 the British Cardiovascular Society. Under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians, Hume gave in 1930 the Bradshaw Lecture on Paroxysmal tachycardia and in 1943 the Harveian Oration on The Physician in War—in Harvey's Time and After. He held the chair of medicine of Durham University for several years before WWII. After retiring in 1939 from the Honorary Staff of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Hume became a cardiologist at the Newcastle General Hospital and helped to initiate a Regional Cardiovascular Department there. From 1950 onward he suffered increasingly from arthritis. He was knighted in 1952. Family George Haliburton Hume (1845–1923), surgeon to the Newcastle Infirmary, was William Errington Hume's father. William Hume's younger brother was killed in WWI. In 1918 William Hume married Marie Élisabeth Tisseyre, eldest daughter of a colonel in the French Army. The couple (a Protestant husband and a French Catholic mother) had two sons and three daughters. Their elder son George Haliburton Hume became Basil Hume, an English Roman Catholic bishop. Their younger son John Hume became a medical doctor in Sunderland. Their eldest daughter Madeleine Frances Hume married Sir John Charles. Selected publications with S. J.

Early life  William Stuart McMullen was born to James Henry and Ettie McMullen of Toronto in Canada. He attended Leslie Street Public School before moving on to Riverdale Collegiate. There is some debate as to William's age, depending on the source he was aged either 29 or 33. It's thought he gave his age as younger upon enlisting in the air force as he was too old for pilot training. On his Royal Canadian Air Force Attestation Paper he gives his date of birth as 16 September 1915.Library and Archives Canada; Ottawa, Canada; Service Files of the Second World War - War Dead, 1939-1947; Series: RG 24; Volume: 28161 However, the 1921 Canadian Census lists his date of birth as 16 September 1911.Reference Number: RG 31; Folder Number: 99; Census Place: Toronto (City, part), York East, Ontario; Page Number: 12 After completing school he worked as a Coca-Cola sales rep and a driller in a goldmine, with his disposable income going towards flying lessons.  Wartime Service  Since he was a boy William had a love of flight and with the outbreak of war he enrolled in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Of his career choice William wrote - William secured his flight wings in November 1942 and went to the United Kingdom to train on Avro Lancaster bombers in 1944. In the UK he was appointed to a crew who had lost their previous pilot to injury and with them joined 428 Squadron at RAF Middleton St George. = Training Mission and Death = After going without a mission for 3 weeks the squadron was sent on a navigational training mission. After departing in Lancaster KB793 at 17.47 all went well with their journey over the North York Moors and they turned for home. When only 10 minutes from landing the outer port engine caught fire, with wireless operator Flight Sergeant Steve Ratsoy reporting sparks and a red glow. McMullen ordered his Flight Engineer \\"Lew\\" Lewellin to feather the engine to shut it down. However, it would later be found that the feathering pipe had already been consumed by the fire. So when the button was pressed it was adding oil to the fire rather than feathering the engine. Ratsoy reported a sheet of flame and the red glow expanding down the wing. With the aircraft stricken, McMullen gave the order to abandon the bomber, \\"Jump, jump, jump\\". One by one the crew parachuted to safety, with Lewellin the last to leave. The accident report states that in reply to Lewellin's question, McMullen said, “Yes, go on, get out, I’m right behind you...”. Although press reports have his last words as being, \\"It's only me for it. There are thousands down below\\". However, he decided not to follow and remained at the controls. He stayed at his post as witnesses reported the flames changing from the orange of burning fuel to the white of burning metal. McMullen directed the aeroplane away from the houses of Darlington and onto Lingfield Farm where it cartwheeled for 150 yards with McMullen killed on impact. He was found still in his seat 120 yards from the wreckage and his boots were still strapped to the pedals of the cockpit. The accident report noted - McMullen rests in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Harrogate (Stonefall) Cemetery.  Post Accident Reaction  = Investigation = Flight Lieutenant Frank E. Lynch was appointed to lead the investigation into the accident and he submitted his report dated 20 January 1945. His report concluded that following analysis by Rolls Royce engineers the crash was caused by a failure of the No. 6 A piston. The cause of the failure was not known but Rolls Royce were to continue their examinations of the wreckage. The report also noted that - = Tributes = The memorial to Pilot Officer McMullen on McMullen Road in Darlington. In the wake of the accident the Darlington Gallant Airman Fund was established and raised £1,000 for McMullen's widow Thelma (whom he married in 1937) and their daughter Donna Mae. However, Thelma returned the money saying that with Britain having sustained such war damage it should be put to use there. So the town sent Thelma an ornate silver rose bowl with the remainder of the funds used on two children's cots for Darlington Memorial Hospital. McMullen's sister Mae attended a presentation ceremony as the cots were given to the hospital in 1945. In further tribute, Lingfield Lane near the crash site was renamed McMullen Road in his honour with a memorial stone also placed. However, in later years the stone was consumed by undergrowth and the cots with their memorial plaques lost in a hospital reorganisation. By the time of the 50th Anniversary in 1995 a new stone was put in place and a ceremony held.

Mad Bodies is a Breakout-style vertically scrolling shooter game that heavily borrows elements from both Atari's 1976 arcade game Breakout and Gottlieb's 1983 multidirectional shooter Mad Planets, where the player controls the \\"ETHunter\\" space vessel as a paddle in order to either ricochet the planetoids (which act as balls) back and forth or destroy them by manually aiming the paddle's reticle to the target and shoot against them as the main objective across ten rounds, with each one increasing in difficulty as the player progress further on the game.Mad Bodies game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) In addition with the planetoids, the player must also shoot against incoming enemies from the top of the screen, which come as a group of five ships, but there are occasions where they only come as a group of three instead and are capable of shooting at the player's paddle, while more enemy types are introduced in later rounds. Managing to successfully destroy a group of enemies will increase the player's score five times than normal. The paddle can only withstand five hits from enemy fire and it deteriorates as well if the player fails to rebound the planetoids or by crashing against enemy ships. However, if the paddle collides with a meteor, the player instantly loses a stock of their lives and once all lives are lost, the game is over, though the player has the option of continuing before the timer reaches zero and they will be mocked by the character at the continue screen depending on how long it takes to keep playing. The game will also rank the player at the high-score screen depending on how many continues were used during gameplay. After every 3000 points, an extra life is granted. When reaching the third round, stranded astronauts and satellites are introduced and the former must be picked up with the edge of the paddle's reticle to rescue them. Gathering enough astronauts with the reticle and delivering them to the satellites will give the player a power-up item that is picked up by either with the paddle itself or by shooting at it, granting the ability to launch the paddle as a slingshot. However, if the player keeps gathering enough astronauts but does not deliver them to the satellites will increase the paddle's firepower and when powered up, it will grant the ability to shoot lasers. Powering up is also the only way to restore the paddle back to normal but if the player touches the astronauts with the paddle, however, they will be pushed off-screen. At the end of the fifth and tenth rounds, a boss is introduced and the player must rebound their orange projectiles two times in a row to turn them purple in order to deal damage at the boss, while their pattern becomes more erratic as they take more damage during the fight.  Development and release  Mad Bodies was conceived and developed by a small team at FORCE Design, an American company founded in 1998 by college graduate and freelance artist Terance Williams a year before Hasbro Interactive released the patents and rights to the Atari Jaguar into public domain in 1999 by declaring it as an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development as a result, becoming one of the few independent developers committed to the Jaguar at the time. The game was jointly programmed by Scott Walters and Terance, who also created the hand-drawn graphics and worked as the project's sole level designer, in addition of creating the sound effects. The music was composed by Aki Nordman, with assistance from both Terance and 3D Stooges Software Studios CEO Steven Scavone. The title was originally intended to be released for the Atari Jaguar CD add-on, but the plan was cancelled at some point during development and the game was instead published on the cartridge format. Development lasted between six and eight years. Mad Bodies was first showcased across various events such as Midwest Gaming Classic in 2003. It was later displayed and playable to the public at the JagFest booth during the Cleveland Classic Console and Arcade Gaming Show in 2004, albeit in an early state of completion. The game was officially released on May 2, 2009 as a limited run for US$79.99 and came packaged in a clamshell case, although a one-of-a-kind packaging mimicking an officially licensed Jaguar release does exists in the hands of a video game collector. Prior to its launch, it received a teaser trailer featuring extremely rough hand-drawn artwork. The title received coverage from gaming news websites such as Kotaku and The Escapist for being on a console deemed as a commercial failure. After release, the game has been showcased at Jaguar-dedicated festivals such as E-JagFest.  Reception  Mad Bodies received positive reception from the few video game-dedicated outlets that reviewed the game when it launched, due to being released long after the system was discontinued. Classic Video Game Magazine's Mike Pittaro praised the presentation, visuals, music and originality, though he criticized the game's high difficulty but remarked that \\"MB is a frustrating experience that delivers, without a doubt, endless hours of gameplay\\". Thumbpad also gave a positive review to the game in their May 29, 2009 podcast and gave it two thumbs-up.  Legacy  Mad Bodies remains the only completed and shipped title by FORCE Design as of date and was part from one of the many projects in development by the group for the Jaguar platform and possibly for other systems, as the company has more titles planned to be released; CRAZE (a multidirectional shooter similar to Berzerk and its sequel), Legion Force Jidai: The Next Era! (a Metal Slug-inspired run and gun project), Gp Earth GOD's Troopers (a shoot 'em up in vein of Gorf), Battle Puzzler! (a tile- matching puzzle fighting game akin to Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo), a sports game called Black Jag: Hyper Power League and a Q*bert-esque action-puzzle game project titled MightyFrog, among others that remain in development hell. Some of them have received updates in the form of image/video previews, while others had a demo released or showcased to the public.

It is a lesion or mass that typically starts out as an epithelial lined cyst, and undergoes an inward curvature that results in inflammation of granulation tissue at the root tips of a dead tooth. This is usually due to dental caries or a bacterial infection of the dental pulp. Periapical granuloma is an infrequent disorder that has an occurrence rate between 9.3 to 87.1 percent. Periapical granuloma is not a true granuloma due to the fact that it does not contain granulomatous inflammation; however, periapical granuloma is a common term used.  Symptoms  Patients who have a periapical granuloma are usually asymptomatic; however, when there is inflammation, patients could experience temperature sensitivity, pain while chewing solid foods, swelling and sensitivity to a dental percussion test. Generally, periapical granuloma is diagnosed due to acute pain in a tooth, or during a radiographic examination in routine visits to the dentist.Cleveland Clinic. (2017, January 26). Acute Pain vs. Chronic Pain. Retrieved from https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain  Radiographic Features  When looking at the radiographic features of periapical granuloma, typically there is a radiolucent lesion visible at the tip of a root on a nonvital tooth. This often is associated with root resorption. The radiolucency must correlate with the lateral root surface or the root of the tooth. The average size of radiography when looking at periapical granuloma is 7.4 millimeters (mm).  Histopathology  When examining the tissues of periapical granuloma for disease, hyperaemia, oedema and chronic inflammation is observed in the periodontal ligament. The vascular amplification and inflammation is adjacent to the bone, and bone absorption occurs next to a large growth in fibroblast and endothelial cells which is composed of the minute fibers (fibrils) with small vascular conduits (channels of passage for fluids). The lesion is predominantly composed of plasma cells that are mixed with macrophages and lymphocytes with endothelial cells and fibroblasts.  Treatment  Treatment for periapical granuloma is initially treated with a nonsurgical procedure. Endodontic treatments of teeth with periapical lesions (lesions that occurred as a result of dental pulp inflammation) have a success rate up to 85 percent. Other forms of nonsurgical treatments used for periapical lesions are: a root canal, an aspiration- irrigation technique (a technique to help minimize the force required for the removal of root canal irrigant); a decompression technique (a minimally invasive surgery that involves the placement of tubing to help maintain drainage); Lesion Sterilization and Repair Therapy (a technique that allows disinfection of pulpal (dental pulp), dentinal (dentin) and periradicular (around a root) lesions by using a combination of antibacterial drugs; a method using calcium hydroxide and the Apexum procedure (a minimally invasive removal, through a root canal access, of periapical chronically inflamed tissue). It is essential to monitor the healing closely after treatment with frequent follow-up examinations. If nonsurgical techniques fail, surgical intervention is then recommended. There are many things to be considered prior to surgical treatment in order to decide which technique will have the best outcome. When determining an approach for surgical approaches, clinicians must establish the correct diagnosis of the lesion to make sure there isn’t treatment being done on healthy (vital) teeth. It is also important to take into consideration the distance (proximity) of the lesion to the vital teeth. If the lesion is in close proximity to the roots of vital teeth, a surgical approach may have negative outcomes that include the blood vessels and nerves of the adjacent teeth being injured, this of which would jeopardize their vitality (life). Surgical approaches increase the risk of the anatomic structures being damaged. Some of these anatomic structures include: the nasal cavity, mental foramen, the inferior alveolar nerve and / or the inferior alveolar artery and the maxillary sinus. When sinus cavities or adjacent tissue spaces are involved, the nonsurgical aspiration-irrigation technique is also not advised. The patient’s cooperation and age of the patient are very important as well. Patients may experience pain or discomfort during or after treatment when taking the surgical approach which could make them uncooperative. Patients that are older may not be able to tolerate this pain or discomfort, therefore they may require nonsurgical approaches. If access to the apical foramen is prevented due to blockages in the root canal system, a surgical approach may be warranted. Finally, surgery is recommended in cases where patients have the presence of cholesterol crystals or inflammatory apical true cysts (the top of an enclosed space lined by the epithelium and usually contains fluid) due to the fact that these can prevent the healing of the lesions.

It was founded by Stephen William Silver in March 1864 as Silver's Indiarubber Works and Telegraph Cable Company Ltd. However in July that year the name was changed to the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company. Origins S.W. Silver & Company had been doing business since the 18th century supplying colonial and army needs for clothing and acting as shipping agents for those personnel traveling overseas. After Charles Macintosh developed waterproofing for fabric the company set up a factory at Greenwich for manufacture of such goods. After that factory began manufacture of insulated wire and cable the factory was moved across the Thames to Woolwich and continued to expand with much of the local population employed in the works with the area becoming known as Silvertown. Prior to becoming a limited company the manufacture of cable had been restricted to relatively short segments of the cable and core (the conductor and inner insulation). Silver's sons, Stephen William Silver and Hugh Adams Silver took over and expanded the business and began more work with submarine cable insulation becoming in 1863 Silver’s India Rubber Works & Telegraph Cable Company, Limited. In 1864 Charles Hancock joined in a merger of his West Ham Gutta Percha Company into Silver's company to form the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company. Charles Hancock, a younger brother of Thomas Hancock, was a founder of the Gutta Percha Company, but after a dispute with his partner he left to set up the rival West Ham Gutta Percha Company in 1850 with the support of his family.Haigh, Kenneth Richardson, Cableships and Submarine Cables, p. 26, Adlard Coles, 1968 . With Hancock's patents and experience in submarine cable manufacture the new company made full entry into the submarine cable manufacturing business while maintaining a profitable business ranging from making rubber bands to waterproof coats. Submarine cable The company entered the business of laying as well as manufacturing cables for other companies engaged in cable laying. In 1865 the company manufactured and laid its first cable for the Submarine Telegraph Company from Dover to Cap Gris Nez. In 1867 it manufactured and laid a cable linking Key West with Havana and Punta Rassa for the Florida based International Ocean Telegraph Company. The relationship with that Florida company resulted in cooperative founding of three new system operation companies, the West India and Panama Telegraph Company, the Cuba Submarine Telegraph Company and the Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Company. The company's cable ships and were used to lay the of cable for those three systems Both ships were engaged in some of the first oceanic surveys in examining cable routing for Spanish National Telegraph Company, with the Silver company being a major investor and contractor for cable and installation, cables from Cadiz to the Canary Islands. They made two zig-zag sounding lines gathering 552 soundings. After 1902 the company largely withdrew from cable manufacture but continued installing submarine cable until 1914 when only one cable ship, Dacia remained. Dacia was torpedoed 3 December 1916 by U-38 off Funchal, Madeira while diverting the German South American cable into Brest. U-38 sunk two other ships in this action and shelled Funchal with the British cable station as a primary target. The ship had previously repaired French cables and diverted German-African cables. The company withdrew from submarine cable work until 1922. Another ship, renamed , was acquired and modified for cable work that continued several years until that ship was sold to the Medway Steam Packet Company and the company's submarine cable work ceased. =Cable ships= CS Silvertown (ex Hooper) in 1901. Dacia and International were joined by two more ships as the cable laying business grew. , built by Hooper's Telegraph Works as the second specifically designed cable ship and first ship designed for transatlantic cable laying was second in size only to Great Eastern when built in 1873. Hooper was acquired in 1881 and renamed Silvertown.Built by C. Mitchell and Co., Newcastle, 1873, . Sold 1881 to India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company and renamed Silvertown which was active in cable work through 1913. Silvertown began the trans Pacific cable at San Francisco for the Commercial Pacific Cable Company in 1902. was built for the company as tender to Silvertown with two cable tanks but no cable laying machinery until a later refit when that machinery and bow sheaves were fitted. The last cable ship, replacing the torpedoed Dacia, was Silvergray purchased in 1922 which was in operation only a few years as a cable ship. Other business During the 1880s some of the first Bell’s patent telephones were manufactured at the Silvertown plant. The company by the 1890s was a supplier of electric generating plants to cities and towns both in the United Kingdom and on the Continent. Bicycle and later automobile tires were a major business segment in later years. By 1927 the company was in financial difficulty until the British Goodrich Rubber Company, itself a subsidiary of the B.F. Goodrich Company, acquired a controlling interest in 1933 and a year later the company's name was changed to British Tyre & Rubber Company.

Early life and education Myers was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Rufus King High School in 2002. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Alcorn State University in 2006 (from 2005-2006 she was National Membership Director of College Democrats of America), a Master of Education from Strayer University in 2009, and a doctor of education from Argosy University in 2016.

It replaced Builth Wells High School and Llandrindod High School and opened at the former schools' sites in September 2018. Background A decision to replace Builth Wells High School and Llandrindod High School was made by Powys County Council in September 2016 and confirmed in February 2017, despite the council receiving more than 1,700 letters of objection. Llandrindod High School, with 600 pupils, had been put into special measures in 2014 by the school inspection body, Estyn, but by the end of the 2017/18 academic year 74% of pupils attained at least five A*-C grades at GCSE. Builth Wells High School had seen 66% of its pupils attain at least five A*-C grades at GCSE in the 2016/17 year. £3.6 million was used in 2018 from the Welsh Government’s 21st Century Schools programme to improve the school facilities at the Llandrindod High School site. In February 2018 the new name for the school, Ysgol Calon Cymru, was announced, following consultation with staff and pupils at the secondary schools and their feeder primary schools. The new Ysgol Calon Cymru opened on the sites of its two predecessor secondary schools in September 2018, providing English-medium education on both sites and Welsh-medium education at the Builth Wells site. Leadership team In late 2017 the governors announced their appointment of Mrs Ionwen Spowage, former Head Teacher of Builth Wells High School to be that of Ysgol Calon Cymru, commencing inceptive work in January 2018. The full leadership team was agreed and announced shortly thereafter. At the beginning of 2019, the original headteacher announced that she was to become Head of Ysgol Bro Dinefwr in Carmarthenshire with effect from Easter.

Pannwitz was most notable for directing the investigation into the assassination of Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich on 27 May 1942 in Prague. In the last two years of the war, Pannwitz ran the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle, a Gestapo counterintelligence operation against the Red Orchestra espionage network. Life As a child, Pannwitz belonged to the Christliche Pfadfinderschaft Deutschlands scout association. As a youth Pannwitz was a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany but left due to divisions in the church over their stance towards Hitler and the Nazis. After completing his schooling, Pannwitz was employed as a fitter, but by 1931 was unemployed. Pannwitz then attended university to study theology and philosophy. Military career In February 1932, Pannwitz joined the Hitler Youth. In August 1933, Pannwitz joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) after the transfer of power to the Nazis, and transferred in 1939 to the Schutzstaffel (SS). In 1935, Pannwitz performed one year of military service in the Wehrmacht and was then discharged in the rank of Lieutenant. On 1 May 1937, he joined the Nazi Party. During 1936, Pannwitz successfully applied to join the police service at the Berlin Police Headquarters and joined the Berlin Police. On 10 September 1938, he became a criminal police detective with the Berlin Criminal Investigation Department, where he headed the \\"aggravated burglary\\" department. On September 1938, in accordance with the Munich Agreement, Germany annexed the Sudetenland. In March 1939, after the full occupation of Czechoslovakia, Pannwitz was transferred in July 1939 to Prague to be a Gestapo officer, assigned to Amt IV, section 2a of the Reich Main Security Office. In Prague, he was responsible for the Gestapo control room Unit IIa, which was responsible for investigating assassinations, illegal possession of weapons and sabotage. =Heydrich assassination= After the assassination attempt on Reinhard Heydrich, the Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor in Bohemia and Moravia and SS Obergruppenführer, on 27 May 1942 in Prague, Pannwitz was promptly ordered at the direction of a Special Commission to investigate the assassination of Heydrich. Pannwitz was the author of the official final report on the assassination. In September 1942, Pannwitz was promoted to Kriminalrat, equivalent to SS-Hauptsturmführer or SS-Sturmbannführer. As Pannwitz was not prepared to remove a Gestapo-critical passage from the report after submitting the official final report, he was heavily criticized by the Gestapo. In the autumn of 1942 Pannwitz was then transferred by acquaintances in the Abwehr to the Wehrmacht and was posted for several months as a Non- commissioned officer to the Eastern Front. =Red Orchestra= In the spring of 1943, Pannwitz was assigned to the State Police Headquarters in Berlin, working there for several months with the aim of investigating the Red Orchestra. From August 1943 until the spring of 1945, Pannwitz directed the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle operation in Paris and France, as a successor to Karl Giering. The Sonderkommando was a counterintelligence unit established by Gestapo to investigate and arrest the People of the Red Orchestra. After the Gestapo had managed to detect and unmask Glawnoje Raswedywatelnoje Uprawlenije agents in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, members of the Sonderkommando successfully attempted to bring some of the GRU's agents under their control, in effect turning them. The Sonderkommando used the discovered radio stations for playbacks, using a German radio team to control and send back disinformation to the Moscow information centre of the GRU and to obtain information about the Resistance in return. This procedure was coordinated with the head of the Gestapo in the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), Heinrich Müller. One of the groups that Pannwitz was trying to destroy in Belgium was the Trepper Group. Pannwitz used various members of the Trepper Group for playbacks, such as Hermann Isbutzki. Capture On 3 May 1945 Pannwitz was captured by French forces in a hut on a mountain near Bludenz, Vorarlberg, Austria, along with Anatoly Gurevich who was a double agent and who was previously a member of the Trepper Group. Both were taken to Paris to be interrogated and eventually turned over to Soviet authorities. Pannwitz believed that if he was turned over to the US he would face charges for War crimes, so instead opted to be sent instead to the Soviet Union. In Moscow all were immediately arrested and locked up in the Lubyanka. Pannwitz tried to justify his decisions to the Soviet interrogator Viktor Abakumov, who didn't believe that Pannwitz was running playbacks for almost two and a half years. Pannwitz offered his counterintelligence services to the Soviets for some time but nevertheless was eventually sentenced to 25 years in a Soviet Gulag for destroying the communist networks in Europe. Pannwitz was released early in 1954. In January 1956, after he was released, Pannwitz returned to Germany from the Soviet Union. CIA and Gehlen Organization Pannwitz returned to Germany with Friedrich Panzinger, a former SS officer who was also a Soviet agent. Panzinger's purposes in Germany were to penetrate the Gehlen organisation through his old Gestapo contacts. Panzinger's actions drew suspicion on Pannwitz from the Federal Intelligence Service (German:Bundesnachrichtendienst) (BND) who suspected that Pannwitz was also a Soviet agent. In August 1956, the BND organisation hired Pannwitz, perhaps to keep him away from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). Although the BND was planning to interrogate Pannwitz, who they considered a potentially important source, the BND failed to learn anything and, in turn, failed to send any reports to the CIA, as promised. Pannwitz through these proceedings seemed to be more concerned with money, insisting throughout his employment with the Gehlen Organization that his previous wartime Gestapo service as a Regierungsrat and his years in Soviet captivity should be recognised for pension purposes. By February 1958, Pannwitz had effectively achieved this. In 1959, the BND finally handed Pannwitz over to the CIA. Again Pannwitz put money first and tried to get a long-term contract instead of monthly payments. Essentially Pannwitz was not going to tell his story unless he was paid for it. By mid-1959, the CIA had completed debriefing and were satisfied that he was not a Soviet agent. The CIA noted that Pannwitz tried to portray the brutal and inhuman Gestapo in a favourable light. Pannwitz lived until his death with his wife in Ludwigsburg, where he worked as a sales representative. War crimes Pannwitz would have faced charges of war crimes at the end of the war had he stayed in Germany. The evidence for this involves the killing of Suzanne Spaak and part of her family. Spaak was a member of the French resistance and later the Trepper Group, who was arrested on 9 November 1943 in Brussels. After being tortured, in January 1944 Spaak was sentenced to death. Pannwitz ordered her to be killed when the liberation of Paris was only a few days away on August 1944. Spaak was shot by Pannwitz in her cell at Fresnes Prison. To hide his crimes he had the corpse buried in a cemetery at Cimetière parisien de Bagneux with the words A Belgian. At the same time, he sent a letter to Foreign Minister of the Belgian exile registry, Paul-Henri Spaak assuring him that his sister in law, Suzanne had been taken to Germany and was safe.

It topped the Italian charts for five weeks and led to Battisti's definitive affirmation as a composer. It is Notable for the innovative lyrics and sound heavily influenced by psychedelia, so much so that the song is nicknamed \\"Italy's Sergeant Pepper's\\" for the impact and the influence it had on the Italian music scene. In 1969, the song was reinterpreted by Battisti himself, and later by many other artists in Italy and abroad. It is one of the best-known songs both in Battisti's and in the Equipe 84 production, and is considered a classic of Italian pop music.  Lyrics and meaning  The lyrics, written by Mogol, tell the story of an adultery which lasts only one day and is made with lightness of mind, without consequences on the protagonist's other sentimental relationship. The story takes place over two consecutive days. In the first, the 29th of September, the protagonist meets a girl in a bar. Almost without realizing it, the two enter into intimacy and spend the whole night together, first at the restaurant and then dancing. The next day, the 30th of September, the protagonist wakes up animated by an unchanged love for his usual partner, so much that he rushes to phone her declaring his love, as if nothing had happened the night before. = Theme = Mogol, author of lyrics, in a 1968 photograph The central theme is adultery, a strongly innovative topic for the time. In the Italian society of the 1960s the subject was considered almost a taboo; in pop music, songs based on rosy and idealized loves prevailed, while adultery was almost always portrayed as a serious misconduct. The protagonist of 29 settembre, instead, shows no repentance and does not feel guilty when he returns to his partner; the passing of a single day erased everything, and the protagonist does not even remember the previous' night events. The message of 29 settembre, therefore, anticipates the sexual revolution which would become widespread on the next year with the Sessantotto movement. = Style = Also in its form and style, the lyrics were extremely innovative and almost experimental. The story told, in fact, is not a single episode (as almost always happened in the pop music of the time) but a complex story, which takes place in two days. Moreover, while maintaining chronological order, the lyrics have a relatively complex plot, which does not completely coincide with the course of events. The events of the first day are not told from a contemporary perspective, but are re-evoked by the protagonist when he wakes up, the next morning: in fact all events of September 29 use the verbal time of imperfect or passato remoto, while those of September 30 use present tense or at most passato prossimo. The song, therefore, takes place entirely on the day of September 30, but the initial part is occupied by a long flashback in which the previous day is recalled, returning in the present only at the end. The nature of flashback of the first day is also strengthened by the vague and muffled style with which the events are described, giving them the appearance of an undefined memory, which emerges with difficulty from the mind: the succession of events is indeed «swirling» and with very nuanced outlines, with many ellipses between one event and another. Some details of the story are markedly surreal and distorted, so much to resemble, according to Renzo Stefanel, the effects of an acid trip. The narrative is so blurred and surreal that the listener is kept with the doubt on whether the extramarital adventure really happened, or whether it was just a dream made before waking up. In this way psychedelia, until then a mostly musical topic, was brought by Mogol also in the lyrics sphere. = Title = According to declarations by the lyrics' author Mogol, the day in which the story takes place (and therefore the song title) is an ordinary day, which was chosen for no particular reason. However, it was noted that the date of September 29 coincides with the birthday of his wife of the time, Serenella;29 settembre, Mogol: \\"Una canzone moderna, il primo vero 'salto' di Lucio\\", Adnkronos Spettacolo this aspect could suggest an autobiographical nature of the text, almost a public confession of an infidelity made by the author. Mogol, however, argues that it was a coincidence, which he realized only one day after having written the lyrics. He said he regrets not having dedicated the song to her from the beginning, while his wife (who knew Mogol's proverbial inattention) understood that the tribute was not intentional and in fact did not thank him.  Composing  Lucio Battisti, the young author of music, still without his distinctive thick curly hair in a 1967 photo The song's composition probably dates back to the beginning of autumn of 1966. The song had a long gestation, and remained incomplete for a long time before it was finished. According to the testimony of musicologist Salvatore Galeazzo Biamonte, the song was composed with the precise will to overcome the classical schemes of the traditional song: At the time, Battisti still had to discover his own talent as a singer, and he was not fully affirmed even as a song author; for this reason, the song remained for some time within a repertoire that Battisti presented to bands and singers, looking for someone who would sing them. At first, during 1966, Battisti and Mogol proposed the song to Gianni Pettenati, but he was not entirely convinced and therefore refused to sing it. In February 1967, just after the end of Sanremo, Battisti resumed composing the song and finally completed it. Initially Battisti thought of interpreting the song in person: at that time, in fact, the musician (just at the beginning of his career as a singer) was starting to think about publishing a new single, to overcome the fiasco of previous year's debut single Per una lira. For this purpose, Battisti and Mogol had Mariano Detto listening the song, and asked him to make an arrangement; he immediately sensed its potential and immediately set to work.  Equipe 84 rendering  The song, however, also came to the ear of Maurizio Vandelli, leader of Equipe 84, who appreciated it very much and understood to be in front of a potential success: so Vandelli began to ask Mogol and Battisti to have the song for his band. Equipe 84 was at the peak of popularity at the time, and a short time before it was defined by John Lennon «the most up to date among Italian bands»; being the author of a song played by Equipe 84 would have given anyone great importance. So Battisti renounced to sing it personally and consented to hand it over, despite Mariano Detto insisted that it was the right song to launch his career as a singer. For the solo single, Battisti had to fall back on the two lesser known tracks Luisa Rossi and Era, which enjoyed little success. It was Battisti's first song to be played by Equipe 84, a partnership which subsequently continued with three more songs: Nel cuore, nell'anima, Ladro and Hey ragazzo. = Recording and production = An eight-track recorder of the time The song's artistic production was cared for by Vandelli himself. The recording took place in the Ricordi studios in Milan. A few weeks before the studio had been equipped with an eight-track recorder, the first ever in an Italian recording studio: so 29 settembre was the first song in Italy to be fully recorded with this new equipment. Vandelli gave much importance to sound research, which is why the recording of the song lasted a long time. Vandelli used the studio for so many hours that he angered Ricordi's executives, who complained about excessive costs. The song, at the time of recording, was still untitled. During the recording, it was decided to insert in the song the voiceover of a radio speaker who, while reading the news of the radio bulletin, pronounces the current date, making it easier to understand the chronology of the story told. It is not clear who had this idea: Maurizio Vandelli, Mogol, and Ricordi's production manager Paolo Ruggeri all took the credit. In the song Maurizio Vandelli played the guitar and solo voice, Alfio Cantarella the drums, Franco Ceccarelli the guitar and second voice, while Victor Sogliani the bass and second voice. The transfer was made on March 20, 1967. = Publishing = The song was published as a single in the last days of March 1967, in monophonic version, as the A-side of a 7″ vinyl disc which had È dall'amore che nasce l'uomo in the B-side. The cover picture, which also featured a psychedelic atmosphere, was shot by Mario Schifano. In October 1968, the song was included in the album Stereoequipe, where it was released for the first time in stereophonic version. = Critical and commercial reception = The single reached the number one of Italian hit parade in May 1967 and stayed there for five weeks. The song became the winner of the contest issued by RAI's popular radio broadcast Bandiera gialla (\\"yellow flag\\"), and was hence honoured by the \\"yellow record\\". = English version = In 1967 Equipe 84 recorded an English version of the song titled 29th September, with lyrics translated by Tommy Scott. It was published on 45 rpm single in the United Kingdom and the United States, to weak success; it was republished only in 2008, within the compilation Let's Ride dedicated to the European psychedelic scene. = Videoclip = Equipe 84 played the song using lip sync inside the 1967 musicarello movie I ragazzi di Bandiera Gialla. The video, directed by Mariano Laurenti, is in color and is set in a bar on the shore of Laghetto dell'Eur in Rome.  Lucio Battisti's rendering  At the beginning of 1969, Battisti, who was now beginning to establish himself as a singer, decided to record his own version of the song, to include it in his debut album Lucio Battisti. = Recording = Battisti recorded his version mostly at Sax Records studios in Milan. Sessions took place on January 13, 1969 from 9 to 14:30, on January 17 from 15 to 18:30, on January 22 from 9 to 13; the rhythm tracks were recorded on January 23 from 9 to 13:30, while vocals and overdubs on January's last week. At last, in February, overdubs of strings and horns were added in the Ricordi studios in Milan. The transfer took place on February 21, 1969. = Music = Battisti gave a more \\"classical\\" and less experimental interpretation than Equipe 84's version. First of all, he removed the voiceover radio news announcer, a strongly innovative element in the Equipe's version, which was considered no longer necessary (since the story told was now widely known to the public and there was no need to make its understanding easier). The choice of musical instruments is also more traditional: the arrangement consists of a tangle of guitars, bass and flutes, while there is no drum at all. According to Renzo Stefanel, Battisti's version is psychedelic too, but is inspired by Buffalo Springfield, Peter, Paul and Mary and Tyrannosaurus Rex rather than Byrds and Love who inspired the Equipe's version. The main innovation is Battisti's vocal performance, which in the opinion of Stefanel is superior to Maurizio Vandelli's one. In particular, the last two verses, in which the protagonist is laughing on the phone, are interpreted by Battisti in an extremely expressive way, rippling the singing with a forced laugh, which transposes into music the meaning of lyrics. Strings and brasses, at first discrete, later acquire a more important role, and finally result in an instrumental coda which closes the track. According to Stefanel, the coda throws an ambiguous light on the mood of the protagonist, leaving open if the return with his partner is really happy or actually forced. = Publishing = Battisti's rendering was published on March 5, 1969 in the eponymous LP Lucio Battisti, his debut album as a singer. Since then it has been republished countless times in collections, compilations and best-ofs. = Live performances = Battisti sang live a hint of the song in his April 15, 1969 appearance in RAI's television program Speciale per voi and in full in radio transmission Per voi giovani in December 1971, in both cases accompanied by the acoustic guitar. The song was also often performed during his summer tour of 1969.  Other renderings  Over time, the song has been reinterpreted by many other artists: * Mario Battaini covered it in 1967 * Gianni Nazzaro, under the nickname of Buddy, covered it in 1967 * Mina recorded a cover in her 1975 album Minacantalucio, with an arrangement written by Gabriel Yared. * Maurizio Vandelli recorded a new version in 1989, with a new arrangement written by Pino Santapaga, publishing it in the album 29 settembre 89. With this version Vandelli participated and won the first edition of the revival television program Una rotonda sul mare; the song was therefore included in the show's compilation Una rotonda sul mare vol. 2. * Dik Dik recorded a cover in 1989, released in the album Canta Battisti Cantaitalia. * British psychedelic band The Bevis Frond recorded an English-language cover in 1993, titled 29th September, releasing it as the B-side of a single titled Let's live for today published by Helter Skelter records. * Equipe 84 published a live version in the 1995 album In concerto. * Supergroup Adelmo e i suoi Sorapis (composed of Zucchero Fornaciari, Pooh's Dodi Battaglia, Equipe 84's Maurizio Vandelli, Nomadi's Umberto Maggi, Fio Zanotti and Michele Torpedine) covered the song live in 1997. * Ornella Vanoni covered the song in 2001, releasing it in her album Un panino una birra e poi..., with an arrangement written by Mario Lavezzi and Carlo Gargioni. * Pianist Enrico Pieranunzi recorded a jazz, instrumental version of the song in 2004, releasing it in the album Battisti in jazz.

It began at 11:00 JST and finished at approximately 14:00 JST. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture and history. The Games were officially opened by Emperor of Japan Akihito. Alan Tomlinson, Professor in Leisure Studies at the University of Brighton, argues that the main theme of this opening ceremony is Peace and Harmony. While elements of Nagano's religious and sporting culture are shown throughout the ceremony, it is shown along side examples of world peace at the end of the 20th century. Officials and Guests * International Olympic Committee - IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and María Teresa Salisachs Rowe * United Nations - Secretary General Kofi Annan * Japan - NAOC President Eishiro Saito, Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko * Luxembourg - Grand Juke Jean * Monaco - Sovereign Prince Rainier III * Norway - Crown Prince Haakon * United States - Second Lady Tipper Gore, Founder of International Campaign to Ban Landmines and American political activist - Jody Williams * South Korea - Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil * Belarus - President Aleksander Lukashenko * Belgium - IOC Member Jacques Rogge Proceedings =Bell to Symbolize Purification= At exactly 11am JST, a bell at Zenkō-ji temple was rung, by a man who was a teenager during World War II, and was in training to be a kamikaze pilot when the war ended. The bell that was rung was cast in 1667, and reverberates as a symbol of Nagano. It was rung to confer blessing on the opening ceremony. Then, the announcer states that Nagano has been linked with the five continents, though satellite links. There is a choir waiting at each satellite location. Three of these locations are used to symbolize major peaceful resolutions in the 1990's: * Brandenburg Gate, Berlin - symbolizing the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1991, * Sydney Opera House, Sydney * United Nations General Assembly Hall, New York City - symbolizing international peace, * Forbidden City, Beijing * False Bay Cape Point, South Africa - a multi-racial choir is shown symbolizing the end of the South African Apartheid. =Raising of Onbashira to Consecrate Sacred Ground= Onbashira — or \\"sacred pillars\\" in the Japanese — are large wooden fir posts which stand at the corners of local shrines in Nagano Prefecture. They are brought down from the surrounding mountains to purify the earth. At this ceremony, we see hundreds of people perform the Satobiki ceremony, where four 12 meter high onbashira are erected at two entrances of the stadium. The logs are raised with ropes by hand, and while they are being raised, a ceremonial group of log bearers ride the logs and sing and perform other feats, while numerous men and women sustain a consistent chant. Barry Davies — the commentator for the BBC broadcast showing stated that the chants were \\"plaintive\\" being a \\"prelude to much hard work.\\" Finally, each post unfurled a yellow steamer which were to call the gods that lived in the trees. =The Dohyo-iri Ceremony= 33 Sumo Wrestlers across Japan enter the stadium to perform their an ring-entry ceremony, one that can be traceable back to an 8th century text. Then Akebono Tarō, eight-time Sumo Grand Champion, and 38 other wrestlers also enter the stadium, totaling the 72 wrestlers. The Emperor of Japan Akihito, and his wife, Empress Michiko arrive with IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and other dignitaries. Then Akebono performed the dohyo-iri ring purification ceremony, the symbolic calling of the attention of the gods and expelling the evil spirits from the competition venue. =The Children of Nagano Welcome the Athletes= Giant straw Dōsojin, which appear in Shinto folklore in Ōoka village arrive in the stadium. 150 primary school aged children, local participants of the \\"One School, One Country\\" initiative, arrive dressed as Yukinko, traditional straw winter coats and hats. After some dancing, the children take off their straw coats, showing knitted sweaters of country flags representing the 72 nations competing in these Winter Games. Each child will march with their country during the Parade of Nations, and will appear also during the lighting of the Olympic Flame. Japanese artist Ryoko Moriyama and primary school children perform When Children Rule the World from the 1996 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Whistle Down the Wind. It is performed in both Japanese and English. =Parade of Nations= 2,302 athletes from 72 countries and regions participated in the competition, including 814 female athletes and 1488 male athletes. Both the number of participating delegations and the number of athletes participating in the competition were the most ever at the time. At this Olympics, Uruguay, Azerbaijan and Macedonia had their largest grouping in the history of the Winter Olympics. =Opening Addresses= NAOC President Eishiro Saito delivered a speech in Japanese, welcoming everyone. IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch delivered a speech in English. The Emperor of Japan Akihito declared the Games of the XVIII Winter Olympic in Nagano open in Japanese. =The Olympic Flag= The Olympic Flag was carried around the stadium by eight former Japanese Olympians: Chiharu Igaya, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, Yoshihiro Kitazawa, Hatsue Nagakubo- Takamizawa, Yuko Otaka, Seiko Hashimoto, and Hiromi Yamamoto. During the raising of the Olympic flag, the Olympic Hymn was sung in Japanese by the Nagano Children's Choir. =Anthem= The Japanese National Anthem, Kimigayo, was played by Gagaku. =Torch relay and the lighting of the Olympic Flame= The cauldron used during the games is now used as a monument to the games. At the end of a 49-day torch relay across Japan, the Olympic flame is carried into the stadium by Chris Moon, an Landmine Survivors Network member and an advocate for banning anti-personnel landmines. He is accompanied by the local Nagano children featured earlier wearing their flag sweaters. There is also a reprise of the theme song, When Children Rule the World. Moon passes and hand over the Olympic torch to and Masako Chiba, bronze medalist for the Women's 10,000 metres at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics in Athens. Chiba passes the torch to Takanori Kono, Masashi Abe, and Reiichi Mikata for the Nordic Combine team, then Hiromi Suzuki, winner of the Women's marathon who runs upstairs while surounded by local Nagano children. The last torchbearer is Midori Ito, Olympic silver medalist of the Ladies' singles at the Figure skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and champion of the 1989 World Figure Skating Championships, who lights the cauldron. The music played during this sequence is Un bel dì, vedremo aria from the opera Giacomo Puccini's \\"Madama Butterfly\\". =Olympic Oaths= Japanese men's Nordic combined skier Kenji Ogiwara took the oath on behalf of all 1998 Olympic athletes in Japanese, while the officials' oath was taken by figure skating referee Junko Hiramatsu in Japanese. =1,998 Dove Balloons= 1,998 balloons in the shape of doves were released from the stage of the stadium. =A Choral Performance Linking Five Continents= The Ceremony closes with Ozawa Seiji from Nagano Prefectural Culture Hall conducting Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, 4th Movement (Ode to Joy). He conducts the Nagano Winter Orchestra, Soloists, a local Chorus as well has choruses from the five satellite locations shown at the beginning of the ceremony: Brandenburg Gate, Berlin Sydney Opera House, Sydney United Nations General Assembly, New York City Forbidden City, Beijing and False Bay Cape Point, South Africa. There are also 81 Ballet dancers in the stadium, and the audience also joins in with the singing. The ceremony concludes with five Kawasaki T-4 planes fly in formation overhead the stadium in the Olympic colors. Performers Nagano Prefectural Culture Hall: Ozawa Seiji, Tokyo Opera Singers, Nagano Winter Orchestra. Sopranos: Izabela Labuda, Claudia Waite, Altos: Zheng Cao, Ruth Peel, Tenors: Anthony Dean Griffey, Gwyn Hughes Jones, Baritones: Denis Sedov, Kevin Short. The Five Choirs * Berlin: Ernst Senff Choir * Sydney: Sydney Philharmonia Choirs * New York: Boston Symphony Tanglewood Festival Chorus * Bejing: China National Symphony Orchestra Chorus * Cape Town: Harmony Singers, Princess Square Singers, The Philharmonia Choir of Cape Town Anthems * Nagano City Children's Choir – Olympic Hymn * Gagaku - National Anthem of Japan Legacy Alan Tomlinson, argues that Peace and Harmony is this opening ceremony's theme. While elements of Nagano's culture are shown throughout the ceremony, the main theme shown is how the world is more unified and harmonious at the last Winter Olympics of the 20th century. This is best seen in the massed choir that marked the beginning and the end of this ceremony, with satellite choirs at key symbolic locations of peace. It is also seen through at the flame's entrance by emphasizing the work of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Since 2000, the theme of universalism bringing peace in Olympic opening ceremonies have been dropped for more nationalistic displays, as seen in the 2002 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, which took place five months after September 11.

She was one of the first female film producers, and she was also a political organizer noted for her extreme far- right views.  Early life  Curtis was born in Albany, New York, to wealthy parents George Taylor (a capitalist) and Flora Beach, Curtis attended boarding school in New York City and graduated from St. Agnes High School in Albany. She attended New York University but left before graduating.  Career  Curtis owned and operated a ranch in Phoenix, Arizona. She began investing in stocks at the age of 15. In Phoenix, one of her neighbors was novelist Harold Bell Wright, who invited her to Hollywood to play a role in his film, The Shepherd of the Hills. = Hollywood career = While working on the film, she decided she wanted to become a producer, and she decided to stay in Los Angeles. Her first credit as a producer was on King Vidor's 1921 silent film The Sky Pilot. She planned an adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (ultimately released in 1925), but legal wrangling ensued over rights. She was noted as one of the only film producers of her day, and was notable for being the first woman in that position. Curtis ran her own production company, The Cathrine Curtis Pictures Corporation. Created in 1919, the company had offices in New York City and Los Angeles. She seems to have lost interest after marrying her husband Joseph O'Neill but continued making advertorial films through the end of the decade. = Political leanings = After moving back to New York City after the stock market crash, she continued investing and became a radio personality, producing a twice-weekly show, Women and Money, for WMCA, where she began espousing a brand of feminism centered around women's financial independence. Her criticism of the New Deal eventually led to cancellation of the program. Curtis was also a far-right activist and organizer known for her anti-Communist stance, antisemitism, and isolationist views. She created a number of committees and organizations in her day, including the National Legion of Mothers of America and the Women's National Committee to Keep the U.S. Out of War. Her criticism of the New Deal and lobbying on behalf of women investors led her to create the Women Investors Research Institute, a non-profit organization that grew to 300,000 members in 1939.

A. californica often grows as colonies of flat rosettes of light green, rigid thalli, with undersides dark wine-red to nearly black. The receptacles are rounded, with four lobes each bearing a single sporangium sheathed by a white tattered skirt. A. californica is dioecious with separate male plants often intermingled with female plants. This species is found throughout California from San Francisco southward to San Diego and Guadalupe Island. Asterella californica is the commonest species of the three species of Asterella occurring in California; the other two species are A. bolanderi and A. palmeri.  Description  Plants are pale green dorsally with purple ascending margins and dark purple undersides, thallus edges tending to curl upward exposing the dark underside when dry. Thalli are simple or somewhat sparingly dichotomous, 8–25 mm long, usually 1-3 times dichotomous, the ultimate segments emarginated, obovate, obcordate, or broadly oblong, indistinctly areolate, 4–12 mm in maximum width. The plants dry up during the long rainless summers, but the ends of the branches remain alive, so that each growing tip becomes the beginnings of a new plant. It was found that a surprisingly large amount of the thallus remains alive, and within a few hours after the dried plants are supplied with water, the forward part of the thallus has assumed its active condition and begins to grow. In Asterella the first antheridia were mature in about two weeks. This early development of the reproductive organs raised the question whether they might not begin their development before the close of the growing period in the spring.  Reproduction  = Male plants = Antheridia are clearly circumscribed, slightly elevated, strongly papillate, oval to linear-oblong, sometimes forked discs, situated in the median line of the thallus at some distance back from the apex. While working on male individuals in his laboratory George Pierce observed, then measured, antherozoids–packets of ciliated sperm cells and encasing slime–being \\"forceably ejected\\" from the thallus. One may say, then, that Asterella can throw its antherozoids, under favorable conditions, to a vertical height of 14–20 cm. Macro image of male Asterella californica showing antheridia = Female plants = Each \\"umbrella\\", or archegoniophore, is clearly visible raised above the thallus of mature female plants is not itself a sporophyte but is in fact gametophyte tissue. The part of the \\"umbrella\\" at the top of the stem is called the female receptacle or carpocephalum. The receptacle is initially on the thallus surface and the stalk grows to raise it. The archegonia are found on the female receptacle and initially they are in the upper surface and face upward. They are fertilized when the stem is still fairly short. The stem continues to grow and the receptacle continues to grow by centrally added tissue. This moves the fertilized archegonia outward and the receptacle eventually folds over to orient the developing sporophytes so that they face down. Peduncle straw-colored sometimes with a brown or purplish pigmentation, 1–3 cm high. Disk of receptacle green, about 5 mm across, low-hemispherical, deeply lobed, almost smooth, the lobes mostly 4 (sometimes 5). = Sporophyte = Capsule circumscissile at the middle or above by an irregular line, the operculum breaking up into fragments. Spores yellow, mostly 100 to 120 µm in diameter, with wavy wings 12-20 µm wide along the edges, the surface covered over more or less completely with a fine and often irregular reticulum with meshes 3-4 µm across. Elaters yellow variously curved, mostly 240-450 µm long and 12-16 µm wide. The yellow spores with their distinct marginal wings, fine surface reticulation, and sparesly developed ridges on the faces are also very distinctive of the species.  Taxonomy  In 1810 Palisot de Beauvais established the genus Asterella, but in 1820 Nees established the genus Fimbriaria in error. The genus name Fimbriaria was used by Bolander in his catalogue of plants growing in the vicinity of San Francisco in 1870, but it is antedated by Asterella. The genus name means \\"little star\\" in reference to the star-like appearance of pores in the thallus of some species as viewed from above.  Distribution and habitat  Asterella californica is widespread and common on lightly shaded slopes and banks and around rock outcrops, mostly in oak forest, chaparral on desert scrub, mostly below 3000 feet (but to 7000 feet in San Bernardino County). A. californica occurs throughout the Coast Ranges, western Klamath Ranges, Sacramento Valley, west slope of the Sierra Nevada, coastal Southern California and the Channel Islands, Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, western Colorado Desert; east to Arizona, north to southwestern Oregon, and south to northern Baja California.

They expressed the view that English Canadian and French Canadian film were two different domains which could not be directly compared against each other in the same categories but instead needed to each have their own selection criteria and even their own separate awards, and criticized the funding processes of organizations such as the Canadian Film Development Corporation, the National Film Board of Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The directors chose to protest even though the awards had been scheduled to be presented in Montreal.\\"A wake for Canadian cinema\\". The Globe and Mail, October 13, 1973. Although the directors stated that they intended their letter as a \\"quiet\\" gesture, it had an explosive impact; the Canadian Film Award gala scheduled for October 12 was cancelled, with the winners of the awards announced only at a press conference, and the awards were entirely cancelled in 1974, with the 26th Canadian Film Awards not taking place until 1975. Producers and film distributors from Quebec, conversely, dissociated themselves from the directors' move. Despite the boycott, several of the boycotting directors' films were named as winners, although Carle's win of the Wendy Michener Award, for \\"outstanding contribution to the Canadian Film Awards and the Canadian film industry\\", was booed in the theatre.\\"No wonder there're no prizes for Bucheron\\".

Defensive communication is a communicative behavior that occurs within relationships, work environments, and social groups when an individual reacts in a defensive manner in response to a self-perceived flaw or a threat from outsiders. Defensive responses can be triggered by external events and by feelings of anxiety, insecurity, and sensitivity, and often occurs in circumstances where people feel negatively evaluated, controlled, or persuaded by others. Sigmund Freud was one of the first scientists to research the subject of defensive communication in depth, during his development of psychodynamic theory. Defensiveness creates inefficient and damaging communication in social interactions when people deny their flaws, project their flaws on others, or use judgmental communication techniques. Also people affected by this tend to have bigger spaces between their ears.  History  Sigmund Freud Psychodynamic Theory Psychodynamics is the study of the psychological forces that underlie human behavior. Sigmund Freud's work on psychodynamic theory was the foundation of research into defensive communication. Freud and his colleagues believed that internal emotions such as anxiety, guilt, and insecurities created defensive reactionary behaviors. Psychodynamic theorists also believe defensiveness is a reactionary response to protect oneself from external threats. Defensive Climate Conceptualization In 1961, Gibb developed a conceptual framework for categorizing communication into defensive and supportive behaviors. The defensive behaviors include evaluation, control, strategy, neutrality, superiority, and certainty. The supportive behaviors, in contrast, include description, problem orientation, spontaneity, empathy, equality, and provisionalism. Individuals respond either defensively or in a supportive manner based on their own perceptions of the communicative climates. For example, communication perceived as evaluative will increase defensiveness in the listener, due to the perception that the communicator is judging the listener. Descriptive communication, such as requests for information that are perceived to be genuine, does not initiate the same defensive response.  Defensiveness in social interaction  Defensive communication in social interaction is hypothesized to be related to a self-perceived flaw, attacks from others, or a focus on an attack on flaws of others. In this hypothesis, which combines insights from psychodynamics and Gibb’s defensive climate conceptualization, defensive reactions can be triggered by either internal and external forces. Internally, perceptions of sensitive internal flaws such as personality traits can trigger defensive responses. Externally, defensive communication occurs when people perceive an attack or other threat. Defensive communication is a relational construct (a subjective worldview) that arises as a result of internal individual perceptions.  Applications  Defensiveness in the Workplace Defensive communication is common in the workplace due to the environment frequently being perceived as evaluative, judgmental, manipulative, or autocratic. Research indicates defensive reactions in the workplace cause inefficiency in communication and potential burnout. Much of the communication in a workplace is between managers and subordinates, increasing the need for efficient and supportive communication strategies. Defensiveness in Romantic Relationships Romantic relationships create four contextual conditions for defensive communication: self-perceptions of flaws, situational difficulties, emotional difficulties, and relational concerns. Research shows that people are sensitive not only about their own perceived flaws, but also about the flaws of those close to them. Emotion can also intensify perception of flaws and threats from others. Jealousy, anxiety, and uncertainty can also elicit defensive communication behavior, and lack of supportive communication, lack of communicative warmth, lack of communicative sharing, and lack of attentiveness are all triggers of defensive communication. Defensive communication in relationships can be damaging and can lead to increased arguments, uncertainty, and stress. Defensiveness in Family Environments Defensive communication can occur in family environments and can consist of verbal and nonverbal behaviors that are threatening and/or punishing to others. This type of communication will frequently invite defensive behaviors in return. Behavior like this will promote a \\"defensive climate\\" as defined by Gibb. Children raised in atmospheres with high defensiveness and low amounts of supportive communication tend to develop aggressive behaviors.  Critique  A central criticism of defensive communication is the lack of empirical research supporting Gibb’s initial paper on the topic. Gibb’s paper on the climate conceptualization of defensiveness was not a scientific study and did not allow other researchers to replicate or test his hypothesis.

He fought against Caliph Ali () at the Battle of the Camel and later moved to Damascus where he was a courtier of the Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I () and Yazid I (). He was appointed governor of Palestine by Abd al-Malik and is credited in an inscription for building part of a road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem in 692. He served as governor of Medina for a year in 694/95 and afterward led a series of expeditions against the Byzantine Empire along the northern frontier of Syria. Life Yahya was a son of al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As and a younger half-brother of Caliph Marwan I (r. 684–685).Sharon 1966, p. 371.Madelung 1997, p. 190, note 225. His mother hailed from the Banu Murra tribe of Ghatafan. He fought alongside Marwan and their brother Abd al-Rahman and other senior leaders of the Quraysh against Caliph Ali () at the Battle of the Camel in 656. Ali was victorious and Yahya, wounded, found safety with a member of the large Banu Tamim tribe in Basra. This tribesman escorted him to the headquarters of his distant cousin, the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, in Damascus. He stayed in the city through the course of Mu'awiya's caliphate (661–680) and that of his son and successor, Yazid I (). Yahya publicly condemned the slaying of Ali's son and the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson, Husayn, by Yazid's army at the Battle of Karbala in 680. At some point between 685 and 694, Yahya's nephew, the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (), appointed him the governor of Palestine.Crone 1980, p. 125.

In 697/98, he led a campaign against the Byzantine fortress at Marj al-Shahm.Rowson 1989, pp. 176, 181. This may have occurred in 698/699. Yahya died prior to 700. His tombstone, which in Kufic Arabic script reads \\"May my Lord have mercy on Yahya ibn al-Hakam and forgive him\\" was found in Katzrin in the Golan Heights.Sharon 2004, pp. 230–232. Family and descendants One of Yahya's wives during his governorship of Medina was Umm al-Qasim al-Sughra, a daughter of a leading companion of Muhammad, Abd al- Rahman ibn Awf. A son of Yahya, Yusuf, served as governor of Mosul toward the end of Abd al-Malik's reign, and his son al-Hurr and grandson Yahya ibn al- Hurr each served terms in the province in 727–732 and 732, respectively.Robinson, pp. 152–153.

It opened with 300 students. More than half of the students were black and fewer than half were white.

In an opinion article Wanda Jackson, a Washington, DC resident who originated from Sumter County, stated that there were earlier integrated schools.

Background Prior to 1970s schools in Sumter County were by law, and later de facto, racially segregated. Even though the Sumter County School District was ordered to de facto desegregate by the federal courts system in 1970, white families had immediately moved their children to Sumter Academy, a segregation academy, leaving the public schools majority black. \\\\- This article includes statements by Nettles, citing the Tuscaloosa News article, linking his statements to the establishment of the charter school.

The HCRH created numerous conferences, texts, actions, editorial projects, music, radio programs and artworks that utilize a highly ironic and intellectual language for \\"ridiculing the hollow pomposity of institutional culture.\\" The public art activities of the HCRH, in festivals for example, were produced between 1996 and 2004, a period in which globalization and neoliberal politics in Mexico were incipient and the market-driven art world was consolidated. Its work has been shown at various venues including: Museo Jumex, Mexico City; Havana Biennial, Cuba; Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam; CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco; National Centre of Contemporary Arts, Moscow; Museo Carrillo Gil, Mexico City; Centre d’Art Santa Monica, Barcelona; Ex-Teresa, Mexico City; Americas Society, New York; Museo Tamayo, Mexico City; among others. In 1999, the HCRH created one of its more notable actions: The Universal Destitution Campaign, which consisted of a letter sent by fax to several Mexican political and cultural personalities, ordering them to abandon their posts on the grounds of unsatisfactory performance. The extensive list of recipients included presidential candidates, politicians, social activists, artists, writers, art critics and journalists.The campaign ended up with officials from the Ministry of Interior visiting the HCRH members' homes. Another campaign by the HCRH was the massive distribution of stickers (1998-1999) in Mexico City that read, \\"When injustice is law, resistance is a must.\\" In 2002, the ephemeral and phantasmagoric nature of their work materialized in an image of the HCRH logo, drawn with salt on the entrance floor of the Carrillo Gil Museum, and which the passage of visitors and workers of the museum blurred as they stepped in.\\" For the 7th Havana Biennial (2000) the HCRH created a free ice cream distribution project, as well as the distribution of hundreds of books, among them: Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and 1984 by George Orwell. The HCRH also organized several academic conferences with fictitious international scholars in different universities and museums --such as Universidad Iberoamericana, Universidad Intercontinental, Museo Rufino Tamayo and Faculty of Arts and Design (formerly known as the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas or ENAP). They also created numerous fictional radio programs that were transmitted on XEUN-FM, the radio station of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. While the work of the HCRH is mostly intangible and ephemeral, they created a number of architectural drawings and blueprints for fictional urbanization plans, such as the Children Vineyard (a chain of orphanages built along the Northern Hemisphere wine regions), the Payoff Memorial, the Air Crash Memorial (as part of the 1998 project NY AWAKE: \\"long before the collapse of the twin towers, 'monuments unequivocally indicate that Man learns from his own history, and —contrary to popular belief— he enjoys repeating it\\") and The Museum of Good (2003). Conceptualized as a spherical building, The Museum of Good is a two-faced institution. In one side, everything that throughout human history may be considered as culturally good and kind it's collected and exhibited. In the other side, all things considered as shameful and ignominious are represented.The fictitious architectural model refers to the dual character of cultural institutions, not only as places of knowledge, but also as systems that operate according to political and cultural ideologies, occasionally financed by questionable corporations, for which art serves as a tool to achieve political and economical aims. The Museum of Good was last exhibited in 2016 at the Jumex Museum. In 2019, the monograph HCRH: Septuagésimo Aniversario 1947-2017 was published by Alumnos 47 Foundation.

The term comes from the Arabic verb qaṣṣa, meaning \\"to recount\\". The qāṣṣ was essentially a popular storyteller and the reputation among Islamic scholars of the early quṣṣāṣ has generally been that of \\"second-rate religious figures lingering on the fringes of Islamic orthodoxy and even, at times, contributing directly to the corruption of the faith\\". In actuality, the quṣṣāṣ varied from serious Qurʾānic exegetes to outright charlatans. According to al-Maqrīzī, writing in the fifteenth century, there was a distinction between the private qāṣṣ and the official qāṣṣ. The office was instituted by the Caliph Muʿāwiya I. So far the only traces found of these official quṣṣāṣ come from Egypt. There the office was typically held by a qāḍī (judge). His job was to denounce the enemies of Islam after the morning prayer each day and to explain the Qurʾān after the khuṭba on Fridays. The official qāṣṣ was replaced in the tenth century by the wāʿiẓ and the mudhakkir.

It is his first book, published in October 2018 by Rocky Mountain Books.  Background  The book is based on self-propelled wilderness expeditions Wolf has undertaken in North America, Scandinavia, and Asia. It has 24 chapters, each representing a different expedition or 'line on a map', that Wolf completed between 1995 and 2017. 16 of the chapters are from previously published articles in Explore (magazine), Westjet Magazine, Sea Kayaker Magazine, Action Asia Magazine, Wend Magazine, Paddler magazine, River Magazine, Adventure Kayak Magazine, and Canoeroots Magazine. The other eight chapters are previously unpublished. The foreword for the book was written by acclaimed author and journalist John Vaillant. Overview The book opens with an overview map of North America, Scandinavia, and Asia, showing the wilderness areas where each of the 24 chapters in the book take place. Each individual chapter opens with a detail map showing the route written about in that particular chapter. There is also a section of 77 colour photographs from the various journeys included. Some of the stories covered in the chapters include: two friends on a cycling and volcano-climbing odyssey across Java, the most populous island in the world’s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia, in the wake of 9/11; a surreal private lunch with former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau during an 8000 km canoe journey across Canada; discovering the past and present on a 900 km hiking and kayaking journey from Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson City, Yukon; negotiating the cultural divide during a whitewater paddling expedition in Laos and Cambodia with Russian extreme kayakers; exploring the nature and politics of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines in northern BC by hiking, biking and kayaking the GPS track of the proposed project route from the oil sands to the British Columbia coast; conducting a mammal tracking survey in the course of a 120 km ski traverse of Banff National Park; discovering the truth about the existence of Sasquatch in northern Ontario; retracing Viking history during a canoe trip across Scandinavia.

Phylogeny  Cyanea annaskala is in the scyphozoan class of the phylum Cnidaria. The scyphozoans are the true jellies. It is within the order Semaeostomeae. The Semaeostomeae are the flag mouth jellies. It is within the family Cyaneidae, which contain the better known species of the lion's mane jellyfish.Browne, J., 2011, Lion's Mane Jellyfish, Cyanea annaskala, in Taxonomic Toolkit for marine life of Port Phillip Bay, Museum Victoria, accessed 16 Apr 2019, http://portphillipmarinelife.net.au/species/7761 The phylogeny of the Lion's mane jellyfish has long been debated since their discovery, and the Cyanea Annaskala has long been implicated in this difficulty. The high proportion of cosmopolitan species in pelagic individuals makes it extremely tedious to differentiate between closely related members. Because of limited study and challenging experimentation, not all of the Cyanea species from the North Atlantic are considered valid.Sabine Holst, Silke Laakmann, Morphological and molecular discrimination of two closely related jellyfish species, Cyanea capillata and C. lamarckii (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa), from the northeast Atlantic, Journal of Plankton Research, Volume 36, Issue 1, January/February 2014, Pages 48–63, https://doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbt093 Protein and medusae analysis from Michael N. Dawson of the University of New South Wales confirm that Cyanea Annaskala is a valid species, morphologically distinct based on differences in bell mass, number of nematocyst clusters, pits in coronal muscle folds, and other morphological characteristics. Some of the other morphological characteristics that have been compared include the number of coronal and radial muscle folds, and the depth of primary and secondary marginal clefts. The distinguishing of C. Annaskala from C. capillata and C. rosea is justified as robust based on these criterion. There are two subspecies which include C. Annaskala purpurea and C. Annaskala margarina. These are located in Port Philips and Port Jackson respectively. Purpurea are purple throughout whereas margarina are only purple at the free margin. Morphology and ecology The bell of the Cyanea annaskala has 8 lobes, all of which have a central cleft. A distinguishing characteristic is the purple coloration of the arms that runs length wise throughout. The bell width is usually between 25 cm and 1 m Their oral arms usually have a base that is not thickened, between 17-24 shallow coronal muscle folds, and no pits in their muscle folds Cyanea annaskala are endemic to the waters of South Eastern Australia, spanning depths from shallow waters close to the shore to 20 m below the surface. They are in particularly high concentration in Port Philip Bay in Victoria and Port Jackson in Sydney, New South Wales. They are carnivorous and eat small fish and crustaceans. They will often dive downwards to fan out their tentacles to increase surface area and consequently their chances of catching prey. Being cnidarians, they do possess distinctive harpoon-like injection stinging cells, and like many scyphozoans their populations get out of control. They will occasionally wash ashore and cause minor stings to beachgoers.Browne, J. (2018) Cyanea annaskala Lion's Mane Jellyfish in Museums Victoria Collections https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/species/8682 During the summer of 1950 and 1961, 4 young men were stung in the eyes while swimming in Port Phillip Bay during a C. Annaskala infestation. They experienced severe pain, swelling, and temporary visual deterioration.Mitchell, J. Eye injuries due to jellyfish (Cyanea annaskala). Med J Aust. 1962; 2: 303 Link:https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(02)70634-0/fulltext They also experienced photophobia and blepharospasm. Corneal epithelium suffered abrasions and stroma were punctured. There was also an infestation during the 1997-1998 summer and swimmers were warned to stay out of the waters by the Victorian Environmental Protection Authority after hundreds of reported stingings! These blooms can be quite destructive to the trophic structure of the surrounding environment. Reproduction The gonads of the C. annaskala have been described as folded into a ribbon in a genital band. The stretched out gonadial ribbon reached 300 mm. Epithelial cavities will make chambers which fuse to become a genital sinus. Spermatozoa are formed in follicles which stay connected to the genital sinus, providing a conduit for the spermatozoa to travel. The fertilized egg becomes a polyp which is produced through the process of budding (strobilation). The polyp like stage (known as a scyphistoma) of development starts out as a coronate scyphistoma. It then becomes a semaeostome, followed by a rhizostome scyphistoma. Research  Many efforts to understand the potent toxicity of the Cyanea sting have spanned the realm of biochemical technique. Researchers have elucidated that tentacle extract, essentially essence of tentacle exhibits hemolytic and cardiovascular toxicity simultaneously. Research also shows that pouring saltwater into stings significantly increases flow of venom into body.

In common parlance among prostitutes as well as with others, the act of negotiating and then engaging with a client is referred to as turning a trick.Drexler, Jessica N. \\"Govermennts' role in turning tricks: The world's oldest profession in the Netherlands and the United States.\\" Dick. J. Int'l L. 15 (1996): 201. Female clients are sometimes called janes, although the vast majority of prostitution clients are male in almost all countries. Lexicology There are many terms for clients, including whoremonger, sex-buyer, UK slang such as punter, terms for those in a vehicle such as kerb crawler, as well as Caribbean slang terms for female clients of gigolos such as milk bottle, longtail, yellowtail or stella. The term trick is sometimes associated with North America and punter is associated with the term for sex workers' clients in the British Isles. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes. The term john may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as \\"John\\", a common name in English-speaking countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around red-light districts for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as kerb crawlers.  Motivation  While studies reveal that clients seek out sex with prostitutes to satisfy otherwise unfulfilled sexual desires or simply as a means to establish social bonds with women, evidence suggests that some see purchase of sexual intercourse as purely a consumer product and a means to \\"reestablish the traditional male dominance over women,\\" turning prostitution into a form of anti-feminism. An analysis from 2005 divides the motivation of clients into five broad categories: #the fantasy of “dirty whore”, fuelled by feelings of curiosity and disgust; #Another type of sex, where the desire to experience sexuality that is not possible with a steady partner underwrites the act; # No other women, believes that due to shyness, fear, age or physical or mental disabilities there are no \\"no other women for me\\"; (see inceldom) #Consumer of sex, wherein sex is a product; #Another type of woman, where sex is sought out as an expressions of strong anti-feminist notions, as a reaction to a perceived a loss of masculine supremacy. Demography According to Sabine Grenz of the University of Gothenburg, clients come from all socio-economic classes, and include \\"stockbrokers, truck drivers, teachers, priests or law- enforcement officials.\\" As such, \\"There are no social characteristics that basically distinguish johns from other men.\\" According to Megan Lundstrom of Free Our Girls, 80% to 90% of clients are married men. According to a study by Health and Social Life, 55% of clients are married or cohabiting. Only 39% of clients are aware that one could contract an STI from being fellated.Gurd, Amy, and Erin O’Brien. \\"Californian ‘John Schools’ and the social construction of prostitution.\\" Sexuality Research and Social Policy 10.2 (2013): 149-158. According to Melissa Farley, executive director of Prostitution Research & Education, 60% of clients wear condoms. A survey in Georgia found that 83% of clients would be deterred from purchasing sex if they were outed (named and shamed) on billboards which included photos and names. According to a study by Shared Hope International and Arizona State University, 21.6% of clients had professions commonly perceived as one of a position of authority or position of trust such as law enforcement, attorney or military personnel. In Canada, the average age of a client is between 38 and 42 years old who has purchased sex roughly 100 times over their lifetime. Roughly 70% have completed university or college and earn over 50,000 Canadian dollars a year. The clients of prostitutes in most countries are overwhelmingly male. The most common age cohort of clients in developing countries are vicenarians (those in their twenties).Bishop, Stacey Jacqueline. “Livability is the victim of street prostitution”: the politics of the neighbourhood and the rightward turn in Vancouver’s west end, 1981-1985. Diss. Arts & Social Sciences: Department of History, 2013. Finances The affordability of prostitution greatly varies from region to region. The prices are lowest in areas where it is legal due to competition within the sex trade that seeks to court both sex tourists and local clients.Lee, Julak. \\"Determinants of Johns’ Decision Making: An analysis of a Sex Tourism Web Forum.\\" Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal 5.6 (2018). Time magazine has described Germany as the \\"Cut-Rate Prostitution Capital of the World\\", in reference to the lower charges. When the clientele of prostitutes in a specific locality begins to attract modest amounts of newcomers of a middle-class or upper-class status, the subsequent cost hike is known to reduce the use of such services by less affluent local prospective clients.Roberts, Ron, et al. \\"Participation in sex work: students' views.\\" Sex Education 10.2 (2010): 145-156. In jurisdictions where penalties for buying sex are high, fines imposed on clients can also put low-income clients of prostitution in financial ruin.Monasky, Heather. \\"On Comprehensive Prostitution Reform: Criminalizing the Trafficker and the Trick, but Not the Victim-Sweden's Sexkopslagen in America.\\" Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 37 (2010): 1989. Maltreatment and victimization When interaction between the clients of prostitutes and sex workers occurs in countries where brothels are illegal, the prostitution trade usually transpires in areas with high amounts of crime, a predicament that puts clients at risk of becoming victims of crime, or becoming entangled in the crime in some other manner.Jones, Peter, and Karen Groenenboom. \\"Crime in London hotels.\\" Tourism and Hospitality Research 4.1 (2002): 21-35. According to Atchison, a sociology instructor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, and founder of John's Voice, clients are verbally abused, robbed and physically assaulted at a rate of 18%, 14% and 4% respectively.http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/opinion/story.html?id=c8635c5c-fe88-4b93-993d-9fdd775d002b In Ireland, there was a significant increase in physical attacks on sex workers by clients after the passing of laws banning the purchase of sex. Clients also sometimes fall victim to extortion, scamming and blackmail. Perceptions The manner in which clients were viewed has varied throughout human history depending on location and era. in some periods of history, clients were viewed as enablers of an evil practice, viewing them as furthering a trade which enabled infidelity and easing the breaking of covenants between committed partners. At other times, particularly during times of war, or other events which segregated the sexes, there would be increased sympathy for clients, particularly if service persons threatened to severe their genitals or castrate themselves to attain anaphrodisia if prospective clients were chastised.Chimakonam, Jonathan Okeke, and Sunny Nzie Agu. \\"The Epistemology of Womanhood: Ignored Contentions among Igbo Women of Eastern Nigeria.\\" Thought and Practice 5.2 (2013): 57-79. In contemporary times, clients are sometimes viewed as enablers of human trafficking and child trafficking due to boosting their demand. Females clients have been purported to be viewed less negatively than male clients, possibly due to a perception of novelty that produces curiosity rather than moral judgement.Bernstein, Elizabeth. \\"What's Wrong with Prostitution--What's Right with Sex Work-- Comparing Markets in Female Sexual Labor.\\" Hastings Women's LJ 10 (1999): 91. Legal treatment The manner in which clients are treated by the law varies by jurisdiction and country. The laws which are most stringent against clients have gradually been referred to as the Swedish model, which is also called the Nordic model or Sex Buyer Law. This is in reference to the law passed in Sweden in 1999 wherein the buyer, rather than the seller of sex is penalized. Although Sweden was the first country to criminalize clients rather than prostitutes, many countries have since adopted this Swedish system, with Norway following suit in 2008 and Iceland adopting this model in 2009. Some analysts have argued that this law criminalizing clients rather than prostitutes is peculiar in Western as well as other legal systems, claiming that throughout Western history, there is no precedence of a purchaser of a controversial service committing a greater infraction than the purveyor.Chu, Sandra Ka Hon, and Rebecca Glass. \\"Sex work law reform in Canada: Considering problems with the Nordic model.\\" Alta. L. Rev. 51 (2013): 101. A law passed in Israel at New Year's Eve 2018 which would ban the buying of sex would come into effect in a year and a half. The law, which was proposed by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked in June 2018, would include fines. In 2018, France increased the penalty against buying of sex to a fine of up to 1,500 euros ($1,700). In Italy, a fine of up to 10,000 Euros was proposed in 2016 for frequenters of prostitutes. In Norway, clients can not only be fined, but can also serve up to 6 months in prison. In Germany, clients of sex workers are required by law to wear condoms.Cohen, Bernard. \\"Police Enforcement of Street Prostitution as a Quality-of-Life Offense: New York City, United States, and Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\\" Deviant Behavior (2018): 1-18. In St Petersburg, Russia, a law was drafted which would pardon clients from heavy fines or jail sentences if they married the sex worker they interacted with. In Greater Sudbury, Ontario, another form of deterrent used against clients is the seizure, towing and impounding of vehicles used for soliciting sex workers. Campaigning Campaigners against the criminalisation of clients include Irish law graduate Laura Lee. In some nations where prostitution is legal such as the Netherlands, rather than being viewed as accessories to human trafficking, clients are called on to join efforts to eradicate its practise by being asked to look out for signs of abuse. In France, some opposition to the fining of clients has come from sex workers unions such as Strass, who argue that initiatives to fine clients makes sex work more dangerous as it forces the trade to go underground and due to increased secrecy and less transparency. In 2018, Pope Francis described clients of prostitution as criminals. In the U.S. state of Arizona, some police forces have adopted fake online advertisements which are police generated in order to lure prostitution clients.Dodge, Mary, Donna Starr-Gimeno, and Thomas Williams. \\"Puttin’on the Sting: Women Police Officers' Perspectives on Reverse Prostitution Assignments.\\" International Journal of Police Science & Management 7.2 (2005): 71-85.

According to reports, 15 to 25 civilians were killed over a 24-hour period. It is alleged that the killings were either due to local gang wars or the actions of Haitian officials attempting to quell anti-corruption protests. Background In October 2017, U.N. peacekeepers ended their mission in Haiti after 13 years. Since the departure of the U.N., the number of gang-controlled areas in the city has apparently grown. The massacre occurred in the middle of various protests within Haiti: Jovenel Moïse was elected president in November 2016, but protestors saw him as a sign of corruption within the government. Incident Witness reports state that a police truck carrying uniformed men arrived in Port-au-Prince's La Saline slums at around 3pm on 13 November 2018. The men then opened fire upon civilians, while local gang members killed others with gunfire and machetes. According to witnesses, a human-rights group, at least 21 men were killed in the massacre. A local human-rights group, Fondasyon Je Klere, estimated that between 15 and 25 people were killed. Arrests According to police, one person has been arrested in connection with the killings. Identity of perpetrators Fondasyon Je Klere suggested links between armed gangs, corrupt police officers and government officials may point towards the perpetrators of the massacre. Those who witnessed the massacre also alleged that the killers may have been corrupt police officers, leading the National Police chief to suspend two officers accused of involvement in the killings.

Uses Like other species of pandanus, the leaves of bakong are commonly harvested for weaving mats and other handicrafts in the Philippines, Halmahera, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands. Fibers from the roots can also be made into ropes or twine. The white seeds are edible and taste like coconuts. The flesh of the fruits can also be cooked and eaten. They are eaten in Guam, the Philippines, and Rota Island. Bakong are also commonly cultivated as ornamentals.

Zonfrillo owned the now closed Restaurant Orana in Adelaide, Australia, and is the founder of the not-for-profit The Orana Foundation. Zonfrillo is one of the new MasterChef Australia judges alongside Andy Allen and Melissa Leong.  Biography  Zonfrillo was born in Glasgow, Scotland. His mother's family is Scottish from Dalmellington, Ayrshire while his father’s is Italian from Scauri, Italy. He attended Belmont Academy in Ayr, Scotland. Zonfrillo first started working in kitchens as a dishwasher part time at the age of 13, while still at school and being classically French- trained, however quickly swapped roles to a chef filling in for a cook who called in sick. Zonfrillo then left school aged 15 and started an apprenticeship in the kitchens of The Turnberry Hotel, Scotland after which he worked at the Arkle Restaurant in the Chester Grosvenor Hotel in Chester. Zonfrillo then worked for Marco Pierre White and David Cavalier before travelling to Australia for 12 months in to work with Dietmar Sawyere at Restaurant Forty One in Sydney On returning to the UK, Zonfrillo returned to work for Marco Pierre White before taking his first Head Chef position aged 22 at The Tresanton Hotel, Cornwall, England. Zonfrillo returned to Australia in January 2000 as the Head Chef at Restaurant 41 in Sydney. In May 2007 Zonfrillo was made bankrupt after a creditors petition from Martin Krammer was successful in the Federal Magistrates Court Zonfrillo now resides in New South Wales with his third wife Lauren (Fried) Zonfrillo who herself, as well as being a prominent businesswoman, also appears regularly as a panellist on Gruen. In November 2013, Zonfrillo opened Restaurant Orana and Street ADL in Adelaide winning multiple accolades in both, replacing Street ADL with Bistro Blackwood in September 2017. In 2016, Zonfrillo started his not-for-profit foundation, The Orana Foundation, to preserve the sophisticated cooking techniques and ingredients of The First Australians. The Orana Foundation was awarded the Good Food Guide Food For Good Award in October 2017 and went on to receive global recognition for his Foundation work by winning Basque Culinary World Prize in July 2018. In 2017, Restaurant Orana was named Australia's 2018 Restaurant of the Year by Gourmet Traveller Magazine, the same year Zonfrillo was named Australia's 2018 Hottest Chef in The Australian. In 2018, Zonfrillo was also named Australia's 2019 Restaurant of the Year by the Good Food Guide. In December 2018 Zonfrillo opened a restaurant called \\"Nonna Mallozzi\\", he later closed it in July 2019 after posting losses exceeding $140,000 in the time it was open In October 2019, Zonfrillo was announced as one of the new judges for MasterChef Australia in 2020, alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen. An investigative article on 6 July 2020 in The Australian made the claim that payments from the Orana Foundation were paid into companies associated with Zonfrillo and his wife. The article also claimed that Indigenous representatives had withdrawn from the Indigenous governance panel process. An Indigenous foods database funded by the Foundation was subject to a legal dispute between the Foundation and the University of Adelaide. An Indigenous group has called on Zonfrillo to apologise and hand over his database to a body controlled by Indigenous people In July 2020, Zonfrillo was announced as one of the judges for Junior Masterchef Australia in 2020, alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen. Zonfrillo placed both Restaurant Orana and Bistro Blackwood in voluntary administration in October 2020 blaming the impact of COVID-19.

She graduated from Music School No. 8 in Baku, the Composition Class of A. Zeynalli High Music School in 1957, and the Composition Department of Azerbaijan State Conservatoire (current Baku Academy of Music) named after U. Hajibeyov in 1964.  Career  Ibrahimova composed her first song in 1969. Shovkat Alakbarova was the first performer of her song called \\"Yalan ha deyil\\" composed to Mammad Rahim's poem. Ibrahimova was one of the composers who brought tango rhythm into variety art. Her song \\"Qurban verərdim\\" composed to Rafig Zeka's poem was not accepted by the Artistic Council in the Soviet era. She was told that tango's bourgeois harmony did not match the Soviet spirit. But afterward along with \\"Qurban verərdim\\", \\" Sən mənə lazimsan\\" (poem by Aliagha Kurchayli), \\"Bağçadan keçmisən\\" (poem by A.Alibeyli) and other songs that adopted tango rhythm were added the composer's favorite songs’ list. She was not satisfied with only variety art. She also authored the three-part concert for fortepiano and orchestra which she wrote for her diploma, Afət\\", \\"Şeyx Şamil\\" and \\"Yanan laylalar\\" operas, as well the anthem dedicated to oil workers on the occasion of the 130-year anniversary of the Azerbaijani oil industry. She also composed romances, Sonatas and Quartets. The composer's works \\"Ey vətən\\" (sung by Rashid Behbudov) described Azerbaijan all over the world. She wrote music to the hundreds of poems of Azerbaijan poets and tens of poetic examples in Russian. She died at 74 on 11 February 2012 after a long-term illness. Ibrahimova was buried in the Second Alley of Honor in Baku.
