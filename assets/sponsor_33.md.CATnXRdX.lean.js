Collett, \\"Polarized light in fiber optics\\",SPIE Press, p. 540 (2003)  Types and operation  Polarization controllers can be operated without feedback, typically by manual adjustment or by electrical signals from a generator, or with automatic feedback. The latter allows for fast polarization tracking. A polarization controller can have the task of transforming a fixed, known polarization into an arbitrary one. Since polarization states are defined by two degrees of freedom, for example azimuth angle and ellipticity angle of the polarization state, such a polarization controller needs two degrees of freedom. The same holds for the task of transforming an arbitrary polarization into a fixed, known one. More difficult is the transformation of an arbitrary polarization into another arbitrary polarization. Yet this requires just two degrees of freedom. Such a polarization controller can for example be obtained by placing on the optical path three rotatable waveplates in cascade: a first quarterwave plate, which is oriented to transform the incident elliptical polarization into linear polarization, a halfwave plate, which transforms this linear polarization into another linear polarization, and a second quarterwave plate, which transforms the other linear polarization into the desired elliptical output polarization. While the three rotatable waveplate positions present of course three degrees of freedom, one degree of freedom is consumed in the described case by the choice of linear polarizations before (and hence also behind) the halfwave plate. Polarization controllers can be implemented with free space optics, through a fiber pigtailed U-bench, for example. In that case, light exits the fiber, passes through the three waveplates, that can be freely rotated to allow polarization adjustment and then enters back into the fiber. Polarization controllers can also be implemented in an all- fiber solution. In that case, the polarization of light is changed through the application of a controlled stress to the fiber itself. For polarization controllers with automatic feedback, integrated optical lithium niobate (LiNbO3) devices are very suitableB. Koch, R. No√©, V. Mirvoda, H. Griesser, S. Bayer, H.

Polarization controllers with tracking speeds of up to 100 krad/s on the Poincar√© sphere are commercially available (see external link at the bottom). If not only an arbitrary polarization is to be transformed into a desired one but also the phase shift between this polarization and its orthogonal is to be controlled then three degrees of freedom are necessary. An implementation with a tracking speed of 20 krad/s is described in B. Koch, R. No√©, V. Mirvoda, D. Sandel, First Endless Optical Polarization and Phase Tracker, Proc. OFC/NFOEC 2013, Anaheim, CA, Paper OTh3B.7, Mar. 17-21, 2013 https://www.novoptel.de/Control/Literature/OFC2013_3DOF_presentation_short_n06.pdf https://www.novoptel.eu/Control/Literature/OFC2013_3DOF_presentation_short_n06.pdf. This way the whole normalized Stokes space can be stabilized for implementation of the BB84 or similar quantum cryptography protocol.

Trained as a concert pianist, he was invited to join Sadler's Wells Opera in 1947 in an administrative role, and from 1948 to 1966 he was the managerial head of the company. His translations of operas new to the repertoire and fresh translations of repertoire works were performed by the company at Sadler's Wells Theatre and, after his retirement and the company's move, at the London Coliseum. Early years Tucker was born in the London suburb of Wembley, the son of Walter Edwin Tucker and his wife Agnes Janet.\\"Tucker, Norman Walter Gwynn\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 13 June 2011 He was educated at St Paul‚Äôs School, London, New College, Oxford, and the Royal College of Music.Rosenthal, Harold. \\"Tucker, Norman\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 June 2011 He graduated from the last with a performance of Brahms's Second Piano Concerto conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. Piano career From 1935 until the Second World War he pursued a career as a concert pianist. During the war he served first as a stretcher-bearer in a hospital and then as private secretary to successive Chancellors of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, Sir John Anderson and Hugh Dalton. After the war, Tucker resumed his career as a pianist, but in 1947 the conductor James Robertson invited him to join Sadler‚Äôs Wells Opera as joint director with himself and his co-conductor Michael Mudie. They were dubbed \\"the three Norns\\" by the company.Gilbert, p. 113 Administrative career The two conductors soon handed over all administrative responsibility to Tucker, who ran the company from 1948 until 1966.Gilbert, pp. 116 and 198 His experience at HM Treasury was valuable in the company's frequent negotiations with the Arts Council which dispensed the scarce public subsidies for the arts, and Tucker did much to secure the funding necessary for the survival of Sadler's Wells in the 1950s and 1960s.Gilbert, p. 117 For the company Tucker provided new translations to replace some of the stilted old ones, and translated other libretti into English for the first time. Prominent among the latter was Piave's libretto for Verdi's Simon Boccanegra of which Sadler's Wells gave the British premiere in 1948.Gilbert, p. 118 Other Verdi operas he translated were Luisa Miller and Don Carlos. Tucker was enthusiastic about the operas of Jan√°ƒçek (as was one of the company's rising young conductors, Charles Mackerras) and he translated Katya Kabanova, The Cunning Little Vixen and The Makropulos Affair for their Sadler‚Äôs Wells premieres. Tucker laid great emphasis on the dramatic side of opera, and was proud of attracting leading theatre directors to work at Sadler's Wells; they included Michel Saint-Denis, Glen Byam Shaw and George Devine. He introduced operetta to the company's repertoire. It proved a financial blessing. The success of The Merry Widow saved the company from financial crisis in 1958. That box-office hit, followed by another with Orpheus in the Underworld (1960), made him determined to stage Gilbert and Sullivan as soon the operas came out of copyright and the D'Oyly Carte Company's monopoly ceased at the end of 1961.Gilbert, p. 162 Iolanthe and The Mikado (both 1962) were box-office successes, and popular with the company, though less so with the higher-minded members of the Sadler's Wells board.Gilbert p. 176 Forced retirement Other tensions between Tucker and the board, combined with his great disappointment when a plan for a new opera house on the South Bank of the Thames was abandoned, badly affected his health. He began to drink excessively, and his contract was terminated by the board on 8 March 1966. He was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Arlen. Death After his enforced retirement, Tucker continued to have ties with the company, making further translations including another Jan√°ƒçek opera, The Excursions of Mr. Brouƒçek (1978).\\"Obituary ‚Äì Mr Norman Tucker\\", The Times, 14 August 1978, p. 14 By the time the piece was staged, Tucker had died, aged 68; the first night was dedicated to his memory.Gilbert, p. 310 Notes References * Category:1910 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Opera managers ","title":"Norman Tucker"},{"id":"32068480","title":"Owl Eyes"},{"id":"32068489","text":"Spring Cleaning is a 1925 comedy play by the British writer Frederick Lonsdale.

Upon graduating in 2004, Ellis attended Alfred University to begin working on a Bachelor of Fine Arts. During his studies at Alfred University, his professor told him, \\"Joey, you're going to China.\\", and Ellis found himself in Beijing two weeks later. He became the first American to graduate from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2009. He is currently working towards a Master of Science in Conservation Studies with the University College London in Doha, Qatar where he currently resides. TEDGlobal Fellowship In 2010, Joey Ellis was the recipient of the 2010 TEDGlobal Fellowship program. This program helps world-changing innovators become part of the TEDGlobal community to portray their personal activities and projects. Fellows are chosen from a variety of disciplines.  Notable work  = Social and environmental = Ellis was commissioned by Greenpeace twice. His first project, \\"Hourglass\\", was presented to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during her visit to Beijing as a symbolic message pertaining to the limitations of time regarding the global climate crisis. \\"Hourglass\\" is a 2-foot glass sculpture that took Ellis about four days to create. His second commissioned project, \\"100 Ice Children\\", was an ice installation publicly displayed in Ditan Park, Beijing. The installation consisted of 100 life-sized ice sculptures of children left to melt in the hot Beijing sun to symbolize the effects of global climate change. The ice used was taken from three rivers, the Yangtze, the Yellow and the Ganges, all of which are subject to pollution. = Kungfu4coral = Ellis is head of a multimedia coral and ocean awareness campaign in China that has been ongoing since 2010. The focus behind Kungfu4coral is to fight the \\"global climate monster\\" and serve as the voice for coral in efforts to help protect and preserve coral globally. The campaign focuses on how the Asian population can help create hope and influence coral preservation efforts in a positive way using three methods. The first suggests donating education, technology and design services to non-profits in Asia that are ocean related to help those non-profits grow, develop and partner with other like minded non-profits. The second method helps invent new outlets for environmental arts education in Asia through translation services, the creation of comics and games incorporating kungfu artists to attack the global warming monster, construction of man-made coral reefs and provide a platform for Asian-based environmental artists. The final method puts China first in this global issue by not focusing on the fear that China will destroy the environment, but the hope that they can become an influential leader in environment protection.

It was established December 28, 1991. Since 2004, the National Park has the status of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  History  Kenozero was always a remote area. In the 19th century, the area was divided between Pudozhsky Uyezd (west) and Kargopolsky Uyezd (east) of the Olonets Governorate. In Soviet Union, after a number of administrative changes, the area ended up in the Arkhangelsk Oblast. In 1950s‚Äî1980s, as everywhere in Russian North, the area suffered severely from depopulation, in particular, all villages between Lake Lyokshmozero and Lake Kenozero were deserted. In 1991, the decision was taken to create a National Park in the area. All historical monuments were transferred to the park administration, and some of them have been restored. December 28, 1991 the park was officially created. The staff of the park at the time of creation was 7 persons. In 1992 it was increased to 35 persons, and in 1993 to 153. In 2004, the park became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  Location and geography  Kenozersky National Park occupies the south-western part of Plesetsky District and the north- western part of Kargopolsky District of the Arkhangelsk Oblast, at the border with the Republic of Karelia. The northern part of the Park is centered at the Lake Kenozero, one of the biggest lakes of the region. The headquarters of the Park are located in the village of Vershinino, on the northern shore of the lake. The Lake Kenozero is the source of the Kena River, a major left tributary of the Onega. The upper course of the Kena is located in the park, as well as the Pocha River, the major tributary of the Lake Kenozero, its source, Lake Pochozero, and the lower course of the main tributary of the Lake Pochozero, the Undosha River. The southern part contains Lake Lyokshmozero and the upper course of the Lyokshma River, a tributary of Lake Lacha. Lakes Lyokshmozero and Kenozero are separated by a number of lesser lakes, including Lake Naglimozero and Lake Vilno. Some areas along the Karelian border drain into the basin of the Vodla, and eventually to the Baltic Sea. Thus, the park contains the portion of the divide between the basins of Atlantic and Arctic oceans.  Tourism  The park contains natural as well as cultural monuments, and is also oriented at ecotourism. A number of trails have been opened in the park. There are several wooden architecture monuments. One of them is Porzhensky Pogost in the western part of the park, which is the ensemble of St. George church with the bell-tower (both from the 18th century) surrounded by the wooden wall with gates and towers (1789). The villages adjacent to Porzhensky Pogost have been deserted, and there is no road heading to it, so that the Pogost is only accessible via a pedestrian trail. There are two roads into the park. In the southern part, south of Lake Lyokshmozero, there is an unpaved road connecting Kargopol and Pudozh. Another road in the northern part of the park branches off from the Onezhsky Trakt, connecting Kargopol via Plesetsk to Yemetsk. This road runs to the village on Pershlakhta on Lake Kenozero and then connects to the other villages on and around Lake Kenozero.

Early life  Mary Newcomb was born on August 21, 1893, in North Adams, Massachusetts, the daughter of Josiah Turner Newcomb, and Sophie De Wolfe Newcomb. She grew up in New York City and La Grangeville in Dutchess County, New York. She attended Lauralton Hall Academy, a convent school for girls in Milford Connecticut. Newcomb was an advocate for allowing women to vote, giving speeches with Carrie Chapman Catt and Elsie Lincoln Benedict. She began lecturing on a suffrage tour when she was 17, addressing New York crowds from Albany to Battery Park.  Acting career  Newcomb was discovered and encouraged as an actress by the distinguished actor Robert Edeson, who heard her speaking as a suffragette in New York and recognized her inherent talent. Her \\"first actual role\\" was in His Brother's Keeper, a production of Edeson's company. Newcomb and Edeson were married on June 25, 1918. Mary appeared in ‚ÄúSick-A-Bed‚Äù at the Gaiety Theatre in New York in 1918. She was widely acclaimed for her performance in ‚ÄúWoman on the Jury‚Äù at the Raymond Theatre in 1923. Other performances in her early years included ‚ÄúEasy Street‚Äù in New York, ‚ÄúThe Lady of the Streets‚Äù in Chicago in 1924, and Nighthawk in New York in 1925. They were divorced in 1924. Newcomb married banker Alexander Henry Higginson on June 28, 1925. Alex was from Boston, the son of Henry Lee Higginson, a financier, and Ida Agassiz, the daughter of Louis Agassiz, a noted Harvard professor. Alex was known as an accomplished yachtsman, steeplechaser, and fox hunter. After her marriage Mary retired from the stage briefly and lived with Alex in South Lincoln, Mass. and the Back Bay of Boston. With encouragement from Alex, Mary resumed her acting career in New York in 1927. Together Alex and Mary rented an apartment at 135 East 56th St. She appeared in ‚ÄúA Woman Disputed‚Äù and then again in ‚ÄúThe Distant Drum‚Äù by Vincent Lawrence at the Hudson Theatre. At that time J. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times wrote of her, ‚ÄúMary Newcomb returning from what seems to have been a retirement of some minor sort makes an unusually sympathetic and appealing character of the wife, a part which is with truth from beginning to end.‚Äù She also appeared in ‚ÄúSign on the Door in by Robert R. Mill in March of 1928. In May of 1928 the Higginson‚Äôs apartment was robbed. Thieves got away with jewelry, clothes, and furs. In December of 1928 Mary and Alex went to London where Mary appeared at the Fortune Theater opposite Crane Wilber in ‚ÄúJealousy‚Äù, a two character play adapted by Eugene Walter from a French play by Louis Verneuil. It was a great success and Mary was acclaimed by the critics. In April 1929 she appeared opposite Leslie Banks in ‚ÄúThe Infinite Shoeblack‚Äù by Norman McGowan at the Arts Theatre Club, and in September she appeared as Lady Hamilton in ‚ÄùEmma Hamilton‚Äù, a play by E. Temple Thurston at the New Theatre. The critics were less approving of her next play ‚ÄúHealthy, Wealthy, and Wise‚Äù, a comedy by Eleanor Chilton and Herbert Agar, at the New Theatre about spoiled wealthy New York socialites. Around that time Alex and Mary decided to stay in England permanently. They signed a 40-year lease on Stinsford House (the Dower House of the Duchess of Ilford) in Stinsford near Dorchester, Dorset. There Alex became heavily involved in Fox Hunting and served for many years as Master of the Cattistock Hunt. Eventually he also became Master of the South Dorset Hunt. They kept a flat in Mayfair in London so that Mary could continue her career on the London Stage. Among Mary and Alex's good friends and riding partners were Lord and Lady Digby who lived at nearby Minton Magna. Their daughter Pamela, who was then a teenager, later married Winston Churchill's son Randolph. She eventually went on to marry the American producer, Leland Hayward, and finally, Averill Harriman. In his biography of Pamela, Christopher Ogden said that Pamela's favorite visitors were Alex and Mary Higginson, who were the first Americans she ever met. He wrote that Mary was the most glamorous and fashionable woman Pamela had ever encountered. ‚ÄúShe could sit for hours, her mouth agape, listening to Mary‚Äôs stories and her devastating mimicry.‚Äù In 1930 Mary appeared again in ‚ÄúJealously‚Äù opposite the young actor John Wyse for five nights from June 25 to June 29 at the Arts Theatre Club on Newport Street to favorable reviews. The play then moved to the Little Theatre for several weeks. In August she appeared in ‚ÄúJohn O‚Äô Dreams‚Äù, a comedy in three acts, opposite Jos√© G. Levy, again at the Little Theatre. Mary's next appearance came in December opposite Brian Aherne in ‚ÄúA Marriage Has Been Disarranged‚Äù at the Royalty Theatre. In 1931 Mary starred in another comedy ‚ÄúSupply and Demand‚Äù, by Philip and Amiee Stuart at The Theatre Royal, Haymarket. The cast included Clive Morton, Nigel Bruce, and Marjorie Clark. Later that year Mary appeared in ‚ÄúBehold the Bridegroom‚Äù by George Kelly. Mary then changed course. She starred in her first British film entitled ‚ÄúFrail Women‚Äù under Maurice Elvery's direction at Twickingham Studios. Upon viewing a day's filming Philip Slessor, Film Weekly's Studio Correspondent, described her as mature and dignified, a soign√© and sophisticate, who could take a story of average intelligence and dramatic power and bring to bear upon it a consummate knowledge of stage craft. He said of her, ‚ÄúWith a millionaire husband she has no need to act for a living; she acts because she must. Her personality, and the public, demand that she should.‚Äù After ‚ÄúFrail Women‚Äù, Julius Hagan signed Mary to a three-year film contract, saying ‚ÄúIn my opinion, there is no one of her type to touch her in either England or Hollywood. She has either studied film technique or is a born screen actress.‚Äù Mary went on to star opposite George Barrard in the film ‚ÄúWomen Who Play‚Äù which was based on the successful stage production in of ‚ÄúSpring Cleaning‚Äù. That film was followed by the ‚ÄúThe Marriage Bond‚Äù which included Guy Newall. Many scenes from ‚ÄúThe Marriage Bond‚Äù were filmed in and around Mary and Alex's home at Stinsford in Dorset. In 1932 Mary's career took another important turn when she appeared in her first play by William Shakespeare. She played Portia in ‚ÄúThe Merchant of Venice‚Äù at the St. James Theatre opposite Ernest Milton who played Shylock. Reviewers described their performances as a triumph. In June 1933 Mary appeared in a new play ‚ÄúWhen Ladies Meet‚Äù by Rachel Carothers at the Lyric Theatre. The plot revolves around a love triangle, and the cast included Mary, Marie Tempest, Owen Nares, and Ann Todd. Later that year Mary did something very unusual. Because her entrance in ‚ÄúWhen Ladies Meet‚Äù did not come until the second act, she was able to take on a one act play at another theatre. ‚ÄúLa Voix Humaine‚Äù by Jean Cocteau was a twenty five minute telephone monologue preceding another play at the Ambassadors Theatre. In it Mary presented an abandoned lover's anguish with great emotion. It was described by one reviewer as a tour de force. In December 1933 Mary opened as the lead in an adaptation by R.G. Trevelyan of ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù, a play written by the Hungarian dramatist Melchior Lengyel. In it she played a highly successful married woman who asserts her right to find romantic satisfaction outside her marriage, as many men do. In April 1934 Mary appeared in ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Always Tomorrow‚Äù a new play by Lionel Brown at the Shaftesbury Theatre. In September of that year Mary began the first of five plays in the 1934-1935 Season at the Old Vic. On opening night she played Cleopatra in Shakespeare's ‚ÄúAntony and Cleopatra‚Äù while Wilfred Lawson played Antony. In his review W.A. Darlingtion wrote, ‚ÄúHer performance took her straight into the hearts of the ‚Äúbardolaters‚Äù of Waterloo Road. She is now one of their idols forever.‚Äù Next in November Mary took the role of Beatrice in ‚ÄúMuch Ado About Nothing‚Äù opposite Cecil Trouncer who played Leonato while Nancy Hornsby played Leonato's daughter Hero. In late November and into December Mary continued at the Old Vic in George Bernard Shaw's ‚ÄúSt. Joan‚Äù. Mr. Shaw himself directed the production. And while previously Joan had been portrayed by others as resolute and severe, Shaw encouraged Mary to portray Joan as a sentimental, sweet young woman. This she did and was met with great approval by the audience. As one reviewer summed it up, ‚ÄúIt was in that magnificent lonely speech in Rheims Cathedral that Miss Newcomb found her triumph, though in the Inquisition she lost nothing.‚Äù In January Mary played Emilia in Shakespeare's Othello and in February she was Phaedra in Hippolytus. In March she was Barbara in Bernard Shaw's ‚ÄúMajor Barbara‚Äù opposite Maurice Evans as Adolphus Cusins while Cecil Trouncer played Andrew Undershaft. 1936 began with Mary playing Judith Coventry in ‚ÄúThe Prickly Pear‚Äù at the Q Theatre. In April Mary replaced Irene Brown as Stella Harringway in ‚ÄúChildren to Bless You‚Äù at the Duke of York's Theatre with Marjorie Mars as Audrey. The critic Sydney Carroll extolled Mary's ability to take over the noted actress‚Äô part. ‚ÄúIt was no slavish imitation; a different woman came on the scene without in the slightest destroying the structure of the comedy or even affecting its texture, except, perhaps for the better.‚Äù In November she appeared in ‚ÄúStorm Over Europe‚Äù by Douglas Jerrold, a play about the restoration of a monarch in an unnamed European country. She played Princess Dolores opposite George Hayes who played President Ruysdael.  Post-Theater Life  In 1937 Mary's focus shifted away from the theater so that she could devote time to her husband and her extended family. Her young niece, Mary Gilman, spent a year with Mary and Alex at Stinsford, returning home to America just before the outbreak of World War II. In September 1939 Mary launched The Mary Newcomb Players, a theater troop that traveled through the South of England and later in Europe to support the war effort by producing plays to entertain the troops. Her troupe included actors from London and other places, and whenever possible Mary recruited soldiers who were stationed at various bases to take parts in her productions. In her later years Mary described driving at night during the blackout without headlights down country roads in Southern England to put on performances at obscure bases. In an account of the Players‚Äô first performance of ‚ÄúIn the Zone‚Äù by Eugene O‚ÄôNeill, featuring several young soldiers and presented before 500 of their fellow soldiers, Mary wrote, ‚ÄúIn my Prompt Corner I trembled and paled and doubted that one line would ever be spoken, much less heard. But I was wrong. Utterly sincere and unselfconscious, the boys had their audience quiet and listening in two minutes, and held them so ‚Äì with the help of Mr. O‚ÄôNeill ‚Äì for forty.‚Äù Among the Players‚Äô other productions were ‚ÄúThe Man With A Load Of Mischief‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrench Leave‚Äù, ‚ÄúGas Light‚Äù, and ‚ÄúJealousy‚Äù. In 1943 Mary took her Players to London to raise money to support the troupe's efforts by performing several benefit plays including ‚ÄúA Man With A Load Of Mischief‚Äù and Eugene O‚ÄôNeill's ‚ÄúDays Without End.‚Äù After the D- Day landings in Normandy The Mary Newcomb Players traveled to France, Holland, and Belgium to continue their support for the war effort. After World War II, Mary Newcomb's focus remained with her husband Alex in Dorset. She was active in local affairs and was a patron of the county's annual Music Series. Each year she hosted the Stinsford Church's annual FETE on the grounds of Stinsford House. After the war Mary, who had been confirmed in the Church of England in 1937, joined the Roman Catholic Church. This decision was no doubt influenced by her secondary school education under the Sisters of Mercy at Lauralton Hall, and also by her portrayal of St. Joan. Her husband Alex died in 1957. Several years later Mary moved out of Stinsford House to a house in the nearby Village of Puddletown. She spent several months each winter in New York where her sister, brother, and extended family lived. Death Newcomb died on December 26, 1966, at her home in England at age 73. She is buried with her husband Alex in the churchyard of St. Michael's Church adjacent to Stinsford House.

He is credited with recording the existence of fourteen plant species previously unknown to science including Dryopteris goldieana, Stellaria longipes and Drosera linearis.  Personal life  Goldie was born in Kirkoswald in 1793, the son of William Goudie and Janet McClure. When Goldie was a teenager he apprenticed as a gardener and was employed at the Glasgow Botanic Garden where he accumulated most of his knowledge of botany. He also studied language at the University of Glasgow and could speak fluent Greek, French and Hebrew, although he never registered for a degree due to financial problems.P. M. Eckel. John Goldie in North America, Parts 1 and 2. Clintonia Vol. 4, Issue 5, Pages 1-5. September 6, 1989. While in Glasgow Goldie made the acquaintance of James Smith, a well known local botanist and florist, and began spending time at his home near Maybole in Ayrshire. Smith would teach Goldie about horticulture and help him expand his knowledge of botany. In 1815, Goldie married Smith's daughter Margaret and would go on to have nine children with her.  Botanical career  Shortly after his marriage in 1815 the English Government decided to send an expedition to the coast of Africa to explore the Congo River. After passing an examination Goldie was selected to accompany the expedition as a botanist but at the last moment was superseded by someone else. Many of the officers and crew of the expedition contracted and died of coast fever and the expedition was later abandoned. In 1817, at the instance of his colleague Sir William Jackson Hooker, Goldie was able to raise enough money to voyage to North America to collect botanical samples. He departed from Leith and landed in Halifax after being diverted from his original destination of New York due to bad weather. From Halifax he traveled to Quebec and collected botanical samples for two weeks before departing to Montreal, Quebec. While in Montreal Goldie met with Frederick Traugott Pursh, a fellow botanist and author of Flora americae septentrionalis; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America. After leaving Montreal Goldie crossed the Saint Lawrence River and walked down the Hudson River to his original destination of New York. It is possible that the pine barrens of eastern New Jersey were known to Goldie as a rich source of plant life because he went directly to the area and began collecting. His notes record that he assembled a considerable amount of material \\"as large a load as my back would carry\\".Spawn, William. 1961. In Goldie, 1819. Diary of a Journey Through Upper Canada and Some of the New England States. Privately Published, Toronto. With very little money Goldie took a job as a teacher and stayed in New York over the winter in 1818. He returned to Montreal looking to accompany traders heading to the north west but was unable to find any. He decided to take another job as a laborer and would spend weekends plant hunting, on one occasion he explored a short distance up the Ottawa river. In the fall of 1818 Goldie packed up his latest collection of plants and sent them out to sea. Unfortunately, his first three shipments of collected materials were lost at sea en route to Scotland. During the next winter, in 1819, Goldie had earned some money making flower designs in Montreal. After accumulating enough money he decided to set out on one last expedition before returning to Scotland. This journey, which started in early June and ended in late August, is documented in his surviving diary and provides a rare glimpse of life in the sparsely settled land around the Great Lakes. In late 1819, Goldie returned safely home with specimens intact. He continued to work with the Glasgow Botanical garden where he met the young David Douglas, who apprenticed under Goldie for five years. In 1822, with the help of William Hooker, he published Description of some new and rare plants discovered in Canada in 1819 in the Journal of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. One of the plants which Goldie had brought back was named Aspidium goldianum, later Dryopteris goldieana, by Hooker in honor of Goldie. Seeds of the newly discovered fern were also propagated in the Glasgow Botanical Garden. Dryopteris goldieana Goldie traveled to St. Petersburgh, Russia in 1824, where he was employed by Alexander I, and later Nicholas I, to help establish a new botanical garden. He also established his own nursery business during the same period with the object of providing additional income for his family. The standard author abbreviation Goldie is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name.  Later years and death  After many visits to Canada Goldie decided to move his family to Ayr, Ontario in 1844, where he rented and later purchased a farm. The family would go on to construct and operate a number of successful mills throughout the Waterloo Region. In 1861 Goldie retired and his son David took over management of the mills. Goldie's other son, John, co-founded the Goldie & McCulloch Co. which manufactured steam engines in Galt, Ontario. In 1876 David decided to build a house that could accommodate his growing family.Goldie, Theresa. The Goldie Saga, Parts 1, 2 and 3. 1968, 1972, 1982 When construction of the house was completed Goldie moved in with his son and planted two specimens of the Douglas fir on the property in memory of his friend and colleague David Douglas. He later died there at the age of 93. Goldie's grandson Thomas served as mayor of Guelph from 1891 to 1892 and his other grandson, Lincoln, served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1923 to 1931.  John Goldie Award  In 2007 the John Goldie Award for Field Botany was established by the Field Botanists of Ontario organization. The award recognizes individuals who have made a significant contribution to the advancement of field botany in Ontario.

The webtoon began in February 2008 and received an award at the Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival that same year. A paperback version was released on October 23, 2008. Welcome to Convenience Store was adapted into multiple animated series, as well as a mobile game distributed by Kakao. Characters from the webtoon have appeared in a variety of media and merchandise. Development Photographer Ji Kang-min started drawing Welcome to Convenience Store in 2008, thinking it would be nice to release a story based on one of the most well-known settings. Kang-min gets a large amount of fanmail containing stories and concerns from retail employees, some of which he introduces to the webtoon. Kang-min stated in 2010 that the webtoon doesn't make him much money, which was his reason to expand to different types of media, such as animation. In an interview with The Korea Times, Kang-min stated that when he started drawing cartoons, he overworked himself as there was a large amount of labor to do. During this period, he spent two days per week writing up scripts, and the other five days to draw the cartoon itself. As of 2015, he only needs two days to draw the comic itself, as he no longer has to use up his time with routine processes. For example, he no longer needs to draw backgrounds, as he adapted 3D-rendered backgrounds. Kang-min stated that his life motto is to \\"not to skip a meal and not to pass a night without sleep,\\" and that he is currently \\"fully benefiting from my digitalized environment.\\" In 2015, Kang-min started a new webtoon series titled The Commute Family, which focuses on the everyday events in public transportation. The new series is published on KakaoPage rather than Naver. Summary Welcome to Convenience Store chronicles the everyday, yet silly events at a fictional South Korean convenience store. Though the webtoon is purely episodic in nature, it features a recurring set of part-time workers. Kang-min initially intended to focus primarily on the store's employees, but after receiving positive responses from his readers, he shifted the focus of the webtoon more to the customers. Other media Infinite. In 2010, Yoo Se-yoon of the comedy music duo UV revealed \\"Convenience\\", a music video featuring characters from Welcome to Convenience Store. Convenience store chain 7-Eleven featured characters from the webtoon on its products, and some of the characters have been realized as toys by Korean toy manufacturer Oxford Blocks. =Animation= A web animation based on Welcome to Convenience Store was produced in October 2009. Published on Naver and later broadcast on Tooniverse, the animated series was intended for promotional purposes rather than direct profit, and it was the first web animation based on a webtoon, or \\"Ostuni\\". An animated television series based on Welcome to Convenience Store was announced in 2010, and eventually produced by cable channel Tooniverse in 2012. The series was produced as part of the 2010 \\"Annie Challenge\\" and was aired as 20 episodes, each 30 minutes long. Members of the South Korean boy band Infinite appeared in the series as guest stars, as well as singing the opening theme \\"Always Open\\". =Mobile game= Welcome to Convenience Store was adapted into a mobile game in 2014, distributed through KakaoTalk. The video game, titled Work It! Convenience Store, quickly became one of the top- selling games on Google Play. The game won the \\"Best Korean Mobile Game Business\\" in 2014. Work It! exceeded 500,000 downloads in the first weeks of its launch, and has been downloaded by over five million people as of March 2016. In Work It!, the player takes on the role of manager of a convenience store, as which he can decorate the building, purchase wares, and perform a variety of chores. Through the course of the game, a player can eventually create their own \\"unique\\" convenience store. Work It! includes various intricate systems such as street vendors and plant food that allow players to micromanage their store. The game also features various mechanics that allows the player to assist or compete against other players. Reactions Welcome to Convenience Store received an award at the Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival in 2008. Characters from the webtoon were exhibited as a pop-up store in the Korean Comics Museum in January 2015. In 2010, Kang-min's webtoon spurred some political controversy when he published a page featuring a girl apprehending a shoplifter based on the way he looked. Kang-min apologized shortly after, and stated that he would give \\"more careful consideration when selecting the material\\" to use in the webtoon in the future.

More basically, it may also be construed as the \\"non-occurrence of one form due to the simple existence of another.\\" Word formation employs processes such as the plural marker in English s or es (e.g. dog and dogs or wish and wishes). This plural marker is not, however, acceptable on the word child (as in *childs), because it is \\"blocked\\" by the presence of the competing form children, which in this case inherits features from an older morphological process. Blocking may also prevent the formation of words with existing synonyms, particularly if the blocked form is morphologically complex and the existing synonym is morphologically simple, e.g. *stealer which is blocked by the existing simple form thief. One possible approach to blocking effects is that of distributed morphology, which asserts that semantic and syntactic features create slots or cells in which items can appear. Blocking happens when one cell is engaged by one form as opposed to another. Blocking has been explained along two primary dimensions: the size of the blocking object, and the existence of ungrammatical forms.

He received elementary education in the local school in Ystradowen before entering employment in a coalmine as a teenager. He later joined the Merchant Navy as an able seaman, subsequently working on the light ships maintained by Trinity House. By 1913 he was resident in Poplar, and was elected to the local board of guardians. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he enlisted in the Welsh Regiment, and spent most of the war in India. After the war he was employed in the docks by the Port of London Authority and was an official in the Transport and General Workers Union. In 1919 he was elected as a Labour Party member of Poplar Borough Council, later becoming an alderman and was mayor of Poplar in 1934 ‚Äì 1935.

It is the largest and most populous village in the municipality.  History and geography  The settlement of Lauterbach is located at about above sea level, east of the centre of Brixen. Its name comes from the mountain stream of Lauterbach that has significantly affected the development of the settlement for centuries. In 1812, the village had around 30 houses with 167 inhabitants. After the Second World War, there was twice that number of houses; in recent years, there have been over 200 houses, with around 900 inhabitants. The reason for the rapid growth in population in recent decades is due, on the one hand, to land prices, and on the other to the farmers who lived there. Because, in the main, only small farmers lived in Lauterbach, only full-time farmers lived in the village centre of Brixen around the church. As a result, these farmers and the church, too, were less prepared to sell land to settlers than the many smallholding farmers in Lauterbach. As a result, a proper village centre never developed. 1946: severe weather came down from the Hohe Salve. Hailstones the size of a fist rained down. The Brixenbach broke its banks and largely flooded the village of Feuring-Winkl. The Lauterbach became a raging torrent. Large rocks filled the stream bed to such an extent that water poured into the centre of the village and tore away anything that stood in its way. All the houses were devastated by mud and debris, and all the cellars were flooded. Telephone lines were disrupted. Rubble and piles of wood blocked the railway. Near the village centre, the Lauterbach finally flowed into the Brixentaler Ache. All lead and tile roofs were badly damaged; there was even a hole in the roof of the rectory. 1951: heavy rain led to flooding. The Lauterbach covered the federal road and the railway track. Rail and road traffic were held up for hours. 1957: the houses in Brixen and Lauterbach were connected to a new water mains that came from the Gaisberg. 1971: serious flooding occurred again in Brixen. The Lauterbach broke its banks again. Work parties laboured into the early hours of the morning in order to prevent further flooding. 1975: flood warnings in the village of Lauterbach. The newly built road bridge over the Lauterbach was entirely ripped away. The floods cause major damage.  References  Sources: * Sebastian Posch (ed.): Brixen im Thale 788-1988. Ein Heimatbuch.

The Blues officially entered the Confederate Army at Ft. Marion on August 5, 1861 and were designated Company B of the recently organized Third Florida Infantry. The Blues sustained heavy casualties in the Battle of Murfreesboro in Tennessee. The following year they marched to Mississippi in an effort to relieve the Siege of Vicksburg and in the fall of 1863, they fought in the battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga. In the spring of 1865 the unit was in the Carolinas trying to slow the advance of General William Tecumseh Sherman after Sherman's 'March to the Sea'. The Saint Augustine Blues service in the Civil War ended on April 26, 1865 one month after their participation in the Battle of Bentonville after General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to General Sherman at Bennett Place, in Durham, North Carolina, the site of the largest surrender of Confederate soldiers which ended the war.Lane, p.298.

Reception Cloud Dancer was released earlier, but had its worldwide premiere in Milwaukee on May 29, 1980. Although the aerial sequences were spectacular, the film was not well received. Aviation historian Stephen Pendo considered it an example of an aviation film that could not be saved by its vivid cinematography.

It lies in the south of the Cotswolds, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In the 2001 United Kingdom census, the parish had a population of 398, increasing to 408 at the 2011 census. History Poulton was listed as Poltone in the Domesday Book of 1086. Historically, the village was part of the county of Wiltshire and for centuries was ‚Äî physically detached from Wiltshire ‚Äî an enclave in Gloucestershire. Under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, Poulton finally became part of Gloucestershire. There was a parish church at Poulton by at least 1337, when the lord of the manor, Sir Thomas Seymour, endowed it with a chantry. In 1348, Seymour built what became the Priory of St Mary. From 1539, with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the priory was used as Poulton's parish church. It was demolished in 1873. The current parish church, dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, was built in 1873 by William Butterfield. Governance Poulton is part of the Hampton ward of the Cotswold district, currently represented by Councillor Lisa Spivey, a member of the Liberal Democrats. Poulton is part of the constituency of The Cotswolds, currently represented at parliament by Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020.

The album was released on the newstarted, now legendary Service label and was the beginning of a new popera in Gothenburg. The album consists of 10 songs recorded by Bj√∂rn Olsson in Sehr Sch√∂√∂n studios and is a blend of disco-pop, twee and pubrock. In combination with the bands anti-rock aesthetics and disrespectful live performances the Embassy became a both loved and questioned band. Futile Crimes won Manifest and N√∂jesguiden prize for best album 2002. Tacking (2005) The group released their second album, Tacking, to positive reviews. David Coleman, of No Ripcord, said that \\"I certainly appreciate how perfect this would sound as the soundtrack to a drunken barbeque or even beach party, but I‚Äôm in dreary old Sheffield and you know what? Tacking still sounds pretty great to me.\\" and awarded the album a score of 8/10. This was supported Laura Snapes, who felt the album closely mirrored the environment from which it originates, stating \\"So much of this album is just pure ecstasy that Rough Guides should consider adopting it as their guide to the city ‚Äì the sunny xylophone ting and winsome violins of \\"It Pays To Belong\\" to walk the cobbled streets of Haga, the old town, the mellow \\"Information\\" to cycle down the coastal path to the southern archipelago amidst an encroaching feel of melancholy as you look back at your friends and realise that summer won‚Äôt last, and \\"Was That All It Was\\" to dance at Pustervik‚Äôs Pingisklubben night, gleefully hitting ping pong balls off the table after a few too many pear ciders before shaking it to the awesomely old school saxophone solo.\\" and awarding the album a 72% score.

It is a little over wide at its widest point and little more than a few hundred metres at its narrowest. The provincial border between Ontario and Quebec runs through the length of the lake with the City of Ottawa on its southern shore and the city of Gatineau on much of its northern shore. It is officially known by the French name only. The shoreline is mostly gently sloped and composed of broken limestone interspersed with smaller sections of aquatic shoreline vegetation or mudflats. Above the Chats Falls Dam is Lac des Chats. Below Britannia is a series of rapids and waterfalls culminating with the Chaudi√®re Falls. Between the rapids and the falls, the river is not navigable. Recreational boating and sailing Britannia Yacht Club, established 1887 in Ottawa, Ontario Lac Desch√™nes is used for recreational boating and sailing. It is home to five sailing clubs and one commercial marina. Britannia Yacht Club is the oldest, established in 1887. It is located at the eastern end of the lake near the Desch√™nes Rapids. Next is the Nepean Sailing Club established in 1979 but now the largest of the Ottawa area sailing clubs. It is located in Dick Bell Park on Carling Avenue in the former City of Nepean. The Lac Desch√™nes Sailing Club and the Kanata Sailing Club are the two smaller clubs consisting primarily of dinghy fleets. On the Quebec side of the lake is the Club de Voile Grande-Rivi√®re located at the Aylmer Marina. Further upstream on the Ontario side is the Port of Call Marina. Numerous launch ramps exist on both sides of the lake. On the Ontario side, these are located at Fitzroy Harbour, Buckham's Bay, Port of Call Marina, Shirleys Bay, and the Nepean Sailing Club. A small public dock exists at Pinhey's Point while the village of Quyon maintains much larger public dock facilities near the western end of the lake. Access between Ontario and Quebec across Lac Desch√™nes is provided by a ferry service between West Carleton and Quyon. Although a bridge has been proposed, it has not yet received approval. Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart 1550 - Britannia Bay to Chats Falls covers the whole of Lac Desch√™nes. The Canadian Coast Guard maintains lights and buoys on the lake, however local emergency services in Ottawa and Gatineau are responsible for providing search and rescue services within their respective city boundaries. The nearest Coast Guard radio is in Prescott (VHF Ch. 16 or cellular telephone *16) however dialling 911 is the most effective means of reaching local emergency services. Chart datum is 57.9 metres above sea level. Current water levels can be found on the Ottawa River Levels website. Water levels fluctuate on Lac Desch√™nes approximately 0.9 m annually, with the high on average of 58.8 m occurring during the spring freshet and the low on average of 57.9 m occurring during September. Water levels are affected strictly by the flows being passed from upstream. Waters are slow flowing except immediately below the dam at Chats Falls and again at Britannia Rapids. Although much of Lac Desch√™nes is relatively shallow, generally less than 9.0 m, there is a deep trough between Twelve Mile Island and Aylmer Island that reaches depths of 49 m. Fishing Numerous species of sport fish can be found in Lac Desch√™nes including black crappie, pickerel (walleye), muskie, and pike. Catfish abound in many of the bays. Birding Ring-billed, herring and great black-backed gulls are abundant as well as various other waterfowl species. Large numbers of Canada geese and other waterbirds stop at the lake during their fall migration. Mallards have been seen particularly in the Shirleys Bay area. Red-throated loons, Arctic terns, and common terns have also been spotted. Moderate numbers of shorebirds concentrate in the muddier parts of the shoreline such as at Shirleys Bay and Andrew Hayden Park. A colony of purple martins makes their home at the Nepean Sailing Club.

Two villages of the V√´rrini region in Kosovo and one village of the Gora region in Albania are traditionally associated with Luma only in relation to their historical tribal affiliation (yellow) with the historic Albanian tribe (fis) of the same name. It includes the village with the same name, Lum√´, which is located in Albania. Luma is surrounded by Has region (north and northwest), Fan and Orosh (west), Re√ßi and M‚ÄôUj√´ e m‚ÄôUja (south west), Upper Reka (south east), Gora (east), Opoja and V√´rrini of Prizren (north east). The region itself also includes the small Arr√´ni tribe in the west and the Morina tribe in the east. Only a small portion of the region, half of historic T√´rthor√´ bajrak (tribal banner), is situated within the borders of Kosovo, from Prizren city to the border between Kosovo and Albania. Women from the region of Lum√´ dancing in a folk festival, with regional traditional clothing During the Balkan wars (1912-1913), Serb military forces attempting to assert their control of the region entered Luma and attacked local inhabitants, killed tribal chieftains, removed livestock belonging to the population and razed villages. The actions resulted in a local uprising by Albanians. Serb forces retaliated through a scorched earth policy and massacres of the population ranging from the young to elderly, both men and women such as barricading people in mosques and houses and then firing upon or burning them. Following the events, 25,000 people fled to Kosovo and western Macedonia. The events have been considered as constituting a \\"localized genocide\\". History The region is documented first in the 16th century (1571 -1591), as a nahiye of the Sanjak of ƒ∞pek, whereas in the 17th century it is mentioned by Frang Bardhi as the most eastern frontier of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sap√´.Fejzulla Gjabri (Department of Culture of Albania), Information about the Heroic Epos in the Province of Luma It is thought that before the 18th century the timar system was replaced by the self-governing system of bajrak. Luma has had 7 bajraks: #Bajrak of Rrafsha (the bajraktar was centered in Bicaj), #Bajrak of Tejdrina (the bajraktar was centered in Ujmisht and then in Domaj), #Bajrak of Qafa (the bajraktar was centered in Bushtric√´), #Bajrak of Kalisi (the bajraktar was centered in Zall√´-Kalis), #Bajrak of Radomira (the bajraktar was centered in Tejs), #Bajrak of √áaja (the bajraktar was centered in Fshat), #Bajrak of Topojan (the bajraktar was centered in Brekij√´). The last organization of these bajraks was done in 1912 in the battle of Qafa e Kolesjanit, against the Serbian army. =Massacres committed by the Serbian army during 1912= Leo Freundlich, an Austrian correspondent who was in Luma at the time, reported that General Bozidar Jankovic, ordered his army to commit massacres of the Albanians of Luma resulting in entire villages being burned down with the inhabitants being burned or slaughtered alive. All in all, twenty-seven villages on Luma territory were burnt to the ground and their inhabitants slain, even the children. It was here that one of the most appalling atrocities of the Serbian war of annihilation was committed against the Albanians. Women and children were tied to bundles of hay and set on fire before the eyes of their husbands and fathers. The women were then barbarously cut to pieces and the children bayoneted. A colleague of Freundlich wrote \\"It is all so inconceivable, and yet it is true!\\" Four hundred men from Luma who gave themselves up voluntarily were taken to Prizren and executed day after day in groups of forty to sixty.

It is located in the Imeko Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State, Nigeria, very close to the border with Benin. Celestial City is known as \\"Jerusalem\\" by the celestials. The city has potential as a tourist location. Origins Imeko is a small, spread out village in a hilly region of Ogun State a few kilometers from the Benin border. The vegetation is a mixture of savannah belt and sparse forest suitable for cattle raising. Most people are engaged in farming, with tomatoes and cassava being the most important crops. Imeko is the home town of the mother of the Prophet \\"Papa\\" Samuel Oshoffa, who founded the Celestial Church of Christ in 1947 in Dahomey (now Benin), moving to Nigeria in 1979. In 1973 a visionary, Pa Muri Adoye told Oshoffa of a visitation by a troop of angels who had said the Celestial City must be built at Imeko in a place called Igbo-Ifa, home of the traditional Yoruba deity Orunmila. Mecca would be closed and Jerusalem would move to Imeko. This confirmed messages the Prophet believed he had received from Christ. Oshoffa initiated construction of the Celestial City in 1983. Oshoffa had directed that if he died in Nigeria he should be buried near his mother on family land at Imeko, and his burial ground be treated as holy ground and a place of pilgrimage. If he were to die in Dahomey he was to be buried at Seme in his home town of Porto-Novo. Oshoffa died in Lagos, Nigeria on 10 September 1985 a few days after surviving a car crash. He was buried according to his wishes at Celestial City on 19 October 1985 with great ceremony. He left behind 34 wives and 150 children. The Porto-Novo congregation was angry at the choice of burial place, and there were rumors of plans to remove the body to Porto-Novo. The Nigerian police took special precautions to prevent this happening. Ceremonies Alexander Abiodun Adebayo Bada was proclaimed the second Pastor of the church on 17 December 1985, and his appointment was ratified by the general congregation at their annual Christmas festival and convocation at Imeko on 25 December 1985. After a two-year waiting period, Bada was enthroned as Pastor at Celestial City on 24 December 1987. Imeko became a place of pilgrimage at Christmas for thousands of Celestial Christians from Nigeria, from other parts of West Africa and from more distant parts including London and the United States, although most of the Benin congregation gather in Seme, Porto-Novo. The journey to Imeko is expensive and may be difficult to accomplish. Travelers from Abidjan in C√¥te d'Ivoire, for example, face a long coach ride costing the equivalent of a month's minimum wages. The traveler must pay visa fees, informal fees at border crossings, and anointment fees on arrival. But an important part of the pilgrimage is the opportunity to be anointed, which can only be done by the Pastor of the church, and usually only at Imeko. When Pastor Bada died, he was buried at Celestial City on the 29th day of September, 2000. Ogun State Governor Olusegun Osoba represented President Olusegun Obasanjo at the funeral ceremony. There had been a legal challenge to the burial of Bada close to the Oshoffa's tomb, with Rev. Edward Olayinola Oladokun saying that the burial would erode Oshoffa's intentions for Celestial City to become a pilgrimage centre. The 3rd pastor, Philip Hunsu Ajose, was appointed the new leader at a meeting on 24 December 2000 at Celestial City. However, Ajose soon became terminally ill, and died on 2 March 2001. He was buried on 30 March 2001 at the conference center at Celestial City. Ajose's succession was disputed, and by October 2003 the church had split into four factions. One was led by the founder's son Emmanuel Oschoffa, chosen by the board of trustees, one by Paul Suru Maforikan, chosen by the council of superiors of CCC Worldwide, one by Superior Evangelist Agbaosi of Benin and one by Superior Evangelist Josiah Kayode Owudunni. The schism had still not been resolved as of April 2010, with six claimants to be pastor, although the Supreme Court had declared that nobody could call himself Pastor of the CCC until the church had a new constitution. Buildings Plans to build a cathedral at the National Headquarters, Makoko had been initiated and approved by the founder in 1973, but were put on hold when planning began for Celestial City. The original plan, revealed in a celestial vision, was for Celestial City to include a huge cathedral, a prayer garden, conference hall, residence for the pastor, inns for each diocese and so on. Later, plans were made to build an impressive mausoleum for the prophet. Work began, foundations were laid and some pillars erected, but a 2002 report said that the Celestial City was still essentially a building site. A market has sprung up to sell religious goods such as candles and vestments, as well as food and drink. With no formal facilities, the pilgrims must camp where they can find a place. When the pilgrims leave, the site becomes virtually deserted. Senior Prophetess Rosaline Bola Sodeinde, known as the \\"spiritual daughter\\" of the church founder, was reported to be raising funds for building a basilica at Celestial City in 1995. During his short tenure, in 2001 Pastor Ajose ordered that the seminary at Makoko, in the outskirts of Lagos, be transferred to Imeko. This was ratified by the board of trustees. He also ordained that any Pastor who succeeded him should live at Imeko. At Ajose's burial, youths carried placards reading \\"The emerging pastor must stay in Imeko\\", \\"Complete the Celestial city project\\" and \\"Don't change Papa Oschoffa's plan for Imeko\\". One of the youth leaders said the people of the town wanted church elders to develop Celestial city faster, making it more than just a burial ground. However, despite plans for more construction at the site, little was done. In a statement dated 27 January 2009, Evangelist (Prophet) Samuel Olumuyiwa Oshodi said \\"All projects in the Celestial City, Imeko ... have become major embarrassment to right thinking Celestians ‚Äì just because we lack Godly leadership\\".

Retrieved 20 August 2017. The concept of menstrual leave started in Japan in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, Japanese labor unions started to demand leave (seiri kyuka) for their female workers. In 1947, a law was brought into force by the Japanese Labor Standards that allowed menstruating women to take days off work. Then a unique legislation of its kind, it is now found in a few countries. Debate continues as to whether it is a medical necessity or a discriminatory measure. Corporate policies Nike also included menstrual leave in their Code of Conduct in 2007, implemented around the globe wherever they operate. Nike obliges the business partners to follow the code principles by signing a memorandum of understanding. Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) started a campaign for menstrual leave for female employees at Toyota. The union asked for 12 paid days of menstrual leave for a woman per year. Coexist, a Bristol community interest firm, introduced a \\"period policy\\" in order to give women more flexibility and a healthier work environment. Hoping to break down the menstruation taboo, Coexist became the first company in the United Kingdom to implement this policy. Legislative situations Menstrual leave policies exist in some countries, although individual companies in countries that do not have national laws may choose to implement such policies. =Asia= In Indonesia, under the Labor Act No. 13 in 2003, women have a right to two days of menstrual leave per month. In Japan, Article 68 of the Labour Standards Law states \\"When a woman for whom work during menstrual periods would be specially difficult has requested leave, the employer shall not employ such woman on days of the menstrual period.\\" While Japanese law requires that a woman going through especially difficult menstruation be allowed to take leave, it does not require companies to provide paid leave or extra pay for women who choose to work during menstruation. In South Korea, not only are female employees entitled to menstrual leave according to the Article 71 of the Labour Standards Law, but they are also ensured additional pay if they do not take the menstrual leave that they are entitled to. In Taiwan, the Act of Gender Equality in Employment gives women three days of \\"menstrual leave\\" per year, which will not be calculated toward the 30 days of \\"common sick leave\\", giving women up to 33 days of \\"health-related leaves\\" per year. The extra three days do not come with half-pays once a woman employee exceeds the regulated 30. =Europe= In Europe, currently there is no country with a national menstrual leave policy. One of the strategies of the EU Member States, as well as the WHO European policy framework, Health 2020, is to address the health and safety issues that affect women. However, it has been argued that a menstrual leave policy brands all menstruating women as ill and perpetuates sexism; and that such a policy could increase the bias in hiring and promoting women. The proposal by the Italian Parliament to introduce a menstrual leave policy in 2017 sparked debate in Europe on how menstrual health impacts women in the workforce. The bill would introduce a policy for companies to offer three days paid leave for women who suffer severe menstrual cramps. However, the policy has not been enacted, similar to Russia in 2013. = Africa = In Zambia, as of 2015, women are legally entitled to a day off each month due to their menstrual leave policy, known as \\"Mother's Day\\". If a women employee is denied of this policy, she can rightfully prosecute her employer.

The Treaty and came about because Elector John George of Brandenburg had violated the requirements made in Dispositio Achillea in his will. In these provisions, the indivisibility of the Mark of Brandenburg has been prescribed as a mandatory principle of succession. John George, however, had stipulated his will that part of the Neumark and Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie should be separated from the Mark and given to his two younger sons. History Immediately after John George's death in 1598, his eldest son and successor, Elector Joachim Frederick contested the will and consulted with Margrave George Frederick I. He was the last descendant of the elder branch of the Franconian Hohenzollerns and ruled the two margraviates of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Kulmbach. George Frederick had no offspring of his own. This consultation led to the House Treaty of Gera: Joachim Frederick would inherit the whole Mark of Brandenburg (immediately) and his younger brothers would inherit the Franconian principalities (after George Frederick's death). The younger brothers had to renounce their claims that were based on John George's invalid will. After the House Treaty of Gera was finally accepted by all parties concerned, it was ratified on 29 April 1599 in Magdeburg. The most important paragraph of the agreement was that each Elector of Brandenburg should always inherit the entire and undivided Mark, because this was considered an integral part of the Electoral dignity. The indivisibility of the Mark of Brandenburg that was already prescribed in the , was renewed and reaffirmed. John George's younger sons were compensated with the succession of the Franconian possessions of the Hohenzollerns. After George Frederick's death, they would receive both his Margraviates as hereditary secundogenitures. To decide who would inherit which principality, they would have to draw lots among themselves, as had been the practice before the Dispositio Achillea.

The van originated as a front wheel drive light van produced by Chenard-Walcker, whose business Peugeot had acquired by 1950.Claude Rouxel, Jacques Dorizon, Marc Clouet et Fran√ßois Vauvillier, Chenard et Walcker - Far, l'empire disparu de Gennevilliers, √©ditions Histoire et Collections. The van, based on a wartime design, was relaunched, soon after the Liberation, in June 1946 as the Chenard-Walcker CPV. In this form it was powered by a two-cylinder water- cooled two-stroke engine of just 1,021 cc. Power output of 26 hp was claimed. Accepting that even by the standards of the time, this level of power was insufficient, in 1947 the manufacturers switched to using the 1,133 cc engine of the Peugeot 202, and claimed power increased to 30 hp. The original two- cylinder engine had the merit of being very compact, and in order to accommodate the four-cylinder unit from Peugeot the nose of the van had to be extended, which compromised the clean frontal design of the original van and gave rise to frequent use of the ¬´Nez de cochon¬ª (‚Äúpig nose‚Äù) soubriquet. Providing the van‚Äôs engine to Chenard-Walcker at a time when the business was short of cash left Peugeot as a major creditor, and therefore at the front of the line of any potential purchasers of the business as it became apparent that Chenard-Walcker could not survive independently. Peugeot‚Äôs acquisition of the business led to the van‚Äôs rebranding as a Peugeot, although it was January 1951 before the Chenard et Walcker CP3 (as their CPV had by now become) was formally discontinued. Power was also increased late in 1950 when the engine from the (by now no longer produced) Peugeot 202 was replaced by the 1,290 cc engine of the recently introduced Peugeot 203. The D3 was redesignated as the D3A. Already the engine change enabled Peugeot to advertise the van‚Äôs power output as 32 hp, and during the next few years the vehicle benefited from further enhancements as the engine was developed both for the van and for what was at the time the company‚Äôs only passenger car. Power was increased to 40 hp in 1952, marked by the renaming of the van as the D3B. In February 1953, for drivers who did not like to work alone, a passenger seat was fitted. In 1955 Peugeot added a second model to their passenger car range, and the van acquired the 1,468 cc engine of the newly launched Peugeot 403 which even in the detuned state used for the commercial vehicle application provided 45 hp of power. Thus enhanced, in August 1955 the Peugeot D3 was replaced by the Peugeot D4. The new van was virtually indistinguishable from the old one from the outside, unless the customer had paid extra for the side-door which could now be specified for the load area. Also new on the D4 were two ‚Äúbaguette- style‚Äù over-riders on the front bumper Dominique Milleron, La Peugeot 403 de mon p√®re, √©ditions E.T.A.I. which enabled keen eyed observers to differentiate the two versions (until 1960, when the over-riders disappeared). In October 1959 the D4 (like the 403) became available with a diesel engine, which was a major innovation at the time. In 1960 the power from the petrol engine was increased to 55 hp and the van was redesignated D4B. 1960 also saw a rearrangement of the exterior lights with the fitting of flashing direction indicators front and back. Further changes during the final five years were minor in nature, one of the more noteworthy being a small reduction, in 1963, of the number of bars on the front grill. A range of body types existed including those of a basic panel van, a minibus, and ambulance and horse-box. A relatively popular horse-box conversion was undertaken by the Th√©ault business at Avranches. Customers for the little minibus version included various French police forcesDominique Pagneux, Voitures de Police, Pr√©fecture de police de Paris, √©ditions E.P.A. and the French post office which used the vans for transporting postmen.Yves Lecouturier et Pierre-St√©phane Proust, La Poste automobile et les v√©hicules des P.T.T. 1897-1970, l'Union Marcophile.

The history of rail transport in Mauritania began in 1940, with the commencement of preparatory work for the construction of the Mauritania Railway, a single track, standard gauge line connecting a then proposed iron mine in Zouerate with the port of Nouadhibou, via Fderik and Choum. Construction of the line began in 1961 and was completed in 1963. Geography The line follows the northern border of Mauritania. Under the influence of the French colonial administration of what was then French West Africa, it was designed and built to European standards by the joint stock Societe Anonyme des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA). Since 1974, it has been owned by the parastatal Societe Nationale Industrielle et Mini√®re (SNIM). At about from Nouadhibou, the Mauritania Railway originally passed through the long and steeply graded Choum Tunnel, to avoid passing through part of the R√≠o de Oro territory in Western Sahara, which was then occupied by Spain. Since the end of the Western Sahara War in 1991, a diversion of the line has been built through the Polisario-controlled Free Zone of R√≠o de Oro, thus enabling the closure of the Choum Tunnel. The line has been used to carry passengers as well as iron ore. It was operated initially by French built Alstom Class CC 01-21 locomotives, but these have been gradually phased out since 1997 and replaced with EMD SDL40-2 motive power.

He later produced some of the earliest British television commercials. The majority of Bower‚Äôs work has been lost over time, due to both degradation and the purposeful melting down of the cellulose nitrate prints to extract small amounts of silver during the Second World war, leading to the placement of some of Bower‚Äôs projects in the British Film Institute's 75 Most Wanted lost films.  Biography  = Personal life = Dallas Bower was born on the 25 July 1907, in apartment 34 of Kensington Hall Gardens, London. Throughout his childhood Bower frequently visited the Old Royalty Cinema alongside his uncle, where they saw motion pictures such as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916), which Bower would later cite as a significant early influences that would inspire his future involvement in the film industry. Bower was educated at Willington Primary School in Putney, where he met Violet Florence Collings (1906-1999) who he married on the 18 November 1925 at the age of 18. Together they had two daughters and a son before separating in 1945. Bower continued his education at St John‚Äôs College Hurstpierpoint, where he studied classical literature in addition to contemporary technology. = Radio career = Bower was first introduced to radio by an older student at St John‚Äôs College who had been working on a small valve set. The pair would soon after establish an amateur radio station based in Bower‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs house in Putney. Following his graduation from St John‚Äôs College, Bower was employed by the Marconi Scientific Instrument Company, while at the same time he was selected to edit the radio theory and design journals Modern Wireless in 1925 and Experimental Wireless in 1926. As a prominent figure in the developing British radio industry he was invited to the Radio Society of Great Britain in 1926, where Bower personally heard Campbell Swinton lecture on the topic of cathode ray oscillography, the theory on which modern television transmissions are predicated on. Bower stated that the lecture made a ‚Äòprofound impression on him, directly leading to his collaborations with the British developer and radio physicist Robert Watson-Watt. Bower's meetings with Watt convinced him to enter the world of cinema, as the newfound technological advancements of the 1920s made the type of ambitious projects Bower envisioned feasible. = Early cinematic career = In 1927 Bower was hired as a sound recordist for British International Pictures (BIP), located in Elstree, London. In this position Bower recorded audio for a multitude of the company's projects, the most notable inclusions being Harry Lachman‚Äôs Under the Greenwood Tree (1929) and Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs first movie filmed with dialogue, Blackmail (1929). However, Dallas was forced to leave BIP the same year due to the Great Depression and the BPI's efforts to make the division more economical. In 1930 Stoll Pictures hired Dallas Bower to continue sound recording for the director and first university professor of film, Thorold Dickinson. Throughout this period Dickinson educated Bower on the principles of sound editing, which Bower utilised when given the opportunity to edit the scoring for the film Q-Ships (1930), a drama set in the First World War. The success of Q-Ships allowed him to quickly transition from sound editor into film editing, with his first project being Midnight Sister (1930) a comedy produced by the Path√© Film Company. In 1933 Reginal Smith, the founder of Riverside Studios, offered Bower a directorial position on the feature film The Path of Glory (1934) a satirical take on the war genre, however, the film was lost over time and is currently listed as one of the British Film Institute‚Äôs 75 Most Wanted lost films. The Path of Glory‚Äôs success put Bower into close association with Paul Czinner, a Hungarian director who had fled Nazi-Germany and required an assistant director to aid in communication. In the role of assistant director Bower assisted in the pre-production and on-set filming of Czinner‚Äôs films Escape me Never (1935) and As You Like It (1936), until their partnership ended when Bower joined the British Broadcasting Corporation. Czinner, P. & Bernstein‚ÄôS, H. (1937) Reviews: On the Screens Now - DREAMING LIPS. Picturegoer (Archive: 1932-1960) 7 (333) p.28, 30. [online]. Available from: http://search.proquest.com/docview/1771136634/. = Involvement with the British Broadcasting Company = In May 1936 Dallas Bower and Stephen Thomas were appointed as senior producers of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) by Gerald Cock, the first Director of Television for the BBC. Bower, who worked with Cock at BIP, was tasked with adapting ‚Äòhigh culture‚Äô to the developing mediums of mass communication, in the form of radio plays, short films and television shows. In this position Bower was accredited with the production of the programs Television Comes to London (1936), Television Demonstration Film (1937), Julius Caesar (1938), Checkmate (1938), and Rope (1939), the majority of which have been completely or partially lost to time. He had additionally been working on a screenplay for an adaption of Shakespeare‚Äôs Henry V, set in a Fascist state; however, the BBC halted all services before the script‚Äôs completion due to Nazi Germany‚Äôs invasion of Poland in September 1939. = World War II = Due to the outbreak of World War II, Bower was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Singles, where he was posted to a training brigade located in Whitby. However, relatively soon into the conflict Bower was transferred into the Ministry of Information, which produced propaganda for the British war effort. Bower‚Äôs role in the Ministry was equivalent to that of an executive producer. One of Bower‚Äôs first pieces of propaganda was Channel Incident (1940) a short film based on the Dunkirk Evacuation of British troops, reportedly Channel Incident was one of Prime Minister Winston Churchill‚Äôs favourite propaganda pieces. Hill, A. G. ‚ÄúBower, Dallas Gordon (1907-1999), Film.‚Äù Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 23 Sept. 2004. Web. In addition, he was responsible for the production of the radio play Alexander Nevsky‚Äô (1941), a project which was commissioned in correlation with the Soviet‚Äôs entry into WWII, as well as Columbus, another radio play to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the European's arrival in America. Over the course of the conflict Bower continued to work and reconfigure the script for Henry V, creating a more traditional appropriation. The final script was bought by Filippo del Giudice in 1944, causing Bower to resign from the Ministry to attach himself to the project. = Film career = Following his resignation from the Ministry of Information, Bower initially envisioned himself as the director for ‚ÄòHenry V‚Äô, however, due to a multitude of setbacks the lead actor Sir Laurence Oliver took his position, while Bower remained on the project as an Associate Producer. Bower contributed significantly to the film throughout production, writing the original screenplay, approving all further edits, sourcing the film‚Äôs composer, and securing the services of BAFTA award-winning cinematographer Robert Krasker. Ultimately, the film was a critical and financial success. Bower‚Äôs follow-up project was an Anglo-French adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, which he signed-on to after being approached by a French film crew in search of a British director. The film was only released in France and the United States to mixed audience reception and an underwhelming box office due, in part, to Walt Disney‚Äôs release of Alice in Wonderland at a similar time. Fifty years after the film's initial release the Museum of Modern Art in New York restored the film, which had been damaged due to negligent storage. Bower directed two more films: The Second Mrs Tanquerary (1952), which was filmed over the course of eight days in the Adelphi Theatre for under ¬£25,000, and Doorway to Suspicion. Both films received negative reviews and had a minimal impact at the box office. = Later career and death = After retiring from the director's chair, Bower began work on the production of the earliest television commercials under the company TV Advertising. Over this period Bower produced 80 commercials, directing 12 of them. He found the new avenue of work taxing, leading to his retirement in the mid-1960s. After retiring from commercials Bower was never again involved in production or directing, continuing to his death from heart failure on 18 October 1999.

He did his utmost to defend the town and its fortress that were under siege by Montenegrin and Serbian forces for seven months, stating \\"Shkodra is our fate or our grave, but not our shame\\". However, in the midst of the siege, Hasan Riza Pasha was assassinated by agents of Essad Pasha. Edith Durham wrote that after Hasan Riza had supper with Essad, he was shot dead a few yards away from the house by two men disguised as women. Osman Bali and Mehmed Kavaja, both servants of Essad Pasha, boasted afterwards that they had done the deed. The town crier proclaimed that nothing was to be said about the murder, and Essad now took command. Riza Pasha wanted to keep up the defense of the besieged city but Essad Pasha wanted to continue his secret negotiations with Montenegro, which were done through the counsel of Russia in Shkodra. Essad Pasha's plan was to hand over Shkodra to the Serbs and Montenegrins as the price for their support in his attempt to proclaim himself King of Albania.

Falls Road and Jones Falls Expressway mark the neighborhood's east and west boundaries. The back yards of homes on the north side of Appleby Avenue touch the community's north boundary at the Baltimore County line. Its southern limit is Northern Parkway. History Most of the homes in this tiny, secluded community are two-story, wood-frame houses built by Charles Mattfeldt from 1886 to the mid-1890s. Mattfeldt rented the houses to employees of the mills located along the Jones Falls. A portion of the neighborhood was razed by the City of Baltimore after several houses on Mattfeldt Avenue were flooded by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The empty lots became the neighborhood's two open areas. As the mills along the Jones Falls closed in the late 20th century, Sabina Mattfeldt transformed from a neighborhood of factory workers into a community of artists and musicians. Its residents have maintained and restored much of the original architecture in their homes, which still have round-top attic windows. Significant landmarks Most of the residential properties in the community are located in the southern half of the neighborhood on Mattfeldt Avenue. Meadowbrook Aquatic & Fitness Center is located between these homes and Kelly Avenue, opposite the post office on Cottonworth Avenue. Build in 1930 by George Morris, Meadowbrook Aquatic serves as a venue for the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and was the home training facility for Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps. Whole Foods Market operates a grocery store to the north of Kelly Avenue on Smith Avenue. Asbury Park fills the area between Whole Foods Market and the houses on Appleby Avenue. Public transportation The Route 27 (MTA Maryland) bus crosses through the northern end of the neighborhood on Kelly Avenue, then travels along Falls Road on its way to Downtown Baltimore. After crossing the Jones Falls Expressway on Kelly Avenue, it stops at the Mount Washington Light Rail Stop and continues to the Rogers Avenue Metro station. Route 60 (MTA Maryland) also passes through the neighborhood on Kelly Avenue as it travels between the Reisterstown Road Plaza Metro station and Brooklandville, Maryland.

Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit, and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a police state. In June 1944, a popular pro-democracy movement led by university students and labor organizations forced Ubico to resign. He appointed a three- person military junta to take his place, led by Federico Ponce Vaides. This junta continued Ubico's oppressive policies, until it was toppled in a military coup led by Jacobo √Årbenz in October 1944, an event also known as the \\"October Revolution\\". The coup leaders formed a junta which swiftly called for open elections. These elections were won in a landslide by Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo, a progressive professor of philosophy who had become the face of the popular movement. He implemented a moderate program of social reform, including a widely successful literacy campaign and a largely free election process, although illiterate women were not given the vote and communist parties were banned. Following the end of Ar√©valo's presidency in 1951, Jacobo √Årbenz was elected to the presidency in a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Ar√©valo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land- holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. √Årbenz's policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for the overthrow of √Årbenz, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that √Årbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power at the head of a military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians. Background =Early 20th Century= Manuel Estrada Cabrera, President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920. Cabrera granted large concessions to the American United Fruit Company Prior to the Spanish invasion in 1524, the population of Guatemala was almost exclusively Maya. The Spanish conquest created a system of wealthy European landowners overseeing a labor force composed of slaves and bonded laborers. However, the community lands of the indigenous population remained in their control until the late 19th century. At this point, rising global demand for coffee made its export a significant source of income for the government. As a result, the state supported the coffee growers by passing legislation that took land away from the Indian population, as well as relaxing labor laws so that bonded labor could be used on the plantations. The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) was one of many foreign companies that acquired large tracts of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Casta√±eda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate. =Dictatorship of Jorge Ubico= Jorge Ubico, the dictator of Guatemala from 1931 to 1944. He passed laws allowing landowners to use lethal force to defend their property Ubico had made statements supporting the labor movement when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, and replaced it with a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys. Ubico had great admiration for the fascist leaders of Europe, such as Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini. However, he saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico. He made a concerted effort to gain American support; when the US declared war on Germany and Japan in 1941, Ubico followed suit, and acting on American instructions arrested all people of German descent in Guatemala. He permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the Panama Canal. Like his predecessors, he made large concessions to the United Fruit Company, granting it hectares of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port. He later released the company from this obligation as well, citing the economic crisis. Since its entry into Guatemala, the UFC had expanded its land-holdings by displacing the peasantry and converting their farmland into banana plantations. This process accelerated under Ubico, whose government did nothing to stop it. =June 1944 general strike= The onset of World War II increased economic unrest in Guatemala. Ubico responded by cracking down more fiercely on any form of protest or dissent. In 1944, popular revolt broke out in neighboring El Salvador, which briefly toppled dictator Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez. However, he quickly returned to power, leading to a flood of exiled El Salvadorian revolutionaries moving to Guatemala. This coincided with a series of protests at the university in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on 22 June 1944. The protesters, who by this point included many middle-class members in addition to students and workers, called for a general strike, and presented an ultimatum to Ubico the next day, demanding the reinstatement of the constitution. They also presented him a petition signed by 311 of the most prominent Guatemalan citizens. Ubico sent the police to disrupt the protests by firing on them, and declared martial law. = Ubico resigns and appoints an interim government = Clashes between protesters and the military continued for a week, during which the revolt gained momentum. At the end of June, Ubico submitted his resignation to the National Assembly, leading to huge celebrations in the streets. The resignation of Ubico did not restore democracy. Ubico appointed three generals, Federico Ponce Vaides, Eduardo Villagr√°n Ariza, and Buenaventura Pineda, to a junta which would lead the provisional government. A few days later, Ponce Vaides persuaded the congress to appoint him interim president. Ponce pledged to hold free elections soon, while at the same time suppressing the protests. Press freedom was suspended, arbitrary detentions continued, and memorial services for slain revolutionaries were prohibited. However, the protests had grown to the point where the government could not stamp them out, and rural areas also began organizing against the dictatorship. The government began using the police to intimidate the indigenous population to keep the junta in power through the forthcoming election. This resulted in growing support for an armed revolution among some sections of the populace. By now, the army was disillusioned with the junta, and progressives within it had begun to plot a coup. On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, the editor of El Imparcial, the main opposition newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters reaching out to the leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.  October revolution  By mid-October, several different plans to overthrow the junta had been set in motion by various factions of the pro-democracy movement, including teachers, students, and progressive factions of the army. On 19 October, the government learned of one of these conspiracies. That same day, a small group of army officers launched a coup, led by Francisco Javier Arana and Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n. Although the coup had initially been plotted by √Årbenz and Major Aldana Sandoval, Sandoval had prevailed upon Arana to join them; however, Sandoval himself did not participate in the coup attempt, and was described as having \\"lost his nerve\\". They were joined the next day by other factions of the army and the civilian population. Initially, the battle went against the revolutionaries, but after an appeal for support their ranks were swelled by unionists and students, and they eventually subdued the police and army factions loyal to Ponce Vaides. On October 20, the next day, Ponce Vaides surrendered unconditionally. Jacobo √Årbenz, Jorge Toriello, and Francisco Arana, who oversaw the transition to a civilian government after the October RevolutionPonce Vaides was allowed to leave the country safely, as was Ubico himself. The military junta was replaced by another three-person junta consisting of √Årbenz, Arana, and an upper-class youth named Jorge Toriello, who had played a significant role in the protests. Although Arana had come to the military conspiracy relatively late, his defection had brought the powerful Guardia de Honor (Honor Guard) over to the revolutionaries, and for this crucial role he was rewarded with a place on the junta. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly. The resignation of Ponce Vaides and the creation of the junta has been considered by scholars to be the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution. However, the revolutionary junta did not immediately threaten the interests of the landed elite. Two days after Ponce Vaides' resignation, a violent protest erupted at Patzic√≠a, a small Indian hamlet. The junta responded with swift brutality, silencing the protest. The dead civilians included women and children. =Election of Ar√©valo= Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo Bermejo was born into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school teacher for a brief while, and then earned a scholarship to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovaci√≥n Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Ar√©valo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, the fact that he had chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform. The subsequent elections took place in December 1944, and were broadly considered free and fair, although only literate men were given the vote. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. Ar√©valo's closest challenger was Adri√°n Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. The ballots were tallied on 19 December 1944, and Ar√©valo won in a landslide, receiving more than four times as many ballots as the other candidates combined. Presidency of Ar√©valo Ar√©valo took office on 15 March 1945, inheriting a country with numerous social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% of the population was illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent. =Ideology= Ar√©valo identified his ideology as \\"spiritual socialism\\". He held the belief that the only way to alleviate the backwardness of most Guatemalans was through a paternalistic government. He was strongly opposed to classical Marxism, and believed in a capitalist society that was regulated to ensure that its benefits went to the entire population. Ar√©valo's ideology was reflected in the new constitution that the Guatemalan assembly ratified soon after his inauguration, which was one of the most progressive in Latin America. It mandated suffrage for all but illiterate women, a decentralization of power, and provisions for a multiparty system. Communist parties were, however, forbidden. The constitution and Ar√©valo's socialist ideology became the basis for much of the reform enacted under Ar√©valo and (later) Jacobo √Årbenz. Although the US government would later portray the ideology of the revolution as radical communist, it did not in fact represent a major shift leftward, and was staunchly anti-communist. Ar√©valo's economic vision for the country was centered around private enterprise. =Labor movement= The revolution in 1944 left many of the biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Ar√©valo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement to the point where Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Ar√©valo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution. The communist movement was also strengthened by the release of those of its leaders who had been imprisoned by Ubico. Among them were Miguel M√°rmol, V√≠ctor Manuel Guti√©rrez, and Graciela Garc√≠a, the latter unusual for being a woman in a movement that women were discouraged from participating in. The communists began to organize in the capital, and established a school for workers, known as the Escuela Claridad, or the Clarity School, which taught reading, writing, and also helped organize unions. Six months after the school was established, President Ar√©valo closed the school down, and deported all the leaders of the movement who were not Guatemalan. However, the communist movement survived, mostly by its dominance of the teacher's union. Ar√©valo's response toward the non- communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces with fewer than 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Ar√©valo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts on the part of employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organizaci√≥n Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a union that took a strongly anti-communist stance. Despite the powerful opposition, by 1947 the labor unions had managed to organize enough support to force the congress to pass a new labor code. This law was revolutionary in many ways; it forbade discrimination in salary levels on the basis of \\"age, race, sex, nationality, religious beliefs, or political affiliation\\". It created a set of health and safety standards in the workplace, and standardized an eight-hour working day and a 45-hour working week, although the congress succumbed to pressure from the plantation lobby and exempted plantations from this provision. The code also required plantation owners to construct primary schools for the children of their workers, and expressed a general commitment to \\"dignifying\\" the position of workers. Although many of these provisions were never enforced, the creation of administrative mechanisms for this law in 1948 allowed several of its provisions to be systematically enforced. The law as a whole had a huge positive impact on worker rights in the country, including raising the average wages by a factor of three or more. =Foreign relations= The Ar√©valo government attempted to support democratic ideals abroad as well. One of Ar√©valo's first actions was to break diplomatic relations with the government of Spain under dictator Francisco Franco. At two inter-American conferences in the year after his election, Ar√©valo recommended that the republics in Latin America not recognize and support authoritarian regimes. This initiative was defeated by the dictatorships supported by the United States, such as the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. In response, Ar√©valo broke off diplomatic ties with the Nicaraguan government and with the government of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Frustrated by the lack of results from working with the other Latin American governments, Ar√©valo began to support the Caribbean Legion, which sought to replace dictatorships with democracies across Latin America, by force if necessary. This led to the administration being labelled as communist by the dictatorial governments in the region. The Ar√©valo government also floated the idea of a Central American Federation, as being the only way that a democratic government could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic Central American countries, but was rejected by all except Casta√±eda Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 the Castro government was toppled in a military coup led by √ìscar Osorio. =1949 coup attempt= As the highest-ranking military officer in the October Revolution, Francisco Arana had led the three-man junta that formed the interim government after the coup. He was opposed to handing over power to a civilian government, first seeking to postpone the 1944 election, and then to annul it. In return for allowing Ar√©valo to become president, Arana was granted the newly created position of \\"chief of the armed forces\\", ranked above the minister of defense. The position had a six-year term, and controlled all military appointments. In December 1945, Ar√©valo was involved in a motoring accident which left him seriously injured. Fearing a military coup, the leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR) made a pact with Arana, in which the party agreed to support his candidacy in the 1950 elections in return for a promise to refrain from a coup. Arana's support began to be solicited by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Ar√©valo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined to get involved with politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back √Årbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. On 16 July 1949, Arana delivered an ultimatum to Ar√©valo, demanding the expulsion of all of √Årbenz's supporters from the cabinet and the military; he threatened a coup if his demands were not met. Ar√©valo informed √Årbenz and other progressive leaders of the ultimatum, who all agreed that Arana should be exiled. Two days later, Ar√©valo and Arana had another meeting; on the way back, Arana's convoy was intercepted by a small force led by √Årbenz. A shootout ensued, killing three men, including Arana. Arana's supporters in the military rose up in revolt, but they were leaderless, and by the next day the rebels asked for negotiations. The coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded. Many of Arana's supporters, including Carlos Castillo Armas, were exiled. The details of the incident were not made public. Presidency of √Årbenz =Election= √Årbenz's role as defense minister had already made him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950, the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that √Årbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. This announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, as well as from labor unions. √Årbenz had only a couple of significant challengers in the election, in a field of ten candidates. One of these was Jorge Garc√≠a Granados, who was supported by some members of the upper-middle class who felt the revolution had gone too far. Another was Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, who had been a general under Ubico, and who had the support of the hardline opponents of the revolution. During his campaign, √Årbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Ar√©valo. The election was held on 15 November 1950, and √Årbenz won more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were free and fair with the exception of the disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. √Årbenz was inaugurated as president on 15 March 1951. =√Årbenz's personal background= √Årbenz was born in 1913 into a middle-class family of Swiss heritage. In 1935 he had graduated from the Escuela Polit√©cnica, Guatemala's national military academy, with excellent grades, and had subsequently become an officer in the Guatemalan army under Ubico. As an officer, √Årbenz himself had been required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners. This process had radicalized him, and he had begun to form links to the labor movement. In 1938 he had met and married Mar√≠a Villanova, who was also interested in social reform, and who became a significant influence on him and a national figure in her own right. Another strong influence on him was Jos√© Manuel Fortuny, a well-known Guatemalan communist, who was one of his main advisers during his government. In 1944, disgusted with Ubico's authoritarian regime, he and his fellow officers had begun plotting against the government. When Ubico resigned in 1944, √Årbenz had witnessed Ponce Vaides intimidate the congress into naming him president. Highly offended by this, √Årbenz plotted against Ponce Vaides, and was one of the military leaders of the coup that toppled him, in addition to having been one of the few officers in the revolution who had formed and maintained connections to the popular civilian movement. =Agrarian reform= The biggest component of √Årbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. √Årbenz drafted the bill himself with the help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 17 June 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers, who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own. √Årbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the shortage of capital more acute. The official title of the agrarian reform bill was Decree 900. It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than . If the estates were between and in size, uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use. The owners were compensated with government bonds, the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated. The value of the land itself was the value that the owners had declared in their tax returns in 1952. The redistribution was organized by local committees that included representatives from the landowners, the laborers, and the government. Of the nearly 350,000 private land-holdings, only 1710 were affected by expropriation. The law itself was cast in a moderate capitalist framework; however, it was implemented with great speed, which resulted in occasional arbitrary land seizures. There was also some violence, directed at land-owners, as well as at peasants that had minor landholdings of their own. By June 1954, 1.4 million acres of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had received land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit to the people who received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on 7 July 1953, and by June 1954 it had disbursed more than $9 million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225 US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, √Årbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. The law also included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities. Contrary to the predictions made by the detractors of the government, the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity, and to an increase in cultivated area. Purchases of farm machinery also increased. Overall, the law resulted in a significant improvement in living standards for many thousands of peasant families, the majority of whom were indigenous people. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that the injustices corrected by the law were far greater than the injustice of the relatively few arbitrary land seizures. Historian Greg Grandin stated that the law was flawed in many respects; among other things, it was too cautious and deferential to the planters, and it created communal divisions among peasants. Nonetheless, it represented a fundamental power shift in favor of those that had been marginalized before then. United Fruit Company =History= The United Fruit Company had been formed in 1899 by the merger of two large American corporations. The new company had major holdings of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of US$215 million and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions in the country that allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic Ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were US$65 million, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government. =Impact of the revolution= Due to its long association with Ubico's government, the United Fruit Company (UFC) was seen as an impediment to progress by Guatemalan revolutionaries after 1944. This image was worsened by the company's discriminatory policies towards its colored workers. Thanks to its position as the country's largest landowner and employer, the reforms of Ar√©valo's government affected the UFC more than other companies. Among other things, the labor code passed by the government allowed its workers to strike when their demands for higher wages and job security were not met. The company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and refused to negotiate with the numerous sets of strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws. The company's labor troubles were compounded in 1952 when Jacobo √Årbenz passed Decree 900, the agrarian reform law. Of the that the company owned, 15% were being cultivated; the rest of the land, which was idle, came under the scope of the agrarian reform law. =Lobbying efforts= The United Fruit Company responded with intensive lobbying of members of the United States government, leading many US congressmen and senators to criticize the Guatemalan government for not protecting the interests of the company. The Guatemalan government responded by saying that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that \\"To the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation's welfare.\\" In 1953, of uncultivated land was expropriated by the government, which offered the company compensation at the rate of 2.99 US dollars to the acre, twice what the company had paid when it bought the property. More expropriation occurred soon after, bringing the total to over ; the government offered compensation to the company at the rate at which the UFC had valued its own property for tax purposes. This resulted in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had close ties to the company. The company had begun a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired public relations expert Edward Bernays, who ran a concerted effort to portray the company as the victim of the Guatemalan government for several years. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower had been elected in 1952. These included commissioning a research study on Guatemala from a firm known to be hawkish, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of \\"exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories\\". The report nonetheless had a significant impact on the Congressmen that it was sent to. Overall, the company spent over a half-million dollars to influence both lawmakers and members of the public in the US that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown. CIA instigated coup d'√©tat =Political motivations= In addition to the lobbying of the United Fruit Company, several other factors also led the United States to launch the coup that toppled √Årbenz in 1954. During the years of the Guatemalan Revolution, military coups occurred in several other Central American countries that brought firmly anti-communist governments to power. Army officer Major Oscar Osorio won staged elections in El Salvador in 1950, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista took power in 1952. Honduras, where the land- holdings of the United Fruit Company were the most extensive, had been ruled by an anti-communist government sympathetic to the United States since 1932. These developments created tension between the other governments and √Årbenz, which was exacerbated by Ar√©valo's support for the Caribbean Legion. This support also worried the United States and the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. According to US historian Richard Immerman, during the beginning of the Cold War, the US and the CIA tended to assume that everybody who opposed it was a communist. Thus, despite Ar√©valo's ban of the communist party, important figures in the US government were already predisposed to believe that the revolutionary government had been infiltrated by communists, and was a danger to the US. During the years of the revolution, several reports and memoranda were circulated amongst US government agencies that furthered this belief. =Operation PBFortune= Although the administration of Harry Truman had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, at least until the end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by √Årbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFortune. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission to go ahead with the plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, the right- wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. =Operation PBSuccess= John Foster Dulles and US President Dwight Eisenhower In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was elected president of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had included a pledge for a more active anti-communist policy. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Both of these factors made Eisenhower predisposed to supporting the overthrow of √Årbenz. The CIA operation to overthrow Jacobo √Årbenz, code-named Operation PBSuccess, was authorized by Eisenhower in August 1953. The operation was granted a budget of 2.7 million dollars for \\"psychological warfare and political action\\". The total budget has been estimated at between 5 and 7 million dollars, and the planning employed over 100 CIA agents. The CIA planning included drawing up lists of people within √Årbenz's government to be assassinated if the coup were to be carried out. Manuals of assassination techniques were compiled, and lists were also made of people whom the junta would dispose of. After considering several candidates to lead the coup, including Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, the CIA settled on Carlos Castillo Armas. The US state department also embarked on a campaign to ensure that other countries would not sympathize with the Guatemalan government, by linking it to communism and the Soviet Union. By 1954 √Årbenz had become desperate for weapons, and decided to acquire them secretly from Czechoslovakia, which would have been the first time that a Soviet bloc country shipped weapons to the Americas. The shipment of these weapons acted as the final spur for the CIA to launch its coup. =Invasion= On 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led a convoy of trucks carrying 480 men across the border from Honduras into Guatemala. The weapons had come from the CIA, which had also trained the men in camps in Nicaragua and Honduras. Since his army was badly outnumbered by the Guatemalan army, the CIA plan required Castillo Armas to camp within the Guatemalan border, while it mounted a psychological campaign to convince the Guatemalan people and government that Armas' victory was a fait accompli. This campaign included using Catholic priests to give anti-communist sermons, strafing several towns using CIA aircraft, and placing a naval blockade around the country. It also involved dropping leaflets by airplane through the country, and carrying out a radio broadcast entitled \\"The Voice of Liberation\\" which announced that Guatemalan exiles led by Castillo Armas were shortly about to liberate the country. The military force led by Castillo Armas attempted to make forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to √Årbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns for psychological effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force were found to be inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident by the Security Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, √Årbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that √Årbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas. Knowing that he could not fight on without the support of the army, Jacobo √Årbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would roll back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution. =Aftermath= Ixil Maya carrying exhumed bodies of their relatives killed in the Guatemalan Civil War Following the coup, hundreds of peasant leaders were rounded up and executed. Historian Greg Grandin has stated that \\"There is general consensus today among academics and Guatemalan intellectuals that 1954 signaled the beginning of what would become the most repressive state in the hemisphere\\". Following the coup and the establishment of the military dictatorship, a series of leftist insurgencies began in the countryside, frequently with a large degree of popular support, which triggered the Guatemalan Civil War that lasted until 1996. The largest of these movements was led by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, which at its largest point had 270,000 members. Two-hundred thousand (200,000) civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. Historians estimate that 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.

Dresser (February 12, 1838 - 1893) was an early leader in the New Thought movement. Along with his wife Annetta, Dresser was the first proponent of the \\"Quimby System of Mental Treatment of Diseases\\", named after Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. Julius and Annetta were also the parents of prolific New Thought author Horatio Dresser, who, along with them, led a long-time dispute against Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy over whether she used Quimby's teaching unattributed in her writing.  Biography  Julius Dresser was born February 12, 1838, in Portland, Maine. As a young person he entered Waterville College to become a minister in the Calvinistic Baptist Church. In 1860, while still in college, Dresser became sick and went to see Quimby for his reputed healing power. He was healed, and became an advocate of Quimby's practice, which he called the \\"Quimby System of Mental Treatment of Diseases\\". In 1863, Dresser met Annetta Seabury at Quimby's office. They married in 1863. Their first son, Horatio, was born in 1866.  Profession  In 1866, at the age of 28, Dresser become editor of a Portland newspaper. Later that year the family moved to Webster, Massachusetts, where Dresser edited the Webster Times. That year Quimby died, too, and soon after Julius moved to California. In 1882 Dresser and his wife moved to Boston, where they set up an office to practice Quimby's system of mental healing. In 1883 they began teaching classes, and they became successful through this work. = Controversy = When Quimby died in 1866 another student of his wrote to Dresser and implored him to continue Quimby's practice by assuming leadership of the burgeoning movement. However, Dresser replied in a letter that he was disenchanted with Quimby's method, and soon after he moved away. In the meantime his petitioner, Mary Baker Eddy, went about forming the set of beliefs which eventually became the basis of Christian Science. In 1882 Dresser studied Eddy's practice through the teaching of Edward J. Arens, a former Christian Scientist. He immediately and publicly accused her of stealing Quimby's ideas without crediting him. Dresser first refuted Eddy's claims in his 1887 book, The True History of Mental Science. The Dressers also laid claim to Quimby's teachings by formalizing the New Thought movement and promoting it nationally. In the 1890s Dresser took Eddy to court. While they lost, the family continued its protest against her with his wife continuing after his death in, The Philosophy of P.P. Quimby, which was published in 1895. In 1919, Dresser's son Horatio published the book, A History of the New Thought Movement, in which he also laid claim against Eddy's authenticity.Dresser, H.W.

The purpose of the Sacramento Seminar is to provide undergraduate students from various California institutions with hands-on exposure to California's political system. During the seminar, students participate in panel discussions which are held in the California State Capitol, where they engage in political discourse with prominent government officials, legislators, lobbyists, fellows, and scholars from across the state. The panel discussions give students the opportunity to ask these distinguished guests questions pertaining to a variety of topics. Throughout the seminar, students are encouraged to introduce themselves and meet with public officials and staff to seek personal career advice. The Center plays a significant role in organizing and coordinating the Sacramento Seminar for both the students and professors who attend annually. =Undergraduate research symposium= StudyLA undergraduate student researchers participate in the 2012 Undergraduate Research Symposium at LMU The Undergraduate Research Symposium invites undergraduate students formally to present displays of faculty-mentored research and other creative activity in all academic areas.

To mitigate the controversies surrounding exit poll methodology, the Center assembled a team of researchers who implemented a sampling technique known as the \\"racially stratified homogenous precinct approach\\" to accurately sample voters in the city of Los Angeles. Research conducted at the Center has shown that the city of Los Angeles is racially segregated, thus voters are more likely voting in racially homogenous precincts. The key component to the stratified approach is the selection of racially and ethnically homogenous precincts throughout the city of Los Angeles. The Center has conducted exit polls for the 2005 mayoral election, 2008 presidential election, and 2010 gubernatorial election. =Los angeles riots quinquennial resident survey= In observance of the Los Angeles riots and disturbances of 1992, CSLA sponsors cross-sectional phone surveys of Los Angeles residents to study their overall perceived attitudes and concerns towards the city of Los Angeles. The CSLA Riots Anniversary Survey is conducted every 5th anniversary marking the L.A. riots and disturbances of 1992. The Riots Anniversary Survey provides data on LA residents' perceptions of race/ethnic relations, the Los Angeles Police Department, local government and neighborhood relations, the likelihood for future riots to occur, the overall direction of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles resident quality of life.

This results in a twitch which properties are driven by two mechanisms: motor unit recruitment and rate coding. Both mechanisms are affected with aging. For instance, the number of motor units may decrease, the size of the motor units, i.e. the number of muscle fibers they innervate may increase, the frequency at which the action potentials are triggered may be reduced. Consequently, force production is generally impaired in old adults.Neuromechanics of human movement, chapter 6 Single-joint system function; Roger M. Enoka. Aging is associated with decreases in muscle mass and strength. These decreases may be partially due to losses of alpha motor neurons. By the age of 70, these losses occur in both proximal and distal muscles. In biceps brachii and brachialis, old adults show decreased strength (by 1/3) correlated with a reduction in the number of motor units (by 1/2). Old adults show evidence that remaining motor units may become larger as motor units innervate collateral muscle fibers. In first dorsal interosseus, almost all motor units are recruited at moderate rate coding, leading to 30-40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Motor unit discharge rates measured at 50% MVC are not significantly different in the young subjects from those observed in the old adults. However, for the maximal effort contractions, there is an appreciable difference in discharge rates between the two age groups. Discharge rates obtained at 100% of MVC are 64% smaller in the old adults than in the young subjects: 31.1 ¬± 11.8 impulses/s in the old subjects, 50.9 ¬± 19.5 impulses/s in the young subjects. Isometric strength and physical cross-sectional area of the elbow flexors and elbow extensors are reduced in old compared with young men. The normalized force (maximal voluntary force to the size of the muscle producing the force) of the elbow extensors is the same for old and young people. The normalized force for the elbow flexors is reduced in the old men compared to the young men. The lower normalized force of the elbow flexors may be due to an increase in agonist-antagonist muscles coactivation. Compared to the young group, the old group has lower dorsiflexors isometric torque at all angles, has lower knee extensors isometric torque at angles >90¬∞. The impairment in force production is muscle specific. During dynamic exercise, the old group requires more time to reach a target velocity and is less able to attain high velocities. The slowing of voluntary contractile speed with age seems to play a role in the loss of dynamic torque. Sensory function The detection of a stimulus by a receptor in the afferent nerve terminals (vs efferent nerve terminals) is useful to protect the body against unexpected disturbances. Studies in post-mortem subjects support that the thickness of muscle spindle capsules increases with age. There is a slight decrease in the number of intrafusal fibers in the oldest subjects. Some spindles show changes consistent with denervation associated with grouped denervation atrophy. Age- related changes are observed in fine structure of spindle nerve innervation in the form of axonal swelling and expanded/abnormal endplates. When subject to a task of proprioception, the elderly show increased cocontraction of agonist- antagonist muscles, perhaps to increase gamma drive and spindle sensitivity. It is believed to be used for postural control. Despite a cocontraction strategy, old adults have higher reaction time and also make greater errors in estimating the position of their ankle. The elderly subjects with greater errors for the dynamic position sense also perform poorly on the single limb stance eyes closed test. Old adults sway more than young adults while maintaining upright standing posture, especially with eyes closed with a narrow base of support. Young adults show ‚Äúresourcefulness‚Äù by shifting from one sensory input (vision) to another (somatosensory) whereas old adults do not rely on the variety of sensory inputs but rather respond by stiffening their ankles across tasks (wide base of support vs narrow base of support, eyes open vs eyes closed). Sensory receptors can initiate rapid responses to perturbations thanks to short-latency connections between afferent innervations and motor units. Yet, aging results in decreases in motor conduction velocities. This may be due to losses of the fastest conducting motor units. There is also evidence of slowing of both fast and slow conducting axons which can be explained by decreases in axon diameter through demyelination, by reduction of internodal length. Some studies suggest an overall decrease in the number of myelinated fibers. Aging results in slowed reaction time in an aiming task for both eye and hand movements. Comparisons between young and old adults who have to follow a target only with their eyes or with a laser in their hand, show that parameters indicative of motor function such as velocity, duration, and amplitude of initial movement are unchanged. However the duration of corrective movement is longer for old adults. It suggests an impairment to sensory system. Walking gait When confronted to an unexpected slip or trip during walking, compared to young adults, old adults have a less effective balance strategy: smaller and slower postural muscle responses, altered temporal and spatial organization of the postural response, agonist-antagonist muscles coactivation and greater upper trunk instability. Comparing control and slip conditions, after the perturbation, young adults have a longer stride length, a longer stride duration, and the same walk velocity whereas old adults have a shorter stride length, the same stride duration, and a lower walk velocity. In an experiment, for a single-task walking, 24% of old adults have gait speed <0.8 m/s but for a dual-task of walking and talking, 62% of old adults have gait speed <0.8 m/s. In practical terms, this means that a large proportion of healthy community-dwelling old adults may not walk fast enough to safely cross the street while simultaneously having a conversation. These findings support the assertion that generating spontaneous speech is highly demanding on cognitive resources and suggest that real world dual-task effects on gait may be underestimated by reaction time tasks. Fatigue resistance Compared to young adults, old adults exhibit muscle fatigue (peripheral fatigue) resistance during sustained isometric maximal voluntary contraction, but they show greater supraspinal fatigue at start of sustained task, and during recovery. The first observation reflects changes in fiber type ratio; with aging the proportion of type I muscle fibers which are adapted to long effort becomes greater. The second observation is likely a result of cumulative effects of exercise on the central nervous system. For the knee extensors, old adults produce less torque during dynamic or isometric maximal voluntary contractions than young adults. The mechanisms controlling fatigue in the elderly during isometric contractions are not the same as those that influence fatigue during dynamic contractions, while young adults keep the same strategy. The knee extensors of healthy old adults fatigue less during isometric contractions than do those of young adults who had similar levels of habitual physical activity. In contrast, there are no differences between age groups in the fatigue during dynamic contractions. Speed, dexterity For old adults, the decreased saccadic accuracy, prolonged latency, and reduced saccadic velocity may be explained by cerebral cortical degeneration with age. Old adults show reduced amplitude of primary saccades and they generally more saccades to reach fixation. Old adults show significant delay of saccades in all conditions (predictable amplitude and time target steps, unpredictable amplitude target steps, unpredictable time target steps). Age-related slowing is only evident for predictable targets; however other studies have shown otherwise but noted higher variance in speed of old adults. Instructed to look either toward (pro-saccade task) or away from (anti-saccade task) an eccentric target under different conditions of fixation, for young children (5¬±8 years of age) a long time elapses between the apparition of the target and the onset of the eye movement (Saccadic Reaction Time). Young adults (20¬±30 years of age) typically have the fastest SRTs. Elderly subjects (60¬±79 years of age) have slower SRTs and longer duration saccades than any other age groups. Old adults exhibit reductions in manual dexterity which is observed through changes in fingertip force when gripping and/or lifting. Compared to young adults, old adults show an increase in grip force and safety margins (minimum force necessary to prevent a slip). These increases can be explained by skin slipperiness or it may be the result of declining cutaneous information. Force increases are not associated with impaired capacity to modulate fingertip forces smoothly. There is no evidence that old adults were less able to program fingertips based on the memory of a preceding lift. The prismatic grasp (4 fingers in opposition to thumb) which is common in everyday activities, involves the organization of the digits into specific tasks and the balance of force/moment production by individual digits. Old adults exhibit an impairment in finger and hand force production. They show excessive grip force which could be related to higher moments produced by antagonist fingers. Both can be viewed as energetically suboptimal but more stable performance. Old adults often show heightened antagonist muscle coactivation during goal directed movement. Contractions at moderate-to-high force often show activation of other ipsilateral and contralateral muscles. When the intensity of contralateral activity is sufficient to produce movement, this is called ‚Äúmirror movement‚Äù. When asked to follow a unilateral task, young and old adults show concurrent activity in contralateral muscle but it is greater in old adults. Contralateral activity is greater for isometric than for anisometric contractions. Contralateral force is greater for eccentric than concentric contractions. Training consequences Type I muscle fiber characteristics (area, number of capillary contacts, fiber area/capillary contacts) of the vastus lateralis are unaffected by age. The old men normal fit or trained have smaller type II muscle fiber areas and fewer capillaries surrounding these fibers than do the young men. The capillary supply per unit type II fiber area is not affected by age but is enhanced by training. The old trained men have succinate dehydrogenase activities within their type IIa muscle fibers similar to those in young men and twofold higher than in old normal fit men. Neural changes like reduced motor unit discharge rates, increased variability of motor unit discharge activity, altered recruitment and derecruitment behavior mediate modifications in muscle control. On the other hand, physiological deleterious factors including motor unit loss, increased motor unit innervation ratios also affect muscle force. Through strength training, old adults can significantly improve their force control. The rapid adaptation suggests modifications in motor unit activation, increased excitability of motoneuron pool, and decreased antagonist cocontraction. Heavy resistance and sensorimotor trainings result in increased maximum voluntary contraction and rate force development. But sensorimotor training shows more positive adaptations in postural reflexes, which is likely due to training of sensory reception/processing, central integration of afferent information, transformation of that information into adequate efferent response. The decreased onset latency and increased magnitude of reflex response with sensorimotor training is associated with increased ankle joint stiffness during perturbations. When asked to reach a given level of force at a certain moment in time without any visual feedback, old adults are less accurate than young adults. With the practice of goal-directed contractions, old adults can improve the accuracy of novel motor tasks (isometric or dynamic) though their strategy differs from the strategy used by young adults. For both age groups, the greatest improvements in accuracy occur at the beginning of practice. Old adults are able to improve the modulation of grasping forces after motor practice. Unexpectedly, motor practice fails to reduce grasping performance losses under the dual-task conditions but motor practice reduces the decline in cognitive performance under dual-task conditions. Therefore, motor practice seems to free up cognitive resources that were previously monitoring motor performance and old adults seemed to use these resources to improve their cognitive performance under dual-task conditions.

The segment Œì of the boundary of Œ© which is not known at the outset of the problem is the free boundary. FBs arise in various mathematical models encompassing applications that ranges from physical to economical, financial and biological phenomena, where there is an extra effect of the medium. This effect is in general a qualitative change of the medium and hence an appearance of a phase transition: ice to water, liquid to crystal, buying to selling (assets), active to inactive (biology), blue to red (coloring games), disorganized to organized (self-organizing criticality. An interesting aspect of such a criticality is the so-called sandpile dynamic (or Internal DLA). The most classical example is the melting of ice: Given a block of ice, one can solve the heat equation given appropriate initial and boundary conditions to determine its temperature. But, if in any region the temperature is greater than the melting point of ice, this domain will be occupied by liquid water instead. The boundary formed from the ice/liquid interface is controlled dynamically by the solution of the PDE.  Two-phase Stefan problems  The melting of ice is a Stefan problem for the temperature field T, which is formulated as follows. Consider a medium occupying a region Œ© consisting of two phases, phase 1 which is present when T > 0 and phase 2 which is present when T < 0\\\\. Let the two phases have thermal diffusivities Œ±1 and Œ±2. For example, the thermal diffusivity of water is 1.4√ó10‚àí7 m2/s, while the diffusivity of ice is 1.335√ó10‚àí6 m2/s. In the regions consisting solely of one phase, the temperature is determined by the heat equation: in the region T > 0, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = abla\\\\cdot(\\\\alpha_1 abla T) + Q while in the region T < 0, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = abla\\\\cdot (\\\\alpha_2 abla T) + Q. This is subject to appropriate conditions on the (known) boundary of Œ©; Q represents sources or sinks of heat. Let Œìt be the surface where T = 0 at time t; this surface is the interface between the two phases. Let ŒΩ denote the unit outward normal vector to the second (solid) phase. The Stefan condition determines the evolution of the surface Œì by giving an equation governing the velocity V of the free surface in the direction ŒΩ, specifically : LV = \\\\alpha_1\\\\partial_ u T_1 - \\\\alpha_2\\\\partial_ u T_2, where L is the latent heat of melting. By T1 we mean the limit of the gradient as x approaches Œìt from the region T > 0, and for T2 we mean the limit of the gradient as x approaches Œìt from the region T < 0\\\\. In this problem, we know beforehand the whole region Œ© but we only know the ice-liquid interface Œì at time t = 0. To solve the Stefan problem we not only have to solve the heat equation in each region, but we must also track the free boundary Œì. The one-phase Stefan problem corresponds to taking either Œ±1 or Œ±2 to be zero; it is a special case of the two-phase problem. In the direction of greater complexity we could also consider problems with an arbitrary number of phases.  Obstacle problems  Another famous free- boundary problem is the obstacle problem, which bears close connections to the classical Poisson equation. The solutions of the differential equation : - abla^2 u = f, \\\\qquad u_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} = g satisfy a variational principle, that is to say they minimize the functional : E[u] = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u^2 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x - \\\\int_\\\\Omega fu \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x over all functions u taking the value g on the boundary. In the obstacle problem, we impose an additional constraint: we minimize the functional E subject to the condition : u \\\\le \\\\varphi \\\\, in Œ©, for some given function œÜ. Define the coincidence set C as the region where u = œÜ. Furthermore, define the non-coincidence set N = Œ©\\\\C as the region where u is not equal to œÜ, and the free boundary Œì as the interface between the two. Then u satisfies the free boundary problem : - abla^2 u = f\\\\text{ in }N,\\\\quad u = g on the boundary of Œ©, and : u \\\\le \\\\varphi\\\\text{ in }\\\\Omega,\\\\quad abla u = abla\\\\varphi\\\\text{ on }\\\\Gamma. \\\\, Note that the set of all functions v such that v ‚â§ œÜ is convex. Where the Poisson problem corresponds to minimization of a quadratic functional over a linear subspace of functions, the free boundary problem corresponds to minimization over a convex set.  Connection with variational inequalities  Many free boundary problems can profitably be viewed as variational inequalities for the sake of analysis. To illustrate this point, we first turn to the minimization of a function F of n real variables over a convex set C; the minimizer x is characterized by the condition : abla F(x)\\\\cdot(y-x) \\\\ge 0\\\\text{ for all }y\\\\in C. \\\\, If x is in the interior of C, then the gradient of F must be zero; if x is on the boundary of C, the gradient of F at x must be perpendicular to the boundary. The same idea applies to the minimization of a differentiable functional F on a convex subset of a Hilbert space, where the gradient is now interpreted as a variational derivative. To concretize this idea, we apply it to the obstacle problem, which can be written as :\\\\int_\\\\Omega( abla^2 u + f)(v - u) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\ge 0\\\\text{ for all }v \\\\le \\\\varphi. This formulation permits the definition of a weak solution: using integration by parts on the last equation gives that :\\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u\\\\cdot abla(v-u)\\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\le \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(v-u) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\text{ for all } v \\\\le \\\\varphi. This definition only requires that u have one derivative, in much the same way as the weak formulation of elliptic boundary value problems.  Regularity of free boundaries  In the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, one demonstrates the existence of a weak solution of a differential equation with reasonable ease using some functional analysis arguments. However, the weak solution exhibited lies in a space of functions with fewer derivatives than one would desire; for example, for the Poisson problem, we can easily assert that there is a weak solution which is in H1, but it may not have second derivatives. One then applies some calculus estimates to demonstrate that the weak solution is in fact sufficiently regular. For free boundary problems, this task is more formidable for two reasons. For one, the solutions often exhibit discontinuous derivatives across the free boundary, while they may be analytic in any neighborhood away from it. Secondly, one must also demonstrate the regularity of the free boundary itself. For example, for the Stefan problem, the free boundary is a C1/2 surface. Related Problems From a purely academic point of view free boundaries belong to a larger class of problems usually referred to as overdetermined problems, or as David Kinderlehrer and Guido Stampacchia addressed it in their book: The problem of matching Cauchy data. Other related FBP that can be mentioned are Pompeiu problem, Schiffer‚Äôs conjectures. See the external links below.

Life  Nicholas II of Opava was a member of the Opava branch of the Bohemian noble P≈ôemyslovci family. His parents were Duke Nicholas I of Opava, who had held Opava since 1269, and Adelheid of Habsburg, a niece of King Rudolf I. He was a supporter of King John of Luxembourg of Bohemia, who gave him Opava as a fief in 1318 and at the same time raised it to an independent duchy. He moved the ducal residence from Hradec nad Moravic√≠ () to Opava (). Also in 1318, he married with Anna, the only sister of Duke Leszek of Ratib√≥r. Since Leszek left no offspring, the Duchy of Ratib√≥r reverted to the Bohemian Crown after Leszek death in 1336. King John gave it to his loyal vassal Nicholas II in 1337. With his dual power base in Opava and Ratib√≥r, Nicholas became one of the most powerful princes in the upper Oder area. With the acquisition by Nicholas, Ratib√≥r came under a foreign ruler and due to the personal union, Opava became more oriented towards Silesia. In 1337, the princes of Opole also claimed Ratib√≥r; King John sold them the Moravian town of Prudnik () instead. In a document dated 1350, Nicholas II is mentioned as Burgrave of K≈Çodzko. In 1355 he had to give up Ko≈∫le and Gliwice, which had been transferred to Duke Leszek.  Marriage and issue  Nicholas was married three times. Around 1318 he married Anna of Racib√≥rz (died around 1340), a daughter of Duke Przemys≈Çaw of Racib√≥rz. Several children resulted from this marriage: * John I (died: between 1380 and 1382), : married in 1361 Anna, a daughter of the Duke Henry V of G≈Çog√≥w-≈ªaga≈Ñ (died 1369). He established the Opava-Ratib√≥r line of the P≈ôemyslovci family. * Euphemia (died 1352) : married in 1335 Duke Siemowit III of Mazovia (died 1381) * Elisabeth (died 1386), a nun in Ratib√≥r * Agnes (died 1404), a nun in Ratib√≥r * Anna (died 1361) : married in 1346 Count Burchard of Hardegg and Retz, Burgrave of Magdeburg (died 1360 or 1361) * Margaret (died 1363) :married in 1349 the Margrave John Henry of Moravia (died 1375). After Anna's death, Nicholas married in May 1342 to Hedwig (died 1359), a daughter of Duke Konrad I of Ole≈õnica (died 1366). From this marriage, he had a son * Nicholas III (died 1394), Duke of G≈Çubczyce 1377‚Äì1394 In 1360, Nicholas married his third wife, Jutta (died after 1378), a daughter of the Duke Boleslaw II of Opole-Falkenberg.

Rebecca Rossignol Pomroy (born in Boston, Massachusetts, 16 July 1817; died in Newton, Massachusetts, 24 January 1884) was a nurse and philanthropist of the United States. During the Civil War, she worked in military hospitals, and also looked after the family of President Abraham Lincoln twice. Biography Pomroy was the daughter of Samuel and Dorcas Holliday. Her father was a captain of a merchant ship, and died when she was 10, and she, her mother and her three sisters lived on the income from sewing. On 12 September 1836, she married Daniel F. Pomroy, an upholsterer. Sickness in her own family for nearly twenty years made her an accomplished nurse. When her only surviving son enlisted in the [Union Army], she offered her services to [Dorothea Dix]. She was at once called to [Washington, D.C.], and in September 1861 assigned to duty in Georgetown Hospital, but was soon transferred to the hospital at [Columbian University]. Early in 1862 she was called to the [White House] at the time of the death of [Willie Lincoln], and nursed \\"[Tad Lincoln],\\" the youngest son, then very ill, and [Mary Todd Lincoln], until both were restored to health. President Lincoln said to her at that time, \\"Tell your grandchildren how indebted the nation was to you in holding up my hands in time of trouble.\\" Pomroy then returned to the hospital and continued in her work. In 1864, when the president's life was threatened and Mary Lincoln was suffering from injuries that she had received in a fall from her carriage, Pomroy again went to the White House. Later in the year, she spent some time at the West Hospital in Baltimore, but ultimately returned to the hospital at Columbian University. Refusing advantageous offers to go elsewhere, she remained at her post until the close of the war. Then she was stricken with [typhoid fever], and was an invalid for several years. She became matron in 1867 of a reformatory home for girls at [Newton Centre, Massachusetts], and then of the Newton Home for Orphans and Destitute Girls, which became the Rebecca Pomroy Home after her death.

In addition to his career as cinematographer, Gunnar Fischer directed short films, wrote screenplays (1933‚Äì41) and published books for children. Life and career Fischer (behind the camera), Maj-Britt Nilsson (lying down) and Ingmar Bergman (right) on the set of Secrets of Women, 1952. Gunnar Fischer was born in Ljungby, Sweden on November 18, 1910, the son of Greta Lokrantz and Gunnar Fischer. Fischer studied painting for Otte Sk√∂ld before electing to join the Swedish Navy for 3 years. His passion for film led him to the Svensk Filmindustri where he learned cinematography from Victor Sj√∂str√∂m's photographer Julius Jaenzon. Acting as an assistant cameraman for 16 feature films, he made his debut as director of photography in 1942. Known for his work with directors Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer (Two People, 1945), as well as work with Walt Disney, Fischer received an honorary Guldbagge Award for lifetime achievement in 2002, as well as the Ingmar Bergman Award in 1992. His first collaboration with Bergman was on the melodrama Port of Call (1948), a partnership which continued until The Devil's Eye (1960). Fischer has been quoted saying the two men were never each other's \\"bowing servants\\" yet his admiration for Bergman stood firm: \\"I felt privileged collaborating with Bergman.\\" \\"Fischer's great skill was in monochrome,\\" according to the British film historian Peter Cowie. \\"He gave Bergman's films that unique expressionist look, with their brilliant contrasts in every gradation of black and white.\\" His style was drawn from the landscapes of Carl Theodore Dreyer and Victor Sj√∂str√∂m, whom he knew well. The International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers describes Fischer's style as \\"in the mainstream of the Scandinavian tradition,\\" and celebrates the close and \\"intensely psychological close-ups and two-shots.\\" Widely recognized for his striking imagery and cold lighting, Fischer was the \\"first cinematographer to capture with unparalleled beauty the cruelty, sensuality and selfishness that often collided in the same scene among Bergman's anguished characters.\\" Almost as striking was the camerawork for Bergman‚Äôs historical feature The Seventh Seal, which depicted a medieval encounter between a knight back from the Crusades and the figure of Death. Told in stark black and white, its most famous scene featured them playing chess together on a bleak Nordic beach. Borrowing a trick from the stage, Fischer lit the shot so that both men were seen in sharp relief against the dark, brooding waves. Pedants insisted that this image was impossible as it implied the existence of two suns in different quarters of the sky; Fischer dismissed the criticism on the ground that if the very notion of a knight playing chess with Death were accepted, two suns in the sky should be no more incredible.

Around one in five Australian children attend Catholic schools. Catholic education in Australia refers to the education services provided by the Roman Catholic Church in Australia within the Australian education system. From 18th century foundations, the Catholic education system has grown to be the second biggest provider of school-based education in Australia, after government schools. The Catholic Church has established primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions in Australia. , one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools. There are over 1,700 Catholic schools in Australia with more than 750,000 students enrolled, employing almost 60,000 teachers. Administrative oversight of Catholic education providers varies depending on the origins, ethos, and purpose of each education provider. Oversight of Catholic systemic schools may rest with a Catholic parish, diocese, or archdiocese; while religious institutes have oversight of Catholic independent schools; and Catholic universities are administered through an academic senate. Schools Mary Mackillop established an extensive network of schools for the poor and is Australia's first canonised saint of the Catholic Church GPS athletes from St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, pictured in 1939. The observatory at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview was founded by the distinguished Jesuit scientist Edward Francis Pigot in 1908 (L-R) The Memorial Chapel on top of the hill overlooking a game of Australian rules football being played on the Roche Oval, Xavier College, Melbourne =History= The first permanent Catholics in Australia came on the First Fleet to Sydney in 1788. One-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic and at least half of them were born in Ireland. A small proportion of British marines were also Catholic. Just as the British were setting up the new colony, French captain Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse arrived off Botany Bay with two ships.See extract from La Perouse's journal published in 1799 as; \\"A Voyage Around the world\\", pp. 179‚Äì180 in Frank Crowley (1980), Colonial Australia. A Documentary History of Australia 1, 1788‚Äì1840. 3‚Äì4, Thomas Nelson, Melbourne. La P√©rouse was six weeks in Port Jackson, where the French, besides other things, held Catholic Masses. Some of the Irish convicts had been transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority church for the first three decades of settlement. Catholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Anglicans. The first Catholic priest colonists arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 ‚Äì convicted for \\"complicity\\" in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. The Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and the priests permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Priests were not officially permitted to travel to the colony until 1820. At first, the Church of England was the established christian church in the colony, and during the early years of transportation all convicts were required to attend Anglican services on Sundays. This included Irish Catholics as well as Jews. Similarly, education in the new settlement was Anglican-controlled until the 1840s. Free \\"charity schools\\" run by other denominations gradually came into existence later. The absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire, but by 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies. The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales following the Church Act of 1836. Drafted by the Catholic attorney-general John Plunkett, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists. John Bede Polding, a Benedictine monk, was Sydney's first bishop (and then archbishop) from 1835 to 1877. Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838. While tensions arose between the English Benedictine hierarchy and the Irish Ignatian-tradition order from the start, the sisters set about pastoral care in a women's prison and began visiting hospitals and schools and establishing employment for convict women. In 1847, two sisters transferred to Hobart and established a school. The sisters went on to establish hospitals in four of the eastern states. At Polding's request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools but the Irish-English divide proved problematic and the brothers returned to Ireland. In 1857, Polding founded an Australian order of nuns in the Benedictine tradition ‚Äì the Sisters of the Good Samaritan ‚Äì to work in education and social work. Establishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in the newly established colony of South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory ‚Äì Austrian Jesuits established themselves in the south and north and Irish in the east. The Australian gold rushes saw a rapid increase in the population and prosperity of the colonies. While the Austrian priests traversed the Outback on horseback to found missions and schools, the Irish priests arrived in the east in 1860 and had by 1880 established the major schools of Xavier College in Melbourne, St Aloysius' College and Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney ‚Äì which each survive to the present. In 1872, Victoria became the first Australian colony to pass an education act providing for free, secular public education. The other colonies followed over the following two decades. With the subsequent withdrawal of state aid for church schools around 1880, the Catholic Church, unlike other Australian churches, put great energy and resources into creating a comprehensive alternative system of education. It was largely staffed by nuns, brothers and priests of religious orders, such as the Christian Brothers (who had returned to Australia in 1868); the Sisters of Mercy (who had arrived in Perth in 1846); Marist Brothers, who came from France in 1872 and the Sisters of St Joseph, founded in Australia by Mary MacKillop and Fr Julian Tenison Woods in 1867. MacKillop travelled throughout Australasia and established schools, convents and charitable institutions but came into conflict with those bishops who preferred diocesan control of the order rather than central control from Adelaide by the Josephite order. MacKillop administered the Josephites as a national order at a time when Australia was divided among individually governed colonies. She is today the most revered of Australian Catholics, canonised by Benedict XVI in 2010. Catholic schools flourished in Australia and by 1900 there were 115 Christian Brothers teaching in Australia. By 1910 there were 5000 sisters from all orders teaching in schools. Following the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, the church experienced huge changes but also began to suffer a decline in vocations to the religious life, leading to a priest shortage. On the other hand, Catholic education under lay leadership has expanded, and about 20% of Australian school students attend a Catholic school. In 1962, Goulburn was the focus of the fight for state aid to non-government schools. An education strike was called in response to a demand for installation of three extra toilets at a local Catholic primary school, St Brigid's. The local Catholic archdiocese closed down all local Catholic primary schools and sent the children to the government schools. The Catholic authorities declared that they had no money to install the extra toilets. Nearly 1,000 children turned up to be enrolled locally and the state schools were unable to accommodate them. The strike lasted only a week but generated national debate. In 1963 the prime minister, Robert Menzies, made state aid for science blocks part of his party's platform. Since the late 1960s, generous funding from state and federal governments has sustained the Catholic education system. Australia's post-World War II multicultural immigration program has seen a diversification of the Catholic population of Australia away from its predominantly Irish roots ‚Äì with Catholics arriving from nations like Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Vietnam and Sudan and changing the face of the student population undergoing Catholic education. Allegations of sexual abuse by staff associated with Catholic education in Australia have involved small fractions of students and staff at Catholic schools and received widespread media and community scrutiny. In 1996, the Australian Church issued a document, Towards Healing, which it described as seeking to \\"establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse\\". Papal apologies followed from John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Outside the church, Broken Rites, a not-for-profit organisation, was formed in 1983 with the aim of researching the cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. , one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools. As with other classes of non-government schools in Australia, Catholic schools receive funding from the Commonwealth government. Church schools range from elite, high cost schools (which generally offer extensive bursary programs for low-income students) to low-fee local schools. Notable schools include the Jesuit colleges of Loyola College Watsonia, St Aloysius, Loyola Senior High School, Mount Druitt and Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview in Sydney, Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide and Xavier College in Melbourne; the Marist Brothers St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, and the Marist Brothers St Gregory's College, Campbelltown; the Society of the Sacred Heart's Rosebay Kincoppal School, the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Loreto Normanhurst and Loreto Kirribilli, the Sisters of Mercy's Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College, the Christian Brothers' St Edmund's College, Canberra, Waverley College Sydney, St Kevin's College, Melbourne, St Mary Mackillop College, Canberra and Aquinas College, Perth ‚Äì however, the list and range of Catholic primary and secondary schools in Australia is long and diverse and extends throughout metropolitan, regional and remote Australia: see Catholic schools in Australia. =Administration and funding= Aquinas College, Perth Chapel In Australia, the state and territory governments have the primary responsibility for funding state government schools and also provide supplementary assistance to non-government schools. However, the Australian federal government is the primary source of public funding for non-government schools (while also providing supplementary assistance to government schools). These public funds subsidise the fees paid by parents for the education of their children at Catholic schools. These provide the overall effect of reducing the numbers and therefore burden on public funding for government schools. Most non-government schools have some religious affiliation, with approximately two-thirds of their students enrolled in Catholic schools. In the final year of secondary schooling, students at both government and non- government schools sit for a government-endorsed certificate that is recognised by all Australian universities and vocational education and training institutions. Thus, Catholic schools may freely teach and encourage religious studies, values and community engagement; and must adhere to the broader requirements of Australia's secular education system. The National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC), established by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference through the Bishops Commission for Catholic Education, is tasked with maintaining liaison with the federal government and other key national education bodies and complements and supports the work of the state and territory Catholic education commissions. While some Catholic schools operate independently via religious institutes, the majority of Catholic schools, called systemic schools, operate under the Canon Law jurisdiction of an ecclesiastical public juridic person, such as a bishop. In practice, the bishop assigns a Catholic Education Office (CEO), Catholic Education Commission, Catholic Schools Offices, or a similar body with daily operational responsibility for the leadership, efficient operation, and management of the Catholic systemic schools which educate in parish primary and regional secondary schools in Australia. These diocesan bodies are charged with the implementation and management of the policies of the diocese and the allocation and administration of the funds provided by government and private sources to Catholic systemic schools, as well as the financial responsibilities for administration of salaries for staff members. Many Catholic schools in Australia are connected to the Internet via Catholic Education Network (CEnet). =Ethos= While Catholic schools must adhere to the broad requirements of Australia's secular education system, they are free to provide a \\"Catholic\\" education ethos. The Catholic Education Office of Melbourne outlines this \\"ethos\\" as follows: Catholic view of marriage With curriculum changes flowing from possible outcomes of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, the NCEC said, without seeing what was proposed, \\"it is impossible to ... ensure Catholic schools can continue to teach the Catholic view of marriage\\". =Alumni= Among the millions of Australians who have attended Catholic schools, many have been prominent in public life. In recent years these have included prime ministers Paul Keating, Kevin Rudd, and Tony Abbott, former governor-general Sir William Deane, former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer, the first woman elected to lead an Australian state or territory, Rosemary Follett and serving Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore. Current parliamentarians include Bill Shorten and Barnaby Joyce. Prominent indigenous Australians include former senator Aden Ridgeway, Pat Dodson (the first Aboriginal person to become a Catholic priest in Australia), and his brother, Mick, and Kurtley Beale. In the arts a large number of Catholic educated people have been prominent, from the father of Australian rock and roll, Johnny O'Keefe, to contemporary musicians such as Paul Kelly and Ignatius Jones. In film and television, Catholic educated Australians have included Mel Gibson, David Wenham, Julian Morrow, Antonia Kidman, Anh Do, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner. Contemporary Australian writers who have attended Catholic schools include Robert Hughes, Morris West, Nick Enright, Justin Fleming and Gerard Windsor. Princess Michael of Kent, businesswomen Ita Buttrose, Gai Waterhouse and Lucy Turnbull all attended the Society of the Sacred Heart's Kincoppal School. A former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Murray Gleeson, attended St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill and his successor, Robert French, attended St. Louis School, Claremont, Western Australia. As of August 2011, a nine members of the 49 member New South Wales Supreme Court were former students of the Jesuit's St Ignatius' College Riverview. Former treasurer and now Ambassador of Australia to the United States, Joe Hockey received a Catholic education. Universities Australian Catholic University Signadou Campus in the Canberra suburb of Watson. The Australian Catholic University opened in 1991, following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia. These institutions had their origins in the 1800s, when religious orders and institutes became involved in preparing teachers for Catholic schools and nurses for Catholic hospitals. The University of Notre Dame Australia opened in Western Australia in December 1989 and now has over 9,000 students on three campuses in Fremantle, Sydney and Broome. Campion College, established in 2005, is a liberal arts college located in the suburbs of Sydney.

She was sunk by air attack during the evacuation of Dunkirk in May 1940.Fenella under construction.Fenella is launched at Barrow; 16 December 1936. Fenellas sister ship Tynwald was also lost during the war. Dimensions Identical to her twin sister Tynwald, Fenella had a registered tonnage of 2376; a beam of 46'; length 314'6\\" and a depth of 18'. Both Tynwald and Fenella were designed with a service speed of 21 knots, accommodation for a crew of 68, and certificated to carry 1968 passengers. Both vessels were fitted with twin-screw geared turbines, and had water tube boilers with a steam pressure of , and two sets of single-reduction turbines, developing . Both Fenella and Tynwald were launched at Barrow on the same day, 16 December 1936. Service life Smaller than their immediate predecessors, they were designed specifically for winter work and were the first ships in the company to have cruiser sterns. Both ships worked on the heavy seasonal traffic on the main Douglas-Liverpool route, and both were much appreciated by passengers, especially in winter weather. With large public rooms, both twins were furnished to a high standard, and apart from slight decorative differences, they were of similar external appearance, except that Tynwald had her upper strake painted white, whereas on Fenella it was black. On Tuesday 16 November 1937, a storm, with associated south-easterly gales, forced Fenella to seek shelter on the protected western side of the Isle of Man near Peel.Peel City Guardian. Saturday 20 Nov 1937; Section:Front page; Page Number:1 She proceeded to Douglas early on the morning of Wednesday 17 November, to take the morning sailing to Liverpool. However, whilst berthing in challenging conditions, a mooring rope fouled one of her propellers. Fenella was taken to the inner harbour at Douglas, where divers tried and failed to free the rope. Due to the ebbing tide in the inner harbour, Fenella then went aground, and the sailing was cancelled. That same day, her sister Tynwald also had problems trying to berth in Douglas, which before the construction of the Princess Alexandra Pier in 1984, was particularly hazardous during strong easterly winds. Taking that morning's sailing from Liverpool to Douglas, Tynwald had great difficulty berthing at the King Edward VIII Pier, and suffered damage to the belting on her starboard side, over a distance of about five metres, as well as suffering damage to her plating.Peel City Guardian; Date:20 Nov 1937; Section:Front page; Page Number:1 Finally she secured alongside, and having discharged her passengers and mail, Tynwald then departed for Liverpool at 15:50, taking the passengers and mail which should have left on Fenellas morning sailing. Fenella then had the rope removed from her propeller, and resumed normal service the following day. Fenella approaches Douglas. On Tuesday 17 January 1939, whilst lying at anchor in the River Mersey, having taken the sailing from Douglas to Liverpool, Fenella was run into by a cargo ship, the SS Eastleigh, which had arrived from Karachi, and was proceeding to berth at Bromborough Dock.Peel City Guardian; Date:21 Jan 1939 Part of the Fenella's belting was carried away, and damage was sustained to one of her lifeboats, along with damage to her plating. The Fenella was taken to the Prince's Landing Stage, where she was inspected by representatives of the Board of Trade. Temporary repairs were carried out, and Fenella was able to sail from Liverpool to Douglas the following day. At this time Tynwald was undergoing an overhaul, and had been replaced by the Mona's Isle which was working in conjunction with the Fenella.'' Tynwald was due to resume service, replacing Mona's Isle, on Thursday, 19 January, but this was delayed until 21 January. Fenella then underwent repairs to the damage she had sustained in the collision with the Eastleigh, and Tynwald joined Mona's Isle, which had to be kept in service substituting for the Fenella. War service and loss Requisitioned in the first week of the war as a personnel carrier, Fenellas first few months were relatively uneventful. Then, on 28 May 1940, Fenella joined no less than seven of her steam packet sisters and made passage to Dunkirk. On 29 May 1940, under the command of her Master, Captain W. Cubbon, Fenella made her first trip into the evacuation area. She started to embark troops from the East Pier, and had 650 on board when she came under heavy fire in the third massed air attack of that day. She was hit by three bombs in quick succession, the first bomb hitting her directly on the promenade deck, the second bomb hitting the pier, blowing lumps of concrete through the ship's side below the waterline, and the third exploded between the pier and the ship's side, wrecking the engine room. Fenella comes under air attack, whilst berthed alongside the East Mole at Dunkirk, 29 May 1940. The Fenella was abandoned and later sank. The troops were disembarked onto the pier, where they were picked up by the famous old London pleasure steamer, the Crested Eagle. This too, was subsequently bombed and beached. The survivors of the Fenellas crew were later picked up by the Dutch skoot, the Patria, which was under Royal Navy command. Others of the crew had succeeded in getting ashore via the pier and had been taken on to the Crested Eagle, only to receive a direct hit. The Fenella had gone into the harbour with a crew of 48, all Steam Packet men and most of them Manxmen. Four men had been left behind on leave. In all, 33 men got back to Dover, where one died of wounds. Many had been wounded, some seriously. Some weeks later, a postcard was received from junior steward Thomas Helsby, who was 19 years of age, and came from Liverpool. He had last been seen, terribly burned, as the Fenella was foundering after the bomb attack. It transpired that he had been taken prisoner of war ‚Äì the only Steam Packet Company man to be taken prisoner in all the operations of its ships in wartime ‚Äì and was in a hospital in occupied Belgium. The German surgeons did an expert job on him, and he was repatriated before the end of the war, and eventually rejoined the Steam Packet. Kallow Point, Port St Mary, commemorating the loss of Mona's Queen, , and . Operation Dynamo, whilst widely regarded as the Steam Packet's \\"finest hour\\", also saw its blackest day. Three vessels were lost from the fleet on 29 May: Mona's Queen, King Orry and Fenella. Ultimate fate The sinking of the Fenella was later followed by a theory that the ship had been raised by the enemy, fitted with new engines, and used under the name Reval. Much later, the belief grew that she had been taken over by the Russians, following the collapse of Germany. F B O'Friel has arrived at what is probably the authentic version after help from a correspondent who searched the Kriegsmarine files at Freiburg. From the papers unearthed, it seems certain that the wrecked Fenella was eventually removed piecemeal from the harbour as scrap. The Germans had classified her as Wreck No. 11. Near her, had been Wreck No. 8, the steamer Bawtry. This ship was raised in March 1941, and was later repaired at Antwerp and declared a 'prize of war'. She was taken over by a Kiel shipping firm in 1943 under the name of Rival, only to be completely destroyed in the massive RAF air raid on Hamburg on the night of 31 December 1944.

He is best remembered, however, for his role in leading opposition to Mormon settlers in northwestern Missouri, and for the active role he took in operations against them in the fall of 1838. These operations led to the expulsion of nearly all Mormons from the state following the issuance of Governor Lilburn Boggs' infamous Extermination Order in October of that year. Early years and family Samuel Bogart was born in Carter County, Tennessee, the son of Cornelius Bogart (1761‚Äì1809) and Elizabeth Moffett. Orphaned at the age of fifteen, Bogart enlisted in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, serving in Capt. Wm. McLeland's company, 7th Infantry. He fought at the Battle of New Orleans, then later in the Black Hawk War in Illinois, where he served as a Major in the Illinois state militia.Major Samuel A. Bogart Bogart was married to Rachel Hammer on 19 May 1818, in Washington County, Tennessee, and had two sons and three daughters:Major Samuel A. Bogart *1) Eliza Ann, born 15 November 1821 in Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois; died 17 April 1917 in Caddo County, Oklahoma. *2) Cornelius H. Bogart, born 10 March 1823, Morgan County, Illinois; died 3 December 1846 in Illinois. *3) William Bogart, born 1826, Schuyler County, Illinois; died August 1828 in Schuyler County, Illinois. *4) Jane Elizabeth Bogart, born 17 July 1832, McComb, Schuyler County, Illinois; died 14 April 1918 in Decatur, Wise County, Texas. She married Leroy Clement on 25 July 1846, in Fannin County, Texas. Son Lee Clement married Julia Clement August 24, 1883 in Whitesboro, Texas and had seven children. *5) Margaret Ellen Bogart, born 29 Jan 1835, Ray County, Missouri; died 7 May 1906 in Weatherford, Parker County, Texas. Opposition to the Mormons Bogart relocated from Illinois to Missouri in 1833, where he settled in rural Ray County in the northwestern part of the state. Here, he served as a farmer and itinerant Methodist minister, as well as the captain of his local militia unit. Peter Burnett, a lawyer from Ray County who would later become the first Governor of California, wrote that Bogart was \\"not a very discreet man, and his men were pretty much of the same character\\".Peter H. Burnett, An Old California Pioneer, by Peter H. Burnett, First Governor of the State (Oakland: Biobooks, 1946), p. 34. During the fall of 1838, Bogart became involved in an ongoing dispute between members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as \\"Mormons,\\" and their non-Mormon neighbors in Daviess County. Having been forcibly expelled from Jackson County in 1833, the Mormons had migrated north to a county specially created for them by the legislature, Caldwell. However, the influx of new Mormon converts into Missouri caused them to start settling in adjacent counties (including Daviess), which many older settlers felt they had no right to do.Alexander W. Doniphan, quote. Fears arose that the Mormons would take control of all political offices in nearby counties, and this combined with prejudice and fears about the Mormons' economic practices, attitudes toward Native Americans and slaves, and other factors to create an explosive situation by the fall of 1838.The definitive work on the 1838 Mormon War is Stephen C. LeSueur, The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri (University of Missouri Press: 1987). Pertinent information on the origin of the conflict between the Mormons and their Missouri neighbors may be found on pp. 15‚Äì27. See also James H. Jenkins, Casus Belli (Blue & Grey Press: 1999), for a brief overview of factors that led to the outbreak of hostilities between the Mormons and the Missourians. Bogart first took an active role in anti-Mormon activities during a disturbance in Carroll County, where Mormons had established a settlement called De Witt, in violation of an alleged agreement with non-Mormons not to settle in that county. No written agreement to this effect was ever produced, but this did not stop renegade Missouri militiamen from laying siege to the Mormon settlement from October 1 to October 10, 1838. When General Hiram Parks arrived with militia troops‚ÄîBogart and his company among them‚Äîto restore order, Bogart and his unit immediately sided with the anti-Mormon mob, refusing to obey General Parks' orders to such a point that Parks had to order them back to Ray County to prevent them from joining the vigilantes.LeSueur, pp. 101‚Äì07. See also Alexander Baugh, Letter of Samuel Bogart to the Quincy Postmaster, pg. 52. Parks unsuccessfully endeavored to have Bogart expelled from the State Guard for his insubordination.LeSueur, pg. 132. Following a fight between Mormons and non-Mormons during a county election in Gallatin, county seat of Daviess County, Bogart impetuously called out his militia unit, ostensibly to prevent an imminent invasion of Ray County by the Latter Day Saints. No such invasion was actually contemplated, but Bogart decided to act aggressively against the Mormons, anyway.LeSueur, pp. 132‚Äì33. He marched his company to the Caldwell County line, picking up volunteers along the way, then obtained permission from his new superior, General David Atchison, to \\"range the line\\" between the two counties to prevent any invasion of Ray County.LeSueur, pg. 133. However, Bogart and his men decided that the defensive posture ordered by Atchison was not to their liking, and so they divided into smaller units and proceeded to disarm Mormons living first in northern Ray County, then in southern Caldwell, as well. Though clearly exceeding his original mandate, Bogart continued to harass and threaten local Mormon settlers and even threatened to give Far West‚Äîcounty seat of Caldwell County, and the main Mormon settlement in Missouri‚Äî\\"thunder and lightning\\" if the Mormons did not leave the area forthwith.LeSueur, pg. 133. However, Mormon assertions that Bogart plundered Mormon farms and houses have not been substantiated by contemporary witnesses, according to Stephen LeSueur, a modern historian of this conflict.LeSueur, pp. 133. Nevertheless, lurid reports of alleged depredations by Bogart, who was already known for his vehemently anti-Mormon stance, were readily believed by Mormon leaders and historians. Battle of Crooked River Map illustrating the Battle of Crooked River. On the afternoon of 24 October 1838, some of Bogart's men, operating independently of Bogart's main command, took two Mormon spies prisoner at a home where the Mormon \\"spy company\\" (a group of Mormons who had been assembled to scout the movements of Bogart and other anti-Mormon vigilantes in the areaLeSueur, pg. 131.) was quartered. The two prisoners, after being threatened with death, were taken together with a third prisoner to Bogart's camp on the Crooked River, in northern Ray County, where they were interrogated and further threatened by Bogart's men. Other Mormons living in the house were warned that they would be killed if they had not vacated the county by morning, and they took news of the spies' capture to Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders in Far West. Although Bogart apparently intended only to hold his prisoners overnight and then release them the next day,LeSueur, pg. 134, supported by affidavit of Addison Green, one of the two Mormon prisoners. the Mormons in Far West believed that he intended to execute them, and accordingly resolved upon a rescue operation. Led by Mormon apostle David W. Patten, a unit of Mormon militia from Caldwell County crossed into Ray County early in the morning of 25 October, and attacked Bogart's sleeping men at approximately 3 am in their camp alongside the river. A savage fight ensued, resulting in the deaths of three Mormons (including Apostle Patten) and seven wounded, to one dead and six wounded for Bogart's company.LeSueur, pp. 137‚Äì43. The Mormons rescued their hostages and drove Bogart from the field; however, when exaggerated accounts of the battle reached Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs (a notorious anti-Mormon), the governor responded by issuing his infamous \\"Extermination Order,\\" which directed that the Mormons be \\"exterminated, or driven from the state\\"; the State Guard was directed to carry out this order.LeSueur, pp. 150‚Äì53. Following the Crooked River battle, Bogart (who had survived unscathed) took part in the Missouri militia siege of Far West, which resulted in the final surrender of the Latter Day Saints and their agreement to leave Missouri completely. During the subsequent preliminary hearing before Judge Austin King of Ray County, Bogart and his men were detailed to guard Joseph Smith and other high-ranking Mormon prisoners, as well as those witnesses assembled to testify in their behalf. Bogart and his men intimidated the Mormon leaders and witnesses, even threatening to shoot them on more than one occasion.LeSueur, pg. 198. Following the conclusion of the hearing and the confinement of the Mormon leaders at the jail in Liberty, Missouri, Bogart commenced a search for any Mormons who had participated in the attack on him at Crooked River, intending to shoot any that he might find; he was unsuccessful in this effort, however.LeSueur, pp. 231‚Äì32. Later, after the Mormons and their leaders (who had been permitted to escape from custody) had relocated to Nauvoo, Illinois, Bogart wrote a letter to the postmaster at nearby Quincy, Illinois; he described the Crooked River battle, and named nine alleged participants whom he asked the postmaster's help in locating and apprehending, together with property he claimed the Mormons had stolen from him.Alexander Baugh, Letter of Samuel Bogart to the Quincy Postmaster, pg. 54. No record exists as to whether Bogart ever recovered any of his alleged belongings. Move to Texas and later years Following the conclusion of the Mormon War, Bogart was involved in an altercation with fellow-citizen Alexander Beattie during a militia election, during which Bogart shot and killed Beattie, then fled to Texas with a thousand-dollar bounty on his head.Major Samuel A. Bogart, quoted from American Masonic Register and Literary Companion, vol. 1, pg. 199. He settled in Washington County, where he joined the Texas Rangers and became a company commander in that organization.Major Samuel A. Bogart While in the Rangers, Bogart participated in the abortive Mier Expedition in 1842‚Äì43 into Mexico, which resulted in the infamous \\"black bean\\" incident, where seventeen Texans were executed after drawing black beans in a random death lottery instituted by orders of Mexican President Santa Anna. Bogart survived his experiences in Mexico, and upon his return to Texas in 1844, settled down in Collin County. Here he would serve four two-year terms in the state legislature, including one as a senator.Major Samuel A. Bogart Bogart was never brought to justice for his murder of Beattie, nor for any of the depredations he had committed against the Mormons in Missouri. Bogart resigned from the Texas legislature in 1861 on account of ill health, after signing the Texas ordinance of secession. He died on 11 March 1861, and is buried in Collin County in an unmarked grave.Major Samuel A.

The HFCS industry has tried to respond to these campaigns with their own efforts. Labeling as \\"natural\\" In May 2006, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) threatened to file a lawsuit against Cadbury Schweppes for labeling 7 Up as \\"All Natural\\" or \\"100% Natural\\", despite the presence of high-fructose corn syrup. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no general definition of \\"natural\\"; however, FDA regulations define \\"natural flavoring\\" to include products of vegetables. Current FDA policy is that it does not object to labeling HFCS as \\"natural.\\"Letter to Corn Refiners Association, July 3, 2008 The CSPI also state that HFCS is not a \\"natural\\" ingredient due to the high level of processing and the use of at least one genetically modified (GMO) enzyme required to produce it. On January 12, 2007, Cadbury Schweppes agreed to stop calling 7 Up \\"all natural\\". They now label it \\"100% Natural Flavors\\". HFCS advertisements In September 2008, the Corn Refiners Association launched a series of United States television advertisements that stated that HFCS \\"is made from corn\\", \\"is natural\\" (changed from previously stated \\"doesn't have artificial ingredients\\"), \\"has the same calories as sugar or honey\\", \\"is nutritionally the same as sugar\\", and \\"is fine in moderation\\", in the hopes of keeping consumers from avoiding HFCS products. The ads feature actors portraying roles in upbeat domestic situations with sugary foods, with one actor disparaging a food's HFCS content but being unable to explain why, and another actor questioning the comments with these claims. Finally, the ads each make reference to the Corn Refiners Association website.http://www.sweetsurprise.com/, YouTube, YouTube 2010 Corn Refiners Association ads feature parents walking through a corn field, talking about children's nutrition concerns and being confused by recent HFCS information. So they consulted \\"medical and nutrition experts\\" and discovered that \\"Whether it's corn sugar or cane sugar, your body can't tell the difference.\\" Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the advertisements \\"deceptive\\", stating: \\"High-fructose corn syrup starts out as cornstarch, which is chemically or enzymatically degraded to glucose and some short polymers of glucose. Another enzyme is then used to convert varying fractions of glucose into fructose...High-fructose corn syrup just doesn't exist in nature.\\" However, Jacobson also stated out: \\"The special harmfulness of high-fructose corn syrup has become one of those urban myths that sounds right, but is basically wrong. Nutritionally, high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose may be identical.\\" Since HFCS is present in a \\"staggering\\" amount of food in the US, and in most foods marketed to children, there are doubts as to whether it can be consumed in moderation: Moves back to sugar A March 21, 2009 The New York Times article said that some food companies and restaurants were using sugar in their product as a selling point in order to attract customers who prefer not to consume high-fructose corn syrup. As one example, the article cited Jason's Deli, a chain of delis with 200 restaurants in 27 states. The chain had replaced high-fructose corn syrup with sugar in everything except a few soft drinks. Daniel Helfman, a spokesman for the deli chain, was quoted as saying, \\"Part of this is a huge rebellion against HFCS... but part of it is taste.\\" PepsiCo recently put forth a \\"throwback\\" version of Mountain Dew and Pepsi-Cola, designed to taste the same as these drinks did in the 1960s and 1970s. One aspect of the formulation is that sugar is used instead of HFCS. PepsiCo stated that HFCS and sugar are \\"essentially the same\\" and that the only reason HFCS was eschewed was in order to accurately reflect the taste of the past.February 26, 2009 Official Facts about Pepsi Throwback & Mountain Dew Throwback Bevreview.com Dr Pepper also released a \\"heritage\\" version of Dr Pepper Soda in 2009 that was made to the original formula and used beet sugar instead of HFCS. Since its establishment in 1891, the Dr Pepper bottling plant in Dublin, TX has continued to use the original formula sweetened with Imperial Cane Sugar (see Dublin Dr Pepper).Dublin Dr Pepper History dublindrpepper.com In addition, the Coca-Cola bottling plant in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, and most Coca-Cola bottling plants in Europe also uses sucrose. Sucrose-based Mexican imports of Coca-Cola and other soft drinks are getting increasing penetration into US markets. In May 2010, Hunt's removed high-fructose corn syrup from its ketchup due to buyer preference as a result of health concerns, but has since put High Fructose Corn Syrup back in their ketchup. Heinz now offers a ketchup made with sugar instead of HFCS called \\"Simply Heinz.\\" Popular campaigns by nutritional experts and belief by a rapidly increasing faction of the consuming public in the United States that high-fructose corn syrup has harmful health effects continues to result in increasing reformulation of popular processed foods and reduced sales of HFCS by 9% in 2009 as compared with 2007. Known health risks include weight gain/obesity, type-2 diabetes, elevated LDL (\\"bad\\") cholesterol levels, long- term liver damage and mercury exposure. Ivan Royster of South Carolina, now residing in Raleigh, North Carolina began a Facebook page which has grown to over 190,000 fans, lobbying for the ban of HFCS in the U.S. An article recently published by Organic Connections magazine covered Ivan's protest and the Corn Refiners Association's counter to his efforts. The article includes links to Ivan's Facebook page and a study on HFCS. Proposed name change to corn sugar On September 14, 2010, the Corn Refiners Association applied for permission to use the name \\"corn sugar\\" in place of \\"high-fructose corn syrup\\" on food labels for products sold in the United States. According to a press release, \\"Consumers need to know what is in their foods and where their foods come from and we want to be clear with them,\\" said CRA president Audrae Erickson. \\"The term 'corn sugar' succinctly and accurately describes what this natural ingredient is and where it comes from ‚Äì corn.\\" The association, however, did not provide clarification as to a change in what the FDA already considers corn sugar, i.e., dextrose or any of the other corn-derived sugars such as corn syrup and maltodextrin. TIME stated that the CRA's decision to change the name of HFCS was because HFCS had such a bad reputation. In response to the proposed name change, The New York Times ran an article asking nutrition experts what they would suggest as appropriate names for HFCS. Three of the five experts recommended alternate names, including Michael Pollan who suggested \\"enzymatically altered corn glucose\\". Dr. Andrew Weil recommended not changing from HFCS, calling the term corn sugar \\"too vague\\" and the CRA's attempt to change HFCS's name \\"Orwellian\\". However Dr. Barry Popkin felt that \\"corn sugar\\" was an appropriate term. On May 31, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration ultimately rejected the petition. In its decision, the FDA defined sugar as a \\"solid, dried and crystallized food\\" while syrup was \\"an aqueous solution or liquid food.\\" In addition, the term \\"corn sugar\\" had already been approved as another name for dextrose, which has been commonly used as a food ingredient since the 1970s. Among the public health concerns cited were those individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance or fructose malabsorption, who have been advised to avoid ingredients that contain fructose. While individuals with fructose allergies have associated \\"corn sugar\\" (dextrose) to be an acceptable ingredient to their health when \\"high fructose corn syrup\\" is not, changing the name of HFCS to \\"corn sugar\\" could put these individuals at risk.

It is a small wooden commercial building erected in the 1880s. In 1987, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of only two remaining wood frame commercial buildings from the early years of Aspen's development as a silver mining boomtown. It was not originally a bakery, but became known for one that was operated in the building for almost 20 years. Today it is home to a boutique that sells artwork and hand-woven rugs. Building Riede's is located on the south side of East Hyman, near its junction with South Mill Street and the Wheeler Opera House, also listed on the Register. That block of East Hyman has been converted into a pedestrian mall, with commercial buildings on either side of the street in attached rows and tall trees and an unnamed tributary of the Roaring Fork in the middle of cobblestone pavement. The terrain is level, with Wagner Park to the west and the slopes of Aspen Mountain and its ski area several blocks to the south. To the south is one of the alleys connecting Aspen's streets. The building itself is a two-story wood frame structure with a false front on the northern (front) elevation. A glass storefront with recessed double-door entry is located at street level. Above it is a small wooden bracketed cornice setting off an area with clapboard siding topped by another, similar cornice at the roofline. Inside the building is mostly given over to retail space with high ceilings. The second story is not used for commercial purposes. It has of space. History The building was constructed in 1885; its original use is not known although it may have been a bakery. At that time Aspen, which had not even existed a decade earlier, was growing rapidly due to the Colorado Silver Boom. New buildings were erected regularly. Many were wooden. In the late 1880s, after the city experienced a few devastating fires, including the destruction of the large Clarendon Hotel, an ordinance was passed mandating that all new commercial construction be of brick or stone. In 1890 Raymond Riede bought the building and opened his bakery and confectionery there. Three years later the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act during the Panic of 1893 drastically reduced the demand for silver since the federal government was no longer a buyer. Aspen's population began declining as it entered a period since known as \\"the quiet years\\". Riede continued to operate his business until 1908. As the city's population continued to decline, many of its buildings from the boom years became vacant and neglected. They fell victim to fire or the effects of the severe winters at nearly of elevation in the mountains. The bakery building, still referred to by the name of its onetime owner, remained. It was a second- hand shop during the Great Depression. New owners from Denver bought the building in 1946, and renovated it. During the installation of water and sewer lines, they found remnants of the original outdoor brick ovens. When the work was complete, the building reopened as Louie's Spirit House, Aspen's first licensed liquor store. Louie's remained in business until 1973, after which it became Uncle Willy's Spirit House and then a women's clothing store. In 1985 its exterior was restored to its original appearance by a local architect. Today it houses Noori's Collection, a boutique selling handmade Persian carpets and Native American and Asian art. It has been valued at $3.3 million due to its location in downtown Aspen.

Although the inscription does not contain chandrasangkala (chronogram), the inscription was thought to be originated from the second half of the 14th century, based on the name of the king mentioned in this inscription. The inscription was compared to other historical sources, such as Carita Parahyangan and Pustaka Rajya Rajya i Bhumi Nusantara manuscripts, and it was concluded that the Kawali I inscription was meant as a sakakala or commemoration monument to honor the greatness of King Niskala Wastu Kancana, ruler of Sunda ruled from his capital in Kawali.

Since the late 18th century, the Anglican Church has been an important provider of education services within Australia. There are around 145 Anglican schools in Australia, providing for more than 105,000 children. History Richard Johnson, chaplain to the First Fleet, was charged with the organisation of schooling. The King's School, Parramatta, c.1890. Melbourne Grammar School students and building, c.1914 Prince Charles in 2005 with students from his Australian alma mater, Geelong Grammar. The permanent presence of Christianity in Australia came with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. As a British colony, the predominant Christian denomination was the Church of England. In early colonial times, Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Richard Johnson, Anglican chaplain to the First Fleet, was charged by the governor, Arthur Phillip, with improving \\"public morality\\" in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and the organisation of schooling. The first schools in Australia were Christian schools established by the Church of England in the early days of British settlement in the late 1700s. Free \\"charity schools\\" run by other denominations gradually came into existence later. Roman Catholic convicts were initially compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Anglicans. At the instigation of the then British Prime Minister and the Duke of Wellington - and with the patronage of King William IV - Australia's oldest surviving independent school, The King's School, Parramatta, was founded in 1831 as part of an effort to establish grammar schools in the colony. The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales by the Church Act of 1836. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists. In 1872, Victoria became the first Australian colony to pass an education act providing for free and secular public education. The other colonies followed over the following two decades. Though an enduring network of Anglican schools had already begun to be established, the subsequent withdrawal of state aid for church schools did not prompt the Anglican Church to rigorously set out to establish of an independent network as did the Roman Catholic Church in Australia. The Anglican Schools Commission (ASC) was established in 1985 and given the role of creating affordable Christian education in the Anglican tradition accessible to the disadvantaged and children with disabilities. The Australian Anglican Schools Network is the Educational Network of the Australian General Synod. The Anglican Education Commission was re-established by the Synod in 2007 in an effort to advance the Sydney diocese's commitment to bolstering Christian education and assisting both teachers and workers involved in education to do so through the lens of the Gospel's values. In the 21st century, the church remains a significant provider of social welfare and education. There are around 145 Anglican schools in Australia, providing for more than 105,000 children. Church affiliated schools range from low-fee, regional and special needs schools to high-fee leading independent schools such as Geelong Grammar (whose alumni include Prince Charles and Rupert Murdoch); Melbourne Grammar School (alma mater to Barry Humphries) and Sydney's King's School, Abbotsleigh, Sydney Church of England Grammar School, SCEGGS Darlinghurst, Canberra Grammar School, The Scots College and The Southport School in Queensland. Administration and funding In Australia, the state and territory governments have the primary responsibility for funding state government schools and also provide supplementary assistance to non-government schools, while the Australian Federal Government is the primary source of public funding for non-government schools (while also providing supplementary assistance to government schools). These public funds subsidise the fees paid by parents for the education of their children at Anglican schools, with the overall effect of reducing the numbers and therefore burden on public funding for government schools. Most non-government schools have some religious affiliation (with approximately two-thirds of their students enrolled in Catholic schools). In the final year of secondary schooling, students at both government and non-government schools sit for a government- endorsed certificate that is recognised by all Australian universities and vocational education and training institutions. Thus, Anglican schools may freely teach and encourage religious studies, values and community engagement but must adhere to the broader requirements of Australia's secular education system. Ethos While Anglican schools must adhere to the broad requirements of Australia's secular education system, they are free to provide an \\"Anglican\\" ethos and Christian education. Furthermore, Anglican schools adopt the values of the Gospel within the educational domain.

Although five occupation regimes had originally been envisaged it was eventually dropped because it did not carry a specific political objective, and because the German authorities had decided by the second half of May 1941 to limit the number of administrative units that were to be established in the east to four. At Rosenberg's suggestion its territory was divided between the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and Reichskommissariat Kaukasus, which was accepted by Adolf Hitler. Other sources state its territory as covering 55.000 km2, and including only territory later added to Reichskommissariat Ukraine, comprising its eventually planned Generalbezirke Rostov, Voronezh, and Saratov.Kosyk, Volodymyr (1993).

The Ukrainian American Veterans (UAV) () is a 501(c)(19) non-profit organization of the United States, composed of Honorably Discharged Veterans of the United States Armed Forces, who are of Ukrainian heritage or descent. The UAV obtained its tax- exempt status from the IRS in 1984 and was incorporated in the State of New York in 1987. The organization is governed by a volunteer National Executive Board (NEB), headed by a National Commander, elected at a National Convention. Purpose =Mission= In the introduction to its National Constitution, the Mission of the Ukrainian American Veterans is stated: The UAV seeks to unite American Veterans of Ukrainian descent and is pledged to sustain the Constitution, Government and Laws of the United States.\\"Mission Statement.\\" Ukrainian American Veterans, National Constitution and By-Laws, 2010 Edition\\" =Objectives= In Article II of its National Constitution, the following Objectives of the Ukrainian American Veterans are listed: a) To unite, strengthen, and preserve in comradeship, all American Veterans of Ukrainian descent. b) To perpetuate the memory and deeds of our comrades who gave their lives to secure, for us, the blessings of Liberty. c) To foster and perpetuate our American way of life. d) To uphold the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America. e) To guard and defend the United States of America from all her enemies. f) To promote a spirit of peace and goodwill amongst all the peoples on earth. g) To preserve the principles of Justice, Liberty and Democracy for ourselves and our posterity. h) To assist all comrades in distress as well as all the widows and orphans of our fallen comrades. i) To maintain the Ukrainian identity in a status of high esteem and respect in these, our United States. j) To provide scholarships to students who are descendants of or related to Ukrainian American veterans.\\"Article II, Objectives.\\" Ukrainian American Veterans, National Constitution and By-Laws, 2010 Edition\\" History Ukrainian American Veterans gather after raising a POW-MIA Flag in Philadelphia, Pa. Ukrainian American Veterans Post 1 was formed in September 1921 in Philadelphia. Other posts were organized in different cities, but due to great distance and lack of numbers, a national organization did not materialize in this time period. After World War II, a larger number of veterans emerged, new posts were formed, and interest rose in creating an organization of national scope. During the 1947 Convention of the Ukrainian Youth League of North America, several delegates met and expressed their desire to form such an association. Major Michael Darmopray (Ukrainian transliteration as Darmohray) made the preparations for Post 1 to host a National Convention at the Penn Sheraton Hotel in Philadelphia, during Memorial Day Weekend of 1948 (May 29‚Äì31, 1948). Fifty-five delegates arrived to participate in the first National Convention, from such cities as Bayonne, N.J., Clifton, N.J., Newark, N.J., New York City, N.Y., Perth Amboy, N.J., Philadelphia, Pa., Rome, N.Y., and Troy, N.Y. The delegates discussed variations on a name for the group, and settled on Ukrainian American Veterans. A Constitution and By-Laws was adopted. A National Commander and National Executive Board were elected to lead the organization. Various resolutions were adopted, and it was decided that subsequent conventions would be held on an annual basis. Membership eligibility requirements Any person of Ukrainian heritage or descent shall be eligible for membership in the Ukrainian American Veterans, if such person has served in the Armed Forces of the United States and has been honorably discharged. Any person who is not of Ukrainian descent, but who meets other requirements of eligibility and is married to a person of Ukrainian descent will be eligible for full membership in the UAV.\\"Article VI, Eligibility.\\" Ukrainian American Veterans, National Constitution and By-Laws, 2010 Edition\\" Organizational structure =Posts= The Post is the basic unit of the UAV and usually represents a local geographic area such as a metropolitan area, city, town, or county. The Post is used for formal business such as meetings and a coordination point for local projects. Often the Post will host community events such as bingo, breakfasts, and holiday celebrations. It is also not uncommon for the Post to contain a bar open during limited hours. A Post member is distinguished by a navy blue garrison cap with gold lettering and gold piping. Members of the UAV New Jersey State Dept. mark Ukrainian Independence Day =State departments= The Posts are grouped together into a state level organization known as a State Department for the purposes of coordination and administration. There can be a total of 51 State Departments; one for each of the 50 states, and the District of Columbia. A State Department Commander or Department Board Officer is distinguished by a white garrison cap with blue lettering and blue piping. =National executive board= The authority of the Ukrainian American Veterans is vested in the National Executive Board (NEB), which meets quarterly or as needed, to conduct the business of the organization. The NEB is headed by a National Commander, who presides over meetings. Other NEB officers may include: Vice Commander, Adjutant, Judge Advocate, Finance Officer, Quartermaster, Chaplain, Historian, Public Relations Officer. A National Commander is distinguished by a gold garrison cap with blue lettering and blue piping. An Officer of the National Executive Board is distinguished by a garrison cap with a blue crown and gold peak, gold lettering and gold piping. =Ladies Auxiliary= A Ladies Auxiliary to the Ukrainian American Veterans has been established. The Ukrainian American Veterans Ladies Auxiliary is a U.S.-headquartered patriotic service organization for women interested in voluntary service. It is a non-profit organization, affiliated with The Ukrainian American Veterans. Although individual Ladies Auxiliary units existed alongside UAV Posts prior to the 1948 Convention, a National organization did not materialize until March, 1974. Rosalie Polche was elected temporary President to lead the group at that time. At the 27th UAV National Convention, in June 1974, at Jersey City, N.J., the Ladies Auxiliary was officially recognized as a part of the Ukrainian American Veterans organization. A Constitution and By-Laws was adopted the following year, in June 1975, at the National Convention in Spring Valley, N.Y. The Ukrainian American Veterans Ladies Auxiliary is an organization with dedicated, empowered women across the country, who are devoted to America's veterans, children and youth, with the notion of inspiring Auxiliary members' communities. Activities =Patriotic= The Ukrainian American Veterans organize and participate in various patriotic ceremonies, including: Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, and others. These are usually hosted at the Post level. The ceremonies may include visitation to cemeteries and marching in parades. Many individual UAV Posts have placed memorial markers or monuments in a cemetery that is centrally located for them. These monuments are the gathering place for members during Memorial Day and Veterans Day services. Members of UAV Florida Post 40 mark Memorial Day Many Posts also commemorate Ukrainian Independence Day as a holiday, which was observed on January 22 in the past. After 1991, the date of observance was changed to August 24. Representatives of UAV State Departments often participate in patriotic ceremonies, such as Proclamation signings that are sponsored by the Governor's Office or Resolution readings that are passed by the State Legislature. State Department Officers are also frequently invited to attend an annual \\"Governor's Review\\" of the State's National Guard troops. At the National level, the UAV participated in a ceremony in Washington, D.C., on June 27, 1964, at the dedication of the Taras Shevchenko statue. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower was present as the keynote speaker. The UAV participated and marched in a parade in Washington, D.C., on June 24, 1976, to mark the Bicentennial of American Independence, sponsored by the Ukrainian Bicentennial Committee. A few days later, on June 27, 1976, the Ukrainian American Veterans, along with representatives of the Veterans of the First Division of the Ukrainian National Army, laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. The wreath laying was preceded by a memorial service (Moleben), which was conducted jointly by Metropolitan Mstyslav Skrypnyk of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA, and Bishop Basil Losten of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. UAV National Commander Harry Polche was quoted during the ceremony: We stand here with pride and reverence, and we pause a moment to remember all the brave men who gave their lives for this country throughout its history. They paid the supreme sacrifice for freedom, for human dignity, for everyone's hopes and dreams and rights, above all, for peace in the world. We pray that the world will achieve that peace soon. The UAV has placed a Memorial Plaque at the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii. Past National Commander Bohdan Bezkorowajny, accompanied by his wife Anne of the UAV Ladies Auxiliary and Past National Commander Walter Bacad, presented the plaque to the U.S. Navy in 1980. The UAV has also placed a Memorial Plaque at Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, D.C. An additional Marker was placed at Fort Custer National Cemetery in Michigan, in 1996. In 2005, National Commander Anna Krawczuk announced that a UAV National Monument would be built at St. Andrew's Ukrainian Orthodox Cemetery, in South Bound Brook, New Jersey. The UAV Monument would be an ideal gathering place on St. Thomas Sunday and other holidays, to remember all Ukrainian American Veterans. =Charitable= Since the creation of the Ukrainian American Veterans, one of the main activities of the group has been to work on charitable projects, such as the Welfare Fund, Scholarship Fund, and sending aid to Ukraine. Welfare fund After the National UAV was established, there was a desire among the membership to have a \\"National Welfare Fund\\" to assist veterans in need. The by-laws of the fund changed several times over the years; the version adopted in 1992 is the one currently in use: The purpose of the National Welfare Fund is to provide assistance in the form of grants to veteran members, their families, or an Ukrainian American Veterans Post, as aid in times of distress; also to provide gifts or grants to the Ukrainian American men or women serving in the Armed Forces of the United States. This article provides grants to veterans who underwent major surgery, had a prolonged stay in the hospital, and were in dire need of funds. An annual fund drive is conducted by the National Welfare Officer to replenish the Welfare Fund. Post Commanders apply for a Welfare Fund grant or loan on behalf of a post member. Neither a Post Commander nor the National Welfare Officer is permitted to disclose the name of the applicant. Scholarship fund The 48th National Convention authorized the creation of a National Scholarship Fund and the election of a Scholarship Officer to the National Executive Board. The Scholarship Officer conducts an annual fund drive to replenish the scholarship fund, and selects a Scholarship Committee which reviews applications and awards scholarships. To be eligible for a UAV scholarship, applicants must be descendants or related to a Ukrainian American Veteran and be a full-time matriculated college student in a degree program. Undergraduate students may reapply for scholarship awards up to four times. Aid to Ukraine After Ukraine obtained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, sending aid to Ukraine became a new activity for the Ukrainian American Veterans. Dr. Ihor Zachary of Ohio Post 24 may have been the earliest organizer of aid, when he worked with the Children of Chernobyl Relief Fund Committee in August 1992 to bring the world's largest aircraft, the AN-225 Mria, to Rickenbacker International Airport in Columbus, Ohio. The crew of the plane was on a mission to collect medicine and medical instruments for the children of Chornobyl. In 1993, Robert Gulay of New Jersey Post 25 started the \\"Adopt a Hospital\\" project, with the assistance of NJ State Commander George A. Miziuk. The Adopt a Hospital Program involved contacting hospitals in the state, and asking them to donate their surplus medical equipment, which was then shipped to hospitals in Ukraine. Enthusiasm for the project was so great from members, that all of the posts in New Jersey participated, and the posts in surrounding states (Connecticut and New York) wanted to pitch in. In 1993, National Commander Roman Rakowsky wrote to President Bill Clinton, voicing his concern about the U.S. Veterans Administration distribution of duplicate medical journals to Russia, but not other former Soviet republics. The result was, the U.S. Administration released duplicates of medical journals to Ohio Post 24, which shipped them to Ukraine. From May 22 to June 1, 1995, the Armed Forces of the U.S. and Ukraine conducted joint peacekeeping exercises in the Lviv area, known as \\"Operation Peace Shield\\". The U.S. forces were assisted by Major General (ret.) Nicholas S. H. Krawciw, former commander of the 3rd Infantry Division (1987‚Äì1989), who not only translated but also acted as a facilitator between generals of both armies. About a dozen other Ukrainian-speaking military officers and NCOs accompanied the U.S. Forces as interpreters, including Spc. Yaro Rohowsky, Maj. Roman Golash, Spc. Bohdan –ú–∞–∫, Maj. Roman Hayda, Maj. Gregory Perchatsch, Capt. Lia Mastronardi, Spc. Peter Lysenko, Spc. Oleg Sopel and others. Having fluent linguists was essential for this mission. Since January 1995, Lt. Col. Yaro Oryshkevych M.D., D.C. Air National Guard, has been building a database of fluent Ukrainian speakers in both the active and reserve components of all branches of the service. Overall, Operation Peace Shield had 17 Ukrainian speakers and 19 Russian speakers. Many of the Ukrainian-speaking personnel were also UAV members. In 1999, Commander Taras Szczur of New York Post 301 organized and sent aid to different Ukrainian freight ships, which were stranded in New York Harbor. The Post sent hundreds of pounds of meat, rice and other provisions to the Mikhail Stenko in April and did the same for the Banner of October in August. =Community activity= UAV members have served in various roles as community representatives and leaders. In 1978, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed Executive Order 65, which established the Ethnic Advisory Council in the state. In 1982, Governor Tom Kean appointed Andrew Keybida of N.J. Post 17 as a Ukrainian representative and the first Ukrainian American Veteran member to serve on the Ethnic Advisory Council. Keybida would serve on the Council for 10 years, well into the term of the next Governor, James J. Florio. In 1994, Governor Christine Todd-Whitman appointed George A. Miziuk of N.J. Post 25 as a Ukrainian representative on the Ethnic Advisory Council. Miziuk would serve for three years, until he moved to Florida and gave up the position. In 1980, Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh established the Pennsylvania Heritage Affairs Advisory Commission, and appointed Past National Commander Walter \\"Tommy\\" Darmopray of Penna. Post 1 as a Ukrainian representative on the Commission. In 1991, New Jersey Commissioner of Veteran Affairs Dick Bernard (under Governor James J. Florio) invited State Commander George A. Miziuk to serve as an advisor to the N.J. State Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission. Miziuk served for two years as an advisor. The New Jersey Vietnam Veterans Memorial was completed and unveiled in 1995. UAV N.J. Post 30 has a special marker dedicated to Major Myron F. Diduryk at the State Memorial. In 1993, Past National Commander Roman Rakowsky of Ohio Post 24 served as a juror on a Cleveland Veterans committee to select a design for a memorial to be erected on Memorial Plaza, Cleveland Mall \\"A\\" for war casualties. =Social= In addition to its formal activities, the UAV exists as a social group where members can share camaraderie with other American veterans of Ukrainian heritage. Social activities, mainly organized at the Post level, can vary anywhere from barbecues, baseball games, and bingo, to banquets and ballroom dances. However, social contacts have also reached beyond the members of the UAV. In 1991, Ohio Post 24 and the Lviv-based Ukrainian Veterans of Afghanistan signed a ‚Äústatement of understanding‚Äù to encourage a future relationship to exchange information.

Adamah (Biblical Hebrew : ◊ê◊ì◊û◊î) is a word, translatable as ground or earth, which occurs in the Biblical account of Creation of the Book of Genesis. The etymological link between the word adamah and the word adam is used to reinforce the teleological link between humankind and the ground, emphasising both the way in which man was created to cultivate the world, and how he originated from the \\"dust of the ground\\". Because man is both made from the adamah and inhabits it, his duty to realise his own potential is linked to a corresponding duty to the earth. In Eden, the adamah has primarily positive connotations, although Adam's close relationship with the adamah has been interpreted as likening him to the serpent, which crawls upon the ground, thus emphasising his animal nature. After the fall of man, the adamah is duly corrupted with Adam's punishment of lifelong agricultural toil. This explains why God favours Abel's sacrifice of sheep to Cain's offering of the \\"land's produce\\" - Abel has progressed from the sin of his father, while Cain has not. The adamah is also complicit in Cain's later murder of Abel, swallowing Abel's innocent blood as if to try to conceal the crime. God punishes Cain by making the ground barren to him, estranging him from the adamah. In Hebrew, adamah is a feminine form, and the word has strong connections with woman in theology. One analogy is that the adamah is to man as a woman is to her husband: man has a duty to cultivate the earth in the same way that a husband has a duty to be fruitful with his wife. Irenaeus likened the Virgin Mary, who bore the Christ, to the adamah from which Adam came.  Etymology  Adam (◊ê◊ì◊ù) literally means \\"red\\", and there is an etymological connection between adam and adamah, adamah designating \\"red clay\\" or \\"red ground\\" in a non-theological context. In traditional Jewish theology, a strong etymological connection between the two words is often assumed. Maimonides believed the word adam to be derived from the word adamah, analogous to the way in which mankind was created from the ground. In contemporary biblical scholarship there is a general consensus that the words have an etymological relationship, but the exact nature of it is disputed. The word adam has no feminine form in Hebrew, but if it did, it would be adamah. However, it is considered unlikely that the word adamah is a feminization of \\"adam\\", and the prevailing hypothesis is that both words originate from the verbal stem \\"adam\\" (to be red) and were chosen by the author of Genesis to convey the relationship between man and the adamah. There is additional relationship between the words adam and adamah and the word dam (◊ì◊ù), meaning blood. This justifies the presence in the Kashrut of the prohibition of the consumption of blood: the blood of a slaughtered animal must be returned to the ground, and covered with earth. The concept could also date back to primitive woman's \\"birth magic,\\" or the making of clay manikins and anointing them with menstrual blood‚Äîthe sacred \\"blood of life\\"‚Äîin order to conceive real children. Women were still making clay manikins to represent people by sympathetic magic through such manikins, in the Middle Ages when such pursuits were redefined as witchcraft. Clay was always a \\"feminine\\" material, sacred to women because it was their substance earth. Pottery was a woman's art because of this time-honored association of ideas.  Role in Genesis  In the Jahwist's account of creation, God's first act is to create mankind from the adamah.

Currently, a 30-acre swim club is located there with two swimming pools, a volleyball court, picnic tables and grills, a creek, and snack house. The 200 foot deep freshwater quarry has floating platforms, two rolling logs, diving and jumping platforms, and a rope swing. The quarry began operation in the 19th century and much of the labor was that of Irish immigrants using hand drills, hammers and chisels. In 1878, Hugh Sisson acquired the property and began using the latest equipment available: steam powered derricks, shovels, and diamond bit drills. Stone was loaded onto wagons and pulled by oxen to the nearby Northern Central Railway in Cockeysville until the quarry site itself was connected to the rail in 1866. The dolomitic marble, known to geologists as the Cockeysville Marble, from the quarry was used widely within the eastern United States, including the Washington Monument in Baltimore and the one in Washington, D.C.

He was the last member of his family to own Wythenshawe Hall and its estate, the ancestral home of the Tattons for 600 years, and the last male member of his line. After selling his Wythenshawe estate to Manchester Corporation in 1926 Robert and his family moved first to Wybunbury in Cheshire and then to Kent, where Robert died the day before his 79th birthday. Early life Robert was the only son of Thomas Egerton Tatton and his wife Essex Mary Cholmondeley. He had two older sisters: Alice (1877‚Äì1929) and Eva Beatrice (born 1879). After completing his education Robert enlisted in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and rose to the rank of Captain. He married Maud n√©e Hamilton on 11 November 1911 in a ceremony held at the church of St Peter's in the East, Oxford. The couple had four children: William Grey Maurice (born 1912), Betty Catherine (born 1914), Susan, and Christopher (born 1922). Sale of Wythenshawe Robert's father died in 1924 leaving him the Wythenshawe estate, where Robert was already living with his wife and family. Manchester Corporation had been trying to buy the estate for some time, to develop much-needed housing for the city's rapidly expanding population, but Thomas had refused to sell. In 1926 Robert bowed to the inevitable and sold of land to the corporation. He also sold Wythenshawe Hall and of its surrounding parkland to Ernest Simon, who donated them to Manchester Corporation \\"to be used solely for the public good\\". Later life After leaving Wythenshawe Hall Robert and his family moved to Wybunbury, in the south of Cheshire. Shortly after the family home had been sold, Robert's eldest son, William Grey, died at school at Eton, aged 14. The Tattons remained in Wybunbury until the end of the Second World War, during which conflict their remaining son, Christopher, was killed in action when the battleship on which he was serving, HMS Prince of Wales, was sunk by the Japanese in 1941. After the war the family moved to Kent, where Robert died on 1 March 1962, the last of the male line of his family.

American Museum of Natural History, https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/petra/icons-of-the-gods/khirbet-ed-dharih. Accessed 13 June 2020. The site is located in southern Jordan, in the city of Tafileh, 100 km north of Petra. The earliest signs of human habitation at the site are from the Neolithic period and more specifically the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period circa 4000-6000 BCE. In Arabic, khirbet means ruin and is commonly used to describe archaeological ruins, while the word Al Dharih according to the Arabic Dictionary ,Maajim.Com, https://www.maajim.com/dictionary means hills or highlands. Khirbet ed- Dharih therefor can be translated as the ruin‚Äôs of ed- Dharih or the ruins of the highlands. The site name reflects the topography of the site. History of archaeological excavation at the site Khirbet ed-Dharih has been excavated by archaeologists over 13 seasons between the years 1984 and 2007. The importance of the site centers around its ability to provide important answers to questions about life outside of the capital at Petra during the Nabatean period. In particular, the site sheds light on aspects of religious, social, and economic life in the Nabatean period. The site is surrounded by fertile agricultural land and well-watered by spring water, such as the Le‚Äôban spring, all of which contributed to making the site a natural center for human habitation.Zeirdoun Al-Muheisen.The Technology of the Nabataean Water Distribution. Yarmouk University. 2007. Archaeological evidence indicates that Khirbet ed Dharih was settled as early as the Pre Pottery Neolithic period (4000-6000 BCE) and continued into the bronze age. Archaeologist Zeidoun Al Muheisin and Fran√ßois Villeneuve argue that Edomite artifacts found at the site confirm that it was settled during the Edomite period. The site became of particular significance in the Nabatean period, however, there is evidence to suggest continuous settlement at the site throughout the Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods. Geographic location Jordanian archeologist Zaidoun Al Muheisin describes the location of ed-Darih:Al-Muhaisen, Zaydun, Nabatean Civilization, First Edition, Irbid, 2004 ‚ÄúSituated at the northern end of Wadi Al Le‚Äôban (ŸàÿßÿØŸä ÿßŸÑŸÑÿπÿ®ÿßŸÜ) in the south of Jordan. Wadi Al Le‚Äôban, located northeast of the city of Tafileh is one of the main tributaries of Wadi al Hassa, which includes many water basins, the most important of which are the Thahr Al Le‚Äôban and Ayn Al Le‚Äôban (Le‚Äôban Spring). This region consists of a relatively flat plateau which is 10 km from north to south and 30 km from east to west. The climate and vegetation of the plateau varied widely, in some areas the land was very fertile in others not at all. The land becomes less fertile as you move east towards the desert. The area to the west of the Wadi Al-Le‚Äôban was cultivated with grains, especially wheat. It enjoys a traditional Mediterranean climate with its wet winters and dry summers. The highlands receive most of the rain and even snow. The longest valleys of the plateau are less than 10 km long, with the exception of the Wadi Al-Le‚Äôban, which connects to the Al-Hasma valley with a length of 25 km stretching from its source in Mount Tannour.Roller (1983): 173-174. The red soil of this region is classified as Terra Rossa Mediterranee, which is commonly found in the Mediterranean basin. The area is well known for its many springs (ayn in Arabic) such as Ain ed-Dharih, Ain al-Thaban, Ain al-Fadhah, and these springs are an important source for the irrigation of agricultural lands. Khirbet ed- Dhairh is famous for the cultivation of olive trees, grapevines, grains, cereals, and various types of vegetables.Moheisin and Villeneuve 1990: 5. The average rainfall in the region is 200 mm per annum. Khirbet ed-Darih was distinguished by its strategic geographic location, due to its proximity to the major trade routes, in addition to the minor subsidiary trade routes leading to the Jordan Valley, Palestine and Gaza. The importance of the site is also due, especially in the Nabataean period, to its proximity to the temple of Khirbet al-Tannour, which is about 7 km north. Khirbet al- Tannour, which was built on top of the high mountain of Tannour, was one of the most important religious centers and a site of pilgrimage for the Nabateans. This site is also of importance due to its proximity to the hot springs of Afra and Rabita spots, both located a few kilometers away to the west.Fouilles √† Khirbet-Edh-Dharih (Jordanie), 1984-1987 - un village, son sanctuaire et sa n√©cropole aux √©poques nabat√©enne et romaine (Ie - IVe si√®cles ap.

Biography Born in Alt√∂tting, Bavaria, Lutzenberger studied engineering at the Technical University Munich. Since an early age, he found pleasure in painting and drawing. He worked as an architect in Dresden (1909) and Wiesbaden (1912‚Äì1913), and was a pupil of Osvald Pol√≠vka (1910) in Prague and of Georg S√º√üenguth and Heinrich Reinhardt (1911) in Berlin. When the First World War began in 1914, Lutzenberger served within the German armed forces as a weapon designer, having fought against the Allies in France and Belgium. During the war truces, he would paint and draw military scenes and landscapes. When he arrived in Porto Alegre in 1920, Lutzenberger was hired by Weiss CIA, a construction company, and designed important buildings in the city, such as the Igreja S√£o Jos√©, the Pal√°cio do Com√©rcio, and the Instituto P√£o dos Pobres. As an architect, Lutzenberger had a sober and functional eclectic style. Besides Porto Alegre, he also executed other buildings in cities like Caxias do Sul, Novo Hamburgo, Lajeado and Santa Cruz do Sul. In 1938, he started teaching in the Instituto de Belas Artes, which belongs to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul nowadays. There he was a professor of decorative arts and descriptive geometry. As an artist, Lutzenberger liked to paint the city with its inhabitants, houses and traditions, the war, and the country life. A low-profile person, he displayed an exhibition of his works only once in life, during the Ragamuffin War centenary celebrations, in 1935. He and his wife Emma Kroeff had three children. Their only son, Jos√© Lutzenberger, was a famous environmentalist in Brazil. The Kroeff-Lutzenberger home was bilingual German and Portuguese, like millions of others in southern Brazil.

Currently in Chile, only 45% of high school students study in traditional public schools and most universities are also private. No new public universities have been built since the end of the Chilean transition to democracy in 1990, even though the number of university students has swelled. Beyond the specific demands regarding education, there is a feeling that the protests reflect a \\"deep discontent\\" among some parts of society with Chile's high level of inequality. Protests have included massive non-violent marches, but also a considerable amount of violence on the part of a side of protestors as well as riot police. The first clear government response to the protests was a proposal for a new education fund and a cabinet shuffle which replaced Minister of Education Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠nCanales, Javier. La Tercera July 18, 2011. Access date July 18, 2011 and was seen as not fundamentally addressing student movement concerns. Other government proposals were also rejected. Student protestors have not achieved all their objectives, but they contributed to a dramatic fall in Pi√±era's approval rating, which was measured at 26‚Äì30% in August 2011 polls by respected Chilean pollsters and had not increased by January 2012. Background Protest march in Santiago during the 2006 Penguin Revolution The onset of the 2011 Chilean protests have been attributed to several causes. The Economist explained the protests as being the result of \\"one of world‚Äôs lowest levels of public funding for higher education, some of the longest degrees and no comprehensive system of student grants or subsidized loans\\" and a flat job market as the detonant.The struggle to make the grade, The Economist, October 8, 2011. Historian Gabriel Salazar describes the student conflict as being the continuation of a long strife between popular citizen movements and civic and military dictatorships. BBC have attributed \\"students' anger\\" to \\"a perception that Chile's education system is grossly unfair ‚Äì that it gives rich students access to some of the best schooling in Latin America while dumping poor pupils in shabby, under-funded state schools.\\"Chile student protests point to deep discontent, BBC Many newspapers and analysts have traced the protests back to the 2006 Penguin Revolution that occurred during the government of Michelle Bachelet, some claiming that these are the same secondary students who headed the 2006 movement that when in university are heading the 2011 student protests.De protesterar f√∂r att n√§sta generation ska f√• en god utbildning ERGO, October 2011 Bachelet has defended the legacy of her government and said that in the aftermath of the Penguin Revolution the right-wing opposition prevented them from eliminating for-profit activity in education.Bachelet y educaci√≥n: Quisimos avanzar, no pudimos; hoy est√° la oportunidad, Emol, October 7, 2011. Right-wing politician Cristi√°n Monckeberg responded to this by saying that if Bachelet had solved the problem in 2006, the students would not be protesting now.RN: Si Bachelet hubiese resuelto los problemas los estudiantes no estar√≠an marchando, Emol, October 8, 2011. On June 5 it was noted in the Chilean TV discussion show Tolerancia Cero that the Chilean students protests followed a cyclic pattern with major protests every 5 or 7 years. V√≠ctor Lobos, intendant of Biob√≠o Region attributed the protests to the increasing number of children born outside matrimony claiming that this condition made them susceptible to \\"anarchism\\".Intendente del Biob√≠o atribuye a \\"hijos fuera del matrimonio\\" el estallido social, Emol, August 25, 2011.  Demands  Protest march in Santiago, 14 July 2011 =University students= University students are represented by CONFECH, the Confederation of Chilean Student Federations, a national body made up of student governments at Chilean universities and led by Camila Vallejo of the University of Chile and Giorgio Jackson of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. The CONFECH's proposal, known as the \\"Social Agreement for Chilean Education\\" (Acuerdo Social por la Educaci√≥n Chilena), demands: * Increased state support for public universities, which currently finance their activities mostly through tuition * More equitable admissions process to prestigious universities, with less emphasis on the Prueba de Selecci√≥n Universitaria standardized test * Free public education, so access to higher education doesn't depend on families' economic situation. * Creation of a government agency to apply the law against profit in higher education and prosecute those universities that are allegedly using loopholes to profit. The students oppose direct (fellowship and voucher) and indirect government aid (government-backed loans) to for-profit schools. * A more serious accreditation process to improve quality and end indirect state support for poor quality institutions * Creation of an \\"intercultural university\\" that meets the unique demands of Mapuche students * Repeal of laws forbidding student participation in university governance =High school students= High school students are more loosely organized than the university students, with no national federation. However, their demands have also been included in CONFECH's proposal and include: * Central government control over secondary and primary public schools, to replace the current system of municipal control which allegedly leads to inequalities * The application of Chile's school voucher system in pre-school, primary and secondary levels be applicable only to nonprofit schools. The Chilean system, although defended by researchers linked to the conservative Heritage Foundation, is criticized by researchers like Martin Carnoy, Lessons of Chile's Voucher Reform Movement, Martin Carnoy blaming it for the tremendous inequalities across all the Chilean educational system, measured by OECD's standards. * Increases in state spending. Chile only spends 4.4% of GDP on education, compared to the 7% of GDP recommended by the UN for developed nations. Additionally, Chile ranks behind only Peru in educational segregation among the 65 countries that take the PISA test. Prominent Chilean education researcher Mario Waissbluth has called the Chilean system \\"educational apartheid\\" * Use of student bus pass throughout the year * Development of more vocational high schools * Reconstruction of schools damaged during the 2010 Chilean earthquake * Moratorium on the creation of new voucher/charter schools * Higher pay for teachers and a national plan to attract the best talent to the profession and raise its social stature. Additionally, some segments of the student movement have called for additional changes, such as a constitutional amendment guaranteeing quality education, an increase in the tax rate of higher earners (which is low in comparison to OECD countries), . higher taxes for foreign extractors of or renationalization of Chile's copper resources.  First wave of protests  Liceo Andres Bello currently occupied by students, commune of San Miguel, Chile, from on June 13, 2011. The 2011 student protests in Chile began gradually in May, and can be traced to the so-called \\"penguin revolution\\", or 2006 student protests in Chile. It is also important to note that the student protests began on the heels of other national protests, over the HidroAys√©n dam project and gas prices in Magallanes Province. The protests are commonly portrayed as a new social movement loosely based on Spain's 15-M Movement or even the Arab Spring. The protests were triggered in part by the initiative of the then- Minister of Education Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠n to increase government funding of non- traditional Universities. Although, officially nonprofit, some of these institutions were known to use legal loopholes to turn profits. Lav√≠n had invested in several firms that render services to Universidad del Desarrollo. According to students cited by El Mercurio on June 13, there were 100 schools being occupied by students as a form of protest,Estudiantes secundarios se han tomado cerca de cien colegios en todo el pa√≠s, Emol of which 80 were in the Santiago Metropolitan Region Secundarios entregar√°n petitorio al subsecretario de Educaci√≥n, La Tercera Sources differ; Chilean police listed on June 13 only 50 schools as occupied. On June 30, there was a massive demonstration that mobilized between one hundred and two hundred thousand demonstrators. The student protests have included several creative acts which received foreign media attention, such as flash mobs and kiss-ins. July 2011 government proposal Chilean president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era announcing with then- Education Minister Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠n a series of proposals in a televised speech On July 5 Chilean President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era announced in a televised speech educational reforms that his government planned to do in order to satisfy the student demands. The plans announced revolved mainly around a project labelled \\"GANE\\" (Spanish acronym for Grand National Accord of Education, forming the Spanish word for win), which would cost 4 billion dollars.Cadena Nacional de Radio y Televisi√≥n: Presidente Pi√±era anunci√≥ Gran Acuerdo Nacional por la Educaci√≥n Government of Chile. July 5, 2011. Accessdate July 5, 2011 The project is to be, if implemented, financed from the Funds of Economical and Social Stabilization (Fondo de Estabilizaci√≥n Econ√≥mica y Social or FEES) with which a fund named Fund for the Education (Fondo por la Educaci√≥n) will be created from which the dividends and interest (under 300 million dollars) will be used annually to support public education. Pi√±era also announced the shaping of a new legal framework for universities which will allow higher education providers to legally engage in for-profit activity and rejected the public ownership of education proposed by students as a \\"serious mistake and something that damages deeply the quality as well as the freedom of education\\". The announcement was received with skepticism by students, some of whom criticized harshly the announcements. Camila Vallejo, one of the movement's spokespersons and the president of the University of Chile student federation said that the presidential discourse \\"was a great disappointment and a backward step\\" and emphasized that the proposal to legalize for-profit activity in education, which is currently illegal but widely practised in private institutions, goes against the Chilean state of law and that the government rejected categorically the main point presented by the secondary students which was to place public secondary and primary education under state management instead of being under municipalities.Camila Vallejo: El discurso de Pi√±era fue una gran decepci√≥n y un retroceso, Radio Cooperativa July 6, 2011 Accessdate July 6 of 2010 Additionally, some opposition senators from the center-left Concertaci√≥n criticized the speech, signaling that the proposal was not \\"in tune with the student movement\\"Senadores arremeten contra propuesta gubernamental para la educaci√≥n Oliveros, Iv√°n.

Students marched on July 14 together with contractors from El Teniente mine that were on strike in one of the largest protests since the return to democracy in Chile two decades prior. Although the protests were downplayed by the Chilean government, they were described as a complete success by the organizers. On July 18, Chilean Minister of Education Joaqu√≠n Lav√≠n was replaced by Felipe Bulnes, as President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era opted for a cabinet shuffle in response to the months of protest. The change came two weeks without any clear movement on the issues, Lav√≠n received a new ministerial role as Minister of Development and Planning. Meanwhile, the Chilean student federation insists that it will continue its occupations and other mobilizations, as well as attempt to broaden the movement into other political areas.http://diario.latercera.com/2011/07/17/01/contenido/pais/31-76796-9-confech- estudia-darle-proyeccion-politica-a-movimiento.shtml Hernandez, Alfonso.

August 2011 government proposal and subsequent protest An allegory of Uncle Sam represented by Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, asking for student grants at street protests. On August 1, the government of Sebastian Pi√±era introduced a new 21-point proposal to reorganize Chilean education from pre-school to higher education and thus reach an agreement with the student movement. The proposal included many of the students' demands, such as: * a constitutional guarantee to a quality education * allowing student participation in university governance * the end of local control over public secondary education * increase university scholarships and provide help for people with unpayable student debt However, student leaders did not accept the proposal and signalled that the student mobilizations would continue with a national strike and march on August 4 and an official written response on August 5. In interviews, they noted that the proposal did not criminalize profiteering in education, did not seek to provide free or equitable access to higher education, and was not specific. Using the same language that was used to describe the July proposal, the August proposal was called \\"a backward step\\" and \\"a band-aid solution.\\" The protests of August 4 were the most confrontational of the movement to date. 874 protestors were detained, and the center of Santiago was called a \\"state of siege\\" by University of Chile student federation president Camila Vallejo. Police cordoned off the streets and used tear gas. Protesters destroyed signs and set small fires in the street. Additionally, 90 carabineros (militarized police) were injured and a La Polar department store was burnt down. The evening saw a cacerolazo protest, where protesters bang pots and pans, often from their homes. Third government proposal On August 18, the government offered a third proposal for ending the conflict; primary among the new means was a reduction of government-backed student loan rates to 2% APR. However, this proposal still has not placated the students, who held a massive march (100,000 marchers) on that date and another massive (estimates of attendance from 100,000 to 1,000,000) concert/protest on August 21. =August 24‚Äì25 protests= March for free education in Pichilemu on August 25. Large sign says \\"We teachers that are marching, are also educating.\\" Sign at the right says \\"No more profit [in education]\\" The Workers' United Center of Chile organized a nationwide two-day strike on August 24 and 25. During the strike, four separate marches took place in Santiago, as well as additional protests across the country. According to union officials, a total of about 600,000 people were involved in protests. On the 24th, upwards of three hundred people were arrested, with six police officers wounded in Santiago, where protesters constructed roadblocks and damaged cars and buildings. On the 25th, another 450 people were arrested with several dozen reported injured. In Santiago, police forces used tear gas and water cannons on protesters at the end of the demonstrations; earlier, some protesters had thrown stones and started fires. One person, 16-year-old Manuel Gutierrez Reinoso, later died from gunshot wounds to the chest; witnesses claim that he was shot by a police officer. According to Claudio Urrutia, an official at the Workers' United Center of Chile, said that the Chilean government \\"is a right-wing government that has demonized social demonstrations [...] This government doesn't seek dialogue. We have to change the tax regime in this country.\\" According to Labor Minister Evelyn Matthei, unions had refused to begin discussions with the government, and she was \\"working actively trying to resolve problems [...] in education and in labor and many problems that come from the past.\\" On August 31, the Education Committee of the Chilean Senate approved 4-1 a bill that would prohibit indirect or direct state support of for-profit educational institutions, a fundamental demand of the student movement. Dialogue and carabineros controversy Pinochet coup anniversary protests On the 38th anniversary of Augusto Pinochet's 1973 coup d'√©tat against socialist president Salvador Allende on September 11, 2011, police arrested around 280 people in protests in Santiago. One 15-year-old girl suffered a bullet wound. \\"There were more than 350 places with barricades and blocked streets, and 130,000 homes suffered power cuts,\\" said Deputy Interior Minister Rodrigo Ubilla. A day later on September 12, 2011, 30 people stormed the headquarters of the Communist Party of Chile Central Committee assaulting party workers, and destroying computers and furniture. Carabineros attempted to storm the building on August 4. October breakdown of negotiations In October the student representatives engaged in negotiations with government representatives headed by education minister Felipe Bulnes. The students withdrew from negotiations October 5 citing that the government had in their words only proposed an improved version of their \\"GANE\\" proposal from July, something students considered a \\"provocation\\".Confech llama a \\"radicalizar movilizaci√≥n\\" y a no comenzar el segundo semestre, La Tercera, October 9 of 2011. Camila Vallejo said that it was government that broke the negotiations by lacking \\"political will\\" and \\"capacity to attend the demands of the majority of the country\\". Students reported that minister Felipe Bulnes attacked David Urrea during the negotiations saying to him \\"you came here to break the negotiations, you are in a hostile position\\". In a meeting held in the Isla Teja Campus of the Southern University of Chile the Chilean university students union (CONFECH) representative David Urrea made a call to radicalize the movement and to \\"prepare for harsh times\\". Government spokesman Andr√©s Chadwick blamed \\"the ultras\\" and \\"the intransigents\\" in the student movement as responsible for the breakdown of negotiations. Giorgio Jackson said of these comments that the label \\"ultra\\" form part of a strategy aimed to divide the student movement, a strategy Jackson said the government have been using since the beginning of the conflict. =October 18 and 19 strikes= =Parliament incident= Second cabinet shuffle In December 2011 Education Minister Felipe Bulnes was replaced by Harald Beyer, an analyst with the Center for Public Studies. Leadership changes =2012= In April 2012 Education Minister Harald Beyer proposed a new university funding plan, which would remove private sector banks from the process of granting student loans and reduce interest rates on loans from six to two percent. Gabriel Boric, president of the University of Chile Student Federation, rejected the plan, stating: \\"We don't want to trade debt for debt, which is what the government is offering us\\". A national student strike was organised for 28 June. The strike was marked with a march in Santiago which was attended by 150,000, according to the demonstration's organisers. In August 2012 a number of schools and universities including Instituto Nacional, Liceo Jos√© Victorino Lastarria and Universidad de Chile were occupied by students. The UNESCO seat in Santiago was also occupied by secondary students aiming to speak against the Hinzpeter Law at the UN. Government spokesman Andr√©s Chadwick rejected the demands of the students. =2013= Michelle Bachelet, member of the Chilean Socialist Party and candidate for a broad center-left coalition, won the presidential elections of 2013 stating that a principal objective of the New Majority coalition will be to achieve and establish a system of universal and free access to higher education within a time frame of six years. Meanwhile, in the elections for the Chilean parliament two ex main leaders of the protests, Camila Vallejo and Gabriel Boric became elected as members of parliament, one for the Chilean Communist Party and the other for the Autonomous Left party respectively. While this happened, the position of president of the University of Chile Student Federation, held previously by Vallejo and Boric, is now held by a member of an anarchist student organization (the Libertarian Students Federation), Melissa Sepulveda, who is a medical student. =2015= On October 14, 2015 members of CONFECH gathered at Plaza Italia in downtown Santiago and marched down Bernardo O'Higgins until they reached Echaurren Street. Due to increasing tuition and decreasing salaries, students and educators alike were advocating for structural changes surrounding Chile's for-profit education system that originated during the Pinochet Era. According to the Council of Hemispheric Affairs, Chile's current education system is \\"stratified\\" by socioeconomic status, making access to affordable education a contentious issue for today's youth. The U.S. Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) released an official warning to American companies based in Chile about potential violence between the student protesters and the militarized police force. As predicted, clashes between students and the carabineros gradually ensued. Known for retaliating harshly, the metropolitan police responded to paint bombs being thrown at their armored vehicles with water cannons against protesters. As mentioned in \\"Take Back the Streets: Repression and Criminalization of Protest Around the World,\\" Chilean law enforcement officers using \\"less-than lethal\\" weapons against demonstrators exemplifies the publication's proposal to increase regulation of less-lethal weapons, whether they be water cannons or tear gas. In accordance to Brooke Gladstone views on mainstream media bias in \\"The Influence Machine,\\" Chilean journalists have been criticized for their minimal coverage surrounding the ongoing student protests and cases of police brutality. For example, the 2015 Freedom of the Press Index declared that self-censorship and political bias is common in Chile where the media tends to promote governmental economic interests in addition to what some may call \\"infotainment.\\" See also * 2006 student protests in Chile * 2008 student protests in Chile * 2011 Magallanes protests * Leaders of the 2011 Chilean protests * List of protests in the 21st century References Category:Student strikes Category:Student protests in Chile Student protests Student protests Student protests Chile Category:2011 protests Category:2012 protests Category:2013 protests Category:Social history of Chile ","title":"2011‚Äì2013 Chilean student protests"},{"id":"32071893","text":"Hylaeogena is a genus of beetles in the family Buprestidae, containing the following species: * Hylaeogena achardi Obenberger, 1925 * Hylaeogena aeneonitens Hornburg, 2012Hornburg, M.

The ship received a light armament of three guns and was fitted to be capable of serving as an auxiliary minelayer. Completed in 1935, her experimental high-pressure steam turbines, which were installed to test them before they were used in destroyers, required significant modifications and the ship finally entered service in 1937. Over the next two years, she was used in a variety of roles, including as a training vessel and a target ship, in addition to her duties as a yacht. After the start of World War II in September 1939, Grille was used as a minelayer and as a patrol vessel in the Baltic Sea, tasked with searching for enemy merchant vessels. She collided with a German transport ship in January 1940 and after repairs, resumed minelaying duties in the North Sea, thereafter being used as a gunnery training ship. She was briefly assigned to the minelaying unit tasked with supporting Operation Sea Lion in September before the planned invasion of Britain was cancelled, and she was reassigned to the Baltic during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Gunnery training duties followed from August 1941 until March 1942, when she was reduced to a headquarters ship for the commander of naval forces based in occupied Norway; she served in this capacity for the rest of the war. Seized by British forces as war reparations in 1945, she was later sold either to a Lebanese businessman who intended to use the ship as a yacht or a Lebanese shipping company for use as a passenger vessel. During this period, she was involved in a collision in March 1947, and in November 1948, she was attacked by a Jewish saboteur with limpet mines after the intelligence arm of the Haganah incorrectly assessed the vessel as having been intended to attack the Jewish fleet. After repairs were completed, the owner instead brought the ship to the United States in 1949 in an unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer. He ultimately sold Grille for scrap in 1951. Design Grille sometime before the war Grille was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement was , and at full load, her displacement rose to . The ship had a crew of 248 officers and men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of two high-pressure geared turbines manufactured by Blohm & Voss, with steam provided by two Benson water-tube boilers that were ducted into a single raked funnel. Grille was equipped with these turbines to test them before they were installed in new destroyers. The engines were rated at , for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of . She was armed with three SK C/34 naval guns in individual mountings, one forward and two aft. She also carried four SK C/30 anti- aircraft guns in two dual mounts and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns in a single quadruple mount. Grille had provisions to carry up to 228 naval mines for service as an auxiliary minelayer. Service history =Construction and prewar career= Grille with the Italian heavy cruiser in 1936 The ship was built by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg; her keel was laid down in June 1934 under the provisional name \\"Flottentender 'C'\\" (fleet tender). She was launched on 15 December that year and was named Grille after the old aviso ; Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Eugen Lindau gave a speech at her launching ceremony. Following builder's sea trials off Helgoland, she was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine (War Navy) on 19 May 1935. Her first commander was Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Helmuth Brinkmann. The experimental high-pressure turbines with the Benson boilers proved to be unacceptable for use in warships, and Grille returned to Blohm & Voss to have the boilers replaced with a different type of boiler and control equipment for the turbines. The work was carried out between 3 October 1936 and 13 March 1937, after which the ship conducted a long-range test cruise to Iceland in July, which was completed without problems. For the next three years, Grille served in a variety of roles: she represented Adolf Hitler as the head of state of Nazi Germany and the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command), as a navigational training ship, and as a target ship during training exercises. Throughout this period, she was based in Kiel in the Baltic Sea. In May 1936, she embarked Hitler and Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander of the Kriegsmarine, and carried them to Laboe for the dedication of the Laboe Naval Memorial and observe a naval review. In October, she carried Generalfeldmarschall (General Field Marshal) Werner von Blomberg, the Minister of War on a visit to Norway, cruising as far north as Nordkapp. On the way back to Germany, she stopped in Narvik, Norway, where Blomberg and his entourage disembarked and traveled via train. Grille next carried the Wehrmacht (Defense Force) delegation to represent Germany for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in mid-May 1937. The ship visited Southampton and Spithead during the voyage. In early June, she served as the flagship for Admiral Rolf Carls, the commander of the German fleet, during exercises with the fleet's scouting force in the North Sea. Blomberg again boarded the vessel in October for a cruise into the Atlantic, which included visits to a series of ports, including Funchal, Madiera and Ponta Delgada in the Azores, Portugal. In May 1938, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) G√ºnther von der Forst replaced Brinkmann as the ship's captain. Another naval review was held on 22 August for the launching ceremony for the heavy cruiser , during which Grille hosted Hitler and his entourage, which included Mikl√≥s Horthy, the Regent of Hungary, who was visiting Germany at the time. Toward the end of 1938, Grille was used as a torpedo target for the aircraft of 3. Staffel, Group 506. The ship was then assigned to the Befehlshaber der Sicherung der Ostsee (BSO‚ÄîCommander of the Defense of the Baltic Sea) to support the planned Invasion of Poland. During the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June 1939, Grille hosted Raeder and several foreign naval officers. =World War II= Grille in Norway during World War II At the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, Grille was mobilized wartime service. She was initially used for minelaying operations, and from 1 to 9 September, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Marschall used her as a temporary flagship. Marschall was at that time the Befehlshaber der Panzerschiffe (Commander of Armored Ships). Grille was transferred back to the BSO in mid-September, where she was used to patrol for enemy merchant shipping in the Baltic. She accidentally collided with the German steamer on 10 January 1940, sinking the latter. Grilles bow was damaged in the incident and required repairs that were concluded on 5 February. The ship was then transferred to the North Sea to assist in the laying of minefields to guard against British attacks. She embarked on two operations to lay Minensperre (mine barrier) 16 in company with the light cruiser and several destroyers, the first on 17‚Äì18 May and the second on 19‚Äì20 May. Grille was then attached to the gunnery school for training purposes. For Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Great Britain in September 1940, Grille was assigned as the flagship of KzS Walter Krastel, the deputy commander of mine warfare vessels under Marinegruppenkommando Nord (Navy Group Command North). She led the Eastern Group to Ostend, Belgium in early September; the Eastern Group was tasked with covering the landing beaches by laying minefields on either side to prevent the British Royal Navy from intervening. The invasion was postponed \\"until further notice\\" on 17 September, and three days later Grille and the other vessels were moved to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The next day, the German high command cancelled the operation outright and Grille was immediately transferred back to the gunnery school. During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began in June 1941, Grille was again assigned to the minelayer command. She assisted in the laying of a minefield in the Baltic in late June, and she served as the unit flagship from 5 July to 15 August. She was transferred back to the gunnery school on 15 August, where she served for the next seven months. During this period, she was also used as a target ship for U-boat crews. She was decommissioned in March 1942 and on 24 August, was assigned as a stationary headquarters ship for the commander of naval forces in occupied Norway. She arrived in Narvik, where on 2 October, KAdm Otto Kl√ºber came aboard. The ship was moved from Narvik to Ankenes between 25 and 31 July 1943. She had her crew reduced there on 10 January 1944; she was still capable of going to sea, but lacked crew for her weapons. In March, the staff for the commander was reduced, and Grille was then used as a headquarters ship for the commander of U-boats in Norway, KzS Rudolf Peters. She remained in Norwegian waters until the end of the war in May 1945, when she was seized by British forces. They set up one of the rooms as \\"Eva Braun's bedroom\\", but she had never visited the ship. According to the naval historians J. J. Colledge and Ben Warlow, Grille returned to northern Germany at some point after the war, and it was there that she was occupied by British forces, in August 1945. =Postwar= Grille in Beirut in November 1948 The ship's postwar fate is uncertain; according to the naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz, Grille was sold in 1946 to a Lebanese shipping company for use as a passenger ship in the Mediterranean Sea. Others, including a contemporary report of the vessel's disposal in 1951, state that a Lebanese businessman named George Arida purchased the vessel for use as his personal yacht in September 1946. In March 1947, the ship was involved in a collision and repairs were completed in Beirut by November 1947, when she was re-launched from the dry dock. In either event, the ship had been disarmed and any equipment with military use was removed by the British before the sale. The intelligence service of the Haganah incorrectly suspected that Arida or the Lebanese company intended to use the vessel for the Lebanese Navy to attack Haifa, so they sent a saboteur to attack it with limpet mines in November 1948. The mines exploded a few days later and blew a hole in the hull below the waterline, but did little serious damage and Grille was quickly repaired. According to reports that indicate Arida purchased the ship, after he realized the very high cost involved in keeping the ship in service, he brought the ship to the United States in 1949 in an attempt to sell her. He was unable to secure a buyer, and Grille was instead moored in New York and left idle for the next two years. While there, the ship became a tourist attraction. In April 1951, she was sold for scrap to the North American Smelting and Refining Company and was transferred to the Doan Salvage Yard in Bordentown, New Jersey. The ship was broken up later that year. Before the scrapping began, souvenir hunters removed artifacts from the vessel. The yacht's toilet was one of many relics scattered throughout New Jersey, before it was purchased by British military memorabilia collector, Bruce Crompton. A blood transfusion kit taken from the Grille forms part of the permanent collection of the Thackray Medical Museum in Leeds, Britain. In October 2020 a Maryland auctioneer announced they would offer for sale a large aluminium globe-shaped bar with five barstools from the yacht.

Life The fifth son of Thomas Foster Barham (1766‚Äì1844), by his wife Mary Anne, daughter of the Rev. Mr. Morton, he was born 31 May 1808 at Leskinnick, Penzance, Cornwall, where his parents dwelt in independence and retirement. After a preliminary training in the grammar school of Penzance, he studied under one of his brothers near Epping Forest, and was then articled for five years (1826‚Äì31) to a solicitor at Devonport. His family's wealth came from slavery on sugar estates in western Jamaica.Richard Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2014). In his twenty-third year he was enrolled as an attorney, and settled in London, but ill-health prevented him from pursuing the practice of the law, and he took to writing for literary periodicals. Together with John Abraham Heraud he was joint editor and proprietor of the New Monthly Magazine from 1 July 1839 to 26 May 1840, when he retired from the editorship, with permission 'to contribute two sheets of matter to each number of the magazine, retaining exclusive property in his own articles'. During the fourteen years of his home in London, Barham's most extensive literary undertaking was the preparation of a new edition of Jeremy Collier's Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain. The study of oriental languages kindled in him a great love for philology, and his intense spiritual aspirations led him to attempt to found a new form of religion, which he called \\"Alism\\". He describes it as Barham founded a society of Alists and also a Syncretic Society. He likewise attached himself to an √¶sthetic society which met at the house of James Pierrepont Greaves. In 1844 he married Gertrude, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Grinfield, of Clifton, rector of Shirland, Derbyshire, and went to live at Clifton, Bristol. During his ten years' residence there, his time was principally occupied in preparing a revised version of the Old and New Testaments. He lived at Bath from 1854 until his death, which occurred in that city on 9 February 1871. His brother Charles Foster Barham was a notable doctor and also president of the Royal Institution of Cornwall.

It originally aired on BBC One and ITV in June 1969. The film attracted over 30 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reception was generally negative and the film has not been shown again on TV since 1972. Filming Royal Family was commissioned by Elizabeth II to celebrate the investiture of her eldest son, Charles, as Prince of Wales. It was directed by Richard Cawston, with the script by Antony Jay, narrated by Michael Flanders. The film was jointly produced by the BBC and ITV. It was the brainchild of William Heseltine, then royal Press Secretary, and the television producer John Brabourne (son-in-law of Lord Mountbatten), who both believed that showing the family's day-to-day life on TV would help to revive public interest in an institution widely seen, in the Swinging Sixties, as out of touch and irrelevant. Cawston was approached in March 1968, and filming began on 8 June at Trooping the Colour. A total of 43 hours of material were shot for the documentary. Editing started in March 1969, while filming came to an end in May. All scenes had to be agreed by an advisory committee chaired by the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. However, Cawston was allowed to shoot everything he wanted, later recounting \\"I never asked for things which I thought would be in bad taste; therefore, there was never any question of asking for something that would have to be turned down\\". The Queen saw the film in its entirety one month before the broadcast. Content The 110-minute documentary covers a year in the Queen's life. It gives an insight into the private side of the family as well as the role of monarchy in the 20th century. A typical day sets the tone, beginning with an official audience, followed by lunch and an afternoon garden party. In the evening, the Queen chooses a dress to wear to the opera. Later in the film she, Prince Philip, and their children enjoy a barbecue at Balmoral Castle, Scotland. In another scene, the Queen buys Prince Edward an ice-cream, disproving the myth that she never carried money. At one point, Charles is practicing the cello when a string snaps in his little brother Edward's face. Various members of the family are shown eating breakfast, watching television, water-skiing, playing host to the British Olympic team, and having lunch with Richard Nixon, the President of the United States. The film includes a royal tour of South America and also shows Princess Anne visiting a gas rig in the North Sea. Broadcasts Royal Family was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 June 1969, and on ITV the following week on 28 and 29 June. It was later broadcast in Australia on 21 September 1969. It was seen by 30.6 million viewers in the United Kingdom. The commentary had to be altered slightly for American audiences in a version that was broadcast in the US. Owing to the film's popularity, there was no televised Royal Christmas Message in 1969. Elizabeth issued a written message to avoid the possibility of over-exposure. The documentary was last shown on BBC television on 6 February 1972 to mark the 20th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne. The film is protected by Crown copyright and has not been shown since the 1970s. According to Heseltine, \\"we put very heavy restrictions on it because we realised it was a huge shift in attitude\\". In the 1990s, the film could be viewed privately at the BBC, by researchers, with permission from Buckingham Palace, for a fee of ¬£35. Broadcasters have been allowed to use short clips in other documentaries; for example, as part of the BBC's The Duke at 90 in 2011, to celebrate Prince Philip's 90th birthday. In 2011, it was announced that clips would be made available for public viewing as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. It formed part of an exhibition called Queen: Art and Image, which also featured photographs of the monarch from across the years. Reception Royal Family has been accused of revealing too much about the royals. David Attenborough ‚Äì at the time, controller of BBC Two ‚Äì warned Cawston that his film was in danger of \\"killing the monarchy\\". The film critic Milton Shulman wrote \\"every institution that has so far attempted to use TV to popularise or aggrandise itself has been trivialised by it\\". A review in The Times concluded that Cawston's film had given the nation \\"an intimate understanding of what members of the Royal Family are like as individual people without jeopardising their dignity or losing the sense of distance\\". The journalist and broadcaster Peregrine Worsthorne remarked \\"Initially the public will love seeing the Royal Family as not essentially different from anyone else ‚Ä¶ but in the not-so-long run familiarity will breed, if not contempt, familiarity\\". In later years, some blamed the film for a growing lack of deference towards the monarchy. However, William Heseltine had no regrets, calling it \\"a fantastic success\\".

The charity in which supports initiatives in Brazil, Malawi, Rwanda, Mozambique and the UK, addressing key issues such as sexual and reproductive health, substance abuse and gender equality. The band's debut single, \\"The Fall of Rome\\", was made available for free download on the project's official website.

Ben Ransom (born 16 February 1992 in Bexley, Kent) is an ex-rugby union player who last played for London Irish in the Greene King IPA Championship. He played at Fullback and has represented England at U16, U18 and U20 level. He was educated at Tonbridge School in Kent. He previously attended St Michael‚Äôs School, Otford and appeared for Old Elthamians, having first played the game at school and club when seven. The 2010-11 Aviva Premiership was the season Ransom made his debut for Saracens against the Northampton Saints and he was named man of the match. Overall in the season he made 4 appearances and scored 1 try. Having turned down an offer from the University of Bristol when signing for Sarries, he undertook a degree in economics at Hertfordshire University alongside playing rugby. In the six seasons he spent with Saracens, he made 44 appearances, along with 21 appearances on loan to Bedford Blues and helped the club win the Premiership title three times as well as the European Rugby Champions Cup. On 22 July it was announced that Ransom had joined newly relegated London Irish ahead of the 2016-17 season and his spell started well as they gained their first Championship title and promotion back to the Premiership, with Ransom featuring in the majority of their 19 wins. The clinical winger notched up nine tries during that season, including a contender for Try of the Season in the annual Saint Patrick's Party against Cornish Pirates, a match that also had the Championship season's highest attendance of 11,671.

The firm was the first to develop private place neighborhoods in Ladue, and their work was influential in establishing the architectural character of the city.Bry, Charlene. Ladue Found. Virginia Publishing Company, 2011, p.117. The partners of the firm were Norman B. Comfort and Gunther Meier. Both men were World War I veterans with Major Comfort receiving distinction for his combat service in France.Stevens, Walter Barlow. Centennial History of Missouri Volume II. The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1921, p. 909. While in Europe during the war, the men became interested in the native architecture and particularly with Tudor design. As a result, the firm, who frequently partnered with architect Daniel H. Mullen, favored Tudor Revival designs.http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/85001564.pdf Private place developments Tudor entry into Fair Oaks Estates designed by Daniel H. Mullen In the 19th century, Ladue (then unincorporated and simply known as Township 45) was a primarily agricultural area consisting of farms and modest dwellings. At the turn of the 20th century, several private clubs were built on former farmland such as The Log Cabin Club (1899), The Bogey Club (1902), and the St. Louis Country Club (1914). Wealthy St. Louisans, like Joseph Pulitzer, then built sprawling country estates in Ladue to be near the clubs and to escape the heat and pollution of the city.Bry, Charlene. Ladue Found. Virginia Publishing Company, 2011, p. 62-63. Recognizing the growing prominence of the area in the 1920s, Meier and Comfort bought several tracts of land in the district and subdivided them into private place neighborhoods. Their development plans were unique in that they sought to strike a balance between the urban sense of community, typical of the city's private places, with the aura of landed gentry that was characterizing then-rural Ladue. In order to foster community, their developments were established as resident- governing private places. Additionally, unlike many other real estate developments of the time, all the houses faced inwards (towards each other) with their backyards bordering the surrounding streets. At the time, it was considered preferable to have one's address on a major street due to the better accessibility, but Meier and Comfort envisioned a self-contained community that was inclusive of all the residents, but somewhat exclusive of the outside world. In order to retain a rural atmosphere, they designed lot sizes that were larger than typical (up to two acres). Inspired by the nearby country lanes, their street designs were not lined with curbs, sidewalks, or street lamps as was the practice in neighboring Clayton and St. Louis. Meier and Comfort neighborhoods also tended to avoid flat, grid-patterned street plans and instead favored designs with curved and sloped streets that followed the natural topography of the land. Meier and Comfort was the first real estate firm in the area to build a few \\"spec homes\\" in their subdivisions in addition to selling empty lots on which buyers would build. Their motivation was not as much to profit from the building of the home, but to raise the value of the remaining lots by establishing a precedent of high quality homes in the new neighborhood.Bry, Charlene. Ladue Found. Virginia Publishing Company, 2011, p. 117. The private places created by Meier and Comfort would become the model for the neighborhoods in Ladue to follow and the design choices they made would become characteristic of Ladue's architecture. When the City of Ladue was formally established in 1936, many of the new city's building codes and property ordinances were continuations of the standards set by Meier and Comfort. =List of neighborhoods developed by Meier and Comfort= *Picardy Lane (originally called Exermont), phase 1 - 1924, phase 2 - 1925, phase 3 - 1929 *Fair Oaks Estates, 1924 *Clermont Lane, 1924 *Oakleigh Lane, 1925 *Clermont Park, 1926 *Glen Forest, 1928 *York Village (in neighboring Brentwood) File:16 Picardy.jpg16 Picardy File:4 Fair Oaks.jpg4 Fair Oaks File:28 Clermont.jpg28 Clermont File:4 Oakleigh.jpg4 Oakleigh Seven Gables Building Seven Gables Building The Seven Gables Building at 26 Meramec Avenue in downtown Clayton was developed by Meier and Comfort and designed by their frequent partner Daniel H.

They found Comfort dead, with a bullet wound to his right temple and with a revolver and box of cards on the ground under his leg. The life insurance company considered the event a suicide and denied his widow's claim. After a lawsuit that included the testimony of the party guests, a jury ruled it an accident and that Mrs. Comfort was entitled to the $30,000 policy. In addition to the life insurance policy and company stock, Comfort's estate was valued at a considerable $1,381,000.St. Louis Globe Democrat, May 2, 18, and 29, 1934.

Background Mr Cheong Wang was a Chinese political asylum-seeker and a Buddhist, of the Shaolin Sect. On the he was waiting for a train at Clacton-on-Sea railway station when his bag was stolen. He searched and found a thief with the bag, whom he attempted to \\"detain\\", and from whom he recovered it. From this, he drew a curved martial-arts sword, with a sheath. In the ensuring altercation, or disturbance, the local police was called in, and upon a further search of the bag by the Police a small Ghurkha-style kukri knife was found. For all these, he was indicted on two counts, of having an article with a blade or point in a public place, contrary to Section 139(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Wang was tried in the Crown Court at Chelmsford, also in Essex, before His Honour Judge Pearson, Circuit Judge, with a jury. Upon the , Wang was convicted, upon that Circuit Judge's direction of guilt to the Jury, of the two offences, and he was on the conditionally discharged, for a period of 12 months. Forfeiture orders were also made for the two offending articles. Appeal to the Court of Appeal He appealed against his conviction to the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was heard before Laws LJ, Curtis J and the Recorder of Cardiff. They dismissed the appeal, concluding a judge was entitled to direct the jury to convict provided that 'it is plain beyond sensible argument that the material before the jury could not in law suffice to discharge the burden' necessary to satisfy the defence.Wang, R. v [2003] EWCA Crim 3228 (10 December 2003) Appeal to the House of Lords Wang duly appealed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords. In a unanimous opinion, the appellate committee allowed his appeal and quashed his conviction, concluding that 'there are no circumstances in which a judge is entitled to direct a jury to return a verdict of guilty' because a 'belief that the jury would probably, and rightly, have convicted does not [enable a trial judge to give a direction to convict] ... when there were matters which could and should have been the subject of their consideration'.Wang, R v [2005] UKHL 9 (10 February 2005) Significance The judgment settled the law in England and Wales by providing a clear authority in this topic of uncertainty.P.

Augustines were known for their intense shows and heavy interaction with the audience. Numerous shows saw the band leave the stage to perform on the floor with the fans. History Following the break-up of their former band Pela, McCarthy and Sanderson decided to continue producing the songs that were originally supposed to comprise Pela's second studio album. The album, titled Rise Ye Sunken Ships, was released digitally on June 6, 2011. In September 2016 they announced that their fall tour was to be their last, following the break up of the band. The band derived its name from the month of August. Both McCarthy and Sanderson were born in August, as was McCarthy's brother, James. James' story is one of the major influences behind their first album. Pela also dissolved very quickly (\\"In the span of two weeks\\") in August 2009. Originally, the new band was named Augustines. Since there were other bands with the same name, they changed the name to We Are Augustines. In August 2013, the band announced via YouTube that they would return to using the name Augustines. =Formation and debut album= Material for Augustines' debut album originated when, with Pela, McCarthy wrote dozens of songs and Sanderson contributed many demos of his own. The band had close to 40 songs to pick from. Even though the album was nearly complete, they were unhappy with the results and wanted to re-record the material. \\"We had to do it twice because it just wasn‚Äôt strong,\\" Sanderson said. Throughout the recording (and re- recording) process, the band fought with its record label, its manager and amongst themselves. Soon after, McCarthy learned his brother James had committed suicide. With all the issues surrounding the band, \\"Pela was unable to survive the storm,\\" Sanderson said. After deciding to part ways with the other two members of Pela, McCarthy and Sanderson eventually decided to finish the album. Having been through a terrible experience with the music labels and industry, \\"We knew that we wanted to proceed independently, but actually taking that on was a whole other challenge.\\" With support from the indie music community, specifically John Richards of KEXP, they were able to finish the record. The album was produced by David Newfeld, who is best known for his work with Broken Social Scene. Their first performance of the new material, still under the original name Augustines, was for Richards and KEXP at the Cutting Room Studios on October 18, 2010. They released Rise Ye Sunken Ships independently on June 6, 2011 as a digital-only copy on iTunes. Prior to the release of their first album, the band announced that Rob Allen had joined the band as the full-time drummer. Augustines at the Bowery Ballroom =Rise Ye Sunken Ships (2011)= Rise Ye Sunken Ships was released in CD format in North America, Australia, and New Zealand on August 23, 2011. The album was released worldwide on March 5, 2012. The band then began a UK tour in support of the album in October 2011. The album has been received positively by critics with The Sun and Music Fix naming the first single released in the UK, \\"Book of James\\", their single of the week. The album covers a lot of very difficult subjects, the most prominent of these subjects are the untimely deaths of McCarthy's mother and brother. Rob Allen, the band's drummer, states that while there is a heavy focus on the painful subjects throughout the album the band also has a deep sense of positivity and hope. \\"The songs are about topics that happened over a period of time. They have a lot of meaning to us, especially Bill and that won't change, but, if anything, we are living proof that things can get better, opportunities can come your way and that is worth celebrating! We are jovial, energetic people who want to enjoy life and I think that's what you see when we perform.\\" http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/we-are- augustines/364891-exclusive-we-are-augustines-interview The band traveled extensively in the British Isles and Europe in support of the album, performing at festivals such as Pukkelpop, Reading & Leeds and large venues such as Shepherd's Bush. In 2014, the band toured the U.S. supporting Frightened Rabbit. In June 2011, the music video for \\"Chapel Song\\" won the title of best music video at the Los Angeles Art-House film festival. In March 2012 the band recorded a session at Abbey Road Studios https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPzerhTjTNE The band released the video for the third single to be taken from Rise Ye Sunken Ships, \\"Juarez\\", on April 11, 2012. =Augustines (2014)= In late 2013, the band spent several weeks in the studio of producer Peter Katis (Frightened Rabbit, We Were Promised Jetpacks, J√≥nsi Birgisson) working on their self-titled second album, Augustines. Upon completion of the album (released in early 2014) the band embarked on their first headlining U.S. tour, selling out most shows well in advance. Augustines returned to the UK in early April, and spent a great deal of the summer doing European festivals. After further US dates in the autumn, they returned to Europe. The band finished the year with a triumphant gig in front of 3000 at the London Roundhouse. This was filmed for use in a documentary about the band called Rise. In August 2015, the band completed a UK/Europe tour and began work on their third album. =This Is Your Life and break up (2016)= Augustines released their third album, This Is Your Life on June 10. It was announced on September 6 that their upcoming shows later in the year would be their last due to financial constraints. Augustines played their final show on October 31, 2016 at the O2 Academy in Liverpool. They ended with 'Cruel City', from their second album. The entire show was broadcast via Facebook Live. = Post-Augustines = In 2017, McCarthy released his first solo album, Shelter. Produced by Sanderson, the album featured input from Allen, Pela drummer Tomislav Zovich, and Augustines regular Yannis Panos. Sanderson also released his own solo project in 2017, Audio Journal Vol. 1: Bringing the Past to Light. McCarthy is planning to release his second studio album in 2019.

It requires the subduing of prey, usually completely on the ground and pinned by the predator, and the engulfing of the muzzle of the prey in the mouth of the predator, blocking respiration through either the mouth or nose. Usage It is generally easier for large, social carnivores to use this method with large prey when there are multiple individuals holding the prey still while it suffocates, in the case of the lion, or for solitary carnivores killing weak or small animals. It is not as common as the throat clamp with cats. It is also a calculated measure not seen often because most predators are known, especially canids and hyaenids, for eating the prey while it's still alive and letting it die of loss of blood and/or shock, not bothering with killing it first. This method also silences the prey for the most part and can be used by solitary animals to keep the noise down as not to attract other predators with the commotion. Anatomy Canines that are strong and not too long are generally essential for this method because any rapid movement of the head of the prey can break long or fragile canines and canines that are too short won't penetrate into the muscle and skin of the muzzle far enough and the prey can pull free. The predator cannot breath through its mouth when applying a muzzle clamp and must resort to breathing through the nose, which causes the issue of not enough oxygen if the predator is exhausted since panting through the mouth is much more efficient than breathing through the nose for most predators. If the predator is too tired, it may resort to another method of killing or withhold from finishing the prey off until it catches its breath.

This skull was collected by the South African palaeontologist, James W. Kitching from Hugoskop in the Rouxville District and referred to subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Burgersdorp Formation, Beaufort Group (Karoo Basin). The genus was first named by Sean P. Modesto and Ross J. Damiani in 2003. However, the species was initially assigned to the genus Thelegnathus (now considered to be a nomen dubium) by C.E. Gow in 1977, as the species Thelegnathus perforatus.  Description  Most of the skull is poorly preserved, with the exception of the tooth-bearing elements. Theledectes is the only known parareptile with more than one row of marginal teeth (teeth along the edge of the mouth). The only other reptiles with multiple marginal tooth rows are rhynchosaurs and some captorhinids. The lower jaw has two large incisor-like teeth, akin to Scoloparia. However, the dentition is also distinctly inset from the rest of the face by a large curved area, a trait also known in Hypsognathus. The teeth are large and blunted cones, with circular bases, in contrast to most procolophonids which have teeth that are wider than long. Similar teeth are also observed in \\"Eumetabolodon\\" dongshengensis, a Chinese procolophonid previously considered a species of Eumetabolodon.

The campaign was so important to Mehmed II \\"the Conqueror\\" that he came personally to ensure triumph. After nineteen days of bombarding the castle walls, the Ottomans launched five successive general attacks which all ended in victory for the besieged. With dwindling resources, Mehmed attacked and defeated the smaller surrounding fortresses of ≈Ωabljak Crnojeviƒáa, Drisht, and Lezha, left a siege force to starve Shkodra into surrender, and returned to Constantinople. On January 25, 1479, Venice and Constantinople signed a peace agreement that ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire. The defenders of the citadel emigrated to Venice, whereas many Albanians from the region retreated into the mountains.Shpuza, Gazmend. ‚ÄúLa Lutte pour la d√©fense de Shkod√´r dans ann√©es 1474 et 1478‚Äì1479,‚Äù in Studia Albanica, VI, 1968, pp. 181‚Äì90. Shkodra then became a seat of the newly established Ottoman sanjak, the Sanjak of Scutari. The Ottomans held the city until Montenegro captured it in April 1913, after a six-month siege.  Background  Fatih Sultan Mehmet II went personally to lead the siege Shkodra, also known as Shkod√´r or as Scutari, was both a strategic town and an important region of Albania Veneta. After being held by the Albanian Bal≈°iƒá (Balsha) noble family since 1355, Shkodra was briefly taken by the Ottomans in 1393, retaken by Gjergj II Balshaj in 1395, then ceded (along with the nearby fortresses of Drivast, Dagnum, and ≈†as) to the Republic of Venice in 1405.Prifti, Kristaq, et. al. Historia e popullit shqiptar n√´ kat√´r v√´llime, vol. 1. Tirana: Toena, 2002. Sultan Mehmed II had already conquered Constantinople in 1453, but now desired to dominate the Albanian coastline and be better poised to cross the Adriatic and march upon Rome.Kinross, John Patrick Douglas Balfour. The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire. New York: Harper Perennial, 2002.

The Venetians and the Ottoman Empire had been at war since 1463, the Ottoman Empire seeking expansion and the Venetians seeking to secure their trading colonies. Venice held and was arming a number of Albanian towns, including Shkodra, which it had taken in 1396 and renamed Scutari. By 1466 Venice considered Shkodra the heart and capital of Albania Veneta.Schmitt, Oliver (translated by Ardian Klosi). Arb√´ria Venedike (1392-1479), Tirana: K&B;, 2002. Shkodra was so important to the Empire's aims that, shortly after the siege, Ottoman chronicler Ashik Pashazade called it \\"the hope of passage to the lands of Italy\\".Ashik Pashazade (ca. 1480) cited in Pulaha, Selami. Lufta shqiptaro turke n√´ shekullin XV: burime osmane. Tirana: Universiteti Shtet√´ror i Tiran√´s, 1968. p. 72 The Ottomans attempted to take Shkodra in the siege of 1474. Sultan Mehmed II's commander Suleiman Pasha failed; therefore the Ottomans retreated and the sultan planned a more powerful offensive. Meanwhile, Mehmed II had demanded that Venice surrender Kruja, Shkodra, and other Albanian towns in exchange for peace, and added leverage to this demand by instructing Iskender Bey, the sanjak bey of Bosnia to invade Friuli. Count Carlo da Braccio repulsed the invaders, but before returning to Bosnia, \\"the Turkish bands nevertheless did enormous damage and carried away large numbers of men and cattle.\\" Despite these losses, Venice refused to yield to Mehmed II's demands to surrender Shkodra, being its \\"last bastion in the East\\". In 1477 the Ottomans captured most of the nearby territory of Zeta together with ≈Ωabljak and defeated the main army of Ivan Crnojeviƒá late in 1477 or early 1478. Crnojeviƒá soon recovered ≈Ωabljak but held it only briefly while the Ottomans concentrated on their attack on Shkodra. Among the population of Shkodra there were people who were suspected to be connected to the Ottomans and who supported the surrender of the city.  Forces Involved  The Republic of Venice was intent on defending Shkodra.Nadin, Lucia. Shqiptar√´t n√´ Venedik: M√´rgim e integrim 1479‚Äì1552. Tirana: Sht√´pia Botuese \\"55\\", 2008. Expecting the new Ottoman attack, the Venetians prepared vigorously, sending their expert engineers to reinforce the fortifications according to the most modern techniques and maintaining a garrison of about 800 mercenaries in the city. In late 1477, as the new Ottoman threat grew imminent, many Venetian mercenaries deserted Shkodra. Therefore, the Venetian Senate finally approved the locals' requests for arms and gave permission for the recruitment of warriors from the surrounding villages. The city of Shkodra would be defended by its strong walls and a mixed garrison of locals and the remaining Venetian mercenaries. In the spring of 1478, Mehmed II dispatched both the beylerbey of Rumelia, Koca Davud Pasha, and the new beylerbey of Anatolia, Mustafa Bey, to Shkodra with the armies under their control. In his eyewitness testimony (book), The Siege of Shkodra, Shkodran historian Marin Barleti recorded that there may have been up to 350,000 Ottoman soldiers involved in the attack. Ottoman chronicler Kivami wrote of 100,000 Ottoman soldiers in one attack alone.Pulaha, Selami (ed.). Lufta shqiptaro-turke n√´ shekullin XV. Burime osmane. Tiran√´: Universiteti Shtet√´ror i Tiran√´s, Instituti i Historis√´ dhe Gjuh√´sis√´, 1968 Venice wanted to aid the besieged and sent their galleys up the Bojana River from the Adriatic Sea, but they were prevented by an Ottoman blockade at Shirgj. When the Ottomans approached Shkodra in May 1478, Venetian commander Antonio da L√©zze sent the women and children to the seaside villages,Barleti, Marin. Rrethimi i Shkodr√´s. Tiran√´: Instituti i Historis√´, 1967, but some women stayed behind to help the men. Approximately 2,000 people defended the castle from within, whereas hundreds of Albanian men and youths from the region helped from without, making guerilla attacks on the Ottoman tent camps. Forces of Ivan Crnojeviƒá, with Ragusan support, sailed over the lake and attacked Ottoman tents at night. Other notable figures in the defense of Shkodra were Friar Bartholomew of Epirus, who had fought alongside Scanderbeg before taking holy orders and gave rousing speeches to rally the defenders, and Nicholas Moneta.  Rozafa Fortress and the Siege  Venetian gate (outer), barbican, and original Illyrian gate (inner) at the northern face of the fortressThe Rozafa Fortress was the focal point of the siege, the natural position and architectural reinforcements of which allowed the vastly outnumbered garrison to withstand bombardment and successive ground attacks by the besiegers. The castle (as it is sometimes called) was considered the central leg of a trivet (or tripod) including Zabljak, Drisht, and Lezh√´.Kivami (Ottoman Chronicler, ca. 1426‚Äì1491), cited in Pulaha, Selami (ed.).

Tiran√´: Universiteti Shtet√´ror i Tiran√´s, Instituti i Historis√´ dhe Gjuh√´sis√´, 1968 The city of Shkodra had been burned and rampaged by the Turks in 1467, so from that time the citizens had moved into the fortress for greater security.Kamsi, Vili. \\"Shtrirja e qytetit t√´ Shkodr√´s n√´ koh√´n e lasht√´ dhe t√´ mesme\\" in Monumentet: materialet e sesionit III t√´ institutit t√´ monumenteve t√´ kultur√´s, 11. Tirana: Instituti i Monumenteve t√´ Kultur√´s, 1967. p. 122. The fortress was a natural bastion above Lake Shkodra, three rivers (Bojana, Drin, and Kir), and the Adriatic Sea; it was esteemed to have been \\"a kind of Thermopylae where the high mountains narrowed the passage between the lake and the sea\\".Ceka, Neritan. The Illyrians to the Albanians in the Dawn of Albanian History. Tiran√´: Migjeni, 2006 All faces of the fortress mount were recorded as being steep, but the northern face was least steep and more easily climbed. Ottoman chroniclers reported the difficulties of ascending the fortress mount.Tursun (ca. 1426-1491), text cited in Pulaha, Selami. Lufta shqiptaro- turke n√´ shekullin XV. Burime Osmane. Tirana: Universiteti Shtet√´ror, 1962, p. 105. Foreseeing siege warfare, in 1458, Venetian architects Andrea and Francesco Venier and Malchiore da Imola drew plans for the citadel's reinforcements and a cistern system designed to collect rain water.Kamsi, Vili. ‚ÄúK√´shtjella e Shkodr√´s dhe Restaurimi i Saj‚Äù in Monumentet, 1 (ed. Gani Strazimiri). Tiran√´: Ministria e Arsimit dhe e Kultur√´s, 1971 Additionally, the Venetians added a barbican and extra gate to reinforce what they (correctly) forecast to be the main point of conflict. In the failed Ottoman siege of 1474, the outer walls were damaged significantly. According to Barleti's firsthand account, the citizens rebuilt the walls, but when they sensed that the Ottomans were approaching again with an even stronger attack, they constructed secondary fortifications and redoubts made of wood and earth.Barleti, Marin (trans. Henrik Lacaj). Rrethimi i Shkodr√´s. Tirana: Instituti i Historis√´, 1967.  The Siege  A relief commemorating the siege from the 15th century School of the Albanians in Venice In the Spring of 1478, Mehmed II sent out advance scouts and then his commanders to march on Shkodra, inducing panic across the countryside. On May 14, the first soldiers arrived in Shkodra: 8,000 Ottoman akinci led by Ali Bey, 4,000 horsemen led by Iskender Bey, and 3,000 horsemen led by Malkoch (Malko√ßoƒülu). The citizens intensified their work to fortify the citadel, adding secondary defenses in anticipation of seeing the outer walls demolished by the Ottoman cannonade. The Ottomans set fire to surrounding villages and many citizens of the Shkodra region fled to safer haven. Five days later, the pasha of Rumelia, Davud Pasha, arrived and set up camp on the hill due north of the castle, known as \\"Pasha‚Äôs Hill,\\" where much of the Ottoman cannonade would be positioned (at approximately the same altitude as the fortress). The defenders were stationed on all sides but concentrated their resources on the main gate area where the Ottomans focused their attack. Around June 5, Davud Pasha climbed St. Mark's Mountain (today's Mt. Tarabosh, opposite the castle to the west) to survey the positions and strategize. Several days later, the pasha of Anatolia (Mustafa Bey) arrived bringing approximately 46,000 cavalry. On June 15, about 5,000 of the sultan's janissaries came to prepare for Mehmed II's arrival on July 1. Mehmed was in Kruja to conclude a year-long siege. Those in Kruja, dying of hunger, were given the choice of staying and submitting to Ottoman rule or withdrawing safely with their possessions. They chose the latter, but instead were \\"mercilessly beheaded\\". By June 16, 1478, Kruja was finally under Ottoman control. Ottoman soldiers continued to flow into Shkodra throughout the latter half of June. Around June 18, a small delegation of Ottoman leaders demanded the Shkodrans surrender, offering peace and rewards if they chose to comply and threatening torture and execution if they chose to resist. On behalf of all the Shkodrans, Peter Pagnanus refused the offer with threats of his own. On June 22, the first two Ottoman cannons were installed and began to fire on the city. By July 11, eleven cannons were being employed, as well as two mortars whose projectiles exploded upon impact. Babinger records artillery of enormous caliber and \\"incendiary rockets, balls of rags impregnated with wax, sulfur, oil, and other inflammable materials\\" being \\"used for the first time\\". The besieged also had cannons of their own. The Shkodran priest Marin Barleti recorded a daily tally of incoming cannon fire, with the total reaching over 3,200 shots. Von Hammer gives a figure of 2,534 total shots.Von Hammer, Joseph. Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches, Grossentheils aus bisher unben√ºtzten, Handschriften und Archiven. Pest: C.A. Hartlenben‚Äôs Verlage, 1828. On July 11, the sultan launched the first of five ground attacks. The climb proved difficult for the Ottoman soldiers, who were repulsed in every attack. On July 27, the Ottomans launched their fifth and final assault. Shkodran Jacob Moneta roused his ailing troops with a thrilling speech. The sultan climbed Pasha's Hill to observe the battle. Determined to triumph, the sultan ordered heavy artillery fire simultaneous to the ground assault, resulting in at least three instances of devastating \\"friendly fire\\" upon the Ottomans. Incredibly, the Shkodran garrison held yet again. Barleti records that the arrows fired by the Ottoman archers were so copious that the Shkodrans used them for kindling to start fires‚Äîand needed no other kindling for an entire month. The Venetian historian Sabellicus reported anecdotal accounts from eyewitnesses inside the castle, such as: \\"a miserable cat, scared from her hiding place by the war-cries, fell pierced by eleven [arrow] shafts at once\\" On July 30, the sultan gathered his general council desiring to plan a sixth ground attack, but was persuaded to halt attacks on the Shkodrans who, according to Ottoman historian Kivami, were fighting \\"like tigers on the mountaintops\\". The sultan accepted this counsel at the end of August and ordered his commanders to attack the smaller fortresses nearby who were aiding Shkodra. ≈Ωabljak, \\"where Ivan Crnojevic (1465‚Äì1490), 'lord of the Zeta,' had established his court, surrendered to the governor of Rumelia almost without a blow (not by Crnojeviƒá but by his cousin and small number of men). Drisht, however, ... resisted bravely,\\" but the Ottomans captured it easily on 1 September 1478, using their artillery. 300 captives from Drisht were taken to Shkodra and executed in the sight of the besieged. Then the Ottomans marched on Lezh√´ but found it nearly completely abandoned; on the Drin River they captured two Venetian galleys with 200 sailors, who were taken near the walls of Shkodra and killed in front of the people of Shkodra. Mehmed II ordered bridges to be built on the Bojana River to prevent Venetian ships from coming to Shkodra's aid via the Adriatic Sea. He ordered a siege force to remain in Shkodra‚Äîled by Gedik Ahmet Pasha and said to have contained between 10,000 and 40,000 soldiers‚Äîto starve the city into surrender. Then, \\"disappointed at the outcome of his Albanian campaign, Mehmed started the return journey\\" to Constantinople, \\"with 40,000 men\\".  Conclusion  In November 1478, as the siege wore on and as the besieged had resorted to eating mice and rats, Antonio Da L√©zze (the proveditore of the city) continued to appeal for help to the Signoria of Venice, which decided to send forces to lift the siege; four days later, however, the decision was reversed. On January 25, 1479,Pitcher, Donald Edward. An historical geography of the Ottoman empire from earliest times to the end of the sixteenth century. Leiden, Brill, 1972, [1973]. the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Constantinople which ceded Shkodra to Mehmed II on the condition that the citizens be spared. Venice did not include its ally Ivan Crnojeviƒá in this peace treaty; therefore Crnojeviƒá was forced to leave Zeta and find a haven in Italy. The treaty was ratified in Venice on April 25, 1479. The Shkodrans in the castle had to choose between emigrating to Venice or dwelling under the rule of their enemies. Marin Barleti records that every citizen chose emigration. Babinger records that, after the 1479 peace treaty, the old Albanian families \\"such as the Arianiti, the Dukagjins, the Castriotas, the Musachi, and the Topias were obliged to take refuge in Naples, Venice, or northern Italy\\". Many Albanians, however, did remain in their fatherland. Some espoused Islam and some retreated deeper into the mountains and organized occasional uprisings, maintaining a \\"rigorous resistance\\" against the Ottomans until well into the seventeenth century.Pulaha, Selami, ed. Defteri i regjistrimit t√´ Sanxhakut t√´ Shkodr√´s i vitit 1485. Tirana: Akademia e Shkencave e R. P. t√´ Shqip√´ris√´, Instituti i Historis√´, 1974. pp. 3, 8. Both the besieged and the besiegers acknowledged both victory and loss. The Shkodran garrison indeed withstood the military assault, but they eventually lost and left the city; whereas the Ottomans indeed gained the city, but only after failing to conquer it by military force and sustaining significant casualties.  Casualties  Franz Babinger claims that the Ottomans lost \\"12,000 of their best troops\\" on the attack of July 22 alone, then describes a further one-third of the Ottoman army being lost on July 27; the Shkodran garrison is said to have lost 400 on July 22. Ottoman historian Kemal Pashazade (1468‚Äì1534) recorded that \\"hundreds of the infidels and Muslims died each day and hundreds more escaped with wounded heads ‚Ä¶ swollen with lumps and craters like the surface of the moon.\\" Another Ottoman historian, Tursun (ca. 1426‚Äì1491), recorded \\"A great war unfolded and an unmerciful bloodshed that had never before been seen in history\\". Marin Barleti recorded thousands of Ottoman casualties and hundreds of Shkodran casualties. Albanian historian Aleks Buda, in his analysis of Venetian chronicles of the event, concludes that of the approximately 1,600 Shkodran men and women who fought in the citadel, approximately 450 men and 150 women survived.  Significance  After the fall of Shkodra in 1479, the Ottomans effectively controlled the entire territory of Albania and could focus on advancing to Italy. Ottoman chronicler Ashik Pashazade (ca. 1400‚Äì1481) claimed \\"Shkodra has been conquered, a fortress near land and sea ... the hope of passage to Italy!\\" Indeed, the Ottomans would pass on to Italy in July, 1480, at the invasion of Otranto. So important was Albania to the Otranto invasion that Gedik Ahmet Pasha (the Ottoman army and navy commander) utilized it as a supply station and place of quick retreat. Goffman records a 1548 battle off the coast of Pr√©veza in which an inferior Ottoman fleet led by Barbarossa routed Andrea Doria‚Äôs Catholic galleys largely because of the fresh reinforcements coming from the Ottoman-controlled Albanian shores. Thirty-six of Doria‚Äôs vessels were captured, whereas Barbarossa lost none.Goffman, Daniel. The Ottoman Empire and Early Modern Europe. Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 148 In Shkodra and other parts of northern Albania, the Ottomans transformed churches into mosques and promoted conversion to Islam. According to the Albanologist Robert Elsie, an estimated thirty to fifty percent of the population of northern Albania eventually converted by the early seventeenth century. They \\"converted ‚Ä¶ mainly not for theological reasons, but primarily to have the right to bear weapons, to have access in the Ottoman state high ranks, to make career in the military and to avoid higher taxes\\". Franciscan missionary activity helped to stem this tide; nevertheless, conversions \\"continued unabated throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\\".Elsie, Robert. A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology and Folk Culture. London: Hurst & Company, 2001, pp. 51‚Äì52 According to Albanian historian and Osmanolog Dritan Egro many high ranking Ottoman Albanians would push other Albanian to convert in Islam in order to fill Ottoman ranks and create an Albanian pyramid of power inside the Empire. It is not a confidence that the 2 Pashas that were send to take Shkodra, Ghedik Pasha and Davut Pasha were both Albanian. Shkodra became an administrative and military center known as a sanjak and it was one of the main Ottoman cities in the Balkans. The city became famous for its artisan weapon manufacturing by the locals for the Albanian mercenaries to use in battle or show as a sign of power. In between 1750s to 1830s the city was the centre of the semi indepdent Pashalluk of Shkodra lead by the powerful Albanian Bushati family who would expand its power in large areas of western Balkans. In 1867 it merged with the sanjak of Skopje to form the Vilayet of Shkodra. In 1912, Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire, procuring the favor of the London Conference of Ambassadors.  Art and Literature  Veronese's Siege of Scutari depicting a noblewoman being taken captive The siege of Shkodra is depicted in several works of European literature and art. The fa√ßade of the former School of the Albanians in Venice contains a relief:File:Venezia - Ex Scola degli albanesi (sec.

New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1988 The Latin inscription means: ‚ÄúThe people of Shkodra put up this everlasting monument of their outstanding loyalty toward the Republic of Venice and of the Venetian Senate‚Äôs extraordinary beneficence.‚Äù In 1503, Marin Becikemi wrote and published a panegyric about the siege, in praise of the Republic of Venice. In 1504, Marin Barleti's The Siege of Shkodra (De obsidione Scodrensi) was published in Venice. It is a firsthand account the siege presented to the Venetian Senate. It was republished several times and translated into other European languages in the sixteenth century (and later into Albanian and English). In 2018 Venetian scholar Lucia Nadin discovered a manuscript of Marin Barleti, dated ca. 1500, presumed to be the original manuscript of De obsidione Scodrensi (scholars have begun to study this manuscript). In 1585, Paolo Veronese painted The Siege of Scutari, oil on canvas, which is located on the ceiling of the Doge's Palace in Venice. In 1860, Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri depicted the great battle of July 27 with an etching entitled I Turchi respinti da Scutari.  Citations  References  Primary Sources * Barletius, Marinus.

It involves the predator grasping the throat of the prey and clamping tight so that the windpipe is either crushed or blocked. Cats use this to kill prey while dogs and hyenas use this to weaken the prey before eating it, generally alive. It's more often used than the muzzle clamp and is generally safer, though slower. It is usually and most effective when positioned as near to the mandible as the carnivore can get. Between the larynx and the jaw, the windpipe is surrounded with less cartilage and is more malleable, while lower down, near the chest, the passageway would be increasingly harder to collapse, so the throat clamp is usually positioned high up on the animal's neck. Usage If the prey is on the ground and pinned, most predators position themselves behind the animal to use their body's weight to help control the movements of the prey and reach around to grab the throat, usually twisting the head around, aiding in both their grasp and the blocking of the windpipe. If the prey is standing, a solitary predator can use a throat clamp usually only if the prey is small or in shock. A strong, large animal can easily kick and injure the predator from this angle. A social predator can use the standing throat clamp much more easily because there can be other individuals on the back of the prey, stopping it from kicking, which could lead to collapse, or using a throat clamp periodically to tire the animal out. This latter method usually involves large, patient carnivores such as the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). They surround the prey in relatively large numbers, individuals taking turns to jump in and grab the prey by the flanks to try and pull it down, while the prey forcing them off grows exhausted, and in the meantime, more experienced individuals secure a throat clamp on the distracted animal and hold on as long as possible to the struggling prey. The temporary throat clamp can make the prey dizzy and uncoordinated and even force it to go into shock if the chase and attack wasn't enough, aiding in the predator's attempts to pull it to the ground. Agile predators such a lions have been observed to perch on the upper back and neck of large cape buffalo and wrap around to secure a partial throat clamp. Anatomy Strong canines are generally required for this move: canines that are too short won't penetrate deeply enough and struggling prey can tear free, while canines that are too long or weak can be broken in the struggle with large prey. This fact created a controversy that is still generally unresolved as to the killing tactics of the extinct carnivores machairodonts, or sabre- toothed cats. Strong jaws are often needed to compress the windpipe far enough. Most often, the canines pierce the prey behind the windpipe so that it is not torn, but compressed between premolars of upper and lower jaws. It can be compared to the bit of a horse's bridal in placement. With the mouth completely enclosing the windpipe, it is, if the predator does not relax its grip, very difficult to break free from. Alternative forms Occasionally, and as suggested for the killing method of machairodonts, the canines actually pierce the windpipe and the surrounding blood vessels so that the tear in arteries and adjacent windpipe lead to a flow of blood into the windpipe and down into the lungs where the animal essentially drowns in its own blood. This method has not been used regularly by any modern carnivores and is, due to the bloody nature, not suitable for an area with high competition due to the smell attracting other predators. It can be argued that this not a true throat clamp, but another specialized type of killing.

It aims to provide US citizens with tools and training for effecting political change in their community. The group was founded by Harry and Caroline Pozycki in 1998, and draws support from experts in law, government, and politics including former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gary Stein, Dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania Michael Delli Carpini, and former Counsels to Governor Tom Kean and Brendan Byrne, among others. Structure The Citizens Campaign has a full-time staff of 10, and more than 300 volunteer government and political experts who compose the Law and Policy Task Force, the Academy for Citizen Empowerment, and the New Jersey Hyperlocal News Association. =Law and Policy Task Force= The Law and Policy Task Force, chaired by Former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gary Stein, is a volunteer network of legal and governmental experts who develop model legislation and cost-cutting proposals for local and state adoption. The Task Force is composed of about 50 New Jersey lawyers who work to develop model laws pertaining to expanding citizen rights and eliminating government waste, including competitive insurance purchasing, pay-to-play reform, increasing access to public records, and political party committee transparency. Currently, over 200 New Jersey municipalities have adopted and implemented a Citizens Campaign model ordinance. =Academy for Citizen Empowerment= The Academy for Citizen Empowerment, or ACE, is the educational arm of The Citizens Campaign, chaired by Michael Delli Carpini. Its focus is adult leadership training. The Academy has developed a series of free classes on citizen engagement both online and live at several locations in New Jersey.

The Hyperlocal News Association has bi-monthly meetings with the aim of helping reporters, citizen journalists, and bloggers to learn about different aspects of covering local news and government. These meetings often include speakers or panels on important issues such as municipal budgets, political reform, and government transparency. The association also provides:The Citizens Campaign.

PatersonPress.com was recognized by the New Jersey Society of Professional Journalists with two first place awards for \\"Best Online Independent News Organization\\" and \\"Best Online Public Service\\". Joe Malinconico, editor of PatersonPress.com, was recognized for his coverage of Paterson's municipal budget process. Power Centers and Paths to Power The Citizens Campaign defines what it calls the four major \\"power centers\\" of government: elected council or committee, the school board, the planning board, and local political parties and has identified the 5 paths to power for citizens in the community. These positions do not require a person to run for office or spend money, but still give regular citizens the power to make important decisions that will affect the community. In The Citizens Manual, Harry Pozycki outlines these four power centers and aims to describe ways for regular citizens to influence each. The group also defines what it calls five main \\"paths to power\\" for citizens: *\\"Citizen legislators\\", defined as citizens who have the know-how to effectively initiate and gain the adoption of constructive proposals, whether in the form of a new law, new policy or other positive change *\\"Citizen journalists\\", citizens who report on what is happening in the community *\\"Political party committee people\\", neighborhood- level representatives for each of the political parties *\\"Local government appointees\\", citizens appointed to posts on local, county and state boards and commissions who carry influence on policy making and quality-of-life issues *\\"Political navigators\\", defined as people who launch a \\"Call to Service\\" for their community, church, non-profit group, or school with the support of The Citizens Campaign Current projects =Pay to Play Reform= According to the chairman of The Citizens Campaign, Harry Pozycki, \\"pay-to-play is costing county and local governments throughout New Jersey hundreds of millions of dollars in higher fees for professionals and in unnecessary government contracts‚Äîcosts that are passed on to New Jersey's property taxpayers.Riscalla, Louise.

The ordinances, mostly proposed and adopted in towns, have met some opposition. At a Gloucester Township council meeting, the activist group South Jersey Citizens tried to enact pay to play reform, only to be met with stiff resistance from the local council. The local officials argued that this sort of legislation should be dealt with in the New Jersey State Legislature, rather than in each of the 566 municipalities of New Jersey. Unfortunately, SJC recognized, the New Jersey state legislature will not enact the much needed reforms at a state level and the individual local governing bodies are left to pass their own ordinances. As of May 2011, nearly 100 towns have adopted the ordinance already.McCullen, Sean. Council to Hear Out Pay-to- Play Proponents in June Gloucester Patch accessed June 24th, 2011 Additionally, Pozycki believes that adoption of the ordinance in local government will help build momentum for a state reform package Ung, Elisa. Group aims to get pay-to-play out of redevelopment The Inquirer accessed June 24th, 2011. The model pay-to-play reform legislation limits business entities seeking and performing certain government contracts from making political contributions to local campaign committees, municipal and county party committees, and certain political action committees (PACs). =Best price insurance contracting= In many municipalities of New Jersey, the municipality and school district pick a \\"broker of record\\" to solicit insurance company coverage quotes. These brokers are not paid by the municipality or school district, nor do they work for the governing body, but rather are paid a commission by the insurance company hired. The broker is paid based on a percentage of the cost of the overall package chosen. The Citizens Campaign drafted a model resolution to make this process more competitive and transparent.Pozycki, Harry. Best Price Insurance Contracting, \\"The Alternative Press\\", April 29th, 2011, accessed June 23rd, 2011.The Citizens Campaign. Best Price Insurance Contracting Presentation Kit, accessed June 23rd, 2011. The resolution proposes several methods to remedy the current system: *Provide incentives to brokers to work for the municipality's interest rather than the insurance company's *Require brokers to be hired by the town or school district on a competitive, flat-fee basis *Require towns and school districts to get multiple quotes, including bids from the State Health Benefits Plan and Joint Insurance Funds In 2011 this legislation resulted in: *$261,000 saved in brokers fees for Perth Amboy Taylor, Heather.

The Act requires that each county political party have a constitution and bylaws which must be made available both on their website and their county board of election's website. The Act also requires that county political party committees use secret ballots when filling county and state legislative vacancies.

The legislation had bipartisan sponsorship: Senator Jim Whelan, Senator Bill Baroni, Assemblyman John McKeon, and Assemblyman Joseph Malone.

The company manages 130 Warehouse and Distribution Center operations in North America region with a total of 35 million square feet of warehouse space under its management. FedEx Supply Chain was recognized by Multichannel Merchant as a Top 3PL for 2018. History =Early History= Logo of GENCO prior to being branded as FedEx Supply Chain In 1898, Hyman Shear began operating a drayage company known as H. Shear Trucking Company. Leading a blind horse with a wagon, Hyman delivered commodities to Pittsburgh and its surrounding communities. In 1917, H. Shear Trucking purchased its first gas- powered truck allowing the company to expand its delivery area. Within a short period of time, the company was operating seven trucks. Shear's son Sam enrolled in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, at his father's urging. After graduating in 1930 Sam moved with his wife to Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood and bought a pharmacy. After nine years of running the Pharmacy, he joined his father's trucking business. Under Sam's leadership, the company's delivery fleet grew and warehousing and distribution services were added. =1960s-80s= By 1966, Shear Trucking Company employed over 20 drivers and was servicing customers such as Copperweld Steel, Mattel Toys, Kimberly-Clark, Kaufmann's and Gimbel's Department Store. In 1971, Herb Shear - Sam's son - the third generation of the family, joined his father and expanded the company's base of operations to include public warehouse operations. The company was awarded the contract to provide the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board distribution services to Western Pennsylvania in 1975 and in 1988, Distribution Resources Inc. (DRI) was formed in Eastern Pennsylvania to provide customers with flexible labor-intense services including light product assembly, refurbishing, manipulation, and general distribution services. Scanning Solutions, Inc., a division dedicated to the development of returns processing software and reclamation center management, was formed in the late ‚Äò80s. The company offered retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers with flexible, centralized returned goods processing and asset recovery services. Herb also pioneered a new software platform known as R-Log to manage Reverse logistics. GENCO became an industry leader in reverse logistics and liquidation services. =1990s-2015= 1995 saw the consolidation of numerous company divisions and services under one banner name, \\"GENCO Distribution System\\". Along with the new name, came new concepts and developments in supply chain management. 1997 brought about new faces and services through the acquisition of Alpha & Omega; an established Pittsburgh-based warehouse management system (WMS) software development company. GENCO ended the past century positioning itself with a broader range of services through the 1999 acquisition of two companies, Cumberland Distribution Services, building upon the company's base and history of distribution center management services; and Materials for Today's Learning / Joint Ventures, in the fulfillment industry. It also acquired IOgistics in 2003 and Capital Returns in 2005. In 2010 GENCO acquired publicly held Downers Grove, Illinois based ATC Technology Corp. The deal was valued at $512.6 million. After the acquisition the combined company came to be known as GENCO ATC. Through the acquisition of GENCO ATC by FedEx in 2015, FedEx Supply Chain was formed. FedEx acquired the company for $1.4 billion. FedEx Supply Chain The company serves multiple industries and is a leader in non-asset-based transportation, warehousing and distribution, and value-added services. It also works with reverse logistics processes, including returns, recommerce and recycling. The company processes 358 million returns annually and more than 500K direct-to-consumer shipments daily.

It can be reached by a 50-minute hike from the refuge near the Lagunas Jimbura entrance (near the town of Jimbura, in the Espindola Municipality). From the lake, the highest peak in Loja can be reached (though there is no trail). * \\"Laguna Yacur√≠\\", the largest lake in the park and the park's namesake. It can be reached by a five-hour hike. The trail leaves from along the road from Espindola towards the park. * Inca Trail: The Inca Trail also passes through the park and there are archeological ruins including petroglyphs, plazas and cemeteries on the western side of the Protected Forest (which is the North side of the park).

Collections of \\"eight views\\" is a common trope in Chinese travel literature. Song dynasty The Eight Sights of Guangzhou in the Song dynasty were recorded in the Annals of Nanhai County () of the Kangxi Era and the Annals of Guangzhou Prefecture () of the Qianlong Era. Most of the sights were closely related to water bodies in the city, reflecting its tight cultural connection to water. * Fuxu Yuri () referred to Yuri Pavilion in Fuxu Town, located in present-day Miaotou Village, Nangang Town to the east of Nanhai Temple. Yuri Pavilion used to overlook the Pearl River. At dawn, the sun could be seen rising amidst the waves of the river. The pavilion has survived till the modern days, but the riverside has retreated by hundreds of metres. Trees and buildings standing on the alluvial land now completely blocks the view of the river from the pavilion. * Shimen Fanzhao () was located at the intersection of a tributary of the Bei River with Liuxi River in present-day Shimen Village, Jianggao Town in Baiyun District. The surrounding mountains were reflected upon the river. The sun at dawn and dusk would add to the splendor of the sight. Occasionally, mirages could be seen above the water. Legend had it that the view of Shaozhou of hundreds of li away had been seen in a mirage. * Haishan Xiaoji () referred to Haishan Building. Located in present-day Beijing Lu, Haishan Building had an immediate view of the Pearl River thanks to the width of the river at its time. The sight disappeared in the Yuan dynasty as the building caught fire and collapsed. * Zhujiang Qiuse () was found near the intersection of present-day Yanjiang Xilu and Xindi 1 Henglu. In the Song dynasty, this segment of the Pearl River running through Guangzhou was still as wide as one kilometre. A round reef, Haizhu Reef, lay in the middle of the river. Tides would submerge and expose the reef every day. The river has since narrowed over the course of time. Haizhu Reef became buried underground inland in the 1930s. * Juhu Yunying () referred to Juhu Lake, a reservoir constructed by Lu Gou, Prefectural Governor of Guangzhou and Military Commissioner of Lingnan in 836 CE. The reservoir was decorated with pavilions and pagodas; cotton trees and erythrinas were planted along the blanks. It became a popular scenic spot for spring-time excursions of local residents. During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the Southern Han dynasty established an imperial palace at the reservoir. The reservoir silted and dried up in the Yuan dynasty. Present-day Xiaobei Lu runs by the southeast of Yuexiu Mountain through the place where the reservoir was located. * Pujian Lianquan () was a creek on Baiyun Mountain. The name \\"Pujian\\" came from the calami growing in the creek. Creek water fell off a tall cliff and was blown into countless droplets by the mountain breeze. When it rained, the falling droplets became a waterfall, then a spring emerged and was called Lianquan Spring. The present-day Pujian Creek has changed its course, and calami are no longer found in it. The remains of the waterfall of Lianquan Spring can be found at the north end of Lianquan Lu. * Guangxiao Puti () referred to Guangxiao Temple. In 676, a revered monk named Zhiyao planted a pipal in the temple. The tree lived for more than years until it was brought down by a typhoon in 1800. In 1802, a new tree was planted and was a descendant of the older tree, which can be found in the temple today. * Datong Yanyu () referred to Datong Temple and Yanyu Well in the temple. Yanyu Well was said to be capable of forecasting weather. When rain was about to fall, fog would rise from the well. The temple was reduced to debris during the occupation of Guangzhou by Japanese forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Located in Fangcun by the mouth of Huadi River, only several street names were left of the temple, and only one of those streets is still found today. Yuan dynasty The Eight Sights of Guangzhou in the Yuan dynasty retained four sights of those in the Song dynasty while adding four new ones. The four sights from the Song dynasty were all water-related; meanwhile, the four new ones were all mountain sights. All eight sights were found outside the city walls. * Fuxu Yuri * Shimen Fanzhao * Datong Yanyu * Pujian Lianquan * Baiyun Wanwang () referred to the view of the city of Guangzhou at dusk from Baiyun Temple on Baiyun Mountain. Baiyun Temple was located on the south side of Baiyun Mountain. In the Yuan dynasty, the city boundaries were still quite far away from Baiyun Mountain. Therefore, at Baiyun Temple, the view of the entire city could be seen and was particularly splendid at dusk. The location of the sight has now become a popular spot for moon sighting on the night of the Mid- Autumn Festival. * Jingtai Senggui () referred to Jingtai Temple on the north side of Baiyun Mountain. It was established by a famous monk named Jingtai in the Datong era of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty. The temple had since gradually become a popular tourist attraction. The sight was destroyed in the early Qing dynasty when the rebel armies of Shang Kexi and Geng Zhongming logged trees in the area for building cannons during their invasion of Guangzhou. * Yuetai Qiuse () referred to Yuexiu Mountain. Yuewang Platform was the earliest recreational spot in Guangzhou. Built during the Western Han dynasty, only the pedestal was left to be found in the Tang dynasty. The sight was then known for its natural landscape. * Lingzhou Aofu () referred to Mount Lingzhou located in present-day Guanyao Town, Nanhai District, Foshan to the northwest of Guangzhou. In the Yuan dynasty, the nearby Xinan and Lubao Streams had not silted. The mount was surrounded by vast water in all directions. Passengers travelling by the mount would climb it for a sightseeing trip of the mount itself as well as the Xi and Bei Rivers. The sight declined over the last 300 years as the surrounding water narrowed and transportation became inconvenient. Ming dynasty The Eight Sights of Guangzhou of the Ming dynasty were recorded in Transcripts of Ancient Manuscripts on Yangcheng (), which quoted Annals of Ming () as well as Continued Annals of Nanhai County (), compiled in 1910. The list of this era saw a radical departure from that of the Song dynasty. As the city boundaries expanded, only sights located in the urban areas were selected. * Yuexiu Songtao () referred to Yuexiu Mountain. * Suishi Dongtian () was a red sandstone hillock. It had been an islet located in shallow seawater and developed numerous potholes due to corrosion. Two such potholes found on a big rock resembled the shape of a footprint and were believed to be trace left by an immortal, earning the rock a name \\"Xianren Muji\\" (). The scene is now part of Wuxian Temple. What used to be by the seaside during the Jin dynasty is now a few kilometres inland from the north shore of the Pearl River. * Panshan Yunqi () is now just an inconspicuous mound inside Sun Yat-sen Literature Library on Wende Lu. During its glorious days, the ancient Wen Creek flowed to its east. In the wet days, evaporated creek water would create a mist in the shade of pines and cotton trees. However, Wen Creek was rerouted away in 1467 to connect with Donghao Stream. With the loss of its water source, the scene gradually disappeared in the mid-late Ming dynasty. * Yaozhou Chunxiao () was an artificial islet in Xi Lake, a lake built from excavating a natural pool during the Southern Han dynasty. \\"Yaozhou\\" literally means \\"medicine islet\\". It was the place where Southern Han emperor Liu Yan gathered alchemists to produce medicine. Medicine was dumped into the water, dying the water into a unique scenery. Xi Lake was filled with earth after the Chenghua era in the Ming dynasty. Today, a garden on Jiaoyu Lu named Site of Yaozhou () encloses the remains of the sight. * Qilin Sujing () referred to Xuanmiao Temple, which was known for its gardening in the Ming dynasty. In local legends, trees inside were planted by immortals. There was also a well which was said to be drilled by Su Shi. Thus the sight was named. The site of Xuanmiao Temple has since become a densely populated urban area. No trace of the sight can be found today. * Zhujiang Qinglan () was the same sight as Zhujiang Qiuse of the Song dynasty. * Xiangshan Qiaoge () * Liwan Yuchang () Qing dynasty Eight Views of the Ram City were chosen through public appraisal twice in the Qing dynasty. The first election was in the Qianlong era and the second was from the Tongzhi era to the Guangxu era. =Qianlong era= Quoted from Yangcheng Guchao (). * Wuxian Xiadong (): Temple of the Five Immortals * Pazhou Dizhu (): Pazhou Pagoda * Guwu Yushan (): Academy on Yushan Mountain * Zhenhai Cenglou (): Zhenhai Tower * Fuqiu Danjing (): Fuqiu Reef * Xiqiao Yunfu (): Xiqiao Mountain * Donghai Yuzhu (): Yuzhu Reef * Yuexiu Lianfeng (): Yuexiu Mountain =Tongzhi and Guangxu eras= Quoted from Yuedong Biji (). * Shimen Fanzhao (): Shimen and Small Beijiang River * Boluo Yuri () or Fuxu Yuri (): Temple of Nanhai God, alternatively called Pineapple Temple. * Zhujiang Yeyue () or Haizhu Yeyue (): Pearl River * Jinshan Gusi (): Lingzhou and Small Jinshan Mountain Temple * Datong Yanyu (): Datong Temple and Yanyu Well * Baiyun Wanwang (): Baiyun Temple * Pujian Lianquan (): Changpu Creek * Jingtai Senggui (): Jingtai Temple 1963 * Baiyun Songtao (): Baiyun Mountain, Moxing Peak and Mingzhu Pagoda * Luogang Xiangxue (): Luogang Xiangxue Park, Luofeng Temple * Yuexiu Yuantiao (): Yuexiu Mountain, Zhenhai Tower, Sun Yat- sen Memorial Monument * Zhuhai Danxin (): Haizhu Square and its nearby scenic spots centering about Guangzhou Liberation Monument * Hongling Xuri (): Memorial Mausoleum to the Martyrs in Guangzhou Uprising, or Martyrs' Park as more commonly known * Shuangqiao Yanyu (): Zhujiang Bridge * E'tan Yeyue (): Bai'etan and Shamian Island * Donghu Chunxiao (): Dongshan Lake Park 1986 * Hongling Xuri (): Memorial Mausoleum to the Martyrs in Guangzhou Uprising, or Martyrs' Park as more commonly known * Huangpu Yunqiang (): Huangpu Port and Xinsha Port * Yunshan Jinxiu (): Baiyun Mountain * Zhuhai Qingbo (): Haizhu Square * Huanghua Haoqi (): Mausoleum of 72 Martyrs at Huanghuagang, or Huanghuagang Park as more commonly known * Yuexiu Cenglou (): Zhenhai Tower * Liuhua Yuyu (): Buildings surrounding China Import And Export Fair (Canton Fair) Building (Liuhua Pavilion) and Guangzhou railway station * Longdong Qilin (): South China Botanical Garden 2002 The following are those chosen through public appraisal in 2001 and brought out in 2002. * Yunshan Diecui (): Baiyun Mountain * Zhushui Yeyun (): Pearl River * Yuexiu Xinhui (): Yuexiu Mountain * Tianhe Piaojuan (): CITIC Plaza and the artificial waterfall at Guangzhou East railway station square * Guci Liufang (): Chen Clan Academy and Guangdong Folk Craftwork Museum * Huanghua Haoyue (): Mausoleum of 72 Martyrs at Huanghuagang, or Huanghuagang Park as more commonly known * Wuhuan Chenxi (): Guangdong Olympic Stadium, or known as Aoti Main Stadium * Lianfeng Guanhai (): Panyu Lianhua Mountain 2011 The following are those chosen through public appraisal and brought out in 2011. * Tayao Xincheng (): Canton Tower, Chigang Pagoda, Haixinsha, Flower City Square, Guangzhou Twin Towers, CITIC Plaza, etc. * Zhushui Liuguang (): Pearl River (segment from Bai'etan to Pazhou), Wharves, Bai'etan, Shamian Island, Yanjiang Lu, Ersha Island, Haixinsha, Guangzhou Convention and Exhibition Center, etc. * Yunshan Diecui (): Baiyun Mountain, Yuntai Garden, etc. * Yuexiu Fenghua (): Yuexiu Mountain, Zhenhai Tower, Five Rams Statue, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument, etc. * Guxi Liufang (): Chen Clan Academy and Guangdong Folk Craftwork Museum * Liwan Shengjing (): Litchi Bay, Liwan Lake, Arcades on Enning Lu, Xiguan Residences, etc. * Kecheng Jinxiu (): Guangzhou Science City * Shidi Changwan (): Nansha Wetland Park Gallery See also * Other Eight Views around China, Japan, &c.; References External links  Category:Buildings and structures in Guangzhou ","title":"Eight Sights of Guangzhou"},{"id":"32072988","text":"Primula sinensis, () or the Chinese primrose, is a plant species in the genus Primula.

History =Background= The I&SL; was promoted in 1900 in order to exploit seams of coal existing along the Chariton River, historically known as the Novinger Coalfield. There was no railroad following the river valley, and it was hoped that building one which did would encourage the sinking of more coal mines.Mineral Wealth of Missouri 1870 p. 11 The Quincy, Missouri and Pacific Railroad (QM&P;) had opened from the Mississippi River crossing at Quincy, Illinois to Trenton in 1881.Poor's Manual of Railroads 1884 p. 659 This passed through the town of Novinger which had been founded in 1878, and where the first coal mine was sunk in 1883 in response to the arrival of the railroad. The QM&P; went bankrupt in 1886, and was re-cast as the Quincy, Omaha and Kansas City Railway (QO&KC;). The Omaha, Kansas City and Eastern Railroad (OKC&E;) extended the line in 1897 from Trenton to Pattonsburg, Missouri for a connection to Omaha via the Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska Railway which later became part of the Wabash Railroad. The OKC&E; was an affiliate of the Kansas City, Pittsburgh & Gulf Railroad until the latter's bankruptcy in 1899. The KCP&G; was owned by Arthur Stilwell and was a predecessor of the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), which came into being after Stilwell was ejected and the company reconstructed in 1899. From Pattonsburg to Smithville was built by the Kansas City and Northern Connecting Railroad in 1898, and from Smithville to Kansas City in the following year by the Kansas City and Atlantic Railroad. These lines were formally consolidated as the QO&KC; (the OK Line or Quincy Route) in 1902 after further insolvency. Interstate Commerce Commission Reports Vol. 134 1927 p. 832 =Initiation= The I&SL; project was initiated by three employees of the QO&KC; which was, at the time, operating the circuitous route between Quincy and Kansas City via Pattonsburg, Missouri as from 1898. The three were W.S. McCaull, claim agent for the QO&KC; , H.F. Reddig the company's chief clerk, and H.H. Kendrick the auditor. Despite their status as employees of the QO&KC;, the three founded a new railroad company on their own behalf on 11 May 1901. Despite being very short of funds, the three managed to build a demonstration line of about five miles to Shibleys Point, heading north from the end of a mine spur owned by the Kansas City Midland Coal Company, which in its turn had a junction with the QO&KC; at Novinger. The project was presented with a wider scope, that of building a trunk line from Des Moines, Iowa to St Louis via the coalfield. =Construction= Funding for the project came from two sources. Investors in the KCS took note of the business potential of the I&SL; as a feeder to their line at Kansas City via the QO&KC; route, and thus began investing in the company from later in 1901. However, the Gates-Keefe-Lambert Syndicate of St. Louis and Chicago acquired a controlling interest in the same period.Lloy, Gary (Spring 2013). \\"The History of Novinger Timeline\\". Novinger Renewal, Inc. quarterly newsletter. The investment allowed for the quick construction of a line north to Centerville, Iowa where a junction was made with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific (CRIP) railroad at a point called \\"Summit\\". Now the QO&KC;, about to go bankrupt, had supported the I&SL; as a valuable feeder for coal traffic, up to the point where the latter made connection with the CRIP and so was in a position to steal coal traffic from the QO&KC; at Novinger. The I&SL; was vulnerable, because it relied upon the line of the Kansas City Midland Coal Company line to get to Novinger. So, officials of the QO&KC; blocked the connection by force and had a confrontation with I&SL; construction crews, which led to members of the latter being arrested and put under bond. The situation was sorted out in March 1903 when the CBQ bought out the shareholders of the I&SL;, and formally merged the company in 1905.Connelly, E: Railroad Operation, Vol. 2 2002 p. 247 The QO&KC;, which had gone bankrupt in 1902, wasn't going to argue with the CBQ -and was itself bought out in 1908, although it remained as a wholly owned subsidiary of the CBQ until 1939 when its line was abandoned and the company dissolved.Connelly, E: Railroad Operation, Vol. 4 2002 p. 83 =Reconstruction= The I&SL; was built predominantly of 66 lbs (30 kg) rail or lighter, and was operated by small steam engines.Lloy, Gary (Spring 2013). \\"The History of Novinger Timeline\\". Novinger Renewal, Inc. quarterly newsletter. Immediately on obtaining ownership, the CBQ ordered an upgrade which involved closing and re- laying the line between Sedan in Iowa and Novinger. The line between Sedan and Centerville was abandoned as redundant. Also an extension was constructed between Novinger and Elmer, Missouri, into more coal-bearing land in Adair County, Missouri but stopping short a few thousand feet short from intersecting the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) main line through northern Missouri. The terminus was named after Elmer on the ATSF, but was actually in Mercyville which Elmer had supplanted when the ATSF built a station there.Lloy, Gary (Spring 2013). \\"The History of Novinger Timeline\\". Novinger Renewal, Inc. quarterly newsletter. The I&SF; was henceforward operated by the CBQ as an off-branch of the QO&KC.; =Proposed extension= However, the CBQ did not immediately abandon the intention of the original promoters to reach St Louis. It began work on an extension from Elmer across the ATSF to Macon with stations at Barnesville and Bloomington, then from Macon through Enterprise and Woodlawn in the direction of Holliday. The ultimate destination would have been Mexico, and a connection with its line there to St Louis. None of this was completed.The Heart of our Country, George F. Cram 1909, Missouri map =Decline= The decline of the I&SL; was rapid. As public subsidies for highways and buses/trucks became substantial in the 1920s, the freight and passenger businesses were quickly drained away. Coal mines became difficult to operate in the area due to mine flooding and the costs of pumping excessive water, and due to thin seams of coal. Higher labor costs were a product of mine unionization activity but, in fairness to the miners, the jobs were dirty, hazardous and under-paid when one considers the lengthy hours worked and the accident rates. On September 23, 1936 the Interstate Commerce Commission gave approval for the I&SL; to cease operations from Elmer to South Gifford, and from Novinger to Sedan where coal mining had ceased.Locomotive Engineers Journal Vol. 70 1936 p. 822 This did not mark the end of the passenger service, which continued on the stub from Novinger to South Gifford. In 1939, the QO&KC; was abandoned west of Milan, and the company dissolved. The CBQ took direct ownership of the remaining line from Quincy to Milan, via Novinger.Interstate Commerce Commission Reports Vol. 233 1939 p. 471 In 1942, most of the surviving line was abandoned, apart from a short section from Novinger accessing the spur leading to the Baiotto Mine of the Billy Creek Coal Company. This was to be the last mine operating in the coalfield, closing in 1966, and it was sending most of its output to the city power plant of Kirksville. Operations were on a call and demand basis, meaning that the mine manager would phone CBQ Control if and when a pick-up was needed. This meant that the arrangement could be terminated by mutual agreement, and was no longer a statutory common carrier service.Interstate Commerce Commission Reports 1942 p. 21Minerals Yearbook 1965 p. 478 In 1947 the CBQ and the coal company agreed to terminate the service, the last segment of the I&SL; to the coal mine was abandoned and the tracks were removed. Remains A few of the former depots survive to this day, some being converted for other uses. An example of this is a private home in Yarrow. The South Gifford depot still stands but is in very poor condition. Despite decades of overgrowth, aerial images still reveal some segments of the former I&SL; track bed. Operations =Freight= Freight on the line was always dominated by coal, for which the line was built. It came from underground mines at Connelsville, Mendota, Yarrow, and Youngstown in Missouri, and in the Coal City and Exline area in southern Iowa. Other business included a cucumber pickling plant at Worthington, Missouri, and farm shipments from Livonia, Worthington, and from the Elmer, Missouri area.Lloy, Gary (Spring 2013). \\"The History of Novinger Timeline\\". Novinger Renewal, Inc. quarterly newsletter. =Passengers= Passenger service was also available on the line until 1936. In February 1926, for example, the CBQ's public timetable had the Sedan to Elmer service as \\"Table 33a\\". This featured a mixed train (that is, a freight pick-up service with a passenger coach attached) starting from Elmer at 5:10 in the early morning, reaching Sedan at 9:00 and then returning at 9:20 to arrive back at Elmer at 12:40. The journey between the termini took 3 hours 20 minutes, an average speed of .Official Guide February 1926 p. 974 This service continued, albeit truncated, when the line was reduced to Novinger - South Gifford. =Adair County Railroad= Apart from private spurs to coal mines, a single off-branch from the line existed, called the Adair County Railroad. This had been incorporated in 1904 to build six miles (9.7 km) of line to coal mines from Youngstown, and was a little subsidiary of the CBQ. The local name for the tap line of this outfit was \\"the Spur Up Billy's Creek\\".Interstate Commerce Commission Reports Vol. 134 1928 p. 576 The line ran north-west from Youngstown.The Heart of our Country, George F. Cram 1909, Missouri map Route The original northern terminus of the railroad was Centerville, where a junction had been made with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. From there, the line ran closely parallel to the CBQ to Sedan. The companion line here was the Keokuk and Western Railroad, which became part of the CBQ in 1901. The I&SL; line between Centerville and Sedan was abandoned as redundant in 1903. From Sedan, the line ran to Coal City, Iowa before crossing the state line into Missouri. Passenger stops after that were Livonia, Mapleton, Worthington, Hilberton, Connelsville and Novinger. At the last named place, the QO&KC; line was crossed and the two lines shared a station. Then came Youngstown, Yarrow, South Gifford and finally the terminus at Elmer.Walker, M: SPV's Comprehensive Railroad Atlas of North America, Prairies East & Ozarks 2004 p. 39 Elmer also had the main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, but the lines did not connect and the two stations were a mile apart.Official Guide February 1926 p. 1472  References  Category:Iowa railroads Category:Missouri railroads ","title":"Iowa and St. Louis Railway"},{"id":"32072998","text":"Rear-Admiral John Leveson-Gower (11 July 1740 - 15 August 1792)Record for Admiral Hon.

As a junior officer he saw action at the Battle of Lagos in August 1759 during the Seven Years' War. As captain of he was present at the Battle of Ushant on 17 July 1778 during the American War of Independence. He went on to be a junior Lord of the Admiralty and then First Naval Lord. He also sat as Member of Parliament for several constituencies. Family and early life The Battle of Lagos in 1759 off Portugal - painting by Thomas Luny John was born on 11 July 1740, the second son of John, first earl Gower, by his third wife Lady Mary Tufton, daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet and widow of Anthony Grey, earl Harold. His half-brother, Granville Leveson-Gower, inherited his father's earldom and would use his political influence to help John's career. John was privately educated and then entered the navy, receiving his lieutenant's commission in 1758. His first command was the fireship , in which he saw action at the Battle of Lagos on 18 August 1759, serving under Admiral Edward Boscawen. Leveson-Gower was advanced to the rank of post captain on 30 June 1760 and took the 32-gun to the Mediterranean to serve under Sir Charles Saunders. While commanding Quebec he captured the 18-gun French privateer Phoenix in December 1760 off Cape Palos. Leveson-Gower then commanded the 64-gun , sailing her to Guinea and the West Indies in 1765. Later he commanded the frigates and , and finally the guardship at Plymouth in 1774. He was appointed to command the 74-gun in the English Channel in 1775, where he captured several American ships. He was present at the Battle of Ushant on 17 July 1778, where he strongly supported Admiral Augustus Keppel, Valiant sustaining casualties of six killed and twenty-six wounded. He gave evidence at Keppel's subsequent court martial, defending his admiral's actions, and resigned his command afterwards.

From January to April 1783 Gower was one of the junior lords of the admiralty on the Board of Admiralty with Lord Howe. He resigned after the formation of the Fox‚ÄìNorth coalition in April, but rejoined when the Pitt Ministry was formed. From December 1783 to August 1789 he was First Naval Lord.Rodger, p. 69 He continued at the Admiralty with the Earl of Chatham until August 1789. During this time he hoisted a broad pennant in in 1785, for a summer cruise around Great Britain with Prince William Henry; and was commodore in in 1787, in command of the Channel Squadron. He was returned as the member for Appleby in 1784, sitting until 1790. He was elected to Newcastle under Lyme that year and spoke four times on Admiralty matters in Parliament. On 24 September 1787 he was advanced to be rear-admiral, and in the following summer hoisted his flag again in Edgar in the Channel. In 1788 he took an enlarged squadron to the West Indies. During the Spanish armament in 1790 he was again first captain to Lord Howe, and in 1791 was selected as one of the rear-admirals to serve under Admiral Lord Hood in the fleet assembling to counter Russian aggression. The threat passed however and the fleet was disbanded. Death and issue He died of a stroke while shaving on 15 August 1792 at his house at Bill Hill, Wokingham, and was buried on 23 August at Barkham parish church, Berkshire.

A parallel taxon, including all earth-based lineages, is Terrestria. * Kingdom: Jakobia - All members of Marciana whose anatomy and physiology are adapted to the ultraviolet radiation and other conditions characteristic of the Martian topsoil and other Martian biomes. (The name of the kingdom is an homage to the Bavarian-Argentine neurobiologist Christfried Jakob.) * Genus and species: Gillevinia straata (in honor of Gilbert Levin and Patricia Straat, who conducted the original Viking experiments) The intended effect was to reverse the burden of proof concerning the life issue, but biologists stated that naming a 'species' at this point is inappropriate, as it may lend credibility to the possibility that life has been detected.Science works through Mars lander life controversy.

He is the artist and writer of The Incredible Conduit and white plastic. Gray is a native of the comic book hotbed of Windsor, Ontario, Canada which has produced an unusual number of comic book creators/artists including Darwyn Cooke, David Finch, Jeff Lemire, and Jason Fabok. Gray occasionally appears at comic events with friends/associates and also Windsor area natives, Jason Fabok (artist: justice League of America) and David Finch (artist/writer: Batman, The Dark Knight). In late 2015, Gray announced several new comic book properties he'll be illustrating with actor/comedian, Kenny Hotz (Kenny vs. Spenny, Triumph of the Will, South Park). 'Lou and Blue' is their first collaboration. The two of them have become a popular, yet one of the most unlikely pairings on the comic book convention circuit. Career =Syndicated Comic Strips= Gray began his professional career in comics in December 2000 as the writer and creator of Saturday Afternoon, a syndicated daily comic strip. The strip featured, Baldoon, an eight-year-old boy who sought relief from his mundane days through adventures in an imaginary world inside a framed photograph. The strip also featured the characters Revello, the Clown, Pixie, and Pin. The quirky strip is still in production and has developed a niche following. Buoyed by the success of Saturday Afternoon, Gray created a second feature called Mick & Me in March 2007. The comic featured a younger version of the author and his brother, Mick. The feature was realistically rendered and proved difficult to reproduce in the limited spaces allotted to daily newspaper comics. Mick & Me never found wide syndication and ceased being produced in 2009. =The Incredible Conduit= In August 2009, Gray launched what was to become his most popular feature to date, The Incredible Conduit. Originally created as a daily newspaper strip for the CanWest chain of papers in Canada, The Incredible Conduit features the adventures of Raymond Cole, a university student who developed the ability to absorb then project all forms of energy. The Incredible Conduit also features Maria Pasqua, an engineering genius who developed The Conduit's suit to assist him in controlling his newfound powers. The primary drive for The Conduit and Maria is to find their lab partner who has been missing since the blast that gave Raymond his conduit-like powers. The feature was contracted out to Legacy Comics Publishing in 2010 to be published in comic book format. In July 2015, Tony Gray contracted actor, Rob Archer (6' 6\\", 285 lbs), as a 'comic actor; to portray The Conduit in the comic books and at live appearances and signings. Archer has appeared in feature films such as 'Kick Ass 2', Pixels' and 'A Christmas Horror Story'. He has appeared in many television series including regular roles in 'Lost Girl' and 'Defiance'. =Legacy Comics= In January 2011, Gray purchased 50% ownership of Legacy Comics and now co-owns the comic book publishing company with Justin Walsh. Legacy Comics Publishing is a subsidiary of GlassMonkey Studios Inc. and handles the commercial, educational and promotional line of comics. These comics often feature characters licensed through GlassMonkey Studios Inc. =Glassmonkey Studios Inc.= In 2011, Tony Gray partnered with colleague David Finch to incorporate Glassmonkey Studios. Gray and Finch along with musician, Andrew Barlow (formerly of the Doomsday Dogs), and sound engineer, Scott Barlow founded the company to provide a \\"start to finish\\" facility for their various independent illustration, animation and film ventures. Interviews with Gray indicate an interest in producing an animated version of his popular comic book series, The Incredible Conduit. After re- signing to a second exclusive contract with DC Comics, David Finch sold his shares in GlassMonkey Studios to Gray. In 2013, GlassMonkey Studios expanded their line of comic book publications to include, Tales of the Incredible Conduit, Apes in the Woods, and Improbabilia. In 2015 GlassMonkey Studios began work on a new comic book series called, 'Lou & Blue', which feature an art thief and the Blue Boy as characters who engage in adventures within famous paintings. The comic feature is based upon an original script by, Kenny Hotz. Kenny Hotz is best known for his work as an actor in 'Kenny vs. Spenny' and 'Triumph of the Will'. Hotz is also the creator of the television series 'Testees' and has written for 'South Park'.

Early life  Williamson‚Äôs early life was packed with adventure. Born in Bristol in 1872 and educated at Clifton High School, he left school at the age of 13 to enlist on his uncle‚Äôs tea-clipper bound for Australia and the United States. When the vessel docked at San Diego, Williamson jumped ship and found work on a farm near Los Angeles, then with his aunt on her homestead. Intending to prospect for gold, Williamson acquired a mule and shotgun and travelled to the Nevadas where he acquired a mine. When this venture ended in failure, Williamson went to San Francisco and enlisted on a cargo ship bound for Bordeaux. San Francisco Bay c.1889 Following a brief visit to France, Williamson returned to California via the Panama Canal and undertook various activities: investing unsuccessfully in a railway company, taking part in a vaudeville act and trying his luck as an amateur boxer but it was not long before he returned to the sea. Williamson became fourth mate on a whaler which sailed to the Bering Straits returning again to San Francisco after an eight-month voyage. He then enlisted for a trading voyage to the South Seas and settled for a time in the Caroline Islands, trading in sea-cucumbers. But he was arrested for selling rifles to rebel tribesmen and was incarcerated in a Manila jail. After bribing a guard, Williamson escaped to the American consul Alexander Russell Webb and boarded a British ship bound for Hong Kong. He pursued a seafaring career as quartermaster of the SS Chusan. Then, after a brief sojourn in Bombay, he boarded the SS Siam for the British colony of Aden. On his arrival, he joined the Aden Constabulary. Already interested in Islam, he undertook Islamic study in Aden and, after a year had passed, he made his formal shahada, was circumcised and changed his name to Abdullah Fadhil. This did not go down well with the Aden authorities who packed him off to India where Williamson was discharged from the Constabulary.Hope, Stanton, Arabian Adventurer, the Story of Haji Williamson, (Robert Hale) 1951, ASIN: B004U20XYW  Trade and pearls  Mecca, ca. 1910. Bird's-eye view of Kaaba crowded with pilgrimsWilliamson‚Äôs next incarnation was as a trader of camels and horses in Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait. With the money he acquired from this venture, in 1894 he was able to join the Hajj caravan to Mecca and thus gained the sobriquet ‚ÄúHaji‚Äù. Thereafter Williamson traded horses with the British Army in Bombay and imported foreign goods to his home town of Zubair in Iraq. On one occasion, he caused uproar when he appeared in the local suq on a penny-farthing bicycle, never before seen in those parts. Relations with the British were changeable: they suspected him of gun running in the Persian Gulf and yet were happy to use him as a secret agent and spy hunter during World War I. In later years, his trading interests in the Persian Gulf meant that he veered towards legitimacy. The profits of horse-trading allowing him to buy a dhow, he undertook a number of voyages around the Persian Gulf. He regularly met Royal Navy gunboats as they criss-crossed the Persian Gulf in stop and search operations to suppress an illicit trade in rifles, slaves and contraband. Williamson also tried his hand in the pearling business, joining the great pearling fleet in the Persian Gulf. The pearling season known al-Ghaus al- Kabir (‚ÄúThe Big Dive‚Äù) ran from May to September when a fleet of some 4,000 dhows ranging from the regular sambuk to the larger boum and baghlah would set out from the many ports of the Persian Gulf. Each carried a master, mate, divers, assistant divers and apprentices drawn from those ports, Oman and beyond. Their purpose was to fish for the most valuable pearls. The venture was not particularly successful and, with a large family to support, a steady job was an attractive proposition.  Kuwait  =Appointment to Anglo- Persian= In the 1920s, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was struggling to counter Major Frank Holmes' influence in Kuwait. Looking around for a local man to help the company in its dealings with the local Arabs, managing director Sir Arnold Wilson remembered Williamson from his days in Iraq. An Englishman who had ‚Äúgone native‚Äù seemed an obvious choice as interpreter, guide and general factotum, so Wilson sent for Williamson and offered him a job. Williamson had long since adopted the dress and customs of a town Arab. But when doing business with Westerners, he would put on a navy-blue suit with double-breasted jacket while retaining an Arab headdress and toying with his prayer beads, in those days an eccentric fusion of east and west. In 1924, Anglo Persian gave Williamson a family house in Abadan, appointed him ‚ÄúInspector of Gulf Agencies‚Äù and sent him to Kuwait where he set about persuading sheikhly advisers to switch their allegiances from Major Frank Holmes to Anglo Persian. He also assisted the Anglo-Persian representative, Archibald Chisolm, in the negotiations. Williamson was to do what he could to counter Holmes' influence, which including providing the sheikh's advisers with free meals and gifts. But in 1933 Anglo-Persian joined forces with Gulf Oil leaving Williamson out of the negotiations and, in 1935, the two companies concluded a concession agreement from the sheikh. = Relations with Major Frank Holmes = Frank Holmes, a New Zealand-British mining engineer who had made his name as an oil concession hunter, was already highly regarded by the Gulf Arabs. Although Holmes and Williamson were cast on opposite sides of the competition in Kuwait (Holmes represented Gulf Oil), they were of a similar ilk, both independent with a strong empathy for the Arab point of view. However, they hated each other with a passion and developed a rivalry which led Williamson (perhaps melodramatically) to believe that his life was in danger, constantly looking over his shoulder for an assassin trailing in his wake. In fact, most of their rivalry was played out in the grand lunches they threw for the notables engaged in the oil negotiations.  Qatar and Abu Dhabi  In 1925, Williamson acted as interpreter, guide and general factotum to the Anglo-Persian survey of Qatar led by George Martin Lees. Williamson returned there in 1934 with Anglo-Persian representative Charles Mylles to secure an oil concession from the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al-Thani,Note of Qatar Oil Concession, by C.C. Mylles, 16 July 1934, BP Archive 135500, Warwick University but negotiations faltered and Mylles had to return in order to complete the agreement on 17 May 1935. Williamson acted in a similar capacity for the first visits of Anglo-Persian geologists to Abu Dhabi in 1934, and was responsible for signing the first oil concession for that country in January 1935. He returned in 1936 to guide another oil survey for Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. ‚ÄúWe landed from the Gulf mail steamer at Dubai after a day and night lying to and waiting until one of the most violent storms of thunder and rain we had ever experienced had blown itself out,‚Äù wrote one of the geologists. ‚ÄúDuring the first few months in Dubai we were advised never to leave the house without an armed escort, as we were the first Europeans to live in the town and it was considered desirable to accustom the local populace gradually to our presence.‚Äù The party travelled inland with the sheikh and his followers who used each occasion as an excuse for hunting. ‚ÄúWith our two cars, we had the sheikh‚Äôs and at least one other filled with his men, 6 or 8 to a car, each with his saddle bag of belongings and his rifle. Room had also to be found for cooking pots and one or two hawks, while on one occasion a large saluki (greyhound) was also squeezed in. Our routes followed camel trails, the only tracks of any kind which existed, and as most of the country was sand the cars were very often stuck.‚ÄùT.F. Williamson (no relation of Haji Williamson,) as quoted by F.E. Wellings and reproduced in The Trek of the Oil Finders: A History of Exploration for Petroleum, American Association of Petroleum Geologists (1975), pages 1344-5. However, there were lingering suspicions among British officials that Williamson was favouring local sheikhs over the interests of the oil company.for example, C.C. Mylles to the General Manager, APOC, 28 February 1935, archive reference 78479, pp 69-70, BP Archive, Warwick University. By 1937, there were still five Gulf sheikhs due to sign oil concession agreements. Frank Holmes at this time was acting for Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and Williamson (also employed by PCL) began to intrigue against him.Muhammed Morsi Abdullah, The United Arab Emirates, A Modern History, (Croom Helm) 1978, , pp. 66-71. Williamson sent a letter ‚Äì intercepted by the British - to the sheikh of Ras al-Khaimah encouraging him to hold out for better terms from PCL. Williamson also sent a man to the sheikh of Kalba in order to stiffen his resistance against the company. For the British Political Resident, this was the last straw. On 27 July, he wrote that it was ‚Äúundesirable that Williamson should be employed anywhere on the Arab coast.‚ÄùLt Col. Fowle to the Secretary of State for India, 27 July 1937, IOR/L/PS/12/233, India Office Records, British Library. So Williamson retired from company life and returned to his family and a quiet life in his house in Zubair.  Retirement and death  Williamson had married twice, one of his wives coming from Zubair and the other from Baghdad, and fathered several children. He retired into typical Arab life at Kut-el-Hajjaj near Basra where he supervised daily work on the date palm and orange tree plantations on his estate. As well as enjoying the company of his children and grandchildren, he liked to read penny-Westerns with titles like Two-Gun Pete and Mayhem in Dodge City. He remained a devout follower of Islam and was a regular visitor to the Ashar Mosque in Basra. He died in 1958.  Conspiracy theory  In recent years, a conspiracy theory has emerged that the British secretly backed Ayatollah Khomeini in overthrowing the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1979.British-Ruhollah Khomeini conspiracy theory One aspect of this theory is a claim that Khomeini was part British, being a son of Haji Williamson. However, no conclusive evidence aside from written documents (e.g. DNA evidence) has been provided to support this theory.

In 2004, he founded Alfanar the first Arab venture philanthropy organisation aiming to introduce a more effective and sustainable approach to development in the Arab region.  Early life  Ben Halim was born in Tripoli, Libya on 4 December 1955 to a Palestinian mother, Yusra Kanaan, and Libyan father, Mustafa Ben Halim. His father served as Prime Minister of Libya from 1954 to 1957 and Libyan Ambassador to France from 1958 to 1960. After the coup that brought Muammar Gaddafi to power in 1969, Ben Halim and his family were exiled, and moved to Beirut before settling in London. He was educated at Atlantic College in Wales, and went on to study Finance at Warwick University before receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School.  Career  He had a career in investment banking which included positions at JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs, where he became a managing director. In 2000, Ben Halim was responsible for the $2 billion flotation of Turkcell, which at the time was the largest ever emerging market IPO. Exile from Libya taught Ben Halim early on about the perils of politics in the Arab world. Combined with the stories of his mother's flight from Palestine, it had a strong influence on his belief in justice and democracy as necessary tools for improving lives and communities in the region. In a commentary piece published in The Los Angeles Times in February 2003, Ben Halim criticised \\"self-serving, unrepresentative governments that have, with few exceptions, ruled the Arab world since the 19th century\\". He hoped that changing the Iraqi regime in 2003 would cause similar changes in leadership across the region. He volunteered to work with the British forces and was appointed Deputy Director of private sector development with the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). However, he soon became frustrated with the CPA's approach. \\"He [Ben Halim] felt that the occupying force seemed more focused on quick gain rather than building a sustainable framework that would survive its departure.\\" He resigned after only a few months. = Alfanar and investment banking. = Ben Halim's time in Iraq strengthened his determination to put into practice what Arab governments had long failed to do ‚Äì improve livelihoods by responding to community needs.

(1670?‚Äì1726) was an English writer on natural history. Life He was born about 1670, and was descended from the Barhams of Barham Court in Kent. He has often been confused with his son, Henry Barham, M.D., who became the owner of several sugar plantations and a significant quantity of slaves in the Colony of Jamaica. The main events of the life of the elder Henry Barham are recorded by himself in one of his letters to Sir Hans Sloane. Sloane MS. 4036, pages 357‚Äì358 His father, a physician, intended to give him a university education, but died before he could carry out his wishes. As the mother married soon afterwards, the boy, then about fourteen years of age, was left to his own resources, and became apprentice to a surgeon. This situation he left to become surgeon's mate in the Vanguard, from which he was promoted to be master surgeon in another man-of-war. He went to Spain, thence to Madras, and thence to Jamaica. As in 1720, Add. MS. 22639, f. 19 he refers to his son as having practised physic and surgery in Jamaica for the last twenty years, he himself had probably settled in the island twenty years before the end of the century. According to his own account, he obtained a lucrative practice, and was appointed surgeon-major of the military forces in Jamaica. About 1716, he came to England and settled at Chelsea, devoting his chief attention to the rearing of the silkworm, and the manufacture of silk, on which subject he published a treatise in 1719. His name appears in 1717 on the list of members of the Royal Society, and he states also that shortly after he came to England he was made free of the Company of Surgeons, but his hopes of obtaining the diploma of M.D. do not appear to have been fulfilled, for the only change that occurs in his designation on the roll of the Royal Society is from \\"Mr.\\" to \\"Esquire.\\" In his application, in 1720, for the situation of mineral superintendent to a company formed to prosecute silver mining in Jamaica,Addison manuscript 22639, following 18‚Äì20 he stated that his business prospects were so good that he could not sacrifice them for less than ¬£500 a year. He received the situation on his own terms; but the enterprise, which had been undertaken chiefly through his representations, proved a complete failure, and though a year's salary was due to him it was never paid. He continued, however, to reside in Jamaica till his death at Spanish Town in May 1726. Sloane MS. 4036, page 377 A memorial tablet is in the cathedral at Spanish Town.Roby's Monuments of Spanish Town, page 38 Naturalist Barham states that after he came to Jamaica he \\"read many books, especially physical.\\" His letters and manuscripts indicate that in early life his education had been neglected; but although sometimes led astray by his own ideas, he possessed a knowledge of the fauna and flora of Jamaica. Logwood, now common there, was introduced by him in 1715. Works Sir Hans Sloane, who refers to him in terms of high commendation, received from him many valuable communications, of which he made large use in his Natural History of Jamaica. Among these was a treatise, Hortus Americanus, sent in 1711. This treatise was published in 1794 with a preface in which it is stated to be the work of Henry Barham, M.D., who, it is added, practised as a physician in Jamaica from the beginning of the century, and after acquiring large property by marriage returned to England in 1740 and settled at Staines near Egham. The Henry Barham thus referred to was the son of Henry Barham, F.R.S., but that the father was the author of the book is proved beyond all doubt by letters in the Sloane manuscripts (4036). Henry Barham, F.R.S., wrote also a History of Jamaica, which his son, after his death, sent to Sir Hans Sloane, \\"to see the best method of printing it\\", but it was never published. The original copy, in the handwriting of the father, and inscribed \\"wrote by Henry Barham, Senr. F.R.S.,\\" is in the British Museum. Sloane MS. 3918 In another copy, in a different hand, Add. MS. 12422 there is a note by Edward Long erroneously attributing the work to Henry Barham, M.D. Barham also wrote two papers for the Royal Society: An Account of a Fiery Meteor seen in Jamaica to strike the Earth;Philosophical Transactions 1718, Abrev. vi. page 368 and Observations on the Produce of the Silkworm and of Silk in England, 1719, Abrev. vi. page 426.  Dr Henry Barham the Younger  Dr Henry Barham (1692-1746), the son, owned a plantation named Spring Plantation, which produced sugar and boasted a large population of African slaves. In 1728, he married a widow named Mary Heith, and inherited the Jamaican plantation of Mesopotamia in western Jamaica. Mary had lost two previous husbands, Ephraim Stephenson and a man named Heith.Richard Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2014), p. 27. After taking control of Mesopotamia, the younger Barham borrowed from several Kingston merchants, and purchased more slaves to increase the sugar production on his estates. His plantations in Westmoreland Parish thrived, and he generated a lot of wealth from sugar and rum sales in the 1730s. In 1731, however, his sister Elizabeth died at Mesopotamia, and his wife Mary and her sister Sarah Arcedeckne both died there four years later. In 1736, as a result, the younger Henry Barham migrated to England.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantation, p. 28. Between 1727 and 1736, Barham had tripled the slave population at Mesopotamia to 248. Barham left the management of his estate to his medical colleague, Dr James Paterson. But even though he now resided in England, Barham maintained his connections to Jamaica. There, he married again, this time to another wealthy widow from Jamaica, Elizabeth Smith Foster Ayscough, and inherited from her five more Jamaican plantations and 768 slaves, valued at about ¬£34,000.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantation, pp. 28-9. Barham had no children of his own, and he inherited seven step-children from Elizabeth's two previous marriages. He made Elizabeth's son, Joseph, his heir, under the stipulation that he take the name Barham in order to inherit Mesopotamia. The boy complied, and changed his name to Joseph Foster Barham I to become his heir. In 1746, Barham died and Elizabeth ran the estate until 1750, when Joseph was old enough to assume control of Mesopotamia.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantation, p. 29.UCL Slave Legacies, retrieved 23 April 2020 https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146635190 In 1746, the younger Henry Barham died leaving his property to his wife Elizabeth and his step-son Joseph.

Life His birthplace and parentage are unknown. He studied medicine at the University of Leyden, whose register is the only authority for his age and nationality. The entry of his matriculation, on 16 September 1743, describes him as an Englishman, aged 22. He took his doctor's degree in 1747, and settled to the practice of his profession in London. In the winter of 1749, Samuel Johnson established the Ivy Lane Club, which met weekly at a beefsteak house near St Paul's Cathedral; here Barker was introduced by a fellow-student, Samuel Dyer. Sir John Hawkins, in his Life of Johnson, has left character portraits of some of the members of the club; he describes Barker as a dissenter by education, a unitarian by religious profession, and a disciple of Lord Shaftesbury in philosophy. According to the same authority, Barker was an acute reasoner on ethics, a deep metaphysician, an excellent classical scholar, and a student of the Italian poets. He was, however, \\"a thoughtless young man\\", so slovenly in his habits, dress, and appearance as to be a jest to his companions; and naturally he \\"succeeded ill in his profession\\". In this sketch there is one characteristic detail which may be accepted with a confidence that Hawkins does not always merit. Johnson, we are told, so often snubbed Barker for his unitarianism, that his visits to the club became less and less frequent. Hawkins continues: The third part of Edwards's ‚ÄòGleanings of Natural History,‚Äô published in 1764, was translated by Barker from English into French, the work being printed in parallel columns in both languages. The books of the Royal College of Physicians show that he was \\"library-keeper\\" to that body from 1760 to 1771; how much longer he held the position‚Äîwhich was one of small emolument, and probably consistent with the exercise of his profession‚Äîor for what reason he ceased to hold it, a gap in the college records prevents us from ascertaining. It appears however that by 1781, a successor had been found for him. Boswell knew nothing of Barker at first hand, and it seems almost certain that his intimacy with Johnson was not renewed after his return from Trowbridge. To the sombre sequel of his career as described by Hawkins no other evidence is opposed.

He has published many works, most of them on library labels not available for sale to the public. His oeuvre stretches from classical, jazz, and funk to pop, psychedelia, and easy listening. Biography Born in Istanbul to a Montenegrin father and Greek mother, he studied piano, oboe and percussion as a child, and set up his own rock and roll band in the late 1950s. He moved to Paris in 1960, and played piano in nightclubs before joining a trio of Greek musicians, Les Doussis, with whom he played bass, guitar and keyboards. The group recorded for Barclay Records, and Niloviƒá then began to find work as an arranger and orchestrator for pop musicians and TV shows, as well as continuing to perform in jazz clubs. Martin Ruddock, \\"Rhythmes et Blues\\", Shindig, no.90, 2019, pp.42-46 In 1967, he joined with French-based singer Davy Jones (unrelated to the Monkees' singer) to set up Ju Ju Records, writing and producing a series of singles by the singer. His arrangements brought him to the attention of Andr√© Farry, the founder of library music label √âditions Montparnasse 2000 (MP 2000), who signed him as a producer. Niloviƒá started to release a series of LPs for the label, including Psyc Impressions, a commercially successful collaboration with Dave Sucky (real name Louis Delacour), described as \\"a heady stew of funky drums, gnarly fuzz guitar, and big band horn arrangements.\\" At the same time as producing a succession of albums on MP 2000 under the collective title of Impressions, widely used in TV documentaries, he worked as organist in the Paris production of Hair, using cast members on some of his recordings. He also released records on other labels, using pseudonyms including Andy Loore and Johnny Montevideo, and in the mid-1970s started working in Belgium where he produced the album Funky Tramway, one of his most successful recordings. He arranged the songs of Michel Jonasz and G√©rard Lenorman. After leaving MP 2000 in the late 1970s, Niloviƒá set up a music publishing company and focused on composing music. His reputation and influence grew, and his music began to be sampled by hip-hop and other musicians. The producer Dr. Dre sampled much of Niloviƒá's piece \\"Underground Session\\" for his track \\"Loose Cannons\\" from the album Compton. Producer No I.D. sampled Niloviƒá's song \\"In the Space\\", for Jay-Z's \\"D.O.A.

The home was built by Dr. Luke A. Port, with construction beginning in 1893, and completed in 1894. The historic house and property have been managed since 1974 by the non-profit Friends of Deepwood, and is owned by the City of Salem. It was designed by William C. Knighton as his first residential commission, and the landscape design was done by the Salem firm of Lord and Schryver starting in 1929. The Queen Anne style house contains Povey Brothers Studio stained glass windows throughout. The construction cost was between $12,000 and $15,000. Port Family (1894-1895) Dr. Port was born in Sussex, England, but was raised in Ohio. He served in the Ohio Infantry during the Civil War. A speculator, his business dealings were listed as \\"undercover\\" by Dun & Bradstreet in 1867. After settling near San Diego, Port moved his family to Salem in 1884 and opened the drugstore, Port and Son Drugs. His son, Omega, drowned in 1887. After completion of his new house, Dr. Port sold the home in 1895 to Judge George G. Bingham. Bingham Family (1895-1924) George G. Bingham moved into the home with his wife, Willie E. Harris, and young daughter Alice Bingham (Powell). The family would live in the home for almost 30 years, before George & Willie passed within a few weeks of each other. While living at 1116 Mission, the Bingham's enjoyed entertaining in their home. George was also an extensive gardener, maintaining a small orchard, large vegetable garden, and some livestock on their 4+ acre property on the south side of Salem. Alice Bingham, married to Keith Powell, inherited the home after the passing of her parents. She sold it to another Willamette Valley couple, Clifford Brown & Alice Bretherton Brown. Brown-Powell Family (1924-1968) The Browns spent a year completing numerous renovations on the Victorian home before moving in with their two sons, Werner & Chandler. Sadly, Clifford Brown passed in 1927 in a boating accident in British Columbia, leaving his widow in the house. Alice Brown would be the longest resident of Deepwood. She commissioned Lord & Schryver in 1929 to install the English- style gardens that the property is known for today. She is credited with naming the property Deepwood. In 1945, she remarried to Keith Powell, widower of Alice Bingham Powell. They were married in the gardens of Deepwood, and would continue to live in the home until 1968, when they decided to move to a smaller home nearby. Efforts to Save Deepwood (1968-1971) Largely through a strong community lead movement, Deepwood was saved from possible demolition. The home had been put up for sale, with strong commercial interest in the property, located just south of downtown Salem. City of Salem and the Friends of Deepwood (1971-Present) The City of Salem acquired the house in December 1971. The house and gardens are operated by the non-profit Friends of Deepwood, founded in 1974 as a house museum, public garden, and event venue. The gardens and property are maintained by the City of Salem and two other non-profits, the Deepwood Gardeners and Lord & Schryver Conservancy.

Premise Located in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois, businesswomen Minda Grabiec and Nikki Ruehl run a pawn shop that caters to women. The family- friendly boutique specializes in merchandise appealing to women, including jewelry, vintage Barbie dolls, and one-of-a-kind antiques. With their two business partners, Greg Holloway and Tom Brunzelle, they pawn, purchase, and sell just about anything to keep their fledgling company afloat. Each episode focuses on how pawn businesses operate, and features Minda and Nikki struggling to debunk the stereotype that the pawn business is only for men, although in reality pawn shops have long been regarded as a common occupation and service for women, and are often family businesses. The store was started by Holloway and Brunzelle in 2009. The pair decided to try to attract female customers, and recruited Grabiec and Ruehl, who invested in, and are partners in the business. Cast *Minda Grabiec *Nikki Ruehl *Greg Holloway *Tom Brunzelle Development According to the show's producer, Jason Morgan, while in town for his 20-year high school reunion, he dropped by Naperville Jewelry & Loan upon hearing that the store dealt in high-end items. An assistant had coincidentally found the shop while researching unusual pawn shops. This led to the shooting of the pilot episode, through August 2010. Reception Media Life Magazine described the interaction among the partners in the 2010 pilot episode as \\"pleasant enough,\\" but referred to the show as having \\"no pay off\\", since no merchandise is seen being pawned, only purchased by the shop, and no ultimate sales of merchandise is seen. The Hollywood Reporter gave a mixed review of the 2011 series premiere, stating, \\"Pawn Queens makes you wonder whether some professions are simply not worthy of their own show,\\" and called the series \\"not-so-dramatic\\" and \\"G-rated pawning, which makes you hungry for Vegas.\\" =Ratings= The premiere episode which aired in November 18, 2010 achieved 1.2 million viewers, prompting the TLC network to give the show its own series, which first aired May 5, 2011.

It was found in Eocene lake deposits in British Columbia, and was described in 2011. It is the first member of the Gondwana-distributed family Parastacidae to be found in the Northern Hemisphere, and is the only species in the genus Aenigmastacus. Twelve specimens are known, with a total body length of . On some specimens, details of the internal anatomy can be seen due to the exceptional preservation. Origin and description Aenigmastacus was discovered in the McAbee Fossil Beds of British Columbia, Canada,Feldmann et al. (2011), p. 320 at . The McAbee beds comprise a thickness of siliceous sediments within a sequence dominated by volcaniclastic rocks. They are believed to have formed from lake deposits, based on the presence of five families of freshwater fish and other terrestrial taxa, and the fossil-bearing sediments have been dated to the Ypresian (Lower Eocene). The deposition of a silica-rich sediment deriving from diatoms indicates a calm environment with little influx of terrestrial silt. There is an alternation of dark and light layers, which may indicate a seasonal change, such as freezing over in winter. The bottom of the lake was probably anoxic, which may have aided the preservation of fossils. Twelve \\"nearly complete\\" specimens of Aenigmastacus have been recovered, with a total body length of . The carapace is thin, but the form of the rostrum is not known. The antennae are as long as the carapace, but the eyes have not been preserved on any of the known specimens. The first pair of pereiopods are larger than the others, and are armed with a nearly symmetrical pair of chelae (claws). The pleon (abdomen) is generally smooth, and ends in a broad, slightly tapering telson with no diaeresis. The specimens of Aenigmastacus show exceptional preservation. In some specimens, dark areas formed of fluorapatite can be seen, which appear to represent soft tissue in a pattern congruent with the endophragmal skeleton of extant crayfishes.Feldmann et al. (2011), p. 329 The trace of the alimentary tract is also visible in some specimens. Taxonomy Aenigmastacus crandalli was described as a new genus and species in the Journal of Crustacean Biology by Rodney Feldmann, Carrie Schweitzer and John Leahy in 2011.Feldmann et al. (2011) The genus name, Aenigmastacus, derives from the Latin ', meaning \\"inexplicable\\", and the name of the genus Astacus, which is frequently used as a suffix for genus names of crayfish.Feldmann et al. (2011), p. 321 The specific epithet crandalli commemorates the crayfish expert Keith A. Crandall of George Washington University. The chief distinction between the Northern Hemisphere superfamily Astacoidea and the Southern Hemisphere superfamily Parastacoidea is usually the form of the genitalia, but these have not been preserved in any known specimen of Aenigmastacus.Feldmann et al. (2011), p. 324 Feldmann et al. therefore relied on the form of the telson, which has a diaeresis (division into two halves) in Astacoidea, but none in Parastacoidea; this distinction was noted by Thomas Henry Huxley, Martin Glaessner and Horton H. Hobbs, Jr.Feldmann et al. (2011), pp. 324‚Äì325 While no diaeresis is visible on the telson of Aenigmastacus, a diaeresis on the uropods, which is seen in both superfamilies, is preserved in some specimens of Aenigmastacus, suggesting that its apparent absence from the telson is not merely an artefact of preservation.Feldmann et al. (2011), pp. 325‚Äì327 Biogeography Fossils of freshwater crayfish are extremely rare.Feldmann et al. (2011), p. 322 Only 13 species are known in total, and only two from North America ‚Äì Pacifastacus chenoderma (Astacidae) and Procambarus primaevus (Cambaridae) ‚Äì both of which belong to families still represented in North America. Aenigmastacus, by contrast, belongs to the Southern Hemisphere family Parastacidae, and is that family's only Northern Hemisphere representative.Feldmann et al.

These proteins are symporters that are responsible for the sodium-dependent uptake of extracellular glutamate into the cell. They are integral membrane proteins located in the bacterial inner membrane. The best-studied member of the family is GltS from Escherichia coli. GltS contains ten transmembrane helices arranged in two antiparallel 5-helix domains and functions as a homodimer. Substrates for GltS include L- and D-glutamate, as well as toxic analogs Œ±-methylglutamate, and homocysteate. In studies of E. coli growth, bacteria without GltS were unable to grow in a medium where glutamate is the only source of carbon. The family is evolutionarily distant from other glutamate transporters. Phylogenetic analyses of GltS genes suggest that their presence in cyanobacteria can be attributed to at least two horizontal gene transfer events.

During the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests, \\"the only brave man in Saudi Arabia\\", Khaled al-Johani, was held in  ΩUlaysha Prison and it is suspected that several founding members of the Umma Islamic Party are being held there. Prisoners On 17 March 2004, Amnesty International stated that at least five people, mostly academics, had been held incommunicado for two days in  ΩUlaysha Prison because they had criticised a governmental body, the National Commission for Human Rights, and they had planned to create their own human rights organisation. =Prisoners held arbitrarily= The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention complained to Saudi Arabian authorities in 2007 about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Faiz bin Abdelmohsen Al Qaid, who had been held in  ΩUlaysha Prison since 12 October 2005 because he had given information to the Arab Commission for Human Rights and other organisations about human rights in Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabian prisons. The following year, the Working Group complained to Saudi authorities about the arbitrary arrest and detention of Abdel Rahman Samara, a Palestinian, who was held in  ΩUlaysha Prison for five and a half months before being transferred to al-Ha'ir Prison. The Working Group said that holding Samara \\"incommunicado, without access to a lawyer and without being brought to justice\\" constituted a violation of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Bahraini citizen Khalil  ΩAbdul Rahman  ΩAbdul Karim al-Janahi was held in  ΩUlaysha Prison for at least 4 months for an unknown reason, starting 26 April 2007, without access to lawyers and without a trial. In November 2008 he was transferred from the Saudi prison system to the United Arab Emirates, where he was detained without charge or trial until 11 June 2009, shortly after an Amnesty International appeal for his release. For the first four months in  ΩUlaysha Prison, Janahi was held in solitary confinement, handcuffed, in a one square metre cell, and had no contact with his family. Riyadh University professor Dr Bachr al-Bachr, described by the support group for uncharged prisoners Adala as \\"a peaceful advocate of political change who frequently publicly criticised his government and its policies\\", was detained on 15 March 2007 by Mabahith secret police at his home. He was held at  ΩUlaysha Prison and tortured. His family was first allowed access to him after nine months, at which time he stated that he \\"was being held in a refrigerated underground cell where he was permanently handcuffed and blindfolded.\\" =Political prisoners= Five founding members of the Umma Islamic Party, created in 2011, Dr. Ahmad bin Sa'd al-Ghamidi, Professor Sa'ud al-Dughaithir, Shaikh Abd al- ΩAziz al-Wuhaibi, Shaikh Muhammad bin Husain al-Qahtani, Professor Muhammad bin Nasir al-Ghamidi, Walid al-Majid and Professor Abd al-Karim al-Khadhar, were detained on 17 February 2011. HRW stated that the five \\"appear to have been detained solely for trying to create a party whose professed aims included greater democracy and protection for human rights.\\" Prior to his own arrest, al-Khadhar stated that his colleagues were apparently held in  ΩUlaysha Prison. Khaled al-Johani, who was detained on 11 March 2011 in Riyadh, a would-be \\"Day of Rage\\" during the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests, after talking about democracy, freedom, freedom of speech and justice to BBC Arabic Television reporters, has been held since then in  ΩUlaysha Prison. He was not allowed contact with his family for the first 58 days of his detention. While al-Johani remained under detention in  ΩUlaysha Prison, HRW described him as a \\"peaceful dissident\\" and Mohammad al-Qahtani of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association said that al-Johani became known online as \\"the only brave man in Saudi Arabia\\", because he appeared to be the only person who publicly protested in Saudi Arabia on 11 March, apart from several hundreds of protestors in Qatif, Hofuf and al-Awamiyah. Conditions of detention Amnesty International reported the torture allegations of a Yemeni prisoner arrested in 2002 who stated that he was tortured every three to four days over his first 56 days of detention in the prison. He alleged that techniques used against him included being punched \\"in the face until blood burst out of [his] mouth\\", being beaten all over his body and \\"on the soles of the feet and legs while [his] legs were shackled\\", and \\"put under the air conditioner for a few hours\\". He was held at  ΩUlaysha for eight months, of which the first 56 days were in a two metre by one metre size cell. He was then transferred to al-Ha'ir Prison.

Together with his father-in-law, Mike Campbell, he rose to international prominence after 2008 for suing the regime of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe for violating rule of law and human rights in Zimbabwe. Freeth and Campbell's lawsuit against the Mugabe regime‚Äîthe case of Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe‚Äîwas chronicled in the award-winning 2009 documentary film Mugabe and the White African. Background Freeth was born in Sittingbourne, Kent in southern England, the son of a British military family. After the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980, the family relocated to the country where Freeth's father had been hired by the Zimbabwean government to set up a new staff training college for the newly established national army. Freeth attended Aiglon College and went on to study at the Royal Agricultural College in Gloucestershire, England. He then returned to Zimbabwe and married Laura Campbell, the daughter of white African farmer Mike Campbell and his wife Angela. The Freeths built a house on the Campbells' Mount Carmel estate in Chegutu and Freeth eventually became an official with the Commercial Farmers' Union. They are the parents of three children.Whites huddle and pray as mob closes in ‚Äì The Times OnlineZimbabwe - White farms being torched ‚Äì Meat Trade News Daily \\"They built a house at Mount Carmel, the 12,000-hectare estate bought by her father, Mike, for a commercial farming and safari enterprise.\\" During the early 1970s, Campbell, a South African Army captain, was involved in the Rhodesian Bush War that pitted Rhodesia's mostly white government against black nationalist guerrillas. He moved to Mount Carmel farm in 1974. He added a neighbouring plot of land in 1980, following Zimbabwean independence. As well as farming, Campbell set up an extensive nature reserve on the property, replete with giraffes, impala and other indigenous animals. He also created the Biri River Safari Lodge, which became a popular tourist attraction.Mike Campbell Obituary ‚Äì The Telegraph Campbell purchased Mount Carmel from himself after independence (the full title was vested in 1999, when the Zimbabwean government declared no interest in the land). Together, Freeth and Mike Campbell managed the farm's operations and employed a sizeable number of local farm labourers while Laura oversaw a linen factory on the estate which employed many of the farm workers' wives.Mike Campbell Obituary ‚Äì The Guardian The Mount Carmel estate was described as a model employer. By the late 1990s, it had become the largest mango producer in Zimbabwe. It also produced maize, tobacco and sunflowers and sustained the livelihoods of more than 500 local Zimbabwean people. In 1999, ownership of the farm was transferred into a family company by a \\"certificate of no interest\\" from the Mugabe government. Every farm bought after independence in 1980 had to be offered to the government first for possible land redistribution and then deeds were stamped \\"No Government Interest\\" if the government did not wish to purchase it.Mike Campbell Obituary ‚Äì The Telegraph Lawsuit against Robert Mugabe In 2001, however, the Freeths and Campbells were issued an eviction notice from the Mugabe government as part of Mugabe's controversial land reform programme. Under this programme, several thousand white-owned farms have been repossessed without compensation by the Zimbabwean government. While the stated intention of the programme is to redistribute land to disadvantaged Zimbabweans, many of the repossessed lands have in fact been given to government officials and others loyal to the Mugabe government. Subsequently, many of these farms have fallen into disrepair and are no longer active.Lucy Bailey and Andrew Thompson, directors. Mugabe and the White African, (documentary film) 2009. Freeth and Campbell chose to dispute the eviction order in court. After having been defeated in the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, they took their case to the SADC Tribunal, a regional court of the Southern African Development Community. During the course of the case, Freeth, together with Mike and Angela Campbell, was abducted and beaten by Mugabe supporters.Freeth Abducted in Zimbabwe ‚Äì The Telegraph The tribunal eventually ruled in Freeth and Campbell's favour, finding that the Zimbabwean government's land repossessions were entirely racially based and, therefore, were in violation of the SADC's principles of human rights. The government of Zimbabwe was ordered to respect Freeth and Campbell's right to own and operate their farm.Mike Campbell Obituary ‚Äì The Telegraph The Mugabe government ignored the ruling and later withdrew Zimbabwe from the SADC. In August 2009, the Mount Carmel estate was invaded by Mugabe supporters and Freeth and Campbell's homes were burned down, as were the homes of the farm's workers and their families. The Freeths and Campbells, as well as their workers, were driven from the property. As of 2011, the Mount Carmel estate has become derelict and overgrown. Mike Campbell died in April 2011, though Freeth has stated his intention to continue fighting to take back ownership of the property.Mike Campbell Obituary ‚Äì The Guardian Honours In June 2010, Freeth was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his human rights activism in Zimbabwe.Zimbabwean Farmer Awarded MBE ‚Äì The Zimbabwean References Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Zimbabwean farmers Category:Zimbabwean prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Zimbabwe Category:Zimbabwean human rights activists Category:Zimbabwean torture victims Category:People from Mashonaland West Province Category:British emigrants to Zimbabwe Category:Zimbabwean people of English descent Category:People from Kent Category:People from Sittingbourne Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Racially motivated violence against white people ","title":"Ben Freeth"},{"id":"32073588","text":"The Crimson Candle is a 1934 British crime film directed by Bernard Mainwaring and starring Eve Gray, Eliot Makeham and Kenneth Kove.BFI.org Plot A doctor attempts to prove that a maid is a murderer.

These proteins line the inner surface of viral envelopes and are associated with viral membranes. Matrix proteins are produced as N-terminal domains of Gag precursor polyproteins. The Gag polyprotein directs the assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The Gag polyprotein has three domains required for activity: an N-terminal membrane- binding (M) domain (which corresponds to the matrix protein) that directs Gag to the plasma membrane, an interaction (I) domain involved in Gag aggregation, and a late assembly (L) domain that mediates the budding process . During viral maturation, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved by the retroviral protease into several corresponding structural proteins, yielding the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins, and some smaller peptides. Gag- derived proteins govern the entire assembly and release of the virus particles, with matrix proteins playing key roles in Gag stability, capsid assembly, transport and budding. Families of retroviral matrix proteins Although matrix proteins from different viruses appear to perform similar functions and can have similar structural folds, their primary sequences can be very different. Typical matrix proteins of retroviruses form an alpha helical bundle structure . One family of these proteins represents matrix proteins from gammaretroviruses, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), feline leukemia virus (FLV), and feline sarcoma virus (FESV). This family also includes matrix proteins from several eukaryotic endogenous retroviruses, which arise when one or more copies of the retroviral genome becomes integrated into the host genome. Another family represents the M domain of the Gag polyprotein found in avian retroviruses. It includes Gag polyproteins from several avian endogenous retroviruses. Matrix proteins are also components of beta-retroviruses such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) .

The songs were mainly composed by Blades ranging in theme from the political to the comical/playful. \\"Tibur√≥n\\" has since become widely considered one of the highlights of Rub√©n Blades' songwriting career. Reception Although Grammy-nominated, Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos received little air play in the United States at the time of its release due to the political slant of the song \\"Tibur√≥n\\" (literally, \\"Shark\\") referring to U.S. hegemony in Latin America. The main opposition to the composition came from the Cuban communities in the U.S. In 1991 Willie Col√≥n reflected, \\"that type of composition caused us a lot of trouble, so much so that at one point when we were doing \\"Pedro Navaja\\" and \\"Tibur√≥n\\" with Blades, we had to perform in bulletproof vests.\\" However, reception was much warmer in Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries, where \\"Tibur√≥n\\", \\"Te Est√°n Buscando\\" and \\"Ligia Elena\\" were major radio hits.

Roberts, produced by Oswald Stoll and starring Lyn Harding, Hilda Bayley and Arthur PuseyWorkman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\". Midnight Marquee Press. p. 213.. BFI.org It ran 72 minutes in length. The screenplay was written by R. Byron-Webber, based on the eponymous stage play by Walter C. Hackett, which was first staged in England in October, 1917. The cinematographer was E. Harvey Harrison. Producer Stoll emigrated to England from Australia, and opened a chain of British movie theaters and later moved into film production. He formed Stoll Picture Productions in 1919, and made seven feature films that year alone. When his longer length films didn't do well, he switched to making short subjects adapting best-selling novels of the day, featuring characters such as Sherlock Holmes and Fu Manchu. He chose to make this film based on the success of the film Mr. Wu, which came out in 1919. Stoll tended toward xenophobia, hence he would generally make non-white foreigners the guilty party in his films. He followed this film up with another \\"Yellow Peril\\" film, The Yellow Claw by Sax Rohmer, which in turn was followed by twenty-three short Fu Manchu movies He later became a philanthropist and received a knighthood in 1919 for his charity work, finding housing for military veterans with mental illnesses. Plot Beverly Barton attempts to blackmail Mrs. Standish with some scandalous letters, and is murdered soon after in his apartment. Mrs. Standish's brother-in-law to be, Harry Maitland, is suspected of shooting him, since he had gone to Barton's apartment earlier to try to retrieve the incriminating letters.

Launched on 11 May 1948, she was the third-largest ship being built in a UK shipyard at that time. Built as a replacement for a ship lost during the Second World War, she was to serve on route between England and the east coast of South America. She was wrecked on her maiden voyage in 1949, the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to suffer this fate. The insurance payout of ¬£2,295,000 was the largest made at the time for a marine casualty in the United Kingdom. Due to changing trading conditions RML decided not to build a replacement vessel. Description Magdalena was long overall ( between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of (SLL). She was propelled by two Parsons steam turbines, double reduction geared, driving twin screws. Developing , they could propel the ship at . Magdalena had five holds for the carriage of refrigerated cargo, three forward and two aft, for a total of . Internally she was divided into nine watertight compartments. She was of part- riveted and part-welded construction, with a double bottom. She was certificated to carry 251 crew and 529 passengers. She was assessed at , , 9,725 DWT. History RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel had been laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a passenger certificate for the ship. In 1947 it was reported that delivery would be delayed until the end of 1948 and that the cost of building her would be considerably higher than the estimated cost when the order was placed. She was built to replace , which had been sunk in 1940. Magdalena was the first passenger ship built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast after the end of the war and the third-largest being built in the United Kingdom at that time. The ship was the third in the Royal Mail Lines fleet to carry the name Magdalena, she was built to serve on the Tilbury ‚Äì Cherbourg ‚Äì Vigo ‚Äì Lisbon ‚Äì Las Palmas ‚Äì Pernambuco ‚Äì Bahia ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro ‚Äì Santos ‚Äì Montevideo ‚Äì Buenos Aires route. She was launched on 11 May 1948. Her passenger certificate was issued on 18 February 1949. Her port of registry was London. The Official Number 182955 and Code Letters GFQD were allocated. Magdalena left London on her maiden voyage on 9 March 1949, bound for Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her captain was on his final voyage before retirement. She called at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands on 15 March, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 24 March. She reached Buenos Aires, where a cargo of of meat was loaded, and called at Santos where a cargo of oranges was loaded. Carrying 237 crew and 347 passengers, she left Santos on 24 April, passing south of the Isle of Moela and the Isle of San Sebastian. Magdalenas course was more northerly than that intended, and adjustments were made twice on the orders of her captain. She passed Boi Point, San Sebastian at 19:56 and her course was altered to pass about north of the Palmas Island Lighthouse, at the entrance to Rio de Janeiro Harbour. The captain retired to bed at about 22:45, leaving written orders to be called when the ship was at a bearing of 315¬∞ off the Garituba Lighthouse. As Magdalena was not due at Rio de Janeiro until the morning, her speed was reduced to . At 02:30 on 25 April, she was some north of her intended position and another adjustment was made to her heading. By 03:30, she was on course and the bearing of 315¬∞ to the Guarituba Lighthouse was obtained at 03:49, at which point the captain was called. Having checked that all was well, he left orders to be called at 04:30. At 04:00, the watch changed; the incoming watch were informed that the ship's course would mean that it would pass close to the Tijucas Rocks. Shortly before 04:30, a fix was obtained which showed that Magdalena was again north of her intended position. The captain was called as ordered and informed that arrival off Palmas Island would be at about 05:07. The first officer then took another fix as he was unsure of the accuracy of the first fix. He had just returned to the bridge when something was seen in the water ahead of them, which the Third Officer took to be a ship without lights. The order \\"port, 3 degrees\\" was given, followed by \\"hard-a-starboard\\" immediately before Magdalena struck the Tijucas Rocks, located between the Carragas Islands and the Palmas Islands. The time of the grounding was 04:40. An SOS was broadcast, which was answered by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers were ordered to take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guapor√© arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trov√£o, and also the cargo ship Goiaz. Magdalena was refloated at 23:34. Her No.3 compartment was flooded and she was down by the bows. Tugs were sent to tow her the into Rio de Janeiro. The tow started at 07:00 on 26 April, making slow progress, with the ship being towed stern first and making just . Her bows were drawing of water. She was abeam of Sugarloaf Mountain when she began to split in two forward of her aft superstructure. This happened as the ship was passing over a sandbank at the harbour mouth, which lay at a depth of about . The anchors were then dropped. The remaining passengers and crew abandoned ship, with the last three leaving just before Magdalena broke up. The bow section remained at anchor in the Guanabara Bay, The bow section slowly sank, being noticeably deeper in the water by 29 April. It finally sank on 30 April, with its foremast clear of the water marking its position (). Much of her cargo of oranges washed up on Copacabana Beach. Salvage of the bow section was officially abandoned on 7 June. The wreck now lies in of water. The stern section drifted aground at the opposite side to the bay to where the bow section remained. The passengers' baggage was salvaged, as well as mail being carried. Of her cargo, of frozen meat was salvaged, with hopes that a further would also be salvageable, as well as 2,000 of the 12,000 cases of oranges. They were shipped to the United Kingdom aboard . Salvage operations were abandoned on 25 May, and it was decided to sell her remains for scrap. Magdalenas stern section was towed to Imbu√≠ Bay, and was sold for ¬£50,000. Her steam turbines were used for many years to generate electricity for Manaus. The ship's bell and some other small parts, including some portholes are preserved at the Jurujuba Yacht Club, Niter√≥i. The wreck of the bow section was a hazard to shipping until at least the 1970s, but has since been mostly demolished. It is difficult to dive due to strong currents in the area, poor visibility and anchoring in the busy shipping lane being banned. On 4 May, Magdalena was declared to be a total loss, making her the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to be lost on her maiden voyage. Her insurers paid out ¬£2,295,000 to Royal Mail Lines by cheque on 16 May. At the time, this was the biggest payout for a marine casualty in the United Kingdom. It was decided that a replacement ship would not be built. Investigation A preliminary enquiry into Magdalenas was held at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent a report to the Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry was held at the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26‚Äì28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949. Reunion In April 1996 a reunion was held at Belfast of people who had either helped to build or worked on board Magdalena. It was organised by the Lagan Legacy heritage organisation. Four of the seven people contacted attended the reunion, with one coming from Australia. Notes # The others were in 1889, in 1912, in 1916, in 1920, and RFA Dinsdale in 1942. Brecknockshire and Dinsdale were lost due to enemy action.

Early Lordship  He was knighted before 1218 and took the residence at the castle at Heusden and the title of Lord of Heusden on September 21, 1223, and shortly after succeeded his father as lord of Bornheim, of Saint-Jean Steen and as chatellenie of Ghent. He continued his families support for the abbey of Saint Bavo. Before his father passed he was married to Odette of Champagne, daughter of Odo II of Champlitte (who died shortly after taking part in the siege of Constantinople). Thus, from his wife, Hugh gained lordship of the village of Champlitte, which he sold to William of Vergy, brother of Alice of Vergy, duchess consort of Burgundy. About the same time (March 1228), he established some taxes and corresponding rights to the inhabitants of Baesrode Saint Marie, which outlined some of the rights and duties of citizens and public officials.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le ch√¢teau et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomt√© de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 141-144  Involvement with Ferdinand, Count of Flanders  Before 1226, Ferdinand, Count of Flanders had been held captive by Louis, future king of France.

An ATR system converts municipal solid waste (MSW) into either electricity or steam for district heating or industrial customers. The combustion bottom ash and the combustion fly ash, along with the air pollution control system fly ash, are treated to produce products that can be beneficially reused. Specifically, ATR systems consist of the following: * Solid waste combustion, boiler and combustion control system, energy recovery and air pollution control equipment; * Combustion bottom ash and fly ash treatment systems that produce commercially reusable products; and * An optional pre-processing system to recover recyclable materials contained in the MSW delivered to the facility before the MSW enters the thermal processing area of the facility.  Application in Germany  As a result of the growing need to manage waste from throughout greater Hamburg, the first commercially operating ATR facility ‚Äì the M√ºllverwertung Rugenberger Damm (MVR) in Hamburg, Germany ‚Äì was commissioned in 1999. The German Green Party has endorsed the specific features of the MVR facility in its \\"Concept 2020\\" initiative to cease all landfilling of waste by 2020 as an essential part of an integrated waste management system achieving the highest standards in the EfW industry. No landfilling of unprocessed waste has been allowed in Germany since 2005, and all 27 countries in the European Community are required to adopt similar bans by 2020.  ATR process description  Quality control occurs at the inception of the process. Overhead refuse cranes, which hold approximately 5 tons each, mix the waste in the bunker to create a homogeneous mixture. This is important for good combustion and low carbon content in the bottom ash by-product. These cranes then deliver the mixed waste into the feeding hopper which leads down onto highly engineered stoker grates which control the rate that waste travels through the boiler. The intense heat ignites the waste as it moves along the forward feeding grates until only the by-product bottom ash remains at the end of the grate. Each combustion line feeds a boiler that operates at a temperature above for 2 seconds. The temperature in the combustion zone is measured through acoustic monitoring. Careful monitoring of the combustion process guarantees complete burning of the combustible material in an environmentally safe manner. A highly sophisticated computer controls the temperature, the grate speed, the amount of air used and all other aspects of the process that enables complete combustion and minimization of emissions to occur. The maintenance of the furnace's high temperature is essential to rid the waste and the resulting combustion gases of complex organic compounds such as dioxin/furans. To prevent the reformulation of pollutants, fly ash is separated from the flue gas downstream of the super heaters to reduce the fly ash content, which could act as a catalyst in the critical reformulation temperature range of . At the exit of the boiler, the flue gas has been cooled down to a level of . Converting waste heat to electricity. As the waste is combusted, heat is released in the boiler. This heat is used to produce high- pressure, high-temperature, super-heated steam, which generates electrical energy when passed through a turbine-generator. The electricity is fed into the public power grid or can be sold directly to a customer. The steam can also be exported directly for use in district heating or industrial processes. Air pollution control. Each unit has an independent air pollution control system. Flue gas cleaning begins in the boiler, where oxides of nitrogen are reduced by injecting ammonia water into the combustion chamber. Lightly loaded absorbents (activated carbon from the second bag house) are injected into the flue gas downstream of the first bag house to separate any contaminants that have reformed (such as organic compounds like dioxins and furans), any condensed heavy metals, salts and other gaseous contaminants, as well as residue fly ash. The first bag house is an essential part of the air pollution control system insofar as it makes it possible to produce reusable by-products such as hydrochloric acid and gypsum from the consecutive air pollution control process steps. Acid gases are removed from the flue gases by passing through a two-stage scrubber to remove acid components, especially halogen compounds such as hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. A counter flow neutral scrubber follows, using a lime slurry to remove sulphur oxides (SO2, SO3). The pollutant gases are either dissolved in water droplets (acids) or bound as calcium salts (SO2, SO3) and thereby are successfully removed from the flue gas. A second bag house acts as a polishing filter to capture any remaining aerosols, organic compounds and heavy metals, which thereby are reduced to levels usually below detection. Converting combustion residue to marketable byproducts. The ATR process produces other marketable products in addition to energy. Following combustion, the material left consists of the non-combustible components of the waste and the inert materials produced during combustion. This is known as slag or bottom ash. The bottom ash is washed to eliminate soluble salts. Iron scrap and non-ferrous metals such as aluminium, copper and brass are separated and sold in secondary metals markets The bottom ash is then screened, crushed and sold for use as a construction material comparable to aggregate mined from a quarry or made from processed demolition waste. Gypsum is created when the oxides of sulphur (SO2 and SO3) are separated by the single stage scrubber. It is purified, then sold to the construction industry. The acid scrubbing process in the flue gas treatment system also produces a raw hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a concentration of 10%-12%. The acid is distilled (rectified) to yield commercial grade (30% concentration) hydrochloric acid. Fly Ash Treatment. Fly ash, which is separated in the boiler and baghouses and constitutes up to 5% by weight of the combusted MSW, is treated to recover metals and minerals for reuse, resulting in an overall ATR process landfill diversion rate of approximately 98.5%.  Advantages of ATR  ATR systems offer flue gas cleanup and emissions performance that meet or exceed the strictest clean air laws in the United States and the European Union. Emissions from an ATR plant contain fewer metals, dioxins and conventional pollutants than other EfW approaches. ATR systems increase a facility‚Äôs ‚Äúdiversion rate‚Äù ‚Äì the percentage of materials coming into plants that are destroyed or converted to energy and useful byproducts. The majority of EfW plants in the US, after incineration and recovery of some metals, combine both bottom ash and fly ash (20-25% of MSW input by weight) and send it to a landfill. ATR systems, by contrast, landfill less than 2 percent of a plant‚Äôs MSW input; all remaining MSW is converted into either energy or usable products.

The box set was designed as the next step for Dungeon Masters after the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set (2010) as part of the revamp of 4th edition. Greg Tito, for Escapist Magazine, wrote that Mike Mearls \\"intended the Essentials line ‚Äì essentially a repackaging of 4E rules into easier-to-digest books ‚Äì to get back to the shared language that unites all D&D; players\\". Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, wrote that \\"September and October 2010 saw the publication of the first four books of the Essentials line: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set (2010), Rules Compendium (2010), Dungeon Master's Kit (2010), and the first players book, Heroes of the Fallen Lands (2010). Now, in November 2010, the set of six rules-oriented releases for Essentials was drawing to a close.

On November 19, 2013, Dungeon Master's Kit was re-released as a PDF. This PDF only contains the original rulebook and the two adventure booklets.  Reception  On the Essentials line, M.J. Harnish, for Wired, commented that \\"for the past few years, starting with the very announcement of 4E and the Virtual Tabletop debacle, Wizards has been very poor at communicating honestly and openly with its fan base and has put out a string of very sub-par or poorly supported products, many of which saw errata almost immediately after their release. [...] Confusing titles and formats (for example, the adoption of the digest-size books for the Essentials line and then subsequent abandonment of that format) didn't help the matter\\". Critical-Hits strong dislike of the product led them to publish an editorial rather than a traditional review: \\"Here‚Äôs my beef with the product: taken alone as a product, this boxed set is extremely useful to new DMs, but as a product line, D&D; Essential lost a lot of its new shine when I realized that this book reprinted, word for word, large swaths of text from the Rules Compendium and Heroes of Fallen Lands! [...] Please don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ I love the Essential line so far, especially the new PC builds, yet I fear that many customers like myself are going to have similar, negative reactions when they go through the books. [...] The D&D; Essentials DM Kit is an excellent, high quality product for new DMs that graduate from the Red Box\\". Kevin Kulp, game designer and admin of the independent D&D; fansite ENWorld, commented that this \\"is the boxed set that many people wish that 4e D&D; had started off with, instead of the actual DMG; it's a beautifully illustrated, clearly organized, rewritten guide to running 4e D&D.; They got this one right. [...] I want to call out the superior art and layout design in this book. For new players in particular, being able to visualize and imagine the world they‚Äôre playing in is critical. The D&D; Essentials line has taken this truism to heart. In every piece of art, from cartography to combat diagrams to the vibrant and action- filled illustrations, the magical tone and feel of the game comes through.

It was built 1854‚Äì55 and converted to a theatre in 1979. Historic England has designated the theatre a Grade II* listed building. History The Mechanics' Institute was built 1854‚Äì55 to a design by Todmorden architect James Green. Sir Charles Towneley opened the institute in 1855. It was a club for \\"reading and discussion by an 'earnest few'\\". As the town grew, the institute increasingly became a social and cultural community centre. Architect William Waddington enlarged the building in 1888. Burnley Borough Council bought the building in 1959 and leased it to companies for a variety of leisure purposes. In 1979, the interior was reconstructed as a theatre. Burnley Mechanics was designated a Grade II* listed building by Historic England on 29 September 1977. The Grade II* designation‚Äîthe second highest of the three grades‚Äîis for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It is described by Hartwell and Pevsner as \\"one of Burnley's best buildings\\". John Champness calls its fa√ßade \\"certainly the finest Classical fa√ßade in Burnley and among the very best of its date in the country\\". Architecture Burnley Mechanics is built in the Palazzo style in sandstone ashlar. Green's original construction is on a rectangular plan with five bays at the front; it is on two storeys. The ground floor has Venetian-style windows with round, rusticated arches. Waddington's extension at the rear of the building is on a slightly lower level. Its design matches that of the rest of the building, but the newer windows have architraves with pilasters. On the second floor, there are central windows flanked by Corinthian columns and pilasters. The entrances to the building have coupled Corinthian columns.
